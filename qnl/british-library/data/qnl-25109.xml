[42327] No. 1. Lord Ronaldshay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received October 27.) Dear Grrey, House of Commons, October 1911. CONSIDERABLE progress has been made during the laSt^weeE or two with certain preliminary arrangements in connection with the proposed trans-Persian Railway, and I have been asked to ascertain whether, and, if so, to what extent, the British Eoreign Office would be prepared to support the promoters of the scheme. May I remind, you that a Russian committee has been in existence for some time; that they are in possession of rough surveys of the Russian portion of the projected line ; and that they have worked out rough estimates of the cost of construction of, and probable earnings of, the whole line from Russia to India. Further, that they have the support of the Russian Government; and that on their sending delegates to England last summer they were given to understand that the scheme had the general support of the British Foreign Office. Now, as to the British portion of the proposed scheme. Certain individuals interested in the project are prepared to form an English committee, corresponding to the Russian committee. They are in a position to find the capital, not only for preliminary investigations but for the construction of the line, on certain conditions. These conditions are that the British Government will join the Russian Govern ment in submitting the proposal of a through line from Russia to India to the Persian Government, and, in the event of the Persian Government assenting to the proposition, give to the scheme their support. It is felt that before the capital is produced it would be necessary to have the concession embodied in some form of convention, signed by the Governments of the three countries. I ought to add that it is a French financial house that has declared itself ready to find the capital on these terms, though I believe that they have approached Lord Revelstoke and suggested to him that he should act with them. Can you give me some idea as to what attitude you would take up on behalf of the Foreign Office towards such a proposal if it were laid before you formally by such a committee as I have suggested ? Perhaps I might see you some time at the Foreign Office or here ? Yours sincerely, RONALDSHAY. / ft y / (l EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

From—The Secretary, Karachi Chamber of Commerce, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. On the occasion of His Excellency the Viceroy’s visit at Karachi in April last, this Chamber presented an address Indo-Persiaa Trunk Railway. 0 f we lcome to Lord Hardinge, in the course of which the following reference to the proposed Trans-Persian Railway ap peared :— “ The question of linking India with Europe by means of a Trans-Persian Railway is now engaging the attention of European financiers. The Chamber notice that the proposal has taken the form of connecting the Russian Railways of the Caucasus with the Indian Railway System at Nushki. We would respectfully submit, for Your Excellency s con sideration, that the best route for such a line of communication would be by way of Bam, Southern Baluchistan (i. e. Panjgur) and Karachi. This route would have the advantage of tapping fertile country and, moreover, would find its terminus in a rising commercial seaport . To this representation His Excellency replied:— “ It is impossible to say at present whether or when the proposed Trans- Persian line will become a realisable project. The present situation in the south of Persia is not one which offers much encouragement to capitalists to finance such schemes, but the question of the construc tion of this line has been under the serious consideration of the Govern ment of India ; and the claims of Karachi as a terminus of a line passing through Southern Baluchistan have not been lost sight of It has now been brought to the notice of my Committee that the question of hypothecating surplus Persian revenues with the object of guaranteeing a local railway to the Persian Gulf is now under consideration. As such a hypothecation would in all probability indefinitely postpone the construction of an Indo-European Trunk Railway through Persia, my Committee decided to wire to you as under : Chamber has received information that the hypothecation of Persian revenues to support local Persian railway to Persian Gulf is under consideration, and that decision is to be arrived at this week by British Foreign Office. The Chamber \ urges that larger scheme of Trans-Persian railway linking Russian and Indian \ railway systems is more deserving of support. Chamber begs further to urge that British Government be asked by telegraph not to assent to hypothecation of Persian surplus revenues for local railway till claims of India for railway communi cation with Persia and Europe have received thorough consideration. The Committee trust that the Government of India have been able to aee their way to take action as indicated above.To India Office. Sept. 28rd. 1910, Forei.-pi Office. London S.'ot.

On neither ground does it appear possible for any sufficient case in favour of the proposed line to be made out to enable a Government guarantee to be defended on a purely commercial basis, and the Board see no reason to modify the opinions expressed in their letter of the 13th September, 1910, as to the commercial prospects of the undertaking.

Treasury Chambers, November 13, 1911. laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 31st August last, with its enclosures, dealing with the proposals for constructing a Trans-Persian Railway, and enquiring whether, in their Lordships’ opinion, His Majesty’s Government would be justified in undertaking to guarantee the line. In reply, I am to request you to inform the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs that my Lords gather from a perusal of the papers submitted that, while the proposal may have a certain political value as a counterpoise to German enterprise in the adjacent regions, it is put forward in the main in the interests of Russian trade. They note that the Russian Government, while sympathising with the aims of the promoters, is at present in no way committed to approval of the scheme as a whole, and that, even in the event of such approval being ultimately given, they hold out no hope of any direct State assistance to the project beyond the possibility that any additional profits arising upon the Russian State railways as a result of through traffic with the new line might be treated as a guarantee fund for that undertaking. In these circumstances, it appears to my Lords that the most which could' be asked from the British side Avould be a similar undertaking with regard to Indian railway profits. ~ Whether this should be offered is, of course, a question for the Government of India, but their Lordships imagine that the prospect of Indian Railway profits being materially augmented as a result of the construction of the line is so remote that such an undertaking would be of little practical value to the promoters. Indeed—and this applies equally to the Russian suggestion—the prospect of a guarantee fund dependent for its existence upon the success of the undertaking is scarcely likely to prove attractive to investors who will seek protection rather against its failure. I am to add that even if Russia were prepared to take part in a joint guarantee of interest upon the capital expended, and if reliable estimates could be furnished of the probable expenditure and of the working expenses and traffic receipts when the line was completed, and such estimates showed a reasonable prospect of commercial success, the objections in principle to involving the Exchequer in liabilities in respect of commercial undertakings outside the British Empire are so strong, that my Lords would be most unwilling to submit any proposal of the kind indicated to Parliament. These conditions are, however, by no means fulfilled. The attitude of the Russian Government has already been referred to. As regards cost of construction, such surveys as may have been made appear to be insufficient to determine even the practicability of the alternative routes (between which no decision has yet been arrived at), and can clearly provide no basis for an estimate of capital expenditure, while the estimate of receipts is based upon an arbitrary hypothesis of trade to be created as the result of opening up the country by the railway itself, without apparent regard to the character of the country to be traversed or to the wealth or numners of the population to be served. On the facts before them, my Lords see no sort of security that tne guarantee, if given, would not be called upon up to the full amount of the interest on the capital expenditure involved (estimated at over 20,000,000/.), and, in these circumstances, the proposal does not appear to be one which His Majesty’s Government can take into serious consideration.

When calling on you this morning on behalf of Lord Revelstoke, Lord Errington took the opportunity of submitting to you the letter received by Lord Revelstoke from the Russian Minister of Finance, announcing the visit to this country of the Russian promoters of the scheme for a trans-continental railway through Persia. In relating to you the nature of the conversation held between these Russian gentlemen, whose names are already known to you, and our selves, Lord Errington had occasion to mention that the Russian Government had expressed their unwillingness to afford any direct financial guarantee towards the furthering of the scheme in question. In this respect we understand that the British Government would adopt a similar attitude, and decline to give any direct financial guarantee for railway construction in Persia. At the same time, mention was made of the fact that the Russian Government had informed the promoters that they were prepared to consider the question of an indirect guarantee to the scheme in contem plation by reserving a certain proportion of their railway revenue surplus for this purpose, in consideration of the increased traffic on lines in Russian territory, which would necessarily accrue from the opening of a trans-Persian Railway to India. It was suggested to us by the Russian gentlemen now in London that in view of the interest with which the Government of India may regard this scheme, they may see their way to expressing an opinion as S. 96. Bto any stops they may he prepared to take in furthering the projected hne, which has heen brought to our notice by our Itussian filends, in deference to whose wishes we venture to appioach you m this matter.

I beo’ to enclose herewith a memorandum on a trunk railway through Persia which has been drawn up at your suggestion by the members of the Russian committee at present in London deputed for negotiations in England. As my friends intend to leave London on Wednesday morning, they request you to give them an appointment to-day or to-morrow, in order to report to you on the progress of their work here. I also request you on behalf of my friends to address all future communications to'me, as the only representative of the Russian com mittee living in London. All communications should be addressed to the above address, or to 3, Whitehall Court, S.W. (telephone 3160 Victoria). I beg to hand you * Not printed. herewith ten copies of “ Brief Notes on the Preliminary Expenses for the Con struction of a Trans-continental Railway through Persia. I remain, &amp;c., Abh. Goukassow. Annex 3. M. Homiakoff to Sir A. Nicolson. Sir, 17th July 1911. The rapid development of civilisation in Central Asia and the need of better communication with Europe has caused public opinion in Russia to recognise clearly the necessity of constructing an overland route through Persia to connect the existing railway systems of Europe with those of the rich and densely populated regions of India and south eastern Asia. With this object in view a Russian committee has been formed in Russia (1) to study the possibility of the construction of such a route ; and (2). to ascertain the views of the Russian Government on the subject. After a close investigation based on data including materials of the Ministries concerned, the Russian committee have come to the con clusion— That the trunk line through Persia must be constructed by a single international company, in which the Russian and English interests shall predominate, and in which interests other than English or Russian may or may not be admitted according to agreement with the British Government and with the English Committee, which should later be formed. That it is an indispensable condition for the commercial success of the railway, that the line through Persia should be as short and straight as possible, in order to enable it to compete both with other existingmeans of transit and possible future lines. With this object in view the committee have decided on a route to pass from Baku through Astara, Tehran, and Kerman to Nushki. But it is clearly understood that if, from the British point of view, Nushki be found unsuitable as the point of junction with the Indian railway system, and if Knrrachee be recommended instead, the alteration could be adopted without affecting the commercial success of the line, providing, however, that the section between Kerman and Kurrachee should run as far as is practicable in a due south-easterly direction without any unnecessary deviations which would lengthen the line as a whole. The Russian committee have also studied the financial prospects of such a line, have made a rough estimate of the cost of construction, and have examined .the possible effect of such a line on the increase of profits for the Russian railway system. The conclusions at which the committee have arrived in this respect are embodied in a substantial report, a brief extract of which has been handed to the representative of the British Government and to two of the leading bankers in London. Having secured the approval of the Russian Government, the Russian committee have at the same time interested all the leading Russian banks, and they (the banks) have subscribed a capital of 300,000 roubles for further preliminary investigation. The Russian committee have now r concluded the first part of the task, and have come to the conclusion that the moment has arrived when a “ societe d’etudes ” should be formed including the representatives of at least the tw r o most concerned nations outside Persia, be., England and Russia. With this object in view the Russian committee have deputed the undersigned to come to London and to approach both the British Government and the financiers of London in order to form jointly such a “ societe d’etudes ” for further preliminary investigation, for nego tiations with the Persian Government to obtain the necessary concessions and also for the final formation of the company for the construction of the railway. As mentioned above, we have approached the leading financial houses and also some leading public men of England who stand for a closer relationship between the two countries, and w r e are glad to state that we have found them most favourably disposed towards the realisation of our object. But it has been pointed out to us that before anv definite steps towards the formation of a “ societe d’etudes ” could be undertaken, two points of importance should be settled : firstly, the question of the final alignment of the section between Kerman and Kurracbee; and, secondly, whether the British Government or the Government of India would to any extent be prepared to support the promoters on the English side in the same way as the Russian Govern ment and the Russian banks are prepared to support the Russian promoters of the scheme. Our friends here have pointed out to us that whereas we in Russia have already collected 300,000 roubles for our share of the preliminary expenses (which sum includes further preliminary investigation, technical survey, and the expenses for the formation of the company, and whereas we can reckon on some support from the Russian Government, as pointed out in our printed report, they are unable as yet to gauge the extent of support which the British Government or the Government of India would be prepared to give them in case they decided to collaborate with us. This being the position at the moment, the undersigned are of opinion that at this stage the co-operation of the British Government is highly desirable, and we beg to submit the matter to your consideration. I remain, &amp;c., (On behalf of the Russian Committee), N. Homiakoff.Annex 4. Mr. Huth Jackson to Sir A. Nicolson. (Received 19th July.) 12, Tokenhouse Yard, Dear Sir Arthur, 18th July 1911. M. P. L. Bark, Managing Director of the Volga Kama Commercial Bank, and M. A. 0. Goukassow asked me to give them another interview, and I have seen them this afternoon. They told me that they had seen Lord Revelstoke, and had also sent you a memorandum upon the Persian Railway scheme at your request. They particularly wished to have my views as to the possibility of forming a London group prepared to join with Russian and French groups in examining the whole project, and sharing in the cost of this examination—which is estimated at 120,000Z. In my reply I began by reminding them of what I had said on a previous occasion—and what I believe that you had also told them— that 1 was not a financier, and that, therefore, neither I nor my firm would participate in the scheme. They replied that they fully understood this. I then went on to say that, looking at the matter as a business proposition, it would in my opinion be impossible to form any such financial group in London as was suggested, unless—■ 1. The actual route for the railway had been approved both by the Russian and the British and Indian Governments—which was, I understood, at present not the case. 2. Unless there were satisfactory and sufficient guarantees forth coming, which would enable the necessary funds to build the railway to be raised later on. They then asked me whether I thought the British or Indian Govern ments would be willing to give any guarantees. I replied that I thought it extremely unlikely that the British Government would, under any circumstances, give a guarantee ; while, even if the Indian Government were to entertain the idea, they would be sure to limit their guarantee to capital spent on that portion of the railway which passed through Indian territory. I was careful to add that the opinion 1 was giving w r as only a personal one and was not to be considered as applying to anyone else but myself. The interview then ended. I am afraid these Russian gentlemen are disappointed at the little encouragement they have received here. Believe me, &amp;c., Fred. Huth Jackson. Annex 5. Foreign Office to Messrs. Baring Brothers.

After a close investigation based on data including materials of the Ministries concerned the Russian committee have come to the conclusion— That the trunk line through Persia must be constructed by a single international ompany, m which the Russian and English interests shall predominate, and m which interests other than English or Russian may or may not be admitted according to agreement with the British Government and with the English committee, which should later be formed ; That it is an indispensable condition for the commercial success of the railway, that the line through Persia should be as short and straight as possible, m order to enable it to compete both with other existing means of transit and possible future lines. With this object in view the committee have decided on a route to pass from Baku through Astara, Tehran, and Kerman to Nushki. But it is clearly understood that if, from the British point of view, Nushki be found unsuitable as the point of junction with the Indian railway system, and if Kurrachee be recommended instead, the alteration could be adopted without affecting the commercial success of the line, providing, however, that the section between Kerman and Kurrachee should run as^ far as^ is practicable in a due south-easterly direction without any unnecessary deviations which would lengthen the line as a whole. The Russian committee have also studied the financial prospects of such a line, have made a rough estimate of the cost of construction, and have examined the possible effect of such a line on the increase of profits for the Russian railway system. The conclusions at which the committee have arrived in this respect are embodied Enclosure in No. 1. Sir, M. Homiakoif to Sir A. Nicolson. July 17, 1911.

Having secured the approval of the .Russian Government, the Russian committee have at the same time interested all the leading Russian banks, and they (the banks) have subscribed a capital of 300,000 roubles for further preliminary investigation. The Russian committee have now concluded the first part of the task and have come to the conclusion, that the moment has arrived when a “ societe d’etudes” should be formed including the representatives of at least the two most concerned nations outside Persia, i.e., England and Russia. With this object in view, the Russian committee have deputed the undersigned to come to London and to approach both the British Government and the financiers of London in order to form jointly such a “ societe d’etudes ” for further preliminary investigation, for negotiations with the Persian Government to obtain the necessary concessions and also for the final formation of the company for the construction of the railway. As mentioned above, we have approached the leading financial houses and also some leading public men of England who stand for a closer relationship between the two countries, and we are glad to state that we have found them most favourably disposed towards the realisation of our object. But it has been pointed out to us that before any detinite steps towards the formation of a “societe d’etudes” could be undertaken, two points of importance should be settled: firstly, the question of the final alignment of the section between Kerman and Kurrachee; and. secondly, whether the Britis h Gover nment or the Government of India would to any extent be prepared - to suppoic the--'promoters on the English side in the same way as the Russian Government and the Russian banks aie prepared to support the Russian promoters &gt;f Gw f-cheme Our friends here have pointed out to us that whereas we in Russia have already collected 300,000 roubles for our share of the preliminary expenses (which sum includes further preliminary investigation, technical survey, and the expenses for the formation of the company, and whereas we can reckon on some support from the Russian Government, as pointed out in our printed report, they are unable as yet to gauge the extent of support which the British Government or the Government of India would be prepared to give them in case they decided to collaborate with us. This being the position at the moment, the undersigned are of opinion that at this stage the co-operation of the British Government is highly desirable, and we beg to submit the matter to your consideration.

BARK, Managing Director of the Volga Kama Commercial Bank, and M. A. 0.' Goukassow asked me to give them another interview, and I have seen them this afternoon. They told me that they had seen Lord Revelstoke, and had also sent yon a memorandum upon the Persian Railway scheme at your request. They particularly wished to have my views as to the possibility of forming a London group prepared to join with Russian and French groups in examining the whole project, and sharing in the cost of this examination—which is estimated at 120,000L In my reply I began by reminding them of what 1 had said on a previous occasion—and what I believe that you had also told them—that I was not a financier, and that, therefore, neither I nor my firm would participate in the scheme. They replied that they fully understood this. I then went on to say that, looking at the matter as a business proposition, it would in my opinion be impossible to form any such financial group in London as was suggested, unless— 1. The actual route for the railway had been approved both by the Russian and the British and Indian Governments—which was I understood at present not the case. 2. Unless there were satisfactory and sufficient guarantees forthcoming, which would enable the necessary funds to build the railway to be raised later on. They then asked me whether I thought the British or Indian Governments would be willing to give any guarantees. I replied that I thought it extremely unlikely that the British Government would, under any circumstances, give a guarantee ; while, even if the Indian Government were to entertain the idea, they would be sure to limit their guarantee to capital spent on that portion of the railway which passed through Indian territory. I was careful to add that the opinion I was giving was only a personal one, and was not to be considered as applying to anyone else but myself. The interview then ended. I am afraid these Russian gentlemen are disappointed at the little encouragement they have received here. EASTERN DEPARTMENT. [July 19.] SECRET SERIES. Section 3. [28359] No. 1.

[1969 ««—2]A staff of engineers and experts has actually finished its work under supervision of M. Petchkovsky, chairman of the Rostoff-Vladicaucase Railway and member of the group. It is our aim, leaving aside all the details and the calculations, to expose only the net results of these fore-studies, which, we believe, are able to present the whole plan under an entirely new light. It is generally considered as an obvious fact that a- * railway line in Persia can be built only under a direct Government guarantee. The aforesaid preliminary studies enable us to state that this point of view appears not quite correct when applied to a railway establishing a direct and uninterrupted overland communication between Europe and India, and to corroborate our statement by the following data :— 1. Preliminary Forecast .—The length of the railway across Persia will not surpass 1,400 miles, out of which 140 miles have been added in order to avoid the deserts of Dechet and Lut. The building expenditure is calculated at 18,700,000Z., the rolling- stock included. (The Russian group possesses surveys made in 1900 by Russian engineers for a large part of the line from the Russian frontier up to Kerman.) This preliminary forecast has been made as broadly as possible within reasonable limits. English experts have expressed the belief that the expenditure would not surpass 15,000,000Z. The possible receipts of the railway can be obtained from the following sources :— (a.) Passengers and valuable goods going from Europe to India or vice £ versa. This paragraph contains also postal communications. Very valuable goods only (over 400Z. the ton) are taken into consideration, on a very moderate scale. Through goods from Europe to Persia are quite left aside. . .. .. .. .. 1,422,000 {b.')

Indirect Guarantees . A source of indirect guarantee can be extracted from the surpms revenus gained by the Russian and Indian railway nets after the opening of the | ^ irec ^ ^ r ^ ns ' con fi n e n fal communications. These revenues are valued at 460,0()0Z. for the - 2 * * S ^' uss ^ an railways, which will enter into the through line from Europe to India. I he Russian Government, being opposed to a direct guarantee, which may impose a certain burden on the Exchequer, has admitted, on the contrary, the possibility of assuring the interests of the share and bondholders of the new railway out of that sum, which is an ^ unforeseen receipt, obtained thanks to the new through traffic. The same reasoning may be applied to the 1,400 miles (up to Bombay) or miles (up to { Rayutta) m India and British Beluchistan, the whole sum exceeding the 709,000?., which the Persian line itself will be able to give to satisfy the said interests. There is no doubt possible that a sum of 1,200,000?. per annum would be amply sufficient for that object, out of which only 500,000?. have to be provided in the aforesaid manner or m any other way, which can be suggested by the future “ societe d’etudes.” There is no doubt possible as to the probable development of Persia owing to the railway, w ich may be combined with useful branch lines. One can also feel secure that, as every new highway of communication and of civilisation, the Indo-European trunk line wi ^ create an exchange, of people and. of goods, which it is impossible to foretell. The mam thing is that, having vast possibilities, the projected railway is based on tangible rea ities, whereas many railways in Africa, America, or elsewhere have been built with only a reasonable hope for a more or less distant future. Though these preliminary calculations have been made m a prudent manner and are based exclusively on official statisuics and established facts, the Russian group believe that further investigations must be begun on a large scale by a special company or syndicate (“ societe d’etudes”), lhat syndicate will have to prepare the ground in all respects for the railway company, to obtain the concession from the Persian Government, and to negotiate all necessary arrangements with the States interested in the through traffic. Russian banks and .railway companies have already subscribed a considerable sum for that object, and we may safely assume that at the present time we have obtained all that could be done3 ; »'S. p^ti, bed 1 ^! iHde Id ^ure loij^ ’^bed from Iff;.. iiiorricf f M ?erj Aratioii, s to Persia •• ;• ^ aiortia •• ..

The communication from the Russian promoters appears to add nothing to the information conveyed in Sir G. Buchanan’s Despatch No.. 29 of 31st January last, except the fact that they seem to think themselves justified by the attitude of the Russian Government in proceeding with the scheme. That attitude is described by the Russian Government themselves as follows “ The council was generally favourable to the proposal brought forward by the promoters of the enterprise that a special commission (‘ societe d’etudes ’) should be instituted for a preliminary study of the question, on the understanding, however, that the realisation of the scheme shall not involve loss to the Russian Treasury or damage the economic interests of Russia. “ The decision of the Council of Ministers on this subject will take final shape as soon as the Ministries interested have arrived at an agreement.” 3, And it has been added in conversation that the only financial support that the enterprise would receive from the Russian Government would be a certain share in any surplus profits that might accrue to the State railways from increased receipts due to the transit traffic in goods and passengers through Russia. Sir E. Grey expresses the hope that it may be possible for His Majesty’s Government to adopt an attitude towards the scheme not less favourable than that of the Russian Government. It will be seen from the Government of India’s letter and the papers enclosed therein that from the point of view of through traffic, whether of goods or passengers, a Trans-Persian railway such as that proposed is thought to have no prospects of financial success, and, furth er, that India can_ hope to derive from the development of local traffic no commercial advantage at all commensurate with that which Russia may expect. If this view is sound—and I am to say that Viscount Morley concurs generally in it —the question arises Why should India sacrifice all the strategical advan tages of her geographical isolation in order to encourage a scheme which, whatever prospect of profit it may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to herself ? An indirect answer may perhaps be given to this question. It may be pointed out that with the advent of other Powers in Persia, seeking spheres of commercial if not of political expansion, the geographical isolation of India, is necessarily doomed, and that it behoves those who are responsible for her interests to be foremost in the race for concessions, so as to ensure that such at least as may be strategically and politically essential to her security shall be in her own hands. One or more of these concessions would be for railway lines which, though their immediate purpose would be different, might, without disadvantage, form connecting links in a Trans-Persian railway. (\Lord Morley thinks that this is, on the whole, a reasonable answer. But certain corollaries appear to follow from it:— (1.) Whatever the alignment of the rest of the line, it is essential that f that part of it which will be in the British sphere shall be determined solely with a view to Indian interests. The line must therefore, in Lord Morley’s opinion, enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas, and not at Kerman, and run along the coast to Karachi; and there must be a break of gauge at Bunder Abbas. f /cf. S. 62.(2.) While the through line may be international as regards the financial interests admitted (and in this connection I am to observe that it will be neither possible nor desirable to exclude German capital), it is essential that the actual construction and working of the section ^ in the British sphere should be entirely in British hands; but there would be no objection to placing abroad contracts for a certain proportion of the materials and roiling stock. (3.) ft is practically certain that British capitalists will not entertain the scheme unless there is a Government guarantee in some form or another. And this raises a very important and difficult question of principle. Before dealing with that I am to observe, on a point of detail, that the proposed Russian guarantee appears to be illusory. It is true that in Sir E. Grey’s Despatch^ No. 78, to Sir G. Buchanan, dated 14th March, Count Benckendorff is reported to estimate the profit on increased traffic on Russian railways at 4,500,000 roubles (about 475,000Z.) a year. Lord Morley is unable to conjecture upon what data this estimate is based ; but it is obvious that if the view taken above be correct, and the through traffic be not likely to pay, the increase of traffic in Russia itself must be of modest dimensions; and, if the Government of India’s Committee are correct in thinking that the Consortium have enormously over estimated the gross earnings of the through line, the Russian Government’s “guarantee fund ” will manifestly be inadequate. But whatever view Russian financiers maydake of it, British financiers are likely to require from their own Government some more substantial consideration. Lord Morley is not aware what are Sir E. Grey’s views upon this subject, but it will be seen that the Government of India recommend that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain should be equally shared between the Indian and British exchequers^ SC-This recommendation will call for serious consideration in view of the heavy expenditure already borne by India in providing for the defence of her frontiers. If those frontiers are made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway extension, which Imperial policy and the attitude of His Majesty s Government towards the European Powers force upon the acceptance of India, her claims upon the Imperial Exchequer will be strong. But at present the railway project is only under examination, and it is reasonable to defer a decision in regard to the guarantee until the conclusions of the experts have been received. &lt;$'Subject to these remarks his Lordship agrees with the Government of India, and would suggest that the assent of His Majesty’s Government should be given to the scheme in principle, and that application should be made for the concessions for blocking purposes, as soon as the situation in Persia permits. The project can then be examined in detail by an expert body similar to the Russian societe d’etades. U.l am to add that Lord Morley is of opinion that it will not survive such an examination. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.rs • ^ 5&gt;o5 FOREIGN OFFICE, Confidential.

I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant,( Copy ) 3^o3&gt; 25 Feb, 1911. 10 Mar. 1911 Dear Sir, The last time we were in London at our meeting with you on the 2nd of December we agreed to inform each other of the progress in the transactions, relating to the transpersian railway up to tjrme, when, after we had positive indications that both Governments as well as that of India were not hostile to the project, a new meeting would be found opportune. consortium, parallel to studying the details and available statistical data of the question, inquired of the Russian Cabinet what would be its attitude towards the project. official answer of our Government that took some little time to be forthcoming. Though the press had circulated it some weeks ago, our Chairman Engineer Bunge received the document signed by the Clerk of the Cabinet but very much later. In pursuance of that object the Russian At present we are able to inform you of the That2 That gentleman, acting hy order of the Prime Minister, informs Mr. Bunge that the Cabinet is sympathetic to the idea of establishing a railway communication from Western Europe to India through Russia and Persia and that it has nothing against the formation of a Soci6t6 d'Etudes for that purpose; but that it must indicate that the execution of the project must conform itself to the economical interests of the Empire and not be prejudicial to the interests of the Exchequer. Such is the attitude of the Cabinet as re- -gards the question in its substance; as to the details they will have to be the object of a special deliber- -ation after the Soci6t6 d’Etudes shall have submitted the result of its investigations. In its very cautious answer the Cabinet has taken into consideration a hostile current to the project that manifested itself in certain Moscovite circles which tried to prove that the opening up of Persia to railway enterprises would oblige the Russian Government to admit the transit of goods thereto which in its turn would completely oust Russian trade in manufactured goods out of Persia. That opinion is not generallynreceived in Moscow. For instance, M.'*Gooteh- .-coffM. Gootchcoff, the Lord Llayor of Moscow, and his brother M. A, Gootchcoff, the Speaker of the Douma, sympathise with the project. In view of the Moscovite objections the Cabinet instructed the President of the Board of Trade to call a meeting on the purpose of investigating, to what extent the .Russian commercial interests might be impaired by the construction of rail- -ways in Persia, and of finding out the best eventual compensations. The meeting took place in January and the results were reported to the Cabinet by M. Timasheff. The Cabinet, after mature deliberation of this report, pronounced itself, as above mentioned, favourable to the project. It is perfectly evident that in its official answer, addressed to the promoters of the enterprise, the Cabinet could not give more substantial promises and had to put back all details to the time when a Soci6t6 d*Etudes would be able to submit a scheme, developed on sound bases. But in conversations with Messrs. Bunge and Petchcovsky the Minister of Finance admitted that he saw no drawbacks to alloting the surplus of income on the Russian railway net coming from transit goods and travellers over the RussianRussian railway system to and from India to a special fund that might serve as a guarantee to the debentures of the new line.

[9841] Sir Edward (Ireij to Sir G. Buchanan. (No. 78.) Sir, Foreign Office, March 14, 1911. COUNT BENCKENDORFE reminded me to-day that the Russian Government had expressed sympathy with the Trans-Persian railway proposal, and had said that they could not express a more definite opinion before having a project put before them by a “ Comite d’Etudes,” and Count Benckendorff pressed me as to whether the British Government could not say something sympathetic. I asked whether the “Comite d’Etudes ” would expect a guarantee. Count Benckendorif replied that the idea was that the Russian Government should promise them the profit on the transit through Russia of all goods for the Trans- Persian railway. This railway would bring increased traffic to the Russian lines in Russia, and the profit on this increase would amount to about 4,500,000 roubles a-year. ^ ! This was something to begin with. - I observed that, since M. Sazonow had been so positive that no guarantee could be given by the Russian Government for any Persian railway, I had assumed that the project could not make much progress. But, nevertheless, we had lost no time in communicating with the Government of India. I would now look into what had passed, and let him have a reply. He reminded me that the Emperor took great interest in the question. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. [March 14.] * \ Section 5. No. ! [1932 o—5] / 2 .'O'lMIW' II BWH I 'H nr— II '■■‘TTIgW CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G.

The only course that I can suggest is that I should discuss matter with Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs when he is sufficiently recovered from his present illness. He may, however, be incapacitated some time, and there is no one else at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to whom I can speak to any purpose. We should, I think, point out that we require this line in order to maintain our economic interests in the regions which it will tap, as they would otherwise be seriously handicapped when once Grerman goods obtain easy access to those legions by means of the branch line to be constructed from Bagdad Railway to North Persia. Foreign competition will then become inevitable, and Russia ought to realise that we must place ourselves on an equality with Germany, even though projected line may some what prejudice Russian trade. We might perhaps invite Russia to associate herself m the undertaking by building northern section from Julfa and render this easier foi hei by offering financial assistance, but the question of rates will probably present difficulty.

The Right Hon’blb the E VTtL op CREWE, K.G., His Majesty's Secretary of State for Indio* Fort William, the 23rd February 1911. I Enclosure No. 6. My Lord, Wc have the honour to refer to Lord Morley’s Secret despatch No. 32, dated the 4th November 1910, and subsequent telegraphic correspond ence on the subject of the scheme proposed by the Russian Consortium for the connection of the European and Indian railway systems by the construction of a line from Baku to Nushki via Tehran, Kum, Kashan, Yezd and Kerman. 2. As will be seen from the enclosed papers, the question of the attitude which India should assume towards the scheme has been fully discussed both departmentally and in consultation with our local advisers. In view of the diversity of opinion displayed in the preliminary discussion, we thought it advisable to appoint a representative inter-departmental Committee to examine and consider the question in all its bearings and to advise as to the terms of the reply to be sent to your predecessor’s despatch. The conclusions of this Committee, as will be seen from their report,* are that the Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposal of the Russian Consortium, subject to the following modifications and conditions: — (a) that the point of junction of the main through route with the Indian railway system be at Karachi, and not at Nushki; (i) that the route from Yezd to Karachi be vid Bandar Abbas and thence along the sea coast, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey; (&lt;?) that concessions be obtained for branch lines— (i) from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan, Bam and Kerman; (ii) from Mohammerah to Hamadan ; (iii) from Mohammerah to Bandar xlbbas vid Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz; (iv) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan ; (d) that both the main and the branch lines in Persian territory be international, Russia and Great Britain holding a preponder ating share and Persia being admitted to participate ;(e) that the pau^e of the line passing through British territory and the British zone be different from that of the line m the Russian zone, and that tho break of gauge be at Bandar Abbas on the limit of the British zone; ^ ^ (f \ that, in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia , should pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming “I to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Perso-Aighan border within the Russian or neutral zones. 3 We concur generally in these conclusions, except in regaid to a few noints as to which we find ourselves unable to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. The first point relates to the proposed internauonahsatipn of the branch lines. We agree that it will be desirable to internationalise any branch lines that may be constructed in the neutral zone. But we see no necessity for treating as international any branch lines winch Russia or Great Britain may decide to construct in their respective zones. We would propose, therefore, to treat the proposed branch line from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Kerman as a purely British project and to keep this question out of the negotiations with Russia, except in so lar as her support may be necessary to enable us to secure a concession from the Persian Government. 4. Secondly, we do not endorse the proposal for a branch line from Bush ire to Shiraz and Ispahan. Such a lino would be a most difficult and most costly undeitaking, and would at the same time be quite unnecessary either as a commercial project or as a bar to German enterprise, since the construction of a line from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz and Mohammerah would cause all the trade to pass through Bandar Abbas and Mohammerah and Bushire would entirely lose its importance as a port. Bandar Abbas could, we believe, be converted into a good port, while Bushire can never be a good port, since all the big ships have to lie out at a distance of five or six miles from the shore. Consequently, Bushire must in the end disappear as a trade centre and a railway to Shiraz would be useless. Whether Shiraz should he connected with Ispahan or not is another matter. If the Trans-Persian line passes through Ispahan, as proposed by the Consortium, a branch to Shiraz would be advantageous from the Russian point of view, since it would provide railway communication with Shiraz which Russian trade wmuld not otherwise have. In that case, we think that it would he desirable to make no mention of a branch from Shiraz to Ispahan at present. If, on the other hand, the Trans-Persian line is to avoid Ispahan, as proposed by the Russian Government, it w r ould be greatly to our advantage to have a connection with Ispahan, since our trade would be able to pour in from Bandar Abbas via Shiraz. We think, therefore, that it w'ould he better to take no action in regard to this branch line until it is known more certainly whether the Trans-Persian line is to pass through Ispahan or not. 5. Thirdly, we disagree with the Committee as to the necessity for pro ceeding with the construction of the Mohammerah-Hamadan line simul taneously with the construction of the main line. Such a branch w ould be useless for practical purposes, since it would have to compete with the Baghdad-Khanikin line and the Trans-Persian Railway. A line from Julfa to Mohammerah would have been useful as a counterpoise to the Baghdad Railway in the absence of the more comprehensive scheme now proposed, but it has quite lost its value now that the Trans-Persian Railway is to be the counterpoise. We think, therefore, that the Mohammerah-Hamadau concession should be obtained merely for the purpose of ear-marking, as against any attempt to connect the Baghdad Railway extension with the Gulf by this route. 6. Pinally, w’e are not persuaded, on the information contained in the Committee’s report, that the practical difficulties of the alignment proposed by Colonel Cox (namely, from Yezd to Karachi via Kerman, Bam, Regan, Bampur, Sarbaz and Kej) are so serious as to make it necessary to adopt the more circuitous route via Bandar Abbas, and w e have some doubt whether the latter - route would prove acceptable to the Russian Government. We would prefertherefore to reserve our opinion as to the respective merits of the Yezd- Bandar Abbas-Karachi and Yezd-Kerman-Karachi alignments until these two routes have been examined locally by a railway engineer. 7. With these reservations, we commend the Committee’s proposals to the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government and have only to add that, in our opinion, it is very desirable, if the Trans-Persian Railway is to be made at all, that it should be commenced as soon as possible, so that it may be completed some time before the Baghdad Railway. The line will then have line that is first completed. 8. We have made no suggestions as to the financing of the proposed line, as this is a matter which His Majesty’s Government will probably wish to reserve for discussion in England. But we endorse the recommendation of the Committee that any financial responsibility undertaken by Great Britain in connection with the project should be shared equally between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers. acquired a certain amount of trade and traffic that would naturally fall to the We have the honour to be.

Proposed linking up of Eussian and Indian railway systems by a line through Persia. As I understand the position, we must now assume complete good faith on the part of Eussia under the Convention and abandonment of former designs on India. We cannot, therefore, take our stand on fundamental objec tions of Indian strategists against connection of Indian and Eussian railway systems. If above premise is conceded, it seems lo me that an attitude of mere benevolent neutrality will hardly suffice and might be dangerous, and that, having exercised right, which the promoters concede to us, of constructing the line from Kerman southwards, we should support the present proposal to the extent of co-operating in the thorough examination of project from business and engineering points of view. But although the bogey of Eussian designs on India is laid for the present generation, we cannot advisedly ignore the strategical aspect of the connection via Seistan altogether, and in this connection I cannot understand the dictum in letter from India Office to Foreign Office, dated 23rd December 1909, to the effect that the strategical objections are equally insuperable, whether the line proceeds from Kerman via Nushki or across Mekran and thence near the coast to Hyderabad. I submit that an alignment from Kerman via Bam, Eigan, Bampur, Serbaz, thence across the frontier near Kej, and so on to Karachi or Hyderabad would be infinitely less open to strategical objection and would also be a much more profitable line of country to tap. If the line actually touched the coast, it would do so in British territory at Gwetter or Pasni, or at Gwadur by arrangement with Maskat. Furthermore, this alignment would provide effective means for checking the arms traffic through Mekran, and for exercising influence with the Baluchistan Chiefs connected therewith. Assuming that we agree to co-operate, there remains the question of keep ing Germany out of the neutral zone, and preventing her from profiting by a junction of the Baghdad Bailway with the Anglo-Eussian through route. Granted the good faith of Eussia as regards designs on India, there is nothing to prevent a pro-German epidemic in Petersburgh from encouraging Germany to undertake active enterprise in the neutral zone and thus weaken our present predominant position therein. This contingency seems conceivably possible at the present time. The above considerations seem to me to make ft essential that we should stipulate with Eussia that as an anterior condition of our co-operation in promoting the through route, she must first join us in obtaining a concession for the Mohammerah-Julfa line and agree to commence the section from Mohammerah to Hamadan immediately she agrees to connect the Khanikin branch of the Baghdad Eailway with the Eussian system via Kermanshah. We should also stipulate that we simultaneously obtain a concession for a branch line in the neutral zone, firstly, from Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Kerman; secondly, from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz; and, thirdly, from Bandar Abbas to join the through line at Bam. The latter connection should be built simultaneously with the main line, while the two former would merely be held for blocking purposes and be taken in hand when occasion demanded. With above safeg uards, and provided that commercial facilities for all be assured throughout the whole railway, I believe that both Indian and English trade would benefit and find new openings equally with Eussian and it cannot hut be supposed that the general effect of the railway would be to improve the administration, develop the country and increase the capacity of the Persian market. The question of passenger traffic depends on amount to which cost and length of journey could be curtailed, but it may be presumed that at equal ratio there would be large increase of native Indian traffic with Europe. Without further study I do not feel able to offer useful views as regards question of division of management and control. Foreign Office Press—No. 494—23-12-10—39.(Confidential.)

XT to actnowled g e the receipt of your endorsement No. 2604 E.-A. of 3rd December 1910, in which I am desired to furnish my views on the proposed scheme for the connection of the European and Indian xlailway systems by the construction of a line across Persia. _ 2 * Tb ® complete information regarding the country through which the proposed line is to run ; the absence of reliable data and statistics of its potential possibilities, or even its existing trade requirements, render it impossible to deal with the present problem on the usual lines. Any detailed forecast of the financial results of the line or its general effect on Persia and adioining countries is at present impossible. All that can be done in these circum stances is to treat the subject on broad lines and endeavour to arrive at general conclusions. . ° ^ m P ar ^ a ^ consideration of the subject is moreover hampered at the outset by the fact that we, as a nation, have always been accustomed to insularity , and have so long endeavoured to maintain the insularity of our Indian Empire, by an impassable barrier of buffer States, and that we cannot be expected to accord a welcome to any scheme which threatens to invade our isolation and bring us, as the proposed railway must do, into direct contact bv rail with the outer world. J So strong is the natural tendency to oppose any change from existing conditions, that there is every danger of our failing to recognise in a proposal such as the present one, advantages which would be self-apparent to other European nations or even our own Canadian Dominion, to whom intercommu nication by railway with adjoining countries is an accepted condition of ordinary In our effort to consider the problem without undue bias we must, however endeavour, when steering wide of the Scylla of unreasonable opposition, not to shipwreck on the Charybdis of blind acceptance. 4. However anxious we may rightly be not to expedite a new order of things, we must admit the futility of expecting that the present want of com munications with, and in Persia, can much longer prevent access to the world’s trade, or form a barrier to European nations in their rivalry for new and larger markets. No less necessary is it to recognise the risk that, if we decline the opportunity now afforded, of a joint arrangement with Russia, to open up Persia by railway to the advantange of our mutual trade, Russia may be compelled, by the necessities of the new situation created by the coming Baghdad Railway, to make joint railway arrangements with some other Power in which our advan tages and requirements would be ignored. We should doubtless in the end be2 comnelled to face the very evils we now wish to avoid, and connect our Indian Xtaihvay system with one which might not receive us m an amicable spirit or on favourable terms. It is obviously essential to recognise the above contingency, before proceed in'’ to consider the present proposal, because arguments of a political, oom- mlrciaf and military naturefwhich may now be urged against its adoption, may ^ no less cogent at the moment when necessity hereafter compels us to stultify ourselves by ignoring them. 5 It is proposed to connect the Russian and Indian Railway systems by a line from Baku through Persia to India. The line will probably leave the coast F Onsnian near Enzeli, some 250 miles east of Baku, and pass through or near^Tehran^Rpahan, Yezd! and Kerman. Prom Baku to the Indian border of Persia, the line will he about 1,100 miles m length. 6 Prom the commercial point of view it is obvious that the line will benefit Russian trade to an enormous and preponderating extent. As stated by the authors “ all the freights of the Volga will get a considerable advantage over W? 2 n 'mods over a great part of Persia.” The force of this statement is the more S seff-evident, if S 0 ne remembers that goods from the Caspian httoral and the Volga need not take to the railway at Baku, but can be water borne as far as Enzeli, thus further diminishing the rail journey by over 200 miles. It will be difficult for British goods to compete in these circumstances with similar Russian goods in any part of interior Persia. To give British Trade any fair chance of competing at all, it will be necessary to construct branch Hnes northwards to meet the central line from the coast. That from Bandar Abbas to Kirman appears the one to be built first, as being within our own sphere and therefore to be under our sole control. Others from Ahwaz to Ispahan and Bushire through Shiraz will doubtless follow in due course. 7 It is not only in Persia itself, however, that the line will benefit Russian trade, for it will open out to it many fields of commercial enterprise in India. The following table of comparative distances of a few places selected at random will suffice to illustrate this : Baku to Quetta ... ••• Baku to the Indo-Persian frontier Enzeli to Quetta ... ... Enzeli to the Indo-Persian frontier ... 1,500 miles. ... 1,100 „ ... 1,300 „ ... S00 „ Calcutta to Quetta ...

The same table, however, serves to illustrate the advantage which will accrue to Indian trade from the proposed line, and it may be confidently expected that a very great impulse will he given thereby to Indian trade throughout Persia. The distance by rail from Delhi to Yezd, it will be observed, is but little more than from Bombay or Calcutta to Peshawar or Quetta. 9 'We have as yet only considered the Persian railway from the aspect as^a trade carrier, and it is now necessary to consider it in its more importantaspect of a trade producer. In an isolated and undeveloped country, such as Persia, the introduction of a railway line cannot fail to have most important and far-reaching effects on trade. It must inevitably, as has been the case in every country in the world, lead to the development of agriculture and other natural resources, and nowhere perhaps do greater possibilities or room for such development exist than in Persia. There are vast tracts of good land everywhere lying unused and only needing the small capital necessary for reopening the old Karezes by which they used to he irrigated. Nearer India, it will pass close to the existing fertile tract of Seistan, whose wealth of surplus products will at last find a market. This must automatically lead to the rapid development of that rich country and further swell the volume of local trade. Next will follow in the natural course of events the exploration and develop ment of the mineral resources of the country, which are known to exist, but which, through want of transport facilities, have hitherto not been considered worth investigating. Last but not least, the existing local products of Persia, such as ghee, hides and grain, wool, &amp;c., which either absence or cost of transport have made it impossible or unprofitable to export, will become available for export and thus will be removed what is now the principal impediment to Persian trade deve lopment, i.e., the dearth of exports for the payment of imports. These are great and solid advantages which will benefit British, Russian and Indian trade alike. They should go far to compensate, through increased bulk, British and Indian trade for the more favoured position which the new line will give to Russian trade in its competition with ours. 10. It will, however, be imperatively necessary, in order to prevent Russia deriving more than its proper share of these and other trade advantages, to take steps to ensure British and Indian trade obtaining an equal start as regards time. Unless strenuous steps are taken Russian trade will be able to make use of the new line before we can do so, and it will be difficult for us to make up for lost time. The line should therefore be commenced simultaneously from both ends. Russia can commence the railway at her own door, whereas we have yet to traverse a wide stretch of country to reach the Persian frontier. It is there fore essential to extend our Indian Railway system to Persia by the shortest and easiest route and to do so in the least possible time. The only route which meets these requirements is that to Nushki. Military and commercial reasons will ultimately necessitate a line from Karachi, but it will be unwise to use that route in the first instance. From the valuable* railway reconnaissance made by Mr. Johns in 1903, it will be seen that a line from Nushki to the Persian border, 360 miles in length, admits of very easy and rapid construction. It is estimated that it could be built within two years at accost of *198 lakhs, whereas the line from Karachi (through Kondi) to the same point on the Persian border would traverse a country presenting very serious engineering difficulties ; it would be over 700 miles in length, cost * 750 lakhs and take some 8 years to construct. The value of the Karachi line to sea-borne British trade would moreover be greatly minimized by the line from Bandar Abbas or other Gulf seaport northwards. Not only therefore should the Nushki-Robat line be pushed forward with the greatest possible speed, without waiting for the commencement of the line from Baku, but work on the line from Bandar Abbas northwards, and, as far as possible, from the Indo-Persian border westwards, should be begun simultaneously with the commencement of the Russian ends of the main Persian line. * These figures are only approximate and apply to a railway line of 62 lb. rails. They are valuable as indication f relative cost, and it should be remembered that the cost of the Karachi line, from the nature of the country to be traversed, is more likely to exceed the present rough estimate than the easy JSushki line. The 750 lakhs of the Karachi line are arrived at by taking Mr. Johns’ estimate of 668 lakhs for the line Karachi to Kondi and adding 82 lakhs for the portion onwards to the fersian border, at or near Robat, at the average cost per jnile 0 f the Robat-Nushki estimate. A. H. MoMahoo.To facilitate action when the time comes, it would appear advisable to start railway surveys from Nushki, Hobat and Bandar Abbas with the least possible delay. 11. Of the financial success of the line itself I do not think that there is any reason to be sceptical. Whatever the discomfort of the long rail journey compared to that by sea to Europe from the East may be, it is but reasonable to expect that the majority of travellers will be tempted to use the former route, either from motives of economy or from desire to traverse the countries through which the line will run. This will apply not only to travellers to and from India but to those between Australia and China. The number of through passengers on which the estimate of income is based may appear large at first sight, but I do not think that it is unduly so. On the other hand, I am inclined to think that the receipts from local passengers have been under rather than over estimated. The amount of local traffic which a railway creates even in the most unpromising areas is often surprising. As an instance of this I may quote the line from Quetta to Nushki. When the construction of the line was under consideration the prospect of a remuner ative local traffic was hardly thought worthy of being taken into account owing to the seemingly uninhabited area it traversed. Nevertheless, the amount of local traffic has been such as to convert what was feared would he an unremunerative strategic line into a commercially profitable one. Similarly, there is considerable reason to suppose that the line onward will, in Persia, develop a local traffic of a more extensive and lucrative nature than that now estimated for. Incidentally the through traffic on the proposed line will tend to increase the receipts of the Indian systems to a very considerable extent, by attracting many passengers through India who would otherwise travel by sea without setting foot in this country. It is necessary to give due credit to this factor, and also to the additional income from the carriage of the increased bulk of Indo-Persian goods on Indian lines, when considering the question of guarantees to the new undertaking. 12. It is necessary next to regard the proposal from the political and mili tary point of view. This can best be done together, as the difficulty of separat ing political from military considerations is very considerable, and for this reason only do I venture to trespass on military ground. We are now brought face to face with new problems, and strong though the. inclination may be to avoid their consideration by opposing the proposal ab initio, it is necessary to tackle them seriously and impartially. In the first place, the proposed railway line through Persia involves the necessity of ensuring its safety throughout its length. It is unreasonable to expect a lucrative passenger or goods traffic, if the line has to run, in turn, the gauntlet of Bakhtiari brigands or disappointed and exasperated Afghan gun runners. It will have to be safeguarded from both. The existence of the line will itself facilitate measures for dealing with troubles of this nature, but the real difficulty which the protection of the lino involves is one common to several other questions connected with its construc tion and maintenance, i.e., its relation to the future of the Persian Government. In this case the adequate protection of the line affects the future not only of a railway but of a^ nation. On the ability of the Persian Government to meet its responsibilities in regard to the line depends the consolidation or dis integration of Persian autonomy. On this again depends the effect of the line on the military and political problems of India. n ■^ e ? c ^ es ® that any support we give to the present proposal should be based on the determination to prevent its adoption leading to the disinte gration of Persia, and all our efforts should be directed towards making the line a means of strengthening the authority of the Persian Government. 13. Assuming that we enter into the project only on the above under standing, we can now consider the more important problem, i.e .;— • t w hl the existence of the proposed line have on our position m India r Given assurance of perpetual continuance of amicable relationswith Russia, the question hardly needs reply. We must, however, consider also the possible future contingency of hostility with Russia. A railway line lead ing from an enemy’s country, distant though that may be, undoubtedly intro duces sources of danger to which we are unaccustomed. As indicated 'in the previous remarks, the extent of the danger largely depends on the previous effect of the line on the autonomy of Persia. The proposed line moreover introduces a new factor into the problem; for Germany will have doubtless acquired access to this same line from Baghdad. It is possible to conceive conditions under which the new element might add an additional source of danger to ourselves from the new line, but it is, I think, more reasonable to suppose that it will greatly minimise future danger, because the antagonism of German and Turkish interests with those of Russia is likely both to avert hostility between Russia and ourselves, and, in the event of hostilities, to render the Persian line of less assistance and value to Russia than it might otherwise be. In the event of a combination of Russia, Germany, and Turkey against us, it would be hard to overestimate the menace which the Persian line presents to us, but at this stage it would seem superfluous to com plicate the problems of the proposed line with those of Armageddon, and it should suffice to continue to deal with this question on more familiar lines. 14. It may be assumed that we will have constructed at least one branch line from the Persian coast to meet the central line and this fact, in conjunc tion with the long length of the line from Baku or Enzeli, will deprive it of many attractions to Russia for military purposes against India. Again, and this is a still more important ^ factor, the same line nearer India will have converted an important strategic point from being a grave source of dancer into a place of great advantage to ourselves. I refer to Seistan. As long as^ Seistan is left as it is now, cqui-distant from the nearest Russian and British garrisons, it must ever remain an attractive objective and a source of temptation to Russia, and a danger to ourselves. The con struction of the proposed railway line will bring us within such easy reach of it as to destroy all Russian hopes of its easy acquisition. Being no longer in the line of least resistance, it will lose its attractions to Russia and its danger to ourselves. 0 On the other hand, Seistan, with its important strategic position with regard to Persia and the Helmand, would be at our disposal, audits great local resources would enable us to place there, when necessity arises, a force sufficiently larms to render access to India by rail both difficult and dangerous. Prom a military-political point of view therefore, the proposed railway line does not seem an unmixed evil or one which should be avoided on military grounds at the expense of other important considerations. J 15. Afghanistan has so far been omitted from these remarks, but a word is necessary on the Afghan aspect of the question. The line will affect Afghanistan only from the military aspect and in proportion to the menace it represents to that country from Russia. We cannot expect Afghanistan to be pleased with railway or any other arrangements we may jointly make with Russia, as suspicion of Russia must tend to give them a significance hostile to Afghanistan. Apart from this, there is but little in the proposed project which will alarm the Afghan Government. The desirability of our improving communications in order to co-operate in the defence of VVestern Afghanistan has already been clearly recognised by them. The position of the proposed line with regard to Seistan and thereby to the Herat-Kandahar route will, 1 consider, outweigh in the official Afghan mind any additional menace from Russia through Southern Persia. 16. Of the numerous minor difficulties which the present proposal will bring to the front, the one which will probably give most trouble is that of guage. Assuming that neither Russia nor ourselves will allow the other to use their standard guage, it follows that some neutral guage will have to be decided upon. This involves a break of guage at both ends of the Persian line and incidentally increases the difficulty of ffnuing a suitable place for the entry of the line into British territory. J The requirements of a large Railway terminus, establishment, staff &amp;c., in supplies and water are not easily met on the Indo-Persian border]6 and it will probably be found necessary to take the line, even at the cost of distance and time, either to the edge of the Seistan area, or to run a short branch line northwards to that place, to supply the junction where our Eailway systems will meet. 17 i n itig above remarks I have endeavoured to state as impartially as possible the merits and disadvantages of the proposed railway. The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the connection of the European and Indian Eailway systems is inevitable ; that the disadvantages and dangers are not of such a nature as to justify our declining to take this opportunity of entering into the scheme by mutual agreement on amicable and thereby favourable terms, and that therefore we should give the proposal a favourable reception. The time at my disposal has been so short that I am conscious that the above remarks must be considered as a somewhat crude and inadequate treat ment of so important and complex a question. 18. The following is a brief summary of the arguments advanced in this letter and the main conclusions arrived at:— It is unwise to expect that the present isolation of Persia can longer con tinue, or that we can indefinitely maintain freedom for India from intercom munication by rail from the West. The present proposal offers opportunities of a mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and if we decline to take advantage of it, we may be compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway connection under less favourable condi tions. The proposed railway must benefit Eussian trade in much larger propor tion than British trade, but it will benefit Indian trade and largely increase the bulk of both British and Indian trade by the opening up of Persia. . It will increase the receipts of Indian Eailways and thereby benefit Indian revenues. The military or political disadvantages of inter-railway communication are less than might at first sight be supposed, and are largely counteracted by the access afforded by the line to Seistan. These conclusions are arrived at on the assumption that our efforts are directed to preventing the line destroying the autonomy of Persia. '• On the above grounds the proposal merits favourable reception, but in order to minimize the preliminary advantages of Eussia, to assist British trade, prevent Eussia getting an undue start of both British and Indian trade, and for strategic purposes it is absolutely essential;— (1) To construct a line under British control, from Bandar Abbas or other Gulf port to the central line. (2) That the Indian Eailway system be extended to the Indo-Persian border by the easiest and quickest route, i.e., from Nushki. (3) That work on (1) and also from the Indo-Persian border westwards should commence simultaneously with that at the Eussian end. (4) That work on (2) be pushed on with speed without necessarily waiting for the commencement of the Persian line. (5) That a line be constructed in due course from Karachi to meet the central line within British limits. (6) That no time be lost in commencing the necessary railway surveys for all the above lines. Foreign Office Press—No. 448 -24-1-11—74,Enclosure No. 3. (Memorandum by the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence.) The case is sent to me for such concrete facts as might enable the Gov-em inent of India to estimate the probable effect on Indian trade of such a railway as is contemplated. The question put to me is not, as I take it, whether such a railway would help trade (of course it would) or be worth making on other grounds, but whether it would help trade in some sort of proportion to the expenditure. I have therefore thought it incumbent on me to go through all the available information with such speed as has been possible. I may say at once that I have failed to constitute any statistical data that would warrant any such estimate. At the best, any estimate relating to the future is of the nature of conjecture. If I were to set the data out here I should merely waste time and incur some risk of giving rise to conclusions, discussions or hypo theses that are wide of the mark. For if one presents a mass of figures, 'that do not really illustrate the particular point to be considered, there is a danger that-*-qualify them as one may—some of them will stick. Briefly then, our information regarding the volume of trade conducted by India in the direction of Seistan and northwards under present conditions affords no indication whatever of the volume which that trade might ultimately assume in the presence of a railway and under those conditions of civilization that commonly follow a railway. 2. If any weight were to be attached to our returns they must be held to discourage very strongly a project that involves large expenditure and other res ponsibilities. And while it might be argued that the discouraging character of our facts is due in part to unfavourable—and abnormally unfavourable—condi tions not directly related to transportation, we have, on the other hand, been told by our Consuls that some of the progress shown by the trade statistics of this region is to be ascribed to the temporary insecurity cf some other routes. 3. I also think that the Board of Trade view of the value of the railway for trade purposes is much nearer the truth than that of Sir Henry McMahon. In fact I agree generally with the Board of Trade. But then I really have no argument that I could oppose effectively to the local knowledge of Sir Henry McMahon. And I agree with him that, having regard to the conditions under which it almost certainly would be constructed, the railway stands to do a great deal more for Russian than for Indian trade. Indian trade with Persia can be served best by railways from the seaboard. Otherwise we lose the benefit of cheap ocean carriage with its concomitant advantage of the estab lishment at the coast of an entrep6fc that has many of the characteristics of a base in which trade can exercise a good deal of independence and mobility. An entrepdt or base that is half way down a pioneer line of railway is not the same^thing by any^ means. It is always more or less a point “in the air”. And if participation in this inland railway is to divert attention from the littoral lines (and it will be strange if it does net) such pa ticipation will be deplorable. I agree therefore that the immediate construction of a line to the Gulf shou'd by one means or another be assured. How it can be assured is another matter. 4. But if it can be assured, then we may—even while concerning onrselves primarily with trade—look at the new inland project with a wider view than can be obtained through the medium of trade statistics. We know that such concrete facts as are capable of exact measurement do not by themselves furnish an adequate gauge of the probable usefulness of a railway in a raw country. Nor do I think that any one can have watched the course of Persian trade (and politics) for a number of years and have studied the greatly improved reports that are now furnished by our officers in those regior s without noticing that most of the main impediments to progress of all sorts are precisely of the kind that give way before improved communications. It is not merely a matter of improved transportation; for we know that railway rates cannot always bo made competitive with the13 charges for other forms of transport when the commodities to he handled are of comparatively low specitic value or such as do not call loi much expedition in getting' them to their market, lint A tho?e obstacles that consist in dll brigandage, official and unofficial, in the difficulties related to exchange and remittance, in the corruption and inefficiency of the Courts, in the conditions of credit, in the uncertainty as to the identity, the real lesidenee, and the solvency of one’s buyer, in the long delay that occurs between the placing and the execution of an order, and in the impracticability of efficient supnvision and control of the agencies in Persia—to say nothing of the geneial political conditions that affect other things as well as trade, all these obstacles must almost certainly persist until a railway opens the country up. In fact it may be taken that until the country is so opened up the progress of penetration or assimilation cannot really begin and instability must continue. Under present conditions we are more or less shut out j hut Uussia has been able to make better progress than we. Iso doubt the new railway will serve her better than it will us, but it will serve us too, and on the whole it would, I think, create a greater likelihood of our getting even with Russia than can he said to exist at present. Even if it did not better our position relatively to that of Russia, is there any likelihood whatever that its prospect of doing so would he improved by delay ? So far as the “ man in the street” can see there is no such likelihood quite the contrary. It is almost incredible that the more intimate “commerce,” mercantile and social, that would attend the creation of a railway could fail to bring about some sort of assimilation of that part of Persia which is nearest our borders. I should imagine that from a political point of view this would be worth something even if the railway did not pay for a good many years. I should not expect it to pay in the literal sense until the process of assimilation ^ had gone pretty far. Eor Indian trade comprises few commodities of sueli high specific value as would stand cumulative railway freights of a large amount, and I imagine that, in respect of these commodities, most shippers to and from Europe would prefer the greater security of transport by sea over routes that are well policed. Even in my time, the Constantinople Express was held up once or twice in Europe when it was believed that it carried much treasure. As regards trade with Persia it is fairly certain that the risk would be accepted in respect of precious stones and of specie for settlement of debts j for the conditions on our side would be a great deal better than those now present. And it is very probable indeed that the railway would carry northwards substantial quantities of textiles (silk, wool and cotton), sugar, tea, coffee and sundry manufactures of fairly high specific value. Rut I hold that even for these the natural channel would be the Gulf and the railway from the Gulf. The 31st December 1910. E. Noel Paton. Enclosure No. 4i. (Memorandum by the General Staff on the proposed Trans-Tersian Railway.) The General Staff are concerned only with the “probable effect of the Enclosure No. 5 to S'ecretarj of State’s despatch Scheme * * Oil the strategic position of til© No. 32. Indian Empire ”. In considering this strategic aspect of the proposal the General Staff wish to emphasize the fact that any material improvement of land communications towards or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India and of the Empire. When discussing the strategic problem of a possible approach of Russian railways to Afghanistan Mr. Balfour stated : “ if Russian strategic railways are allowed to creep closer and closer to the frontier which we are hound to defend: then this country will inevitably pay for its supineness by having to keep on foot a much larger army than anything which any of us can contemplate with equanimity. Foresight and courage can obviate these dangers, without foresight and courage they may come upon us : and if theydo comp upon ns we shall he throwing upon our children, if not upon our selves, the greatest military problem that has ever confronted the Government of this country.” The figures in Appendix A show the largely increased forces which Russia will he able to develop on the North-West Frontier of India and Afghanistan as soon as the proposed line is completed. 2. It is true that our present friendship with Russia renders improbable any hostile act on her part against India, but that friendship cannot be regarded as permanent. As late as 1909 Major-General Gruloff of the Russian General Staff wrote : “ the struggle between Russia and Britain for political supremacy in Persia has been postponed but not concluded”. It is from this struggle that hostilities may ensue in future. The present entente therefore does not warrant the abandonment of sane and vigilant precautions. It will be seen then that the previous military policy of India has been based upon maintaining its strategic isolation, so that attack becomes, if not impossible, at all events so difficult and lengthy an operation as to involve very great financial strain on the attacking power, and to ensure that before decisive issue is joined, the whole military strength of the British Empire will be available. L 3. While it is the duty of the General Staff to emphasize the great strategic advantage of the natural barriers in the defence of India and tlio consequent disadvantage of piercing this barrier at any point by a railway, s tiH it is fully lealized that a through connection by railway from Europe to India is a development of civilization which cannot be resisted permanently. Iho advocates of the scheme lay stress on choosing an alignment l&lt; for which its importance for transit is its very first consideration, everv thing else being secondary or auxiliary”. At the same time, while safeguarding Russia’s strategic requirements they recognize that some alignments, e.g., the 5 construc tion of a line from Merv to Meshed, “would be strategically rather dangerous for the English”. They evidently therefore anticipate difficulties ou our part, and, assuming that a line will ultimately be constructed, the problem becomes one of rendering it as strategically innocuous to India as possible, by finding some artificial obstacle which will in some measure take the place of the natural barrier which it is proposed to pierce, so that the strain thrown upon the military resources of the Empire in the event of foreign aggression may be neither too sudden nor too severe for them to bear. In the opinion of the General btaif such a substitute can only be found in making use of our preponderating sea power, as a means of control of the proposed line and in adequate fortification, at some distance from the frontier of India, of a naval base through which the proposed line must run. 4. So far in this memorandum the problem has been considered solely from the local point of view of the defence of India from aggression, hut other factors of importance demand attention in connection with this aspect of the case. 5. It has been a cardinal point of onr strategy to retain strategic control of the Persian Gulf. If any sea Power other than Great Britain should obtain preponderance or even a secure base in the Gulf, it is clear that the problem of the defence of Indian ports and the safety of transports bringing reinforce ments from home would be at once made more difficult. A railway passin® close to the littoral and under control of any other Power would afford that Power claims to a port on the Gulf which will be hard to resist. From the possession of a port to the formation of a fortified base will be a natural step. 6. Should Russia adhere “ to her usual policy of cautious absorption” by a gradual occupation of the provinces of Herat and Afghan Turkestan, the highest authorities are of opinion that we should be forced at some period or other to adopt the Kabul-Kand ikar line in our plan of defence, and that action to cause the invader to evacuate Afghanistan would have to be taken elsewhere. Such action will be facilitated, if we can, by the selection of a suitable alignment for this railway and the permanent exclusion of any possible alternative alignment, cause Russia to expose to us a vulnerable point within reach of our sea power.15 7. The approach of the Baghdad Railway to the Gulf gives another factor that requires consideration. If the Power exploiting that line succeeds in obtaining a terminus on the Gulf, the extension of the railway through Southern Persia towards India will probably be pressed. Such an extension under the auspices of a Power potentially hostile to Great B itain will greatly complicate our strategic position. Advantage should be taken of the opportunity now offered of obtaining guarantees that such extension will he under our control. 8. Of minor importance is the consideration that the proposed railway through Persia must break gauge at some point, for the Russian and the Indian systems are on different gauges. This break of gauge will he the weak link in the advance of an enemy along that line. Hence the break of gauge should ho tinder our control and should be as far distant as possible from India. 9. If then the strategic disadvantages of the proposed connection are out weighed by other factors, the General Staff consider that the following condi tions should be fulfilled :— (1) The line should he so located that it can he controlled by our sea power through a large portion of its length. (2) Measures should be included in the schen e which will impose an artificial obstacle to the advance of any hostile power along the line towards India as a substitute for the present natural barriers of mountains and deserts. (3) The complete control of the Gulf should he retained and secured to Great Britain. 0) Advantage should he taken of the opportunity to prevent the possi bility of any third power securing, at some future time, conces sions on or near the Gulf littoral. (5) The break of gauge should he distant from the frontier of India and under the control of Great Britain and within reach of her sea power. (6) No connection between this line and either Afghanistan or Northern Baluchistan should he permitted. (7) The extension of Russian or Persian Railways through Afghanistan should be more strongly resisted than ever. 10. To fulfil the first of these conditions it is essential that the railway line should follow the coast for a considerable portion of its length. 11. To comply with the second, the line must pass through some position Bnitahle for the construction of a fortress of unquestioned strength and offensivo power based on the sea. 12. To meet the third condition Bandar Abbas and TCishm Island must be controlled by Great Britain and garrisoned by British or Indian troops. Further in conformance with the fourth condition the railway concession should stipulate that any branch lines to the Gulf should be made only with the consent of Great Biiiain and under guarantees that the ports will not be fortified by any other Power. 13. The various alignments are considered in detail in Appendix B. It will be seen that the only alignment that offers suitable substitutes for the strategic disadvantage of the abandonment of the present policy of the strategic isolation of India is that via Yezd to Bandar Abbas (direct) and thence along the coast to Karachi. But tins alignment is in itself very far from being a sufficient safeguard. Bandar Abbas must he Jortified and garrisoned permanently by sufficient troops to prevent any attempt to secure it by a coup de main. Within the fortifications should be the break of gauge of the railway. It is by these measures and by these measures alone that we can prevent the construction of a through railway from Europe to India being accompanied by such strategic disadvantages as would demand a very large increase to our military forces both in India and at home. 14. It will be noted that in Appendix B reference is made to a proposal to construct a line from Karacni to ISeistan. The General Staff consider thatSeisstan may become a place of great strategic importance in a camnai-m snob as is now he,ng considered The, desire to urge that its possession by us should be assured by the construction of this line simultaneously with that through Persia, and thatthe advantage of its possession hy Russia, ifthey anticipate us, should be nullified by a decision never to extend the Nushki line to Seistan. 15. It, remains to consider what will be the strategic position if theso measures are given effect to. It will be seen from Appendix A, that Russia can develop forces of great numerical superiority to those at our disposal If rail-head of the Trans-Persian connection is brought to Nushki, the ultimate victory of Russia can only be a matter of time. But if the alignment is brought through and controlled at Bandar Abbas, the position is fa? less un favourable. Bor if owing to the difficulties of moving large forces far from rail ways and the slowness with which such railways can be constructed Russia should attempt an advance on India along the Trans-Persian railway as a single line of advance, she would be confornted by a fortress based upon our whole sea power. The historical instances of the lines of Torres Yedras and of Port Arthur show the possibilities for the defensive in such a position. If she ade.opted an advance on the Herat-Helmund line combined with an advance 1 on the Trans-Persian alignment, Great Britain would have all the stratedo advantage ot interior lines. The proposed connection from Karachi to Seistan will enable Great Britain to occupy a strong flank position which Russia could not ignore. If neglecting the Trans-Persian alignment, she were to advance on the Herat and Kabul lines alone, her interest in Persia would be open to our attack and our position in the theatres of Afghanistan would be strengthened by the Karachi-Seistan connection. ° 16. The commercial aspects of the scheme are not for the General Staff to consider, but it is permissible to point out that their proposals coincide with the views of the Board of Trade who consider that a line to a well known Gulf port, preferably Bandar Abbas, is a rine qua non. 3rd January 1311. D. Haig, Chief of the General Appendix A. Summary of present strategic position. In the strategical study of the North-West Frontier of India it is cal culated on the assumption that all forage required for transport animals cam be obtained locally in the country and will not have to be brought from Russia that the Russians can develop the following forces on the different lines of advance in the time stated in each case, from the date of Russian mobilisation commencing. On the Northern or Kabul line— Two months Four months Seven months ••• 38,000 on the Oxus. ... 18,000 on the Ghori Plain ...'j Rail-head is ad- 14.000 Tash Kurghan and Kunduz i phes'^r^being 10.000 Deb Dadi ... ... 50,000 Kamard Doshi Line. collected. After four months both sides have the maximum forces necessary concen trated in the front line and are consolidating their positions, collecting suppiie* and advancing rail-heads preparatory to a final advance to serious engagements Where these will taka place north of the Hindu Kush it is difficult y predict! It will depend on many conditions such as the season of the year &amp;c. ^ On the Southern or Kandahar Line— Two months •« • 6,000 at Herat; 50,000 at Koshk.Tour month* Seven months In the calculations on which the above results are based, it is assumed that the advance of the Russians on both lines will be opposed both by the Afghans •nd the British; but as all forage for transpoit aniiuals certainly cannot bo obtained locally, the above calculations are optimistic. ' 2. With the above results as a gui le, it is estimated that when-the proposed trans-Persian line is built to Nushki, and provided vr ith proper Jidinss, the Russians could in addition to tl.e forces mentioned in parai»r,*ph l develop the following forces on or within our frontier in Baluchis*an, where the new line will cross it; some 1,200 miles in advance of taeir preswnfc frontier at J ulfa. r 50,000 at Farah ...'1 The advanced troops will he spread » about Sabzawar and perhaps soms | will be in Seistan.

In support of the above estimate it may be stated that in the Russo- Japanese War, Russia succeeded in placing in Manchuria at the end of a single line of rails some 4,000 miles from Samara, where the Orenberg line bifurcates from the Siberian one, notwithstanding the hr ak in the line that existed at Lake Baikal during the early months oj the war :— From date of Russian mobilization commencing — One month ...

The possible alignments of the through connection are— (1) Nushki-Seistan-Kerman-Yezd-Tehran. (2) Karachi-Seistan (direct)-Yezd-Tehran. (3) Karachi-Charbar-Kerman-Yezd-Tehran. (4) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Kerman-Yezd-Tehran. (5) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Yezd (direct)-Tehran. (6) Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Shiraz-Julfa. The Nashki alignment is the one proposed in the enclosure to the Secre tary of State’s despatch. It is at no portion of its length subject to control by the sea power of Great Britain. It would enable Russia in the event of war to turn the Kandahar and Quetta positions an 1 to develop on the borders of India a force far stronger than we could oppose with Indian troops alone and to do so probably before we could obtain reinforcements from homo. It is for this reason that the General Staff urge that no extension of the Kushki lino should ever be undertaken. There is no position on this route suitable for a strong fortress that could delay the adv ance r f Russia’s land forces. This alignment possesses in fact every strategic disadvantage. The K ara chi- S cist a n * Teh ra n alignment comes within the control of sea power at Karachi, but it possesses nearly all the disadvantages of tae Nushki connection. The portion from Karachi to Seistan direct would he however advantageous to India as it would facilitate the movement of reinforcements from home to the theatre of war near Seistan. The Karachi-Charbor-Kerman alignment is controlled by sea power as far as Charbar, but the alianment at Kerman is dangerously close (260 miles) to Seistan. In the event of an advance by Russia her forces operating from the railway at Kerman and from Kushk post would be able to concentrate in overwhelming force on Seistan and thence to advance on India. The Helmund position would be turned by the force from Kerman an 1 we should be forced to accept decisive battle at the very gates of India near Quetta with interior forces. As regards the two suggested alignments (4) and (6) the military objec tions appear to be— The Kerman alignment brings Russia within 260 miles of Seistan and has the same objections as route (3). The Shiraz alignment is open to control by sea power throughout tho greater portion of its length, but the power administering the line will absorb almost at once the Persian littoral. This alignment would effectually cheek German extension into Persia. But if at any time Germany and Russia formed an alliance against Great Britain, India would be Very gravely threatened by it. The Karachi-Bandar Abbas-Yezd (direct)-Tehran alignment has the fewest strategic disadvantages in being most open to attack from the sea and in leading away from our position at Quetta and it is, therefore, advocated. ENCLOsritE No. 5. (Memorandum by the President of the Bailicay Board) The proposal appears (according to the papers received under Secretary of State’s despatch No. 32, dated 4th November 1910) to be—- (1) To build a railway from Baku rid Resht, Tehran, Kum, Ispahan and Yezd to Kerman and across the desert to Seistan, where a junction would be made with a line to be made by India from Nushki.The memorandum drawn up by the Hus c inn Consortium reco^nisei Seislanas tlift point, of junction as it states “the nearest point of the British Indian system is Nuskki from where the English are carrying a line to Seistan (2) The line to be built as an international one by Russia, Erance and England. 2. The Secretary of State asks that the scheme be considered by tbe Gov ernment of India both from the commercial point of view and also in respect to its immediate local consequences. He also requests that the Government of India will take into consideration the question of the railway connec tion between the Russian and Indian systems in general. 3. Taking first the commercial and immediate local consequences, it may foe said that— (*) As a through line connecting India and Europe, the proposal has no , claim to any merit from the Indian commercial point of view. The possibility of goods traffic being carried by the line between England and India is quite out of the question. (it) The difference in length between the rail and sea route to India, taking Karachi as a centre, will be very small, and the sea route will alwajs be by far the cheaper in cost of transport of goods, besides being more convenient and also shorter to places in the south of India. (tii) As regards passenger traffic, the volume of such traffic between England and India is of no great magnitude, and it would he years after the proposed line had been built, before a well- organised service could be installed between Calais and India, over the many different lines with various breaks of gauge over which it would have to run in Europe. Moreover, a passenger to any part of India except the north would find that when he had added the cost of his railway ticket from ISusliki to his destina tion in India, the total cost of his rail ticket from Calais to destination in India would be higher than the steamer fare which he would have to pay, as steamers have at the present time a large margin within which to reduce their fares. In regard to passenger traffic between England and India the prac tical effect; of the building of the railway will probably be that steamer fares will be reduced and they will still retain the traffic. Eurther passenger traffic between Europe generally and India must be small. There is no emigration traffic, such as the Siberian line carries and much revenue from this class of business could not be expected. 4. Tbe Siberian Railway cannot be taken as a parallel case on which any assumption can be built. The Siberian Railway route shortens the distance between the centre of Europe and the Ear East by a half. Moreover, it gives a direct railway route, much shorter than the sea route, to an area of country infinitely larger than India comprising, as it does, the important ports of China and Japan. The passenger traffic over tbe Siberian Railway is most cosmopolitan in character and of very considerable volume, due to the big interest which most of the European countries have in the Ear East. 5. When I travelled by the Siberian line from Port Arthur to Moscow ill 1904, there were express through trains running every other dav, the Wagon Lits Company providing every alternate train between Irkutsk and Moscow. Since 1904, the traffic has still further increased and the Wagon Lits Company now run their trains; there were also daily trains running at slower speed. 6. In addition to the through passenger traffic the Siberian line serves most important towns i.i Asiatic Russia, and affords a convenient means of transport of goods to areas which before could only have been served by a long sea route and a troublesome land journey by cart.7. Other points of difference could be indicated, showing the advantages of the Siberian Railway as a through route as compared to the usefulness of a line connecting India with Russia; but the main difference is that the Siberian line connects Europe by a short route with a large cosmopolitan population in the Far East, and opens up a cheaper route than the sea route for trade commodities, whereas the use of the through line between Russia and India only offers an alternative route to passengers between England and India with the disadvantage of a convenient and cheaper sea route to compete against, serving all the ports and different parts of the coast of India. Asa through line, therefore, between England and India, the scheme commercially has nothing to recommend it as a means of carriage either for goods or. passengers. 8. Considering now the position of the line as a commercial proposition, from the point of view of its probable local traffic an.l the stimulus which it. would give to the consumption of articles of foreign manufacture in Persia* a development of trade would certainly follow the construction of the line, but it does not necessarily follow that English trade woull benefit much by it It seems obvious that Russia, and other European countries adjacent, would have, a great advantage over Emrland in developing the trade of Northern and West ern Persia, but India should secure the trade of Southern Persia and Seistan. 9. As a railway proposition, however, it is not a scheme which one could recommend the Government of India to have anvthiug to do with from the financial point of view ; but the line is one of quite an unusual character and it has to he considered from other points than those affecting railway finance. 10. dhe attitude of India towards the scheme must obviously he largely based on the political situation. It seems clear that both Russia and Germany, intend exploiting Northern and Western Persia and, ii this cannot he avoided, the main point for consideration would see n to be to decide how the inevitable can he turned to some use for India and the Empire as a whole. 11. In the original Russian note, enclosure No. 1 to Secretary of State’s despatch No. 32, dated 4th November 1910, great stress is hid on the neces sity for the project being international. The words used are “ we could hardly hope for success if we started by dividing the line geographically into a Russian section in the Russian sphere of influence, and an English section in the English sphere”. From the telegram from the Secretary of State, dated the 30th December, however, it seems probable that Russia and Germany are coining to terms, which looks very much as if the international character of the through line would be put in the background, Russia with Germany’s consent making the line a Russian one in North Persia. 32. That North Persia will be opened out by a railway which will either be international or Russian seems certain and what India has now to do is to take advantage of the present position to consolidate itself in Southern Persia. Tim course indicated seems clear, and it is to welcome cordially the proposed through line as an international railway and to agree at once to make as part of the Indian Railway system a line from Nushki to some point in Seistan which is suitable for a junction with the international railway. 13. The ready acceptance by India of the international scheme would be a useful card in the direction of counteracting the negotiations now in progress between Russia and Germany which may lead to Northern Persia being opened out by a Russian railway wi h the same objects as were in mind when the Manchurian line was constructed to I’ort Arthur. 14. At the same time it would politically seem to justify India taking immediate steps to begin making the line from Nushki to Seistan, as practical evidence of its desire to carry out the international scheme and to do its share as soon as possible. Whatever might be the eventual outco ne of the proposed through line, India, at any rate, would have secured access on its own rails to Seistan and South Persia, whether the through line were made or not. 15. The line from Nushki to Seistan, which should be made solely by India, must cross over the border and have its terminus m Seistan at a placo suitable for a big railway terminus for reasons of practical railway working.16. The point of junction between the international railway and the Indian system of railways will he a place of large importance, and an essential condi tion is that it should be at a site where an ample supply of water was available, both for residential and railway working purposes, and this can only be found in Seistan. 17. Incidentally it may be remarked that there should be a change of gauge at this point of junction, and it would be as well at this stage to leave undecided the question of the gauge to be finally adopted between Nushki and Seistan, as a smaller gauge than that adopted for the international line has considerable advantages as regards the difficulties of converting it to a wider gauge if the line w r as in the future ever likely to be made use of for purposes of the invasion of India. 18. The policy proposed w T ould not place on India a financial risk of a character different to what she has cheerfully embarked on in the past in respect to frontier railways. Up to the present time a sum of approximately 25 to 30 crores of rupees have been spent on lines essentially made for military reasons. A sum of half a crore of rupees has only just been recently spent on the Loi-Shilman Railway, in order to provide a line still incomplete and ending at a place that makes it of no practical use for any purpose either military or commercial. 19. In the case of the proposed line from Nushki, it could he extended to Seistan for a sum of three crores of rnptes approximately. For such an important political object three crores is a very small sum. Besides this, granted a stable government in Persia, Seistan is a valuable area to tap by a railway, a matter which, I believe, lias been dealt with fully by Sir Henry McMahon in his report on Seistm. 20. The Nushki-Seistan route seems the best to adopt for linking up the Indian Railway system with the international line for the following reasons:— (a) It falls in with the proposals of the Russian Consortium and its coostruction by India would not excite any particular comment and be considered as simply carrying out a scheme that had already been decided on. The route would lie for practically the whole length in territory under British influence, Persian territory only being entered upon to the extent necessary to carry the rails to the site most suitable in Seistan for the establishment of the big junction station contemplated there. (If) On the other hand, a line from Karachi to Seistan traverses an extremely difficult country and would be costly to build and work. The Karachi-Bandar Abbas alignment would most probably give rise to very considerable political objection on the part of Russia. It would be avoiding the direct route and its cost would be very heavy indeed. It would also probably be urged that the adoption of this alignment was obviously with the intention of placing India in a specially favourable position as regards South Persia. ((?) The Nuskhi-Seistan line will he far cheaper, the probable figures ol cost based on Mr. Johns* reconnaissance would probably be— hi usbki to Seistan ,, ... 3 crores of rupees ; Karachi to Seistan ... ... 71 ditto.

It would seem that tlik important subjict will require special treatment; but it would be useful to place on record that the rates to be charged should be the subject of sneciM agreement between the parties holding the concession for the international Ikes23 28. To sum up I rentura to think that the attitude of India towards this matter should be— (1) To cordially accept and support the proposal that an international ; line should he made from Seistan to Baku. (21 To assist in this project India would build at once, with its own funds, the line from N ushki to Seistan and include it m her railway system. The gauge of this line at the present time to be left to India to decide, but it be made an essential point that a break of gauge should cccur at Seistan junct on. (3) The sole right to make railways in Persia should be secured by the ■ 7 concessionaires oL‘ the international line and all branches should be built internatior ally. (41 The basis on which railway rates are to ho charged should be a matter for future consideration and agreement. (5) Detailed surveys of the Nushki-Seistan should 1)0 put in hand at once. ■ 29 If it is ultimately decided that India should support the proposed international line all branches to he made under the same international anange- ' the branches from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and Bushire to Ispahan being essentially parts of the whole project if possible it would be very advisable to urge the claim of India to be allowed to actually construct these two branches for the international Company. The international scheme in character is very like the Suez canal and Panama canal projects and enormous sums will be spent on flotation and large profits made out of placing and carrying out contracts, and it will be a long time before the public can be educated up to taking up shares. On economica grounds, therefore, it would be of advantage to have these two branches constructed by Indian agency, and it would be of still greater advantage it India offered to find the money to build these tw r o lines in anticipation of the actua promotion of the international Company and the finding ot its capital. If the international scheme fai!»d to mature, India would be left with two useful branches in Persia secured by taking advantage of the present state of affairs. 30. As an official reason why India should make these branches it might be urged that she has immense experience of the construction of railways m countries like Persia, that she has staff and material ready at hand and could be&lt;nn work at ones and carry it out economically. ® T. R . Wynne, 6(A January 1911. President, Railway Board.Enclosure No. 6. Report of the Committee on the proposed Trans-Persian Railway. The proposal of the Russian Consortium on which the Secretary of State asks the opinion of the Government of India, is the construction of a railway line from Baku to Tehran, thence via Kum, Kashan, Yezd to Kerman, and thence to Nushki via Seistan.* It is stated that the construction of a railway in Persia is not an object complete in itself, but simply a means towards the realisation of “a world route to unite by one eontiuuous line of rails Europe to India and other countries in the Ear East”. The more immediate object of the promoters appears to be the development of Russian trade with Persia, which is now threatened by the Baghdad Railway and the increasing interest of Germany in the Middle East. It is also remarked incidentally that the line would iecure Russians strategic position in Turkey and in Western Trans-Caucasia. The line is to be constructed as an international undertaking, the participants being Russia, Great Britain, France and possibly Persia. The cost of construction is estimated a| 2U6,950,000 roubles and the possible profits at 15 per cent on the subsciibed capital. The Government of India are asked for their views on the question of railway connec tion in general and the particular proposal put forward in the Russian memorandum, and •their advice is specially asked upon the commercial aspects of the project, and its immediate local consequences. 2. It may be convenient at the outset to offer a few observations on the general Advantages and question of the pros and cons of a connection by land between Europe and India by way of a disadvantages Traus-Persian Railway. oomooTwI The question may first be considered from the point of view of the defence of India Europe and against foreign invasion. By the operation of the Anglo-Russian Convection we are secured India, for the present from the fear of a Russian invasion of India, but in the nature of things («) Strategical the possibility of hostilities with Russia at some future date cannot altogether be ignored anc * political. In view of this possibility it is clear that any material improvement of laud communications towards or through the natural barriers which at present encircle the frontiers of India must involve a great increase to the military responsibilities of India,—responsibilities which are already inconveniently heavy. From the purely strategical point of view therefore it would undoubtedly be preferable that India should maintain her ^acvi-insular position and should refuse to co-operate in any scheme which would tend to facilitate the transportation of a hostile Power up to or across her frontier. We recognise, however, that the march of events in the Near and Middle East renders it impossible that this position of isolation can be indefinitely maintained. The advent of the Baghdad Railway combined with the impotence of Persia must inevitably disturb the quo, while the prospect of a Russo-German combination in the event of our refusal to co-operate in the Russian scheme compels us to reconsider the position from a wider outlook. From this standpoint it seems to us desirable to seize the opportunity which the present proposal offers for securing the conditions which we consider essential rather than to wait until circumstances may force us to permit the connection on terms which may be less advantageous. 3. With regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, we ^ Commercial. «re in general agreement with the opinions expressed in the letter from the Board of Trade to ' the Foreign Office of L3th September 1910 and in Mr. Worthington's memorandum forwarded therewith. We do not consider that there is any likelihood of goods being carried on the ’railway from the United Kingdom to India or vice-versa. The cost of transport by sea, especially to the south of India, will always be cheaper than by rail, and the sea route will have the further advantage of avoiding the re-handling of the goods at a continental port and ■at the points at which breaks of gauge may occur. We are iuclined to doubt also whether ithe through passenger traffic on the railway would be of any great magnitude. The volume of such traffic between the United Kingdom and India is not very large or likely to increase in any considerable degree, since there is no emigration to India such as is carried on the trans-Siberian line; and it seems probable that a reduction in fares would enable the steam-ship companies to retain the bulk of the existing traffic. As regards the local traffic northwards from India into Persia, no doubt the railway would lead to some development of this trade, but it is impossible to form any estimate as to the amount of such increase in view of the wide difference between the conditions under which the traffic is now carried on and those which would be created by the existence of the railway. The natural channel for Indian trade to Persia is • A subsequent telegram from the Secretary of State, dated 30th December, shows that the Russian Consortium now favour an alignment »ia Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, but that the Russian Government prefer that th» line should run from Tehran south-east to Kerman to avoid the possible risk of eventual intersection by a German line at Ispahan.25 throuo-b the ports of the Persian Gulf, and we have little douht that the construction of lines from those ports into the interior would be of much greater benefit from the purely commercial point of view than the construction of the through line. We may note here that we are unabletoacceptasinany way accurate the estimate given by the Consortium of the revenue that may be expected from the line. Prom anticipated by the Net revenue Consortium is ... Taking the Rouble ns=Rs. 1-9-0 in Indian currency, the net revenue whl be Taking working expenses at fi0°/ o the gross earnings, to secure this revenue must be ... ... — The length of the line from Baku to Nushki being 2,150 versts or 1,400 miles, in order to produce the gross receipts above given, the line must earn per mile per week the sum of ... Roubles. 1,18,00,000 Es. 1,85,00,000 4,62,00,000 655 from the line. the calculations shown in the margin it would appear that the estimate of the Ccnsortium is based upon the assumption that the proposed lire will earn per mile per week the sum of Rs. 655. Judging by the earnings obtained upon our Indian frontier railways, we anticipate that the gross earnings per mile per week over the whole of the proposed line can hardly he expected to exceed Rs. 120 per mile per week or 4dh of the Consortium's estimate. The estimate given by the Consortium of tha cost of construction is also, in our opinion, an inadequate allowance. Persia is a mountainous country, labour will be scarce and communications daring i “' construction difficult. With y Alignment the main through line. of India, we fear that the cost of the proposed the Consortium by at least 50 per cent. The proposed line can, therefore, hardly be expected to prove a financial success. At the same time the existence of a railway which would open un the country could hardly fail to produce a general expansion of trade in Persia, Improved communicati ons will mean the gradual removal of those obstacles to commerce arising from the disturbed state of the country; from the difficulties relating to exchange and remittance; the long delays between the placing and execution of orders; and the impracticability of efficient supervision and control of agencies. But we cannot avoid the conclusion that a line following the route proposed by the Consortium would be far more advantageous to Russian than to Indian trade, though this result might he neutralised to some extent if we were able to secure that branch lines should be simultaneously constructed to connect the Gulf ports, such as Bandar Abbas and Bushire, with the main line. We also consider that it would be essential that stipulations should be insisted upon to insure that there shall be no differential treatment on any part of the railway for the nationals of any country in respect of rates, fares or general facilities. 4. While, therefore, from the point of view of military policy there can be little quest on that the mainten mee of the status quo would be preferable to the construction of the proposed railway, and while it seems at least doubtful whether the advantages to Indian trade would be at all commensurate with the advantages which would accrue to Russian trade with Persia, or with the financial outlay involved in the undertaking, we are nevertheless of opinion that having regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share in the control of any railway that may be made m Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining conces sions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, the Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposals of the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may be considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade. 5. We will now proceed to examine in detail the various proposals which have been made and to set forth the conditions which we consider to be essential before the Government of India agree to participate in the proposed undertaking. The first question to be considered is that of the alignment of the main through line between Russia an 1 India. W T ith the northern portion of the alignment between Baku and Yezd we are only remotely concerned, but we think it right to notice that the alignment proposed by the Consortium, viz., Tehran. Kum, Kashan, Ispahan and Yezd, is preferable on commercial grounds to the direct line from Tehran to Kerman proposed by the Russian Government, since the latter would leave untapped the important trade centres of Kum, Kashan and Ispahan. 6. Fiom the Indian print of view the important part of the alignment is that by which the railway approaches the frontier of India, namely, the portion from Yezd onwards. Three alternative routes Lave been suggested, namely,— (1) T he proposal of the Consortium, which is also favoured by Sir Henry McMahon, for a due from Yezd to Kerman and thence across the desert to Seistan and Nushki. Length approximately 810 miles. (2) The route suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, viz., Yezd, Kerman, Bam, Repan, Barnpur, Sarbaz, thence across the Perso-Briti-h frontier near Kej and thence to Karachi or Hyderabad. Length approximately 1.117 miles. (3) I he route advocated by the Indian Geneial Staff, viz , Yezd to Bandar Abbas and thence miles. along the coast to Karachi. Length approximately 1,341The relative advantages and disadvantages of these three routes are examined in the succeeding paragraphs :— If the object of the proposed railway be taken as the connection of Russia with India by the quickest cheapest and easiest route, this alignment seems to be preferable to either of the other two which have been suggested. The distance between Yezd and Nusbki wa Kerman and Seistan is 810 miles only as compared with 1,147 and 1341 miles between Yezd and Karachi by the other two routes: and although Karachi is immeasurably superior to Nushki as a point of junction with the Indian railway system and as a distributing centre for goods, the difference in length between the Nuskhi and Karachi routes remams an important factor in the situation. There would, it is true, be engineering difficulties to surmount in crossing the mountains which surround Kerman, and the scarcity of fresh water in the desert between Kerman and Nasratabad and between Robat and INusbbi might also be a source of considerable inconvenience. But the route lies in the mam through flat country which, as would appear from the reconnaissance made by Mr. Johns m 1903, would present few obstacles to railway construction. It is also a point in ray our ot this alignment that it would give access to the rich and well-watered tract of beistan, which, in the opinion of so well-informed an authority as Sir H. McMahon is capable of rapid development if a market can be found for its surplus products. _ But against these advantages have to be set objections, both strategical and political, the importance of which can hardly be overstated. To take the political objections first— it cannot be doubted, in view of the attitude taken by the Amir of Afghanistan towards the Anglo-Russiau Convention, that His Majesty will regard the construction of a railway alono* bis southern border as a further indication of a design on the part of Russia to impair hfs independence, if not to absorb his territories. This aspect of the question has been touched on by Sir H. McMahon in paragragh 15 of his report, but with all respect to his authority we doubt whetner he has adequately recognised the gravity of the objection to the Seislan-Nushki alignment on this score. However baseless the idea may be, there will not be wanting advisers who will put a sinister construction on the project in its relation to Afghanistan and w- fear that the alarm and suspicion that will be engendered may give rise to tribal excitement which may prove beyond His Majesty’s power to control. The construction of the line would in fact prove to be a potent instrument in the hands of those who make it their business to sow ill-feeling between the British Government and the ruler and people of Afghanistan, and we apprehend that the process of restoring confidence might involve us m undesirable complications with the other Powers who will be interested in the undertaking. Even if this be avoided, there is the risk that trouble may arise between ourselves and the Amir over the distribution of the water of the Helmand on which the development ef Seistan largely depends. The strategical objections to the Seistan-Nushki alignment are even more cogent. The adoption of this route would give to Russia a railway leading directly to the frontier of Afghanistan, and would enable her, in the event of war, to turn the Kandahar and Quetta positions. It would also facilitate the transportation by Russia of a very large army across two almost waterless deserts—a task which, under present conditions and without the help of a railway, may be regarded as practically impossible of accomplishment. As against this, India would receive ro compensating strategical advantages. A line ;o Seistau from Nushki might to some extent assist India to control Western Afghanistan, but no point is offeied from which a force from India could undertake offensive operations against Russia; while the extendon of our line to Seistan would make it difficult to resist a'claim on the part of Russia to connect the Trans-Caspian Railway with the proposed route, in which case she would be able to concentrate from two directions. Finally, the adop tion of the Seistan-Nushki alignment would, owing to its distance from the sea coast, completely neutralise the strategical advantage which Great Britain possesses in her naval supremacy. (1) Yezd-Ker- man-S e i s t a n- N u sliki align ment These objections are, in our view, of so grave a character that the Government of India would be justified in offe.’ing the strongest opposition to the proposal for railway conuection beuween Russia ami India via Kerman, Seistan, and the Nushki route, 7. We will now consider the advantages and disadvantages of the other two alignments ( 2 ) Yezd-Ker- which have been suggested, namely, Yezd-Kerman-Bam-Bampur-Kej-Karachi and Yezd-man-Bam-Ram- Bandar Abbas-Karachi, and would preface our remarks by explaining that information reo-ard- Puy-Kej-KH*m- ing these two routes is _ confined to that obtainable from the route books, which furnish°very Bandar Abbas? inadeq ate material for judging the suitability of the routes they describe for railway construe- Karachi aligu- tion. Our recommendations must, therefore, be considered as suoject to modification after men ts. actual railway surveys and investigations have been made. It ^is obvious in the first place that the political and strategical objections which apply to the Seistan-Nushki alignment do not apply with the same force to either of the routes above mentioned. A line connecting Kerman or Bandar Abbas with Karachi would be far removed from the Afghan border and would not excite the apprehensions of the Afghan people in any acute degree, while the sel ction of the sea coast route would enable Great Britain to make effective use of her naval supremacy in resisting any possible hostile attack by way of the proposed railway. It would also, as Colonel Cox points out, provide effective means for checking the arms traffic through. Mekran. These considerations, in our opinion,i imrntm Branch lines- (1) In the British zone. • Colonel Cox mentions three possible points at srhich the line might touch the coast, vie., Gwetter, Gwadur and Pnsni. We have taken the latter as being on the more direct route. Our remarks apply with slight modification to the routes via Gwetter aud Gwadur. (2) In the neutral zone. 27 render it essential that the Government of India shonld select the Karachi connection in preference to that Seistan and Nuskki. Taking now the comparative advantages of the two routes ending at Karachi, we may first 0 give a general description or the country on the Pasni, * Bampur, Bam, Kerman and Yezd alignment. The length of the route, as taken from the route books, is 1,147 miles From Karachi to Pasni (296 miles) the line would run in the vicinity of the sea shore; the grade would he level and the chief works would he those connected with the crossing of creeks and drainage from the hills. The only point of doubt iu respect of this portion of the route is whether the fresh water supply for working locomotives would be sufficient. This is a matter which will need careful investi gation At Pasni the Hua would turn to the north-west and running by a sloping, hilly country for 150 miles would cross a range 3,000 feet high, dropping beyond to a level of 1 500 feet. From this point there would again be a steady rise till about the 800th mile, where a very sharp rise would have to be faced, the line to reach Kerman having to cross a ridwe 8 400 feet high and dropping into the town beyond to 5,600 feet level. From Kerman to 'Yezd the line “would be at a high level, but with no ranges of any height to cross. In the absence of any information as to the cost of making railways in Persia, it is difficult to frame any estimate of the cost of this section of the line. But labour and supplies would be scarce and, in view of the engineering difficulties of the alignment, the cost of construction and cost of working would certainly be very high. In so fai as we aie abls to frame an estimate, we would put the cost cf the section between Karachi and Yezd viJ Pasni and Kerman at not less than 17 crores of rupees. Turnino- to the alternative route, viz., from Karachi along the coast to Bandar Abbas and thence direct to Yezd, the section as far as Bandar Abbas should offer no particular difficulties as regards construction, and it would provide a level road +o run over. From Bandar Abbas to Yezd the general slope of the country is easy and there is no abrupt rise such as is met on the Pasni-Kerman section. As an engineering proposition, therefore, the seciion from Bandar Abbas to Yezd does not appear to be open to any great objection. We estimate the cost of constructing the entire line from Karachi to Yezd via Bandar Abbas roughly at 14 crores of rupees, as against 17 crores for the Yezd-Kerman-Karachi route. As a through route between Russia and° India it would certainly be quicker than the Kerman route, though of greater length, since the easier grades would permit of a faster train service. This alignment also possesses the strategical advantages— (1) That it avoids bringing the through line to Kerman, which is only 280 miles from the Afghan border. (2) That the entire route from Bandar Abbas to Karachi will lie sufficiently near the coast to allow the co-operation of the sea and land forces of the Empire in its defence. The Bandar Abbas-Karachi coast line would, it is true, do little towards developing trade with the interior of Persia, but we would propose, if this route is adopted, that a branch line should be run either from Bandar Abbas or Char bar to Regan and Bam with a possible later extension to Kerman. The connection of Kerman with a port on the coast by means of a branch line would have this advantage over its inclusion in the main through route that it would enable Indian commerce to compete for the south-eastern Persian market on more favourable terms than would be the case if Russia were able to transport her goods direct to Kerman. We would recommend, therefore, that on strategical and political grounds the Govern ment of India should express a strong preference for the connection with Karachi, and that, of the two possible routes connecting Karachi with the main line, they should select that via Bandar Abbas and Yezd as being the easier, quicker, more economical, and more advan tageous from the point of view of military defence. 8 . We have next to consider the important question of the branch lines to be constructed in the event of the proposals for the through route coming to maturity. Assuming that the Kerman-Seistan-Nushki alignment is rejected, there will be no absolute necessity from the commercial or strategical point of view for the construction of a branch from Bandar Abbas to Kerman, but, as we have already indicated, it would be most desirable that, with a view to the development of our trade with Persia, entry into the markets of south-eastern Persia should be secured by a branch line from some port on the coast within the British sphere. Whether this branch should lead from Bandar Abbas or from some other port, such as Ckarbar, we would leave for future decision after the routes have been examined, but we think it desirable that in the negotiations to be entered into with Russia it should be stipulated that it should be open to Great Britain to construct a branch line connecting Kerman with the coast by whatever route may prove to be the most convenient. Tt is further important in our opinion to make it a condition of our acceptance of the main proposal that Russia will support us in obtaining such concessions for branch linesJ n the neutral w .?f)ne will operate to exclude Germany from obtaining .position ia the Persian Gulf. The lines which Colonel Cox recommends are a predominating (1) From Mohammerah to Julfa. (2) From Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Kerman. (3) From Bandar Abbas to Shiraz. We concur with Colonel Cox as to the supreme importance of obtainino. some such . concessions as a cond tion precedent to our co-operation in the main through route. We are , not . aware how far Russia has pledged herself to support Germany in obtaining an outlet for the Baghdad railwav on the Persian Gulf. But there is clearly a dano-er that if an agreement is not arrived at between ourselves and Russia on the subject of branch lines in the neutral zone, Germany may subsequently obtain such a position on the Gulf as must seriously jeopardise our interests, both commercial and strategical. We would, there fore, recommend that, in addition to sunporting us in obtaining a concession for a line from Bandar.Abbas or Charbar to Bam and Kerman, Russia be asked to co-operate with us in , securing concessions for railway lines— (1) From Mohammerah to Hamadan, or to such point between Mohammerah and Julfa JW will intersect the extension of the Baghdad Railway between Khanikin and Tehran. (2) From Mohammerah via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz to Bandar Abbas. (3) From Bushire to Shiraz and thence to Ispahan . These concessions should, we think, be adequate to prevent the intrusion of the German line into the neutral zone, provided that a guarantee is obtained from Persia that she will grant no other concessions in this zone which are likely to compete with the lines which we have indicated. The lines from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Bam or Kerman and from Mohammerah northwards should, we think, be proceeded with simultaneous!v with the construction of the main line; the other concessions would not necessarily be* utilised in practice, but would be retained for blocking purposes. Meanwhile, it would be an advantage to, make detailed surveys of all the proposed routes in order that there may be no unnecessary delay when once it is decided to proceed with any particular scheme. ' 9. We observe that the Consortium contemplate the internationalisation of the through Internationalis- line. We think that in view of the recent negotiations between Russia and Germany in ation of through regard to the connection of the Baghdad railway wit.i tho through Persian line, it is of para- b r tt n 0 k mount importance that the through line should be international. Otherwise we are faced with the possibility of a Russian line being constructed through Northern Persia linked wit&amp; the Baghdad railway and operating by differential rates to the detriment of British trade. We consider further that it would be an advantage, with a view to maintaining full oppor tunities for the development of trade, that all branch lines made within Persia itself, should be internationalised. As to the Powers which should he admitted to participate in these international projects we can offer no useful opinion. But we assume that Russia and Great Britain will retain a preponderating share in the undertaking, and that any financial responsibility incurred by the latter will be borne equally by the Indian and Imperial exchequers. We think also that it would be a distinct advantage to offer a certain number of shares to the Persian Government with a view both to enlist their interest in the successful working of the line and to obviate any suspicion that the project is likely to affect the integrity of Persia. Should this be decided, it would be necessary to stipulate that Persia should not part with her shares without the consent of Russia and Great Britain. 10. A subsidiary question which has to be considered is that of the gauge to be adopted The question for the through route, and the place where the break of gauge, if there is to be one, should of gauga. be located. We are of opinion that from the point of view of the security of India, it is of the utmost importance that the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zone in Persia should be different from that of the line passing through the Russian zone. We also think that India should have the right to select the gauge for this section and that it shou'd be narrower than the gauge on the northern section of the line: since a hostile Power would find it much more difficult to widen a narrow gauge than to lay a line within a broader gauge. We think that, from the Indian point of view, the most suitable place for the change of gauge would be at a port on the Gulf, and we recommend that Bandar Abbas, which is on the border of the British zone, be selected for the purpose. 11. There is one further point which we desire to mention before closing our report. Ifc will be seen from what has been said above that the governing considerations in determining the alignment for the through route are, in our opinion, those connected wiih the attitude of the Amir and the effect of the proposed railway on the problem of the defence of India. It will be for His Majesty's Government to decide how far thtse considerations should be pot forward in discussing the question with the Russian Government. But we suggest that, in dealing with a matter of such vital importance to India, it would not be out of { lace to state plainly to the Russian Government the reasons for u hu h Great Britain is unable to assent to the Kerman-Seistan-Nushki connection and to invite a frank exchange of views on the subject.It culd te explained that from the British point of view the preferable course is to mamtara the strategic isolation of India and to avoid the outlay of vast sums of money on a project which offers bnt little prospect of financial success or of commarcial advantage; that in aoreeinos to co-operate with Russia in the construction of the through l.ns, we are making /considerable sacrifice; and that the only stipulations we think it necessary to make are such as will safeguard the vital interests of Great Britain. In return for this sacrifice it would, we suggest, hardly be too much to ask Kussia to forego once and for all any design for the extension of the Trans-Caspian Railway along the border of Afghanistan in the direction of the Indian frontier—an extension which, in tne words of the Russian Consortium, would be strategically rat'-er dangerous for the English”. We recommend therefore that, in addition to ttuTother stipulations which we have mentioned, the acceptance of the proposed through connection be made conditional on the giving of a pledge by Russia that she will not at any time, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, entertain or support any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Peiso-Afghau border within tae Russian or neutral zones. 12. To summarise our conclusions:—we recommend that the Government of India accept the proposals of the Russian Consortium in principle, subject to the following modific ations and conditions :—• ( fl ) that the point of junction of the main through route with the Indian railway system be at Karachi and not at Nushki j that the route from Yezd to Karachi be via Bandar Abbas and thence along the sea coast, subject to reconsideration as the result of actual survey; that concessions be obtained for branch lines— (i) from Bandar Abbas or Charbar to Regan, Baca and Kerman; (ii) from Mohammerah to Hamadan j (iii) from Mohammerah to Bandar Abbas via Khor Musa, Behbehan and Shiraz; (iv) from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan ; that both the main and the branch lines in Persian territory be international, Russia and Great Britain holding a preponderating share and Persia being admitted to participate; that the gauge of the line passing through British territory and the British zone be different from that of the line in the Russian zone, and that the break of gauge be at Bandar Abbas on the limit of the British zone; that in return for our co-operation in the main project, Russia should pledge herself not to entertain or support, without coming to an understanding with Great Britain, any proposal for a line in the neighbourhood of the Perso- Afghan border within the Russian or neutral zones.

This note was written before I had the opportunity of seeing the Memo randum by the General Staff. It dealt entirely with the proposal of the Russian Consortium from the railway print of view irrespective of military and political considerations. The only point I should like to modify is my estimate of 20 crores as the cost of a line from Karachi to Bandar Abbas. From the information I then had at my disposal it appeared that the cost of the line would be very heavy. When the question was being considered subsequently by the committee I had access to route books of Persia and was able to make a section of the country along the coast and obtain a more accurate idea of the cost of making a line along it. I would therefore ask that the figure of 20 crores which I originally estimated the Karachi-Bandar Abbas line would cost might be reduced to 9 crores. 20th February 1911. T. R.

From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, K.CJ.E. C.S.I , Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your endorsement No. 2604 E.-A. of 3rd December 1910, in which I am desired to furnish my views on the proposed scheme for the connection of the European and Indian Railway systems by the construction of a line across Persia. 2. The lack of complete information regarding the country through which the proposed line is to run ; the absence of reliable data and statistics of its potential possibilities, or even its existing trade requirements, render it impossible to deal with the present problem on the usual lines. Any detailed forecast of the financial results of the line or its general effect on Persia and adjoining countries is at present impossible. All that can he done in these circum stances is to treat the subject on broad lines and endeavour to arrive at general conclusions. 3. Impartial consideration of the subject is moreover hampered at the outset by the fact that we, as a nation, have always been accustomed to “ insularity ”, and have so long endeavoured to maintain the insularity of our Indian Empire, by an impassable barrier of buffer States, and that we cannot be expected to accord a welcome to any scheme which threatens to invade our isolation and bring us, as the proposed railway must do, into direct contact by rail with the outer world. J So strong is the natural tendency to oppose any change from existing conditions, that there is every danger of our failing to recognise in a proposal such as the present one, advantages which would be self-apparent to other European nations or even our own Canadian Dominion, to whom intercommu nication by railway with adjoining countries is an accepted condition of ordinary life. J In our effort to consider the problem without undue bias we must, however endeavour, when steering wide of the Scylla of unreasonable opposition, not to shipwreck on the Charybdis of blind acceptance. 4. However anxious we may rightly he not to expedite a new order of things we must admit the futility of expecting that the present want of com munications with, and in Persia, can much longer prevent access to the world’* trade, or form a barrier to European nations in their rivalry for new and larger markets. No less necessary is it to recognise the risk that, if we decline the opportunity now afforded, of a joint arrangement with Russia, to open up Persia by railway to the advantange of our mutual trade, Russia may be compelled, by the necessities of the new situation created by the coming Baghdad Railway, to make joint railway arrangements with some other Power in which our advan tages and requirements would be ignored. We should doubtless in the end beJ 2 compelled to face the very evils we now wish to avoid, and connect our Indian Railway system with one which might not receive us in an amicable spirit or on favourable terms. It is obviously essential to recognise the above contingency, before proceed ing to consider the present proposal, because arguments of a political, com mercial, and military nature, which may now be urged against its adoption, may be no less cogent at the moment when necessity hereafter compels us to stultify ourselves by ignoring them. 5. It is proposed to connect the Russian and Indian Railway systems by a line from Baku through Persia to India. The line will probably leavm the coaat of the Caspian near Enzeli, some 250 miles east of Baku, and pass through or near Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman. From Baku to the Indian border of Persia, the line will be about 1,100 miles in length. 6. Prom the commercial point of view it is obvious that the line will benefit Russian trade to an enormous and preponderating extent. As stated by the authors “ all the freights of the Volga will get a considerable advantage over foreign goods over a great part of Persia.” The force of this statement is the more self-evident, if one remembers that goods from the Caspian littoral and the Volga need not take to the railway at Baku, but can be water borne as far as Enzeli, thus further diminishing the rail journey by over 200 miles. It will be difficult for British goods to compete in these circumstances with similar Russian goods in any part of interior Persia. To give British trade any fair chance of competing at all, it will be necessary to construct branch lines northwards to meet the central line from the coast. That from Bandar Abbas to Kirman appears the one to be built first, as being within our own sphere and therefore to be under our sole control. Others from Ahwaz to Ispahan and Bushire through Shiraz will doubtless follow in due course. 7. It is not only in Persia itself, however, that the line will benefit Russian trade, for it will open out to it many fields of commercial enterprise in India. The following table of comparative distances of a few places selected at random will suffice to illustrate this:— Baku to Quetta ... 1,500 miles. Baku to the Indo-Persian frontier 1,100 9&gt; Enzeli to Quetta 1,300 JJ Enzeli to the Indo-Persian frontier 800 If Calcutta to Quetta ... 1,700 If Calcutta to Peshawar 1,500 If Bombay to Peshawar (by rail) ... • «« 1,500 II Bombay to Quetta (by rail) • • • 1,300 II Bombay to Delhi ... • • • 1,000 f» Karachi to Peshawar ... 1,000 If Quetta to Lahore • •• 800 II Quetta to Kirman 800 If Quetta to Delhi 900 II Quetta to Yezd • • • 900 II Quetta to Karachi • • • 600 II 8. The same table, however, serves to illustrate the advantage which will accrue to Indian trade from the proposed line, and it may be confidently expected that a very great impulse will be given thereby to Indian trade throughout Persia. The distance by rail from Delhi to Yezd, it will be observed, is but little more than from Bombay or Calcutta to Peshawar or Quetta. 9. 'We have as yet only considered the Persian railway from the aspect as a trade carrier, and it is now necessary to consider it in its more importantty;—- i mli ifnim tkikliii y«ds 111 H ¥ w » \ i aspect of a trade producer. In an isolated and undeveloped country, such as Persia, the introduction of a railway line cannot fail to have most important and far-reaching effects on trade. It must inevitably, as has been the case in every country in the world, lead to the development of agriculture and other natural resources, ami nowhere perhaps do greater possibilities or room for such development exist than in Persia. There are vast tracts of good land everywhere lying unused and only needing the small capital necessarv for reopening the old Karezes by which they used to be irrigated. Nearer India it will pass close to the existing fertile tract of Seistan, whose wealth of surplus products will at last find a market. This must automatically lead to the rapid development of that rich country and further swell the volume of local trade. Next will follow in the natural course of events the exploration and develop ment of the mineral resources of the country, which are known to exist but which, through want of transport facilities, have hitherto not been considered worth investigating. Last but not least, the existing local products of Persia, such as ghee, hides and grain, wool, &amp;c., which either absence or cost of transport have made it impossible or unprofitable to export, will become available for export and thus will be removed what is now the principal impediment to Persian trade deve lopment, i.e., the dearth of exports for the payment of imports. These are great and solid advantages which will benefit British, Russian i and Indian trade alike. They should go far to compensate, through increased bulk, British and Indian trade for the more favoured position which the new line will give to Russian trade in its competition with ours. 10. It will, however, be imperatively necessary, in order to prevent Russia deriving more than its proper share of these and other trade advantages, to take steps to ensure British and Indian trade obtaining an equal start 5 as regards time. Unless strenuous steps are taken Russian trade will be able to make use of the new line before we can do so, and it will be difficult for us to make up for lost time. The line should therefore be commenced simultaneously from 1 both ends. / Russia can commence the railway at her own door, whereas we have yet to traverse a wide stretch of country to reach the Persian frontier. It is there fore essential to extend our Indian Railway system to Persia by the shortest and easiest route and to do so in the least possible time. The only route which meets these requirements is that to Nushki. Military and commercial reasons will ultimately necessitate a line from Karachi, but it will be unwise to use that route in the first instance. Prom the valuable railway reconnaissance made by Mr. Johns in 1903, it will be seen that a line from Nushki to the Persian border, 360 miles in length, admits of very easy and rapid construction. It is estimated that it could be built within two years at a cost of *198 lakhs, whereas the line from Karachi (through Kondi) to the same point on the Persian border would traverse a country presenting very serious engineering difficulties ; it would be over 700 miles in length, cost * 750 lakhs and take some 8 years to construct. The value of the Karachi line to sea-borne British trade would moreover be greatly minimized by the line from Bandar Abbas or other Gulf seaport northwards. Not only therefore should the Nushki-Robat line be pushed forward with the greatest possible speed, without waiting for the commencement of the line from Baku, but work on the line from Bandar Abbas northwards, and as far as possible, from the Indo-Persian border westwards, should be begun simultaneously with the commencement of the Russian ends of the main Persian line. * These figures are only approximate and apply to a railway line of 62 lb. rails. They are valuable as indication of relative cost, and it should be remembered that the cost of the Karachi line, from the nature of the country to be traversed, is more likely to exceed the present rough estimate than the easy ushki line. The 750 lakhs of the Karachi line are arrived at by taking Mr. Johns’ estimate of 668 lakhs for tho line Karachi to Kondi and adding 82 lakhs for the portion onwards to the Persian border, at or near Robat, at the averae'a cost ner mile of the Robat-N ushki estimate. * per A. H. McMaho*.To facilitate action when the time comes, it would appear advisable to start railway surveys from Nushki Robat and Bandar Abbas with the least 11 Of the financial success of the line itself I do not think that there is any reason to be sceptical. Whatever the discomfort of the Ions rail journey . compared to that by sea to Europe from the East may be, it is but reasonable to expect that the majority of travellers will he tempted to use the former route either from motives of economy or from desire to traverse the countries through which the line will run. This will apply n 'd “''y to travellers to and from India but to those between Australia and China. The number of through passengers on which the estimate of income as based may appear large at first sight, but I do not think that it is unduly so. On Te othe? hand, I am inclined to think that the receipts from loca passengers have been und« rather than over estimated. The amount of local traffic which a railway creates even in the most unpromising areas is often suiprising. As an instance of this I may quote the line from Quetta to Nushki. W construction of the line ivas under consideration the prospect of _ a remuner ative local traffic was hardly thought worthy of being taken into account owin' to the seemingly uninhabited area it traversed. Nevertheless, the amount of local traffic has been such as to convert what was feared would be an unremunerative strategic line into a commercially profitable one. Similarly, there is considerable reason to suppose that the line onward will, in Persia, develop a local traffic of a more extensive and lucrative nature than that now estimated for. Incidentally the through traffic on the proposed line will tend to increase the receipts of the Indian systems to a very considerable extent, by attracting ,1 many passengers through India who would otherwise travel by sea without | set tin 'foot in this country. It is necessary to give due credit to this factor and also to the additional income from the carriage of the increased bulk of Indo-Persian goods on Indian lines, when considering the question of guarantees to the new undertaking. 12. It is necessary next to regard the proposal from the political and mill- tary point of view. This can best be done together, as the difficulty of separat- ing political from military considerations is very considerable, and tor reason only do I venture to trespass on military ground. We are now brought face to face with new problems, and strong though the inclination may be to avoid their consideration by opposing the proposa ab initio, it is necessary to tackle them seriously and impartially. In the first place, the proposed railway line through Persia involves the necessity of ensuring its safety throughout its length. It is unreasonable o expect a lucrative passenger or goods traffic, if the line has to run, in turn, t e gauntlet of Bakhtiaii brigands or disappointed and exasperated Afghan gun runners. It will have to be safeguarded from both. The existence of thtf line will itself facilitate measures for dealing with troubles of this nature, but the real difficulty which the protection of the me involves is one common to several other questions connected with its construc tion and maintenance, its relation to the future of the*Persian Governmen . In this case the adequate protection of the line affects the future not only of a railway but of a nation. On the ability of the Persian Government to meet its responsibilities in regard to the line depends the consolidation or dis integration of Persian autonomy. On this again depends the effect of the line on the military and political problems of India. Needless to say that any support we give to the present proposal should be based on the determination to prevent its adoption leading to the dism e- gration of Persia, and all our efforts should be directed towards making the line a means of strengthening the authority of the Persian Government. IB. Assuming that we enter into the project only on the above under standing, we can now consider the more important problem, i.e. ; What effect will the existence of the proposed line have on our position in India ? Given assurance of perpetual continuance of amicable rela onswith Russia, the question hardly needs reply. We must, however, consider also the possible future contingency of hostility with Russia. A railway line lead ing from an enemy’s country, distant though that may be, undoubtedly intro duces sources of danger to which we are unaccustomed. As indicated 'm the previous remarks, the extent of the danger largely depends on the previous effect of the line on the autonomy of Persia. The proposed line moreover introduces a new factor into the problem; for Germany will have doubtless acquired access to this same line from Baghdad. It is possible to conceive conditions under which the new element might add an additional source of danger to ourselves from the new line, but it is, I think, more reasonable to suppose that it will greatly minimise future danger, because the antagonism of German and Turkish interests with those of Russia is likely both to avert hostility between Russia and ourselves, and, in the event of hostilities, to render the Persian line of less assistance and value to Russia than it might otherwise be. In the event of a combination of Russia, Germany, and Turkey against us, it would be hard to overestimate the menace which the Persian line presents to us, but at this stage it would seem superfluous to com plicate the problems of the proposed line with those of Armageddon, and it should suffice to continue to deal with this question on more familiar lines. 14. It may be assumed that we will have constructed at least one branch line from the Persian coast to meet the central line and this fact, in conjunc tion with the long length of the line from Baku or Enzeli, will deprive it of many attractions to Russia for military purposes against India. Again, and this is a still more important factor, the same line nearer India will have converted an important strategic point from being a grave source of danger into a place of great advantage to ourselves. I refer to Seistan. As long as Seistan is left as it is now, equi-distant from the nearest Russian and British garrisons, it must ever remain an attractive objective and a source of temptation to Russia, and a danger to ourselves. The con struction of the proposed railway line will bring us within such easy reach of it as to destroy all Russian hopes of its easy acquisition. Being no longer in the line of least resistance, it will lose its attractions to Russia and its danger to ourselves. On the other hand, Seistan, with its important strategic position with regard to Persia and the Helmand, would be at our disposal, and its great local resources would enable us to place there, when necessity arises, a force sufficiently large to render access to India by rail both difficult and dangerous. Prom a military-political point of view therefore, the proposed railway line does not seem an unmixed evil or one which should be avoided on military grounds at the expense of other important considerations. 15. Afghanistan has so far been omitted from these remarks, but a word is necessary on tne Afghan aspect of the question. The line will affect Afghanistan only from the military aspect and in proportion to the menace it represents to that country from Russia. We cannot expect Afghanistan to i be pleased with railway or any other arrangements we may jointly make with Russia, as suspicion of Russia must tend to give them a significance hostile to Afghanistan. Apart from this, there is but little in the proposed project which will alarm the Afghan Government. The desirability of our improving communications in order to co-operate in the defence of Western Afghanistan has already been clearly recognised by them. The position of the proposed line with regard to Seistan and thereby to the Herat-Kandahar route will, I consider, outweigh in the official Afghan mind any additional menace from Russia through Southern Persia. 16. Of the numerous minor difficulties which the present proposal will bring to the front, the one which will probably give most trouble is that of guage. Assuming that neither Russia nor ourselves will allow the other to 1 use their standard guage, it follows that some neutral guage will have to be \ decided upon. This involves a break of guage at both ends of the Persian line and incidentally increases the difficulty of finding a suitable place for the entry of the line into British territory. The requirements of a large Railway terminus, establishment, staff, &amp;c., in supplies and water are not easily met on the Indo-Persian border]6 and it Will probably '//e ot° Seton'^a^or to 'run a ebor^branc^line^northwards to that placel to supply the juuetiou where our Bailway systems will meet. . 17 In the above remarks I have endeavoured to state as impartially as nobble the merits and ^advantages of the proposed railway. The conclusion Twlrich I have amved is that the connection of the European and Indian -Railwav svstems is inevitable; that the disadvantages and dangers are not of Railway systems is deelinin°’ to take this opportunity of entering into ^ 1 X 0 ^ by' mutoarigr™? on amicable aS thereby favourable toms and that therefore we should give the proposal a favourable reception The time at my disposal has been so short that I am conscious that the above remarks must be considered as a somewhat crude and madequate treat- ment of so important and complex a question. • xi • 18. The following is a brief summary of the arguments advanced in tins letter and the main conclusions arrived at It is unwise to expect that the present isolation of Persia can longer con tinue or that we can indefinitely maintain freedom for India from intercom- muuication by rail from the West. The present proposal offers opportunities of a mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and 1 if we decline to take advantage of it, we may be compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway connection under less favourable condi tions. The proposed railway must benefit Russian trade in much larger proper- tion than British trade, but it will benefit Indian trade and largely increase the bulk of both British and Indian trade by the opening up of Bersia. It will increase the receipts of Indian Railways and thereby benefit In lan revenues. _ . The military or political disadvantages of inter-railway communication are less than might at first sight be supposed, and are largely counteracted by the access afforded by the line to Seistan. These conclusions are arrived at on the assumption that our efforts are directed to preventing the line destroying the autonomy of Persia. On the above grounds the proposal merits favourable reception, but ni order to minimize the preliminary advantages of Russia,^ to assist Bn is trade, prevent Russia getting an undue start of both British and Indian trade, and for strategic purposes it is absolutely essential; (1) To construct a line under British control, from Bandar Abbas or other Gulf port to the central line. (2) That the Indian Railway system be extended to the Indo-Persian border by the easiest and quickest route, i.e., from Nushki. (3) That work on (1) and also from the Indo-Persian border westwards should commence simultaneously with that at the Russian end. (4) That work on (2) be pushed on with speed without necessarily waiting for the commencement of the Persian line. (5) That a line be constructed in due course from Karachi to meet the central line within British limits. (6) That no time be lost in commencing the necessary railway surveys for all the above lines.India Office, London, 4th November 1910. ^ Secret, No. 32.

Extracts from a Memorandum marked “ With, privilege of Manuscript. Most Confidential,” drawn up by the Russian Consortium, on the question of the Persian Railway. (Communicated by Professor Pares, 9th August 1910.) Ihese extracts were made by me at the request and with the help of M. N. A. Ilomyakoff, a member of the Consortium, and are accompanied by his comments.' 1 ' He has sent a similar summary to M. Stolypin. In the^ construction of a railway in Persia may be seen not an object complete m itself, but simply a means of realising a task incomparably greater, namely, the construction of a world route to unite by one continuous line of rails Europe to India and other countries in the far east • *. • • E may be pointed out that on the strategic side the railway will secure not only Russia’s position in Turkey, but also our position in western Trans-Caucasia, and will allow us to curtail the large^ sums which we might have to spend on the defence of our Turkish frontier! . . . . The nearest approach to a positive settlement of the question was made in 1889, when the preliminary agreement of the Ceisian Government was obtained to the construction of a railway from Northern Persia to the Bay of Chakhbar.! In this plan took part M. S. M. 1 retyakoff, Baron P. L. Korff, M. S. E. Palashkovsky, and M. N. A. Homyakoff . . . . Now there are three new factors: {a) the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 ; (b) the proposed construction by Germany of the Bagdad Railway, and especially certain conditions of this scheme ; and (c) the fact that in March expires the Russo-Persian Railway Agreement .... The hostility between England and Germany is an obstacle to the construction of a railway to India by any other road .... We must find a way of action which can scatter the last doubts of the English. The initiative must certainly not come from the Government, but from a group which in the eyes of Englishmen offer every guarantee, both on the business side and on the political .... As to direction, one could hardly expect the English to agree to the continuation of our line from Kushk, which would also be opposed by Afghanistan. The same partly applies to the const ruction of a line from Merv to Meshed, which would be strategically rather dangerous for the English. It is quite a different matter if + a line is carried right through Persia, for instance, from Baku or* from the nearest station in the Baku section To dispose of any possible difficulties on the English side, we should try to take as much account as possible of the wishes of those Englishmen who will take * All the comments are M. HomyakofPs except where otherwise stated, t The Russian part of the projected world route is all in existence with the exception of the short line from Baku to the Persian frontier. It is required only that the line should be shortened at some points, and that more of it should be doubled. Reachino- the Western frontier of Russia at Alexandrovo, it: runs, in almost a direct line, from London to Bombay, through Warsaw, Kieff, Poltava, and Rostoif-on-Don to Baku.’ The German plans include a branch from near Bagdad to Trebizond, close to the Russo- Turkish frontier. The Russian plan, if executed first, would make it unlikely that either the Trebizond branch or the projected German line to Tehran would get financial support. Russian expenses for the further strengthening of the line Kars-Erivan, would thus be obviated. Ihe construction of the Persian part of the railway is estimated by competent Russian experts to require between three and four years. The number of bridges and tunnels is stated to be insignificant. t England, though then hostile to Russia, would then have had to extend its Indian railway system towards the same point.tlie most active and hearty interest in the matter in conjunction with the point of view of the English Government. Not less important is the principle of the method chosen for financing the enterprise. One could hardly hope for success if one started by dividing the line geographically into a Russian section in the Russian sphere of influence, and an English section in the English sphere'* Such a method will only lead to mutual distrust, to suspicions that the line may be used with martial aims. In general we must flatly oppose the idea that an undertaking of world-wide significance—for instance, the Suez Canal—should be considered as a weapon of local politics. We may assume that such a division would also reflect unfavourably on the financial side of the scheme, which, instead of being a great economic undertaking not requiring any special sacrifice from the Russian Imperial Treasury, would come near the category of expensive political designs. The right thing would be to construct the (whole) line together, admitting one other element, the French, which would be most useful both for balancing the others and from the purely financial and technical points of view. Perhaps it would be possible to give a certain share to the Persians themselves in connection with their indebtedness to Russia and to England! .... It is very probable that the French participators in the scheme would agree to leave their share in the profits of the construction of the line to the Russian factories which live on French capital.^ The same might be said of Russian fuel, in which English capital is so strongly interested .... The making of a direct line through Persia will help to better our relations with Persia, giving to our inter national position in that country a stability which could not be destroyed by any new political combinations. Persia will become convinced that Russia is not returning to her former policy of hindering the construction of railways. Northern Persia has long been a useful market for our export, which was guarded from competition by two measures : (a) prohibition of the transit of foreign goods through Batoum, which cost us more than 150,000/. yearly ; and (6) the preventing of the railway construction (in Persia) . . . The making of the Anglo-Russian Agreement has made it quite possible to create railway and steamboat communication, both for the English in their sphere of influence, and perhaps for others in the neutral zone .... -from Constantinople our Persian market is threatened simultaneously by the railway from Trebizond to the Persian frontier, and by a series of branch lines from the Bagdad Rail way, of which the chief is froni Bagdad to Khanikin, and on to Kermanshah and Tehran, so, to think that we shall always be able to keep our Northern Persian market under a glass case of preventions and abstention from railway construction is to refuse to take account of e ! ent ? • . • • • So the right thing is, independently of the world wide importance of the line, ourselves to go right into Persia, and not to wait passively till foreign goods, coming in from three sides, destroy our monopoly. Apart from that, only by developing the prosperity of Persia can one increase the capacity of the Persian market which is at present very limited. Another class of interests which can be affected by the project is the English steamship companies, especially the Peninsular and Oriental, which carries the Indian mail .... At present the post takes 12|- days froni London (via Brindisi) to Bombay. If a land route cut this down to six or seven days, then of course the steamship companies would have to sacrifice their interests to an evident Imperial advantage (for England). * T1 f ^ions would then have to he capitalised separately and administered separately. Changes trom one system to another would delay transit. t M Kokovtsetf, it appears, approves of this idea. If the Persian debts are to be converted, England and Russia will both be concerned in the matter and the occasion might be taken to interest Persian capital to some small extent in the rail wav scheme X Opinion of M.

But strategically it would hardly be right to carry a wor d route of transit along the Black Sea coast, and later close to the iiirkish frontier ... The construction of the new sections would considerably delay the execution of the plan This also applies to a possible variant: Rostoff, Vladikavkaz, Tiflis, Tabreez \ \ . A line would have to be made over a pass with a tunnel. It would be very expensive and difficult, especially for two rails, and it would take not less than ten years .... The line Rostoff-Baku, besides bein^ me shortest, has many other advantages. It is strategically defended” in Russia it only lacks a short line to the Persian frontier It passes along particularly well-served lines. Besides that, it is of extreme advantage that our trade, as far as Baku or Enzeli, can use a waterway. ALL the jreights of the Volga will thus get a considerable advantage over foreign goods over a great part of Persia.^ The further distances are : — Versts.

The nearest point of the British-Indian system is Nnshki, from whence the English arc carrying a railroad to Seistan. It would therefore he best of all to take our line from Tehran to Kirman, according to the plan of S. E. Palashkovsky and to subsequent investigations, and thence to Nushki. This is technically the easiest land from northern Persia to southern, and, according to the calculations of the engineer Sakhansky, it is the cheapest .... Passenger Traffic .—“ The chief factor .... wrote Palash kovsky, “ is in the closeness of the tie between the two respective populations.” . . . . Since 1888 the trade relations of Europe with Asia and Australia have considerably increased . . . The population of Australia has in the last 20 years almost doubled . . . . In 1887 about 50,000 passengers went through the Suez Canal in the year .... Last year the figure was 116,000 .... We should scarcely exaggerate in reckoning on 60,000 first-class passengers at the time when the railway is opened. The number of second-class passengers might be estimated at one-third of this number, that is, at 20,000. Time of Transit.—At 42 versts (26 miles) an hour, allowing for the journey from London to Calais, the 8,250 versts (5,1.56 miles) from London to Bombay would take 8 days 6 hours ; at 45 versts (28 miles) an hour, 7 days 18 hours; at 50 versts (31 miles) an hour, exactly 7 days. At 45 versts an hour, as compared with the maximum speed of transit by Calais, Brindisi, and Peninsular and Oriental, 4-|- days will be saved ... If at the same speed as engaged by the Bagdad Railway the passage would take less than 6 days. Cost .—To the Russian frontier the first-class passenger from London will pay about 73 roubles. To the Persian frontier .... he will pay 74 roubles. On the Indian railways the price would not be more than 35 roubles .... This would give a total (exclusive of the Persian line) of 182 roubles. The remaining items would be . . . . through Persia, 150-3,- roubles ; extra payment for the through communi cation and for express service in Persia and in India, 60 roubles. The whole cost of a first-class ticket from London to Bombay would be 3924 roubles (411. 6s.). Of every 400 roubles 217J would go to the profit of the Persian Railway. The total cost is found to be less than even the half of the present return ticket from London to Bombay, which for passengers direct through Brindisi is from 810 to 900 roubles. We must yet take into account the passengers’ food, .... but there would be no difficulty in including this sum on the ticket, which would then cost 425 roubles, including a special passport or certificate for the passage through Russia .... The second-class ticket may be calculated at 234 roubles (24L 12s.), that is 28 roubles less than half the return ticket from London to Bombay via Marseilles, and 116 roubles cheaper than the single ticket .... As to third-class passengers no calculation can be made .... Germany sent her relief force to Kiaw Chow by land through Siberia. Perhaps with time land communication might be utilised for India too. Trade, Russia and Persia .—The present exchange by the Russian official statistics is from 15*9 to 17‘7 million poods yearly, with a value of 48,000,000 to 56,000,000 roubles. Of this, more than 80 per cent, goes by the Caspian. . . . The making of this line will certainly .... start a trade in Russian products in India and other countries of the Far East, India, and Persia. The trade between these countries is now about 10,000,000 roubles yearly ; the whole trade of Persia with the British Empire is 35,000,000 roubles yearly (about 7,000,000 poods) The cost of transport in Persia is at present very high, and is a heavy burden on trade .... The goods conveyed bycaravan roads run considerable risks. Large dues are taken by the internal customs. A carrying trade of 3,000,000 poods (less than half of ttie whole) will be no exaggerated estimate for the first years of working. loducts of warm countries: “Ao protectionist policy” wrote S. E. Jraiasnkovsky, t£ can enable us to produce in Russia what only grows in the &lt;t tro P lcs ' our population, which needs products of hoi climate, will never be able to get them m any other way than by international trade*” • • • f gieat part of the goods which we receive from India, the Dutch ast Indies, other countries at Far Asia, and Australia, come through roreign middlemen to whom we pay every year miliions of roubles ss commission. Even one-third of its tea import Russia receives from Ur eat Britain and Germany _ One of the effects is that the balance or trade on our Asiatic frontier is always against us, and to very large amounts, for instance, in 1907 more than 20,000.000 roubles. A early all our cotton, kerosene, and tea (except what comes through Ivyakhta) pomesAo us by sea; ... . this trade depends on the s ups leceivmg full freights. In articles of small weight and high value at present we cannot develop any trade by sea with several countries of t re 1 ar East • . . . The import to Russia of groceries 'and other llot climates &gt; excluding what come from Persia, amounts to 40,000 000 poods yearly _. . ^ . . With the introduction of railways through Persia, the quantity of such imports from Persia and India will increase at the expense of the imports from America and elsewhere. In the last few years the trade between Russia and British India amounted to 2o, 000,000 roubles. I he direct import of Indian goods to Russia has risen from 3,600,000 roubles in 1904-05 to 6,500,000 roubles in 1908-09. .These aie the English figures ; according to our official statistics, the import of goods from East India averages more than 15,000,000 roubles yearly . . . The railway should carry 10,000,000 poods very soon . . . Petroleum, it is suggested, should pass through a special conductor ... In the last five years the Indian gold and silver import has varied from 160,000,000 to 300,000,000 roubles yearly and the export from 40,000,000 to 100,000,000 . . . From 1904 to 1909, the average exchange between Europe and India has been 200,000,000 Since 1888 the amount has increased fourfold, and the railway can count on such a trade of 200,000,000 roubles. There has been the same enormous increase in the mails, ... It must be remembered that the projected railway will not only accelerate postal communication but will make it possible to send the mails daily instead of weekly. Bearing in mind the considerable registration of the post and of precious metals, it would hardly be wrong to count on 2 , 000,000 roubles clear profit, apart from the use which will be made of the land- route for sending gold to or from Australia. On all the above data we may base the following table of the possible profits of the line :— Income. Roubles. From 60,000 first-class passengers at 217 r. 50 c.

Before any responsible estimate is made, authorities in Paris and Belgium, as less primarily concerned, should be asked to criticise all the financial details.Letter from M. A. Bunge to M.

' M. 1 immazeff lias come back from London, and lias joined our Consortium In London lie saw Count Benckenkorff, wlio expressed ins sympathy with_ our plan and promised his assistance; he also expressed the opinion that the diplomatic conversations in London should be begun only when Sir C. Hardinge has reached'the place of his new post, and after a closer study of the Indian side can speak more authoritatively m favour of making a Persian railway. In London financial circles, M Timmazeff did not speak of our plan; and in general he thinks that communications with the English banks should take place with the help of the French banks, which will otherwise say that they have been passed over, and this might later have a bad effect on the financing of the enterprise. Anyhow we have more acquaintances and connections amongst the French diplomatists and bankers than amongst the English. So the French can give us the best advice precisely as to what financial groups we should approach in England, in oroer to avoid touching the financial circles interested in the Bagdad Kail way, and also they can show us the methods of approach which will be most successful with the English. In any case, the summer vacation has already began m London and will last till October, s 0 that hist now no business can be done there. . This is also tlle opinion of M. P. L. Bark, who thinks the right course is now to approach M. Noetzlin in Paris. i ,J n iV a ! k ^! I1C - M ‘ Bark liad Wlt]l Mirza Ali Goli Khan, before the tatter left lor I ersia,- it appeared that he was very disposed to help our plan; but, m view of present opinion in Persia, he advises that the Liture company should officially be, not Anglo-Russian, but either Trench, Belgian, or international, with a directorate not established either in Russia or in England. On 4 lid ay the 9th July (22), the members of the Consortium who are on the spot (MM. Timiriazeff, Bark, Pechkovsky, Palashkovsky, and myself) met at the Russian Bank in M. Timiriazeff’s room, and, after exchanging opinions on the above ideas, decided to put off the visit to England till October meanwhile, M. Bark will now go to Paris to learn what is the disposition of 4 rench diplomatic and financial circles towards our plan, and in general to make the necessary enquiries and prepare the ground for the later negotiations in London. M : Bark expressed his willingness to go. The meeting desired me to tell you all this, and to ask you to give me your opinion on the resolution which we adopted. Perhaps you may have objections to raise, or you. might agree to accompany M. Bark to Paris to help him with your friends and connections. M. Timiriazeff and I will start on the 1st August (14) on a journey of some time abroad, and so we should like to have an answer from you as soon as possible. I am sending a copy of this letter to M. A. I. Zvegintseff; perhaps he too will like to take part in the journey. A week ago I was with M. V. N. Kokovtseff and gave him a memorandum and a map. He said that he had long been awaiting this memorandum, for he is very interested in our work. He, however, says that any direct guarantee of capital is impossible ; but to the formation of a guarantee fund started by a sum from the supplementary profits of the Russian railways he is ready to agree. M. Bark thinks such a fund insufficient to raise the capital, but I am less pessimistic on this point. M. Kokovtseff has no doubt of the possibility of the financing of our plan, but he fears diplomatic difficulties; he also recommends that attention should be given to Moscow* (the probable complaint that Russia will lose markets The application to M. Schlesinger was the best way of meeting this difficulty.mmtm in Northern Persia). In a few days is expected here M Sehlesinger, president of the Moscow Commercial Bank ; and M. Bark has piomised to bring; him into our Consortium. , . 1£ 4 few days ago I had a talk with Sakhansky. He puts himself entirely at oui'disposal. We think of putting him on our Consortium if only the absent members consent. M. \. N. 1 echkovsky has put at mv disposal 5.000 roubles for the expenses of the Consortium, and M Bark has written to tell me that he holds at my disposal a similar amount for the same object. M. Bark has sent to M. L. H. Nobel an mutation to join the Consortium, but he has as yet received no answer. M. Nobel is abroad. With all best wishes, . I am, yours very sincerely, A. Bunge. Letter from M. P. L. Bark to M. Homyakoff. Dear M. Homyakoff, _ . &lt; ^ r From my talks with the Persian Charge d Allanes, All C&lt;oli Khan, it appears that in Persia there would be g’reat difficulty in getting' a railway concession if the application came from an Fnglish o i Kussian company. The present Anglo-Russian agreement makes the Persians extremely distrustful of anything that comes just now from Russia or Great Britain, and therefore, in the opinion of AR Goli Khan, it would he more expedient to start a neutral international company (French or Belgian), which would have a better chance of getting the concession. It goes without saying that m this company i epi esentativeb of both nationalities (English and Russian) could also invest theii capital, and also join the board of directors.* * * § ' In view of this, at a conference held a few days ago at the house or M. 1 imiriazeff, it was proposed to first feel the ground in Paris, in order that, when the co-operation of the biggest men there has been secured, we should then turn to London. There was also expressed a desire that I should visit Paris as soon as possible to see the French bankers.j* io-day, however, M. Kokovtseff, in a talk with me on the affairs of my hank, himself turned the convervation to railway making in Persia, and, after listening to what 1 had to say on the subject, explained that he thinks that the time has not come for a visit to Paris, as the whole question has yet to he elucidated by our Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked M. Kokovtseff’s opinion, which is being prepared in the Department of Railway Business and in the General Chancellery of the Minister (of Finance), and will be given, so the Minister of Finance thinks, in a favourable sense in a week and a half. However, in view of the extreme importance of the question, the Minister of Finance thinks it essential to bring up the question for discussion in the special Persian conference on the return of M. Stolypin,J and under his presidency, with the Ministers of Finance, Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs, War, and the Navy, M. Kokovtseff thinks that it is only in this last stage that the question will he finally elucidated,§ and then it will be possible to proceed to its * No. The enterprise should he An glo -Franco - Russian. I am for open doors ; any one might come into the Persian railway, hut the two ends of the line will hold it, and others can do nothing. Transit is the real significance ; we cannot give it all over to the French and Belgians. The fears of Persian distrust are exaggerated ; the Persians were hostile to Russia and England when both countries were stopping them from making railways there. Some Persian reactionaries may talk now, but that is all. There is no need to start with concessions; that can be done later. So M. Homyakoff; but M. Timirazeff agrees with M. Bark. t I agree to sounding Paris first, i.e., to consulting, but not to making a Consortium there before one is made in London. The only sound plan for Anglo-Russian relations is to make the first Consortium in London and then to ask the French to join.—N.A.H. X I have sent to M. Stolypin the memorandum and a detailed letter, so he will know all before the permanent Persian conference discusses the subject. § Yes; it is only there that the question can be settled; but we must first know that we can get money ; i.e., M. Bark should go to Paris first (he will now soon do so). * MMjpMIMhTwn 0 ^ 111 !^ 4 ' Koko y tseff P romised me Aat the question should oe brought before the conference immediately on the return of M. fetolypin, who is expected in the middle of August. Perhaps this delay will not do any particular harm to the business, if we remember that the chief financiers both of Paris and of London are a\jay, and being on their holidays, will not much care to take up a bio- attair, so that discussion would naturally be postponed till autumn.

Hoviyakoff may come to England for a month in the autumn— e.g., from 15th September. He conceives the matter to be an entirely private affair, but one that needs the approval of both Governments, and must be carried out in the common interests of both. States. He there fore thinks it most desirable that both Governments should know, quite informally and quite privately, how the project is proceeding. The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Secretary of the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade, and is directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to him herewith copy of a paper communicated to this Of lice by Professor Bernard Pares, of the University of Liverpool, containing extracts, in translation, of a memorandum drawn up by M. Homyakoff, formerly President of the Russian Duma, with regard to a scheme for the construction of a railway destined to connect Europe with India and the Far East by way of Persia. Lord Hardinge of Penshurst is to request that the Branch will furnish their views as to the commercial aspects of the scheme from the point of view of British trade, and that a reply may be returned to this com munication with all convenient speed in order that Sir E. Grey may be enabled to discuss the question with Professor Pares during the course of next week. I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the note addressed from your department to the Director of their Commercial Intelligence Branch on the 16th August, enclosing print of a paper relating to a scheme for the construction of a railway destined to connect Europe with India and the Far East by way of Persia. In reply, I am to forward to you the accompanying copy of a memo randum which has been prepared by the Director of the Intelligence Branch respecting this matter, and to state that the Board agree generally with the observations contained therein.

The Board assume that there is little likelihood of either the Indian or the Home Government offering such i guarantee. ° a I am, &amp;c., W. F. Mar wo od. Annex. Memorandum respecting the Persian Railway. T he route favoured in the memorandum, on which the estimate of cost on page 6 is based, is that from Baku to Seistan, and it is apparently the best for connecting the Russian and Indian railway systems. The precise route is not stated, but I gather the line would run from Baku along the coast to Resht (population 42,000), thence it would follow moie or less, the Russian road to Tehran (population 28,000), thence theLyncli road to Ivuin (population 35,000), thencG to 1\aslian, tlien, leaving Ispahan (population 70,000) to the right, by hi a in to Yezd (population 4,500 according to Consul, but 60,000 according to Mr. Gleadowe- Newcomen !), thence to Kerman (population 60,000 according to Consul, but 90,000 to 100,000 according to Mr. Gleadowe-Newcomen), and across the desert to Seistan. As to the feasibility of this route, I understand a carriage road could probably be made without difficulty along the coast from Baku to Resht, and that from Resht to Kerman the existing roads can be negotiated by a fourgon, although in die ascent from the coast to Tehran the gradients are as high as 1 in 10 or 12. The estimated cost of 85,000 roubles per verst, ^ or about 13,500Z. per mile, seems ample. In the United States 6,000Z, per mile is a kind of average figure, taking rough and smooth, but not all mountain, of course, for a single line over a long distance. The India Office will probably have figures of cost of somewhat similar lines to the one in question. The statement of estimated results is very difficult to value ; any such estimates must involve a good deal of guesswork. Passengers would probably be the mainstay of the line j it would be ^ ery difficult to estimate what the amount of freight earned on goods might be. I notice the rate estimated to be obtained on goods for transit through Persia is nearly 37s. 6d. per ton, and if the rates, say from Allahabad (to take a central point) to Seistan be added on the Indian side, and the rate from Baku to London on the European side, the total figure would be such as to preclude all but the most costly class of merchandise from being carried in through traffic. The competition of the overland route from London to Constantinople is hardly felt, I understand, by the sea route, and rates for such goods as might use it are much more than double the sea rates. Probably, however, the figures of the Trans- Siberian Railway, if obtainable, would form a better guide as to what might be expected on a through line to India. Doubtless there would always be a certain amount of specially valuable goods to be taken to India, and a certain amount of such goods to be brought from India, which would avail of a quick route, even at a high cost. Coming to the actual questions as to the commercial aspects of the scheme from the point of view of British trade, the following figures are submitted, viz. :— Russian Trade with Persia (from Persian Returns). The following are the latest figures of Russian trade with Persia :— Exports from Russia in 1907— By Russo-Persian frontier By Caucasus-Caspian frontier By Astrakan By Central Asian-Persian frontier - Total exports from Russia to Persia in 1907 - Imports into Russia in 1907— By Russo-Persian frontier By Caucasus-Caspian frontier By Astrakan By Central Asian-Persian frontier - Total imports into Russia from Persia in 1907 1,000 Ponds.

The advantage to British and Indian trade of a quick mail and passenger route to India would no doubt be considerable, but as regards goods it would be of minor importance (at least as regards British trade), for the reason that has been indicated in the foregoing. To Russian trade with India it would be of greater advantage than to British, for Russia is at present for practical purposes as far off from India as England, whereas by the all-rail route she would be much nearer than England. The following are the latest figures (from Russian returns) of total Russian trade with India :— 1907. 1,000 ponds. Tons.

S. 35. BProbably, however, it is rather from the opening up of Persia which would be caused by the railway than from the more rapid communication with India that British trade, as a whole, would benefit. Persia is a sparsely populated country, it is true, with vast areas of mountain and desert; nevertheless, she has a total trade with the outside world (figures for the year ending the 20th March 1909), of over 12,500,00OZ., viz. : — £ Imports into Persia _ _ - 6,692,000 Exports from Persia - - 6,097,000 and it is impossible to suppose that the coming of the railway would not have a similar effect in Persia to that which it has had in other pre viously little developed countries, namely, to increase the existing trade by the vastly improved and possibly cheaper transit facilities, to build up new trades by the development of the resources of the country, and, with a stable and enlightened Government, to enable more effective control to be exercised over unruly natives. As regards development of the resources of the country, it may be that there are in Persia localities, probably not a few r , where agriculture might be extended by irrigation ; while prospecting for minerals has, I take it, yet to be undertaken systematically on modern lines. Coal, it may be observed, is reported “ abundant ” in the Kerman district, but not “ dug. It may be argued, and no doubt with reason, that the development of Persia to the south by a railway from the north would benefit Russian more than British or other trade. If, therefore, the Seistan route be chosen, a connecting line to the coast, either from Khum to Ahwaz and Mohammerah, Kum to Ispahan, Shiraz, and Bushire, or Kerman to Bander Abbas, should be made a sine qua non. With one of these lines made, however, British trade, with its cheap ocean freight, should benefit as much as Russian. Indian trade with Persia, all except a small percentage, goes by sea, and should benefit greatly by a railway to the Gulf, although possibly not quite so much as by linking up the proposed Persian railway with the Indian system. Any of the lines to connect the proposed central line to Kerman with the coast would be very expensive, and if it comes to a simple question whether the central line is to be connected with the Indian railway system or with the Gulf, the latter would seem the most desirable alternative to adopt, except perhaps from the point of view of Indian trade with Russia. Chakbar is described as a good port, but it is much further from Kerman than is Bunder Abbas, and the route is through a good deal of desert; still it might on fuller investigation be found acceptable in case of need as an alternative to one of the well known Gulf ports. 25th August 1910. T- \\. Enclosure No. 4, Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey. No. 380. (Confidential). St. Petersburgh, Sir, 17th September 1910. I said yesterday to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that I supposed there was no truth in the recent rumours as to the negotiation of a military convention between Turkey and Germany and Austria. M. Sazonow said that he did not believe in the conclusion of a military convention. Turkey would, in his opinion, not incur the ill-will of Great Britain and Russia by taking such a step. But he thought that there had been conversations between her and the two central European Powers with regard to railways in Asia Minor. He suspected that this matter had been touched on by Hakki Pasha in Marienbad and by Djavid Bey in Berlin, and he appeared to think that Austria had acted as an intermediary between the other two powers.His Excellency said that his principal reason for fancying that something of the kind indicated had been taking place was the attitude assumed by the Turkish Government in the question of the Samsun- Sivas railway. Russia and France had been moving for the concession for this railway, of which Russia held the option as against any Power other than Turkey herself. The Ottoman Government had made diffi culties about granting a concession, expressing an intention of constructing the line themselves. In reality it was Germany that desired to include this line in her Anatolian railway system, and M. Sazonow suspected that a plan was in contemplation by which Germany would finance the construction of the railway, which would be nominally undertaken by the Turkish Government, The position taken up by Russia was that Turkey was at liberty to build the railway if she could find the means required for so doing “ within the limits of her budget.” M. Sazonow remarked to me that the Samsun-Sivas railway had a certain importance, but it was as nothing compared to that of a trans- Persian line which would connect the Russian and the British-Indian systems. That, he said, was the real counter-move to make to the Bagdad Railway scheme, but he feared that Anglo-Indian opinion was not yet ripe for it. He was far from underrating the value of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907. That was “a great thing” accomplished, but his Excellency gave me to understand that it would, in his opinion, never yield the full value of which it was capable until it was completed by the adoption of the trans-Persian railway scheme, which would, he said, reduce the Bagdad line to a position of entire insignificance.

[September 14.] Section 3. [33431] No. 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received September 14.) (Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, September 13, 1910. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the note addressed from- yonr department to the director of their Commercial Intelligence Branch on the 16th. August, enclosing print of a paper relating to a scheme for the construction of a railway destined to connect Europe with India and the Far East by way of Persia. In reply, I am to forward to you the accompanying copy of a memorandum which has been prepared by the director of the Intelligence Branch respecting this matter,* and to state that the Board agree generally with the observations contained therein. The Board desire me to state, however, for Sir E. Grey’s information, that in their opinion the scheme in question is of a very speculative character and has been put- forward mainly in Russian interests. They think with Mr. Worthington, that the estimate of cost which has been mentioned allows a sufficient margin for dealing with the difficulties of the proposed route (which they take to be that referred to in the enclosed memorandum), but they would point out that so little is really known of the economic conditions and possibilities of development of Central Persia that any estimate of the revenue likely to be earned by the suggested railway must be largely conjectural. In any event, while Russian trade would probably be considerably benefited by the construction of such a line as that proposed—and possibly Indian trade also in a less degree—United Kingdom trade would probably not be benefited by it to any material extent, at any rate for a long time after its opening. The possibility, indeed, might ha^e to be faced that the expansion of Russian trade in the interior of Persia might take place at the expense of purely United Kingdom trade. The Board doubt the probability of much of the Australian export of goods and bullion availing itself of the proposed new route whether it were made to connect with the Indian railway system or to have its terminus at one of the Gulf ports. They agree with Mr. Worthington’s view that so far as regards through traffic, the transport of passengers would probably form the bulk of the business of such a line, though even here the powerful competition of the sea route would always remain to be contended against. As regards through goods traffic, whether to the Far East, to Australasia, or to the Persian Gulf littoral, they do not think that the railway route would be utilised to any appreciable extent, involving as it would additional handling and greater cost, as well as a sense of insecurity until such time as it would be possible for a stable and enlightened Government to be established in Persia. As regards the effect of the proposed railway on British trade with Persia, whick is mainly carried on through the Persian Gulf ports, the board consider that the result, would probably be to the disadvantage of British as compared with Russian trade unless the scheme included a line connecting Kerman with the Gulf. Such a line would possess solid advantages for British commercial interests, though it would be costly to construct, and the extent to which it would prove remunerative be doubtful. It would, however, appear essential that the control of any branch to the Gulf should be predominantly British, in view of the paramount British interests in the Persian Gulf. It is assumed, of course, that in the event of a railway being constructed in Persia connecting with the European system, specific stipulations would be insisted upon for equal facilities and charges in all respects for British passengers and goods with. Russian passengers and goods. If these two conditions be fulfilled, viz., a line from Kerman to the Gulf in the control of which British influence should predominate, and equal facilities for all throughout the whole railway, the Board think that His Majesty’s Government might adopt an attitude of benevolent neutrality towards the scheme. The Board, however, doubt if, from a commercial point of view, the scheme is for the present likely to prove a success or to attract the investing public, unless the British, Indian, or Russian Governments, or the three jointly, are prepared to offer a guarantee of a certain minimum return on the capital embarked. The Board assume that there is little likelihood of either the Indian or the Home Government offering such a guarantee. I am, &amp;c. W. F. MARWOOD.2 Enclosure in No. 1.

THE route favoured in the memorandum, on which the estimate of cost on p. 5 is based, is that from Baku to Seistan, and it is apparently the best for connecting the Bussian and Indian railway systems. The precise route is not stated, but I gather the line would run from Baku along the coast to Resht (population 42,000), thence it would follow, more or less, the Russian road to Tehran (population 28,000), thence the Lynch road to Kum (population 35,000), thence to Kashan, then, leaving Ispahan (population 70,000) to the right, by Nain to Yezd (population 4,500 according to consul, but 60,000 according to Mr. Gleadowe-Newcomen !), thence to Kerman (population 60,000 according to consul, but 90,000 to 100,000 according to Mr. Gleadowe-Newcomen), and across the desert to Seistan. As to the feasibility of this route, I understand a carriage road could probably be made without difficulty along the coast from Baku to Resht, and that from Resht to Kerman the existing loads can be negotiated by a fourgon, although in the ascent from the coast to Tehran the gradients are as high as 1 in 10 or 12.

That was “ a great thing ” accomplished, but his Excellency gave me to understand that it would, in his opinion, never yield the full value of which it was capable until it was completed by the adoption of the trans-Persian railway scheme, which would, he said, reduce the Bagdad line to a position of entire insignificance.

Extracts from a Memorandum marked “ With 'privilege of Manuscript Most Confi dential,” drawn up by the Russian Consortium, on the questio?i of the Persian Railway.—{Communicated by Professor Pares, August 9, 1910.) THESE extracts were made by me at tbe request and with, tbe help of M. N. A. Homyakoff, a member of tbe Consortium, and are accompanied by his comments. # He has sent a similar summary to M. Stolypin. In the construction of a railway in Persia may be seen not an object complete in itself, but simply a means of realising a task incomparabiy greater, namely, the construction of a world route to unite by one continuous line of rails Europe to India and other countries in the Far East It may be pointed out that on the strategic side the railway will secure not only Russia’s position in Turkey, but also our position in western Trans-Caucasia, and will allow us to curtail the large sums which we might have to spend on the defence of our Turkish frontier. ] .... The nearest approach to a positive settlement of the question was made in 1889, when the preliminary agree ment of the Persian Government was obtained to the construction of a railway from Northern Persia to the Bay of Chakhbar. 2 In this plan took part M. S. M. Tretyakoff, Baron P. L. Korff, M. S. E. Palashkovsky, and M. N. A. Homyakoff Now there are three new factors: (a) the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, (b) the proposed con struction by Germany of the Bagdad Railway, and specially certain conditions of this scheme; and (c) the fact that in March expires the Russo-Persian Railway Agree ment, .... Tim hostility between England and Germany is an obstacle to the construction of a railway to India by any other road We must find a way of action which can scatter the last doubts of the English. The initiative must certainly not come from the Government, but from a group which in the eyes of Englishmen offered every guarantee both on the business side and on the political As to direction, one could hardly expect the English to agree to the continuation of our line from Kushk, which would also be opposed by Afghanistan. The same partly applies to the construction of a line from Merv to Meshed, which would be strategically rather dangerous for_ the English. It is quite a different matter if a line is carried right through Persia, for instance, from Baku or from the nearest station in the Baku section To dispose of any possible difficulties on the English side, we should try to take as much account as possible of the wishes of those Englishmen who will take the most active and hearty interest in the matter in conjunction with the point of view of the English Government. Not less important is the principle of the method chosen for financing the enterprise. One could hardly hope for success if one started by dividing the line geographically into a Russian section in the Russian sphere of influence, and an English section in the English sphere. 3 .... Such a method will only lead to mutual distrust, to suspicions that the line may be used with martial aims. In general we must flatly oppose the idea that an undertaking of world-wide significance—for instance, the Suez Canal—should be considered as a weapon of local politics. We may assume that such a division would also reflect unfavourably on the * All the comments are M. Homyakoff’s except where otherwise stated. 1 The Russian part of the projected world route is all in existence with the exception of tbe short line from Baku to the Persian frontier. It is required only that the line should be shortened at some points, and that more of it should be doubled. Reaching the western frontier of Russia at Alexandrovo. it runs, in almost a direct line, from London to Bombay, through Warsaw, Kieff, Poltava, and Rostoff-on-Don to Baku. The German plans include a branch from near Bagdad to Trebizond, close to the Russo-Turkish frontier. The Russian plan, if executed first, would make it unlikely that either the Trebizond branch or the projected German line to Tehran would get financial support. Russian expenses for the further strengthening of the line Kars-Erivan, would thus be obviated. The construction of the Persian part of the railway is estimated j by competent Russian experts to require between three and four years. The number of bridges and tunnels i is stated to be insignificant. 2 England, though then hostile to Russia, would then have had to extend its Indian railway system towards the same point. 3 The sections would then have to be capitalised separately and administered separately. Changes from one system to another would delay transit. [2854 i—1] Bfinancial side of the scheme, which, instead of being a great economic undertaking not requiring any special sacrifice from the Russian Imperial Treasury, would come near the category of expensive political designs. The right thing would be to construct the (whole) line together, admitting one other element, the French, which would be most useful both for balancing the others and from the purely financial and technical points of view. Perhaps it would be possible to give a certain share to the Persians themselves in connection with their indebtedness to Russia and to Fngland. • • • • It is very probable that the French participators in the scheme would agree to leave their share in the profits of the construction of the line to the Russian factories which live on French capital. 0 . x , The same might be said of Russian fuel, m which English capital is so strongly interested The making of a directhne through Persia will help to better our relations with Persia, giving to our international position in that country a stability which could not be destroyed by any new political combinations. Persia will become convinced that Russia is not returning to her former policy of hindering the construction of railways. Northern Persia has long been a useful market for our export, which was guarded from competition by two measures : (a) prohibition of the transit of foreign goods through Batoum, which cost us more than 150,000Z. yearly ; and (b) the preventing of the railway construction (in Persia) The making of the Anglo-Russian agiee- ment has made it quite possible to create railway and steamboat communication, both for the English in their sphere of influence, and perhaps for others in the neutral Z one From Constantinople our Persian market is threatened simultaneously by the railway from Trebizond to the Persian frontier, and by a series of branch-lines from the Bagdad Railway, of which the chief is from Bagdad to Khanikin, and on to Kermanshah and Tehran, So, to think that we shall always be able to keep our Northern Persian market under a glass case of preventions and abstention from railway construction is to refuse to take account of events So the right thing is, independently of the world-wide importance of the line, ourselves to go right into Persia, and not to wait passively till foreign goods, coming in from three sides, destroy our monopoly. Apart from that, only by developing the prosperity of Persia can one increase the capacity of the Persian market, which is at present very limited. Another class of interests which can be affected by the project is the English steam-ship companies, especially the P. and 0., which carries the Indian mail At present the post takes twelve-and-a-half days from London (via Brindisi) to Bombay. If a land route cut this down to six or seven days, then of course the steam-ship companies would have to sacrifice their interests to an evident Imperial advantage (for England). It is on this ground (reasons of State) that the Russian Consortium insists on the quickest possible realisation of its project, which is favoured by the change in the political conditions, and by all the circumstances of the present, and, lastly, by the clear proofs that by the force of things, if we delay, the plan will be executed without us, outside our frontiers, and even in spite [of us 4 5 6 In a few years—from four to seven—the Bagdad Railway Company, that is the German Bank, will bring its line to Bagdad. 7 It is self-evident that after this will arise the question of extending this line (the Khanikin branch) into Persia—if only the question is not settled earlier, and if the German Bank does not decide to proceed wifh this branch simultaneously with the Bagdad Railway (main-line), which would of course considerably shorten the period within which the present project can be realised. How to realise the project. . . . First, we must here notice the important services rendered to the Empire by the late engineer of State Railways, S. E. Palashkovsky, who died in 1910 He stood for a line from Baku to Tehran, and on to the Bay of Chakhbar, on the Indian Ocean. .... Later projects, connected with the investigations of twelve years ago, conducted by the engineer Sakhansky, entertained, besides the above, two other directions : (a) Tehran to Bushire, and (b) Tehran to Bunder Abbas But now the question is not of making a line which can attract transit and later he developed, 4 M. Kokovtseff, it appears, approves of this idea. If the Persian debts are to be converted, England and Russia will both be concerned in the matter, and the occasion might be taken to interest Persian capita to some small extent in the railway scheme. 5 Opinion of M. Pechkovsky and of M. Bunge. 6 Underlined in the original, but printed in italics. 7 The Bagdad line has reached Konieh.*2? , ' : - V ■**xm tmi-sut xzM.hmi iribuic' xtMffki.' i eg ilk® ^BaEi' k but a line for which its importance for transit is its very first consideration. 8 There are five possible directions :— ** As crow flies. Using existing Lines. V ersts. Versts. The Transcaspian 6,447-4 7,955 The Trans-Aral 6,668-1 9,116 Constantinople-Bagdad 6,489-2 8,017 Through Kerch 6,321-8 8,126 Through Rostoff 6.410-5 7,864 The Kerch line would require a bridge over the Straits of Kerch. This line could be shortened by 200 versts by making a railway from Batoum to Kars. But strategically it would hardly be right to carry a world route of transit along the Black Sea coast and later close to the Turkish frontier The construction of the new sections would considerably delay the execution of the plan This also applies to a possible variant: Rostoff, Vladikavkaz, Tiflis, Tabreez A line would have to be made over a pass with a tunnel. It would be very expensive and difficult, especially for two rails, and it would take not less than ten years. . . . The line Rostoff-Baku, besides being the shortest, has many other advantages. It is strategically defended ; in Russia it only lacks a short line to the Persian frontier. It passes along particularly well-served lines. Besides that, it is of extreme advantage that our trade, as far as Baku or Enzeli, can use a waterway. All the freights of the Volga will thus get a considerable advantage over foreign goods over a great 'part of Persiad The further distances are :— Baku to Tehran Tehran to Bunder Abbas Tehran to Bay of Chakhbar Tehran to Karrachee .. Versts. 700 1,200 1,600 2,000 .... The nearest point of the British-Indian system is Nushki, from whence the English are carrying a railroad to Seistan. It would therefore be best of all to take our line from Tehran to Kirman, according to the plan of S. E. Palashkovsky and to subsequent investigations, and thence to Nushki. This is technically the easiest land from northern Persia to southern, and, according to the calculations of the engineer Sakhansky, it is the cheapest Passenger Traffic. —“The chief factor . . . .” wrote Palashkovsky, “is in the closeness of the tie between the two respective populations.” .... Since 1888 the trade relations of Europe with Asia and Australia have considerably increased. . . . The population of Australia has in the last twenty years almost doubled In 1887 about 50,000 passengers went through the Suez Canal in the year Last year the figure was 116,000 We should scarcely exaggerate in reckoning on 60,000 first-class passengers at the time when the railway is opened. The number of second-class passengers might be estimated at one-third of this number, that is, at 20,000. Time of Transit. —At 42 versts (26 miles) an hour, allowing for the journey from London to Calais, the 8,250 versts (5; 156 miles) from London to Bombay would take 8 days, 6 hours; at 45 versts (28 miles) an hour, 7 days, 18 hours; at 50 versts (31 miles) an hour, exactly 7 days. At 45 versts an hour, as compared with the maximum speed of transit by Calais, Brindisi, and P. and O., 4^ days will be saved If at the same speed as engaged by the Bagdad Railway, the passage would take less than 6 days. Cost. —To the Russian frontier the first-class passenger from London will pay about 73 roubles. To the Persian frontier .... he will pay 74 roubles. On the Indian railways the price would not be more than 35 roubles; .... This would give a total (exclusive of the Persian line) of 182 roubles. The remaining items would be ... . through Persia, 1504 roubles ; extra payment for the through communication and for express service in Persia and in India, 60 roubles. The whole cost of a first-class i 8 Everything- else is secondary or auxiliary. 9 Underlined in the original, but printed in italics.4 ticket from London to Bombay would be 392i roubles (41L 6s.). Of every 400 roubles 217-L would go to the profit of tbe Persian Railway. Pbe total cost is found to be less than even tbe half of tbe present return ticket from London to Bombay, which for passengers direct through Brindisi is from 810 to 900 roubles. We must yet take int^k. account the passengers’ food, but there would be no difficulty m including' this sum on the ticket, which would then cost 425 roubles, including a special passport or certificate for the passage through Russia The second class ticket may be calculated at 234 roubles (24Z. 125 .), that is 28 roubles less than half the return ticket from London to Bombay via Marseilles, and 116 roubles cheaper than the single ticket As to third class passengers no calculation can be made. . . ; . Germany sent her relief force to Kiaw Chow by land through Siberia. Perhaps with time, land communication might be utilised for India too. _ . . Trade, Russia and Persia .—The present exchange by the Russian official statistics is from 15*9 to 17*7 million poods yearly, with a value of 48,000,000 to 56,000,000 roubles. Of this, more than 80 per cent, goes by the Caspian. . . . • The making of this line will certainly start a trade in Russian products m India and other countries of the Far East, India and Persia. The trade between these countries is now about 10,000,000 roubles yearly ; the whole trade of Persia with the British Empire is 35.000. 000 roubles yearly (about 7,000,000 poods) The cost of transport in Persia is at present very high, and is a heavy burden on trade The goods conveyed by caravan roads run considerable risks. Large dues are taken by the internal customs. A carrying trade of 3,000.000 poods (less than half of the whole) will be no exaggerated estimate for the first years of working. Products of warm countries : “ No 'protectionist policy ” wrote S. E. Palashkovsky “ can enable us to produce in Russia what only grows in the tropics. Thus our population, which needs products of hot climate, will never be able to get them in any other way than by international trade.” 10 ... . A great part of the goods which we receive from India, the Dutch East Indies, other countries at Far Asia, and Australia, come through foreign middlemen to whom we pay every year millions of roubles as commission. Even one-third of its tea import Russia receives from Great Britain and Germany. • . • • One of the effects is that the balance of trade on our Asiatic frontier is always against us, and to very large amounts, for instance, in 1907 more than 20,000,000 roubles. Nearly all our cotton, kerosene, and tea (except what comes through Kyakhta) comes to us by sea ; this trade depends on the ships receiving full freights. In articles of small weight and high value at present we cannot develop any trade by sea with several countries of the Far East The import to Russia of groceries and other products of hot climates, excluding what comes from Persia, amounts to 40.000. 000 poods yearly With the introduction of railways through Persia, the quantity of such imports from Persia and India will increase at the expense of the imports from America and elsewhere. In the last few years the^ trade between Russia and British India amounted to 25,000,000 roubles. The direct import of Indian goods to Russia has risen from 3,600,000 roubles in 1904-5 to 6,500,000 roubles in 1908-9. These are the English figures ; according to our official statistics, the import of goods from East India averages more than 15,000,000 roubles yearly. • The railway should carry 10,000,000 poods very soon Petroleum, it is suggested, should pass through a special conductor In the last five years the Indian gold and silver import has varied from 160,000,000 to 300,000,000 roubles yearly and the export from 40,000,000 to 100,000,000 From 1904 to 1909, the average exchange between Europe and India has been 200,000,000 1888 the amount has increased fourfold, and the railway can count on such a trade ol 200.000. 000 roubles. There has been the same enormous increase in the mails. . • • • It must be remembered that the projected railway will not only accelerate posta communication, but will make it possible to send the mails daily instead of weekly. . • • • Bearing in mind the considerable registration of the post and of precious metals, i would hardly be wrong to count on 2,000,000 roubles clear profit, apart from the use which wall be made of the land-route for sending gold to or from Australia. On all the above data we may base the following table of the possible profits o the line :— 10 Underlined in the original, but printed in italics.Income.

There is no doubt that the English, will continue their line to Seistan and Kirman Thus there can be no talk of the harm to our trade from the execution of the present project; but we can say the contrary : this project is the only way of helping it, the only strong weapon in the struggle for our commercial interests Cost of Making the Railway.

Timiriazeff has come back from London, and has joined our Consortium. In London he saw Count Benckenkorff, who expressed his sympathy with our plan and promised his assistance ; he also expressed the opinion that the diplomatic conversa tions in London should be begun only when Sir C. Hardinge has reached the place of his new post, and after a closer study of the Indian side can speak more authoritatively in favour of making a Persian railway. In London financial circles, M. Timiriazeff did not speak of our plan ; and in general he thinks that communications with the 11 The subscribed capital should come from the Consortium in each country as finally constituted and from shares taken by the respective Governments. It should be noted that all the above estimates are only put forward as conjectural, and, in all comparisons with similar enterprises, the figures given are deliberately fixed at a disadvantage to the present scheme. Before any responsible estimate is made, authorities in Paris and Belgium, as less primarily concerned, should be asked to criticise all the financial details. [2854 i —1] C6 English banks should take place with the help of the French banks, which will other wise say that they have been passed over, and this might later have a bad effect on the financing of the enterprise. Anyhow we have more acquaintances and connections amongst the French diplomatists and bankers than amongst the English. So th e French can give us the best advice precisely as to what financial groups we should' approach in England, in order to avoid touching the financial circles interested m the Bagdad Railway, and also they can show us the methods of approach which will be most successful with the English. In any case, the summer vacation has already began in London and will last till October, so that just now no business can be done there. This is also the opinion of M. P. L. Bark, who thinks the right course is now to approach M. Noetzlin in Paris. In a talk which M. Bark had with Mirza Ali Goli Khan, before the latter left for Persia, 12 it appeared that he was very disposed to help our plan ; but, in view of present opinion in Persia, he advises that the future company should^ officially be not Anglo- Russian, but either French, Belgian, or international, with a directorate not established either in Russia or in England. On Friday, the 9th July (22), the members of the Consortium who are on the spot (MM. Timiriazeff, Bark, Pechkovsky, Palashkovsky, and myself) met at the Russian Bank in M. Timiriazeff’s room, and, after exchanging opinions on the above ideas, decided to put off the visit to England till October ; meanwhile, M. Bark will now go to Paris to learn what is the disposition of French diplomatic and financial circles towards our plan, and in general to make the necessary enquiries and prepare the ground for the later negotiations in London. M. Bark expressed his willingness to go. The meeting desired me to tell you all this, and to ask you to give me your opinion on the resolution which we adopted. Perhaps you may have objections to raise, or you might agree to accompany M. Bark to Paris to help him with your friends and connections. M. Timiriazeff and I will start on the 1st August (14) on a journey of some time abroad, and so we should like to have an answer from you as soon as possible. I am sending a copy of this letter to M. A. I. Zvegintseff; perhaps he too will like to take part in the journey. A week ago I was with M. V. N. Kokovtseff and gave him a memorandum and a map. He said that he had long been awaiting this memorandum, for he is very interested in our work. He, however, says that any direct guarantee of capital is impossible ; but to the formation of a guarantee fund started by a sum from the supplementary profits of the Russian railways he is ready to agree. M. Bark thinks such a fund insufficient to raise the capital, but I am less pessimistic on this point. M. Kokovtseff has no doubt of the possibility of the financing of our plan, but he fears diplomatic difficulties ; he also recommends that attention should be given to Moscow 12 (the probable complaint that Russia will lose markets in Northern Persia). In a few days is expected here M. Schlesinger, president of the Moscow Commercial Bank ; and M. Bark has promised to bring him into our Consortium. A few days ago I had a talk with Sakhansky. He puts himself entirely at our disposal. We think of putting him on our Consortium, if only the absent members consent. M. V. N. Pechkovsky has put at my disposal 5,000 roubles for the expenses of the Consortium, and M. Bark has written to tell me that he holds at my disposal a similar amount for the same object. M. Bark has sent to M. L. E. Nobel an invitation to join the Consortium, but he has as yet received no answer. M. Nobel is abroad. With all best wishes, I am, yours very sincerely, A. BUNGE. Letter from M. P. L. Bark to M. LLomyakojf. The Director of The Volga-Kama Commercial Bank, St. Petersburgh. Dear M. Homyakoff, July 13 (26), From my talks with the Persian charge d’affaires, Ali Goli Khan, it appears that in Persia there would be great difficulty in getting a railway concession if the application came from an English or Russian company. The present Anglo-Russian 12 The application to M. Schlesinger was the best way of meeting this difficulty. - — - —agreement makes the Persians extremely distrustful of anything that comes just now irom Itnssia or Great Britain, and therefore, in the opinion of Ali Goli Khan, it would be more expedient to start a neutral international company (French or Belgian), which . would have a better chance of getting the concession. It goes without saying that in JJns company representatives of both nationalities (English and Russian) could also invest their capital, and also join the board of directors. 13 In view of this, at a conference held a few days ago at the house of M. Timiriazeff, it was proposed to first teei me ground m Pans, m order that, when the co-operation of the biggest men there +if S + r^ eseciire .d’ &gt; should then turn to London. There was also expressed a desire mat 1 siiould visit Pans as soon as possible to see the French bankers. 14 To-day however, M. Kokovtseff, m a talk with me on the affairs of my bank, himself turned the conversation to railway-making in Persia, and, after listening to what I had to say on the subject, explained that he thinks that the time has not come for a visit to Paris as the whole question has yet to be elucidated by our Government. The Minister for foreign Affairs has asked M. Kokovtseff’s opinion, which is being prepared in the Department of Railway Business and in the General Chancellery of the Minister (of r mance), and will be given, so the Minister of Finance thinks, in a favourable sense in a week and a-half. However, m view of the extreme importance of the question, the minister oi I mance thinks it essential to bring up the question for discussion in the special Persian conference on the return of M. Stolypin, 15 and under his presidency, with the Ministers of Finance, Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs, War, and the Navy, M Kokovtseff thinks that it is only m this last stage that the question will be elll f 1( ff ted ’ ^ m \ tilen 2t Wl11 ^e possible to proceed to its realisation in fact. M. Kokovtseff promised me that the question should be brought before the conference immediately on the return of M. Stolypin, who is expected in the middle of August. , r , Lfmaps this delay will not do any particular harm to the business, if we remember that the chief financiers both of Paris and of London are away, and, being on their o mays, will not much care to take up a big affair, so that discussion would naturally be postponed till autumn. J _ I myself have written to M. L. E. Nobel, who is abroad, and to M. A. D. Schlesinger, froniHmm^ ^ lreCtorS t ^ ie ^ oscow Commercial Bank, and I am expecting to hear Your obedient servant, P.

The fears of Persian distrust are exaggerated; the Persians were hostile to Russia and England when both countries were stoppino* them from making railways there. Some Persian reactionaries may talk now, but that is all. There is no need to start with concessions; that can be done later. So M. Homyakoff; but M. Timiriazeff agrees with 14 I agree to sounding Paris first, i.e., to consulting, but not to making a Consortium there before one is made m London. The only sound plan for Anglo-Russian relations is to make the first Consortium in London and then to ask the French to join.—N.A H. lo I have sent to M. Stolypin the memorandum and a detailed letter, so he will know all before the permanent Persian conference discusses the subject. 16 Yes; it is only there that the question can be settled; but we must first know that we can o-et money; i.e., Mr. Bark should go to Paris first (he will now soon do so).commerce, and as president of the Anglo-Russian Chamber of Commerce he is more than, anyone else identified with the commercial rapprochement. ^ M.

Homyakoff may come to England for a month in the autumn— e.g., from 15th September. He conceives the matter to be an entirely private affair, but one that needs the approval of both Governments, and must be carried out in the common interests of both States. He therefore thinks it most desirable that both Governments should know, quite informally and quite privately, how the project is proceeding.[This Dgcniffant is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] [BJ PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [27694] No. 1. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 2.) (No. 326. Confidential.) Slr ’ M TWnTQTTV f . • , „ Ibv OLbllY a lew days ago mentioned to me that M. Khomiakoff, late president ox the JJnma, and some substantial Russian financial houses were preparing a project i • t ^ le ^ nc ^ an an&lt; ^ Russian railway systems by way of Persia. He had asked M. Khomiakoff to furnish him with a memorandum on the subject, and when he r n Cei 7 e h l 1116 T° uld be ha PP-7 t0 allow me t0 peruse it. I told M. Isvolsky at the time that 1 did not think that British, and certainly not Anglo-Indian, public opinion was as &gt;et disposed to entertain such a project. It was quite likely that the time would arrive when transcontinental communication would have to be established, but the moment had not yet come to bring such schemes before the British public. M. Isvolsky observed that in Russia also there was opposition to such schemes, but cmpfly Russian commercial circles. At the same time a line traversing Persia and connecting the Russian and Indian railway systems would effectually compete W1 ibi nCd Bagdad Railway. He thought that the question was one which would have to be considered seriously within the near future. Subsequently M. Isyolsky lent me his copy of the memorandum which he had received from M. Khomiakoff. It was a lengthy printed document in Russian, and entered mto a mass of detail, in regard to which, M. Isvolsky informed me, the experts o the .foreign Ministry considered that several of the data were erroneous. I beg leave to enclose a summary made by Mr. O’Beirne of the outline of the Russian project, Ihe promoters of the scheme seem to be singularly optimistic as to the profitable character of the undertaking. M. Isvolsky has in no wise presented the matter in any official form, and our conversation has been quite desultory and unofficial. There is therefore no necessity to take any official cognisance of the matter, and I merely report it as showing that the question is occupying the attention of certain prominent men in this country. I have, &amp;c. i A. NICOLSON. Enclosure in No. 1. Ah struct of Confidential Memorandum regarding 'proposal of Russian Syndicate for a Trans-Persian Railway. THE scheme is to create a “ world railway,” connecting Europe with India and certain countries of the Far East by an uninterrupted line of rail. The nearest approach hitherto made to realising such a scheme was in 1889, when the provisional c ® ns P r fl ^ ^fl e Persian Government was obtained to the construction of a railway from the North of Persia to the Gulf of Chahbar. That plan was abandoned owing to the political conditions which obtained at the time. Since then the conditions have radically changed, owing (I) to the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907 ; (2) to the commencement of the Bagdad Railway by Germany; and f3) to the termination in March of the current year of the Russo-Persian railway agreement. A few years ago a proposal such as the present would have aroused suspicions in England of aggressive designs on the part of Russia. Now the principal source of anxiety to England is the Bagdad Railway, and an English statesman would certainly prefer ^ the present scheme to the completion of the Bagdad Railway under any conditions which are likely to be agreed upon between England and Germany. No doubt there still exists among a certain group of Englishmen some mistrust as to Russia s political aims in Central Asia. This mistrust must be combated by the [2854 5—3]J 2 adoption in general of a straightforward policy calculated to consolidate the ties already existing between the two countries, and more particularly by adopting a line of action in regard to the proposed railway which may dispel the last remaining suspicions in the minds of Englishmen. Thus the initiative ought to be taken not by the Russian Government, but by a group such as would, offer full guarantees m English ^ eves both from the political and the business point of view. It is important to make such a selection of the persons and private institutions to be connected^ with the proposed enterprise as will inspire confidence m England, and give rise lo no suspicions as to hidden political aims. As regards the direction of the proposed line Englishmen would naturally consider dangerous from the strategic point of view any lines uniting those points of Russian and Anglo-Indian territory which lie closest to one another. We would therefore hardly expect England to consent to the continuation of our line from Kushk, which, moreover, would meet with obstacles from Afghanistan. The same may in part be said as to the construction of a line from Mery to Meshed, which for England would also represent a certain strategic danger. Ihe case is completely different in regard to the construction of a line through the whole of Persia; for instance, from Baku, or some station close to it. Such a line, which would run for a distance of over 2,000 versts (1,200 miles) through neutral Persian territory, could not be regarded as a serious threat to India. It may be added that under the 1107 agreement Russia has the right to construct within her own sphere a whole senes ot lines, which would be not less dangerous for India from a military point of view than the proposed “ world railway,” but which on the other hand would offer England absolutely no advantages. v ^ It would be premature to attempt to define the direction of the line very exactly. For Russia the important point is the selection of the place of departure fiom Russian territory. Englishmen are most interested in the point of union with the Indian railway system. In order to avoid possible difficulties on their side, it is desirable to consult as far as possible the wishes of those Englishmen who are willing to co-operate in the enterprise, and also the point of view of the British Government. It would also be extremely undesirable to divide the line into British and Russian sections respectively. Such a course could only give rise to mutual mistrust, besides probably creating difficulties on the part of Persia. The best course would be to construct the whole line jointly, admitting to a participation in the enterprise only one foieign element—the French—unless it may prove feasible to admit the Persians themselves to some share in the enterprise in connection with their indebtedness to Russia and England. The admission of France to participation would probably tend to remove the objections likely to be raised by the Persian Government. ... Ti lt may be objected by some Russians that the project will be injurious to Russian trade in North Persia because it will facilitate foreign competition. To this it is replied that the time is past when foreign goods other than Russian were virtually excluded from the North Persian market. England is at liberty under the 1907 agreement to establish railway and other communications in her sphere of influence, and both England and other nations can open up communications in the neutral zone. The Khanikin branch of the Bagdad Railway and the projected line from Trebizond to the Persian frontier both threaten Russia’s present position in the Persian market. Russia’s best course is to make up her mind that communications with Northern Persia will be established, and to establish means of communication which win be favourable to her own trade. ' In discussing the general course which the proposed railway should follow, tne memorandum bases its reasoning on the distance between Calais (as the point on the continent nearest to London) and Ahmedabad, to the north of Bombay. Of five geographically possible directions between Calais and Ahmedabad, four would pass through Russia, and one only through Constantinople according to the Bagdad Railway scheme. The four directions passing through Russia are (1) the transcaspian direction, (2) the transaral direction ; (3) via Kertch ; (4) via Rostov-Baku, which is the present proposal. The two first-named directions may be set aside on the ground of the objection^ which they would arouse in England, as above explained. The Kertch direction may also be set aside because of the expense and delay which would be involved by the construction of a bridge across the Straits of Kertch. There reman 1 the Bagdad line via Constantinople and the proposed line via Rostov-Baku. Ihe distance between Calais and Ahmedabad via the Bagdad line (taking into consideration the actual length of the existing lines which would be used) is 8,017 versts (4,809 miles ;, * This line would run from the head of the Persian Gulf to Kotri, and thence to Ahmedabad.the distance between Calais and Ahmedabad via Rostov—Baku is 7,864 versts (4,716 miles). There are two possible variations to the Rostov-Baku direction : (1) the construction of a line from Batoum to Kars ; (2) the extension of the existing line to Vladikavkaz as far as Tifhs, whence it would connect with Tabreez. The former line 's dismissed on account of its proximity to the Turkish frontier, the latter on account of the delay and expense which would be involved by the construction of the line from Vladikavkaz across the mountains to Tiflis. The proposed Rostov-Baku route would offer the advantage that Russian goods arriving from the interior via the Volga could be conveyed as far as Baku entirely by water. The best direction for the railway to f follow through Persia would appear to be Baku—Tehran—Kerman, the Tehran—Kerman f direction presenting less technical difficulties than any other line running from Tehran towards the south. From Kerman the line would be continued to a point on the Anglo-Indian system. The selection of this point would be left to England, but England would probably choose Nushki. There should be a branch of the main line running from Kerman to Ohahbar or another point on the sea. Passing to technical details, the memorandum estimates that, with an average speed of 45 versts (27 miles) per hour, including stoppages, the journey to Bombay would be made in seven days eighteen hours. Taking the price of a passenger s ticket through Persia on the basis of the charges now made by the Bagdad Railway, a first-class ticket to Bombay would cost about 400 roubles (40^.). The cost of construction of the line through Persian territory is estimated at 85,000 roubles per verst, or about 14,000Z. per mile. The distance from the Persian frontier to Nushki being estimated at 2,150 versts (1,290 miles), the total cost of construction would be about 18,000,000/. The capital required is put at over 20,000,000/., and it is estimated that it would yield a profit of about 15 per cent.^07 [This Document is the Property of IBs Britannic Majesty's Gcyeprrnpnf. ] PERSIA.

It is of greatest strategical importance to secure British position at the head of the Persian Gulf. Consequently, first step is to get option we hold for the southern section of the Mohammerah-Julfa line up to southern limit of Russian sphere converted into a definite concession. The next step would be to obtain a concession or option for a specified line from a port on the Persian Gulf to the plateau, through the neutral zone, in order to preclude possible German enterprise. For this purpose we recommend numbers 3 and 4 of your telegram. This would consolidate our position on the eastern littoral of the Gulf and increase our influence throughout southern Persia and central Persia. Lastly [in importance come all options or con cessions within the British sphere, i.e., Bunder Abbas, Kerman-Robat, Kerman-Charbar, or Gwattar, which should be secured merely to prevent outside interference in our sphere, and not necessarily for construction. If only blocking options are contemplated, then an option for your numbers 3 and 4 as one concession is of more immediate ‘importance for political reasons'than an option for the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line. If, on the other hand, there shoidd be any British syndicate ready to take up immediately the Bunder Abbas-Kerman project, which is undoubtedly feasible, then the acquisition of a definite concession for that line would outweigh political importance of obtaining a mere blocking option for Bunder Abbas-Shiraz- Bushire scheme, the engineering feasibility of which is not assured. All concessions should be for as long a period as possible.1 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] IB] PERSIA . [May 10.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 5. [16398] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received May 10.) . India Office, May 9, 1910. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 19th January, 1910, replying to the letter from this Office of the 23rd December, 1909, as to the policy regarding railway construction in Persia to be pursued by the British Government. Lord Morley observes with satisfaction that Sir E. Grey is prepared to ask the Russian Government not to press the question of the proposed junction of the Russian and Indian railway systems. But he would ask that in the communication to be addressed to the Russian Government on the subject His Majesty’s Government should m no way dissociate themselves from the objections taken by the Government of India to the proposal. As legalds the general question involved, Lord Morley, for the reasons stated in your letter, accepts Sir E. Grey s view that it is impracticable to maintain a policy of sterilisation. Pie agrees that in the circumstances the proper course to be pursued, in order to prevent the intrusion of any third Power, will be to obtain from the Persian Government concessions or agreements of an ear-marking ” nature for such lines as it is desirable to retain under exclusively British control. Lord Morley observes that Sir E. Grey is satisfied that such concessions or agree ments will not commit the British Government to construction at any given time. The object for which they are obtained is, as. Lord Morley understands, the general one of avoiding, as far as may be, the intervention of any third Power, and, as regards the Julfa—Mohammeiah line, to act in accordance with the scheme of policy already agreed on m principle with the Russian Government. As regards financial considerations, Lord Morley observes that Sir E. Grey recognises that is practically impossible to provide funds for construction from Govern ment sources, and that the money, when required, will presumably have to be raised in the open market, with or without guarantee. On this point Lord Morley would say explicitly that he is satisfied that it will not be to the interests of India to participate financially m the work of railway construction in Persia, whatever its indirect advan tages to her in the way of trade facilities may be. Lord M.orley has arrived at this conclusion, not only on the ground of the need in future for rigid economy in India, but on full consideration of the broad principle of policy wdnch should govern our action from the Indian point of view in relation to Persian affairs. As regards the line which it is understood the Russian Government are contem plating towards Yezd and the British frontier in Baluchistan, Lord Morley, as at present advised, agrees with the view in your letter that a line from that frontier, whether at Charbar (or Guattar) or Robat, in the direction of the Russian sphere should be “ear-marked ’ as the subject of a British concession, but he would suggest that the purpose in view would be sufficiently met if it stopped at Kerman, and he would propose that two concessions, viz., Kerman-Robat and Kerman-Charbar (or Guattar), should be applied for. v It follows from the objection of the British Government to a junction of the Indian and Russian systems that they should not, in existing circumstances, be prepared to undertake the construction of the lines so “ ear-marked.” I am to enclose copy of telegrams that have passed with the Government of India on this subject, and to suggest that, in view of the general agreement that has now been reached, the proposed inter-departmental conference is no longer necessary. If however, Sir E. Grey wishes it, Lord Morley will of course be happy to send representatives. I have, &amp;c. R. RITCHIE. [2744 £—5]Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Viscount Morley to Government of India.

LOAN to Persian Government. \ It may be necessary, in connection with conditions of joint advance of 400,0001. that some programme of railway concessions to be ear-marked to this country should be formulated. Have you any observation on the proposals which have been suggested ?— 1. The southern section of line from Julfa to Mohammerah, of which Eussia will apply for northern section ; 2. Kerman to Bunder Abbas ; 3. Ahwaz to Bunder Abbas via Shiraz with the option of a port at Khor Musa ; 4. Line between some point on No. 3 and Bushire via Aliabad ; 5. Eobat to Kerman ; 6. Guattar or Charbar to Kerman. There is, it will be understood, no probability of construction in near future of any of these lines, and application of Indian revenues to their construction would not have my consent. But possibility of concession, which might threaten political or strategical interests of India, being obtained by third Power must be guarded against. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Government of India to Viscount Morley. (Telegraphic.) P. May ^ 1910 . YOUE telegram dated the 11th April as to railway concessions in Persia. Securing of British position at the head of the Persian Gulf is of greatest strategical importance. The first step, consequently, is to get converted into a definite concession the option held by us for the southern section of the line from Julfa to Mohammerah up to tne southern limit of the Eussian sphere. Next step, in order to preclude possible German enterprise, would be to obtain a concession or option for a specified line, through the neutral zone, from a port on the Persian Gulf to the plateau, We recommend Nos. 3 and 4 of your telegram for this purpose. By this means our position on the eastern littoral of the Gulf would be consolidated and our influence throughout Southern and Central Persia increased. All options or concessions within Britisfq sphere, i.e ., Bunder Abbas—Kerman-Eobat, Kerman-Charbar or Guattar, come ast m importance; these should be secured, not necessarily for construction, but merely to pi event outside interference in our sphere. If it is only contemplated to secure b ockmg options, then an option for the Bunder Abbas—Kerman line is of less immediate importance on political grounds than an option for your Nos. 3 and 4 as one concession. On tne otner nand, if any British syndicate should be ready to take up the project of a line from. Bunder Abbas to Kerman, which is undoubtedly feasible, at once, then political importance of obtaining mere blocking option for Bunder Abbas-Shiraz- Busure scneme, of which we are not assured as to engineering feasibility, would be outweighed by the acquisition of a definite concession for the former project. As long a period as possible should be fixed for all concessions.

Sir:- I am directed by Secretary Sir Edv/ard Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo containing observations on the proposal that His Majesty's and the Russian Governments should lose no time in approaching the Persian Government with a viev/ to obtain the right eventually to construct cer tain railways in Persia as a condition of the loan for which the Persian Government have asked. This letter dwells on the disadvantage to which Great Britain would be exposed, in the case of the Julfa-Mohammera line, in settling the question of rates, il the negotiations on that point are conduct ed on a basis which commits His Majesty's Government in advance to the construction of the line and on the further grave inconvenience that it will be in the P° w er of the Russian Government (v/hose financial re- India Office. /C f 7 ^ 7/3 sources(46604/09). resources are a matter of conjecture only) to dictate tne moment at which British capital shall be forth coming (to an unknown amount) for the construction of the southern section. In Sir E. Grey*s view, an application to the Persian Government to earmark this line, would not commit the British Government to construction at the dictation of the Russian Government. It is assumed from the Russian desire to apply for railway conces sions that the Russian Government will in any case insist on the reservation to themselves of the North ern portion of the Julfa-Mohammera line. If His Majesty's Government refrain from earmark ing the Southern portion, it will not prevent the commencement of the Northern half of the line and if they obtained the right to construct the line when convenient to themselves, they would not be forced to construct at Russian dictation. It would be greatly to the interest of Russia that the Southern part should not be constructed. ^ir E. Grey considers it extremely important to secure(46604/09). secure the option of constructing the Southern por tion which would pass through &amp; region where British enterprise has already secured a firm foothold, other wise some other Power will certainly apply for it. He sincerely hopes that this explanation will remove Lord Morley 1 s objections. As regards the question of funds, I am to observe that the sum necessary for the construction of this f line would be B0 large that there could hardly be any ’ _ ^ .. question oi providing it from government sources, either Imperial or Indian, and that it would presuin- I have to be raised by a loan in the open market with or without a Government guarantee. It is stated that, even if the contemplated ap plication were granted by the Persian Government there would he no guarantee that the concession would not nevertheless be given to a third Power should the concessionnaire prove unable or unwilling to begin construction when called on at any moment to do so. To this objection it may be answered that, as has already been pointed out in the letter of the 17th ultimo(46604/09). ultimo from this Office, the mere fact that an appli cation of the nature indicated had been made by His Majesty* s and the Russian Governments would go far to discourage the interference of other Powers and no fi iendly Power would press for a concession already granted. neglecting for the moment those passages in your letter which relate to the junction of the Indian and Russian railway systems, I am to advert to your observations regarding the three lines which it is proposed to construct in the South which, it is fear ed, may lead the Russian Government to undertake the construction of similar lines, of which the suggested direction is so far unknown, in the north. On this point I am to observe that, as the Rus sian Government attach great importance to the ques tion of railway construction in Persia, it is unlikely that they will defer the undertaking until convenient to His Majesty*s Government. There is therefore nothing to be gained by abandoning the request for the right to construct lines in the south. As for the0 (46604/09). the direction of the proposed lines in the Russian sphere, it cannot fail to he revealed in the next com munication received from the Russian Government on this sueject and, should a line from Askhahad to Me shed prove to be one of those contemplated, it will be the business of His Majesty’s Government to en deavour to secure by friendly representations the postponement of the scheme in accordance v/ith the re quest already made in the memorandum of October 9th, 1908. As regards the elfeet on trade of the construc tion of these lines, Sir E. Grey is not of course in a position to dispute the conclusion conveyed in your letter that the benefit thereby conferred on In dia in this respect would be but small. He would have thought however that, as India is nearer to the Persian Gulf than either Russia, Germany or Great Britain, Indian trade, being already to a consider able extent in possession of the market, and profiting by the already subsidised line of the British India Steam(46604/09). Steam Navigation Company, might he able to hold its Ov/n even against foreign suosidised lines of steamers. On the other hand it is indisputable that, the great er the volume of trade in general that is attracted to the Gulf by these lines, the greater the benefit to Persia and the consequent demand for further com merce which cannot fail to react favourably on India, if efforts are ma.de to keep at least a fair share / of this trade in Indian hands. It is suggested, as an alternative to the pro posed demand for the right to construct these railways that an endeavour should be made to induce the Rus sian Government to join in asking the Persian Govern ment to extend for a term of years the w sterilising' arrangement now in force which, it is urged, would be more effective in preventing other Powers from ob taining such concessions than would be the plan now under consideration. Sir E. Grey does not dispute the superior ef fectiveness of such a course in itself but he con siders(46604/09). considers that it is in fact impracticable since hem (46604/09). to remove the necessity which she now feels for rail way expansion in Persia. As regards the fear expressed in your letter that Russia may admit Germany to the neutral zone Persia as compensation for assurances given as to the Bagdad Railway, I am to recall the fact, of which Lord Morley is already aware, that, so long ago as November 26th, Sir E. Grey in his telegram. No.1343 instructed His Majesty*s Ambassador at St. Petersburg to warn the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty*s Government could hardly remain indiffer ent in such an event. I am to add that Sir A. Nicol- son has since reported that he conveyed this warning to Monsieur Izvolski and that His Excellency, in re ply, has promised to keep His Majesty*s Government informed of the progress of his negotiations with Germany with regard to this Question. I Slr E - fo’ey regards that portion of your letter which deals with the proposed junction of the Russian and Indian railway systems as by far the most import- ant on account of the objections therein set forth to a(46604/09). a trans-Persian line from a strategic point of view. Sir E. Grey's motive in making the proposal in question was based on the consideration that neglect to ask the Persian Government for the preferential right to construct the line at the time which might suit the convenience of the two Powers to do so would involve the risk that the concession might be given to a third Power. It is easy to conceive of circum stances in which this contingency might arise. For instance, in the event of Russia drawing closer to Germany as a result of a regrouping of the European Powers, the concession for a line across Persia might fall to Germany. As the Bagdad Railway progresses towards completion such a possibility cannot be dis regarded. In view however of the objections raised in your letter, Sir E. Grey is ready to modify the suggestion and to propose that His Majesty's Government should inform the Russian Government that the Government of India are unwilling to consider the question of a through railway and should ask them not to press the questionc question. It will not however he possible to prevent the Russian Government from acquiring a concession fiom Jalfa via Tehran to the frontier of their sphere or beyond it - if they wish to do so. In Sir E. Grey’s opinion it would be safer for His Majesty’s Government uo earmark a line from Yezd or a point just outside the Russian sphere to the frontier of India, so as to prevent another Power from acquiring . I it, or an endeavour might be made to obtain an under- taking from the Persian Government that they would give the line to no other Power. Sir E. Grey hopes that Lord Morley will give his further consideration to the arguments contained in this letter and would suggest that the interdepartment al Conference alluded to in your letter under reply should meet at an early date.

(47161) Sir:- BKITISH CONSULATE, B A T 0 U M. 2lBt December, 1909. An article has recently appeared in the Caucasian Press under the head of H Russian Influence in Persia”. The article is evidently borrowed from some St. Peters burg newspaper. As it treats with the question of the impending termination of the long standing agreement between the Russian and Persian Governments for the exclusive right of Russia to build railways in Persia and urges the necessity of greater activity on the part of the Russian Government in railway enterprise in Persia, I consider it of interest to forward the inclosed translation, by me, of the article, - copies of which I have also deemed it advisable to forward to His Majesty’s Ambassador in St. Petersburg and to the British Minister at Tehran. I have,* &amp;c., (Signed) P. Stevens. His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Translation. O In the year 1910 the term of the written agreement between the Russian and Persian Governments, in virtue of which the latter undertook in 1899, to grant Russia the exclusive right to build railways in Persia, ex pires. Competition for the construction of railways in Persia, - a country which is adjacent to our own - is indeed a struggle for international supremacy. When in 1899 several Russian Concessioners received from Shah Nasr-Eddin, his consent for a proposed railway conces sion from the town of Resht to the Bay of Chaubar on the Indian Ocean, our diplomatic representatives, in the persons of the late Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Giers and Zinovieff, fearing that England would claim some sort of compensation in return for the grant of the concession to Russia, did not feel justified in claiming our exclusive right to the arrangement, and therefore obtained a categorical promise from the Shah to grant no concessions without the previous consent i of i' bof our Government. This arrangement was subsequently extended to the year 1910. Now, however, the problem of building railways in Persia will no longer have to be solved between Russia and England alone, a third Great Power has also stepped in, which has taken up a leading position both in the Far and Near Easts. This Power is German:/. The latter mentioned two Powers, viz: England and Germany, when deprived of the right of building railways in Persia endeavoured froai the very outset, by every possible means, to outwit the move made by Russia but not being it able to accomplish this wish by direct measures set to S work and 0 ' Dta ined similar results by other means. They | have now tnoroughly prepared the ground for deciding the Persian railway, question to the advantage of their economic interests and political influence, j Several years ago England obtained a convention . from the Persian Government for the free navigation of the river Karun, which gave her the possibility of j reaching the town of Shuster from which three vehicle roads lead to Ispahan and Tehran. Subsequently, from tne East, England has already completed the railway fromfrom Quetta to Nushkl and Intends extending the line towards Seistan. Germany, thanks to her Bagdad rail way has procured supreme commercial influence in the markets of Asia Minor for herself and is now gradually making her way towards Northern Persia through the towns of Khanikin, Kermanshah, Ramadan and Tehran. With the completion, therefore, of the construction of the Bagdad railway and its extension in the direction re ferred to, Germany could easily and rapidly, in the absence of any railway measures from us, counteract the building of railways towards the principal markets of Persia which are important both for our trade and in general for the trade of the whole of Persia, as for instance the Provinces of Azerbijlan and Mazanderan. The shortness of the distance from Khanikin to Tehran, in all 653 versts (433 miles), and the suitability of the country for the construction of a railway speaks in favour of the scheme. Information received, points to the efforts that are being made by Germany to secure rights to the navi gation of Lake Urumia and the establishment of a GermanI German Bank at Tehran^this stands as convincing evidence in support of the supposition, that this Power is un flinchingly endeavouring to grab the richest districts of Persia with a view to the development of her trade therein, - districts which are of vital importance to Russian Commerce in North-West Persia. . ^ * Now comes the question, what has Russia done and how far has she prepared the ground for herself in this all important matter of securing railway concessions? It must be admitted that Russia having approached, with her Trans-Caucasian and Trans-Caspian railways, roads leading to the Persian frontier, has made very little progress in paving the way for herself in the question at issue. Having constructed three metalled roads in the North-West districts of Persia, namely, the Julfa- Tabriz, Enzeli-Tehran and the Kazvin Ramadan roads, she seems content to rest on her laurels, not to go any further into the question and pays no heed to North- East Persia which is so highly important to her, on the confines of which stands the Trans-Caspian railway and the natural termini of which roads should be Askabad, Kaaka, EXishak and Kushk. InIn this direction our neighbours are wide-awake Englishmen. In laying their railway to Seistan, their objective, besides being the full annexation of Seistan, is to extend their line to North-East Persia, viz:- Khorassan, which Province, in riches and density of population, is equal to the North-West Provinces of Azerbijian and Mazanderan and at an earlier period even exceeded them. The one circumstance which might have a tranquillizing effect on Russia, is that the English road to Seistan is very much longer than the Russian l road, in view of which the Trans-Caspian railway is ) ; | much nearer to the confines of those Provinces. It would seem that Russia's natural problem should have been to build roads in those parts of Persia which have been pointed out in order that they should meet her railways coming from the Trans-Caucasus, such roads would long since have greatly facilitated the movement of her goods and at the sane time would have rendered great services in preparing the way for the construc tion of railways. The centre of the North-East districts of Persia is Meshed, the principal town in all Persia as a reli giousreligious centre; here is situated the grave of Riza, the most revered local Saint or Imam. Meshed at the same time, as a trade centre ranks as first In this part of Persia and coming as it does after Tabriz, Ispahan and Tehran, as fourth in relation to the trade of the whole of remaining Persia. This City serves as a link to five big tracks. The question of its junction at the Russian end with the Trans-Caspian railway, can be solved at four differ ent points, viz: as indicated above, at the town of Askabad, at Kaaka, Dushak or Kushk. It is useless touching upon this question here, seeing that it is 1 • 1 ■ the speciality of engineers to select the most convenient spot at which the point of union should take place. In any case, the length of line to be laid from each one of the points mentioned, does not exceed three hundred versts (210 miles) and from Kaaka to Meshed, the distance is only 144 versts (101 miles). A long existing caravan road from Meshed to Tehran leads through Sebzevar, Damghan and Semnun and it is at this point that the Russian Eastern Railway system through Persia from the Trans-Caspian District and the WesternWestern from the Trans-Caucasus should lock. This measure Is all the more Important, in view of the fact that this sphere is at present exclusively under Russian influence and must he permanently secured for her. Russia must think of this at once. The term of her agreement with Persia is now expiring.[This Document is the Property of His Brita nnic Majesty’s Government.] BAGDAD BAILWAT. [December 26. J SECRET. Section 1. [46697] No. 1. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 26.) (No. 517. Secret.) (Telegraphic.) P St. Petersburgh, December 26, 1909. RUSSIA and the Bagdad Railway scheme. The Russian views on the present phase of the Bagdad Railway question are set forth in a memorandum which I have received from M. Isvolsky. His Excellency, however, has explained to me that this memorandum is not to be taken as an exhaustive statement of the Russian attitude. In the first instance the memorandum states that the Russian Government have not so far made any declaration to the effect that they will only accept the surtax of customs revenues on condition that the proceeds be not employed for the purpose of kilometric guarantees. Their reason for this was that they considered that an explicit assurance on that point was contained in the last paragraph of the Turkish note of the 5th September. If, however, the paragraph in question has no obligatory force on the Turkish Government, reservations similar to those made by His Majesty’s Government will also be made by the Russian Government. The memorandum then goes on to state that it is with great satisfaction that the Russian Government have learnt that the discussions which have taken place have so far only been discussions between the British and German financial groups, and that no proposal will be accepted by His Majesty’s Government until the question has first been discussed with the Russian and French Governments, so that any agreement arrived at may be an agreement d quatre. It is impossible for the Russian Government at present, in view of the complexity of the Russian interests involved, to formulate in detail the conditions on which they would be willing to join such an agreement d quatre. The question must first be examined thoroughly. The difficulty of giving their views on this point is further increased by the fact that no clear definition of the bases of the proposed agreement is contained in the communications which they have received from me. The memorandum next points out that there is an essential difference between the views mentioned in the memorandum which was communicated to Count Benckendorff on the 6th June, 1907, and those now put forward in the German proposals. Are they to understand that His Majesty’s Government have now abandoned the views set forth in the former ? The memorandum of the 6th June, for instance, laid dowm that an international board should be establishod, whereas the German proposals only contemplate a simple division of the railway. According to the 1907 memorandum, English interests were to extend to a point to the north of Bagdad, whereas the present proposals cede to England only the section to the south of that place. Before giving an opinion, the Russian Government would like to be informed of the views of the London Cabinet It was explained to me by M. Isvolsky that if Bagdad were to be the northern boundary of English interests, then the Khanikin branch would lie outside them, while their extension to a point farther north would take in the Khanikin branch. In conclusion the memorandum states that as Russian interests in Persia might be seriously threatened by the Bagdad Railway, it is incumbent on the Russian Govern ment to endeavour to come to an understanding on that part of the question by direct negotiation with Germany. They observe with pleasure that such an understanding would be viewed with favour by His Majesty’s Government. The Russian Government on their side will not fail to observe strictly the arrangements respecting Persia which they have made with Great Britain in the past, and will keep the British Government informed of the course of the negotiations which they may open with the German Government on this question. [2536 cc — 1][This Document is the P roperty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECRET. [43445] No. 1. [November 27.] Section 1, \ L—f. f ( W'/'D Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 27.) (No. 497.) (Telegraphic.) P. St. Petersburgh, November 27, 1909. PLEASE refer to your telegram of yesterday No.' 1343 respecting the Bagdad Railway, substance of which I communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon. His Excellency observed, as regards a Bagdad-Khanikin branch, that a concession had already been granted to the German company for a railway to the latter place which was to join the main line north of Bagdad, and that, if negotiations were started on the basis suggested by M. Gwinner between Germany and England, Russia’s own interests would, of course, require that discussions should begin between Berlin and St. Petersburgh ; if, however, an agreement had already been reached between England and Germany, the position of Russia in entering into discussions with the latter .Power would be seriously weakened. On M. Isvolsky remarking that for the purpose of bargaining with the German Government it was of course essential that he should have some asset in his hands, I observed that in any case no quid pro quo should be offered to Germany in the part of Persia outside the British and Russian spheres, as the terms of the Anglo- Russian convention would hardly admit of such a transaction. (I confess that personally I am not quite sure if this is so.) M. Isvolsky remarked that he had not said that that was the direction in which he would look when driving his bargain, but he could not go to Germany empty-handed. Germany would be very difficult to negotiate with if His Majesty’s Government did accept the proposals made last week. After conversing for some time more with M. Isvolsky I tried to elicit from his Excellency the answer which he would wish me to send to you; but he would only say that his reply would be given later, and that the question must first be examined with great care. More, I regret to say, I was unable to extract from him. I represented to his Excellency the danger of all offers being withdrawn by Germany and of the line being constructed by her alone without either Russian of English co-operation if no move were made and nothing done by the other Powers concerned. M. Isvolsky then said that the question put to me by him when we last discussed the matter still remained unanswered. On my enquiring to what question he referred, he replied that he wanted to know if the proposals put forward by M. Gwinner were going to be accepted by His Majesty’s Government or not, and were all interests in the line north of Bagdad to be abandoned ? In fact, was a conversation d deux to be definitely substituted for a conversation d quatre ? I told him that as yet no decision had been come to. His Majesty’s Government were waiting to learn his views, but if there were further delay they would probably have to decide in the above sense. M. Isvolsky recurred to the interpretation which he puts on the paragraph respecting customs surtax in the Turkish note, i.e., that Turkey is thereby debarred from applying the proceeds of the surtax to any enterprises already begun (as, for instance, the Bagdad Railway); did His Majesty’s Government think the interpretation correct ? I replied that no reply had been sent to me on this question. I find it impossible to obtain a definite answer from M. Isvolsky; and in these circumstances you may possibly wish that I should give him positively to understand that you will advise the British group to wait no longer and proceed with negotiations with M. Gwinner. In my private letter of the 19th instant I observed that it might be dangerous to leave M. Isvolsky to negotiate with Germany alone, and I am still somewhat apprehensive in this respect. But it may possibly be better to secure the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section of the line and run this risk. [2518 dd—1] Wo '€ ■ India Office, Sir, 23rd December 1909. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 44,307/09, of the 17th instant, on the subject of railway construction in Persia by Great Britain and Russia. It is proposed that, as a condition of the loan for which the Persian Government have asked, the grant of preferential concessions should be made for the following lines :— (!•) Prom Julfa via Tehran to Mohammera, the southern section only being constructed by British capital. (2.) From Tehran via Kerman to connect with the Indian railway system. (3.) From Bunder Abbas to Kerman. (4.) From Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz, with the option of a port at Khor Musa. (5.) From Bushire via Aliabad to a point on the Bunder Abbas-Ahwaz line. It is understood that there is no intention on the part of His Majesty’s Government that any of these lines should be constructed immediately— indeed most of them have not even been surveyed; but it is feared that, if the concessions are not at least applied for before the expiry of the Russo- Persian railway agreement towards the end of next year, they may fall into the hands of a third Power ; and it is therefore proposed to approach the Russian Government with a view to making a joint demand at once upon the Persian Government. Taking first the two lines in which alone Russia is interested, the proposals appear to involve certain serious risks. As regards the Julfa- Mohammera line, Sn Edward Grey recognises that simultaneous commence ment at both ends, as well as a satisfactory agreement with the Russian Government regarding tariffs, is an essential condition of the construction of the line; but he desires to postpone negotiations on these points until the concession has been granted. Apart, however, from the disadvantage to which wu3 shall be exposed in settling the question of rates if the negotiations on that point are conducted on a basis which commits us in advance to the eventual construction of the line, the proposal has the grave inconvenience of putting it in the power of the Russian Government (whose financial resources are a matter of conjecture only) to dictate the moment at which British capital shall be forthcoming—to an unknown amount—for the construction of the southern section. No indication is furnished in your letter of the sources from which such capital is expected to be found, but it must be recognised that, even if the Secretary of State in Council should decide that Indian funds could properly be applied to projects of this kind (a point on which Sir Edward Grey is well acquainted with Lord Morley’s views), it may well happen that, at the moment when the demand is made, it will be impossible, owing to financial stringency, for Indian revenues to make any contribution to the cost. It may, no doubt, be urged that, unless these risks are run, the concession may be given to a third Power. There is, however, no guarantee that this will not happen even if the policy advocated by Sir G. Barclay be adopted. S. 27. /'ey 5 //3 f?ro ' , M, ' 1:The construction of the line is not contemplated in the near future ; hut presumably there will be nothing to prevent the Persian Government, either propria motu or at the instigation of others, from calling upon the conces sionaires at any moment to carry out their concessions, and in the event of their being unable or unwilling to do so, from handing over the concessions to a third Power. If these objections are as grave as they appear to be in the case of a purely commercial line, they are infinitely graver where most important political and strategical interests are involved, as in the case of the proposed connection of the Russian and Indian railway systems. It is true that there is no question at present of immediate construction, for which the Russian Government are believed to have no funds, and that the application for a concession is advocated for purely diplomatic reasons. As to the cogency of these reasons Sir Edward Grey is, of course, the best judge. But to regard the measure as one for the realisation of which “ the moment is still remote,” and at the same time to make a concession to “ the anxiety of M. Isvolsky “ that the question should not be treated as outside the range of practical “ politics,” seems to involve an irreconcilable contradiction ; and to attempt to base a practical policy upon it seems likely to react unfavourably on the relations between the two countries in the long run. No mention is made in Sir A. Nicolson’s Despatch of the route which the proposed through line is to take. In your letter under reply the route pro posed is Julfa-Tehran-Kerman. It is assumed, therefore, that Sir Edward Grey has reason to believe that that route will be acceptable to M. Isvolsky, and that the Meshed-Seistan line will not be put forward. In any case the objections, political and strategical, felt by Lord Morley to the latter line have already been stated and remain undiminished. The alignment now suggested has not, so far as this Office is aware, hitherto been discussed, and in the absence of data it is difficult to criticise it. Erom the point of view of local political relations, it is so far less objectionable than the other that it avoids the eastern frontier of Afghanistan. But strategically the objections to it appear to be equally insuperable whether, after leaving Kerman, it proceeds via Nushki 1o Quetta, or, descending to the Gulf at Charbar, runs along the coast to Karachi. When, therefore, the time comes—as it may at a moment not of our own choosing, and probably not convenient to ourselves—when the Russian Government wish to translate into action a proposal accepted in principle by His Majesty’s Government as within the range of practical politics, the fundamental contradiction between the views of the two Governments— however skilfully it may have been glossed over in the meantime—must emerge, with the result either that His Majesty’s Government will be obliged to agree to the construction of a linq, to which they object, or that doubts will be cast upon their good faith. Turning now to the other three lines, in which Russia has no direct interest, it may be observed that the present position of the two Powers in Persia is the result of a very delicate adjustment of their commercial and political interests and spheres of influence. The construction of British railways in the south, which may be forced on us against our will if con cessions are obtained now, cannot fail to affect the balance, and may lead the Russian Government to seek readjustment by corresponding movements in the north. What those lines will be is unknown, but it is more than probable that a railway to Meshed, with possibly an extension to the southernlimit of the Russian sphere, will be one of them. To this line, as Sir Edward Grey was reminded in my letter of the 17th instant, the Government of India entertain the strongest objections—objections in which Lord Morley has concurred. And with regard generally to the construction of railways in southern Persia, considered from the purely commercial point of view, it is open to doubt whether the advantage, even to British trade, would be as great as is sometimes supposed. There seems no probability that the Russian policy of differential rates will ever be so far modified in our favour as to enable our trade to compete successfully with Russian trade in areas fed by their rail ways. While as regards the south, the existence of British railways with cheap rates will be a strong inducement to Russia and Germany to send their goods in increasing quantities by subsidised steamers to the Gulf ports. In any case, Indian tiade, m competition with British and foreign, stands to gain little. The conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing considerations is that, if the main object at present is not the construction of railways in Persia, but the ear-marking of concessions for the purpose of keeping other Powers out, this can be more certainly effected by an extension of the existing “ sterilising ” agreement for a further term of years. Sir G. Barclay foresees great difficulty in inducing the Persian Assembly to grant the concessions, and it seems probable that they, at all events, would be less unwilling to acquiesce in an extension of the agreement, to which this country should also be a party. It is a question, therefore, whether our efforts should not now be concentrated upon an endeavour to bring the Russian Govern ment to this point of view, and the small loan for which the Persian Government have already asked not to- be overweighted with such conditions as are proposed in your letter under reply. A further advantage of this course would be that in the meantime the situation would have greatly developed. For example, the fate of the Bagdad Railway, and the part destined to be played by other Powers in the Middle East, would be known. Is it certain that arrangements satisfactory to Russia in connection with the Bagdad. Railway cannot be devised which will remove the necessity she now feels for railway expansion in Persia ? Again, Sir A. Nicolson (in his Despatch No. 628, of 28th November) expresses the opinion that M. Isvolsky would not scruple to admit Germany to the neutral zone in Persia as compensation for any assurances she may be willing to give him as to the Bagdad Railway. This view is inconsistent with the desire to exclude third Powers which underlies the present proposals, and seems to point even more decidedly to a policy of further “ sterilisation ” as that which His Majesty’s Government should endeavour to carry through. In conclusion, Lord Morley agrees to the proposal to appoint a Committee to consider the question in consultation with Major Cox, and the Secretaries in the Military and Political Departments of this Office will represent the Secretary of State. Such large and important interests as are involved in the policy outlined in your letter call for the most anxious and deliberate consideration. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. Ritchie.

Sir, Foreign Office, December 17, 1909. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copies of despatches from Etis Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg^ 1 * and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran,! relative to the question of railway construction in Persia. As Viscount Morley is aware, the Russian Government have not yet replied to the memorandum on this subject handed to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 14th October, 1908, which was forwarded to your Department in draft form in Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 10th October of that year, but, in view of the approaching expiration of the Russo-Persian Agreement, whereby railway construction in Persia is barred, and of the progress of the Bagdad line, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that that rep should no longer be awaited and the settlement of the policy to be pursued no further deferred. Lord Morley will observe that Sir G. Barclay, referring to the Foreign Office memorandum of the 9th October, 1908, agrees with His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, with whom he has lately conferred, in strongly opposing the construction of the proposed Julfa—Mohammerah line from north to south instead of from both ends simultaneously, and in considering inadmissible the imposition of differential rates on British goods on that portion of the line which will run through the Russian sphere, and that he is accordingly of opinion that the execution of the project should remain in abeyance till satisfaction has been obtained from the Russian Government on these points. Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox are, however, in favour of earmarking without delay as a matter of’ general principle this and the other railways which would be of interest to His Majesty’s Government, aud they suggest, in this connection, that a line running from Bushire to join the proposed Bunder Abbas-Shiraz-Ahwas line, after passing through Aliabad, should be added to those lines which have been already specified. Sir G. Barclay foresees great difficulty in inducing the Persian Assembly to grant to the two Powers preferential rights in respect of the lines concerned, on account of the strong feeling against Russia now prevailing in Persia, and he accordingly suggests that the grant should be made an indispensable condition of any advance which the two Governments may consent to make to the Persian Government. Sir E. Grey concurs in the view of Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox as to the mode of construction of the Julfa-Mohammerah line, and as to the undesirability, in the interests of British trade, in admitting the imposition of differential rates on the Russian portion of it, but he considers that, as the settlement of* the question is likely to cause difficulty and to give rise to much discussion with the Russian Government, it should be deferred and not allowed to delay the demand to be made on the Persian Government for preferential rights to construct this and other lines. He also agrees that this demand should be made without delay in order to forestall possible demands of a similar nature by a third Power which, if granted, would react disastrously on British interests both political and commercial, and he approves the addition to the list of lines to be earmarked, proposed by Sir G. Barclay and Major Cox. Finally, he shares Sir G. Barclay’s view that a suitable moment for making the demand would be when the Persian Government apply to the two Powers for an advance of money which, as Lord Morley is aware from Sir G. Barclay’s recent telegrams, there is every prospect of their doing immediately, and he agrees in believing that the mere fact that such a communication has been made would have some effect in discouraging the Persian Government from granting concessions of the kind to a third Power, and possibly other Powers from asking for them. Sir A. Nicoison, No. 632, December 1. [2533 r—1] f Sir G. Barclay, No. 206, November 8.ll' iliyw(iHWiWI&gt;/flr 'i.'i 2 Turning now to Sir A. Nicolson’s despatch, Lord Morley will observe that M. Isvolsky is especially anxious that His Majesty’s Government should not refuse to consider the question of joining the Russian and Indian railway systems. As regards this question, Sir E. Grey fully recognises that, though this junction* will doubtless be effected at some future date, the moment is still remote when such an enterprise could be carried into effect. He would, however, submit, for Lord Morley’s consideration, that the remoteness of the time when the project can be realised affords no adequate reason for refusing to demand from the Persian Government at once the preferential right to construct the line when it may suit His Majesty’s Government to link up the Indian railway system with those of Persia and Europe by a line from Nushki to Kerman, Tehran, and Julfa. Such a demand in no way implies any obliga tion or intention to begin the construction of the line immediately, while neglect to take this opportunity of making it might be punished by the grant of a similar privilege to a third Power, which might, for example, secure permission to build a line from Tehran to the south, with branches to Seistan and elsewhere. It is clear that the construction in Persia of lines in which Great Britain had no part would be far more detrimental to British interests than their construction with the participation and under the partial control of His Majesty’s Government. There is at the same time no fear that the Russian Government would themselves immediately begin the construction of the line of junction, since, as was admitted in M. Isvolsky’s memorandum of the 15th August, 1908, they have no funds available for such a purpose. An additional reason for pressing this demand is to be found in the obvious anxiety of M. Isvolsky that the question should not be treated as outside the range of practical politics. The concession to his Excellency’s wishes involved in admitting it to consideration would, as clearly appears from his Excellency’s observations to Sir A. Nicolson, go far to reconcile him and public opinion in Russia generally to British participation in the construction of the Bagdad Railway which is a matter of the highest importance. It is therefore in Sir E. Grey’s opinion essential from a political point of view that this demand should be made without delay, while from a commercial standpoint there would appear to be no objection to the line which, if constructed, would help Indian trade to compete with Russian. To resume, Sir E. Grey would suggest that, as a first step, the two Powers should, when the Persian Government approaches them with a request for pecuniary assistance, make it a condicion of their consent to an advance that the preferential right as against other Powers to construct certain railways should be reserved to them, that these railways should include one from Julfa to Mohammerah by way of Tehran and one con necting the Caucasian Railways with the Indian system by way of Tehran, Kerman, and Nushki, and that His Majesty’s Government, for their part, should also demand the right to construct lines from— 1. Bunder Abbas to Kerman ; 2. Bunder Abbas to Ahwaz by way of Shiraz with the option of building!; a port at Khor Musa; and F S ^ 3. Bushire by way of Aliabad to some point on the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz- Ahwaz line. His Majesty s and the Russian Governments would afterwards discuss at their eisure the details of these schemes and the terms of construction of the lines which would concern them in common. Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive at Lord Morley’s early convenience an expression of his Lordship’s views on this important question, and would at the same time suggest that advantages should be taken of Major Cox’s presence in London to arrange that a conference should take place between members of this Office and of your department to discuss the matter with the benefit of his assistance and advice.

I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,[This Document is the PERSIA. I CONFIDENTIAL. [43527] F of His Britamhc Majesty’s Gov ernment.] [November 29.] Section 7. No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 290 (No. 206.; ' ^ r ’ _ Tehran, November 8, 1909. I HAVE conferred with Major Cox regarding the question of railways in Persia, and 1 have the honour to report that we are in agreement with the Foreign Office memorandum of the 29th September, 1908, as to the disastrous effect on British trade m Persia of a railway from Mohammerah to Julfa on the lines desired by the Russian Government, but incidentally we should wish to record our opinion that construction of the railway from north to south, as distinguished from, the simultaneous construction from both north and south, would, as enabling Russian trade gradually to exclude our own from districts where it now holds its own, be as objectionable as the imposition of differential rates in the Russian sphere, and should be as emphatically rejected as the latter. Were the work of construction to commence from the Gulf end under our auspices, or even from Julfa and Mohammerah simultaneously, and were differential rates excluded, it would, of course, greatly benefit onr trade, as it would enable British goods to compete favourably with Russian right up to the capital, but until Russia can be persuaded to satisfy us on these points it would be better that the project should remain in abeyance. At the same time, we think that the ear-marking of a concession for this and other railways of special interest to us should no longer be delayed, and that we should, in anticipation of the expiry of the railway embargo a year hence, lose no time in making the communication to the Persian Government foreshadowed in the memorandum handed to M. Isvolsky on the 14th October, 1908,1 find Major Cox in agreement with this memorandum as to the concessions of special importance to British interests, except that he points out the need for joining up Bushire via Ahabad with the Bunder Abbas- Shiraz line. Incidentally, I may mention in regard to the railways specifically referred to in the Russian and British memoranda as most closely concerning the two Powers, that I gather from conversation with M. Poklewsky that the reason for the conspicuous omission from the Russian memorandum of a branch linking Khanikin with the main line was that the memorandum dealt with lines which Russia wished to construct, and not with those whose construction by a third party she wished to block, which was the case with the branch in question, the construction of which would be, at any rate for a long time to come, particularly unwelcome to her. What will be the attitude of the Medjliss towards foreign enterprise in general it will be difficult to foresee, but the feeling against Russia is now so strong that I fear that to obtain an engagement from the Persian Government securing to the two Powers preferential rights in regard to railway development in Persia will require very great pressure. When in the Russian memorandum of the 15th August, 1908, it was suggested that the proposed Julfa-Mohammerah concession should be applied for in connection with a loan, His Majesty’s Government thought it better that the two questions should not be linked. Possibly His Majesty’s Government might see no objection to sujh a course if what is contemplated for the present is not a specific concession, but a general ear-marking for the two Powers of railway enterprise in Persia, and in this case I would suggest that the two Powers should make the engagement we seek a condition of any advance from the two Governments; but in any case, whether we succeed in securing such an engagement or not, the fact of our having made the communication indicated should go far to block concessions to any third party.

ISVOLSKY remarked to me this afternoon that, in connection with the Bagdad Railway, it would he necessary that oar two countries should converse on the policy to he pursued in respect to railways in Persia. This was not a question to be indefinitely postponed. The Duma deputies, when in Lon'don, had had several conversations with that public opinion in England was not yet ripe for such a project, hut, in order to satisfy that section of public opinion here who were in favour of a good understanding with England, he thought it would he a mistake to rule the question out of court. He foresaw that, whatever arrangement might eventually be arrived at in regard to the Bagdad Railway, it was probable that there would be some discontent in the minds of many Russians, as no one in Russia had ever been in favour of the railway. If by any chance the agreement did not meet the requirements of Russian interests, there might even be a revirement in sections friendly to England, and this would be unfortunate. It would therefore be desirable if some understanding could be reached between the British and Russian Governments in respect to Persian railways, and especially as to a through route to India. This would serve as a set-off to any detriment or risks which Russian interests might suffer by the construction of the Bagdad Railway. I asked M. Isvolsky whether the Duma deputies had spoken with any responsible people in London in respect to a raceordement with the Indian railways, as I was sure that the time had not yet come for such a project to be carried out. Isvolsky said that perhaps they were not, strictly speaking, responsible personages with whom the deputies had conversed, but they were hommes de valeur. He knew that it vras yet too early to realise a through route to India, but the question might be discussed with the view of its assuming a practical form “dans un avenir plus ou moins lointain.” He was anxious that nothing should occur to weaken the entente with England, and I must know that there were many who were opposed to it. I told him that I was perfectly aware of that fact, and that 1 always bore in mind that the entente was a very young and tender plant, which had not struck deep roots as yet in the public mind of either country. I then dropped the subject, as I should like to receive replies to the questions which I ventured to put before you in my telegram No. 499 of the 30th November before discussing, even academically, the question with M.

NiceIson*s suggestion for earmarking such a line for future construction after agreement with the Russian Government with a view to preventing the concession from falling into the hands of any other Power. I am to £ay that Bir E. Grey would be glad to receive Lord Money’s observations on the above points. I am also to add that a telegram since received from Sir A. Nicolson states that he has had a conversation with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of railways inin Persia, the report of which is being sent by King Messenger due to arrive in London on the 5th instant I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,© i ^£\ 0 TELEGRAM EROM SIR A.

French Ambassador said that M. Isvolsky intended to speak to me as to Persian Railways and as to the concession to provide for linking up a connection with Indian Railways. French Ambassador expressed the hope that we would be conciliatory on this point. If m.k.a. approaches me on the subject should I remind him that the Russian Government have already agreed in principle to a Julfa-Mohammerah line and that we are still waiting for a reply to our memorandum of October of last year? Or if we obtain control and construction over the southern section of the Bagdad Railway, would H.M.G. still claim Mohammerah line? As to connection with Indian Railways should I maintain former non-Jossumus attitude or would you be inclined to allow such a concession to be applied for in order to exclude other competitors and so earmark it, leaving construction to an indefinite future? I remarked to the French Ambassador that I understood that his Government had no objection to Herr Gwinner's proposals.

I HAVE conferred with Major Cox regarding the question of railways in Persia,, and 1 have the honour to report that we are in agreement with the Foreign Office memorandum of the 29th September, 1908, as to the disastrous effect on British trade in Persia of a railway from Mohammerah to Julfa on the lines desired by the Bussian Government, but incidentally we should wish to record our opinion that construction of the railway from north to south, as distinguished from the simultaneous construction from both north and south, would, as enabling Bussian trade gradually to exclude our own from districts where it now holds its own, be as objectionable as the imposition of differential rates in the Russian sphere, and should be as emphatically rejected as the latter. Were the work of construction to commence from the Gulf end under our auspices, or even from Julfa and Mohammerah simultaneously, and were differential rates excluded, it would, of course, grtatiy benefit our trade, as it would enable British goods to compete favourably with Bussian right up to the capital, but until Bussia can be persuaded to satisfy us on these points it would be better that the project should remain in abeyance. At the same time, we think that the ear-marking of a concession for this and other railways of special interest to us should no longer be delayed, and that we should, in anticipation of the expiry of the railway embargo a year hence, lose no time in making the communication to the Persian Government foreshadowed in the memorandum handed to M. Isvolsky on the 14th October, 1908,1 find Major Cox in agreement with this memorandum as to the concessions of special importance to British interests, except that he points out the need for joining up Bushire vi&amp; Ahabad with the Bunder Abbas- Shiraz line. Incidentally, I may mention in regard to the railways specifically referred to in the Bussian and British memoranda as most closely concerning the two Powers, that I gather from conversation with M. Poklewsky that the reason for the conspicuous omission from the Bussian memorandum of a branch linking Khanikin with the main line was that the memorandum dealt with lines which Bussia wished to construct, and not with those whose construction by a third party she wished to block, which was the case with the branch in question, the construction of which would be, at any rate for a long time to come, particularly unwelcome to her. What will be the attitude of the Medjliss towards foreign enterprise in general it will be difficult to foresee, but the feeling against Bussia is now so strong that I fear that to obtain an engagement from the Persian Government securing to the two Powers I preferential rights in regard to railway development in Persia will require very great pressure. When in the Bussian memorandum of the 15th August, 1908, it was suggested that the proposed Julfa-Mohammerah concession should be applied for in connection with a loan, His Majesty’s Government thought it better that the two questions should not be Jinked. Possibly His Majesty’s Government might see no objection to such a course if what is contemplated for the present is not a specific concession, but a general ear-marking for the two Powers of railway enterprise in Persia, and in this case I would suggest that the two Powers should make the engagement we seek a condition of any advance from the two Governments; but in any case, whether we succeed in securing such an engagement or not, the fact of our having made the communication indicated should go far to block concessions to any third party.

I HAVE received your despatch No. 288, Secret, of the 4th ultimo, containing your observations on the Russian aide-memoire of the 2nd August, respecting railway construction in Persia. As you are aware, His Majesty’s Government have already replied to this communication in a Memorandum dated the 9th October, of which a copy has already been furnished to you in the Confidential Print. It is, however, desirable that you should ascertain the views of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire on those aspects of the question to which you allude in the penultimate paragraph of your despatch, and, as it is proposed that Major Cox shall take an early opportunity of visiting Tehran, to confer with you on various matters relating to the Persian Gulf, you should discuss this question with him on his arrival.

' ' ^' r ’ T . t , , . „ Tehran, November 4, 1908. „„ 1/ 7°ur despatch No. 172, Secret, of the 19th September, you forwarded for Mr. Marling s observations the Russian G-overnment’s aide-memoire of the 2nd August m regard to railway construction in Persia. ^ It cannot be said that the Russian proposals are encouraging. Judging from the aide-memoire as interpreted by M. Poklewsky on the 3rd September (see your despatch No. 174, Secret, ot the 24th September), it is apparently expected that London should provide the capital, His Majesty’s Government guaranteeing the interest, for a railway which, with the conditions proposed, would destroy our trade in the Russian sphere. In order to preserve and develop the commercial interests of Russia in her zone, a network of railways in the north is projected, and, for the further safeguarding of her interests in this region, differential rates are contemplated. The enumeration of the secondaiy lines in contemplation in the Russian sphere naturally gives rise to reflections as to the desirability of similar lines in the south—such, for instance, as the line from ii \ Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, with possible extensions as circumstances may require. (See ^q (Tj Foreign Office letter to India Office of the 25th September, 1907.) I notice, however, 9 that M. Poklewsky has given it as his opinion that the branches mentioned in the aide^ memoire and the line from Askabad to Meshed are not intended to be considered with the Mohammerah-Julfa line. This is perhaps hardly reconcilable with the stipulation that the order of construction of the various lines in the Russian sphere must depend on the Russian interests involved, but, even admitting that M. Poklewsky’s conception of the intentions of the Russian Government is correct, and that for the present we need only think of the main line, the loss to British trade in Persia, if handicapped by differential rates on that portion of the line within the Russian sphere, would be quite serious enough. I do not know whether any decision has been taken as regards the alignment of the proposed railway, but I presume that it will pass through Tabreez, Kazvin, Ramadan, Burujird, Khoremabad, Dizful, Shuster, and Ahwaz. Our existing commercial interests, which would be directly affected by such a line, lie almost entirely within the Russian zone. Our trade, which now passes from the head of tffie Persian Gulf through Bagdad and Khanekin to Kermanshah and Hamadan, shows an increase during the last four years of from 700,000/. to 1,092,000/. Besides this, British goods to the value of about 150,000/. enter the Russian zone by Trebizond to Tabreez. Both these branches of British trade would evidently be diverted to the Mohammerah-Julfa Railway when built, and both, if given a fair chance, would then doubtless show considerable development; but, if the principle of differential treatment throughout the Russian zone is admitted, they are sure to be handicapped out of existence, which will be all the easier when Vladikavkas is linked up with Tiflis, and through traffic established from * the districts north of the Caucasus. Against this we might, I presume, counton an increase of trade in the neutral zone, resulting as time goes on from the development of the regions through which the line passes, but, though some of these possess no doubt great potential wealth, their develop ment seems at present very remote. They are thinly populated, and a great part of the line will run through the most lawless districts in Persia, in any case we already monopolize such trade as there is in these parts, and our only gain would accrue from the expansion of trade already in our hands. In short, we should gain nothing at Russia’s expense, whereas she would gain much at ours. On the other hand, it must he admitted that a railway from Mohammerah to Julfa, run on the purely “open-door” principle, would probably result in disaster for Russian vested interests. Possibly a workable arrangement might be devised by which the differential tariff could be restricted to the regions north of those fed from Kermanshah and Hamadan. The advantages of an early application to the Persian Government for the desired concession are undeniable, and it is much to be hoped that Russia will abate her condi- [2012 z —2]HPH|£g tions, and that the pourparlers between the two Governments wi 1 result m an ear y agreement The need for the construction of the proposed railways as a block to extensions'of the Bagdad Railway in Persia is indeed no longer so urgent, m view of the altered prospects of that railway, due to the recent revolution m 1 urkey, but there i always the chance of a competitor coming forward with railway projects for the neutra zon e y to take effect on the expiry of the Russian Railwaj Agreement m 1910, and it would be well that we should approach the Persian Government as soon as possible, if for no other reason, to forestall other possible applicants for concessions, a step which need not necessarily involve the immediate commencement of construction wore. I observe that the Russian Government regard the moment as favourable owing to the lull in German activity due to recent events in Turkey. To this I think may be added another reason for considering the present moment to be opportune. Obscure as is the political outlook in Persia to-day, it may yet be predicted with confidence that if she is left to herself, the trend will be towards a really constitutional regime, and with the anti-foreign, and especially anti-Anglo-Russian, attitude of the late Aledjliss fresh in our memory, it is much to be hoped that the concession will be obtained before a really popular Assembly is re-established. i? m , Viewed from the purely Persian point of view, the early construction of railways! highly desirable; their existence would put a powerful weapon in the hands ot e Central Government for the pacification of, and the consolidation of their authority in, regions where that authority is to-day a mere shadow and can be set at nought with impunity. Nor would the Persian Government alone benefit by railways, tor their construction and maintenance would give employment to numbers of the inhabitants, while the development which may reasonably be expected ot the resources particulaiy agricultural, of the district traversed by the line could not fail to contribute to the prosperity of the population, and should tend to the establishment of a better equmbimm between imports and exports, and thereby to a commercial stability which could not but react favourably on the general condition of the country. It is in consideration ot the great importance attached by His Majesty’s and the Eussian Governments to the existence in Persia of political tranquillity and commercial security, to both ot which railway construction would materially contribute, that I have laid stress on this latter aspect of the question. Its consideration, however, gives rise to the reflection as to the effect likely to be produced by the passage of a railway through his territory on the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in view of the special relations existing between him and His Majesty’s Government, and I submit that the opinion of His Majesty s Consul-General at Bushire would be a valuable one on this point, as well as in regard to the general effect of the proposed railway on British interests south of the Bussian zone - . • p i + i I notice that the Russian Government consider that the question of a large external loan to Persia should be considered simultaneously with that of the proposed railway. Mr. Marling has dealt so fully with this passage in the aide-memoire that I need say no more than that M. Bizot, when I saw r him a day or two ago, was as far as ever from feeling in a position to apply for even the proposed joint advance of 400,000/. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BARCLAY.hv’ jT his Document is the Property of His Britannin Majesty's Government,! PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. ? [33780] [September 29.] Section 8. Memorandum respecting Hallway Construction in Persia. . ^ emorctndum of the loth August the Russian Gl-overnment give some indications of their attitude regarding railway construction in Persia. The first paiagraph, which is as follows, shows evidence of some misappre hension :— “Le Grouvernement Britannique ayant propose au Gouvernement Imperial de proceder d’un commun accord h la construction en Perse de chemins de fer, qui, partant du point terminus du reseau Russe a Djoulfa, arriveraient a Mohammerah, le Ministere Imperial ties Affaires Etrangeres a Fhonneur d’informer PAmbassade Royale qu’il accepte cette proposition en principe, et qu’il est prdt a entrer dans un echange de vues avec 1’Ambassade concernant les modalites pratiques de la mise a execution de la dite proposition.” In making proposals to the Russian Government it is understood that His Majesty’s Government contemplated not actual construction, but rather timely co operation in earmarking concessions which might otherwise be exploited to the detriment of both Powers. Any agreement now reached should simply be of a protective character, aiming at the exclusion of third parties, and calculated to assure to Great Britain and Russia a position of vantage whenever the time is ripe for construction, thus avoiding outside competition in enterprises not devoid of political import. The drawbacks, in existing circumstances, of entering into detail as to the alignment of the railway, the constitution of the Board, the allotment of shares, or the adjustment of tariff rates are clear j any attempt to settle these matters would be premature, and likely to lead to future embarrassment. For, apart from the uncertainty of the political situation, alike in Turkey and in Persia, there are many factors, now unknown quantities, which cannot fail to exercise a determining influence upon the subject under discussion, such, for instance, as the governing consideration of cost, the absence of all surveys, even of a preliminary character, the results which may attend the operations of the Oil Syndicate in South-West Persia, the ultimate constitution of the Bagdad Railway Company, and the question of whether or not a branch line is constructed to Khanikin. Many developments of this nature must, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, be awaited before a railway from Julfa to Mohammerah can be planned or built with adequate commercial success. Indeed, it is not altogether impossible that one object of such a railway, viz., to forestall the advent of the Germans, might more effectively be accomplished, in a district with incomparably greater commercial possibilities and minor obstacles to con struction, by building a railway from Bagdad to Bussorah along the Tigris Yalley. Attention will be directed to some aspects of this question in a separate Memorandum which is in course of preparation. Dealing now' with the several points raised in the Russian aide-memoire, they may conveniently be summarized as follows :— 1. The Russian Government would be prepared to liberate Persia from the anti- Railway Convention. In existing circumstances the Convention expires on the 11th November, 1910, and it is hardly conceivable that construction could be begun before then. In this connection it is interesting to note that, in 1902, the Grand Yizier informed His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires that he had intimated to Count LamsdorfF that “ Persia would not agree to a further renewal of the Agreement, which would expire in 1910.” [1925 ff- —8]2 2 Neither Persia nor Russia can participate in building railways by subscribing capital but the Russian Government are ready to accept His Majesty’s Government’s proposal, if the financial side of the question can be solved with British assistance. Public opinion would of course ridicule the idea of building a railway, of which two-thirds would be in the Russian sphere, at British expense. 3. The question of a loan to the Persian Government is intimately connected with ' u that of a Railway Concession. Apparently the meaning of this is that a loan is to be made to Persia, on more favourable terms than would otherwise be the case, in return for the grant of a Railway Concession. The upshot of such a provision as this is that a proportionate addition must be made to the cost of the railway, which is to be built at British expense. _ Mr. Marling has just reported that he is by no means convinced that the Persian Government are in ileed of a considerable loan. 4. The lines in the Russian sphere should serve to maintain and develop Russian interests (a) by the chronological order in vhich they are built; and (&amp;) by manipulation of Tariff rates on the Mohammerah line. Assuming, solely for purposes of argument, that the financial difficulty had been overcome, His Majesty’s Government might meet the Russian Government to a certain extent by agreeing that construction should be carried out from north to south, and not vice versd, thus affording prior opportunities to Russian commerce. ^ It would be out of the question to assent to the discrimination of 1 ariff rates in favoui ol Russian goods. Moreover, the influx of British goods which the Russian Government appear to contemplate with anxiety, would be more than outweighed by the advantages Russian trade would derive through connection with the sea. 5. Russia would desire to build branches from Resht, Enzeli, and Tehran. The necessity of a line from Askhabad to Meshed must likewise be considered. It would perhaps be possible to induce the Russian Government to defer the Askhabad-Meshed line for several years, as it would be sure to evoke great opposition at present in India and Afghanistan. Eventually the Russian and Indian systems are likely to be linked up, but precipitate action such as the construction of a line to Meshed might have the opposite effect of that desired, and lead to a recrudescence of mutual mistrust. As, however, the Russian Government have intimated their views in regard to this line, we might, in replying, state that we consider there are serious objections to raising the question of construction in Eastern Persia at present; that when the time comes a British line might be made from Lingah or Bunder Abbas along the important trade route to Kerman; but that this is an aspect of the question which does not present itself in dealing with the proposals regarding a line from Julfa to Mohammerah. Perhaps it would be well to prepare a Memorandum for communication to M. Isvolsky, showing the misunderstanding which has arisen, and setting forth the financial difficulties involved in the Russian proposals.

Sir, Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received September 28.) Confidential.) Gulahek, September 10, 1908. IN his telegram No. 135, repeated in your telegram No. 207 of the 17th ultimo His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh has reported that while the Russian Government agree in principle to the proposal for a railway from Mohammerah to Julfa and are prepaied to entei on a discussion of the practical details, they consider that the question is intimately connected with that of an important external loan which the financial difficulties of the Shah render necessary. Theie can of couise be no question of the great benefits which must accrue to Persia from the construction of the lines contemplated even with the discriminating conditions which the Russian Government desire to impose in favour of Russian trade, but as regards the loan I am by no means convinced that any really considerable sum is required, and I venture to offer for your consideration some observations on this point and also, though with some diffidence, on the consequences which appear to me to be inevitable should such a loan be accorded. I take it of course for granted that His Majesty s Government would in no circumstances be parties to any such operation except on the most stringent conditions that the loan will not be squandered. It may at once be conceded that the Treasury is, and has for some time past been, empty ; empty, that is to say, when any call is made on it for real public needs. I believe, however, that Persia can, and does, raise sufficient revenues to meet her expenditure, and in this opinion I am supported by Mr. A. 0. Wood, the newly appointed Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who, from his long residence in the country, is well qualified to judge. M. Bizot also has expressed to me confidentially his opinion that financially Persia is by no means in so bad a case as is generally believed, but the efforts which have been made from very different motives by both theMedjliss and Reactionaries to prevent him from making any real examination of the situation, have been so successful that it would scarcely be just to him to quote his opinion as authoritative. It is at any rate now pretty certain, in spite of all reports to the contrary, that the Maliat, the chief source of internal taxation, has been collected much as usual for the past two years by the local Governors” throughout the country. But it is equally certain that it was never applied to the proper purposes. During the era of the first Medjliss it is probable that the Governors, at the instigation of the Shah, alleged inability to collect it, and trusted to the general chaos to cover their defalcations by discreet bribery. Since the coup d’Etat of the 23rd June there is great reason to believe that the Governors have been made to disgorge very considerable sums, which have been used partly to pay the Royalist u troops ” and partly to satisfy the rapacity of the Court Camarilla. The Maliat receipts may thus never have reached the Treasury, but there is no ground for supposing that they have diminished, and as the revenues from the two other most important sources, viz., customs and telegraphs, have indubitably improved, it may be inferred that the total revenues of Persia are, at the worst, not smaller than three years ago. The question then arises is the revenue sufficient to meet the expenditure. With proper control over the latter, I believe that it is. It may be admitted once more that the Persian Budget of to-day—if such a thing were ever compiled—-would show a formidable excess over the expenditure of twenty years ago. It is, however, probable that the expenses necessary for the ordinary administration have altered but little, and that the only serious and inevitable addition to the Budget is the service of the debts incurred under the late Shah, the excess Budget being accounted for by the incredible development of the pension system, which is the bane of Persian finance. The annual total payable under this head is probably unknown, but how considerable it is may be judged from the fact that a pension once acquired is practically unextinguishable, since a trifling fee will insure its continuation to his descendants on the death of the original2 grantee. Moreover, a small pension could be bought for three or four years purchase, and pension orders (“kabs”) are so numerous that they aie a common object of speculative purchase in the bazaars; three months ago, for instance, they were sold at 30 per cent, of their face value, but the report of an impending foreign loan or advance Las now brought the price up to 50 per cent. Recognizing that it was the first step towards attaining financial equilibrium, the late Medjliss made an effort to suppress the great majority of these pensions, but was not strong enough to carry its well-meant intention into effect. Another flagrant instance of senseless expenditure is the extravagant number of useless officials in every public department; but the catalogue of abuses is almost endless, and enough has been said to show that even a half-hearted measure of reform and retrenchment would probably bring necessary expenditure down to the level of the receipts, while rigid economy might show a respectable balance. It is, however, impossible to show any comprehensive figures; an approximate estimate of receipts might perhaps be attempted, but any figures given for expenditure would be scarcely better than guess work, and until the Financial Adviser has been furnished with data sufficient to prove the contrary I cannot abandon the belief that with fairly honest and intelligent administration the Persian Minister of Finance should be able to make both ends meet. ' These conclusions, if only approximately accurate, must necessarily ^ affect the question of a loan. In the Russian Memorandum, of which Sir Arthur Nicolson has been so good as to send me a copy, no specific reasons for its necessity are given ; it is only stated that the amount will be important and no figure is mentioned. The subject is one on which M. de Hartwig and 1 have agreed that we must await a definite expression of opinion from the Financial Adviser and we have never discussed it. M. Bizot, however, seems to be no nearer to acquiring the necessary data to enable him to form such an opinion than he was within a month of his arrival, but from what he has said to me confidentally I gather that he is very sceptical as to the expediency of a loan in present circumstances. There are, of course, hugh arrears of salaries and pensions; but it is probable that the claimants would be more than satisfied to compound for a trifling fraction of the amount nominally due, if they were assured of punctual payments in future. Under this heading, therefore, no very considerable sum need be estimated for. Arrears of pay due to the army are a convenient fiction invented in the interests of highly-placed personages, and can therefore be disregarded. There are, however, two financial operations of importance for which a loan might be justifiably utilized, f.e., the conversion of the advances from the English and Russian Bank which at present bear the high rate of interest of 12 per cent., and the payment of the floating debts of the Government to native bankers. What these latter may amount to is not known, but the total must be considerable. If carefully sifted, it would almost certainly be found that a large proportion are not properly Government debts at all, but have been acknowledged as such through the influence of highly-placed personages, while the remaining creditors could not improbably be brought to agree to compound for a reasonable figure. Superficial as it necessarily is, I venture to think that this review of the position here is sufficient to show that the necessity, from a purely financial standpoint, of any considerable loan has still to be proved. But, from another point of view, a large foreign loan would be in the highest degree beneficial to Persia, inasmuch as it must, as I understand, be accompanied by conditions entailing a thorough reform of the financial system of the country. But here we are confronted with the lamentable fact that there is no effective desire for reform. I fear that if the experiment is tried, it will be found that officialdom, from the highest to the lowest ranks, the whole of the nobility and moneyed classes, and most of all the Shah’s entourage, will be opposed to it, and it is even doubtful whether the support of the Medjliss itself can be counted on. The constitution of the body to be convoked on the 14th November under a new electoral law is still problematical; if it proves to be subservient to the Shah, or rather to the Court party, it will follow the line of conduct pointed out by them, and what that will be there can be no question; while if it should be of the same temper as the first Parliament, it will be suspicious of any scheme of reform inaugurated under Anglo- Russian auspices. In fact, if the small traders and artisans are accepted, hostility is to be anticipated from all the urban population, which alone is capable of making its influence felt, while the peasantry will remain indifferent on a question which they do not even understand. There is also another point to which I have to invite your attention, namely, that any scheme of financial reform, the execution of which is intrusted to Persians, must, ipso facto, fail. The causes are the inherent defects of the Persian character, onwhich I need not dilate, but it is a fact I have never heard questioned by any compe tent and disinterested observer, either Persian or European It follows then that European control m the Ministry of Finanee-and perhaps, also, in the spending departments of the other Government offices—is indispensable. l g The conclusions at which I have arrived may be summed up as follows- That Persmn finance is m by no means so desperate a state as appearances would seem to show; that while a small advance may be required to relieve urgent necessities the ^ed of any considerable foreign loan requires careful examination f that the condiW i financial leform on which His Majesty’s Government will assent to a loan will be unacceptable to Persia; and lastly, that no reform is possible unless carried out under European surveyance There is, therefore, the prospect that His Majesty’s Government by consenting to a loan, may be led into assuming indirectly a large measure of responsibility for the proper administration of Persian finances. Such control would undoubtedly be of the highest benefit to Persia, but it is for His Majesty s Government to decide whether they are willing to share with Russia the immense difficulties of such a task; and I venture with the greatest deference to suggest that if this question is to be considered m connection with a scheme of railways our interests will best be served by advocating the latter project and reserving the question of financial reform for later discussion.

[33780] No. 1. Memorandum handed to M. Isvolsky, October 14, 1908. HIS Majesty’s Government have examined with much interest and careful attention the aide-memoire communicated by the Russian Government to His Majesty’s Ambas sador at St. Petersburgh on the 2nd (15th) August on the subject of railway construction in Persia. Some misapprehension appears to have arisen in regard to the precise nature of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, who, in approaching the Russian Govern ment, contemplated not actual construction, but rather timely co-operation in ear marking Concessions which otherwise might be exploited to the detriment of Great Britain and Russia. His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance to a complete under standing with the Rrissian Government on this question. They consider, however, for reasons which will be indicated forthwith, that any Convention now’concluded by the two Powers with the Persian Government should be of a protective character, and calculated to assure to Great Britain and Russia a secure position as regards enterprises involving political issues whenever the time is ripe for construction. Apart from the uncertainty of the political situation, there are many factors, now unknown quantities, which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, render impracticable, in existing circumstances, any definite scheme of railway development in Persia, such, for instance, as the absence, at any rate in Southern Persia, of all surveys, even of a preliminary character, as the ultimate constitution of the Bagdad Railway Company, and as the question of whether or not a branch line is constructed from Bagdad to Khanikin. Many developments of this nature must be awaited before a railway from Julfa to Mohammerah can be built with adequate prospects of commercial success. Moreover, the principal obstacle to railway construction in the immediate future is undoubtedly to be found in the governing consideration of cost, and in the difficulty of securing the necessary capital. The Russian aide-memoire emphasizes the inability of the Persian Government to meet the requisite expenditure, and the reluctance of the Russian Ministry of Finance to afford pecuniary assistance for this purpose. His Majesty’s Government on their part are fully persuaded that no projects of railway enterprise in Persia in the present economic and political condition of the country would be sufficiently attractive to induce 'British capitalists to select them as a field for investment; while His Majesty’s Govern ment would not feel justified in guaranteeing a minimum rate of interest where the risk involved would be difficult to estimate, but undoubtedly considerable. His Majesty’s Government find some difficulty in appreciating the full inwardness of the suggestion contained in the Russian aide-me'moire that the question of an important external loan is intimately connected with that of a Railway Concession, and should be dealt with simultaneously. If it is considered that a loan should be made to Persia on more favourable terms than would otherwise be the case, in return for the grant of a Railway Concession, then an addition must be made pro tanto to the cost of constructing the railway. His Majesty’s Government are not convinced that such procedure would be financially expedient, and they incline to the belief that it would tend to simplicity if these distinctive operations were to be considered upon their respective merits. As regards the question of an external loan, a comprehensive despatch, of which the substance will shortly be communicated to the Russian Government by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, has recently been received from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the subject of the actual financial position of the Persian Government. Mr. Marling, after reviewing the principal aspects of the question, arrives at the conclusion that the resources of the Persian State are, if properly administered, amply sufficient to enable necessary expenditure to be covered by existing revenue, [1970 o—l]2 and he expresses his conviction that any large advance made to the Persian Govern ment from abroad might, in the long run, aggravate rather than effectually relieve the present fman government consider that the efforts of Great Britain and Russir should be directed to impressing upon the Persian Government that the real interests of The State imperatively demand a policy of retrenchment and financial reform ; tha such reform must constitute the bed-rock of all economic progress and commercial prosperity; and that, as a preliminary step in the desired direction, the Persian authorities should make it their first aim to afford the Financial Inspector full support and loyal of H;g Majest &gt; s Government, only upon the establishment of financial equilibrium in the Persian Budget that the question of actual railway con struction in the country can be faced with due regard to the elementary prmcip es o commercial prudence. This construction should, they consider be carried out under such conditions that a minimum rate of interest upon the capital involved would be, secured, without the risk of defalcation, by the Persian Government. His Maiesty’s Government are of opinion that, m view _ of the important political interests at issue, Great Britain and Russia would be fully justified ^n informing e Persian Government that, in the event of railway communications being established i Persia, they would expect to have the refusal, upon terms equally favourable to any offered by third parties, of all Concessions which might be in contemplation. His Majesty’s Government are well aware of the existence of the Russo-1 ersian understanding which precludes the grant of any Railway Concession m Persia before November 1910. TT - n/r • ^ n . + A somewhat similar arrangement is in force between His Majesty s Governm n and the Persian Government whereby, in the event of railway construction eing undertaken north of Tehran, a Concession for a railway in the south would forthwith be accorded to a British Company. . , His Majesty’s Government would suggest that these Agreements might well be made the basis of a further communication to the Persian Government, and at the same time the British and Russian Governments might intimate the lines to which they respectively attach especial importance. . . , -i.\. The Russian Government have already acquainted His Majesty s Government with their views on this aspect of the question. His Majesty’s Government, on their P 9 ^ besides the southern section of a line which may he built from Julfa to Mohammerah, would specify, as the Concessions which most closely concern them, the lines Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas, via Shiraz, to Ahwaz, with the option to construct a port at Khor Musa. It is stated in the Russian aide-memoire that the lines in the Russian spheie should serve to maintain and develop Russian interests {a) by the chronological order in which they are built, and (h) by adjustment of Tariff rates on the Mohammerah Railway. His Majesty’s Government consider that the drawbacks, in existing circumstances, of entering into detail as to the adjustment of Tariff rates, the allotment of shares, or the constitution of the Board of Control, are obvious, and they submit that any attempt to settle these matters would he premature and likely to lead to future embarrassment. However far they might he prepared to meet the Russian Govern ment in regard to the order in which the several lines may he built (a point wlncn may well he reserved for subsequent consideration), they cannot hut feel that it would he well-nigh impossible, if the Mohammerah Railway is to he worked^ on a commercial basis, to assent to anything that could he regarded as a discrimination ot Tariff rates in favour of Russian goods. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government, animated by a spirit of sincere friendship towards the Russian Government, and impressed with the importance of avoiding any action which may prejudice the beneficial development of commercial and political relations between the two countries, venture to express the hope that the question ot connecting Askhabad with Meshed by rail may he allowed, for the present, to remain in abeyance. They are apprehensive lest, in the existing state of political feeling m Afghanistan, an additional element of unrest might be introduced into a situation which is already not devoid of difficulty if this question were to he prematurely broug into prominence.

PERSIA. [September 29.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 6. 133769] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received September 29.) Sir, India Office, September 28, 1908. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, asking for the views of the Secretary of State for India on the Memorandum of the Russian Government of the 15th ultimo in regard to the scheme propounded to them by the British Government for the joint construction of a railway from Mohammerah to Julfa. 2. As regards the question of cost, the Russian Government point out that Persia is unable to provide funds, and that the state of their own finances does not allow them to find capital, but they are ready to meet the proposal made to them if the financial difficulty can be settled with the help of His Majesty’s Government. 3. Coming to the question of the steps to give effect to the scheme, the Russian Government consider that the question of a Railway Concession should be settled simultaneously with that of the loan, which they appear to assume it will shortly be necessary to make to the Persian Government. They are willing to release the Persian Government from the undertaking to grant no Railway Concession till after the year 1910. 4. As regards the lines to be constructed in their sphere, the Russian Government consider that Tehran should be connected with the Julfa-Mohammerah line, and also with Resht and Enzeli. They further contemplate the construction of a line from Askabad to Meshed. They state that the order in which these lines are to constructed should be such as to meet Russian interests, and that the question of the rates on the line to Mohammerah must he so regulated as not to injure the commercial and financial position established by Russia in her sphere. 5. The paramount difficulty, in Lord Morley’s opinion, is that of finance. His objections to the principle of contributing from Indian revenues to the cost of British political and commercial enterprise in Persia are well known to Sir E. Grey. Further, the present financial position in India renders it impracticable for the Secretary of State in Council to provide funds at present either by loan, guarantee, or otherwise, for expenditure on any scheme of railway construction in Persia. If the Russian proposal is to be entertained in its present form it will therefore be for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to decide whether British revenues can afford the cost. 6. As regards the question of the possibility of a loan to Persia, which is raised by the Russian Memorandum, I am to take this opportunity to say that the balances of the Home Treasury of the Government of India have been so seriously depleted by the recent reduction of the sales of bills on India and other causes, that it will not be practicable to provide from them, as was done in the case of former loans, either the whole or part of any sum that His Majesty’s Government may decide to advance to the Persian Government. The necessary funds would therefore have to be provided by the British Exchequer, as the Secretary of State in Council would not be justified in borrowing for the purpose. 7. There is the further difficulty to be considered in connection with the railway question that it has not yet been ascertained for certain that the construction of the proposed line is practicable from the engineering point of view. The evidence taken by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence showed that not only have no surveys been made, but that there has not been even such an examination of the country through which the line would run as to enable even the roughest forecast, either of the cost or of the alignment to be followed, to be made ; nor have we, so far as Lord Morley is aware, any information as to the cost of the lines proposed in the Russian sphere. 8. Lord Morley’s view on the general question, as at present advised, is that it is impracticable to take into consideration the question of immediate construction. The most that could be contemplated would, in his opinion, be to obtain jointly with Russia pledges from the Persian Government, which would make it impossible for any third Power to obtain Concessions for railways. But it would have to be clearly stipulated that His Majesty’s Government are not pledged to actual construction till the [1925 f-6]development of Persia makes it possible for the scheme to be financed on sound lilLGS 9. I am to draw Sir E. Grey s attention to the bad effect that would be produced on public opinion in India and Afghanistan if it were believed &gt; that the Russian Government intended to make the line to Meshed, referred to in their Memorandum.

The Russian Charge d’Alfaires called at this Department on the 3rd instant, and stated that he had a message from the Russian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that he considered the present moment opportune for approaching the Persian Government on the subject, on the ground that there is a lull in German activity in Persia, owing to recent events in Turkey. M. Poklevski was informed in reply that the Russian Memorandum raised some difficult questions, and read as if the extensions to Tehran, Resht, and Enzeli were all to be considered together. He gave it, however, as his opinion that this was not intended, and that the Russian Government had merely intended, out of courtesy, to communicate their views on these points. All they desired at present was to ascertain His Majesty’s Government’s views as to the Mohammerah-Julfa line. They hoped to be placed in possession of these at no distant date, though they understood the reason for deferring a communication until after Ministers had returned to London. It was pointed out to M. Poklevski that the financial difficulty was serious for His Majesty’s Government as well as for the Russian Government. He argued that it would not be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to guarantee a loan, something of the kind having been contemplated by Lord Lansdowne in the case of the Bagdad Railway. In conclusion, M. Poklevski was informed that the appointment of a Committee to consider the question in all its bearings was under consideration. siJrc: .

Russian Government, being unable to furnish capital themselves, would be ready to settle financial side of question with the assistance of Great Britain. Russian Govermnent further consider that, in view of the financial difficulties of the Shah, question of an important external loan is intimately connected with that of Railway Concession, and that two questions should be arranged simultaneously. Russian Government would propose to join the line with Tehran and also to link up Tehran with Resht and Enzeli. Furthermore, necessity of constructing a line from Askabad to Meshed must be considered.

His Excellency said that the matter was one w’lich would* ffihis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.! IN reply to your despatch IS T o. 70 of the 9th ultimo, in which you were so good as to forward, for observations, a Memorandum by Mr. Eees, M.P., I have the honour to transmit herewith an admirable and lucid Memorandum, drawn up by Mr. Loraine, after consultation with myself, examining and discussing, in a manner which is entirely in accord with my own views on the subject, the suggestions put forward by Mr. Rees for the utilization of the situation created by the recent Anglo-Russian Convention. Mr. Loraine draws especial attention to the expediency of considering what steps should be taken for the development of means of communication in south-western Persia, and the importance of this is, I venture to think, largely emphasized by the recent discovery of an oil well in Arabistan, the only information in regard to which that has yet reached me I had the honour of reporting in my telegram No. 126 of the 28th ultimo. From such meagre facts as are available it is, of course, impossible to estimate whether oil has been, or will now be, struck in sufficient quantities for the laying of a pipe line and the regular exploitation of the Concession as a paying concern. Should such, however, prove to be the case, a great impetus will infallibly be given to the development of the neighbouring regions, and the port of export, presumably Mohammerah, will at once assume an importance it has not hitherto possessed. In the corner of Persia affected circumstances -are peculiarly favourable to the expansion and consolidation of British interests. The firm of Messrs. Lynch Brothers occupies a prominent position at Mohammerah and Ahwaz, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have a steamer service on the Karun, in the hinterlandis the Bakhtiari road constructed by British enterprise, the Oil Syndicate is well known in the district through those of its officers who have been conducting the boring operations in recent years, and, lastly, in view of our special relations with the Sheikh of Mohammerah in particular and in a lesser degree with the Bakhtiari Khans, nothing would be more natural than for us to take the lead in the development of the regions which they govern. I entirely agree with Mr. Loraine that the construction of a railway from Mohammerah to the capital would most materially contribute to the desired end. The reflection will not have escaped you, Sir, that such a project might encounter opposition from Russia. In this case, however, I venture to think that Russian interests in some degree coincide with our own. Russia is perhaps, even more than ourselves, interested in preventing the internationalization of Persian affairs. If we draw back from the task, or are prevented from undertaking it by considerations of Russian interests, the door is left open for its assumption by a third Power. Should that Power be successful in grasping the opportunity offered it and in effecting a serious lodgment in south-western Persia, its Representative at Tehran would automatically acquire an influence and a voice in Persian affairs that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to gainsay. Memorandum by Mr. Loraine. [Foreign Office Despatch No. 70 (13229) of May 6, 1908.] THREE points for discussion stand out clearly from Mr. Ree’s Memorandum : 1.

Inclosure in No. 1.The gist of the Memorandum lies in the last five lines : “ If once there are proper communications in the south the development of the north by Russia will do us no harm, and might, indeed, result in good, but unless communications are improved trade will surely be diverted to the northern outlet.” _ ™ v i , This, as a general proposition, may be accepted, but Mr. Rees does not appear o consider to what extent our interests clash, or coincide, with others which we are bound to respect. These other interests are: (1) Persian; (2) Russian. In view of German activity and ambitions, a third category might be added for German interests. I his, however, is not necessary, because all arrangements made must necessanh possess &gt; consent of the Persian Government; equally, any arrangements affecting the neutra, zone must, in virtue of the Anglo-Russian Convention, possess the acquiescence of Russia. German protest against arrangements made by common agreemen e ween Great Britain, Russia, and Persia would be unavailing. _ The reasons for which it is necessary to consult Persian interests are too o bvious to need discussion. Persia would unquestionably profit by improved communications in the south and south-west, and, what is perhaps equally important, by seem it y o communication along the main arteries of trade, ft is neealess to point out a, ^ n y arrangements for improved communications, which do not provide for security on t e mes of communication, are not only of doubtful benefit to the country, but also ^involve certain loss to the contractors. This at once raises the question of the actual ability o the Persian Government unaided to guarantee security on the roads. This question has been treated in many Reports from this Legation, and it is only necessaiy to summarize the general conclusion, viz., that for the present the Persian Govemment are unable to do so. Persia has to-dav better communications in the north than in the soutn and south west. Especially in the south-west the natural, and particularly the^ agricultura , resources of the country are great, and are capable of great, if not indefinite expansion. Proper communications in the' south and south-west would aid this expansion, and facilitate the flow of trade to an open market, instead of to a closed one in the north. From a Persian point of view they are therefore desirable. The two main causes which have hampered the development in the south aie. (1) geographical; (2) political. This remark must not be construed as a statement that nothing has been cone in the south. Work has been done, in some cases good work; but not as much as would have been the case with a Persia imbued with a true insight into her own needs, fiee enough and strong enough to provide for those needs. As regards (1), the difficulties are great, but not insurmountable. The question is in reality more closely connected with that of the means which Mr. Rees would use to gain his ends. As regards (2), it is a notorious fact that Russian influence has in the past been thrown in the scale to prevent the development of Southern Persia, except hy penetration from the north. The general policy has been to leave the southern portions of Persia in a state of receptivity attendant upon the gradual advance southwards of the Russian trade frontier. This policy has to some extent been frustrated by British action. Mr. Rees is of opinion that Russian development in the north may be regained with equanimity once proper communications are established in the south. ^ J he proposition is true ; but its converse is truer, namely, that proper communications in the south will seriously threaten Russian ascendency in the north. Briefly, then, British and Persian interests demand improved communications in the south; Russian interests run counter. The fact that the Anglo-Russian Convention exists cannot efface the logical divergence of interest; and Russia has the right to be consulted. It must also be boine in mind that of tivo of the roads mentioned by Mr. Rees one, that from Kerman to Yezd, terminates in the Russian zone; the other, from Isfahan to hum, is complete y within it, though this latter is of course covered by the maintenance of existing concessions. . - . . The above considerations are in no way intended to serve as reasons against aiming at action somewhat on the lines suggested by Mr. Rees, but they are facts which must be fully realized if it be desired to form a just estimate of the difficulties such action will encounter. The Foreign Office alone is competent to judge now fai, and in w la direction, it may be possible to conciliate or compensate Russian interests. Two more important points remain to be discussed : — 1. The opportuneness of the present moment for demanding the fulfilment of existing concessions or the grant of fresh ones.2. The fitness of the means suggested by Mr. Rees for the achievement of the object he has in view. 1*. There seems to be some ground for calling in question the logic of Mr. Rees* reasoning that the filing^ of an application for a concession by one party debars a Government fiom bestowing that concession in another quarter. The previous applicant is only morally in a stronger position. Rnough has been said in previous reports about the present temper in Persia in n, regard to toreign concessions; they are regarded with mistrust and suspicion. Unless public opinion veer round in a totally unexpected way, or the Persian public become convinced that it is useless to undertake any enterprise on a large scale without foreign expeit advice and assistance, or the autocracy be restored, no concessions will be granted voluntaiily. To buy them would be so difficult as to admit of that conting'ency beino* ruled out. 0 47 0 In a despatch to the Foreign Office dated the 29th January, 1907, Sir C Spring- Rice wrote :— 0 In the meantime, 1 think it well to bear in mind that the successful prosecution of enterprises in Persia must depend on the foreign Companies being able to conciliate local sentiment. This is an^ extremely difficult matter in the present state of public feeling, and the difficulty is intensified by the passive, and sometimes active, resistance of the Persian Government itself. The experiences of the Russian Legation are even more disagreeable than our own, and the only way in which the Russians have been able to piosecute their enterprises here is by an occasional resort to force, which is facilitated by their imposing military position on the frontier, or by a lavish expenditure of public money, which I fear would be quite out of the question in a country like ours, where such expenditure must be sanctioned, after due inquiry, by the Representatives of the nation. “ Messrs. Lynch, however, may rest assured that the Legation will do all in its power to promote their interests, although it is only fair to warn them beforehand against attaching undue importance to the efficacy of diplomatic intervention. The Persian Government and people appreciate but two arguments—money and force—and neither the one nor the other can be employed by this Legation without authority from His Majesty’s Government. The German Legation may possibly be able, by arriving at an understanding with the leaders of the Popular party, to obtain concessions in various parts of Persia, but the German concessionnaires will in their turn have to deal with the same difficulties as now confront the English and Russian, and which have already proved the ruin of the various Belgian enterprises, with such disastrous financial results.” This statement has lost nothing of its force or accuracy since the daj it was written. All present indications tend to show that this state of things will last for some years to come; the one eventuality in which the Persia of to-day may grant concessions is that of her seeking a foreign loan. I now pass to an examination of the means which Mr. Rees suggests to attain his end. He says : “ The Persian Transport Company .... ought to be encouraged to complete their system of communications as soon as possible. They might also apply for the necessary concessions to the south-east of the present sphere of their activities. Means of transport should be improved by the construction of roads, or eventually, in the distant future, perhaps railways, in the British and neutral zones from the gulf littoral towards Isfahan, Yezd, and Kerman.” To deal individually with some of Mr. Rees’ suggestions it may be observed that the difficulties in the way of opening up the Luristan route via Dizful and Khorremabad have, on examination, proved to be so great that His Majesty’s Government have decided to take no further action for the present in the matter. Along the Isfahan- Kum road carriages and postal fourgons travel without difficulty and regularly. Its continuation is even practicable for carriages as far as Shiraz. Thirdly, the existing road from Yezd to Kerman is, though not a built road, an unusually good one, and perfectly practicable for wheeled traffic throughout its length. Examined from a more general point of view, Mr. Rees’ remedy, with all due respect to him, must, I think, be regarded as no more than a palliative for the defect which he wishes to treat; and, moreover, as a palliative to which success is by no means assured. While we are peddling with road concessions in the south, Russia will be exacting her compensation in the north. And that compensation will be railwavs. [1848/—1] B 2Bail ways are the cure, too, for the south. Mr. Whigham, in his Persian Pioblem, has put the case of road v. railway well. “Mule tracks and roads,” he says, .“are antiquated methods of communication in these days, and it is not at all certain that it is not a sheer waste of money and time to insist on the gradual evolution of trade channels by the various stages of track, road, and rail. Boads in civilized countries have long since ceased to be main arteries of traffic. They can properly be regarded only as feeders. If Japan a few years ago had been persuaded that she must rise gradually to naval power by first building wooden sailing ships, and afterwards ironclads, she would certainly not have reached the position which she occupies to-day. It is hardly less ridiculous to insist that a country must be covered with a network of roads before she is worthy of a railway. It will be remembered that the Grovernment of India was with difficulty persuaded to build railways in Upper Burmah after the last war, the same argument being used that roads must precede railways. lortunately, the railway was strategically necessary, and was therefore built, and proved so successful fiom a commercial point of view' that it is difficult to understand the mental attitude of those who opposed it.” Mr. Whigham further cites the cases of China and Uganda in support of his contention, and adds: “Given railways for the main channels of tiade, roads, as feeders, will speedily follow. But to insist on the road first is really to postpone progress for an indefinite period.” Though this statement may perhaps be criticized in point of detail, its general reasoning is difficult to refute ; nor does the fact that Persia is already provided with roads to a certain extent in any way detract from its force—if anything, the reverse. In Persia, moreover, foreign roads have not been an unqualified success. Carriage roads are a convenience for the rich, but it is very doubtful whether they have given much impetus to trade ; the vast majority of merchandize is mule- and camel-borne, and the muleteer or camelteer naturally prefers a track—which after all meets his requirements—wffiere he pays nothing, to a carriage road, where he is asked to pay tolls and probably charged very high prices for his beasts’ fodder. The Russian Resht- Tehran road is certainly run at a loss, and the exaction of tolls is a certain bar to the conciliation of local sentiment which Sir C. Spring-Rice declares to be so necessary. Railways cut the Gordian knot. They must be protected by some means or other, because repairing damage to them is a costly undertaking, and constant damage is paralyzing ; besides which the native commercial community, which can usually make itself heard, would quickly realize the importance of keeping them open. Moreover, the utility of building a road which is eventually to be converted into a railway is open to serious question. If it is to be ballasted and graded so as to carry a railway, why not build a railway at once ? Even the roads, as Mr. Rees points out, would require a guarantee. If once the principle of guarantees be admitted, it would seem logical and politic not to confine its application to the half-measure of road construction, but to extend it at once to railways. The risk of a railway is undoubtedly the greater, but if, as appears from Mr. Rees’ Memorandum, that risk is eventually contemplated, why not grapple the problem at once ? There is, too, another argument in favour of railways, and that is their inherent political influence. It is wished to have an orderly Persia; at the present moment the Central Government has the greatest difficulty in asserting and maintaining its authority in the provinces ; nothing is better calculated than railways to assist them in this task. The financial problem is, of course, the most difficult of solution. But if Russia and England agree upon a railway scheme, that scheme is morally certain to go through sooner or later ; nor would there be any disadvantage in any surplus customs revenue being pledged to those two Powers for such a purpose. Even if the railway itself did not pay for many years, both Great Britain and Russia would benefit considerably, though indirectly, in the way of trade, especially the former and India. A discussion of what railways should first be built is beyond the scope of this Memorandum; but from the Persian and British point of view it is hardly doubtful that the line from Mohammerah to Tehran via the Biz Valley is of primary importance. It is apparently the line of least resistance from the seaboard to the Iranian plateau; it is the shortest route, it traverses good country, it debouches at what is, for the Persian Gulf, a good port, and not an open roadstead like Bushire. In conclusion, it is undoubtedly desirable to take advantage of, and consolidate with as little delay as possible, the position created by the Anglo-Russian Convention. SoutlvWest Persia is the area on which we should first concentrate our energy. This area being within the neutral zone, all action must be taken after consultation with Russia. Russia has a free hand in the north. But assuming that His Majesty’s Government intend to hold Persia to Nasr-ed-Bin Shah’s pledge in regard to railwayconstruction, we are in a position to negotiate on equal terms with Russia as regards Russkih zmie^^^T^r fr ° m S ° Uth t0 north ^hich falls outside the ssian zone. The road policy has been tested, and cannot be said to have proved very sat^lactory. It ought, therefore, to be taken into serious consideration whether e time has not now come to discard that policy and substitute for it a railway policy. Gulakek, June 16, 1908.

X 3 / (No. 157.) gir 5 ^ ^ Tehran, June 17, 1908. IN reply to your despatch No. 70 of the 9th ultimo, in which you were so good as to forward, for observations, a Memorandum by Mr. Rees, M.P., I have the honour to transmit herewith an admirable and lucid Memorandum, drawn up by Mr. Loraine, after consultation with myself, examining and discussing, in a manner which is entirely in accord with my own views on the subject, the suggestions put forward by Mr. Rees for the utilization of the situation created by the recent Anglo-Russian Convention. Mr. Loraine draws especial attention to the expediency of considering what steps should be taken for the development of means of communication in south-western Persia, and the importance of this is, I venture to think, largely emphasized by the recent discovery of an oil well in Arabistan, the only information in regard to which that has yet reached me I had the honour of reporting in my telegram No. 126 of the 28th ultimo. From such meagre facts as are available it is, of course, impossible to estimate whether oil has been, or will now be, struck in sufficient quantities for the laying of a pipe line and the regular exploitation of the Concession as a paying concern. Should such, however, prove to be the case, a great impetus will infallibly be given to the development of the neighbouring regions, and the port of export, presumably Mohammerah, will at once assume an importance it has not hitherto possessed. In the corner of Persia affected circumstances are peculiarly favourable to the expansion and consolidation of British interests. The firm of Messrs. Lynch Brothers occupies a prominent position at Mohammerah and Ahwaz, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have a steamer service on the Karun, in the hinterland m the Bakhtiari road constructed by British enterprise, the Oil Syndicate is well known in the district through those of its officers who have been conducting the boring operations in recent years, and, lastly, in view of our special relations with the Sheikh of Mohammerah in particular and in a lesser degree with the Bakhtiari Khans, nothing would be more natural than for us to take the lead in the development of the regions which they govern. I entirely agree with Mr. Loraine that the construction of a railway from Mohammerah to the capital would most materially contribute to the desired end. The reflection will not have escaped you, Sir, that such a project might encounter opposition from Russia. In this case, however, I venture to think that Russian inteiests in some degree coincide with our own. Russia is perhaps, even more than ouiselves, interested in preventing the internationalization of Persian affaiis. If we diaw back from the task, or are prevented from undertaking it by considerations of Russian interests, the door is left open for its assumption by a third Power. Should that Power be successful in grasping the opportunity offered it and in effecting a serious lodgment in south-western Persia, its Representative at Tehran would automatically acquire an influence and a voice in Persian affairs that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to gainsay. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr, Loraine. ^ [Foreign Office Despatch No. 70 (13229) of May 6, 1908.] THREE points for discussion stand out clearly from Mr. Ree’s Memorandum 1. The feasibility and expediency of the course he proposes. 2. The opportuneness of the moment for initiating it. 3. The fitness of the means he proposes to attain his ends.

Sir:- -vY'.i . i . iJ,-- I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that he has recently had under consideration the effect which the signature of the Anglo~Russian Convention is likely to exercise, sooner or later, upon the question of railway construction in Persia. As you are aware, the Convention provides that neither of the Contracting Powers shall, without prev ious arrangement between them, oppose the grant of con cessions supported by the other within the limits of T the neutral zone, where equality of commercial opportun ity is likewise recognised to the subjects of third Powers. It may indeed safely be surmised that other Powers will not be slow to appreciate the changed situation, and to seek to turn it to advantage. le Under Secretary of State, India Office. Although ivawy- - ^Although the Russo-Persian Railway Convention has still some years to run the question of future railway construction in Persia and. the pledges made to His Maj esty’s Government by the two late Shahs must not be lost sight of, and a timely decision should be taken as to what concessions it would be most conducive to the inter ests of British policy to obtain for railway construction in Southern Persia. In these circumstances it seems advisable that His Majesty's Government should take into early consideration the question of a possible attempt to extend the Bagdad Railway into southern Persia, with a view to determining whether a concession of this nature to other Powers should be opposed, or whether it should he forestalled by timely action on the part of His Majesty’s Government, who, by securing prior rights of construction, might render an extension of the Bagdad Railway under foreign auspices economically undesirable. Sir E. Grey is unwilling that the history of the Bagdad Railway Concession, which at one time could have been secured to British enterprise,should find a counter part in Persia. Moreover the extension of the Bagdad Railway,(D x/ Railway, as a foreign undertaking, in the direction of the Indian frontier, would on strategic grounds appear to he inadmissible: the grant of such a concession y would compel the opposition of His Majesty's Government, and a sharp diplomatic conflict would ensue, whereas by the exercise of foresight such a crisis might be averted altogether. Turning now to the question of what specific ac tion His Majesty's Government should take to the end in view, it appears to Sir E. Grey that a British con cession for a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz might prove financially advantageous, while it would seem to offer no strategic objections from the point of view of view of the defence of India. Such a line w'ould absorb all the traffic which has hitherto passed from Bushire and Ahwaz to the North of Persia and would result in the material Improvement of the port of Bunder Abbas now in the British sphere and greatly increase its value and importance. The concession might include the right to continue the line to Ahwaz or elsewhere in Arabistan and to effect a junction with the Bagdad Railway - such extension to be left to the discretion of the conces- sionnaire.

An alternative scheme which deserves examination is whether it would he either desirable or practicable to '' ' '' to unite the Indian railway system with the Bagdad hailway. i * This scheme raises strategic considerations which. ' \ \ . ... . } fall Within the province of the Government of India and the Committee of Imperial Defence. It may well be thought expedient, for strategic reasons, to oppose altogether the progress of railway construction towards the Indian frontier. Be this as it may, it would appear that the difficulty of meeting Ger man competition in the neutral zone in Persia is likely to increase from year to year, and it may prove that a railway such as that referred to would, in British hands, be the most effective means of anticipating a German com mercial advance into southern Persia in the future, thus becoming the source of protection rather than of weakness in the defence of India. As to the economic aspects of the scheme, it may be regarded as likely that the existence of such a line would make British co-operation in the Bagdad Railway more wel come to the Germans, since it would increase the volume ofof through traffic. While passengers would hesitate to travel by the Bagdad Railway with the necessity of breaking the journey on arrival at the Persian Gulf, the convenience of a through carriage from Calais to India could not fail to make itself felt: further, the economy of .time would be considerable, and of especial value in the transmission of mails. The objections of the Russian Government might be such as to render the enterprise inadvisable, though these objections could not fairly extend to the British •sphere' of influence; but in Sir E. Grey's opinion there is no reason to believe that they would prove in surmountable, if on mature consideration the enterprise should be deemed advantageous. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the whole question should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial De fence, in order that His Majesty’s Government may be in a position to decide upon a definite line of policy; but he would be glad, before taking further action, to be furnished with the detailed views of Mr. Secretary Morley. TheThe BUb.i jet of British participation in the Bagdad Railway in&amp;y possi'bly raised on the occasion of the ap- proacMng visit of the German Emperor to this country, and, both on this account and for the reasons already explained, it is desirable that a decision on the ques tions raised should not he unduly delayed. I am accordingly to submit that it might be ex pedient, if such a course commends itself to Mr. Morley, to consult the Government of India by telegraph.
