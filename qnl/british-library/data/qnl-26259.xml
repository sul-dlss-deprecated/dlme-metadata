Dear Croft, With reference to the telegram from the government of India of 23rd instant (No. 3077) about i-u’ 01 ! 1 lj ^? S : ^ or (K.L.M.) air service along he Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, the arrangements entered into between the British Overseas Airways Corporation and K.L.M. for the second Dutch service are on a commercial basis and involve a financial guarantee by the former. As we could not agree to an indefinite continuance of such a liability,•it has oeen necessary to make the arrangements terminable ? ne . month s n °tice on either side. We consider bxiat it would be out of keeping with these arrangements to require the Dutch Government to accent v. n of i ‘* I “ IvI * tho additional condition nronosed by the Government of India in the first paragraph of ~ here is no reason to fear 'that the - 'tch will withdraw from this favourable bare*ain unless forced to do so by unforeseen contingencies. t - e h °P e ’ therefore, that the Government of -ndia will not press their suggestion but will agree t0 t ^ ie Government being notified in the terms ' P^ op °sed at ^ the end of your telegram of 17th June. fn 6 +^ n £ e T S r)° n ii7 0Uld ’ in any case? only be panted tne K-D-w. ’in wartime until further notice*’ and Ciie position could be reviewed, if, in the unlikel^ event, the Dutch company should withdraw the 'extra' service for reasons which we considered w ere unjustified or objectionable. W.D. Croft, Esq., C.I.E., C.V.O. India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W. 1. 1 he/ wi~n ~ri • - ' MiThe capacity at our disposal on the second service will be additional to that which has hitherto been, and will continue* to be, available on the existing service. With regard to the suggestion in the second paragraph of the Government of India T s telegram, the position is that two thirds of the whole capacity of the K.L.M. services are now available for our purposes; we think it quite unlikely that the Dutch would agree that we should be able to claim priority for passenger bookings on the remaining third, which is all that is left to them; indeed, they would probably regard such a suggestion as unreasonable. It seems to us that it ought to be possible to deal with cases of real urgency within the capacity now available to us, which is of the order of 7,500 kg. per week between Durban and Karachi. We note the importance which the Communications Department of the Government of India attach to the restoration of the twice weekly frequency of the flying boat service on the stage between Karachi and Singapore.

XXX V72, Addressed to Secy.of State for Foreign Affairs, repeated to Foreign Simla. In the course of interview with Minister for Education, Morray of British Council learnt that it was proposed to hand over one of the English Sehodls in Kabul to American teachers and that efforts to recruit these were being made in 0 . 8 .A. I wonder whether it Y/ould be possible to suggest Tic an authorities that while we would welcome 2 . to American, _ American teachers here ?/e trust great care will be taken in their selection. Choice of right man is important and I think Government of India have had some (? difficulty) with unsuitable types of Americans sent to India as {•? Missionaries) or teachers. F raser fytler 172, May 28 th.r In September last the Government of India proposed that some kind of war-time agreement might be obtained from p i K.L.M. or the Netherlands Government whereby, in return r* 2 . for permission to land on the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf, the K.L.M# would agree to make their aircraft available when required for the carriage of troops or other Government purposes, e.g* priority passages. This proposal was put to the Dutch Government in October, though not in a form which made the grant of permission to land on the Arab coast specifically 0 # dependent upon the conclusion of an agreement of the kind r s.s/n /&lt;fo contemplated. When (apparently in connection with the recent troubles in Iraq) it was suggested to the Government of I n dia that they should agree forthwith to the operation of regular Dutch services along that coast in war-time until &amp; It further notice, the Government of India objected on the ground ^ that such agreement would throw away the most valuable lever p-*. w*, for inducing the Dutch to conclude the war-time agreement. The Air Ministry took a similar line. In these circumstances the Foreign Office were asked to tell the Dutch that, pending the entry into force of the war-time agreement, the existing arrangement would be continued whereby K.L.M. are granted individual permi£s*a for weekly landings at Bahrain and Sharjah. The Foreign Office letter of June 10th below reports that the Nettherlands Legation have stated that, although they , are not in a position to meet fully the requirements of H.M.G. 6 fr*- they are anxious to co-operate with them where possible; and / they therefore hope that permission will be given for K.L.M. to operate via the Persian Gulf without the cbnplusion of a war-time agreement being insisted upon. •' V * \ \ A telegram of the same date from the Government of India (Communications Department) urges the early conclusion of an agreement for the establishment of an additional K.L.M. service on the Palestine-Singapore section of the air route; and recommends for this purpose the withdrawal of the demand .... . for the right to commanded K.L.M. aircraft for the carriage ' * of troops. Although I do not think that the purpose of the v/ar-time agreement has ever been expressed so &amp;&amp; aj to include the ^commandeering” of aircraft, the. concession which the Government of India are now prepared to make seems to remove the ve&amp;apu which the proposed agreement was designed to secure. This morning Sir Francis Shelmerdine came to see Mr. Croft and left with him the attached copy of a telegram from K.L.M, Batavia,to the B.O.A.C. This shows that the Netherlands Government has granted permission for the introduction of a second service on the Singapore-Palestine section; though it appears that this service cannot start until standing permission is given for^operation along the Arab coast. Sir Francis Shelmerdine said that the Air Ministry were now anxious that such pemission should be given. Olctf ft*. J Cy\ 7h&amp; “T It therefore seems that we should telegraph to the External Affairs Department giving them a strong lead^in favour of withdrawing the objections expressed in theA.telegram of May 13th.

West bound service ex^India can barely carry maxis xor Sgypt owing to large volume of troop mails between Singapore ana Cairo* bulk of which are to and from Australia and New Zealand* Air mails from India, both west and east bouEud* seriously inter fered with, and all passengers except a few highest government priority are excluded. 2. We cannot acquiesce In this situation and In British troops and the general public having to use the very slow and irregular sea mail between India and the United Kingdom. Wr foresee* as military situation develops* increased demands for priority passengers and mails. The first essential Is to increase the capacity between Singapore and Cairo and/or reduce weight of troop mails to and from all countries by all or any of the following means* (a) Use for mail transport between Palestine and Singapore all available capacity on existing K.L.M* service. We understand K.L.M* have offered to guarantee reservation of 750 kilogrammes capacity west bound and 500 kilogrammes east bound. (b) Press forward conclusion of agreement for establishment of additional K.L.M* service. We assume that the greatest obstacle to the conclusion of war-time agreement is demand for right to toranic.rd.ccy K.L.M. aircraft for carriage of troops. We recommend this demand, may be withdrawn if they agree to maintain an extra service for Empire communications. We also recommend support for extension of their services to Cairo which will enhance value of Empire communicat ions. (e) Introduce airgraph system for all concessional troop malls Including mails paid, for by voluntary organisations. (d) Until (c) can be brought into effect* limit of weight of letters at concessional rates to J ounce.

It will be recalled that the granting of such permission was to be made dependent on the acceptance by the Netherlands Government of certain stipulations in connexion with cooperation with the British Overseas Airways Corporation. It was also suggested that it would be advantageous if in connexion with the operations of the K.L.M. in'the Persian Gulf a 'war agreement' might be concluded between the Governments of the United Kingdom, India and the Netherlands under which the K.L.M. should render assistance to the joint Y/ar^ effort (vide Lord Halifax’s note to the Netherlands P7 SlX'bltLQ 17th October, 1940, a copy of v/hich was forwarded ' &lt; [T to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter W 10496/4119/27 of 18th October). 3.

I am now to transmit a copy of a note v/hich was left at this department by the Counsellor of the Netherlands Legation on 5th June regarding the 'war agreement'. In presenting this note M. Teixeira pointed out that the Netherlands Government were not in a position to meet fully the requirements of His Majesty’s Government. He trusted, hov/ever, that -the note in question showed that the Netherlands Government Y/ere anxious to cooperate with His Majesty’s Government where possible and expressed the hope that in view of the fact that the proposed Y/artime agreement did not strictly speaking form part of the stipulations to which the Netherlands Government had been required to conform before their request for operation via the Persian Gulf could be granted, His Majesty’s Government v/ould not press for full satisfaction in this connexion before acceding to it. 5. Mr. Eden has considerable sympathy with the position of the Netherlands Government in this matter and he trusts that on political grounds the Goverament of India and the Air Council will now agree to meet the request of the Netherlands Government. 6.

They have four aircraft in the United Kingdom, operating on the Lisbon service (3 D.C. 3’s and 1 D.C. 2 ), which are chartered by the British Overseas Airways Corporation. Priority for I%therland purposes has been agreed to. In addition seven aircraft are in the Netherlands Indies and eight are operating in the West Indies. My Government are of opinion that it will not be difficult to reach agreement on the question of granting priority for passages to persons or freight. F . 'bvxl' hot JUd *jo(‘ %a. J-uAA £ oefoise On the other hand the release of aircraft of the K.L.M., at present used on the Batavia - Lydda service, would meet with grave objections. It is felt that the operation of this line will have to remain entirely in the hands of the K.L.M* as a section for the connexion with the Netherlands after the war. Furthermore, the providing of aircraft on charter terms or otherwise could only be incidentally considered, having regard to the small number of aircraft available in Netherlands Indies and possible needs of the armed The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, l etc., etc., etc. ^ |I[1| .. | . i r ... . •f’n acf ^ ^ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAH LETTER • G rg M *25’ 2 i JUN 1941 FROM SEe«ETARY,extT&gt;&amp;&lt;'»l-OEPT.

In this connexion it may be pointed out, that the K.L.ki. have complained that on the Lydda line they are subjected to restrictions, such as the use of aerodromes, foreign exchange regulations, local transport, the carrying of mail, which do not apply to British lines.

J.4800/261/802, dated 24th April, forwarding a copy of a letter No. 1170, dated 21st, April, fron the Netherlands Minister, regarding the application by K.L.M. for permission for the duration of the i?ar to land at Bahrein, Sharjah and Jiwani. rv^r ikT' ' It was originally the intention that the transfer of the operations of the K.L.M. to the Arabian coast route should depend upon the conclusion of an agreement for the i&gt;erlod of the war, between the Governments of the United Kingdom, India and the Netherlands, under which the K.L.M, would co-operate generally to render assistance to the joint war effort. Foreign Office letters of 17th October, 1940 (No. /. 10496/4119/27)/ and 16th January, 1941 (No. .261/261/802) to the Netherlands Minister make this quite clear* K.h.M. were also required, in order to ensure^tkat there was harmonious working between the Dutch company and the Corporation?and no clash of interests between them when the Arabian coast route was operated, to agree to certain conditions relating to commercial representation , timetables, fares and rates. In his letter of 21st April, the Netherlands Minister confirms that these commercial conditions have been accepted by k.L.M* and on the strength of their acceptance, requests that permission be granted to the K.L.J. for the duration of the war to land at Bahrein, Jharjah and Jiwani. i liie India Office, 1 ^ t. f: r] l 9r m ai:l Q ‘ 5000 dated 6th lay, to the of India, takd -one view tnai acceptance by K.L.M. of these specific conditions is sufficient to justify permission being granted forthwith for regular landings at these three places, and that this may be done without prejudicing the chances of concluding the suggested wartime agreement. From the Air Ministry point of view, there are definite advantages in deferring a decision until we know the reactions of the K.L.M. to certain proposals now under discussion consequent upon the recent decision to reduce the frequency of our krpire air service to once a week. •hen our service has been so reduced, the only means by which the air mail service can be maintained is by making use of the K.L.M., who would have to increase their present frequency between Lydda and Singapore from once weekly to twice weekly, in order to provide the minimum capacity required. /The G.?.

The Dutch have here an opportunity of showing that they are, in fact, willing to co-operate with the air services of the 33ritish Empire for the common interest, along the very lines indicated in Foreign Office letter dated 16th January last to the Dutch Minister, In all the circumstances, it is suggested that we should mark time and let the Dutch prove in this particular instance,that they are at least willing to act in accordance with trie principles suggested as the basis of the agreement, even if the conclusion of the formsi agreement cannot be hurried. . .

We have received a copy of your official reply to the Foreign Office letter and before replying ourselves, we would be glad to have your views on the following suggestions as to the ways in which K.L.M. co-operation could be utilised:- (i) The allocation of priority passages to persons concerned in work of National importance. (ii) The conveyance of priority freight of (iv) The delaying, interrupting or varying temporarily of K.L.M. Schedule Service for the above purpose. Assistance on items (i) (ii) (iii) would be at the specific request of His Maoesty f s Government.

It is hoped that a reply will be received in the near future. In paragraph 3 of your note, Your Excellency enquired to what extent it might be possible for the K.L.M. to render assistance to the joint war effort. In this connexion I have the honour to inform Your ( Excellency that Her Majesty’s Government agree with the thought underlying the proposal that the K.L.M. should, as far as possible, co-operate with the air services of the British Empire in the common interest. They are, 1 therefore, prepared in principle to further the conclusion of an agreement between the Governments of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and India to that end. Having regard, however, to the limited personnel I and material available, it will be necessary to receive more detailed information as to the extent of co-operation visualised, as the K.L.M. would only then be in a position to consider whether efficient assistance can be rendered.

Airways Corporation on tne subject who have a direct interest in this matter. The nroposal v/ill require the Corporation to afford a certain amount of assistance to their competi ors at the stations concerned. This the Corporation are quite ready to do, but they point out that the accommodation at these stations,* particularly Sharjah, is ^ ex&gt; y 1 ^ 1 ® and that it will be necessary for arrangements e to avoid simultaneous night halts by aircraft of bo Companies at the same place. Also, if K.L.M. are to enDo. further facilities at our expense, pressure shoula be put upon them to come to an understanding with the Corporation in the matter of fares and rates. Hiiherto the Dutch Company have shorn a marked disposition to go m for unaer cutting. As a further point it will not do to allow .L.M. to set up their own commercial organisations at the various stations in the Persian Gulf. We have looked at Wilson Young*s letter to you of the 28th September and his draft note to the Nether lands Minister in the light of these considerations. iyg entirely agree with Wilson Young that a watchful eye must be kept on the K.L.M. Their Managing Director, Plesman, who remained in Holland after the _ German invasion,appears to have still a good deal of in fluence in the Company’s activities. He is in close re lations with the Germans by whom he is given a S 00 ^® 811 of rope, and was to our knowledge recently in iDtockholm discussing plans for enabling a connection to be made from there with the K.L.M. service at Baghdad. In these circumstances we should like to take the opportunity of tying the K.L.M. up a little more R.T.Peel Esq. ,C.B.E.,M.C. India Office, Whit eh al1, S.W•1• tightlytightly than they are at present. We should 'be ready as a sop to let them use Sharjah if they would like to do so, although as Wilson Young points out,the Netherlands Legation have not specifically asked for facilities at this place. With regard to the question of making use ofK.L.M. * aircraft for Government purposes when the occasion arises, ^ we think that it would 'be an advantage for the. United Kingdom Government also to 'be included in the arrangements. We suggest, therefore, that paragraphs 2 and 3 of the proposed note to the Netherlands Minister should 'be amen ded to read somewhat as follows subject to the ob servance of the relevant air navi gation regulations M 2. The competent authorities have given very careful consideration to this application, and, animated as they are by the*desire to afford as full co-operation as possible to the Netherlands Authorities, they are happy to agree in principle to the operation of the said service via Bahrein (and Sharjah iih the K.L.M. Company so desire) for the dura tion of the wa^r. In order to ensure that there is har monious working betv/een the K.L.M. and the British Overseas Airways Corporation and no clash of interests between them when this route is followed, it is desired that the K.L.M. should agree (a) that British Overseas Airways Corporation should represent the K.L.M. at Bahrein, Sharjah an£ Jiwani; (b)that the time-tables of K.L.M. should be so arranged that their aircraft avoid night stopping simultaneously with aircraft of the Corporation at the same stations in the Persian Gulf; (c) that the fares and rates for any class of traffic to any part of the routes or in any country served by the tY/o organisations or their associates should be settled in consultation and only altered by mutual agree ment. There is a further point which has arisen in the consideration of this application and which has no doubt also occurred to your Government, namely, to what extent,as a measure of inter-allied co-operation,it might be possible for K.L.M. to render assistance to the joint war effort. There is no doubt that in certain circumstances K.L.M. air craft might be of considerable value for urgent governmental transport purposes. It would, therefore, be advantageous if, in connection with this proposed transfer of the opera tions of K.L.M. to the Arabian Coast route, a war agreement were concluded between the Governments of the United Kingdom, India and the Netherlands under which K.L.M. would in case of need make their aircraft available for these purposes. 3.1 accordingly have the honour to request that Your Excellency will be so good as to inform me whether the Netherlands Government would be willing to enter into such an agreement for the duration of the war. 11 t - I am sending a copy of this letter to Wilson Young and shall be glad if you will let me know in due course if you concur in the amendments which I have suggested above.

Since writing that letter you will have seen the Netherlands Minister* s note of the 6th September, of which we sent you a copy under Foreign Office No. W 10165/4119/27 on the 21st September, requesting that K.L.M. should be granted a permanent authorisation to fly via Bahrein. The note does not refer specifically to Sharjah. 2. We have noted that in their telegram No. 2675 of 'the 24th July the Government of India strongly urged that they should be permitted to authorise K.L.M. to use Sharjah aerodrome either (a) on special occasions or (b) regularly for the duration of the war. We have also noted that Burkett in his letter to you of the 2nd August stated that the Air Ministry would see no objection to the acceptance of proposal (a) but that they considered that K.L.M. should be required to make a formal application through the diplomatic channel for any facilities they desired in respect of (b). 3. Our own view is that K.L.M. generally require a watchful eye kept on them (we have had cases of evasion of censorship and message carrying by pro-German elements in the service), but that, as they are our allies, we should certainly give them the facilities they desire and should do so with good grace as quickly as possible. At the same time the Government of India* s latest proposal that the opportunity might now be taken to effect a war agreement with K.L.M. or with the Netherlands Government seems to us eminently reasonable and we do not see why we should not insert a suggestion of this kind in our reply to the Netherlands ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL No. 40 '^' 1 2 OCT 1940 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL DEPT.

The best route is the one via Iran; however, it appears that the Iranian Government still refuses to grant permission to fly across Iranian territory. As a result the K.L.M. now flies via Bahrein, but permission for each separate journey has to be applied for in Simla. Applications put forward in this manner are expensive and cause much inconvenience. Therefore, the Director General for Air at Simla has suggested that application for a permanent permission to fly via Bahrein should be made with His Majesty’s Government in London.

Dear Peel, j: The India Office have sent us a copy of telegram No.T/247 of 11th August from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the use of Sharjah by K.L.M. I do not think there is any chance at all that K.L.M. would agree to the Political Resident’s suggestion to transfer or hire their aircraft to British Overseas Airways Corporation for operation on the route to the Par East. In fact I do not, at the moment, quite see what reasons we could advance to the Dutch in support of this suggestion. Yours sincerely, R.T.Peel Esq., C.B.E.,M.C.

Dear Peel, Please refer to correspondence under India Office reference PZ.4198/40 in regard to the use of Sharjah Ly K.L.M. during the war. I am sorry that you have not had an earlier reply to your letter of the 9th July, hut it was necessary to_ consult the Service side of the Air Ministry on this subject in the first instance. I now write to say that so far as the Air Ministry is concerned there is no objection to the acceptance of the proposal at paragraph 2(a) of telegram No.2673 from the G-overnment of India: although we think K.L.M. should he required iko make a formal application through the diplomatic channel Ifor any facilities they desire in respect of (h). I am not Vure that it is quite correct to say that the Government of India strongly urge the granting of permission for the regular use of Sharjah hy K.L.M. In fact they say that the question of regular use is not likely to arise. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf does not, however, share this view. His telegram ^ No.594 of the 27 th July suggests that application for facili- ties for regular operation may he expected. I am sending a copy of this letter to Eyres at the Foreign Office.

A copy o, an interim reply which has been sent to the Foreign Qfiice stating that the Government of India is being consulted in the matter, and recommending that permission should not be given for an Italian air service to operate along the Arab Coast route, is also enclosed. i am to request that Lord Zetland may be informed as soon as possible whether the Government of India are willing to accord facilities for the operation of the. proposed service across India and, if so, whether they agree that the permit to be given on their behalf to the Italian Government might tame the form of the attached draft which, save for Clause 2 - the inclusion of which is explained in the following paragraph - follows the permit communicated to the German Government in April last in respect of the operation of a German air service across India, suitably tXMPY SENT BY AIR MAIL modified/ The Secretary to the Government of India, Communications Departmentmodified in view of the fact that Italy is a party to the International Convention for Air navigation, 1919. As regards Clause 2 of the proposed permit, I am to invite reference to the Anglo -Italian Convention of December 7th, 1934, relating to the Establishment of Air Transport Lines, to which India was a party in view of the inclusion of Aden among the places mentioned in Article 4, which, it was agreed, might be used by the Italians either as terminal points or as Places of transit on more extended air routes. Having regard to the fact that the Government of India is no longer responsible for the administration of Aden, and al^ to the possibility that it might be held by the Italian Government that the reciprocal rights conferred on British air services by Article 3 of the Convention do not now, if it was originally intended that they should, apply to the aircraft of an Indian company, I am to suggest that it would be desirable to male specific provision in any permit to oe given to the Italian Government for the grant of reciprocal iaciii'ties 'to the ^irpr•--P+ tu dirci&amp;xt of a company nominated by the Government of India. ihe Burma Oilice is understood to to consult the Government of Burma with Italian Governments enquiry. be taking steps regard to the I am, sir, four obedient Servant,♦ iUconomic &amp; Overseas E. &amp; 0.502/40 Sir February, 1940. % aft 5 J / YVith reference to your letter of 20rd January, 1940* No.W.833/803/27, relative to the proposal of the Italian Ala Litturia Company to extend the present Rome- Basra air service to Bangkok, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose copy of a letter which has been sent to the Government of India on the subject. 2 * With regard to the suggestion that the Italian Company should make use of the route followed by Imperial Airways along the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, I am to say that Lord Zetland fully shares the objections- to such a proposal which have been expressed only recently by the Political Resident and by the Government of India, the former in his express letter of the 27th September, No.C/492 (enclosure in India Office letter No.1.2.6257/39, dated 13th October) regarding the visit of Signor Tenturini to Bahrein, and the latter in paragraph 3 of their telegram of the 9th December, No.2286 (enclosure in India Office letter No .1.2.7732/39, da'ced 11th December) regarding the request of M.Roosenburg for visa facilities in connection with the establishment of a K.L.K. service through Bahrein, 3* Inasmuch as the Italian Company, according to the Government of India, are reported in the press to have already obtained permission for the use of the Persian route, the position in this as in other respects is much the same ^ as when in 1936 Royal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.M.) sought permission to use the Arab Coast route, and the difficulties pointed out by the Foreign Office when refusing permission in their letter to the Dutch Minister of the 25th September, 1936 (No.E.5895/377/91, retain their force, so far as Lord Zetland is aware. It is not improbable that the Air Ministry will feel that the strategical objections to admitting a foreign company to the use of the Arab route (which of course were not conveyed to M.van Swinderen in 1936) are if anything increased at the present time, and that any attempts by Italian (and Dutch) Companies to take advantage of the war-time difficulties of Imperial Airways should not be encouraged. Lord Zetland hopes therefore that when the times comes to reply to the Italian Ambassador after receipt of the views of the Governments of India and Burma Lord Halifax will be able to communicate to the Italian Ambassador a polite but firm refusal of the facilities desired on the Arab Coast; and while the reply might, if thought desirable, be substantially on the lines of that made to the Dutch Minister in September, 1936, His Lordship would strongly deprecate any hint that the position might be reconsidered if the Company failed to obtain facilities through iersia. 4.

He asked if there would be any difficulties. 2. I told Mr. Marais that so far as ^atar v/as concerned the only immediate prospect was for Petroleum Development (^atar) Limited to charter the machine, v/hich could then be flown to t^atar as the Company f s own machine under the terms of their concession. Por H.A.C.S. to operate a service to Q,atar v/ould involve negotiating with the Shaikh - and probably large mone tary demands from him. Mr* Marais admitted that the matter was scarcely worth pursuing at the moment since development in Q.atar has been arrested by the war, and that Oil Company operations there with 12 British and American personnel and f one derrick offeredno scope for air transport. ( 3. As for Hasa I reminded Mr. Marais that any idea of M.A.fi.S. operating a service would involve an approach to Ibn Saud through the foreign Office. I thought that the foreign Office would be extremely reluctant to make such an approach and that Ibn Saud would not regard it favourably. 1 said however that this was a matter outside my province. sd.

Dear Residency, -our express letter No. C/492 of 27th September, 1939, to the Secretary of State for India about the visit of Signor Venturini to Bahrein. It is regretted that the Political Agent at Bahrein did not receive prior warning of the arrival of Signor Venturini in Bahrein. As the Political Agent will now be aware, the Acting Consul informed him in an air mail letter No, 26/7/8 of the 18th September, that he had that day granted a visa to Signor Venturini. It was understood that Signor Venturini intended to spend two or three days in Basra, and he seems in fact to have done so. The Acting Consul therefore saw no special reason to telegraph to the Political Agent. It is evident that the letter did not catch the aeroplane it was intended to catch, owing possibly to delay in the censor’s office, despite the obviously official character of the communication. As regards the general question of granting visas in war-time which the Political Agent, Bahrein, raises in paragraph 2 of his express letter to the Political Resident, it should be noted that, except in the case of visas for the United Kingdom, no fresh instructions modifying the existing regulations have been received as a result of the outbreak of war. This, and the fact that Signor Venturini, although he only applied for the visa in person on 18th September/ The Residency, Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE.&lt;er- September, had been informed of the terms of your approval of his application immediately upon receipt of your telegram No. T 182 of 23rd August, would have made the withdrawal of his facilities very difficult, except on some very solid ground advanced by you; and we note that you did not think, fit to take the initiative in this direction. We would mention too that wehad had instructions to be very careful to avoid any provocation to Italy and to see that the Iraqis conformed with our attitude. In the absence of fresh instructions regarding visas for other parts of the Empire and territories under British control, and having regard to the fact that the applicant was not an enemy alien and that, as indicated in paragraph 4 of the Political Resident’s telegram No. 182 of 23rd August, he was to be kept under observation during his stay in Bahrein, it was not considered that, in the absence of any initiative from you, the approval of the issue of a visa of strictly limited validity to Signor Venturini needed reconsideration in the event of war. In connexion with paragraph 3 of the Political Resident’s letter, the Acting Consul was assured categorically by Messrs. Dwyer and Company, who are the local agent for the Ala Littoria Company, and are a firm under Brit ish management usually considered reliable, that Signor Venturini was only visiting Bahrein in order to appoint a booking agent there, and that there was no question at present of extending the service beyond Basra. Nevertheless, we are not surprised to hear that his Company are thinking of exploiting to their own advantage the situation in which the war has placed the Imperial Airways. The Acting Consul applied to Messrs. Dwyer rather than to Signor Venturini direct because shortly after making his original application for a visa, Signor Venturini left for Haifa and remained there for several days, no doubt in order to ascertain what the attitude/ r) attitude of his country would be as a result of hostilities* ^ i r* i W d y, ^ • \ oKth^ outttreak . o y -.-J ¥e are very sorry to have caused you so much trouble and quite appreciate your anxiety not to have aliens arriving in your midst without due warning.

USE CF THE ARAB CCAST BY FOREIGN AIRCRAFT. Our policy as regards the use of the Arab Coast, more especially the Trucial Coast, by foreign aircraft was thoroughly reviewed at the time when it was considered necessary to change the route of Imperial Airways from the Persian to the Arab side of the Gulf in 1932. (Reference P.Z.5019/32 for full account of the views then expressed by the interested Departments). Our policy has been governed by three considerations: (l) The difficulty of guaranteeing security in the Trucial Sheikdoms. Our own police measures are on a very small scale, and in our Treaty relations with the Sheiks we -■ttn-ekirtook not to interfere in their internal affairs. On the other hand, were we to secure for foreign air services equal facilities from the Sheiks, we should have to guarantee their security (unless they were to be left to take their own precautions themselves, which we could not allow) . Thus we should assume responsibilities which it would/2 would be difficult to carry out without infringing our agreements with the Sheiks. We must, therefore, keep such facilities that are granted down to a minimum and make it a cardinal point to insist that in so far as facilities are granted, foreign companies o-teould adhere to the advice and instructions of the local British Authorities on both sides of the Gulf*., (forced landings on the Persian side are lUM l»&lt; not impossibleand that their services aro p4gifted- down to routes and landing grounds aeoording to tho pl-a.no of which we ay»- always fully informed in advance. (2) The maintenance of the Maritime Trao-pa. This is largely governed by the foregoing observations, but it is to be borne in mind that too extensive facilities might always be made a pretext by a foreign power for naval penetration of the Gulf. Italy has been specifically referred to in this connection. (3) The need for obtaining reciprocal facilities for our Air Companies from foreign powers (this is more a matter of concern to the Foreign Office than to us). Downright refusal of facilities is to be avoided, since, on the whole, Great Britain is more dependent on foreign powers for air facilities than vice versa owing to her geographical isolation./% * I ho # 3naa/.:q/34 istn atpte^*3P 1939 * Consul General, Bughirg, Iran * Slr f The undereigneB, 'doy&amp;l mtch Airlines (F.l.M*), have the honour to request that they be granted the neaeeeary author isation for their alraraft in regular service between lister* daas ; A iid &gt;&gt;atavla 9 to land at the aerodromes of Muharra% and Gwadux, as also to fly over the territories of Muscat and Cisan* They also request that smh authorisation be extended to aircraft of the a ©tap any on special flight §« The registration mark** ox the aircraft, actually flying on the thrice weekly service Asseterden^Batavie are the following* M-aLI m-xw PH* AM m*idM IHUAIT iTT*Al^Z PH-AU mmjaM AboyMt H!-AI0 PH* ARE M*AdP m~AT£ Pg^ABB PH*ACH PE-A 1 E PH* AEG PH* AST W&amp;rn£m m*Am PH*ASM The aeroplanee are , xseriaan-built »ouglae type fx;-3 t twin engined, with a crew of five* The K*L*M* would greatly appreciate it, if through the intensediary of H.B.M* Consul General at Buehire ^aid author isation could be obtained from His glghneee the dultan ot\ ! x aV Muscat and Oman, and Hie Excellency the sheikh of Bahrain,&gt; * x as the authorisation in our poeseesioa is valid only till the 3lst of December 1939* W« have the honour to be.

Sir, In your note No. 448 of 23rd March, 1936, you were so good as to inform me that the Royal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.M. ) had approached His Majesty 1 s Consul'* General at Bushire with a view to obtaining permission to fly over Muscat and Bahrain and to use the aerodromes at Gwadur and Muharraq for emergency purposes. As a consequence of this application, permission was granted in due course by the Sheikh of Bahrain for certain American built Douglas, type DC-2 (twin engined), aircraft of the Royal Dutch Air Line, bearing the following Registration Marks: 'PH-AKI PH-AKK PH-AKL PH-AKN PH-AKO PH-AKP PH-AKQ PH-AKS” to land in Muhairaq and to fly over Bahrain. 2. Since this permission was accorded, however, the Sheikh of Bahrain has drawn the a ftp ntion of His Majesty’s Government to certain cases in which aircraft belonging to the Royal Dutch Air Line bearing registration marks other than those mentioned above have landed at Bahrain. For instance on the 30th November, 1936 Jonkheer R. de Marees van Swinderen, G.C.V.O. etc., etc., etc. a/a K*L.M. air liner bearing the registration mark PH-ALP, was compelled, after a wireless notification, to make an emergency landing at Bahrain. Although this machine was not one of the aircraft authorised to use the Muharraq. aerodrome nevertheless, in the circumstances, the Bahrain Government, as a friendly action, permitted it to refuel and proceed on its way without delay. 3. Again, on the 12th December, 1936 another unauthorised K.L.M. aircraft, bearing the registration mark PH-AKR made an emergency landing at Bahrain through shortage of petrol, but was -permitted to proceed. 4. The landings of these unauthorised aircraft have been the subject of a formal protest by the Bahrain Government and, in view of the Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft made by His Rxcellency the Sheikh of Bahrain, (a copy of which was sent to you in my note No. S 7233/17/91 of the 23rd December, 1935,) I have the honour to suggest that the fact that this protest has been made should be brought to the notice of the Company and that steps should be taken to make certain that they understand that it is incumbent upon them to obtain a special authorisation for each individual aircraft which may require emergency landing facilities at the aerodrome at Muharraq, or permission to fly over Bahrain.

I understand that Sterndale Bennett discussed this matter over the telephone the other day and explained that our view here is that we should he acting rather gratuitously if at this stage we addressed a warning to the Dutch to keep away from Sharjah merely on the grounds that on a recent flight one of the K.L.M. pilots telegraphed that, through shortage of petrol, he might have to land there. We should also . we think, be acting rather prematurely if such a warning were based on a surmise arising from the fact that K.L.M. planes are now reported to be doing the stretch between Jask and Basra in one hop. We feel that if the positions were reversed we would resent receiving such a communication. /We M.J. Clauson, Esq.&lt;g' We think, therefore, that subject to the views of the India Office and Air Ministry it would be wiser to confine our communication to the Netherlands Legation to the matter of the landings of unauthorised machines at Bahrain, on the lines of paragraph 2 of your letter under reference, and to leave any communication about Sharjah (the position there having been fully explained to them in our note No. E 5895/377/91 of the 25th September, a copy of which went to India Office officially at the time) until an actual landing took place. We see no objection to the Political Resident being authorised to issue instructions about the detention of all unauthorised aircraft at Sharjah, but in the light of the foregoing observations you will perhaps consider that your draft telegram to Fowled will need some recasting.

In reply I am to say that Lord Swinton concurs in the Political Resident’s suggestion that in future any Netherlands aircraft making such landings at Bahrein or Sharjah should not be allowed to proceed, without reference to him. 3. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am Sir Your obedient Servant The Under-Secretary of State Political Department, India Office, I London, S.W-1r Minute Paper. POLITICAL Department. Please see telegram 'belov; from Colonel Fowle regarding the landing of unauthorised Dutch K.L.M. aircraft at Bahrein. The Express Letter dated 23rd December, which is referred to therein, has not yet arrived, hut we need not perhaps delay action on that account. The present position in regard to the activities of Royal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.M.) on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf is that the Company have received a written permission from the Sultan of Muscat to fly certain authorised aircraft over his territories on the north side of the Gulf of Oman and to land in Gw.adur, and from the Sheikh of Bahrein to fly certain authorised aircraft within the limits of Bahrein and to land at the Muharraq Aerodrome in Bahrein. The Company recently applied, through diplomatic channels, for permission to make use of the landing ground at Sharjah, hut as will he seen from the letter dated 25 th September 1936 (P.Z.6932/36) addressed to the Netherlands Minister, we have hedged on this question* such permission could not in any case he granted under the terms of our existing Air Agreement with the Sheikh of Sharjah. Taken by themselves, the incidents reported by l Colonel Fowle are not very serious, and it is probable that the aircraft concerned are those used by the Dutch on their regular service between Amsterdam and Batavia, and for which the Company have omitted to obtain the necessary prior authorisation. This situation could perhaps be regularised by bringing the Sheikh*s protest to the notice of the Company and reminding them of the necessity for obtaining prior authorisation for all 47«’'5 5000 5.36 aircraft/tiM -ih', 2 . aicraft used on their regular services which are likely to make use of the Bahrein Aerodrome. If, however, the position is as stated in paragraph 2 of the telegram, some action would appear to 'be necessary in order to avoid unfortunate incidents, and to ensure that our existing agreements with the Sheikhs concen.ed are upheld. The action proposed by Colonel Fowle will probably have the desired effect, and after discussion with Mr. Brenan I submit a draft d. o. letter to the Foreign Office and a draft telegram to Colonel Fowle, which might issue if the Foreign Office agree. d k tu *0 f L hJumL it a* ^ Cvt rtvt*) . { ({Jaa ^ /( : 4 i\l(K (Ua)^)(m.

P.Z.2370/36 Department. 2 ^ ^luli KCt #/-4 *V(/( lu 4 ^ 7X foij ^ At the time of the opening of the British Civil Air Boute along the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, enquiries were received from the French and Dutch Governments asking whether similar facilities would be granted to their aircraft^ The matter was discussed at an interdepartmental meeting in X July 1932, and after considerable discussion it was decided that it would be politically undesirable to refuse such requests. For the moment, however, the grant of facilities was confined to flights over Bahrein and Gwadur and the use of the Muharraq and Gwadur aerodromes. In regard to the intermediate stage it was felt that it was undesirable to grant any facilities until more experience had been gained. In reporting the results of the meeting to the Government of India the following passage is relevant; u as regards Shsagah, we are, of course, fully alive to the undesirability of admitting foreigners to the Trucial area, though ultimately the same facilities as are enjoyed by Imperial Airways may have to be accorded them. For the moment, therefore, we propose to inform the Dutch that until the question has been more thoroughly examined and the new route tested by practical experience it is impossible to say what facilities, if any, can be afforded to their aircraft. n (P.Z.4521/32). In reply the Government of India agreed with this view and stated 'in addition to necessity of testing route by practical experience before Dutch or French can use Shaqah, Sheikh’s concurrence will have to be obtained as present agreement only covers Imperial Airway machines' . (fTz The Dutch Minister was therefore informed: *With r egard to the intermediate stage between Bahrein and Gwadur numerous difficulties have yet to be overcome and it will not be possible to tell what facilities, if any, can beafforded to the Royal Dutch Services until the question has been thoroughly examined and the new route put to the test of practical experience. 1 * ('Tz, The Dutch have now returned to the charge (see the Dutch Minister^ letter below) and as Imperial Airways have been flying along this route regularly for the last four years it would appear impossible to answer his letter along the lines used in 1932. It was recognised then that facilities at Shsi^ah would ultimately have to be granted and the moment now seems to have come for doing so. We shall, of course, have to consult the Government of India and 1iie Political Resident before making this exception fa/o our policy of excluding all foreigners from the Trucial area. it will also be necessary to approach the Sheikh of Sharjah before we can grant the desired facilities, as our present agreement with him only covers British aircraft. Provided, however, that the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry agree, we might approach the local authorities along these lines. Our permission to K.L.M* would, of course, be subject to the two conditions envisaged, in 1932: (1) that they should fly along a specified route, / him. )h Mai hiLox h 4c \ tfjj-s Gune presumably Bahrein, Sharjah and GwadunJ and ( 2 ) that they will give an undertaking to comply strictly with any advice which they might receive from the British officials in that area. By this means it should be possible to control the workings of K.L.M. and to guard against any local difficulties and pr event any harm arising through the introduction of foreigners to the area. It may, however, be difficult at this stage to prescribe a definite route. It is apparently not yet the intention of K.L.M* to make regular flights along the Arab route and they^ only wish for facilities at Sharjah for emergency purposes. , ? a-ao nau pr-opoaolto enquire as to their exact P 'K l indentions, but we could probably insist upon their flying direct/ V, to''** M Am 'W««4««K ' vh *‘' , ./. uTImm *&gt;*$1Department. 4424 5000 1/36 direct irom Sharjah, to Jask on the occasions when they do use the former aerodrome. This, presumably, would entail flying over the Musandim Peninsula, but the objections to this seem largely to have been removed lately and it is; unlikely that they will have any difficulty in obtaining permission from the sultan of Muscat. Before consulting the Government of India it seems desirable to find out whether the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry agree with our views and draft letters consulting them are therefore attached. o '9 7/L' ^ Ui com^A- MtU. &amp; ii&gt; fimsUJih ^ (pCiam L*/ ^ Com \aaam*/ fat\ IhtAr HP'-'?

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to Foreign Office letter of 2nd April, No.E.1678/377/ 91 covering a note from the Dutch Minister enquiring whether permission can be granted to K.L.M. to use the Sharjah Aerodrome. 2. It will be remembered that the question of granting facilities to foreign air lines was exhaustively discussed at an inter-tlepartinental meeting at the Foreign Office on 19th July 1932. As a result of this discussion the Dutch Minister was informed (see Foreign Office letter of 31st August 1932, No.E*4359/3307/65) that whilst His Majesty’s Government were prepared to apply to the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikh of Bahrein on behalf of the Netherlands Government for facilities in their territories on certain specified conditions (which were subsequently accepted by the Dutch Minister in his letter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of 24th September 1932^ His Majesty’s Government could not say what facilities, if any, could be afforded to the Royal Dutch Service in r egard to the intermediate stage between Bahrein and Gwadur until the question had been more thoroughly examined and the new route put to the test of practical experience. 3. As Imperial Airways have now for some years made use of the air route and the aerodrome at Sharjah, the Marquess/ The Secretary, Air Ministry.Marquess of Zetland considers that it is no longer possible to reply as in 1932 to the Dutch Minister’s note at present under consideration,and it will therefore be necessary to re-examine the matter. He would xx)int out in this connection that the present agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Sharjah does not, in fact, cover the use of the Sharjah aerodrome by other than British aeroplanes, and that it would therefore be necessary for His Majesty's Government to extend their agreement with the Sheikh before they are in a position to comply with the Dutch request. Subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry His Lordship accordingly proposes to forward the papers to the Government of India and the political Resident, to enquire whether they now see any objection to the use of Sharjah aerodrome by the foreign companies (on conditions similar to those already laid down in respect of Bahrein and Gwadur), and to request that, if they do not, the Political Resident will take the necessary steps to approach the Sheikh. 4.

As a result of this discussion the Dutch Minister was informed (see Foreign Office letter of 31st August, No.E 4359/3/&gt;07/65) that whilst H.M.G. were prepared to apply to the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikh of Bahrein on behalf of the Netherlands Government for facilities in their territories on certain specified conditions^which were subsequently accepted by the Dutch Minister), H.M.G. could not -at^4»hat-_mome-nt say what facilities, if any, could be afforded to the Royal Dutch Service in regard to the intermediate stage between Bahrein and Gwadur until the question had been more thoroughly examined and the new route put to the test of practical/practical experience. 3,As Imperial Airways have now for # some years made use of the air route and the aerodrome at Sharjah, the Marquess of Zetland considers that it is no longer possible to reply as in 1932 to the Dutch Minister's note at present under consideration, and it will therefore be necessary to reeenoidor the matter. He is^~trhogoi‘oi*e ^prepared to consult the Government of India and the Political H^sident in the Persian Gulf as-to the desirability of granting th-d-HufrchraTni st er 1 s reqy^slr. He CM itlM would point out ^hdmev-er^ that the present agreement between H.M.G, and the Sheikh of Sharjah does not, in fact, cover the use of the Sharjah aerodrome by other than British aeroplanes, and that it w~iH therefore be necessary for H.M.G, to extend their agreement with the Sheikh before they are in a position to comply with the Dutch request. Subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry His Lordship thoroforo proposejto enquire whether, in the view of the Government of IndiaN^nd the Political Besident, the moment has cbs^e to make an exception in the policy ofX^xcluding foreigners * from the Trucial Coa^t area.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Royal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.M.) have approached the British Consul General at Bushir with a view to obtaining permission to fly over Muscat and Bahrain and to use the aerodromes at Gwadur and Muharraq for emergency purposes. The KVL. r • are anxious to obtain permission to use the Sharjah aerodrome for the same purpose.

I believe you discussed this question with Mr* Brenan on the telephone and that you gathered from him that an approach from the Dutch G-overnment may shortly be expected through diplomatic channels. It seems unnecessary, therefore, to take any action on Colonel Fowled letter at P. 2.1842/36, and we might confine ourselves to sending a copy of it to Mr. Brenan and Mr. Burkett. As regards the authorisations for Muharraq and Gwadur, you will see that the former has been received and that the latter has been obtained and we shall, no doubt, shortly receive a copy. As the K.L.M. made their application direct to Colonel Fowle he will presumably send the original authorisations direct to K.L.M.

Moes, Inspector General of the K.L.1J. &gt; passed through Bushire. I had him up for lunch and we had an informal conversation on this subject. He is a very pleasant individual as axe most of the Dutchmen I have met. 3 # jn the first place Mr. Moes said that there was no particular urgency for his Company to move from the Persian to the Arab side, and that they might never 4o so as the Persian side, from the flying point of view, suited them somewhat better. Their present arrangements with the Iranian Government were roughly on the basis of a 3-monthly notice and for the moment things were going fairly smoothly. There was, however, no guarantee that at some time in the future the Iranian authorities might not either refuse them permission to continue flying, or make considerable difficulties for them. The Bushire aerodrome, too, was no means satisfactory. In these circumstances the K.L.1I. would like a second string to their bow in the shape of permission to fly down the Arab Coast. 4 . On the subject of the Trucial Coast Mr. Moes stated categorically (what I rather envisaged in paragraph 3 (2) of / J.G.kfalton Esquire,GB.,MG., The India Office, London.-2 of my Express Letter quoted above} that the hop from Bahrain to Gwadur was far too long for their machines and that the K.L.M. would definitely want permission to use the Sharjah and , _ aerodrome regularly^/to fly across the Ras Musandum peninsula. He added that as a matter of fact they already flew over the tip of the peninsula, (a glance at the map will show that this is the direct route between Jask, where they have one of their aerodromes, and Bushire), and suggested that apart from other considerations it might be as well to regularise the position. He said that if they gave up the Bushire aerodrome they might still retain the one at Jask (though of course this depended upon the Iranian Government) and fly from Bagdad to Bahrain and thence to Jask instead of to Gwadur. But even in this case they would want landing facilities at Sharjah. He said that while he quite understood when first we opened the Arab Air Route we were unable to give permission for his Company to land at Sharjah, he hoped now that the Route had been in operation for some years there would be no difficulty about this. He himself had flown in Imperial Airways up and down the Arab Route on various occasions and understood that the Shaikhs welcomed the presence of aircraft and that there was no likelihood of trouble arising. 5. with regard to the Trucial Coast I stated that naturally I could not commit myself as to whether His Majesty’s Government would give the necessary permission, though doubtless his Company would take the matter up through their Legation in London. That in the meantime we had just obtained the necessary permission for the IC.L.M. aircraft to land at Bahrain and Gwadur (I enclose a copy of an Express Letter / rLetter, No.c/87-13/4 dated the 19th February 1936, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, with enclosures, and copies of Muscat telegram No.32 of 17th February and No.40 of 2nd March 1936 respectively.

Department/ When oommunieating the Bahrein^Muscat Civil Air Navigation Regulations to the Dutch Government, the Foreign Office asked that the Royal Dutch Air Line should apply in accordance with paragraph 1(2) for the necessary special authorisation for each aeroplane in order to regularise their passage over Muscat territory and their use of the aerodrome at Gwadur. The K.L.M. have now applied to colonel Foy/le, and he has asked whether it is intended that permission should he granted to the K.L.M. to fly over the Arabian territories of the Sultan(^ b cCovO^ The application does not refer specifically to the Arabian territories; therefore it seems justifiable to assume that K.L.M. propose to continue to use the Persian route ; until yiq have definite proof to the contrary. There is no point in encouraging them to change over to the Arab route which, as Colonel Fowle pointed out, would raise a number of difficult points. I think we might reasonably expect the Dutch Government to consult us before doing so in view of the undertaking v/hich they gave in 1932 (see papers f laggedat P.Z.5881/32).

(2) I am not quite clear whether it is intended th&amp;t permission shall be given to the fUL.M. to fly over the Arabian territories of the Sultan. If not, their machines after leaving Bahrain will have to fly round the tip of the Has Musandum peninsula, thus considerably increasing the length of their flight to Cwadur, which Is already a very long one, and will be entirely over the sea, in land machines. It may be that the K.L.v., by permission of the Iranian Covern- ment, intend to continue using Jask; but even so, if they have to fly round the peninsula and not across it, the length of their flight will be appreciably increased. If permission is granted to the K.L.SI. to fly over the peninsula, they will necessarily have to be given permission to fly over the Trucisl Coast, since it is only the extreme tip of the penin sula which belongs to Muscat, and further South there is a corridor independent of Muscat, running from the Persian Oulf to the Gulf of ^an. If it is intended to permit the K.L.M. to fly over the Trucial Coast and the Ara Mm territories of the Sultan, then for authorizr tion for the latter area, please see Muscat Civil Air Agreement paragraph II. 1 U).

Subject to the views of the Marquess of Zetland, Sir Samuel Hoare feels that it is desirable to explain to the Netherlands and French Governments that the failure to complete paragraph (c) of Schedule II attached to the conditions governing the use of the aerodrome at Gwadur is of no practical importance at present in view of the existence of special agreements between Imperial Airways Limited and the Dutch and French air transport companies. He has accordingly included a paragraph to this effect in each of the enclosed drafts. 3. In the draft to the Netherlands Minister, Sir Samuel Hoare has also thought it desirable to give some explanation/ Under-Secretary of State, India Office.nra-Th explanation of the fact that the charges to he made under Schedule II attached to the conditions governing the use of the aerodrome at Muharraq have not yet heen determined. In the case of aircraft engaged in public transport it would appear sufficient to state that as Imperial Airways are at present the only air transport company using Bahrain, the necessity for determining these charges has not yet arisen. Similar considerations apply in the case of privately- owned aircraft and sir Samuel Hoare would suggest, subject to the views of Lord Zetland, that there may be some advantage in drawing attention to the fact that the Sheikh of Bahrain does not at present permit private flights over his territory. 4.

Dear Clauson, Before he went to Geneva Sterndale-Bennett asked me to write in confirmation of what he said to you on the telephone the other day about the question of communicating the Bahrain Air Navigation Regulations to the Dutch Minister. 2. As you know, when we first came to consider your letter P.3.5051/35 of the 29th July to Rendel, Sterndale- Bennett thought that we should be able to fall in with your views and refrain from sending the Bahrain regulations to the Minister unless he specifically asked for them. However, when he came to go into the matter more deeply and read the earlier correspondence on the subject, he came to the conclusion that it really was not possible for us to attempt to withhold them in view of the explicit promise given in our note of November 1933. If on reconsideration of the matter you still von cannot accree to the regulations being sentto the Minister, we can only suggest that you should take the matter up with us officially. Our own feeling is that as both His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh are already committed to granting the Dutch permission to fly over Bahrain any time that they may make an application to do so, it is unlikely that the mere communication of the regulations would lead them to decide to transfer their air route to the southern shore of the Gulf. 4. I had intended to send you over herewith drafts of the note to the Duoch Minister and of a despatch to the Embassy in Paris instructing them to communicate the Muscat regulations to the French and to tell them to made the necessary application to land at Gwadur. However, I now find that there is no print of the Bahrain regulations available for sending to the Minister; a print was made and copies sent to us in your printed letter P.Z.4121/34 of the 3rd August 1934, but it contained a misprint in Part II. I see that in his letter to Bertram P.Z.6845/34 of 7th November 1934 Laithwaite saidsaid xhat it was proposed to correct this error wnen the Muscat agreement was through, hut we do not appear to have received any copies of an amended print of the Bahrain regulations. 5. Perhaps you will let Malcolm know whether there is likely to he a corrected print available soon; if not, and it is decided to send Monsieur van Swinderen the regulations, we shall presumably have to have them typed out here. Alternatively, if the print was likely to he ready soon, we could forward the Muscat regulations and add that the Bahrain ones nad also been issued and would he communicated to him as soon as available in print (there is, of course, no question of communicating the Bahrain regulations to the French). In any case, it will apparently he necessary to leave sub-section (c) of Schedule II blank, as in the Muscat print; but Bertram explained in his letter to Rendel No. S.32956 of the 23rd July that there is no reason why this should hold up matters. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Bertram.i iiDiA oFnci, 1 -.Z.5051/ZS.

With regard to paragraph 2 of your letter «e see no objection to a copy of the Bahrein air navigation regulations being furnished to the Butch Minister at the same time as the Muscat regulations are sent to him* In case, however, he gains the impression from the Bahrein regulations that Dutch pilots centemplating, say occasional flights to India and beyonu, can readily obtain the permission of the Sheikh for flight over his territory it might be desirable to draw the attention of the Butch Minister to the present ban on the use of the Arabian Coast route by private aircraft whether British or foreign* On the question of the schedule of charges to be levied by Imperial Airways Btd* for attendance, etc. at the aerodromes we are still in discussion with the company as to the scale for commercial aircraft. $e do not think, however, that the communication of the regulations to the French and Dutch should be held up on this account as we are informed by Imperial Airways Ltd. that they have a special arrangement for all-in charges with the French (Air Union) and Butch (K.L.M.) companies who make use of Gwadur and that - the normal schedule of charges, when finally agreed, would only apply to other companies or commercial user© landing at Gwadur or the Arabian Coast Aerodromes. /As ft»«* Handel, ^q*, Foreign Office, * b * 1 . // / / 1 / As regariia paragraph 6 of your letter this is a matter oa which the foreign Office are more competent than the Air Ministry to ^udlge but it seems to us that it would be desirable to explain matters to the French in order to avoid giving offence• I tte* sending a copy of this letter to Dalton* Yours sincerely. K j &amp; — ——*r (E 3623/17/91) f. C FOREIGN OFFICE, „ ‘ &lt;1 r i 13th July, Dear Walton, Would you kindly refer to your letters Nos. P.Z. 3526/35 and P.Z 4132/35 of 6th June and 20th June respectively, about the question of informing the Dutch and French Governments of the regulations governing the passage of civil aircraft through Muscat territory? 2* When we were about to prepare the necessary drafts to the Dutch Minister in London and our Ambassador in Paris, we came across one or two points which, it seems to us, should be cleared up before any official action is taken in the matter. 3. In the first place, we are inclined to think, on reconsideration of the matter, that it will be desirable to communicate to the Dutch Minister/ J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.CMinister the civil air navigation regulations for Bahrein , as well as those for Muscat, You will remember that the question of communicating the Bahrein regulations to M. van Swinderen formed the subject of semi-official correspondence earlier in the year (ending with Laithwaite*s letter to * Johnstone, P,Z, 1258/35 of 26th February), as a result of which it was decided that there was no necessity at present to take any initiative in the matter. On the other hand when informing the Minister in our official note E 6461/11/91 of 13th November, 1933, that the Sultan of Bahrein had given his consent in principle to the regular use of Bahrein by Dutch aircraft, we did promise to communicate the technical and financial conditions on which foreign aviation companies might use Bahrein territory as soon as they were received from the Sheikh, It is true that the Dutch/Dutch Minister has not raised the matter since then, hut there seems to he no douht that if the K.L.M. should at any time, decide to make regular use of Bahrein (i.e. to transfer their route from the Persian to the Arabian side of the Gulf), both His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein are committed to granting the required permission. We should then in any case, have to communicate the relevant regulations to the Dutch Government, and as the regulations will have been in existence for a long time (they are a year old already) they might well consider that we had failed to implement the undertaking given to M. van Swinderen in our note of November, 1933, and feel that they had not been treated very courteously in the matter. Subject to your and Bertram’s views I suggest that the present occasion of our communicating the Muscat regulations provides a convenient opportunity for sending the Dutch Minister the Bahrein regulations as well. 4. Another/4. Another point which I think requires consideration before any of the air navigation regulations are communicated to foreign Governments is that of the second schedule of charges which it was decided should be attached to the various air navigation regulations to cover the fees for attendance and certain other services which would be performed by the staff of Imperial Airways, Limited, in their capacity of agents of His Majesty^ Government. You will remember that there was a lot of semi-official correspondence on this point in 1933/34, owing to the reluctance of Imperial Airways to produce a schedule of charges for services rendered to commercial ’’aircraft engaged in public transport” until they had completed their negotiations with the Dutch in connexion with the prolongation of the ajr route to Australia. It was finally decided that, while it was undesirable to press Imperial Airways to produce the necessary schedule of charges for the time being, it/it would be necessary for this scale of charges to be published (after approval by the Air Ministry) before any foreign commercial aircraft began to operate along the Arabian coast route. (please see in particular Bertram’s letters Nos. 260663/33/D.D.G.A. of 17th May, 1934 and S 32956/D.D.C.A. of 24th Ja nuary last to Laithwaite). consider that it will not be necessary to hold up the communication of the Muscat and Bahrein air navigation regulations or to wait any longer for Imperial Airways to produce their scale of charges, since the question of the use of Bahrein for foreign air transport companies is not immediate, and the question of these charges at Gwadur has presumably already solved itself since the Dutch and French aircraft have, I understand, been making periodical landings there for some time past. Moreover, I do not know what position has been reached in the negotiations between the Imperial Airways and 5. It may be that the/the K*L.M., which was the original cause of the publication of the charges being postponed, and the company may still be unwilling to commit themselves to any fixed scale. In any case, I should be glad to have your views on the point before any official action is taken vis-&amp;-vis the Dutch and French. 6. There is one further point which occurs to me In connexion with the communication of the Muscat regulations to the French. In your letter P.Z. 4132/35, of 20th June, you suggest that the French should be treated in the same way as the Dutch, and told to apply for a special authorisation to use Gwadur through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The French have however, in the past, negotiated on the subject direct with the Sultan, (see e.g. the translations of correspondence between the French Consul at Bushire and the Sultan in 1934, enclosed in Fowle’s express letter. No.C/159 of 15th May last), and it occurs to us that they may not like being told that they must now apply through Fowle, particularly in view of the jealousy with which/ l_. L 1which they guard their theoretical equality with us in Muscat. I think it will therefore he best to make it quite clear to the French, in amplification of the information which you suggested in paragraph 2 of your letter P.Z. 3526/35 of 6th June should he given them, that the obligation to apply through the Political Resident derives from the fact that the Sultan has agreed that all transactions and correspondence, whether by British or foreign companies or pilots, shall be conducted through the British political authorities. I am sending a similar letter to Bertram. 7.Tel. No.: WHITEHALL 7171. WHITEHALL, S. 52956 /C.A. 1 . xf/t ■ LONDON, S.W.1.

' 22nd January 1934, % Dear Bertram, I write with further reference to your letter of 27th September, No,248985/33/D.D.C.A,, about the schedule of agency charges to be made by Imperial Airways in respect of the use of aerodromes on the Arab Route by foreign commercial aircraft. You have had from time to time copies of the correspondence which has since the date of your letter passed on this point between us and the Foreign Office, 2 . I now write to say that in the light of the correspondence in question and on the understandings stated in paragraphs 1 &amp; 2 of Foreign Office letter of 12th January, No.E.7958/11/91, confirmation of which we should be glad to receive, we are prepared to agree not to press Imperial Airways to let us have immediately the charges they propose to make for public commercial transport aircraft at the Arabian Coast aerodromes, although it will be necessary to ask them to do so in advance oi any F.G.L.

LAITHWAITE* IFOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. (E 79 58/11/91) 12th January, 1934. My dear Laithwaite, With reference to your letter P.Z.7560/33 of the 27th December to me regarding the charges to be made by Imperial Airways along the Arab Coast air route, I write to say that, so far as the Foreign Office are concerned, we see no objection to the course which, I understand from Ken Johnstone, you propose, namely that we should refrain from pressing the Company to let us have their schedule of charges at once but should impress on them (a) that they will not be allowed to discriminate between one foreign company and another, and (b) that the fees will have to be published before the Dutch or any other foreign aircraft begin t o use the r oute. I take it, too, that His Majesty^ Government will require to approve the fees; that the Air Ministry would be kept at least generally in touch with any negotiations of a bargaining nature Imperial Airways may have on the subject with foreign aviation companies, and that they (the Air Ministry) would keep us informed as necessary. The special position of His Majesty’s Government in the matter of the Arab coast air route renders this necessary, I think. Our agreement to the course proposed is, of course, subject to any observations the Air Ministry may wish to offer on this correspondence. I am sending copies of this letter to Bertram and McClaughry. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Christopher Warner. J.G.Laithwaite, Esq.■P.z. 6191/33. IEDIA OFFICE, / * WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 20th October, 1933. My dear Warner, Would you kindly refer to my letter of 22nd August, No.P.Z.5180/33, to Bertram of the Air Ministry on the subject of the charges to be made by Imperial Airways in respect of Agency Services at the Arab Aerodromes in the Persian Gulf and Bertram’s reply of 27th September, ltfo.248985/33/D.D.C.A., enclosing a letter from Imperial Airways and enquiring whether it would not be possible in the circumstances discussed to postpone for the present a declaration of charges for public transport aircraft at the Arabian Coast aerodromes, of which a copy was sent by us to the Foreign Office at the time. I fear that owing to pressure of more urgent work we have so far taken no action on Bertram’s letter. I should now be grateful for your observations on the 1 point he raises. We are, of course, anxious, so far as is reasonably possible to assist Imperial Airways in matters such as the present, and we fully recognise that they might be in a better position to bargain with the Dutch if they were able to hold over the head of the latter the threat of retaliation at the Civil Aerodromes in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, the whole object, I think, of the policy we have adopted in dealing with the Civil Aerodromes on the Arab littoral has been to avoid precisely the type of difficulty which might arise in the event of Imperial Airways using the threat of increased charges at e.g. Bahrein or Koweit as a bargaining lever with foreign commercial canpanies in order to secure better terms for themselves in sane other section of their route to Australia. We aimed in these circumstances at securing/ C.F.A.Wahner, Esq.,— i wmt - securing that the local ruler would prescribe the terms on which foreign aircraft might use the aerodromes in his State and that Imperial Airways in charging foreign planes at a fixed rate for services rendered, would do so within the terns of the Sheikh's regulations and would recover charges from such planes at rates fixed by him and under his authority. I am rather inclined to think in these circumstances, subject to the views of the Foreign Office, that despite the disadvantage at which this may to some extent place Imperial Airways, it will be necessary to ask them to let us have at this stage (or at any rate in advance of any opening of the route to the Dutch or other foreign commercial aircraft) the charges they propose to make for public transport aircraft at the Arabian Coast Aerodromes. I should, however, be grateful for your observations in the light of which we might if necessary discuss the matter with Bertram, to whom and to McClaughry, I am sending a copy of this letter. (Sgd.)

There is a great deal in ?jhat he says and we view with some anxiety the arrangements that Imperial Airways will he able to make with the K.H.I.L.M. for use of the facilities in the Hetherland Indies provided for the use of the Hutch Company. In these circumstances it would undoubtedly be in the interests of Imperial Airways not to declare in advance the schedule of charges at the Arabian coast aerodromes. Ho you think that it will be possible to postpone for the present the declaration of charges for public transport aircraft at the Arabian coast aerodromes? Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

September,1933* Lear Bertram, I must apologise for the delay in replying to your letter of the 25th August, reference 260663/33/1.L.0.A., on the subject of the charges for agency facilities at Bahrein, Joweit and Gwadar. I see from Mr. Laithwaite T s letter that the India Office wish the schedules we prepare to cover aircraft engaged in public transport, but I am writing to tell you privately that we should prefer not to be committed to any scale of fees for public transport services, because of the position vuiicn may arise vis-a-vis the Lutch and ourselves, if we are successful on the Australia route, and a Company in which we are interested operates through the Netherland Indies. I hope that the luL.M.' or rather the K.U.I.L.M. will be reasonable in the charges they make for facilities in rhe Motherland Indies, but we ought to allow for the xact that they may be rather sore about the failure of their plan to get their service through to Australia, and they may assess their charges for assistance to the British aircraft on the Australian route at an unduly high scale. It is very important, from our point of view, that we should not give up in advance such bargaining power as we have. We hope it will be possible to come to an amicable arrangement with the Lutch whereby the facilities we provide for tnem can be set off against the facilities we hope they will provide for us in the Metherland Indies. But if the fees xor the Arabian Coast Aerodromes were settled and published now our position vis-a-vis the Lutch, and of course possibly the French would be weaker than if these fees were left for special negotiation with each public transport service as the necessity arises. Perhaps/Perhaps you can pass on a word about this to the India Office, so that only the schedule for privately owned aircraft need be settled and published at the present time* Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

I am therefore obliged to lay the following facts before you, and I am confident that the Government will help me in the matter which I am mentioning below and about which I have already informed you verbally* When you asked me to give a plot of land in my territory at Gwadur to be used as a landing ground for the aeroplanes of the Imperial Airways which call there weekly, I agreed and did not ask the Company to pay anything in lieu as then the financial position of my State was not so bad as it is at present* (fou are well aware and it is not necessary to give further explanation about it)* In view of this I request my friend the Government to help me in obtaining a certain amount annually from the said Company for the ground I gptve allowed them to use as a landing-ground tor their aeroplanes regularly every week* Purther I understand that the said Company are paying certain amounts as compensation for certain other grounds which are used by them* Undoubtedly the Government would not agree that I4' i tv 11 or w State should Incur any loss* I expect the Government to let me know their views on this subject* I shall be much obliged if you will forward this letter to my friend the Government*1. ^ f The general question of the arrangements to he made in connection with the leasing, etc. and upkeep of the aerodromes at Bahrein, Gwadur, Koweit, etc. has been discussed with the Air Mnistry and with Colonel Powle in the light of the telegrams below, and comprehensive proposals are under consideration. 2. The proposals in question will cover the question of the financial arrangements to be made between the local rulers and Imperial Airways or H.M.G, and also that of the conditions, financial and other, subject to which foreign companies may be allowed to use the facilities available at the aerodromes concerned.INiP'EXEJD In any further communication on this subject, please quote N °- r and address —to any person by name, but to- a P 7 “ J he Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, • THE Under-Secretary oi^sla^r fir compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop (Co of the under-mentioned paper F &gt;reign Affairs presents hi&amp;3 O 3 - ~~—-W Foreign Office, -\n£t (** , 193J .

These being under the control of ruler and the latter being susceptible to our influence, some measure of control vis-a-vis foreign aircraft in emergency would still remain with His Majesty’s Government. Ho question of lease would arise but all aeroplanes would pay landing fee.

Now that the Dutch have returned to the charge and press their request ior facilities for Netherlands aircraft along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf we must, I think, agree with the Foreign Office that facilities (within the limits approved after interdepartmental aiscussion last autumn ana subsequently accepted by the Dutch Government - see P.Z.5881/32 flagged) cannot well be refused. The Foreign Office suggest that an application on their behalf should be made to the i i Sheikh of Bahrein only, their assumption being that the earlier Dutch application for permission to fly over Gwadur, to which reference is made in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter, would cover the use of Gwadur for the present purpose. But Colonel Fowlers despatch of 16th February No.151-3, on , of Muscat P.Z.1459/33, makes it clear that the Sultan/requires a formal application to be made in respect of any regular use of Gwadur and the draft telegram submitted is worded accordingly. c». f A*'— A-fW- - v ^ ( t-n-.aj. ^ a. urt. ^ ^ 'J*j£tkzjjsX /r.irtA-33 P- Ta 1212 5000 9.32Action on this question was postponed as the result of iniorrral discussion with the Foreign Office consequent on the receipt of the Air Ministry letter of loth larch.

It now appears that they referred only to services of mechanics, oil, fuel, petrol, etc., and the making of a contribution to overhead charges by ; foreign aircraft using aerodromes maintained by them, fhe matter was discussed at an interdepartmental conference at the Air Ministry on 3rd April, when it was agreed that, an immediate reference should be made to the Resident on the general lines of the telegram now attached, and that the Foreign Office should simultaneously prepare an interim reply to the hutch to the effect that the necessary communication haa been made to the Gulf rulers; that in the event of uiiose rulers granting the necessary permission some \ arrangement would, however, be necessary between the K.L.M. and Imperial Airways in respect of facilities at landing grounds maintained by Imperial Airways unaer agreement with the rulers concerned, and that uiose. rulers were understooa to be contemplating the imposition of landing fees on aircraft using their landing grounds. a i S-iv.33FoZe1854/33, (b^CC^I- k+rr Cypher tetlegraa; from Qsoretary of State to Govenfinent of India* Foreign and Political Department, Dated 6.4.33.

I now give permission to the Dutch areoplanes to fly over and land at my territory Gwadur in case of emergency only and not regularly. If the Dutch aero planes wish to fly and land weekly they must apply for a further permission from me.

SX0- With reference to Foreign Office letter No. E 6451/98/91 of the 29th December, 1932, regarding the question of the possible grant of facilities for Netherlands aircraft along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying COpy of a note from the Netherlands Minister, from which it will be seen that the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company still desire to obtaihffaeilitiee in question. 2. In view of the repetition of this request, Sir John Simon considers that, subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, an application on behalf of the Netherlands Government should now be made to the Sheikh of Bahrein in accordance with the offer made in paragraph 8 of the note of the 31st August to the Netherlands Minister, a copy of which was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter ^ the 2nd September* 3. Sir John Simon further suggests that an endeavour should he made to expedite the reply of the Sultan of Muscat to the application regarding the regularisation of the use of Gwadur by Netherlands aircraft which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed in the telegram, a copy of which was enclosed in India Office letter No* P,Z* 6962/32 of the 23rd December, to make on behalf of the Netherlands Government to His Highness* The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.

Please see Mr. Laithwaite’s minute on P.Z.6962/32. The draft reply to the Netherlands Minister, which is enclosed with the F.O.letter, closely follows the line taken in our letter to the F.O. (P.Z.6962/32). It starts with a reference to the steps being taken to regularise the position at Gwadur (F@Z 4 &amp;£&gt; 2 ), and goes on to enquire whether the Dutch wish any longer to pursue their request for facilities on the Arab Coast route in view of the renewed permission which they have obtained to fly along the Persian Coast of the Gulf. The position at Yas and Koweit is then dealt with. I understand from the A.M. that in fact Imperial Airways do not at present fly in a direct line from Bahrein to Shargah but are accustomed to make a loop in the direction of Yas Island, so as to keep within fairly easy reach of the coast at any rate during the present experimental stage of the Arab Coast route. In view of this the Air Ministry are proposing an amendment to para. 3 of the draft, so as to make the second sentence read-aasre 1 or logo as follows:- H The aerodrome-at-Yas—which is no more than an emergency landing ground on-(£«jnilitary air route (U^for ^4-vil^nPreris not used by Imperial Airways This is a point for the Air Ministry to raise and it is submitted that we may concur in the draft subject to their views.

It will te remembered th^t consequent on the opening of the British civil air route along the Arab Coast, of the Persian Gulf requests were received from the French and Dutch Governments for corresponding facilities for their own aircraft. After considerable discussion it was decided that it would be impossible to refuse such requests, but that we should confine the grant of facilities, at any rate at the present stage, to Bahrein and Gwadur; that with regard to the intermediate stage we should state that numerous difficulties haa still to be overcome ana that it woula not be possible to state what facilities, if |any, coula be afforded until the question had been, more thoroughly examined ana the new route put to the test of practical experience (in other words, that we would not agree to trie use of our station at Shargah); and that in general we should require a formal undertaking from the foreign Governments concerned that every effort would be made by their civil aircrait to keep exactly to an agreed route and to comply strictly with any advice they might receive from British officials in the Persian Gulf area. 2* The French have now expressed appreciation of our attitude, but havejintMated that they propose to continue to fly along the Persian side of the Gulf, although they had “been unable to secure the renewal of the Persian Government's pemission for any definite period and were thus obliged to apply for their 'sanction for each separate flight.' (c.f. on this the previous submission on P.2.5627/32 flagged below). This is satisfactory from our point of view. It keeps the South Persian air route open and at the same time reduces/ 4000 3/32... ]V reduces tdie extent to which foreigners ure operating the Arad Goast route. 3 . The Dutch have given the assurances for which we ashed (see their note of 24th September on P.Z. 5881 / 32 ), hut, not content with this, now enquire whether we should he prepared to allow them to use our aerodromes at Koweit and at Yas Island. Koweit is, of course, more or less on the line of the civil air route, hut is not at present a regular Imperial Airways station, although, at the request of the Sheikh, Airways have agreed to call from time to time to meet his convenience. Yas Island is on the strategic-air route, well south of the main civil air route and in an area from v\hich we are anxious to exclude foreigners so far as possible. 4 . The views of the Air Ministry will he found in their letter of the 7th November on P.Z.6824/32. We may entirely agree with them that facilities cannot he considered at Yas Island. To grant those facilities would stultify the reservations made by u; in agreeing to the use of our civil air facilities by the Dutch. The position as regards Koweit is rather more difficult, because of the fact that it is to a MSU slight extent already used by Imperial Airways, as explained above. ■ The Air Ministry, as will be seen!, are by no means anxious that facilities should be l f,- {t-i , V- * given at it, and in general, while our policy of exclusion , will no aouot have to be modified as time goes on, we are anxious to keep foreigners out of these States i | so far as possible, and the position is complicated in] the case of Koweit, as the Air Ministry point out, by | the risk of tribal raids and the impossibility of guaranteeing that the aerodrome would always be available.

' x t itfo.E.4359/3307/65. S.W.l. 31st August, 1932. Sir, In your notes Nos.889 of the 17th June and 957 of the 5th July you were so good as to put forward certain proposals for the improvement of civil aviation facilities on the Eastern air route, and to enquire as to the facilities which might eventually be made available for Netherlands flying services on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. 2. In reply, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom fully appreciate the desirability of co-operation between those Governments which are interested in the development of civil aviation, and, more particularly, in the operation of a civil air route to India and the Ear East. Any proposals having as their object the improvement of conditions on this route, by means of the joint endeavours of the Governments primarily concerned, will always receive their sympathetic consideration. 3. His Majesty’s Government have thus received and considered with the greatest sympathy the present suggestion of the Netherlands Government for joint representations to the Governments of certain oriental countries situated on the Eastern air route, such as Iraq and Persia, involving a proposal that the cost of satisfactory ground equipment at the necessary aerodromes might be borne, in whole or in part, by the Governments of the Netherlands, of France, and of the United Kingdom. 4. They agree that representations on these lines might well, in certain circumstances, have a useful effect, especially/ Jonlcheer H.de Marees van Swinderen, G.C.V.O. , etc. , etc. , etc.Iespecially if all other methods of persuading a Government to provide the necessary facilities were to prove unavailing. In practice, however, His Majesty’s Government are not convinced that circumstances render it desirable to approach either the Persian Government or the Iraqi Government on these lines for the present. 5. So far as Persia is concerned, the existing facilities at Bushire and Jask do not appear to be inadequate. In any case, however, it would not be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to join in the proposed representations to the Persian Government at present, in view of the decision, referred to in your note of July 5th, that Imperial Airways machines shall follow a route along the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf after October 1st next, the date on which their present permit fran the Persian Government expires. His Majesty’s Government have therefore no immediate interest in the upkeep of suitable facilities for a commercial air service in Persian aerodromes. 6 . As regards Iraq, very considerable facilities for civil air services already exist, and where, as at Basra, such facilities are not yet entirely satisfactory, the Iraqi Government, who have shown themselves actively interested in civil aviation, are themselves engaged in an endeavour to improve them. 7. In brief, therefore, the views of His Majesty’s Government are that where, as in Persia, reasonably adequate facilities for a civil air service are already provided, or where, as in Iraq, the territorial government is itself actively engaged in an attempt to improve the existing facilities, it is unnecessary for the governments of the operating companies to institute joint representations/representations in the sense proposed hy the Netherlands Government. At the same time, if all other methods failed, His Majesty’s Government might in principle he prepared to join in such representations in any cases where they should appear essential at a later stage. S. As regards the intention to establish an air route along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf on October 1st next, I have the honour to explain that the necessary arrangements are not yet complete. It is therefore difficult to state what facilities it will eventually be possible to offer to the aircraft of the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company (K.L.M.). I have little doubt that the Governments of Muscat and Bahrein would be willing, if approached, to grant the Company’s aircraft facilities at Gwadur and Bahrein similar to those which will be enjoyed by Imperial Airways Limited, and I shall be happy to forward by telegraph to these Governments an official application on behalf of the Netherlands Government for the necessary permission, on learning that you desire me to do so. In view, however, of the exceptional local conditions existing in this area and of the special treaty relations existing between these Arab States and His Majesty’s Government, I should be glad to receive at the same time a formal assurance that in the event of the necessary permission being granted by the Governments of Muscat and Bahrein respectively, the Dutch air service would make every effort to keep exactly to an agreed route, and would comply strictly with any advice \ which they might receive from the British officials in the Persian Gulf area, who alone are in a position to foresee local difficulties, and, by guarding against them, to secure the maximum degree of smooth working for the air 9./ID 9. With regard to the intermediate stage between Bahrein and Gwadur, numerous difficulties have yet to be overcome, and it will not be possible to state what facilities, if any, can be afforded to the Royal Butch service until the question has been more thoroughly examined and the new route put to the test of practical experience.

Sir, In continuation of my telegram Bo.472, of today’s date, 1 have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a xer&amp;r.er dated 23rd July 1932, from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat asking that His Majesv*. Government, on his behalf, may request the French and Butch Governgu?.*^ seek his formal permission for their aircraft to fly over Gwadur territory and land thereon when necessary. I recommerd that action may be taken in accordance with His Highness’ request. 2. Though His Highness* letter is intended to refer only to regular air services and not to occasional foreign craft the permission to be obtained by the French and Butch Governments will cover the passage of occasional aircraft of these two nations. As regards occasional foreign air craft of other nationality as His Highness has not raised the question of their passage over his territory and there is • •.. •—is no likelihood of any obstruction being offered to them l suggest that this question need not be raised at present* Ter bally in the first instance* he was much exercised on the subject. On his way from Muscat he had called at Qwadur where his /all igovernor} had informed him that J*rench and Dutch aeroplanes landed at Owadur. His Highness pointed out that while the Imperial Airways had permission to land in his territory, the French and the Dutch Govern ment s had never applied for permission, which they ought to have done, and that he (His Highness) had instructed his Mil *not to permit* their aeroplanes to land* I made due allowances for His Highness* attitude* he is young and the Kuler of a small State, both of which circumstances tend towards hyper-sensitIrenesa, but pointed out that the air-lines concerned had used the Gwfcdur route for some years now, without any objection from the Muscat State, and that the omission on the part of the Governments concerned to apply for formal permission could be rectified if he would let me have a request to that effect* His Highness saw the point of these arguments, he is very reasonable when a matter is explained to him carefully, and at my suggestion sent a telegram to the Wali of Gwadur directing him not to interfere with any foreign aircraft that might land* fhia removed the risk of any unpleasant ’inter national incidents* pending a re gu lari sat i on of the matter.

In particular, it is concerned with Britain's policy over restricting access to this route to non-British aircraft. It contains applications from the Governments of France, Italy, and the Netherlands for permission for their companies to access this route. These companies being: Air France, Ala Littoria, and Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM) respectively. The focus of these applications is on obtaining access to landing grounds at Gwadur, Kuwait, Bahrain (Muharraq), Sharjah, and Yas Island. The file contains a record of the British response to these applications, which is largely correspondence between officials over the extent that they can legitimately exclude these companies from the region; there is particular concern over keeping Sharjah aerodrome an exclusively British preserve.As a result of a policy decision made by the British Government to allow Air France and KLM access to Muharraq and Gwadur (for refuelling and in cases of emergency), the file includes periodic applications from these companies to the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Sultan of Muscat for authorisation to use these aerodromes.The correspondence dating from the Second World War (1939-1945) largely relates to a reversal of British policy – due to wartime difficulties – which allowed KLM to run regular air services via Bahrain and Sharjah for the duration of the war. It also contains discussion related to an attempt to secure a wartime agreement to facilitate the utilisation of KLM aircraft for war purposes by the British.The correspondence with the Government of France and with Air France is in French, as is a small proportion of the correspondence with the Government of the Netherlands. Overall, the French language content forms only a small proportion of the material within the file.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Bahrain, and the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat. There is also correspondence with officials of the following British Government departments: the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India (External Affairs Department from 1937). Correspondence is frequently forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Gwadur Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, airline</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muharraq Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
