I think the idea of such visits by aircraft in every way excellent. 3. .A firing area near Sharjah could easily be arranged without danger to the local popula tion. 4. It may seem an unnecessary precaution, but it might be as well to warn the Squadron Commander of the large numbers of rifles in Truclal Oman and of the consequent slight possibility that 'Sporting' bedouin might fire at low flying aircraft. I think that extremely flying over bedouin should be avoided| although this might be carried out over the towns without danger# Yours sincerely, 0 His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI., Political Resident, Persian Giilf, Bahrain .P.p.

With a view to ensure that the object of the deaonstration was not entirely misinterpreted by local Shai]chs y A.s.L.O requested Agency Clerk| Sharjah. to m^ke arrangements for calls to be made on both the Shaikhs or Sharjah and Dubai, Accordingly in the evening of the first demonstration, 10 officers of 84 Squadron A.l.O., Habbaniya and A.s.l.O ., Bahrain, accompanied by the Agency clerk called first on Shaikh Mohammed bin Saqr of Sharjah and later on Shaikh Said bin Maktum of Dubai t and were afforded a very friendly recaption* A.S.L.O informed both Shaikhs of the areas over which the aircraft had flown during the course of the morning 9 and mentioned that the same areas would be covered again on the following day. Both Shaikhs expressed their surprise over the speed and consider* able ground covered by the aircraft, and were both invited to take part in the following d&amp;y's flight. Shaikh Mohammed bin Saqr tactfully declined whilst Shaikh Said bin Mahttaa appeared to be under the impression that the real object cf the flight would be to remove him temporarily from Dubai, Both Shaikhs, howver, agreed to inspect the eircraft on the ground on the following day. It was also noted that Shaikh Said bin Mahtum was surrounded by an unusually large retinue of well armed followers who kept close watches on both entrances of the reception room in which the interview took place. The following day, the l£th of June, the same flight was again carried out with the exception that the leg between Sabkhat Uatti and Jebel Odaid was eliminated in preference for deeper penetration into the Liwa area. Agein on this second sortie no incidents were recorded and no oil camps or convoys of vehicles could be located* Shortly after the aircraft returned, both Shaikhs called at the Officers* mess Sharjah. arriving there almost simultaneously. After the usual refreshments were served, the Shaikhs and their followers were taken to the airfield to inspect the Brigenda, A.S.L.O informed the Shaikhs that large numbers of such aircraft were available at Habbaniya and could be sent to the Trucial Coast at a moment's notice should the need arise. After the Shaikhs had inspected the inside of the aircraft, details of the Brigands 1 cannon fire power and bomb load were given and was followed by a detailed description of the power of destruction of rockets in relation to typical local buildings. The visit ended by pictures of the gathering being taken and Shaikh Said bin Hakttm asking the officers to have dinner with him on the following night. Unfortunately the invitation had to be canmelled later in the evening as the Brigands were recalled to Habbaniyi ahead of schmdttle. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited representatives and Imperial Bank of Iran Manager(Dubai) have been asked to collate for transmission to A.S.L.# reports from towns and the interior of reaction to the demonstration. Unfortunately, to date these reports have not yet been received by this office. ( SOD ). G.E. LB*18.
