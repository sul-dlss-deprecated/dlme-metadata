THE claims of the Imperial Tobacco Corpora tion of Persia have been settled, and the original Concession and the title-deeds of their estate have been handed over to the Persian Govern ment. Both parties are satisfied. M. Bostelman having submitted to the Persian Government a scheme founded on an old but lapsed Concession held by M. Poliakoff, the Shah has granted to the t£ Oompagnie pour 1 Assuiance et le Transport en Perse,” a Russian Company, a Concession for the construction ol a road from Enzeli to Kazvin, which is already connected with Tehran by a road. The Company is to form a Perso-Bussian Association which is to receive the support of the bhah. »he sui^e^s are to begin within one month, the construe tion within a further six months, and the road is to he completed within a further eighteen months. The Company is to have the right of priority for any railroad, tramway, or “ chaussee ” which the Persian Government may desire to ha\ e con structed between Tehran, Kazvin, and the Caspian. Failing such priority the Company is to be reimbursed its outlay at a rate gh ing it a profit of 5 per cent. The greater part of the capital is to he * Extracted from Eastern Department Memorandum of October 15, 1893 (Confidential Taper No. 6404).subscribed by Persians, but M. Poliakoff, who is a Russian, will keep the management in bis own hands. The Concession also promises to the Company Enzeli Lagoon, a further Concession for cleaning out and deepening the lagoon at Enzeli. Afghanistan and, Persia. A year ago, at the request of the Shah, and in Afghanistan and persecution of Shiahs conformity with our Treaty obligations to Persia, Sir F. Laacelles, we made representations to the Ameer with regard her 21, 1892. to his persecution of the Shiahs, which had led India Office, to a large immigration of them into Persian 23, 183 ' 5 ' territory, where the sympathies of the population were likely to create such a state of things as to be a danger to peaceable relations between Persia and Afghanistan. The Ameer denied having interfered with subjects of the Shah, and claimed the right to punish his own rebellious Shiahs, who, he asserted, were prompted by Meshed priests at the instigation of Russia.

The Russian Chargd d’Affaires thereupon summoned a small body of Russian troops, who occupied the town tempo rarily without meeting with more than a show of opposition from the Persian frontier guards. At A ezd the Parsees have been so ill-treated Yezd and Bakhtiari country. that 500 of them have left for Bombay, and all power is in the hands of the Lutis. The Bakhtiari country has been in revolt against oppression and exactions. At Shiraz the telegraph office was last May occupied by a large crowd, who demanded a reduction in the price of bread, a regulation of exchange, and protection against the Arab tribes. Sir F.

The movement was said to be instigated by the former Governor of Shiraz, wiio had been dis missed, and the Mollahs. The mob, on receiving reassuring promises from the Governor, demanded that the Kavam-ul-Mulk—an enemy of the Mol- lahs—should be removed from the Mayoralty. The Shah yielded to this demand. They thenSir F. Lascellee, No. 35, Tele graphic, May 20, Hiots at Hamadan. Sir F.

The Shah thereupon directed the telegraph office to he cleared hy force, and troops, supported hy Arab and Baharloo tribes, tv ere ordered to disperse the mob. The troops fraternized with the mob, and lired on their own supports. The Shah then yielded to all the demands of the mob, and ordered the Kavam-ul- Mulk to be sent to Tehran. There were riots at Hamadan, instigated by Mollah Abdullah, and directed against the Jews. Sir F. Lascelles, No. 173, Tele graphic, December 14; 1892. Sir F. bascules.

The Mollah was summoned to Tehran, but was stopped and brought hack in triumph hy the people, and the Governor fled. The Shah con templated sending troops to Hamadan, hut the success of such an expedition was doubtful, and the Shah accepted a compromise, under which the Mollah left Hamadan,, and the Governor returned thither. The Persian Government has promised to see that the Jews are not ill-treated, but in their own interest they will have to continue to wear a distinctive dress, which is one of their grievances. General Condition of Persia. Turkey and Persia Boundary questions. Sir Clare Ford, No. 376, Decem ber ID, 1892. State of Persia, and feeling with regard to Shah. Sir F. Lascelles, No. 166, Novem ber 9 ; and No. 167, Very Confdential, November 9, 1892. There have been differences between Persia and Turkey in regard to the occupation of places the right to which is in dispute between the two countries, as they have not carried out in detail the general direction as to the frontier which was laid down by the British and Russian Commis sioners. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs believes that the national existence of Persia is solely dependent on the life of the present Shah, and the Porte fears the probably consequent intervention of Russia on the plea of re-estab lishing order, which would bring her in further contiguity with the Turkish frontier. The Province of Ears, and particularly the town of Shiraz, has been in a very disturbed state. The Amiu-es-Sultan attributes the state of affairs there and in other parts of Persia to the intrigues of two of the Shah’s sons: the [773] CZil-es-Sultan, who was disappointed at his uncle the Rukn-ud-Dowleh, and not himself, being appointed Governor, and the Naib-us-Sultaneh, the War Minister. These two Royal persons had, the Amin believed, come to the conclusion that the present reign was drawing to a close. They therefore wished to keep the country in a disturbed state, each hoping that in the confusion which would follow on the Shah’s death he would be able to seize the supreme power. The Zil-es- Sultan trusted to his authority in the south, and the Naib-es-Sultan eh to his popularity with the army. The Amin regards these calcu lations as ill-founded. Last autumn Sir F. Lascelles endeavoured to ^\£ a * ce,,e *» No. 168, secret ascertain what foundation existed for the dis- and Confidential, quieting rumours which had for some time past November 9, 1892 been circulated with regard to the discontent of the people, the hatred of the foreigner, and the probability of a movement taking place directed against the Shall himself. The Kavam-ud-Lowleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that the condition of affairs could not be worse. There was no administration, no justice, and no security. He himself was Minister for Foreign Affairs only in name, and was not allowed even to know what was being done. Any one in the country who had property could not be sure that he would not be deprived of it upon some frivolous pretext. The Shah had been warned over and over again of the danger which such a situation caused to Persia, but would listen to no one. There was absolutely no ill-feeling against the foreigner, but there was a very strong feeling, which was not confined to the poorer classes, against the Government and the Shah himself. He did not anticipate any disturbances, but unless some change took place before long the situation would become hopeless. The Amin-ud-Dowleh, Minister of Posts, used very similar language as regards the administra tion of justice. The laws, he said, were excellent, • but were not executed. His Excellency also stated there was no ill-feeling against the foreigner, and no danger of disturbances unless there were a scarcitv of food. The conversations which Sir F. Lascelles had with other Ministers, more especially with the Mushir-ud-Dowlch (Mohsin Khan) and the Moukbar-ud-Howleh, the Minister of Telegraphs,ft* 5 General Gordon, December 3, 1892. were much to the same effect. They all blamed the Shah, who seems to have lost much of his energy, and to have become even more avaricious than formerly. The Moukbar-ud-Dowleh stated that the State Treasury was empty, and that the Shah had been obliged to have recourse to his private treasury for the absolute necessities of the Government. This, however, was only a temporary relief, as His Majesty, on the rare occasions on which he can be induced to disburse monev, is in the habit of taking a bond from the State Treasury, which he insists upon being paid as soon as sufficient monev comes in. * The criticisms on the Shah are not confined to the upper classes, and it is a common thing to hear His Majesty openly abused by all classes of the population. The only exception is the Imam Juma, who, being appointed by the Government, may be considered as the official head of the priesthood. He at first denied that there was any discontent among the people; he admitted that the situation was abnormal, but maintained that this was due to the intrigues of the leaders, who were jealous of each other, and that if they would settle their disputes among themselves matters would at once resume theii normal state. He admitted also that the ^liah was getting old, and had perhaps lost some of his energy, but he denied that he was unpopular among the people. The Amin-es-Sultan frequently complains of the Shah, who he says has lost his energy, and whose avarice has reached such a point as to amount to madness, and he states that he has seriously warned His Majesty of the gravity of the situation, and of his inability to render him effective assistance unless His Majesty will consent to take energetic action. With regard to the feeling against foreigners. Sir F. Lascelles is inclined to think that it has been grossly exaggerated. The Mulk Ava, a brother of the Shah, who during his father’s lifetime occupied a position of great authority, and at the beginning of the present reign was taken under British protection, and resided for several years in exile, described the present situation of Persia as resembling a lump of sugar in a glass of water which was gradually melting away. General Gordon says that at present theMollahs are ike only popular leaders of the revo- lutionarv movement. They have taken advan tage of the discontent to seize temporal power, and they seem to be in a fair way to work the country into such a state as to drive the Shah to seek Russian protection, or to make the people themselves do so on the Shah’s death. Sir I\ Lascellcs had an audience of the Shah on the 17th December, 1892. His Majesty denied that the Mollahs had any power in political matters. They were not responsible, he said, for the disturbances at Hamadan and Shiraz. Certain Notables objected to the new Governors, and got up disturbances to discredit them. Sir T\ Lascelies regards the Shah as quite indifferent to what takes place in Persia. There was a Ministerial crisis in Persia in January, hut it ended in the return to favour of the Amin-es-Sultan, who became Sadr Azam. Before this consummation, however, the Amin poured forth to Sir F. Lascelles and Mr. Churchill accounts of his woes and grievances, and the miserable state of the country, which he said would soon come'under a Russian Protectorate either on appeal from the people against the Shah’s misgovernment, or at the instance of the Shah himself. The Amin-es-Sultan informed Sir F. Lasceiles that during the crisis he had received frequent offers of support from the' Russian Minister, which he had refused. Shah on state of Persia, Sir F.

Persian Crown succession. Lieutenant-General J. E. Gordon, who was Military At ramie at Tehran, visited the Heir Apparent to the Persian Throne, the Vali-Ahd, at Tabreez, at the end of last year. He found him to he of a mild and timid disposition, and in complete dependence on the Russian Consul- General. Azerbaijan furnishes the best portion of the artillery and infantry of the Persian army. The Turks of that province are excellent soldiers, and may he regarded as attached to the Yali-Abd. In the event of the Shah’s death the Shuju-es- Sultaneh would probably be able, with his Turk regiments and the Amin-es-Sultan’s assistance, to hold the Palace and guard the treasure until the arrival of the Vali-Ahd with his troops from Tabreez.

Morier was instructed to sound the Russian Government as to whether they would be ready to entertain the idea of concerted action with England in the event of a demise of the Persian Crown, on the basis of the understanding of 1831 between England and Russia, which had been renewed in 1888, # for the maintenance of the independence and integrity of Persia. For that object the two Powers to agree to come to an understanding now to do all they can on the death of the Shah to secure the peaceable succession of the Vali-Ahd. M. Chichkine informed Sir R. Morier that nothing had happened to change the views of the Russian Government since the last exchange of ideas, and that it was most certainly their intention, in the event contemplated, to support the Vali-Ahd. Sir R. Morier was instructed to take an oppor tunity, on his return to St. Petersburg}!, of sounding M. Chichkine as to an exchange of notes on the subject. This was to be insinuated rather than be made a point of, as the Vali-Ahd’s state of health was such as to make it not unlikely that he might predecease his father. Sir R. Morier returned to St. Petersburg}! on the 30th May, and left again on the 3rd July. He did not report having done anything under these instructions. Russia and Persia, Russia and Persia have concluded a Treaty (27th May, o.s.) by which the latter cedes to the former Eiruzoh, in Khorassan, in exchange for Hissar and a strip of land on the right bank of the River Aras, near Abhasabad, in Azerbaijan. The Treaty also provides for a&gt; rectification of frontier from Baba Durmaz towards the Heri Rud, and for its demarcation by Boundary Com missioners. By a subsequent exchange of notes the Secret Convention of 1881 between Russia and Persia, which provided for the passage of Russian troops through Persia, and provisioning them in time of war, was annulled; Russia admitted the right of Persia to establish an Agent at Askabad, and agreed to make Russian subjects * See Memorandum of August 6, 1892, pp. 12, 13.liable to trade corporation taxes in Persia if other foreign subjects were made equally liable.
