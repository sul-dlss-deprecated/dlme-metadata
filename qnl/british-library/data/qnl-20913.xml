It recognises the right of Britain to undertake in future as in the past the lighting, buoying and policing of the Gulf. France as well as Germany have been kept well-informed of the negotiations which are not likely to end without a definite agreement maintaining British rights and privil eges with reference to the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates. This is likely to include the establicl'iinent of an Ottoman commission with strong British par'icipation/ to exercise independently the functionf of a navigation and port authority over the Shatt-al-Arab. This can only be effective if the heads of both the inspection and the engineer branches are British. The whole agreement when completed and confirmed will be an event of utmost import ance for the promotion of British commercial interest in the middle east./ ! i No. 1704-E.A., (Confidential) dated Simla, the 31st July 1913. 1 From L.

From-LiEUTENANT -COLONEL Sir Percy Cox, K.C .I. E., C .S .T., Poli'ical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Departmenti Simla. I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department Telegram No. 140-8., dated 29th May, asking my views as to the steps which can best be taken in order to enable us to obtain full advantage from the new position which we are acquiring in relation to the Katar Peninsula under the Anglo-Turkish Convention now on the point of conclusion. 2. At the moment, the subject is rendered a little complicated by an independent development, namely, the expulsion of the Turks from Hasa and Katif and the assumption of the control of that province by Bin Saud. Mean while the Porte shows no sign of removing their garrison from A1 Bidaa, and indeed I doubt whether Shaikh Jasim would readily part with it at present, for in the absence of the Turkish garrison or of assurances from us to supply the place of it, he would not unnaturally feel somewhat apprehensive of being absorbed ty Bin Saud. For this reason I am inclined to think that another meeting with him at an early date is advisable either on the part of the Political Agent, Bahrain, or myself., for the purpose of explaining to him the gist of the Anglo-Turkish Con vention so far as it concerns Katar and Bahrain, and in order to see vhat we are likely to get him to accept in the direction of closer relations with us. The inability to give him any reply on the subject of the Arms Traffic Subsidy will be a little inconvenient, but I think it will be possible to make him understand that this matter is connected with our current negotiations with the French Government and that the consideration of it necessarily takes a long time. It seems possible that the said negotiations with France may have advanced somewhat in the last few weeks and that the horizon may be clearer for a con sideration of the Katar question ; in any case, presuming that the Convention with Turkey admits of it, it will probably be necessary to give Shaikh Jasim a subsidy in some form. 3. As soon as the ground is sufficiently prepared, I am of opinion that we should make a treaty with Shaikh Jasim by which we should recognise his autonomy, give him assurances of protection, (so long as he observes his obliga tions to us) from attack by sea, and good offices to prevent unprovoked attack by land (by Bin Saud for instance) and should in return require from him under takings under the following heads, so far as proves possible. (i) To receive an Agent of the British Government of India at A1 Bidaa; (for the present a Mohammedan Agent of the type of the Resi- 'dency Agent at Lingah, working immediately under the Political Agent at Bahrain). (ii) To allow British Indians to reside in the Katar ports for trade, and to afford protection for their lives and properties. (iii) Not to levy duty at more than 5 per cent ad valorem, (iv) To render co-operation generally for the oreservation of the Maritime Truce, and in particular for the suppression of the Slave Trade, Piracy and the Arms Traffic. (v) To issue a prohibition against the import or sale of Arms and Ammunition in Katar territory except under special license. (vi) To undertake not to allow foreigners including British subjects, to acquire monopolies or concessions ; or to acquire pearling rights or use diving dresses in his waters, without the cognizance and approval of the British Government.i • A^^nf of anv Power other than Great Britain (and (Vii) ^Tu^JTand^ot to correspond with the officials ^ any orter Power without the cognizance and concurrence of the Bnt.sh Authorities. % . • t n (viii) ^tionta's aT^wak 1 an^'efhS Sev« the'Sh Govern- ment consider that the step is needed. desi^^t;tt S Sn^x^^£^^e^€ terms ot 'theConvent^m w^th^Tudcey^ but this is a point .or the consideration of higher authority.

When the new Turkish detachment arrived a short time ago# Sheikh Jasim was pleased# presumably hoping that it meant a postponement of the evil day. 4. There is no doubt that Sheikh Jasim clings firmly to the Turkish detachment since Bin Saud became active# and he will not part with it if he can help it# unless he gets some assur ance from us. All reports seem to show that he dislikes and fears Bin Saud.^X nay add that our Infornant# who probably went to Katar to buy arniy also report# that the people hare bought up a nunber of arms and are keeping then, as it seeraa that the sup ply of arm® for eale has run short* e In oonoluslon I would obserre that I aw ready at any tine to go oyer and see Sheikh Jasira about the natter&gt; but as I have not yst had an opportunity of making his aoquaintanoe, I expect that a visit from you, if you have time, would be nruoh more effective if anything is to be arranged* I have the honour to be.

Hia Majesty's Consul, Basrah, has been asked by Foreign Office to state whether the troops that were sent to Qatar are in relief or in addition to those already there. I am asking Political Agent to make sure, but in any case my inclination is to connect this movement with the apprehensions of Shaikh Jasim in regard to Bin Saud's intentions, vide my letter No.1963 dated June 22nd (para 2). Would it not now be possible for me to inform Shaikh Jasim by letter of the general trend of that portion of the Anglo-Turkish Convention which refers to Qatar, and of the fact that his autonomy is duly recognised therein. From the Political Agent, Bahrein's report it seems probable both that Shaikh Jasim will not part with the detachment of Turkish troops -unless we give him an assurance that we will protect him from molestation by Bin Saud; and also that failing such an assurance from us in regard to his auto nomy he probably fears that he will be absorbed by us on withdrawal of Turkish troops.

In amplification of my telegram No. 8r 2, dated 21st July 1914 to your address I have the honour to forward herewith the promised draft agreement and notification which 1 propose when duly authorised by Government to do so, to endeavour to obtain from Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani. 'I he draft has been prepared from the material at my disposal in Sir Percy Cox's despatch to the Government of India dated 22nd June 1913 on this subject and Government of India telegram dated nth September 1913 to the Marquess of Crewe together with the considerable light, thrown on the altitude and intentions of the A1 Thani family by Sir Percy Cox's earlier despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 755» dated 2nd March 19'3. 2. It appears to me to be a matter for ronsiderarion on the spot whether the Treaty should be made with the natural head of the family only, Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani or whether the other sons of old Shaikh Jasim should sign also. It would no doubt be preferable to deal with one man, if only to pre vent family squabbles in regard to the distribution of the subsidy I propose should be granted, but the local situation may render this unsatisfactory. Some latitude should also, I venture to submit, be given to me in regard to the amount of the subsidy and possibly with regard to the question of the settlement of a compassionate allowance to Salih al Mana, the Qatar owner of the dhow, men- Uoned in Foreign Department telegram No. S -4 .97 dated 26th August to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in case that question is raised. 3. It will be noted that the draft agreement falls naturally into three por tions, of which the 1st and second must be secured, if we are to have anythinc/ tangible from the Shaikh of Qatar in the way of a Treaty. The third portion contains several clauses that might be dropped if the Shaikh objected to them. have enclosed these portions in brackets. It would howevt r seem a pity net to try and obtain them if possible, and 1 do not imagine that the Shaikh will make dithculties over what will appear to him to be comparative trifles in respect of the to him serious obligations of stopping the arms traffic, slavery clauses and receiv ing a British Agent.

Knox, Bushire. 25-0 the 9th September 1914# Pron: the attached independent account of the quarrel betv /oen bhaikh Abdullah and his cousins, it appears that Yusuf* anoo has perhaps exaggerated the tension between them# Shaikh Abdullah does not appear to be a man of any strength of charac ter. It was with difficulty that he was persuaded to undertake the duties of Chief of Doha after the nii &amp;er of Shaikh Ahmad as he prefered pearl dealing to responsibility; and he more than on0o during his father's life time threatened to resirri owinr bo &gt;haikh Ahmad s sons not treating him with proper considera tion. Ilia present petulant attitude shows that he has not gained strength with responsibility. Shaikh Khalifah not shaikh Abdullah is Shaikh Jasim's eldest son. Uy records do ru- o sn^w why bhaikh Jasim nominatsd him as his successor. The recent quarrel has ostensibly been settled, but there is no doubt ohat /Jin .&gt;aud would find a considerable following from the malcontents among the Qatr Shaikhs, although the majority of common people apparently favour Shaikh Abdullah. ..he news in my No.24—0 as to Bin Saud's Intervention having been invoked was obtained from Shaikh Muqbil, and I think that there is no doubt that ho is being egged on from Basrah to realise his old ambition of absorbing Qatr. Consi dering Shaikh Muqbil f s relations with Bin Saud I am inclined to think that the information was in the nature of a 'ballon d^essai' . It was in the form of a message and I made no reply. It would be convenient for mo to know 'lovernment 1 s in tentions in the matter. Unless you direct me to^contrary, I pronose, if :&gt;haikh Muqbil raises matter directly, to say that Bin Prom ' To No. DatedtXonX *1' J ' ■ s .♦ : f.'ii / : . fJ j f e+inicjp ^fiuoooa b&amp;rtcASSA ortS ncr 1 iut . &gt;£ ':■ •=-!•-:■ TCTii tsniwfoo eiif hnr. rfailubcfA (,:■ «..tMf ■ -o^iJC-'o '■ ro xiw to cmm b drf ^ '^qcra .ton eeof rfrii: ■ f - 3 : '■''' 6f)rTU ot '-ajBw dff vt.Mfl^ iliiw •■1 ef{J icilfi jsrfcj lo tci.il) nr.fj -:•,- - • .'

Shaikh Abdullah negroes went on board to instruct the nakhoda to land the goats in the market and not to sell them from the boat direct. Negroes of Ahmad*s sons also had gone on board to buy goats there and then. Shaikh Abdulla's negroes told them not to buy from there but from the market. Ahmad*s sons negroes did not hear them and both parties fought. Ahmad T s negroes were wounded by Shaikh Abdulia's negroes. Upon this Ahmad*s sons became very angry and on the third day caught one of Shaikh Abdulla^s negroes and thrashed him very seriously. This made Shaikh Abdulla wrathcfull and he resolved to take revenge. He consulted the notables of the town like Shaikh Khalid, Asiri, Bin Mana* and others but they told the Shaikh that it was not fit for him to punish Ahmad*3 sons for the sake of his negroes. Shaikh Abdulla then wrote to his brothers Thani and Abdur Rahman at 'Vakra to come for his help. They came and heard everything from Shaikh Abdulla and then went to Shaikh Khalifa. Shaikh Khalifa told them that fault lied with Shaikh Abdulla who had the wrong and improper notion of punishing his cousins for the sake of his negroes. Thani and Abdur Rahman agreed with him and informed Shaikh Abdulla that he should not be so wrath- full with Ahmad*3 sons. Shaikh Abdulla got more and more excited and declared that under the circumstances he will leave Qatr and its rulership. Then the people of Qatr approached Shaikh ' Abdulla to desist from his resolution. Shaikh Khalifa the eldest son of the late Shaikh Jassim had been upholding Ahmad*s sons who go according to his advice. Shaikh Abdulla with some notables went to Shaikh Khalifa and misunderstanding between the two brothers was cleared. Next day Shaikh Khalifa accompanied with Ahmad*3 sons and other people came to Shaikh Abdulla and asked him to forgive Ahmad*s sons. Shaikh Abdulla forgave them and all shook hands and became friends. There is no friction now and nobody objects to Shaikh Abdulla*s orders.

Cox, K.C.I.E., C .S .T., Foreign Secretary to the Govtrnment of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to invite a reference to correspondence ending with my letter No. Cf. 52, dated 21st July 1914, on the subject of a proposed treaty with Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani. In my telegram No. 1042, dated 30th August 1914,1 informed you, Sir, of the satisfactory reply that had been received from Shaikh Abdullah in reply to the letter in which I announced to him that war had broken out between Great Britain and Germany. The value of that telegram is however, to some extent, discounted by reports received by last mail from the Political Agent, Bahrain, who derives his infomation mainly from Khan Maeb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo. He has also had the advantage of recently discussing the situation with Shaikh Khalid bin Muhammad bin Thani. The reports of Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo undoubtedly show that disunion reigns among the members of the Bin Thani family, and that Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim has some difficulty in holding his own. He seems to be far more tractable than the remaining members of the family, and, theoretically at all events, holds views as to the maintenance of order, equality of all before the Shara' Law and general justice which seem to mark him out as the man for our purposes. But the difficulties of his position, which he would, it might be hoped, surmount if left alone, are greatly enhanced by the tendency to intrigue with Bin Sa'ud, shown by Shaikh Khalifah bin Jasim bin Thani. The Amir would be no Arab if he did not welcome the opportunity of increasing his territory and influence and the outlook for the independence of Katar is gloomy, unless we can arrange to bolster up the authority of the Shaikh. The Turks would no doubt view with satisfaction Bin Sa'ud's advance along the coast line hoping, not without some show of reason, that it would embroil him with us. The result might be to throw Bin Sa'ud still more under Turkish influence or to weaken his prestige and authority. In either case, the Turk, who loves fishing in troubled waters, would think he stood to gain. Again, if Katar should fall into the hands of Bin Sa'ud, the consequence for the Trucial Chiefs, commencing with Abu Dthabi, are bound to be most serious. They have been severely scourged this year by the ravages of plague and, on the top of that, comes financial ruin, caused by this most disastrous war now raging in Europe. The only remedy for this state of affairs would appear to be, as has been already stated, an attempt to preserve Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani and show, in good time, by marks of our favour towards him, to Bin Sa'ud that he must reckon on our strong opposition' in the event of any intrigues tending to undermine the position of our prestige. I have been warned by Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo that any attempt at a treaty with Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani alone must be kept secret, as otherwise the Shaikh runs great danger of assassination or, at least, of being ousted by combination of his relatives against him on the charge of selling his country and their rights to the British. The fact that such an accusation is absurd and rests on no foundation does not make it harder for an Arab to believe. We are therefore faced with a small problem of considerable difficulty. The solution appears to me to lie in support, as strong as w T e can make it, of Shaikh Abdullah without for the present asking for any return and trusting to the future to bring us our reward. And here the personal factor comes into play whether Shaikh Abdullah is worth support. I have already mentioned that he appears tractable and well intentioned. The next question •—and a most important one for us—is whether he is strong and will be able to make a good use of such aid as we shall give him. Will he be Shaikh Mubarak or Shaikh Isa ? I am afraid that I must here plead guilty to absolute ignorance of his character and, as lam notsure that any other political officer in the Gulf Is m a position to give a ttiore sati'g* factory replv to the question 1 have posed abo've, nothing but personal acquain* tance with the Shaikh himself is likely to enable us to form a reliable judgment. Personal acquaintance with the Shaikh is also calculated to lead us to satisfactory conclusions as to what iorm the support to him, on which 1 lia\(' tilicady Jaid stress, should take, for I must confess that 1 am not in a position at present to put forward any definite proposals on this point any more than 1 can form an accurate estimate of the Shaikh's personal qualities. On both these points We require fuller information. While I am unable to submit more than the general lines of the policy on which I venture to think we should embark, I can, with some confidence, state that the present seems a favourable opportunity for the inception of that policy, Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani has recently addressed an appeal for advice to Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo which seems to me to show the great need in which he stands of assistance, and how fully he realises that need. A translation of this appeal was hurriedly transmitted to me at the moment of clos ing the mails by the Political Agent and, though the English is crude and faulty, evidently clerk's work, as I have not the original Arabic to refer to, I have con sidered it advisable to enclose a true copy as an appendix to this report. The meaning is clear enough. The answer I propose to send to this appeal is indicated in the following paragraph. Your telegram No. 588 -S., dated August 18th, to my address appears to put the possibility of my making any long stay at Katar out of the question. I would therefore propose to leave the report on the questions I have indicated to the Poli tical Agent, Bahrain. Should he form a favourable opinion of the Shaikh's quail- fications and power to rule, he might then sound him as to what form of support would be most useful to him and report, giving at the same time his own opinion. He might also indicate confidentially to the Shaikh the nature of the payment in the shape of a treaty which we shall at the proper time when the Shaikh's power is firmlv established, require for our services (vide enclosures to my No. Cf. 52, dated 21st July 1914). Captain Keyes has so far had only a comparatively limited experience of Arab Chiefs but, since his arrival at Bahrain, he has thrown himself con amore into all the questions connected with his charge, and I consider that he can safely be relied on to form an accurate estimate of the qualifications and necessities of Shaikh Abdullah. He will, I hope, receive valuable assistance from Khan Saheb Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo. Should, therefore, the Government of India agree generally with the conclu sions I have reached in the above statement of the Katar problem, I have the honour to request that I may be favoured with sanction to the despatch of Captain Keyes on the mission I have assigned to him. On receipt of this sanction Captain Keyes, to whom a copy of this letter is being forwarded, could arrange by corre- spondence for a meeting with Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim bin Thani when I could place the R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' at the disposal of the Political Agent for the pui' poses of the meeting. APPENDIX.

If right is proved against one I wish to make him to pay it according to justice, they stand up against it and insist m not paying up the ngl^'v ther they nor Khalifah will pay.

It is my ignorance of Arabe and Arabic that makes me very chary of expreasing an opinion. V/ere a Brahui or Baluch Chief to behave as Abdullah has done on the slightest provocation I should not look on it as having any special significance. Petulance in one of their outstanding characteristics,and it has the desired effect on the tribe;moreover the Chief is a chief by Divine Right. Abdullah,however,is not even the eldest son,and there was no particular reason why he should be made Chief. Even in Shaikh Jasim's time,Shaikh Ahmad had,in some ways,more power than the Chief. His sons are ambitious,unscrupulous and lawless. Abdullah is afraid of them and not particularly keen on ^eing Chief over such a troublesome lot. His private inclinations would,! believe,be to invite us in to bolster him up and make his pearl dealing business safe and profitable, iie kno's that any half measures on these lines would mean opposition and probably assassination. Can we go the whole way? Depott recalcitrant cousins,warn off Bin Saud,place an Agent with a small guard in Qatr and for a time at any rate,keep a Man-of-war handy. I think Yusuf Kanoo underestimates the weight of the Bin Saud element. He has frecpently told me that Bin Saud could not raise^ thousand fighting men and that a united atr could easily beat him off. He believes that Bin Saud dislikes him personally. His ever ambitione in the ^atr direction are a regular obsession, and I thini we ought to discount all his information considerably.■MI do not think that any agroonont might mako with Abdullah oould be kept secret,aa Yucuf Kanoo 3Ugge;3to; or#if it could be,that a secret agreement would help him.

It is not possible for the soldiers at Qatar, therefore, to escape either by land or by the sea, and their number is so small that however bravely they may fight, the result would only be this that most of them will lose their lives. There is no advantage in this, and the British themselves do not desire it. Under these circumstances, I, Abdul Jabbar Effendi, a Turkish officer, have come and have a message from the Chief Poli tical Officer to the effect that if the soldiers desire to leave Bidaa with military honours, i.e. with their arms and accoutrements, they will be kindly received by the Politioal Agent at Bahrain and will be sent to Basran. On their re turn there, they will be sent, after a few days, to a cold station in India where they will be looked after until the termination of the war and no barm or punishment will be fall them. The British authorities have deemed it fit to give them this opportunity so that they may abstain from useless bloodshed. If they do not accept this offer, the result will only be their ruin. ^n arrival by sailing boat at Bahrain the Commanding Officer should send the arms and ammunition of the party ashore in one boat in charge of two of his men and the remainder of the party should not land at the Agency until they have received authority from the Political Agent to do so.^'IS laddicl 'ro' ^ , tm&amp; fiiflrsA 1o noi^Bqjjooo al aqooiJ- xfaliJtiQ erfx er'.t nl b«uol ed orf oi£ eqooni riel^ujV on irrjs xiaxliiajciif a-i^lbloa ertt rol eldleooq ion ai il .rljaiaxii: 'io cte^cllv erfi \q 10 iifUJl ^cf nerfJls oqaoze of &lt;eio1eieciJ Ylev^icf rrevoworf II£l:g oa ai ledTcum Tien'i bne ^as-j ioori ^ jb IJ- aJiKvt ed' ylno Muow J-Iuaei arid xiim ^orfj al ot ei sisrfT .aevil tie [cf o^ol IIJ:7; -'norf^ lo ^0b^I r J .ji J-ofi ob asvleaffierfd' er{J r : j? rlciiixn £ t Ibrto'iTI ixidd^l luMA % l taeonBstantuoiio saefl: TrelriO e.rfj- acil ea-aaeem b ev^vrf bna emoo evad oi eiiaeb eipxbloa erfj- It J-jBrfd- ^oello oriJ- ocfr looillO l£ojt^ -QTii ame nic d - rfiiw .0.1 ^eiuonorf rf^lw ivael Ij3oarfi bevleoei ed Iliw ve lj- ^a^n-mnd'ijoooa -© t it; pIJ- lO .ttBieaQ od' ^aea ed IIlw briii niiairfjaE ojs dnegA Moo B oi t aYBi) wel a lails t d-nea ed IIlw ^erij- t e^fld- niuj edt Ltinu io JI b bortooi ed IlJtw ^orfJ- eierfw £i:LaI al noii^a -ed IIJ-w ^irecnrfalnirq io cirrjBd on law erfi 1o noid-cii^ioi •ciorfd IIjbI ner i $v l g cj Jil di: ^)ei: t eeX) evjarl ao jtiiiorfd'ujs rfcij-^iS e/iT aaelea/j noil nladads ^orl^ ijarlJ- oe ^im^oqqo aWcT dI.:fBei ei'd eJcrJ iqeooa iori ob x:erii j: .be (fa boo Id .nhn iJterii ecf ^lao Iliw jnibna-'^ioo rclijiiljba ia j^od ^llljsa xcf ijsviitjb no ■ Y^f^q erfi lo nolJiauninjB bna acna orii Jbnea bluorfa teoiW '' ri ^ ne^ el'rl r :o owi *io ©gusrlo cil ijBod' ©no enorfefi I r. r:.. v— c r.A © : j ra bn^X don bXuorla ^d'i£q ©rid lo lebnJtJBr'ei o(ts: ** laoi'J - !© 1 ! e^d tot^ ^d-tno/fiua bovieoei ©varf '^orii .oa ob110.

He com- -pialned that he had been locXed In his cabin during the whole time the ship was In each port, and that In conseet -quence he was suffering from severe Internal troubles. The first day Monanl said that he would not be fit to go to Qatar frr some time. I fe^bvlded him with ^rab dress and allowed him to go Into the bazaar. Today he told me that he had met twc^e- -serters from Qatar whom he knew, and that they had told him that ShaKar Effendl was In command there. He said that he had given evidence against Shaxar Efrendl before a Court Martial which had sentenced him to nine months 1 Imprisonment, that Shaxar Effendl was a very violent man, and would certainly have him shot If he tried to land. Rather against my better Judgment I told him that I would arrange for him to sail on the 6th:, but he said he would throw himself overboard rather than be shot as a spy. I am accordingly sending him bade to Basra. On the whole I am relieved that he won't go. From the first he struck me as a queer, exclteabie creature, and I did not think that he was up to the Job. After watch- -Ing him closely I have come to the conclusion that he is more than exclteaole, In fact quite hysterical. Monanl, who has been attending him, thinks that, tro use his own words, he Is f untrustworthy and light-headed' and a terrible liar In a petty way. He also says that he has mada his disease worse on purpose.I attacn a statement of Information whlcn he said he got from tne two deserters. He may have seen deserters, out he can't tell me anything to help me trace them, and I donH believe a single word of the latter part of the statement. My latest information from a good man whom I sent In connection with the arms' traffic is that there are 65 men In the fort and 40 earning their living In the villages. May I majce the following suggestion : - If It is still considered advisable to taKe &amp;&amp;€&amp; steps In conjunction with Shaikh Abdullah to persuade the Qatar garrison to come In and surrender, I think It would be best to send the Shaikh abetter on the lines of the one you gave AbduJ Juboar , but asking him. If he considers If feasible, to himself cause the communication Abdul Juooar waa to have made to be sent to the Commandant&gt; telling him that. If he doesn't think It feasible, a messenger win be sent from Bahrain - I have a suitable man. Or, as a second alternative, your original plan might be carried out with the substitution of bo ? messenger for Abdut Juboar. It Is quite possible that, however he Is appro- -ached. Shaikh Abdullah win not venture to declare hlm- ^tself on our side In this matter. He Is afraid of the Bin Ahmad faction, which Is pro-Turk,; and! the prolonga- -tlon of the Uar and the deiay at the Dardanelles is strengthening the hands of the pro-Turks by attracting to them others, who, though not pro-Turk in local politics, sympathise with the Turk now that he Is holding throe Christian powers off Constantinople. I only make the aoove suggestions In case It has been definitely decided to remove the garrison, but I do hot think they are doing any harm as they are, and any steps taken against tnem would prematurely raise the wholei r i , h &lt;$1 Qatar auestlon. I tninlc It wouict dg a pity to do this until you are prepared to raaKe a clean settlement of the business, as, in tne present Ktxts temper of tne country, SahiKh AMullah 1 s taxIdes with us^in this matter would, I believe, cause his fall unless we are prepared to support him, and it is imposaible to foresee the extent of tne support which might be required. some watar merchants are sure to come in here for the Ramzan pearl marxet, and I may be able to find out more aoout tne state of affairs there, out, of course the possioility of settling the question once and for an depends largely on our relations with the mainland as a whole, and of that I know nothing.

The Reoidency, Bushire, 16th August 1915. The Senior Naval Officer is kindly sending H.M.S. 'Pyramus' to Bahrain to seize or destroy all* Tangistani dhows from Northern Tan^istan i.e. Khor Koweir Goinak / Dilwar Madooinari and ashi etc. The people of the Bariki district (i.e. South Tangistan coast) remained friendly this time, I think their dhows need not be seized. I expect a number of Tangistani dhows may be at Doha and I have also heard that Shaikh Abdullah sent a present (a most useful one) of 50,000 cartridges to Rais Ali just before the affair at Dilwar began. I think it would be worth while to follow this up. I think it would be worth while for 'Pyramus' to go over there (perhaps the Commander would take you over) and take away the Tangi^tani dhows which might be taken out somewhere to be destroyed unless you think it would be ad visable to destroy them there. No doubt you will hear on board all about the Dilwar business. Rais Ali put up a very good fight apparently but his forts and town have been destroved and some date trees; it would have taken too long to cut down many. T/e are having nightly raids here. ^Jor T.H.Xeyes, I. u , t P 0 litical Agent,(JOKFIDSNTIAL. 7 J i TI10 Rssidency, Bus:lire, 161?

I was thinking of asking that 'Pyramus' which will 'be going to Bahrain tomorrow might go on from there to Doha to seize all dhows from Northern Tangistan. I think there will be a good many there. Perhaps Keyes might go over to follow up question of cartridges? Any objection?. As previously reported 35 Turkish soldiers presumably from Doha are with the Tangistanis.

All of these in the entrenched line. I requested Shaikh Abdullah||bo place the following al ternatives before the Turkish Commandant!- (a) That he should surrender, wh^n the Officers would be allowed to retain their swords and be treated as indicated in your letter sent bp Abdul Jubbar Kffondi. (b) That he should vacate the fort leaving the run^intf.ct in which case I would hand the Fort over to nhalkh Abdullatt, on the latter^ agreeing to look after the Turks, I insisted on an answer by 7 a .m. the next mominp and Shaikh Abdullah eventually agreed to settle the matter during the nipht, though he was vary anxious to bo p:iven ten days for the negotiations. I promised him 5,000/- if he arranged the surrender of the Fort without a hitch and gave ^to understand that if he failed the Kort could ho taken by ihipa. T may add that the Jhaikh was under the impression that 'Oalnoi'i ie w was a transport. 5. On the morning of the 550th I landed with (commandor Viscount Kelburn.

This also I Inrormea you you mignt Keep suo^ect to tne sanction or JSlr Percy Cox. That OlTlcer has now written to me that the mlll- -tary authorities require some more ammunition for the Turkish rifles they have captured, while you have got so few Turkish rifles that so much ammuntltlon is useless to you. I should t&gt;e much ohligod if you would send me 100 unhroKen boxes of Turkish ammunition by boat so that I may examine it and report to the Army Commander. We can then hold further correspondence on tne suuject. As regaras tne tnree Turxisn guns wnich I took away, the breech blocks and sights of these guns are miss- -ing. These pieces were doubtless removed by the Turks and buried or hidden somewnere. I should be mucn obliged ii you would employ people to ascertain where these breech blocks and sights are; and, if possible, obtain tnem for me. Guns of this sort fes^e been used against the Tang- were -siris and other tribesmen who ars attacking Busnire, and I am anxious that the ones I took away should be complete. I received news yesterday that tnese trioesmen have been severely defeated. Tnis is a good thing, as they HMe by smuggling gun-running and piracy. You will remeber that two years ago some of them attcKed a v oal boat, muraered 8 Arabs and stole tnelr pearls. It is necesdaiy for the British Government to keep these people in order, so that there may be no hindrance to the Pearl trade, U.E. T. Keyes.lb TO snaiKn Abauiian d . Jassim u.

Ever since I have been in Bahrain I have been anxious to come to Qatar so as to estaollsh real terras oi friendship between us, and I regret that my first visit was made under such conditions that we were not aDle to have a long friendly conversation. However, the outcome of my ^ will certalmy oe ftaaaflclai to you. The war In Europe has caused many changes all over the world and It behoves all Rulers to take thought as to the new con- -dltlons. On account of the fftendshlp which I have form -ed for you, I am writing to you a few words of friendly ad- -vlce In a private manner. The difficulties which you have to encounter are not hidden irom me, and I am very anxious that you should overcome them with honour to yourself and benefit to your country. There Is no douot that the best way for you to effect this is by so organising your Government that no one will think it advisable to oppose you. I hear that you are strict In the observance ot ishara. Tills is good, out you should realise that the best ohara Courts will be of little avail if the servants ol the Kuier are not capaole of keeping order and bringing otfenders oe- -fore the Courts. It is by organisation of officials that the ties tern Powers prevail, and I trust that you will understand this, and win not only appoint good Amirs in your towns with good t dawis, out win ceaselessly watch over their conduct, and reward those who do well and punish and dismiss those who fall. As I have seen, this is the great defect of Arao Rulers that from/j mistaken sense of kindness, they forgive their servant continually. Hence their servants are always lax in the performance of their duties, ans the Government is open to reproach. U.E. T.

It is now ten months that we have not reoeivsi any rations or pay from our Government, and the reasons are not due to the deficiency of our Government, God be praised, aa our Government is in a good way; but it is owing to there being no roads and no communications that we have met with this sort of thing, and today we have taken refuge in your neighbour hood, and when there are men of zeal and manhood like you and others, how can you accept that we should remain in need of certain things, and not help us with a loan of money and not do what is due. Tftis is not your character but considering what we have learnt about your piousness, and your kindheartedness and your alncerity we thought you would give us what we require therefore on receipt of our letter you should arrange a sum of Rs.2000/- for us as a loan, and with this you may buy for us 30 bags flour of the best quality such as arrived recently, and which is of full weight, and sold at Rs.18/- to 20/-, and if could be had at a cheaper rate it will be still better; but it should be new flour of full weight and the bags should be soimd in condition and not damaged and ten tins of ghee which should be neither superior aor inferior, but of middle quality and if any of your ghee remains with Abdur Rahman Hassan do not take it but settle price and we will take it from him and whatever money remains ar ter the purchase of flour you nay send it through Abdur Rahman ^asan and afterwards we will submit to you the bond, and you oblige us very much for your this kindness and your great eff ort3 and true friendship. Do not disappoint us for blame wi;i1 be due. You should consider us like divers against whom you hav 9 thousands of rupees, which you can hardly recover.

After perusal, I understood fully what you mentioned therein in kind language. I also received the enclosed letter from one who promises and am very thankful for your favour and your very kind efforts and affection; may God reward you with virtue, and bestow on you all that He may wish and order. 01 brother we have no trustworthy friend of zeal who can support the cry of Islam on this coast except you and some others also at your port, beside you and these, all others are dogs and false; their words show great difference to what is in their hearts. Just consider the case of the Christians who have all joined hands for the victory of their Government by money and by saorifioe of lives, and we, the Moslems, have absolutely no affection; neither towards our Government nor towards our Moslem brithern, as a consequence of this it is now ten months that we have not received anything from our Government neither money nor food and the reasons are firstly due to absence of roads and communioations, and secondly because they depend upon any Moslems w^o may have zeal; but we have not yet received anything from the Moslems except from two menj - a small amount according to their p-eans. We praise God and thank him. Our Government in these ^ys ia good in all respects; but the roads are closed to us, ar d we do not beg alms from any one except that we only want a ^oan but upto now we have not found anyone with zeal and desire ^ e ip us who will say H come here so and so^today the roads are c ^ 0 sed to you,and you are in need of help. Here is money and you m y take aa much as you require and hand us a bond till God gives ar ^ ^turns our money**, but now this question is beyond expec- from any person. You may just consider the question of merchants who have thousands of rupees out against the divers. Wernoi^ betAb nlrfaiA rw 'io nci tj8||| .ta now f-'f &gt;rf v t irrtbrtmratoO teo/^lC 1 1 .

S(ff) W9 may coneidered like them and be given a loan of some money which the donors may also account for as if it were out against the divers; but where is that person now who will realize these circumstances and sayings. Almighty God is very powerful and very great; all power lies in him. It is incumbent for those who are noble to ask us W hat aid we want; but they do not ask what is our requirement; because they know we are now in need of aid; but we can observe patience till they themselves come forward and offer us something in the way of loan and take a bond from us, and afterwards if this is found insufficient, we will intercede for more. This sort of help is of course incumbent on those who love to help. In ahort, on the date of the letter a boat with some Tangsiris arrived here from Mohammerah and it has been here since the last five days. They say that there is fighting at Qurnah and Girdalan , and at Ahwa z and inside Mohammerah and 6000 men of the British were killed in the vicinity of Mohammerah and 4000 at Qurnah, and that 2000 men were killed of the Muhammadans, and that the whole of the British force with which they entered Basra from the beginning upto now was 80,000 and that now there remain but 15,000 and they are very badly beseiged and very shortly their business will be settled. Insha Allah; this is what had to be conveyed to you. Kindly convey my best respects and salaams to your father and those who may be dear to you, and to Abdul Aziz Zobairi and to all friends and Moslems. Here Jawad and all ether friends give youjBalaams. About the mainland, the Ajman and the Araif have beseiged Qatif and Ojair and Hasa and you may note this. oOov^nom orios 'to nisoX J3 rtovln be s meilct o^il be* klanoo SBrst&amp;za Suo otgw 11 as ^ol inssoooQ obIB R'onohJ^M ftoer'l ^slljaeT IIlw orlw won noRTorr .IjiriJ- el eierta • riil «® 1 rra eoc i &lt;*9Woq Tic {Saotg yiev Jbni5 I l TH f woq el ho' bu &gt;(afl o^t eJcfon 10J .tnerfmuonJt f.: M .mM «* '$ • ■''■ •« *1 ©vn■ •»cfo •&gt; &gt; f -I won e^f? ew • r j^nlu^e -oe «jjj lello bna f)*! wic erroo sevleeoieff^ ^ 11 abnf-Ts.t'iis briB ,EtJ chotI r &gt;nod a e : B.j bcis tmoi lo alrTl .o-om -ro't i '•oo'r ?^nl IX' ^ aw ^nc' oiT: it ! f •.■.■r/; 5i .rrloi Ovt -. vol o-'w one ..t no Jn■ f isjonl er nuoo 'o ■. 7I9' Bliln-^nflT orfOR rictl^ d-aorf ja fotSeX od.i lo erfct no ,.tr in-Rl e eoi^l« 1 noerf R/irf .t.t hn£ rfBrrr 'tnT^rio f ttoiI aial ' [my I*£0'7l2 tje gnl^rf^ll si eierli yjor . oiT .evifi ©rli lo nerr 00C6 i-rtr f!' r (o- ^Msrl I nn ten ,; r ijs 000^ bnx ia^er^fidoM lo v.d Inlolv erW fl |)f»II- ■[ f^iei r ''- hns t am , f:rrTr.'V' f J 1 ♦ to f sli •Jiev j en 000 lo fi ! .• t'- &amp;rr.£3 J&amp;eTOvtffe yori.i Ibl.iw r f^iw eoicl .'-oliiT 1 ©rfi r :0 ©X^ # nlxxmat aieii.t won hnu 000,08 asw won o,tqjj ^ninni-^ecf' ,| ilprf^l vl.tto - •:• VTOV I t 'nnocf '■*Xv*iov n* ^ : u r &gt; - '■Cf o.t 1 ' ,1j &lt;- et t Md ;rUJ.lA a ! rrl ..' k r.t t IXiw f ^ • i;o\ oo ; lerf.tal tuov. oj ey&amp;jsl.' ?•■• r n/ ejoe^efti ined' 'ffl vevrfoo • i' fl - ( t. . ■ • RI [. i.ton r ■ JOV brs Be . ■ •&gt; •O r &lt;J' jTranslation of an araMc letter dated Shaban 1333 July 1915 from Sayed Shakir Effendi,Officer Commanding the Turllsh crarriBon at ^atr to Yusuf bin Abdur Rahman Fakhru, Bahrain. Then brother, while we were aaiting for the kind- ne88,for which we were anxious,your honoured letter arrived at an auspioioue moment,and we understood fully what you have said therein,and thanked God for your safety. Secondly, oh friend,it is now eleven months that we are confined in this place and as long as we had stores we d did not retire any thing; but now our stores are fi^nished and for this want we thought that you would show some zeal and love of help;and we appealed to you,and selected you out of all other friends as we knew you/ would not disappoitit our hopes,and therefore chose you for this burden. To-day we have become quite hopeless. Almighty God is very powerful and very great a3il all power lies in Him. And henceforward you must realise that we will be in most difficult circums tances and this,no doubt,is due to the alertness of the raoslems. Before receiving your letter,we referred to the Shaikh of this place and after very great trouble,he gave us three rafas wheat which would suffice for ten days bread ofaly.

If there is fear of this sort how then will the subscription be raised; naturally there may be one who will inform the enemy but if one wants to do any thing within himself he should not allow any one else,to take part in it,so that the news may not go out to the enemy. It is necessary that the qaestion should be treated as a secret. In short we are in the severest hardship today,and if your manhood accepts that the enemies may rejoice against us,it depends on your prudence, and if you can contribute any thing this is your day; because a friend should be useful I in the day of need, and should do his best according to his means and should not be aegligent in that respect.

I inform your honour that one of my eubjeota named Raahid bin Abdullah bin Abaid, a resident of ray territory was in the gsrvio© of my brother Shaikh Khalifah as Nakhuda in his boat called 'Uraul -henaia' whioh is employed on the pearl banks. The above mentioned Rashid committed some dishonesty in the matter of the pearls whioh the sailors of the said boat collected and a relation of the said Rashid went to my brother Shaikh Khaliftt' and advised him not to keep him as Nakhuda. Shaikh Khalifah thereupon asked what was the reason for tMs, and he replied that he had seen some pearls in his possession, and advised hln to return them because he had taken them. My brother Khalifah thought that what he had taken was of little value a~A and landed him from the boat, after he had landed him the man went to Oman. After his arrival at Oman^I larr:e pearl of fine quality was found in his possession, and, according to reports spread by people who discovered his dishonesty, he sold it for a considerable sum, although he might have sold it at a low rate because it was stolen property and he had concealed it. -en this newa reached us. Shaikh Khalifah proceeded to the Oman ooast and found the thief in Shargah, and then he aTmroach- ed the Ruler of the piaoe. On his arrival he spoke to him and sromiaed to produce the thief before him; but it appeared to Shaikh Khalifah as if the Ruler of Shargah had been tempted by a portion of the price of the pearl, and this news reached my K( A jXjUUi'. brother, Shaikh, in a secret manner from some of t^e servants of the Ruler of Shargah, and when they talked about the matter to ^aikh Khalifah they promised him to settle the case the next ^ a/ i and when the following morning arrived, t^ie Ruler Oj gone back his previous word. Then Shaikh ■ halifah a3lr ed them to produce the thief so that he might speak t6 him; butbut they refuoefl him that, and would not allow him to see^him, expreasing regret, and w^en it was made certain that they had no intention of doing justice and giving him his rights, he returned from there. Shaikh Khalifah has however obtained o^missions from some merobants of. the coast, one of whom is Khalid bin Ibrahim bin Yusuf, before tehom the said Rashid bin Abdullah bin Abaid admitted and acknowledrei that he had a pearl, a large one of good quality; and the said Khalid questioned him as to how he got this pearl, to which he replied that he had purchased it ' from a negro at Qatar; and he has also other admissions besides• Further Abdullah bin Gultan, resident of A1 ^han informed him that on observing, that the above mentioned Rashid was spending much money, he questioned him as to whence he ^o + the money, and he replied that he had sold a p &gt;arl for £.2000/- and further two men of those who had fone with Khalifah met the said Rashid bin Abdullah bin Abaid and questioned him about the case of the pearl to which he renlied that he had sold the pearl to Hin L l Ataibah and that even if It had been brought before Khalifah he would not have given it to him. This is a part of the evidence against him, and T am sub mitting the case and complaining to you praying for justice in the case of this thief, and I am sure that the justice of the High Government of C!reat Britain will not nut up with a deed so this is an affair in which disgraceful as this; and/l cannot Iree-n silence because certainly the pearl is a very valuable one, and the case is being referred firstly to ftod and secondly to you. If you like you may send for him (Rashid) to Bahrain where Shaikh Khalifah or his agent will be present too for a trial of the case, or you may send him to Qatar as he is my subject,, and the matter is referred firstly to Ood and secondly to you in that respect and in conclusion I pay you my best resnects and salaam.G onf l^en t j. al_Tel egr am. from Keyes, F.A., Bahrain, To Sir P.Cox, P.R., Basran. ?

A beg to report that in the 11th ZihiJ.jah 1333 (=13th October 191') Khalifah bin Shaikh Jasim of Qatar arrived at Shargah and took up hi a residence with the Shaikh of that place. Khalifah arrived first at Abu Dhabi and then came to Uibai whence ho has now come to i3har/?:ah. He has a letter on his person from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to that of Shargah recommending him to the latter. Khalifah has lodged a claim against a certain man of Qatar, who has been residing for some tiias years at Khan, which belongs to the Shaikh of Shargah, alleging that the man ■ has stolen pearls at Qatar and sold them at Abu Dhabi to the worth of £.2,000 and that he should recover the money realised from the sale of the pearls at Abu Dhabi. The man, who married recently at Shargah, repudiates Khalifah*3 claim and asks him to produce proofs in supprrt of it. The leading men of Shargah are astonished by Xhalifah's claim, seeing that he is from the house of the Shaik of Qatar and that his brother is Abdullah bin Jasim, shaikh of Qatar, which is reported to have been occupied by the British Govem- raent, and do not know how he possesses a letter from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in connection with this claim.

The following account of an incident in Qatar Rivee a good idea of the relatione between Shaikh Abdullah and hig el^er brother, Shaikh Khallfah. w Thieves came to the house of Abdur Rahman bin Kamal and neighbours, but none oame, 30 he fired a pistol inside to frighten the thieves! they still did not desist, so he opened the door and fired two shots killing one and wounding another. It happened that the thieves oame from the neighbourhood of Shaikh Khalifah, so he sunmoned Abdur Rahman and fined him Rs.600/- for firina: at men who were his neighbours. Shaikh Abdullah warned his brother that^this was not justice and that the deed deserved reward, but Shaikh TThalifah did not take this advioe, as he felt it a disgrace that men of his neighbourhood had been shot by this man; and Shaikh Abdullah did not continue his interference for fear of friction with his.brother, so Abdur Rahman has left Ciatar saying it is *haram r to live in a place where there is no justice. 2. I would enquire, with reference to my 62 and 655.0. of November 2l3t:, if any action is to be taken with reference to Shaikh Khalifah 1 s claim against Rashid bin Abdullah who had taken refuge in Shargah. 3.

The upshot of this is that Shaikh Abdullah accepts the Articles marked [, II, 111, \ I, A II, IX and X, with certain reservations, but says he does not feel able lor the present to subscribe to:— Article IV, —Heception of British traders and an Agent, Article V. —Limitation of duty on British goods.

I would recommend another attempt to get the treaty signed without alteration, in order to keep it in line with those in force in the case of the other Shaikhs in treaty with us, but I think we might give Shaikh Abdullah a separate letter at the same time explaining that it was important to have the treaty worded on the same lines as others, but assuring him that we have no intention at present of pressing for fulfilment of Articles IV, A' and VIII, As long as our right in each of these respects is clearly enunciated, I think we can allord to reserve them for the present for the reason that, if trade and harbour facilities progress at Bahrain, as they are doing, the trade for the greater part of the Katar Peninsula will depend upon Bahrain, \vhen we shall have practical control over it. 6. As regards Article VI of the General Treaty, I am of opinion that it would be best for Shaikh Abdullah to sign the treaty as a whole but with the reservation above the signature in regard to the above Article that he does not subscribe to Article VI. 7. Unless the Government consider that there is sufficient urgency a l )01 ^ the matter to necessitate its being pushed immediately, 1 contemplate, it a gees well, getting away for a week or ten days during the coming hot wcat er, to visit Katar and endeavour to get the treaty put through.

I attach copies of the correspondence with GovernmeTit, as per cover, in^ list, which will show you clearly what is contemplated. I also attach a printed copy of the draft treaty, edited in pursuance ol the recent correspond ence, together with an Arabic translation made here. This latter is merely sent as a basis for you to work upon, and I must ask you to take responsibility for tbe Arabic version of the treaty as ultimately concluded. Should you find yourself in a position to get the treaty signed upon the spot, subject only to ratification bv Government, you should sign your own name as 'representing' or ' on behalf of ' the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. It is probable that Major Keyes, Political Agent, Bahrain, will have been transferred to Basrah for duty before you leave on this duty; but 1 shall be glad if you will call at Bahrain en route, and if Major Keyes cares to accompany you, take him along. 4. As regards funds, I would be inclined, if I were you, to take ten thousand rupees with you in cash. I can hardly suppose that that will be enough, but if you need more, you can give drafts on Bushire or Basrah. If His Majesty's Government want an Arms Traffic clause and at the same time wish to avoid payment of subsidy, I think they must expect to pay a hand some donation, sutficient to tempt the Shaikh, but, in accordance with their instructions, please do your best to keep the figure down. 6. I also attach the following : — (i) Copy of letter addressed to Major Trevor, Bushire. (ii) Copy of letter addressed to Senior Naval Officer. (iii) Original letter addressed to Shaikh Abdullah for delivery, with translation for your information. (iv) Memorandum of observations regarding details of treaty, for your guidance.

The Lawrence having left Bahrain on 19th October, anchor?] • Doha Bav about noon on the 20th; and I and Major Keyes called on Shail!! Abdullah at 4-30. We were received by him with friendliness, and, as fa 7 1 could see, with an absence of suspicion and mistrust. This interview uf devoted to the establishment ol cordial relations. 3. The Shaikh came on board the following day by arrangement 2 p.m . ; and, after the usual polite remarks, 1 ascertained from him that he'wa really desirous of having intimate relations with His Majesty's Government' that he recognised the fact that such relations must contain elements of ad' vantage to both sides, and that lie pielcired to hear first ^hat we reoui^d of him. I then read Clauses I and II ol our drait treaty followed by copies of the mutual undertakings with the irucial Chiefs to which they refer, makin® from time to time the necessary explanations. No objection was made to any of the provisions of these latter except to Article 0 ot the General Treaty which appeared to cause some uneasiness, and is, in fact, somewhat difficult to explain at an early stage of negotiations with one who is a comparatively new acquaintance. I, therefore, dropped it for the time being; and the Shaikh accepted the remainder of the articles and undertakings, expressing his grati tude for the promises made in return. Clause III relating to the arms traffic was then discussed. I impressed upon the Shaikh the important fact that all our friends among his fellow rulers were now working with 11 is Majesty's Government for its suppression; and described in particular the co-operation of Shaikh Mubarak; pointed out to him that arms could no longer be obtained from Maskat; and explained carefully the- suggested arrangements whereby he might be supplied with arms for personal and State use. The Shaikh agreed that the trade had practically ceased, and remarked that quite recently some Afghans had visited the port with a view to the purchase of rifles, and had returned to their country empty-handed. He promised to think the matter over, and 1 did not press for an immediate reply. We then proceeded to discuss Clause IV regarding the admission of British subjects to Katar for the purpose of trade, and I was rather surprised to find that Shaikh Abdullah was not at all inclined to accept this. He said that the people of Katar were still strongly anti-foreign, and would not consent to the reception of foreign traders, and that he would be in constant fear of trouble resulting to himseii from the bad treatment of such persons by his people, and that the opportunity would be taken by his enemies to place him in ditiiculties with His Majesty's Government. He assured me that he had no personal feelings on the subject, and that his fear of the presence of a British Agent did not in the least mean that he objected to British guidance and control; but he showed so much distress of mind that, after a time, 1 was obliged to leave the question with the remark that he need not tear that His Majesty's Government would ever hold him or any other Shaikh in treaty relations with them responsible for what he had done his best to prevent. Passing over Clause V, I read and explained Clause VI which presented no difficulty. The Shaikh wished to know how Mubarak of Kuwait and Isaot' Bahrain treated any communications which reached them from the Agents of nationals of other Governments; and received with interest and approval the accounts given by Major Keyes and myself in reply. Clause \ II he was likewise disposed to accept without demur; but, in regard to \ 111, said that, though he recognised and appreciated the advaoi- ages ol post and telegraph oliices, the diliiculty in regard to foreigners would untortunati ly come in there. Hie Shaikh was by this time showing signs of fatigue, and I postponed further discussion lor the day, having read over 10 him the remaining clausts ol the draft treaty, saying that he now knew all we required of him, and tlw 1 hoped he would give tne question of tne admission ol British subjects furt er consideration, as it was ditlicult to suppose that His Majesty's (joveiuiaen 'VMiuld readily recognise a true friend in one who would not allow taeir subjects to trade in las dominions.30 4. Tl.e next clay Major Keyes and I risiW the Shaikh, and referring to Clauses IX and X of the draft treaty, I asked him to describe without reserre difficulties of his position of which we had already heard some thin or • and to make any suggestions he wished as to the help we might eive him. He said in reply that his cousins and elder brother, Khalifah, were enrious of his positiou, and always ready to intrigue againsr him with Abu Dhabi, an ancient enemy, or others, whenever opportunity offered. I suggested that a treatv between him and His Majesty's Government would bring them to see the necessity of abandoning this course; and he admitted their fear of reprisals by us in the event of an attack upon him, but added that they ha^ alreadv tried to employ the recent events at Doha, in connection with the Turkish garrison, as a means to set local opinion against him on account of his leanings towards us . I asked what the effect upon the people had been. He admitted that it had not amounted to much, and that these enemies could not injure him to any great extent without help from outside, upon which I pointed out that Abu Dhabi, being bound by the undertakings we hav^ read yesterday, could not take steps against him without coming directly into contact with us, provided that Katar had likewise joined the signatories. I questioned the Snaikh regarding bis fighting strength and that of his unfriendly relations, and was told that he was only afraid of a field-piece which is in the possession of his brother Khalifah, who has a small estate on the shore about 4 miles north of the port of Dona. He asked whether Government would give him a Turkish or some other gun superior to Khalifah's, which, though service able, is of old type, and I promised to refer the request in due course. Shaikh Abdullah then went at great length into tbe provisions of Clauses IX and X of the draft treaty, and put up various hypothetical cases in order to find out, as nearly as possible, the extent to which Government would be prepared to support him by land. I represented that I had not the power to Lv exactlv what Government would do in any particular case, but pointed to the satisfactory condition of Chiefs who had committed themselves entirely to us and showed that the extent of our support would depend upon that of his confidence in us and the loyalty or otherwise with which he earned out his obligations. This explanation was accepted as satisfactory. A leno-thv discussion then took place upon tbe other clauses of the treatv, particularly upon that relating to the admission of British traders. The Shaikh had evidently given deep consideration to this subject, but could not bring himself to agree to the insertion of Clauses 1\ , \ and \ iii. i used every possible argument, but without avail. In regard to the Arms Traffic, the Shaikh asked what he should do in the event of a dhow filled with arms for sale arriving at is port a. e undertaken to join in the suppression of the traffic. I ' t u e „ Tms discussion, that he could either send tbe boat awa\, or c . . wbicb could be set against the number allowed for yearly imporuuon, a^ He wished Shaikh Abdullah then intimated that he ^ditk^W (and to publish the pr^lamation £S ar ^ lD f ' 16 f t ' en-a -cments with the Clauses 1,11, VI, VII, IX and X and tbose ot the enga^ ^ Trucial Chiefs which are not peculiar to one or more » tion of Article VI of the &lt;4 General Treaty '. 5. In conclusion, I asked the Shaikh to gire me a reply for Government in his own words. He said:— ,. , t ' Please tell them that I will gladly a ble to accept you have put to me, and that I am very S0Il - v * n res identt in my country at British or any other foreign subjects aft permanent ^ sl ^ p^ple are not'yet present. 1 would welcome them gladly afriid Bufficiently civilised, nor is my rule sufficient y , trUC J 0Ilt if i allowed of serious trouble, WDicb could only end in ms temporary foreigners in row. You may add. however, ^ Government difiicultv which i hope a few years will remove, 1 present, to consider *iU allow Clauses IV, V and VIII to stand over for the P^, „ them again later and to accept them at as ear,Major Keyes and I then took our departure and returned to IT ir ' Lawrence ' which left that evening for Bahrain and Basrah. 6. The clauses refused by the Shaikh, being among those m V ^ you as essential, I was not able to enter into treaty without reference / r ^ authority and H. M. S. ^Lawrence'' being obliged to return to the si ^ r Arab for water almost immediately prevented me from enterino i \ att ' a ^ graphic communication with you. 3 11 0 In consideration of the Shaikh's remarks given above, and the fa f the position is much as stated by him, I am disposed to recommend th t i Government of India may be pleased to accept the explanation ^ r inability to admit British traders into his dominions for the present 0 ] negotiate the remainder of the draft treaty on the understanding th f 0 subsidiary agreement regarding the clauses omitted will be made subsecmonH 1 am convinced tiiat Shaikh Abdullah will abide loyally by the engaeem f into which he is now prepared tfenter, and I believe that practical experien ! of our encouragement and support will increase his reliance on ns vv K ;^ really all that is necessary. ' 18 It is quite possible that, should we decline to treat with him without ikv clauses, he might ultimately agree to their inclusion under protest, but unle® it is considered that there is any urgency in regard either to the admission of traders, or a British Agent, or both, the acceptance for the present of the Shaikh's explanations will pay us best iu the long run, as it will in mv opinion, be more likely to win his confidence and regard. ' I am averse, generally speaking, to coercive measures with Arab Chiefs except in cases of obvious breaches of engagements. a \ S Z 31 as e0u ^ ^ eai 'ned from the interviews described above bhaikh Abdullah does not appear to be a strong character, but his position is certainly not an enviable one as he is at present situated, and allowance must be made for that. A\ e will be better able to form an estimate after some expenence of his adherence or otherwise to the engagements specified in the treaty. . -^ To Q^sjion of monetary payment arose at any period of my discus- sions with Shaikh Abdullah, and it would obviously not have done to suggest any in connection with Clauses IV, V and VIII. 9.

Oofc- _ . . Captain, First Assistant Resident. A No.55 dated E6th Fehruary 1916 and enclosure from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Translation of a letter Ho. 55 dated 26th February 1J16 from the Eesidenoy Agent, Shargah, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, il l I 'beg to aoimowledge the receipt ot your letter 1^0.423 dated 21st December 1915, containinf? copy of a letter from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim on the subject of his brother's claim against Bashed bin Abdullah bin Abeid for the robbery of pearls when he was a Nakhuda in the boat Umm-ul-Hanaya. I beg to state that I reported the natter to you in my letter No.432 dated 20th October 1915 for your information. Shaikh Xhalifeh, when he did not succeed in hi claim, did not come to me to ask for assistance that there might have been failure on my part about him and I believe that it is not the duty of the Residency Agent to inter fere with the people in claims without being called upon to do so, or to mix himself up with a case which is 'b ing dealt with by the Shaikh and his guest. Shaikh Ihalifeh bin Jasim was the guest of the Shaikh of Shargah. I be^ to forward herewith statements made by ■ Hashed tin Abdullah and his father Abdullah bin Abeid, in which they decline the robbery and state that th^r are pearl traders in two boats and that two years ago he left Shaikh Khalifeh 1 s boat, he becane a Nakhuda in his father 1 s vesisel. From enquiries made by me it appears that when Shaikh Khalifeh learned that Bashed bin Abdullah in his voyage trom Qatar to had visited A*u- D hahi and sold pearls to a merchant of the latter place named Khalaf bxn for . l.«. »'• '' 1 ' a filns .»» hi. . present .t 4 h.»ee. r«r the StoiM of Abu- Dhabi. i. hop. .he. h. .i^. be .bbe to M . 1. 1B . . oW. ,h ' k '' r ° r ' U * r ' way did. did not find what he had been told. Shaikh Khalifeh then visited Shargah with a letter of introduction from the Shaikh of Abu-Dhahi to the Shaikh of Shargah and he was the guest of the latter and lodged a claim against Hashed 'bin Abdullah who was seriously ill and about to die. The Shaikh of Shargali told Shaikh Khalifeh that Hashed was ill and that it was far better for him to refer his case to the Shera Court when Hashed got well. Shaikh Khalifeh, however, did not agree to a settlement of the case by Sh^ra. He then left Shargah as he could not get his object. When I went on board the 'Britonart' and stayed there for a few days, I happened to see the Shaikh of who is said to have bought the pearl from Bashed bin'W-s Abu-Dhahi and Ehalaf bin Ataibeh^ I made enquiries fr m Khalaf about the purchase of the pearls and he said that he did not buy pearls from Hashed and that the news was sent to Shailch Khalifeh by the enemies of Rashed. in my opinion, according to the statements made hy Hashed and his father and what I heard from Shalaf bin Ataibeh. Shaikh Khalifeh should produce proofs in support of his claim in the Shera Court. ' pearls robbed by divers do not remain hidden for four years particularly if the accused be a pearl trader and carries on the trade every year. It is pos sible that if he has the pearls with him he nigh, rr.ix it up with his own pearls and dispose of it after two 1 '' r ' Bashed tiln hafl a bousa at Khan 'han he J OOhht i. a— -M no. «. »•'■ a.oQ^flinp' in a place t..e^ * oH ions as they are residing in slaves and as long a ^ to +v 1 nritv of the Chief of the place have/abide by the authority 01 , eav9 it they should be called upon to pay and when they lea ve .Ul» «h.r. .16' ' «—■' t&gt; '•'Statement made by Rashed bin Abdullah bin Abe id froo the Sudan tribe of Bada 1 , against 'whom Khalifeh ben Jasim who was brought a claim for robbery of a pearl, dated 13th Rabi II, 1334- ( 24th January 1^16) States tiiat when he was at Qatar in the employ of his father Abdullah bin abeid and was acting as the ^'akhuda of his father's boat called Malulash, Khalifeh bin Jasim re quested Rashed's father to allow Rashed to be the Jakhuda of Khalifeh's boat called Umm-ul-Hanaya.

After two years Abdullah, Rasned s ^au-.er, s-L.-ere^ losses on account of the two boats ovmed by -inself and Rashed consequently left Khalifeh' b boat and became a I--huda in his father's boat called Malulash for two years. After the termination of the diving season in the year 1352.

As now worded it is intended to protect jriti^h li^-ian merchants residing in jftlirein consigning goods to tlietr agents in ^atar. I was prepared, as authorise ^ to eliidn o the next three Articles if it should prove neoessar-, but the alternative course of allowing tbeia to Pin.a while owfposxini. action on thorn by a separate letter seemed referable, as^ obviating the alteration of the Treaty at Bona future ti e, and the poa ihle citation to us by other bhaikhr of the special treatment of C.atar in these rv ieot*. I trust the Govornnentimm las oj&gt; di i •oE .ii • ■ r- . •■) ; . ' -7Al Govornmont of India will be of like opinion. (5) v subsidiary loiter to Shaikh Abdullah JIe first pressdd for a definite respite of 10 years from the operation of these articles as well as for the assurance that they should not he put into effect without his acquiescence. While not agreeing to specify any particular period I thought I might safely say that action would not be taken on the Articles in question without securing his consent, seeing that ultimately we are in a position to compel concurrence, or to c ange Abdullah for a Chief who would accord it, should the matter ever become of sufficient urgence.I have little doubt however that now that our relations with Qatar have been placed on an assured an • dnfinite basis those d^sidsrata will be secured ^ without much difficulty in the course of time. (6) As regards the question of slaves already existing in Qatar the riovernment of India will realise that if Political Officers were to take any ill-considered line of action in the direction of manumission of Qatar slaves pursuant to the con clusion of this roaty Shaikh Abdullah's position amoi!g nis dependents would straightway become extremely difficult, the trade in new slaves at all events by sea has practically ceased to exist in the Gulf of late years; a few no doubt continue to be brought over from the Mecca side, but very few; and among those already here it is found that apart from the initial evil of the truck-system on which from time irimemorial the pearl fisheries have been run, cases of serious maltreatment are by no means common, nor are the Shaikhs concerned unamenable to advice• I am of opinion therefore that bot 1 our requirements and the interest of the negroes will be adequately safeguarded by our making our abstention from interference contingent on the hypothesis that the shaikh and his dependents treat thei slaves fairly. Shaikh Abdullah has assured me that he nil be at pains to see justice done in any cases which are brought to his notice. In this connection it will bo remembered that in the case of Kuwait wo have no Slave Agreement at all an m th quickly ir p roviiiK con ions 1^1 civilising influences ;' iv fiibnl h, msyoii io\ IAs®snc I ^Mvii ' boiteq nzivzUizq stgb y^vqz oi $ftipr\&amp; m i wtiuiru *&lt;ii ftf fidifiJ &amp;ci ion rT ^w ' oiv^- ;of the present day we are getting on satisfactorily without one. {^) 1 was prepared in connection with the negotiation of this Treaty to be asked by Shaikh Abdullah to take action against his disaffected elder brother Shaikh Khalifah, but their relations seem to be a little nore satisfactory at present. I offered, if Abdullah wished, to sen-^ for Khalifah and give him a homily and a warning, or to write one to He , but the Shaikh thought it was not necessary at present, but said he would ask for such help later if the circumstances made it unavoidable. He thought Khalifa*s line of action i would be, not any open opposition, but the incitement o. bedouins to harass Qatar so as to discredit his (Abdullah's; rule. (8) i *o money passed between r-yself and Abdullah; the ^ necessity for any payment did not arise, i^e shaikh however explained that owing to the stoppage of all supplies of arns in the market since his accession he was very short of them and begged me if possible to let him have some in the same way that we had supplied others of our friends. I told him that the matter depended on what we had to spare at : a noment, as .a had had so many such appeals; but that I would sse what could be done when I got back to BasraV . : a:;' Abdullah was very friendly and cordial throughout and I t ink quite realises which side his bread is buttared. (9) Captain Fowle Acting Political Agent, Bahrein, acconpanied me, and I alno took with cie Haji lusuf Kanoo, a prominent merchant of Bahrein (and possessor of the Kaiser-i- Itind Hadal) who is Shaikh Abdulla's commercial agent in Bahrein and has his confidence.

I her to inform you that at a personal interview 1 had with the Secretary of the Shaikh of Qatar, he told me that as the pearl market this year had been no had 'both t^o Jhaikh and his subjects had suffered very heavily and in consequence he enquired whether the Government would oo prepared to lend the &gt;hai&gt;;h money, should he approach them with a view to raising a loan of 3 to 5 lakhs of rupees* I expressed my sympathy with the ;hail r h and his subjects and informed him that I could not rive him a def ifiite answer immediately on behalf of the ovom oi.t, \ ut that I felt sure his request if made, would deceive the sympa thetic consideration of the Government. I cannot trace a copy of Foreign Department circular -o•41574-1 .A. dated 12th December 1907 reirardincr loann and dont know how they would view the matter,but my ners nal opinion is that 3haikh of Qatar should be encourarexito r^iao the loan as it would certainly ?ive us a err eater influence over him and would certainly later on enable us to sret better Treaty rights.

After oompllTnents iou askei me to write a 'brief note from the history of events which passed between the Rulers of Bahrain and atar. I am to say in reply that there events took place long time ago and before my birth,and I am unable to describe them in details/the years during which these events took place, and especially at this short and narrow time; but however I write below what I remember without actual yearsy but I will be able to describe them on my return home. Great enemity existed in the past between the Rulers ^ ahrain and . v atar and this of course was created by their covetous nature to ccllsct wealth. Several fights took place between them when Ali bin :hali- fah and his brother : uharamad were rulers of Bahrain, and uhammad bin hani .^uler o ^ , atar, and 1 irn ing bet reei them used to be favourable to neitiie 1 ' side t-nrouf^oi o neither party could defeat the other. curing a cessation o^ the fights in question the A1 Khalifah called Q,asim bin uhammad bin I'hani to them on t e plea of making friendship and giving up fighting and sue ing for peace and vhsn iAuharira I bin Thani trusted and s^nt his non asirn to them at Ba he -vas arrrsted and imprironed and thereupon they expited a larre force in order to occupy Qatar. ihe peo-le c 0 Uatar were extremely grieved when they learnt that t .-ir Amir ^'as imprisoned and started crying out an - I a force in order to defeat that force which had b^ n sent to attack them and subsequently both these for-es encoun-encountered eachother on the coaet of M Wakrah ( a village o Qatar) . Here tlie A1 Khalifah force wac defeat ed and t '.e men were detained as prlsonere until their • impriron^d Amir yrao liberated. This was immediately done, as t e Kuler of Bahrain liberated Qasim and sent him to his territory with honour and lieu of this their Lhaifchs were liberated. A short time after the occurence of these erents ,;uhammad bin j'hani died and after hir death hit eon i aslm succeeded him as ruler. Ali and Aleo /hir brother uhammad died after some events having taken place between the two brothers and Lhaikh Isa then became the Huler of Bahrain, and his paternal cousin Nasir bin .ubarak M Khalifah fought him on account of the rule of Bahrain and some skirmishes took place between them and upon this Shaikh Isa passed orders for deportation of iiasir from Bahrain and hir p are of property to be occupied. Kasir then took shelter with Shaikh Qasim bin Thani and asked his help and he helped him accordin to the cup torn of Arabs and ill-feel in* existed for a long time between the Rulers of both tahrain and C v atar for the reasons stated above. he Kuler of , t atar then immediately fitted a sailing battle phip taking .asir A1 Khalifah to ahrain. When Shaikh Isa learnt the news he was terribly affraid and asked the &gt;ritish government through their Political Arent for help and this officer communicated with the Turkish Government at -ana through tneir Commispioner, Ibrahim Pasha and after exchange of some communications between the two, the Political Agent got into a man-of-war and sailed out to encounter the above mentioned sailing battle ship v/hich was coming to lahrain. hen those neor^le (of Qatar) came to now the facts t. ey with ire-', back with their shi 1 - in orier not to meet the British ships and ais the war the nearert port to t er they took sheltc 1^ it and yet t e -ritish s ips persved them up to theis, and fired some sliells after giving t em' ar* witrrinr, and burnt POTT&gt;e boatp and sine© then as nothing ha© happened which can be re??einbered fcx C atar people Knew that the britieh G -OTerninont had ttrong intereete of interference in warlike matters, /.e repardp t^e IVviAdhh as it would arpear to me that itc evacuation and isolation was out of hear for 3oha in order not to be occupied as the inhabitation of ;\irabah ic disadyan- tapeoue to rvxckcit Doha* this is all I know whic I have stated to your honour and I hope you will excuse me for this brief note out of hurry &amp;b I wrote this when I was on the steamer 'Palitana'.

Shaikh Ahdulla 'bin Qasim al Thani Ruler of Qatar to E^ji Tusuf •j^xn Ahmad Kanoo • In an auspicious hour I received your kind letter dated thQ Rth Shawwal 1^35 and was glad to hear about your welfare. TrTh August 1915. I duly understood all that you mentioned. The Political Agent s letter which you sent me enclosed with your letter also reached me. The political Agent with two men-of-war reached here on the 7th Shawwal 1355 . They wished me to see them on hoard . 19th August 1915 when I went they talked to me about the Turkish garrison in this place. They wanted to take them prisoners and to take arms and away their/ammunit ions . I withstood them by words but could not find a way. I then asked them for time till one O'clock Arabic next morning. As they did not wish to surrender and their being taken prisoners was possible for they were not able to withstand the British, the (Turkish) soldiers ran away to the interior during the night. In the morning (the British Officer and soldiers) came ashore and took on board three guns and went away. This is what happened. Kindly let me know all news you hear. I am ready to execute all your requirements. Please give my salams to Jasim and his brothers and from this side my brothers and sons send you compliments. May you be preserved and salams.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fd_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/30</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fd</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/30</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File No: E.7.
