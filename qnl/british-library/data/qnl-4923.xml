Sir, Now that the Political Agency at Kerne it has been es tablished it seems aavisable that the question oj' communi cations should be tatfen under consideration without delay I have the honour therefore to comnit the question to the attention of the Government oj Inaia. B. pr.sent communication is limited to a fortnightly visit of the slow British India mail steamer. Letters can occasionally be got to Koweit through the Clerk in Charge oj the Cable office at Fao, but that method is uncertain and risky owing to the clcs&amp;Tiess with which the movements of messengers to or j'rom Sheikh lubarek are watched by the Tn PcsTurks # y ■3. T nave the honour to suggest for the consideration ' ovarw lent: ~ hj at Kvwe it # The British India Company mould probably find it most convenient to arrange for the up mail to do this, Che leaves Bus hi re on Thursday evening would call at i owe it at daybreak Friday and roach Pussorah Friday evening or Saturday morning. ' . Very probably the Government cf India has already con sidered these questions, and in any case I feel sanguine that Pis excellency the Viceroy in Council mill hold that having now put our hand to the plough as regards Kowoit, i&gt; is important that ms should make our position there as strong as possible and that without delay.

Sir I r . 0’Conor in paragraph 5 of his despatch to Sir E. Grey Fo: 105, dated 18th February 1907, has drawn particular attention to the importance of this agreement as affecting future negociations regarding the debouche of the Baghdad Failway. 5. Another strong argument in favour of the proposal is that owing to the outbreak of plague in Bahrein it has become necess ary to adopt quarantine measures at Koweit. These have been placeod under the supervision of the British Assistant Surgeon with the concurrence of the Sheikh. In view of Dr. Thomson’s report it appears probable that it may be necessary in the near future to establish a regular quarantine station there, in which case tele graphic communication would be essential. 13 v f' ^ Other practical adantages which •ucul'df cri .ue from the estab lishment of telegraphic communication with Koweit are described in Bajcr Knox’s letter Fo: 50, hlated the 13th January 1907, of which a copy is enclosed. To these we may add that, if telegraphic communication existed, we should be in a better position than tt present to deal with the large demands made by the British India Steam Favigation Company for the continuance of the fast mail service touching at Koweit. The present subsidy for the mail service is Es 5,00,000 a year and a claim was advanced for an ad ditional sum ci one lakh il the service was to be maintained on its present footing, lor the present the claim has not b^en pres sed but it may be revived, and we should like in that event to be ^ aDle ‘t'O feej. that independently of the mail service we had secured prompt and certain communication with this important point in ahe Gulf. UcJ BUbm it herewith a memorandum which has been prepared by bhe Director, Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Depart ment, irom which it appears that the initial cost of effecting the cable connection would be Es 1,84,800 apart from yhe charges for a residence for the signallers and an office, while the an nually recurring expenditure to be provided for wduld tocunt to Esn 0 / amount to Ks 7 120/-. We agree with Major Knox that, iT the con nection is made, the telegraph station should be located at Kas- el-Arz with a land-line to the Political Agent's Office, and this would involve the additional advantage arrangementyythat we should secure control of the headland on Vide correspondence ending with our Secret ( which a tide- at the instance of the Admiralty. 7.

I need not trouble Government with a repetition of views and arguments already figuring in the previous correspondence, in favour of the linking up of Kuwait. They do not appear to have lost any force generally during the last . Meanwhile the Arms Traffic menace has become much more acute;— particularly, at present, the contraband traffic into and out of Kuwait the sup pression or control of which is of just as much importance to the Porte in Turkish Arabia as it is to Great Britain in the Persian Gulf. The position then is that at the present juncture we have the most obvious and cogent grounds for making wireless telegraphic connection with Kuwait, solely as an item of our Arms Blockade operations, and I submit that if the project is so proceeded with, as a blockade urgency, the Porte will be unable to oppose to the measure such arguments as at other times they might seek to introduce, to the effect that the connection is neither seriously needed nor likely to pay commercially, or that it is an alteration of the status quo. Heaving regard to the trend of Turkish policy under the new regime it seems clear that the longer we defer action the more difficult will it become, while the specific and excellent opportunity which is offered us at present will lapse with the cessation of our blockade or the achievement of a political under standing with France for the control of the traffic, and will never occur again. I earnestly hope, therefore, that the Government of India will feel able to press the measure upon His Majesty’s Government and urge the advantage of acting at once. Locally it is always the first step which is difficult in these matters, and in the present case, once a wireless station is installed, even ostensibly as a temporary measure, the Kuwait public will come to appreciate the utility and convenience of it while the Basra authorities will get used to it so that any subsequent diffi culty in making the station a permanency would seem to be unlikely.

I have the honour to invite a consideration of the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement, No, 275, dated the 3rd February 1907, regarding the possible extension of the Bushire-Fao Telegraph cable to Fao. 2. All the reasons, political and commercial, which have been advanced already in favour of establishing telegraphic communication with Kuwait, apply with added force at this date, 3 years later, in view of the recent political changes in Turkey and the natural commercial growth of Kuwait. At that time I understand it was found that the initial cost of laying the necessary cable-loop and subsequent annual expenditure on the local station would be quite incom mensurate with the possible advantages.

My dear Cox, I am desired to refer to your letter No. 1522 dated 5th June 1910, on the subject of the overtures of the present Wali at Busreh to Sheikh Mubarek, in the hope of in ducing him to agree to the installation of a land telegraph line from Busreh or Fao to Koweit. Xou express a hope that an improvement in the financial out look may now, perhaps, make it possible for the Government of India to take into lively consideration the question of a wire less installation at Koweit. The Government of India, like yourself, recognize the desirability of establishing a wireless installation at koweit, and it was suggested here that it might be possible to add Koweit to the list of stations, at which we hope to get sanction for a temporary installation in connection with the arms traffic blockade. The Secretary of Stat$,however, has already cavilled at the expense of the proposed temporary installation, and it is considered that to tack Koweit on to the scheme,largely adding to the estimates,might wreck the temporary scheme altogether, ^oweit, as you know, is one of the places in the Gulf at which it is proposed some day to erect a permanent t wireless installation; for the present, consideration of this larger scheme is held up until the financial position improves. We shall take up the question again in the Autumn, and meanwhile we can only wait on, and hope that we shall be able, before very long,to make some progress. You will no doubt continue to keep us informed of Turkish intrigues with ^oweit. . To Yours very truly, Sd/ K.H.S.Clarke.

Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Special Assistant s endorsement No. 584, dated the 20th March 191 q,- requesting my views with res pect to (a) the site for, {b) the form of communication to be made to Shaikh Mubarak regarding the proposed wireless installation at Kuwait. 2. With regard to the site, in my opinion there is no question but that a site within the boundaries of our Bandar Shwaikh ground is by far the most advant ageous. There is ample space available, and a particularly suitable spot for both station and quarters exists within 600 yards to the east of the Shaikh s coal-shed ; if located here no questions of further lease or purchase are involved and con nection with the present Agency by telephone should present no serious difficulty. 3. With regard to the form of communication which it would be desirable to make to Shaikh Mubarak on the subject, ! am of opinion that none is required at present, nor indeed until it has been decided to commence the actual wor o construction and the material is on the way. When work is about to be^ com menced I would suggest that I should inform the Shaikh verbally in t e ordinary course of conversation that Government had at last decided to open a wireless station at Kuwait, thus giving the port the telegraphic communication with the world which has so long been desirable and that the site selected tor it lies within the limits of our concession at Bandar Shwaikh. My reasons tor these suggestions are (1) that the Shaikh has himself frequently expressed the advantage tele- graphic communication would be^to the town and his own readi ness to welcome its consummation {vide Kuwait letter No. C-29, dated the 25th May 1910). In later conversations he has fre quently gone further and, without actually asking for a telegraph station, has made it abundantly clear that he would welcome one for its utility and as a sign further assuring his close relations with the British Government; (2) that too early disclosure of the proposal would give rise to undesirable speculation and garbled accounts would certainly reach Turkish ears and probably initiate an anti-British press campaign inveigh ing against English aggression on so-called d urkish territory ; that a formal written communication would be likely to give the Shaikh an impression that some dark political move in connection with the Baghdad Railway was being played and so focus upon the proposal quite unnecessary attention ; ( 3 )2 (4) that we are at liberty to instal what we please within the limits of our concession. If it is considered desirable or essential to give the Shaikh an early or much anterior intimation of the project, which with all deference I deprecate, I would suggest that I should inform him verbally merely as a piece of general news that Government are contemplating a telegraphic installation in Kuwait and hope it will benefit the commercial prosperity of the town as well as render our relations with the Shaikh still closer. 4. It will be seen I have assumed above that the station would be open to accept public, private and commercial work and not be restricted solely to official business ; an assurance to that effect would, I feel sure, remove any possible objections that the Shaikh might be inclined to advance against a purely official installation, though I do not anticipate any if he is informed only on the eve of commencement of the construction work.

My visit is in connection with the proposed Wireless Buildings. The question of a site having been decided, I am to 'collect all the information necessary regarding foundations, suitable material for construction, cost of same, labour available &amp;c. to enable detailed plans and estimates to be prepared'. If the site is confined, it will be necessary to survey it. For this 3 khalassis are needed. A hole should be dug to see what the foundations are like. It should go down till something suitable is reached. The local practice as regards foundatloas will probably be deep enough. Could you arrange to have such a hole dug? Could you also collect any information for me as to v A * the prices of stone, gutch, sand, earth, labour, coolies, masons, carpenters ic.

I understand that the question of the wireless station at Abadan has been finally settled by the aband onment of the project in favour of land connection with Basrah via Muhammareh. The set of wireless now lying there is thus set free for use elsewhere and could be installed as soon as station at Oil Fields has been erected. I suggest that it should be erected at Bahrain&gt; as that is the Gulf port where the need for telegraphic communication is most keenly felt, especially by shipping and pearling interests. Under the altered conditions# the case of Kuwait is not so pressing, fhlitically and commercially a land line via Zobeir to Basrah would probably be more satis factory and reliable and messages for wireless system would then connect with wireless at Basrah.

To Tlie Honourable the Polltloal F^esident in the Persian GuIjT, Buahlre. j Dated Kuwait,, the 7th July, 1915.. Fir I have tne honour to report recent events in oonneo- -tioni with the installation of a telegraph station in Kuwait. 2. On 27th May-„ a Mr Anderson,, supervisor P.W.D.,, arrived here with six men,, etnd by the same ship came a letter from, the Asst: Engineer at Bushire,, saying that he was sending a party over tc commence the collection of materials for wireless buildings. 3.. Inferring from telegram from the Government of India, in the Foreign Department to your address do 469s dated 7th May last that a decision regarding the nature of the installation des- -tined for Kuwait had not yet been, reached, I telegraphed to you via Fao for instructions, sending a copy of my message to Bushire:. and instructed Mr Anderson mo confine himself for the time being, to making enquiries and such arrangements as would facilitate trie prompt collection of materials later. 4. On 18th June Mr Ai-tken the Asst:. Engineer himself arrived from Bahrain and with him some sixty masons and workmen; from Karachi„ and havingreoeived no reply to my telegram of 37th May I took advantage of the presence of tie mail steamer with her wireless installation to communicate with Major Trevor. From his reply,, Ho 595 dated 13th June (copy attached), which I re- -oeived on 22nd idem he had evidently neither received his copy of ay communication of 27th May nor seen the telegram from the Foreign Department referred to above. I therefore sent him oo- -pias by the mail of the 25th June. 5. Meanwhile, having first inspected the site selected by ;ayjjJJ' lot- ^redeoe r i3or and approved by th ale graph Department ,'^in. oom- -pany- with H.S.the ^haiid],, I permitted Mr Aitken to proceed with the collection of materialB and later with foundation, work:, and, in. the continued abaenoe of instructions, have since thoght, it best in all the oircumntances lo give lie Anderson a free hand to push on the building also,, a. course which I trust will meet with your approval. Mr Aiticeu returned to Bushire by the mail of the 2nd inst. Ur Anderson and his men are enoamp- -ed on. the site. 6.. It ray be observed that a., wireless InHtallationi in Kuwait has one special advantage. It will be possible for the mail steamers, almost all of which are now supplied with wireless, to give intimation of their approaolr to the port and desire to clear with despatch a very short time before their- arrival,and thus enable mails to be closed and lighters put out whereby time will be saved and the danger of cargo being ovcr.oarrLed reduced. This will be a great convenience in rough weather, of which the Kuwait harbour sees so much from May to September. 7. A copy of tlxis letter is being sent to Basrah.

The Honourable the Political Reeident in the Persian Gulf, Buehlre. Bated Kuwait, Deoe&amp;ber 17th, i ■ 1&amp;• Sir, I have the honour to refer to the subject of telegraph ic eoc^unication with Kuwait. £. On the loth November Vr Harrison, Officiating Birector Gener al of Posta ?m&amp; Telegraph© in India, visited this ort. He in^f formed ne that the proposal to ^rect a land line from Kuwait to Basrah was again under consideration; and at his suggestion we called upon the late Shaikh and asked for his views regarding t he safety or otherwise of the line from Interference or attack 3. Sir Mubarak replied that he would not advocate the erection of a land line at present as there was still general unrest a- taong the tribea, and that he could not guarantee security for the line until Baghdad had fallen Into our hands. He added that when tills event had taken place it ml^it be possible, as the effect would be, in his opinion, to Increase general respect for us a- Bong the Arabs to such an extent as to make the matter of guard ing the line a much easier one. 4. Sir Mubarak has since passed away, and I do not now feel able to recormend the erctlon of a land line* Hia powerful personali ty has been removed, and although Shaikh J&amp;bir promises to be a worthy successor he has not yet the Influence of his father a- mms, Uie Bedouin, and is not likely to have for some considerable time at least. Meen^.ile i think it would not bo fair to put u - on him the onus of guarding the line. 5. I therefore beg to reoomaead tiiat Uie wireless installation cay be cospleted, and would res. eotfally urge the Aivisabilityno) /i / of its completion ^ith ;11 possible despatch in view of the increasing necessity of obtaining early and reliable infor- mation. 0.

Copy to Political Agent, Koweit, for favour of remarks and suggestions. If you could spare a room on the ground floor of the Agency or build a room for the Telegraph Office, it would seem to be the most convenient arrangement. The two signallers could no doubt be found quarters outside. The present telegraph connection to Koweit being a Force measure, the cost^could no doubt be arranged for as such without any need for reference to Govt. • Memo.

Signals and Telegraphs to Chief Political Officer. From information received, it is expected that the construction of the Basra-Koweit Telegraph Line will shortly be sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India. 2. On sanction being accorded the construction will be commenced at once. 3. Will you kindly inform me whether you wish the line to follow any particular route. 4. Will any other offices be required on the Line such as Umm Qasr? If so, I suggest that they should all be combined Post and Telegraph Offices. 5. I understand that the buildings which have been built for the Wireless Station at Koweit are some two miles from the residence of the British Political Officer and will not therefore be used as a Telegraph Office. It seems advisable to make the Koweit Office a com bined Post &amp; Telegraph one. Would you kindly inform me if the Telegraph Office can be accommodated in the building now used as a Post Office there.I I* J\ # No. C.1G. Political Agency, Koweit• To The Chief Political Officer. Memorandum. t Please refer to your Memo. No. 1653, dated 9th March 1916. My remarks on the telegraph question are as follows (l) I will arrange for a suitable place for a telegraph office on the ground floor of the Agency; either in any existing room or if that is not possible by building one for the purpose. The signallers will be accommodated outside as you suggest. (2) I am of opinion that the Umm Qasr line will be far the better. It is easier to guard than the more direct route between Zobeir and Koweit and I think is much less likely to be attacked, certainly by raiding parties. Basrah, 12th March 1916. Sd. W. G.

The question of the location of Koweit Office may I think be regarded as disposed of thereby. As regards the alignment I concur with Colonel Grey in thinking that the Urn Kasr (ana not the ‘S^afwan) route should be fallowed ana that the line should be taken as near to the shores of the Khors Zobair and S^l^tyah as practicable, as it will thus be well away from caravan route and more accessible, for repair purpose^ by water. Without further enquiry and consultation with tne Shaikh of Koweit,! find it difficult to suggest at what particular point the line should leave the Khor S^bfiyah and cross over towards Jahrah: but I am asking the Political Agent to consult the Shaikh and let me have the result. It will probably be convenient in our own interests to keep an office and a signaller at Um Kasr in comeotion with Military communications, but apart from that consideration there seems no political need for an office anywhereanywhere between Zubair and Koweit.

Mr M’Craken has arrived, having traversed the country in question from UMK QASR to JAHRAH. He thinks that the line could conveniently leave the KHOR SABIXAH near TARFAWI, and proceed through a pass in the hills west of MURGHATTI, whence it would take a course at a distance of about a mile inland along the high ground which skirts the bay. Mr M'Craken is of opinion that on account of danger from floods the line should not be at a less distance than one mile from the shore, either between UMM QASR and TARFAWI,or between MURGHATTI and JAHRAH. 2. It is not thought here now that : ermanent guarding of the line will be necessary. Political Agent, KuwaitHo C 4&amp; of 1016• Political Atf;©ncy, Kuwait, Hay list , 1016. //?.

I sent you a spare copy of the map of the Koweit Hinterland with my d/o of the 12th and requested the skipper of the 'Elephanta' to hand these over to you on his arrival at ^asra. I hope you received them. I am now sending you ( 1 ) a list of wells be- -tween Urn Kasr and Sabiyah which more or less cor- -responds with the map and (2) Extracts from the diary of Major (now Col)Knox who accompanied the survay party which made the map in the winter of 1904-5. Shakespeare did not make this journey!- - as it had been carefully surveyed he did not check it, as he seems to have checked most routes. My enquiries regarding the quantity and quality of the water in the wells lead me to the conclusion that the only really good supplies of water are in the wells of Um Kasr, Jahra, Hajaijah and Kashaniyah (which is a i^it off the road) . I am given opposite opinions by different people e.g. Shaikh ^abir says there is plenty of water at every stage of the route and quite potable. Others say and I believe the pessimists, that especmally at this time oi t-he year water is scarce and brackish. I think the party will find the water scarcely potable except at those places i have mentioned. They had better take a plentiful supply on camels and if they March along the coast, have a water boat moving with them in pgggpve *of course if there are good autumn rains the water may be expected to improve. I would suggest your asking Col. Knox in Basra and remembering at the same time tham he did the journey at the dnd of December when the water sp- —rings would have been fresher than at this season ^ afterafter a long drought. ^— I should v. much like uo go out myself to Jahra and enquire but f that is quite impossible with the number of v^ws one has in the fire at present. A list of landing stages will be sent as soon as possible, but it would be best to rely on a pilot (whom I old. engage here) to aooom- -pany the party.

Sir Geoffrey Clarke, C.S.I., O.B.E., late Director-General, Posts and Telegraphs Government of India, in the Chair). The Chairman, in introducing the lecturer, said Mr. Maurice Simpson, the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, was giving a lecture on the subject of his own Department, with which he was naturally very familiar. The question of telegraphy was very much before the public at present ; the newspapers were full of discussions as to the merits and demerits of both wireless and wire telegraphy, and though this was rather outside the immediate subject of the paper, it was a question so important that it could not altogether be kept outside the discussion. The Indo-European Telegraph Department had carried on for about 70 years the most remarkable work in Persia, and the fact that it had overcome extraordinary physical and political difficulties, and had worked in the most perfect sympathy with the Persian Government, was one of the greatest possible tributes to its organisation and efficiency. The following paper was then read :— THE INDO-EUROPEAN TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT. By Maurice G. Simpson, M.I.E.E., Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Indo-European Telegraph Department is a department of the Govern ment of India about which very little is generally known, the reason being partly because its executive operations are almost entirely outside India, in the Persian Gulf and Persia, and partly because it is in the anomalous position of being the only Department of the Government of India with its headquarters in London and administered directly by the Secretary of State for India. How this anomalous position arose, the necessity for its continuance and the admin istrative difficulties it involves will, I hope, be made clear as we proceed. Telegraph lines began to be built in 1840 in England, and in 1852 in India, and in both countries they very rapidly extended. There were early visions of a telegraphic connection between England and India, but it is not till 1856 that we find the first mention of negotiations between England and Turkey for the construction for this purpose of a line eastward from Constantinople towards the Persian Gulf. The European and Indian Junction Telegraph Company were then endeavouring to obtain a concession in Constantinople for the construction of a land line to Kurna at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. In 1857 the grant of this concession was definitely refused by the Turkish Government, who undertook themselves to construct the line, but expressed a willingnessRAILWAVS to employ British engineers in carrying out the operation. In pursuance of the scheme the Turkish Government applied for and obtained the services of Lieut.-Col. Biddulph, of the Royal Artillery, who, after prehminary arrange ments, was able to commence the actual work of erection in August, 1859. He, however, finding work under the Ottoman administration presented too many difficulties, retired from the project the following year, but left behind him a Mr. Carthew and two brothers named MacCallum, all three retired non-com missioned officers of Artillery, to carry on the construction, which they did in the face of innumerable difficulties, with the result that the whole line from Constantinople to Baghdad was completed in 1861. The question then arose whether the route thence to the eastward should be direct to the head of the Persian Gulf, on which section interference by the Arab tribes was to be feared, or should be via the Persian frontier at Khanikin to Teheran and thence via Ispahan and Shiraz to Bushire. Eventually Turkey was persuaded to construct both routes and in 1863 work was commenced, the line from Baghdad to Khanikin being completed in October, 1864, and that to Fao in January, 1865. In the meantime there had been considerable activity on the Indian side. During the year 1861 the Government of India instructed Colonel Patrick Stewart, a brilliant young officer of the Royal Engineers and the pioneer of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, to make a survey of the Mekhran coast and of the Persian Gulf. In the following year he was able to lay before the Secretary of State a definite scheme, in which he recommended that a land line should be constructed from Karachi westward as far as Gwadur, and that a series of cables should be laid thence to Fao at the head of the Persian Gulf. He very shortly afterwards added a recommendation that the cables should be extended from Gwadur to Karachi, thus duplicating communication over this section where, it was feared, the cable might be exposed to damage from the heavy seas of the south-west monsoon. It is difficult now to realise the boldness of these proposals at a time when confidence in submarine cables had been badly shaken by the failure two years before of a cable laid in the Red Sea as part of a cable route to India, but it was beheved that the causes of the failure were well understood and could be avoided, and Col. Stewart’s project received the support of the most eminent electricians of the day, among whom was Prof. William Thomson, afterwards Lord Kelvin. The scheme was approved and Col. Stewart was ordered to carry it out. The cable was manufactured at Messrs. Henley’s Telegraph Works at Woolwich, and its manufacture and submersion was under the control of Messrs. Bright and Clark, well-known telegraph engineers. It was sent out in five sailing ships to Bombay, whence the ships were towed by steamers of the Indian Navy to Karachi and up the Gulf and the cables were laid in the sea without any serious accident. The section Gwadur to Mussendom was com pleted in February, Mussendom to Bushire in March, Bushire to Fao in April 1 1l( VXT and Gwadur to Karachi in May, 1864, thus completing the connection between Karachi and Fao in readiness for the Turkish line on to Constantinople, which was completed some months later in January, 1865. Before this Mr. Walton of the Indian Telegraph Department had been deputed to construct the land line from Karachi to Gwadur ; he commenced the work in June, 1862, and completed it the following April. In constructing this 400 miles of line Mr. Walton encountered very great hindrances, not only because of the utterly barren and inhospitable nature of the country with the consequent lack of water and difficulties of transport, but also from the jealousies, bickerings and opposition of the local petty Chiefs, and that he was able to construct it at all is a testimony to Mr. Walton’s perseverance and ability. It has been stated above that the Turkish line from Baghdad to Khanikin on the Persian frontier was completed in October, 1864. The line from Khanikin to Teheran and thence south to Bushirewas constructed on behalf of Persia by British Engineers under Major Champain, an officer of the Royal Engineers; it was commenced in 1863 and was completed in October, 1864, but the line was so continuously interrupted that it was never really opened, and in fact, the Baghdad to Teheran section has never been used for international telegraph traffic with India. The first telegraphic communication between Europe and India was effected on the completion of the Baghdad Fao section of the Turkish line on January 27th, 1865, just 63 years ago. It is pathetic to recall that Col. Patrick Stewart, to whose energy, perseverance and remarkable abilities the success of the project was mainly due, died at the early age of 33, in Constantinople, on the 16th January, 1865, a few days only before the completion of the connection between Europe and India for which he had worked so strenuously. In the month after the opening the number of messages exchanged was 62 only, but this number quickly increased, and in the December following 2,365 messages were exchanged, the charge for a telegram being £5 for 20 words or part of 20 words, while the average time of transit was 6 days 8 hours and 44 minutes. At this time a letter to Bombay took just over a month on the way, being carried by sea to Alexandria, across Egypt to Suez, and thence by sea to Bombay. In the same year efforts were made to transmit messages via the Russian lines, which had been extended through Tiflis to Teheran, but the service was found to be most indifferent, the average time of transit being 17 days 5 hours and 5 minutes, while messages were so badly mutilated as to be unintelligible. The delays to messages between England and India was the subject of communications, including telegraphs,” sat and took evidence in 1866, and various proposals were made for the improvement of the telegraph service ; alternative schemes were submitted and diplomatic representations made, butthe difficulty was first solved by Messrs. Siemens and Company who offered to construct an independent double line of telegraph from London to Teheran, provided that Her Majesty’s Government gave them adequate support. They received this support, and Messrs. Siemens of London and Messrs. Siemens and Halske of Berlin were able to obtain the necessary concessions from Germany, Russia and Persia. An English company called the Indo-European Telegraph Company was formed to take over the concessions and w r ork them, with the result that the combined Indo-European route, with the section London to leheran worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Company, and the further section 7 eheran to Karachi via Bushire worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India, was opened for traffic on January 31st, 1870. I he average speed of messages was immediately increased, and w r e find in the year 1871 the average transit time by the Turkish route was 1 day 6 hours and 20 minutes and by the Indo route only 6 hours and 7 minutes. When the Indo Company’s line from England to Teheran appeared likely to mature it was anticipated that the new telegraph route to India would be largely patronised by the public, and that a line worked by English telegraph clerks throughout would, by greatly reducing delays and errors, cause a corres ponding increase in the number of messages fomarded. To meet this expected increase in traffic it was necessary to duplicate the line from Teheran to Karachi. Up to this time the departmental system consisted of one international ware from Teheran to Bushire, one cable from Bushire to Gwadur, and one cable and one land line from Gwadur to Karachi. After much negotiation wath Persia and the local Chiefs the land line was extended from Gwadur to Jask in 1869, and in the same year a new cable was laid from Jask to Bushire, the first cable having in the previous year been moved from Mussendom to Jask for climatic reasons. It was not however found possible to add another wire for international use on the section Teheran to Bushire until the year 1874. Thus, when the Indo route was opened for traffic in January, 1870, there w^ere two wires from London to 1 eheran, a single wire Teheran to Bushire and a duplicate line of cables and land lines thence to Karachi. In the meantime submarine telegraphy had made enormous strides, thanks chiefly to the genius of Lord Kelvin and the far-seeing enterprise of its com mercial pioneers, amongst the foremost of whom was the late Sir John Pender. Under his auspices the British-Indian Submarine Telegraph Company, soon afterwards knowm as the Eastern Telegraph Company, completed a cable route from England to Bombay in 1870, a few r months only after the completion of the Indo overland route. Thus, in 1871 the three telegraph routes between England and India, the Turkish via Constantinople, the Indo-European via Germany, Russia and Persia, and the Eastern cable route to Bombay, were all in operation, and so- continued, with of course occasional interruptions to the one or the other, till, the outbreak of war in 1914.i in n We must now turn to the agreements which have been made with Persia under which the Department has erected and worked its telegraph lines in that land. The first convention was made in 1863, and by it the idea of the British erecting and working a line in Persia was entirely set aside. On the other hand Persia undertook, on our providing the material at Persia’s expense, to make and work a line for herself from Khanikin to Bushire and to allow us, at a tariff to be fixed aftenvards, to transmit our Indian messages by its means. The only intervention on our part provided for by the convention was the presence of one English officer for a limited period in Persia to advise as to the best method of construction. Unpromising as such a convention was, it was decided to take action on it in the hope that something more practical might be evolved. Major Murdoch Smith of the Royal Engineers, with a staff of three officers and twelve non-commissioned officers of the same corps and six civilians, was sent out to construct the line. Their arrival in the country was not unnaturally viewed with the very strongest suspicion, and the whole country from the Shall downwards regarded them as most unwelcome guests. It would be an endless undertaking to attempt to describe the difficulties by which their task was surrounded. Success often seemed well-nigh hopeless, but, thanks to the tact and the zealous and loyal efforts of the widely-scattered staff, suspicion gradually gave way to trust and enmity to friendship. The position, which was a very unsatisfactory one, was much improved by a convention made in 1865, under which a second wire was to be erected, the materials being provided as before at the cost of Persia, but now the erection was to be in charge of a British engineer and staff paid for from British funds. It was also stipulated that a British staff should be engaged to organise the working of the line and to give instructions to the Persians in telegraphy. At the end of five years this British staff was to be withdrawn and the line handed over to Persia. The second wire was to be used solely for international messages sent in European language. It was under this convention that the Department was working the Bushire -1 eheran line when the Indo route was opened in 1870, but the single international wire which it contemplated was soon found to be inadequate to cope with the traffic and a further convention was entered into in 1872 for the erection of another wire. This latter convention was to remain in force up to 1895, but it has been from time to time extended, and, as now agreed, it will remain in force up to 1st January, 1945- Under it the line from Teheran to Bushire which was erected partly at the cost of Persia who paid for the material and partly at the cost of India who paid the salaries of the British establishment and other expenses, was to be maintained wholly at the charge of British or rather Indian revenues. One wire is given over entirely to Persia for working local traffic, that is, messages originating in one station in Persia and terminating .at another, the two remaining wires being worked by the Department for inter national traffic. A certain amount of local traffic is also carried on these two international wires, but the revenue derived from it is handed over to Persia. r9 Receipts for international traffic originating or terminating in Persia are shared between Persia and the Department, Persia receiving the larger share, while for international messages passing through Persia a fixed royalty is paid to the Persian Government. For a comparatively small initial outlay, therefore^ Persia is in possession of an efficient telegraph line just over 700 miles in length, maintained entirely free of expense to her and from which she derives all the revenue accruing from local traffic and a very considerable share of the revenue from international traffic. On the other hand India has, so long as the convention lasts, control of an essential link in the Indo route from England to India. I he (iwadur-Jask line which runs through Persian territory was erected under a convention concluded in 1868 permitting the British Government to erect and work the line at their own expense in return for an annual payment of 1 omans 3,000, equal to-day to about £600. This convention will also expire on January 1st, 1945. 1 elegraphic communication between the British Minister at Teheran and the Consul General at Mashad is afforded by the Persian line between those two places, but it proved so inefficient that in 1885 by agreement with the Shah the maintenance of the line was undertaken by the Department. India agreed to contribute Rs. 20,000 a year towards the cost of maintenance, but this sum, together with such sums as Persia contributed, was quite inadequate to do^ more than patch up the line, which w’as in a deplorable condition. In 1892 special grants were made by Persia and India and the late Mr. King-Wood was deputed to put the line in order, since which time it has proved efficient. The cost of maintenance is shared between Persian and Indian revenues. The line is worked by the Persians but the Department has the use of it for a short time daily for the transmission of state telegrams. The line from Mashad south to Seistan was before the war under the control of Russia. 1 owards the end of the century the increase of traffic pointed to the need of an alternative line between Teheran and Karachi, and after considerable negotiation a convention was signed with Persia in 1901 for the construction of a three wire line from Teheran through Yazd and Kerman to the Perso-Baluch frontier at Hurmak, to meet there a line constructed by the Indian Telegraph Department from Quetta. The line, which was constructed by the late Mr. King-Wood, was completed in 1907, and, a branch line from Nok Kundi on the Hurmak-Quetta line having also been completed to Karachi the same year, the desired alternative route became available for traffic. By the terms of the convention this Central Persia line was constructed by the Department, the Government of India treating the cost as an advance to Persia. One wire is made over to Persia for local traffic and the other two are worked by the Department, mainly for international traffic. As in the case of the Teheran-Bushire line Persia receives all the receipts accruing from local traffic and a major share of the terminal rate on international traffic originatingin f 11 •or terminating in Persia, but has leased the revenue from international transit messages to the Department in exchange for an annual rental of 4% of the capital cost of the line. Thus Persia obtained without any cost to herself a thoroughly good telegraph line almost 800 miles in length, passing right through the centre of her country, one wire of which is entirely for her own use for local internal traffic. There was one further work undertaken by the Department in Persia before the war, and that was the reconstruction of the lines in Arabistan; the lines running westwards from Bushire to Mohammerah, Shuster and Dizful. These lines had fallen into such disrepair as to be practically unworkable, and an agreement was made in 1913 under which the British Government advanced the money needed for their complete reconstruction, in return for which Persia agreed to a renewal up to 1st January, 1945, of {a) the convention of 1868 for the Gwadur-Jask line, (b) the convention of 1872 for the Teheran-Bushire line, and (c) the convention of 1901 for the Central Persia line. Let us now turn to a consideration of the administration of the Department. Its first head was Col. Patrick Stewart, who seems to have had no fixed head quarters, but to have spent his time in the Persian Gulf, in Persia and Constan tinople, with visits to India and London. He was nominally under the Govern ment of Bombay, whence he derived his funds, but he appears to have corres ponded direct with the Secretary of State and the Government of India impartially. On his death in January, 1865, Major Champain, who, it will be remembered, was in charge of the operations in Persia, was nominated by the Secretary of State to perform the duties of Director-in-Chief. Col. Goldsmid of the Madras Staff Corps, however, who had previously been engaged on the inspection of the lines in Turkish territory and was with Col. Stewart in Con stantinople when the latter died, also received orders, apparently from the Government of India, to consummate the Col. Stewart’s work. The confusion lasted about six months, when Col. Goldsmid was definitely appointed Director- in-Chief with Major Champain as his assistant. I here was an office in London where the general administration was conducted, an office in Constantinople under a Commissioner, while the Persian and Persian Gulf sections were under Directors with headquarters at Teheran and Karachi respectively, the whole being under the Government of Bombay. Remembering the difficulties in communications in those days, the organisation of such a scattered department must have been an onerous task, and it was lurther complicated by the many delicate questions which arose both at Con stantinople and Teheran requiring diplomatic action. Col. Goldsmid was for over on the move from London to Bombay, Karachi, Teheran and Constanti nople as circumstances required, but by 1870 he felt that the position had become sufficiently stabilised to enable him to recommend the abolition of the appointment of Assistant Director-in-Chief, proposing that he himself should retire and Major Champain should become Director-in-Chief, which was agreedto. Very soon after Champain’s appointment the question of his headquarters arose, the Government of India proposing that these should be at Bombay. Major Champain, however, vigorously opposed this proposal; he pointed out that the interests of the line were intimately bound up with those of the Indo- European Telegraph Company, in conjunction with whom our traffic was carried, that he had constantly to consider questions that affected the Company and the Department alike, and that he had much correspondence with other telegraph administrations which could not be conducted from India without serious inconvenience and loss of time. He also referred to the difficult ques tions which arose with Persia in relation to our treaties, which had to be dealt with in communication with the Foreign Office. The principal traffic office must necessarily be in London, where cash was received for every message sent to India and the accounts made out for the shares due to other administrations. These arguments prevailed and the headquarters of the Department were fixed in London, but the control of the Department was shifted from the Government of Bombay to the Public Works Department of the Government of India. Sir John Bateman Champain, as he afterwards became, held charge of the Department till his death early in 1887, when he was succeeded by Col. Murdoch Smith, the Director of the Persian section. The question of the future adminis tration of the Department was again taken up, and although the arguments that Col. Champain had advanced in 1871 had lost none of their force they were now disregarded, and, in the hopes of effecting some small economy, it was decided to abolish the appointment of Director-in-Chief and transfer the Depart ment to the charge of the Director-General of the Indian Telegraph Department. This was carried out early in 1888 when Col. Murdoch Smith retired, but it did not prove successful. Col. Mallock, the Director-General of the Indian Telegraph Department, travelled over the whole system from Karachi to Teheran, and in 1890 submitted an exhaustive report to the Government of India, in which he strongly advocated the resuscitation of the appointment of Director-in-Chief in London. He pointed out that the addition of the Indo- European Department placed an intolerable burden on the Director-General in India, who had already a very large and responsible charge, and he showed the necessity for the head of the Indo-European Department to be in London, where he could be in close communication with the commercial cable companies with whom the interests of the Department were inextricably bound. His recom mendations were accepted, and in June, 1893, the control of the Department was transferred from the Government of India to the Secretary of State and Mr. Flinch, the director of the Persian Gulf section, was appointed Director- in-Chief with headquarters in. London. This organisation has continued down to the present time, Mr. Ffinch being followed by Sir Henry Kirk and Sir Rayner Barker, whom I had the honour of succeeding about three-and-a-half years ago. It is still the case that the successful working of the Departmentis dependent on close co-operation between the Director-in-Chief and the cable- companies in London and on the successful solution, through the Foreign office, of questions arising in relation to our agreements with Persia, and in my opinion the existing organisation is the most suitable to meet the peculiar conditions of the case. The Staff under the Director-in-Chief consists of the Directors of the Persian Gulf and Persian Sections with their headquarters at Karachi and Teheran respectively, 27 gazetted officers and 47 General Service Clerks approximately equally divided between the two sections, 115 Persian Gulf Signallers in the Gulf Section and 58 Persian Section Signallers in the Persian Section. The gazetted officers with one or two exceptions are entirely recruited by promotion from the grade of General Service Clerk. The latter have been recruited as telegraph clerks mainly from England, for, although the experiment was tried, it was found that the conditions in Persia were unsuitable for Anglo- Indians or Indians. The staff serving in Persia have been subjected to con ditions of existence very different from those affecting their colleagues in most other countries. Repairing the lines and keeping as close as possible on the heels of Afghan gun runners who were wrecking them, and this in midsummer in the desolate no man’s land near the Afghan frontier is no child’s play ; nor is rebuilding a mile of line completely washed away in the Lut desert. In such circumstances it is the case of one Englishman alone with a handful of Persian labourers, drinking brackish water till he can hardly swallow, eating anything that comes his way and sleeping on the ground. The safety of our offices and staff has in many cases undoubtedly been due to the reputation which by their own conduct our officers had established. Many of them have been robbed by brigands and left almost or quite naked to struggle to the nearest village, while others less fortunate have been murdered. The winter cold of the wind-swept plateaux is intense and so is the heat in summer in the lower lying plains and deserts. It is difficult to convey an idea of the amount of suffering and hardship that the staff have endured ; there is hardly a senior member who has not been through famines, epidemics, riots and other excitements in plenty. If life in the Gulf Section is not beset in the same way with alarms and excursions, it must not be forgotten that many of the staff in that Section serve in isolated coast stations and in desolate islands in what is perhaps one of the worst climates- in the world. I he staff have served the Government of India with unswerving loyalty in trying, difficult and not infrequently dangerous circumstances, and in regions so remote that, in the absence of any special incident, their steadv and valuable work is often in danger of passing unnoticed. The construction of the departmental telegraph system and the general organisation of the staff have now been considered, but these exist solely for the purpose of the efficient transmission of telegrams, and it is to this- aspect of the matter we must now turn. The Indo-European Telegraph Department had, so far as its lines extended, the monopoly of traffic between Europe and the East from the commencement of 1865 to the commencementof 1870, while the Turkish line was the only route available. 1 he tariff charged' for a telegram from England to India was £5 for 20 words or part of 20 words, but this was reduced in 1869 to £2 17s. od., and the average time of transmission was rather over 5 days. In spite of the monopoly and the high charges the Department only showed a small surplus of receipts over working expenses quite insufficient to pay the interest on the capital expenditure of £960,000 that had been incurred. When the Indo-European Telegraph Company in. 1870 opened their route to Teheran and the Eastern cable route to Bombay was also established the traffic was divided between the three routes, the charge by each being the same, viz., £2 17s. od. for 20 words. I here was not enough traffic to make any one of the three routes remunerative and the Indo- European and Eastern Companies gradually raised their rates till in 1871 the- charge was £4 10s. od. for 20 words, Turkey still working at the £2 17s. od. tariff. At this lower rate the Turkish route was able to attract a considerable proportion of the traffic in spite of working at a much lower speed, the average time for a message being about a day and a half as against 6 or 7 hours only by either of the other routes. The two companies then complained that their lines, paid for and maintained by private capital, were being undersold by a line which, supported by state revenues, continued to work at a dead loss. A Sub-Conference met at Berne, and the Turkish administration was induced to raise its rate also to £4 10s. od. At subsequent Telegraph Conferences it was arranged that the tariff by the Turkish route should always be slightly lower than that by the others, but the difference was never again sufficient to attract more than a very small percentage of the traffic. In 1876 the system of charging by the word was introduced, the charge from Europe to India being fixed at Frs. 5 50 per word via Teheran or Suez and Frs. 5 00 y i a Turkey, from time to time as the traffic increased and advances were made in the science the rates have been reduced and cheaper classes of messages introduced, so that it is. now possible to send what is called a ‘ Daily Letter Telegram’ of 20 words for the very modest rate of 4|d. a word. In 1878 the Eastern Telegraph Company, the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department entered into a working arrangement with a view to the avoidance of the serious fluctuations in receipts caused by the interruption of the one or the other route, and to the attainment of as high a stability of revenue as possible. This co-operation enabled certain other economies to be effected and placed the companies in a position to offer the public a greatly improved service. From this time onwards to the outbreak of the great war the Department carried a steadily increasing number of messages, thus Year. 1879-80 1889-90 1899- 00 1900- 10 No. of Messages. 42,487 106,702 152,837 274,092V T 14 ■ Ml At the outbreak of war in August, 1914, the Company’s lines through Europe were of course immediately put out of action, and it seemed at first that the Department would have little work to do. Sir Rayner Barker at once saw the danger of Russia being cut off from telegraphic communication with her allies by any of the direct routes to the west, and he realised that the roundabout route via Bombay, Karachi and Teheran might become of vital importance. There were already two routes available between Karachi and Teheran, via Bushire and via the Central Persia line, but a third could be made available via Mashad and Seistan by completing the link between Seistan and Hurmak. An agreement was quickly reached with Persia, who authorised the construction of the line in September, 1914, and it was completed the following month. This alternative line, of which it will be remembered the section Mashad to Seistan was worked by the Russians, proved of invaluable service, especially when enemy activity interrupted the Teheran-Bushire line. When Turkey entered the war and a campaign in Mesopotamia started it was clear that the single cable between Fao and Bushire was quite inadequate to meet telegraphic requirements. Fortunately a sufficient length of suitable ready-made cable was available in London, and this was purchased and sent out ; it escaped attack from the enemy’s submarines and was successfully laid in June, 1916. It was also found impossible to maintain the land line between Jask and Charbar, owing to the turbulence of the tribes in the interior, and a short length of cable was laid between these places. Thus the Department was able to provide two comparatively safe lines which carried the whole traffic between Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf ports and Persia on the one hand, and India, England and all parts of the world on the other. This traffic was extremely heavy, amounting in 1918-19 to 660,000 messages containing over seven million words, in addition to a very large number of messages relating to the sick and wounded which were carried free of charge. The traffic was carried without any serious breakdown or even undue delay, and the Department is, I think, justified in claiming to have rendered a very important service to the campaign in Mesopotamia. At the end of the war the Indo-European Telegraph Company at once took action to restore their line through Germany, Poland and Russia. A great deal of work was entailed in this restoration, but it was successfully accomplished, and the Indo route was once more established in August, 1923, having been interrupted exactly 9 years. The Department again resumed the work for which it mainly exists, the transmission, in conjunction with the Company, of messages between Great Britain and India and countries beyond. To this is now added the traffic with Iraq which before the war was transmitted via Constantinople, the total number of messages dealt with by the Department in the year ended 31st March last having been just under 400,000. I cannot conclude this account of the Department without some reference to the Beam wireless service recently opened with India, which has proved15 very successful and has attracted a considerable share of the available traffic. This new service has only been working for four months, and it is too early to say yet what the outcome may be, but I think it is probable that the cheap rates now available will so stimulate the telegraph habit that the volume of traffic will increase to dimensions which a few years ago would have been thought impossible, and that there will be ample work for all. DISCUSSION. The Chairman, in opening the discussion, said the meeting had listened with great pleasure to the lecturer’s most interesting account of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Mr. Simpson had referred to the manufacture of a cable in 1865 by Henley’s. The core of all cables, of course, consisted of a copper wire covered with a gutta-percha core, surrounded with sheathing wires, and the core of the 1865 cable was manufactured by the Gutta-percha Company, the oldest manufacturing company of cables in the world. That was now the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, of which he had the honour to be one of the managing directors. It was a very wonderful thing to have that enormous line consisting of the two systems of the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, going right across Europe and across Persia, through trackless deserts and very difficult country, and maintaining in ordinary times a very stable system of communication between Great Britain and India. During the war, undoubtedly, the system had been interrupted for a considerable period, but during that period, as had been pointed out by the lecturer, the Indo-European Telegraph Department had rendered invaluable services for British communications with Mesopotamia ; in fact, if it had not been for the telegraph system of the Department, it would have been almost impossible to carry on the campaign in Mesopotamia at all. It might be thought that with the splendid system of cables which existed in England and India, and the new beam wireless waves, there was hardly room to-day for a very long land line ; but he looked upon the Indo-European systems as a very important British asset. If those systems were to give up their great land lines, they would undoubtedly be taken over by one of the big European countries and probably worked in competition with the existing British cable system. He considered that the very existence of the Indo-European Company and the Department in Persia was of extreme importance to the British Empire. If those systems were to pass into any foreign hands it would, he thought, be very detrimental to British interests. The joint purse to which the lecturer had referred was a fine example of industrial association. It was very largely owing to the joint purse that the Indo-European Company and the Department were enabled to revive their systems so extra ordinarily well in 1923. During all that long period when their communications were interrupted, if it had not been for the joint purse the Indo-European Company would probably have disappeared, but owing to the joint purse they were able to restore their system, and were now working as well as ever. The lecturer had touched rather lightly on beam wireless. To all those who dealt with cables, beam wireless was rather a sore subject; but they were not afraid. Beam wireless was a most marvellous invention. It was not necessarily beam wireless, but short-wave wireless and it was a wonderful invention, and had proved very successful ; but it had very definite limitations. It was not by any means continuous ; almost every day on almost every circuit there were times ofi6 failure, and that, to anyone who had practical experience of a telegraph office, was a very serious matter. Another point about beam wireless was that it was not secret, and it could not be made secret. Anybody could tap it, and it was subject not only to atmospheric interference, but also to deliberate interference by other beam wireless stations. But it had a place, and an undoubted place, in the future, and with the reduction of tariffs we were arriving at a position in which the tele graph would be used very largely to replace the ordinary letter mail ; but when cable letters became cheap enough, he thought they would become the ordinary means of communication, and when that extended there would be ample room for both cables and wireless circuits throughout the world. One heard of the very high speed obtained on wireless circuits, but in telegraphy very high speed was often a nuisance unless it could be controlled. To get any single circuit pouring in 2,000 letters a minute was a most harassing matter, because it could not be dealt with ; and the importance of the new type of cable, known as the loaded cable, was that one could get the high speed if one wanted it, but one got something that was far more valuable, namely channels. The 2,000 words a minute was divided into channels, each working in a separate circuit, and this got through the traffic at a workable speed, which could be handled by four or five operators. That was better than having the office loaded up with self-recording messages, which would all have to be deciphered afterwards at hand speed, and could not possibly be handled by any single operator. Vice-Admiral H. W. Grant, C.B. (Joint Managing Director, Eastern Telegraph Company) said it was a great honour to him to be invited to speak on Mr. Simpson’s- lecture, and he would like to say a word or two about the Eastern Telegraph Com pany and its associated Companies. Many people did not know what the Eastern Company was, and he had taken the liberty of bringing a map which looked rather like an advertisement. All the red lines shown on the map were the Eastern Telegraph Company’s system. He wished to congratulate his friend Mr. Maurice Simpson on his excellent lecture. He had never been through the history of the Department before, and was very grateful to Mr. Simpson for his historical survey. It was often a great help in negotiations to realise what had happened in the past. He had only been connected with the Eastern Telegraph Company for about nine years, but it was a most absorbing business. The Company worked in close co-operation with the- Indo-European system. Every three months there was a meeting of the Indian Joint Purse Committee, consisting of the Eastern Telegraph Company, the Indo- European 1 elegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and the business never took more than half an hour. That showed how well a commercial company could work in co-operation with a Government Department. All those red lines shown on the map, going to all sorts of odd places, linked up a great part of the world. Mr. Simpson had referred to the speed of messages, which, at one time, was six days to India, and people were very pleased when it came down to six hours. To Bombay at the present time the Eastern Company was working—except for a short stretch at Suez, which was going to be altered to- underground land lines—without anybody touching the message from London right into Bombay. The button was pressed in London, and the message was in Bombay in a second. That was rather wonderful, and had been brought about by the ingenuity and splendid work of the staff of the Eastern Telegraph Company. I he Company had a keen staff, who were always looking out for something better. A few years ago he had been worried because they could not get the “ balances ,rr right The balances were always troublesome ; a section would get stopped for a few hours, but now the staff had been able to synchronise the speed of the cable all the way through by a system of relays. By means of this system of relays, as the message came into the station it was automatically shot through and given another boost on the line. Another important thing about it was that if there was an error in any signal it was corrected at the succeeding station, and went on correct; so that if it left London right it must get to Bombay correct. The time taken telegraphically was, of course, infinitesimal. One of the first sections dealt with in that way was the one between London and Cape Town, and one of the tests applied was to press a button in London, and arrange for a man at the Cape Town end to press another button when he saw the signal come through, and the reply had come back in i£ seconds. That was practically instantaneous, allowing for the time taken by the man to respond to the signal, which might take half a second. Before such an audience as that he was tempted to say a few words about the importance of an enterprise which perhaps was not quite fully appreciated. In the war it would have been impossible to carry on without the telegraphs. He had been at the Admiralty as Director of Operations, and the communications received by cable were a very big factor in winning the war. Once a submarine got in near Lisbon, and cut a cable. Another incident which came to his notice was when he had been in command of the fleet which was trying to hunt down the “ Emden.” The crew of the “ Emden ” had landed at Cocos and smashed up everything, but luckily the staff had buried all the spare instruments in the sand, and as soon as the enemy went away the staff dug them up and restored communication in a few hours. Then again in the Falkland Island the Pacific cable was cut. Unfortunately the staff, though they had buried the instruments in the sand, put up a placard in the office to say where they were, which was rather silly, and therefore the enemy knew exactly where to find them. The lecturer had mentioned the number of free messages that were carried. He might add that the Eastern Telegraph Company carried millions of words free for the soldiers of the Empire, and they were only too proud and thankful to be able to do it. Mr. H. L. M. Tritton (Chairman, Indo-European Telegraph Company, Ltd.,) said Mr. Simpson had truly remarked that his Department was not very much in the public eye, but for all that it, filled a role which was very important both from a strategic and from a commercial point of view. The lecturer had referred to the difficulties and dangers which were so successfully surmounted in the early days, and that audience could not but be struck by the indomitable courage of those pioneer officers of the Department. The foundations of that great undertaking were indeed well and truly laid, and the same spirit which animated those pioneers was very evident in their successors to-day. As Chairman of the Indo-European Telegraph Company he wished to emphasise the close working which existed between the Company and the Department, and also the Eastern Company, as Admiral Grant had just explained. As had already been pointed out, since 1870 the Indo-European Telegraph Company had worked in the closest co-operation with the Department, and, as a result, direct communication was obtained between London and Teheran and Teheran and Karachi, and he might add that for about the last twenty years instantaneous communication by means of the Company’s and the Department’s lines had been achieved over a distance of 5,300 miles between -1 I ■yr 7 * London and India. After the war, the company of which he had the honour to be Chairman was of course severely handicapped because their line was down in many places, but he was glad to think that the work of reconstruction was expeditiously and satisfactorily carried out under the Chief Engineer of the Company, Captain Cook, and it was again open for through traffic in August, 1923. To touch on a personal note, he might mention that his father had been a director of the Indo-European Telegraph Company since- its inception, and for many years before 1923 had been its Chairman. Although he (the speaker) was a comparative newcomer to the telegraph world, he very much shared the view expressed by the lecturer in the last paragraph of his most interesting paper, that w'e were on the threshold of great developments and largely increased traffic, and these would, in his opinion, more than fill the different methods of transmission which existed to-day. C Lieut.-Colonel Sir Arnold T. Wilson, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., C.M.G., D.S.O., remarked that after listening to Mr. Simpson’s description of the arrangements of the Indo-European telegraph system, his audience would have come to the conclusion that the Athanasian Creed was a simple formula compared to the Department’s arrangements, with its works in one country, its administration in another, and its headquarters in a third ; itself a Government department it relied for its communica tions with the United Kingdom by land on the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which at all events before the war was under Russian protection, though its Chair man was invariably a British subject with his headquarters in London. Financial stability was ensured by the device of a joint purse which it shared with at least one other company, and by half-hour conferences every three months—at which, he hoped, the interests of the public were as carefully safeguarded as those of the companies appeared to have been ! It was an interesting, but clearly an exceedingly complicated, state of affairs. Not much had been said about the Persian Government in the matter, except as the recipients of considerable revenue. The Persian Government was one of the first to enter the International Postal Union. They were also one of the first Governments to adhere to the International Telegraph Conventions, which they could scarcely have done had not the Indo-European Telegraph Department been at their disposal to enable them to carry out the rather complicated arrangements ancillary to international conventions. They had had, ever since the ’seventies, a thoroughly sound system of telegraph communication provided partly by the Company and partly by the Department, covering, as the map showed, all the principal centres of Persia, and which had been of inestimable value. Had those lines been owned and controlled by the Persian Government in early days, they would have been treated perhaps with less respect by the local residents. He had been in Persia for about 20 years and he believed he knew personally between 1907 and 1920 at least half the general service clerks and the superint endents of the Department, both in the Persian Gulf and in Persia, and he was glad to have the opportunity of expressing his admiration and respect for them. There was no more efficient Government Department in India or out of India. He had known I.E.T.D. men at Muscat, at Charbar, at Jask, at Henjam, at Bushire, at Bahrein and at hao, and all up the line from Bushire to Teheran. They had always been helpful and cheerful. By the courtesy of Reuter’s Agency and of the Department British Consular officials received Reuter’s News free every day, and were not ungrateful to the Staff on whom fell the burden of receiving and transcribing the often lengthy summaries of English weather and English footballresults. He had visited practically every' land station shown on the map, and he could never be sufficiently grateful for the generous hospitality he had received from the superintendents and their wives. Nor could he refrain from mentioning the Persian linesmen on whose shoulders the welfare of the lines had rested since they were first started ; and they were very near to his heart and half a dozen of them had been friends of his for the past twenty years. They were a very loyal lot of men, loyal alike to their own Government and to the Department who paid. them. They had been attacked numberless times by brigands, and his recollection of the treatment of their claims was that they were not always treated so liberally by the Department as they should have been. He did not fbink there was any other parallel for a Department of a foreign Government, such as the Government of India or the Indian Office, controlling two or three thousand miles of land line in a foreign country with its own staff, and yet maintaining perfectly harmonious relations over a period of 50 years with the national government, in this case the Persian Government, and at the end of that 50 years getting a renewal of their concession for another 20 years—the best possible proof, if any proof was needed, of the ability with which the Department had been administered. When the Conventions were last renewed the Persian Government did not appear to have attempted to strike a hard bargain, but to have been well content to have the services of the Indo-European Department for a further period of 20 years. That reflected very high credit not only on the administration in England, but on the tact and discretion which must have characterised the action of the staff at all the various centres on the spot, each one of them a centre of intrigue at one time or another ; the Telegraph Office at each place had contrived in times of difficulty to remain friendly with and indispensable to the party which was in power without antagonising the party which was outside the gates and ready to cut the telegraph lines. The light-hearted nomad marksmen had always been a difficulty : insulators were an irresistible target : the white porcelain variety were found to offer such temptations to young marksmen that brown had been substituted in the hope that the duller colour would reduce their losses, but with moderate success and later on on certain stretches insulators were devised of cast-iron, with a porcelain insulator inside. Even that, however, had proved insufficient ; the riflemen had got underneath and shot upwards ! The posts too were invaluable rubbing posts for mangy camels, and made serviceable tent-poles and roof-bearers ! Residents in Persia and the Persian Gulf had every reason to be thoroughly satisfied with the speed and accuracy of the services at present existing. He could entirely confirm what Admiral Grant had said as to the immense value of the cables during the war to the Navy and to the British Army. During the war in Mesopotamia they were absolutely indispensable ; and the Department had rendered great services. The staff in all offices was heavily drawn on for war purposes, which meant that those who were left had to do twice as much work as they did before, and as they had always had a full day’s work it had been extremely hard on those who remained, without extra pay, or the stimulus of war service, and he would like to place on record his appreciation not only of those who joined up, but of those who had to remain behind. He could not speak about telegraphic rates. That matter had been dealt with fairly fully by the lecturer, but he thought there was still room for improvement from the point of view of the public. Although the remark he was about to make was not strictly germane to the subject, as several representatives of telegraphic interests were present, he desired to express the hope that the next internationalV’ H \ ; 20 'Conference would be induced to dispense with the bugbear of the pronounceable word. He suggested that the international conferences were still dominated by the tradition of the longhand telegraphist, painfully taking down a group which he caught up by ear and recorded, whereas today practically all recording and despatching was done automatically. Any such relaxation of arbitrary rules would help to increase the purely commercial traffic and perhaps the friendly D.L.T’S would follow. He wished Mr. Simpson would write a book. He himself had a shelf a long as his arm of books about the Indo-European delegraph Department, by Sir brederick Goldsmid, Sir J. Bateman Champain, Sir Robert Murdoch Smith, and others. 'Pfjgre were stories in almost every book on Persia of the deeds of heroism of members of the staff, which well deserved to be put together into a single volume, and would make an epic. There was not a station from Bushire to Teheran which had not half-a-dozen graves of men of the Department who were killed or had died in the execution of their duty—Major Wells, Sergeants Codings (killed at Khanch Zinian) Wittkugel (died of wounds with the S.P.R.) Hamilton, Hockey, Smith, and many others : in their death, as in their life, they upheld the good name of their native land ; than such men Persia had no truer friends. Pandit Ahluvalia Gopalji said the audience had heard a very interesting and instructive story of a wonderful adventure, with a lot of chronological data, but the most noticeable point in the whole venture was that the thrills were British and the money was Indian. He thought that the Indians should have more of the thrills, and not only pay the money. The system was a very important nerve sustaining Imperialism, and unfortunately India had to pay for it. Sir Arnold Wilson asked permission to reply to the previous speaker. The whole of the capital had been found by the Government of India, and when he had last been in the Persian Gulf and had pressed the Department to reduce rates, they replied that they were not in a position to do so because the Government of India insisted on getting a commercial return for the money invested ; the Govern ment of India was receiving between 7 and 8 per cent. That was not a bad return • on the money, seeing that money could be borrowed in India at less than 5 per cent ; the Pandit was perhaps unaware that three out of four of the telegraph staff were British Indian subjects. Another point which Mr. Simpson had not brought out was that the reason why the Government of India in i860 had undertaken the laying of the line was that the first cable laid under Government guarantee by a commercial company via the Red Sea and Aden to India had been a failure, and in the commercial and political interests of India it was decided to make every effort to connect India with Europe by land. Mr. Robert a-Ababrelton, speaking as one of the oldest Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts, said he was deeply indebted to the Society for bringing up discussions on means of communication between the various parts of the British Empire. He hoped the Secretary would continue to bring up such subjects for discussion. Mr. C Slocombe said he had been attached to the Indo-European Telegraph Department in London for a great number of years, having served under several Directors-in-Chief. He was very pleased to hear the handsome tribute paid by the present Director-in-Chief to his staff in the remote regions of Persia and the Persian2 I Gulf. He had known a full generation of those men. Some of them were veterans in the service, and were approaching the age of retirement. Others had recently been sent out, but he knew that one and all of them were keen on their job, and their one object and aim in life was to be loyal to their Department and to their Chief, to keep the line in good working condition night and day, and to get the messages through as rapidly and as accurately as possible. He had been very pleased to hear what the previous speaker had said with regard to the work of the Royal Society of Arts in stimulating lectures such as that which had just been delivered. It used to be said of a Government Department that to hear nothing whatever about it was a clear proof that it was well administered ; and probably that was the reason w T hy so little had been heard about the Indo-European Telegraph Department. He had recently seen it remarked, in an excellent book by Mr. Brown, that those who were engaged in the work of international communication were assisting in the real material and spiritual progress of the world. That was so to-day, he had no doubt, but it had been much more true in the days when the pioneers, Colonel Goldsmid, Colonel Patrick Stewart, Sir John Champain and others, were doing their tremendous w r ork in opening lines of communication between remote parts of the w r orld. In those days the Crimea and the Mutiny were recent events, the Abyssinian campaign was in progress, and the people of England w r ere very anxious for news, and it was therefore a matter of very great importance that those lines should be con structed. To show the feeling which had inspired those men, he wished to read a rough draft letter written by Major Champain, as he then w r as, to his Chief, at the end of which the following w r ords occurred : “ I cannot but think that in carrying out a grand enterprise like this we should be actuated by a higher motive than that of securing large returns only, and that by adding to our means of communica tion and reducing our charges we should place the use of the Indo-European Tele graph within the reach of all, and confer a vast benefit on the w'orld. That showed the spirit in which the work had been done in the old time. As to the future, it was on the knees of the gods ; but whatever it might be, he was sure that under the inspiration of the past, and under the wise administration of the present Director-in-Chief, the staff would continue to give of their best, both at home and in the East, to the Government which they served and to the public which formed their customers. On the motion of the Chairman, a vote of thanks to the lecturei was carried unanimously. .] i v_ OFFICE NOTE. | P.A.
