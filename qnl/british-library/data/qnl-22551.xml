Vi- _ # &amp; * ■ ' *To Tlxe Political Agent, Bahrein at Karachi, The Secretary to the Hon* ble the Political Resident in the Persian aulf 9 Sir, I hare the honour to forward for the ocnsideration of tiie .ion'Tjle the .Political Resident and transmission to the GoTernment of India a request for an additional lower grade clerk for the Ternaoular office of the Bahrein Agency. 2 • The urgent need for e^tra staff in the English O -tioc has oeen met, 'but the increased and increasing work of the Vernacular Office has not so far been recognised. The deyelopment of Bahrein could not Tout hare a repercussion on the toranaa of the office which handles all the Agency's Judicial work, and a point has now 'been reached when work, Bxp is oadl cie-.a ed and the interests of justice are be* ginning to suffer. In fact, the delays that occur are un- farourably coiaaented on by the public, ^hc not unreasonably expect a certain return of efficiency and despatch in handling . their cases for the payment of court fees .^It m*st not be supposed that the staff of the vernacular office are res ponsible for these delays, in fact during the pas^year some reorganisation has taken place and suits hare been Reeded up and a number of cases, reaching back in some instances as far as 1924 and 1925, hare been finally decided. This has been done in spite of the absence on leave of the Indian Assistant, and the credit is largely due to the Hard work and long hours put in by the staff, I wish to point out in this connection, that in the event of a leave vacancy occurring, o are not (as in more fortunate offices in India) suppliedsupplied with a trained aubsltute, and are aluost invariably A required to make looal arrangements wliich means bringing in some outsider who h as no experlenoe of the work he is required to do« 4• The last year has seen a oonsiderable increase in the number of oases registered at the ^igenoy and posted for hearing and I compare oelow the figures for this half year 9 up to the 30th June 1930• Registered* Posted. 192 9 971 2000 1930 1236 2423» This means that oases registered in this year will amount to nearly 2500 9 an increase of some 25/( over former years. 5e I do not consider that this is entirely due to an increase in the litigiousness of our resaortis3ant8 f but to the fact that the Bahrein land Department are conducting what amount to Settlement operations and that as a by produetx a considerable number of points arise for decision txiat develop into law suits. land now has a much enhanced price and rights that were formerly of no value are now eagerly asserted, further the number of British Indian subjects (whose recourse to litigation Is far more marked than the Arab or Persian) has increased* and even the advent of so small an undertaking as the electriotification of Manama 9 whose technical staff are all Indians 9 has had an appreciable effect on our labours. This last causes me considerable uneasiness 9 for it proves beyond doubt that the advent of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in October will provide much additional work for which 1 have not the staff. In faot I may be obliged to ask for an additional clerk without waiting for the beginning of the financial year. 6. To meet these inoreased duties cuid. carry out the nWutf. 1 ▼•rnawilar W0Pk of a political agency from time to time includes veiy heavy rushes of work on behalf of tiie .olonlal Office and the High Commissioner for Iraq, I havehave a staff of four olerks; Two of these are pensionable government servants 9 a ti&amp;aX and s^eond grade clerk respective* ly and the third is a local hand styled the Maftri* whoco post has existed since 1914 and is iaet from Office Allowance which was then increased to meet the charge • The fourth or 'Qadhis clerk* is another local hand whose attainments are very slight but e^ual to his duties which consists of taking cases to the ^adhis and seeing that orders are properly re* corded and reporting progress made* He is only paid Rso75/- a month and knows no English^ 7. It will be seen that I have only two men on whom I can depend 9 the 1st and 2nd Munshis, and when I am short handed (as at present) and one is replaced by a local hand difficulties arise and great strain is placed on the office• Temporary clerks, often with local interests, handle bigfc oases and have a considerable degree of responsibility, and with over 2000 cases in a year with some 4500 hearings and the issue of over 10,000 summonses it will be realised that the Political Agent and the Indian Assistant are not able to supervise matters as closely as they would wish* Repeated instances of corruption on a large scale in the past have shown that temporary or local hands are not suitable for this form of work, and I therefore request that an additional lower division clerk may be sanctioned for the vernacular branch of this Agency with effect from the 1st April 1931 and budget provision made« I am asking Mr»Gazdar to forward proposition statements to you direct» T 3» I am aware that requests for increased recurrir^ expenditure require to be very fully Justified at the present moment, and had it been possible I would have endeavoured to carry on with the staff at my disposal. It is important to note, however, that the increased work of this office has not Tseen without marked financial benefit to Government and court fees have veiy considerably increased• In fact for the first six months of this year receipts under this head amount to 11,480/- as against 5626/- for the first six months of lastlast year, an inorease of Tery nearly IOQ^ f and I iiare no 3/ doutot at all tnat SEtt.OOO/- will oe realised before the year is out. This inoreast is sufficient to pay for tMs clerk fire times oror, in f act the court foes of Bahrein (which probably exceed those of the oora'bined Gulf Agencies) are sufficient to pay for the entire clerical staff twice oyer* I therefore trust that this point will be giyen its due weight and that the Hon^le the Political Resident will be good enough to recoomend my request for the faTourable considera tion of the GoTernment of India« I ha. to the honour to be 9 Sir, Your most obedient servant.

To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to letter No.K-24 dated the 23fd August 1930, and to forward, for the information of the Kon f ble the Political Resident, the actual figures of Court Pees and the number of cases heard at this AgeiiCy duriii^ the past /ear. 2. The total number of cases, 2317, is verj close to my estimate and exceeds last year's figure of « 1836 by 481, an increase of over 25^. The rise in Court Fees is also remarkable, and the amount collected in 1930 now stands at Rs-19,413, as compared with its. 12,996 for the past year. In fact, but for the acute financial stringency this figure would have been exceeded and the 21,000, I 'J estimated for, would certainly have been realised; at the moment however, few large cases are being filed as the litigants have not the money to pay the Court Pees, and even if they Tiled a case and were succesful, the amount ■ they would receive would in all probability scarcely make it worth their while. 3. Actually, the amount of work involved is greater than this years total would suggest. Owin^ to the destitution of the small traders, who are unable to recover little, if any, of their outstandings from divers, execution proceedings are very lengthy, and in cases which would have been rapidly settled a year or two ago it is now very difficult and tiresome to fix up instalments or indeed to recover anything at all. s4, When the amount of Court Fees ii considered it must be remembered that the Agency is now obliged to issue free visas for British Subjects going to India and also that we no longer issue Qertificates of Identity to Persians. This has probably involved us in a loss of 2500/- per annum in Court Fees and this should be taken into account if these figures are compared with 1928 and earlier years. • 5. The year has proved conclusively that the staff are insufficient for the work and it has onljf been by working extra time, for example the greater part of the Christmas holidays, that it has been possible to ketp up with the work. Any delay in settling cases means great hardship to the poor, as it means that parties and witnesses living at a distance have to lose a day^ work and wages for each hearing. 6. I trust that there will be no difi'iculiy or delay in the sanctioning of this post, for if the extra clerk asked for is not available by the time the pre- Rakbah rush commoncos the consequences will be very serious. I have the honour to be.

He was in our school here for about six years.and graduated from the High School in 1927.He did exception- ally well in his studies and upon his graduation I took him on as a primary teacher.After a year at teaching.he decided to travel a bit in order thus to complete his education, and went to India. He spent considerable time in the Punjab and Karachi.and became I believe ^uite fluent in Hindustani. He has no bad habits and is an omniverous reader. I think you would find nim a faithlul and willing clerk and anxious to get on. He is quite sociably inclined and gets on well with people,indeed he would be an asset to any mejlis in Bahrein. He has taken up type-writing very recently. He has none of the objectionable characteristics of the Draqi effendi.

Uncer theretar^' to the Hon r ble the Political Resident in the 'ersian Culf,Basrah, 14th March 1931 Respected Sir, On my way to Basrah I landed at Kuwait where I remained two days and then proceeded to Basrah. On y arrival I v /as shov/n four applications by the following persons and was given their addresses to co unicate direct with them. On the second day of my arrival I also went to Mr. Van Esse. Mr. Van Esse said that he was read;': r to assist in getting a cleric for Bahrain, 'but that he was sure no suitabl man will accept the appointment at such low pay. He said' You want to purchase a good pearl but offer fifteen rupees only. I am afraid you will not be able to get one'. He said that he had good and suitable persons^ but that he would not advico the to go for less than Rs 300/- P.M. He said that the only person suitable and willing to accept the appointment was Abdul Majid who v /as recommended by him. * (1) A.Husain (2) Muhammad Shakib al Khaz'ali (3) Hasan Zuhair (4) Anwar Mukhlis Out of the. four persons mentioned above Hasan Zuhair was exceptionally good and suitable person. He belonged to az- Zuhair famous family of Basrah and his father was a big land lord. He is a sunni Ifuhammad^aged 22 years. A graduate oftoe ^ _ American University of Beirut^ and a Matriculated Student of \ ^ | Edinburgh University Scotland. He was exceptionally good in VV Arabi0 - ThiS y0UnS man ISSShM at me when I informed him r*f 0i '' 1C ?ay - and aefinetly said that he would not go for less thar \\ Rs 250/- The first two wer ^uite incompetent.

The attached a specimen of the best of ^ A them with a Epar real translation. Having sppnt eight days without 'being sue essful in finding a more suitable person tlian llvik lis I thought I will only be v/a|iisting time to wait longer. I therefore wrote a letter to H.B.iPs Consul and requested him to send you the telegram about Mukhlis and Abdul Ma^id. Anwar is of a respecatble family of Baghdad and is the son in-law of Sulaiman Fajdhi of Basrah v /ho is a famous Advocate and merchant. He is good in Arabic but requires super vision while translating from Arabic into English. He having had experience wfiile working in G—overnment Department will have less time than Abdul Majid who had not experience at all. He can also adopt himself according to circumstances and will be using T Aqal and Kufiyah when landing in Bahrain. I taiBccjfexkEH tried my best to find a more suitable person but was not succesful / inspite of the help of my friends in the G-overnment Department and merchants. Anwar knows Turkish,,Hiscs I hope he proves satisfactory. He is leaving this evening and his services will begin from today. Having paid for he telegram sent to you on 11th March I enclose herewith Receipt for Rs.56 /7- and request that the amount may be remitted to me fagymyx atirKuwait.

You will observe clearly that Mr. Abdullatlf has changed his mind and accepted his post from which he previously happened to resign for no distinct reason. You may not fall to take notice of the temporary vacancy promised by the Political Agent which I will not care to fill although recommended as leading to something permanent. Under the above circumstances I have to inform you that I wish to perform the post about which you have already told me. I am ready to be about as soon as I receive instructions. Kindly let the call to joA-'ney be undertaken by the Political Agent at Kuwait in success. I wish to know about your telegraphic address. In conclusion I feel very grateful to you for your kind consideration. Awaiting your favourable reply.No. 296. To Mr.JaBsim Muiiammad, Kuwait. Political Agency,Kuwait. Dated the 16th April 1931• Memorandara. Mr.Jasb4ra Ivluhararaad Is Informed thut the Political Agent much regrets that he has kept him waiting so long for a reply to his application for the post of Munshl to this Agency. He was compelled to refer the matter to Bushlre where the natter was delayed for some considerable time,and when a final reply came Mr.Abdul Latif had changed his mind and withdrawn his resignation. The Political Agent however wishes Mr.Jassim Muhammad to know that he was quite satisfied with the test whieh he gave him both written and oral, and will register his name in the Agency records as a suitable candidate should any vacancy fall due in the future. It is possible now to say that a temporary vacancy may occur in July next lasting for 4 months and if mr. Jasbim Muhammad cares to fill same when the times comes his name will be considered and recommended. It is as well to realize thit a post held temporarily nearly always leads to sometaing permanent. (Sgd) Dickson. Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.■T~-»Tr 7 ^ * 1 ■ Q Kuwait, 16th May 1931 ^ , .r.n- Respected Sir, Re A r ab clerk for Bahrain, Hasan Zuhair( referred to in mj letter dated 14th March 1931) had accepted a post in the Port Directorate Basrah and does not accept the pay offered. Jasim Kuwaiti is a young man, smart and of good character, but requires time to learn office work. In my opinion 1 Abdul Majid who was recommended by Mr. ¥an l^sse has a wider knowledge and will be more useful for office work. He is now getting about Rs.150/- in Basrah and will be willing to accept the Passport Post should Mr. Ras Masud take up the new permanent one. Jasim will probably be going to Bahrain in a short time with H.S. Shaikh Ahmad and jchkx I can arrange with him to see you on his arrival, should H .E. decides to take him with him. If 'Abdul Majid is wanted.his departure can be fix -ed direct with r.Van Esse or H.B.M 1 s Consul Basrah. His address is:- 'Abdul Majid Hajji Mahmud Kubbah,Saimar,Basrah. I do not see any other suitable person on this sid who knows good Arabic and English. With due respects and regards. I U d-l Yours obediently, ' % 4;D.c. IX fA British 'Residency &amp; Consulate-'eneral zr 7 ! /f-?/ . 7 • '3/- ^ E 7 / • i aci desired tc refer tc the political 'Residents telegram dated the 12th June 1931 regard- In* the appclntmeiit of Mr* Janjua tc the pc^t cf 3rd Munshi. Gclcnel Biscoe has laid it down as a general principle that in future only Arahs and Persians should 'be recruited for the Vernacular 'branchy and he has ^iven orders that the single Indian U' ' . , that rnrnains on that side should 'be transferred to I \ n j . iA ' the English Branch on the first suitable opportunity that presents itself. Your recommendation runs counter to this general principle / and for this reason raj or Fowle does not feel disposed in the aosence of Colonel Biscoe to make any final decision in the matter. He has accord ingly agreed to your appointing !£r. Janjua only as probationer and final orders will he passed 'by Colonel Biscoe when he returns next autumn. Under the circumstances explained above it is not at all certain, in fact I might even say that it is impro'balDlG / that Colonel Biscoe ..ill agree to ■■■■■■Mr ** . .. your suggestion. Some little time ago you commented rather adversely on the style of the Arabic letters that emairbed from this office and the inclusion of Indians on the vernacular side manifestly does not help matters in this respect. Captain C. C. Prior, # . I Political Agent, ^ ^ B a h r e in. / e ^p^. Ref•Residency's letter regarding the additional Yemacular Office Clerk. It is very unfortunate for me to notice that the Residency does not find in me a man ahle to carry out successfully the duties of the vernacular office and is unwilling to bestow the favour of confirmation upon me. First of all I 'beg to point out that it is not only Arabic that is necessary to qualify a clerk to hold a permanent post in the vernacular office,a knowledge of English as well as of Persian is as essential as that of Arabic to make an ideal clerk in this line.There are as you know about 2500 cases a year and one could hardly find a case in which proceedings or judgment was ever recorded in Arabic.The judicial work being the main object of a regular vernacular office here,it is quite manifest that the greater part of the work is done in English and the remaing part is divided in Persian and Arabic. THiatever I could acquire in Arabic during the past six months is known to you and it was aquired without the help of a teacher.Now when I have found a teacher and give a lot of time to these studies I hope and assure you that I would gain double the knowledge in the next six months that I could get in the past. Ooming to the Persian language I would request you to move the fiesidency to examine me in this language according to the standared of knowledge found in the Persian recruits,or to ask them to hold a competitive examination for all the vernacular office clerks in Persian literature,classical Persian,translation and conversation etc and I am sure that I would remain in no case behind them even if some of them would find it their mother tongue.If it is not agreed to a test in all the three languages would be ,1 think,welcomed by all the clerks. The question of transfers might have occurred to the Residency,but if on the transfer of an Arabic -knowing clerk it is » considered that he should not be transferred to a Persian Office or English where they would not prove satisfactory,it would 'be easier for them to decide in ray case where there would he two chances at their disposal as compared with only one. The suggestion of the Residency that I should remain on probation for the next six months,seems to be an hard one.If on the return of Gol.Biscoe my confirmation is not agreed to,not to speak of the loss of Rs 25/- a month, I think there would be no room for me here in the office. It would be reasonable if the new clerk remains on probation till this case is settled. If the Residency still does not agree to confirm me, I would request you to recommend me to the Siestan Office where as ^'Sihao infomgLtion a vacancy has J occurred.fie also believe^ that soon hereafter some posts are falling vacant in the Leshjded and Duzdab Office,and I would be greatly obliged to you if I could get my name registered there,that I may get a chance.The question of age nowadys in India ,as you know is getting very strict and if I do not get a permanent chance I would spoil my life altogether. yL -tr -&gt; ^•+- Al -4. : — -X (ZyJ J.^ oOn UJ-lLcT).0. l lc. l British Residency h CJcnsulate-Oeneral Bushire, the fL# ^ June 1931. / i w zsh -' M * /&gt; ' &amp;W-*'' , 1 am desired tc 'refer ycu to ycur memcra.ndum Nc. 640 dated the 31st May 1931 In which ycu state ycu 'require an Arab tc fill the pest cT Passport clerk. / ^ For seme time new Celcnel Biscee has 'been en the fjC Ott^lcek^ for an Arah ef geed f amily and educatien, rather cf the type cf Saiyid Ahduir Ha^zag. ef Bahrein^te enlist in the vernacular Branch sheuld a vacancy eccur and with this purpese he wrote to Celonel Dickson asking whether he knew of a suitable man. Dr. Greenway has now replied recommending one Jassim Mahammad and I enclose a copy 'both of his letter and of its enclosure. At the moment there is no vacancy in the Vernacular Branch, hut it has occurred to Major Powle that perhaps you might like to try him as Passport clerk and see hew he does. If he proves juitahle and Oolonel Biscee withholds his sanction to the transfer of ITr. janjua to the Vernacular Side^which he may veil do y then Jassim Mahammad would he available for the post ef 3rd Munshi and you would get a man whom you already knew. if this suggestion meets with your approval you should settle matters direct .vith Political Agent, Kuwai^ hut in any case 1'ajor Fowle would like to he informed in due course what you decide'in the matter.

Sir, I beg to state that I have not applied for any leave since joining service in July 1937 and should be very grateful if you could kindly recommend to Bushire to grant me 7 months earned leave (4 months on average and 3 months on half average pay) with effect from the middle of January 1942 after the return from leave of the Head Munshi, on or about the 10th of January. Although I am not applying for medical leave I beg to state in support of this application that I contracted trachoma last year and though I have been cured then it returned again this year. I have now been advised by the Q.M.O. to go to Bombay for treatment by an eye specialist as otherwise it is likely to recur every summer. I beg to remain. Sir, r ' * ' ' mt 2nd Munshi &amp; Offg.

In the circumstances, it will, perhaps, answer no useful puipose asking Bushire to reconsider their decision. 3.

Although I know tnat G-overnment allowances are not a source of profit, yet I feel that, unaer the circumstances I am entitled to draw my T.A» as if I nad travelled by 2nd, because I aid not purposely travel deck ana tnus seek to profit. Moreover Government loses nothing by tnis whilest : my family ana myself lost the comfort of travelling in a cabin auring a cold season. Tne B.I.

I iiave spoken about tue matter to K.C# iii January ana at tola me to wait till an office uroer coraes from Bushire. In Marcn, as rauch time has passed witnout result, I spoke to A-P-A* was surprised to learn that I was not being paia on tnat scale. On enquiring from K.C., A*P.A. was inforraea tiiat no such provision was made in the Buaget, ana altnougn ne very kindly consented to write to Bushire, after tne Heaa I'unshi arrives, for provision in the current year's Budget, ne expressed doubts as to whether such provision will be made. As all tnat time I nave worked hard, during office hours and at home, to cope with tne work of the V-O*, I feel I have really earned tne difference to whicn I am entitled. If no provision was made it was not die to my fault, so tnat I may be penalized for it, as surely some oiit is responsible for adequate provisions for all tne staff whetuer in an officiating capacity or not. Therefore, since provisiun by Bushire is doubtful, I snould be very grateful if you will kindly sanction payment of tne difference between my salary and tjat of Officiating Head runsni for the time I aave officiated, £bout montns, from unofficial funds ol tne Agency./ Lj- wed (tj y4]*t\T\ [fyujuii^c') V/e SHbmitted our final btatement of anticipated excesses and savings in the budget grants for 1938-39 on 4th February 1939. All final adjustments have to be made by Bushire by the middle of February, as the Government of India do not accept any applications for additional grants n * or surrenders of savings after the end of February» Me would have required an additional sum of h3.660/- under Pay of Establishment if the post of Head Munshi had been filled up immediately after the death of Mr.Abdul Latif. As up to the time of the preparation of our final financial review on 4.2.39 the post had remained vacant and there was no likelihood of its being filled up during February also, the additional amount was not provided for. '/hen Mr.Boodai put up the matter it was too late. If Bushire agree to issue an office order showing Mr.Boodai as Offg.H.M.Bahrain for the period from 4th Jan. to 18th April 1939 we can draw the difference of his own and H.M's pay for the whole period from this year's budget grant and ask for the provision of the additional amount thus incurred at the time of our first financial review in October next. Bushire may or may not agree to give Mr.Boodai the benefit of additional pay for the period from 4th Jan.to 28th Feb.1939 which falls in the last financial year but there is no apparent obstacle in respect of the period from 1st March to ISth A-oril 1939.

This will also facilitate our adjustment of accounts, as the new munshi engaged could be shown in the bills as temporary 2nd Munshi, and Mr. Boodai as Offtg.

C u } y 1 I.A's 90 days' leave expires on 27th September ana he should report at Karachi on the 28th. He is due 12 days 1 joining time, he should therefore report for duty at Bahrain on the forenoon of 10th October 1340. II. Dr. Sidciq applied for 90 days 1 leave. Page 207 file 1/19-II. P.R. sanctioned 90 days' leave vide page 209 and 210. This was reported to A.G.C.H. vide page 221. I find that A.G.C.R. lias sanctioned 120 days leave salary excluding joining time and infers t© Bushire EKGtaKajunEnjtx draft notification. The Gazette notification about this has not arrived so far and therefoie it cannot be checked whether Bushire or A.G.C.R« have done this error. I suggest that we telegiaph Bushire on the lines of the draft below. /l I. r % La M** yu* rsr p^ !- x/ S. 5'y/ /\^ T&gt; 0 The authority sanctioning a relief when Mr. ^oodai was officiating as Head Kunshi till January last is at page 150 flagged. Now it appears that the total strength of the Persian Gulf Clerical Cadre will be exceeded if a relief is engaged for Mr. Bood^i. It appears also that the leave reserve applied for the vernacular cadre has not been sanctioned by the Govt, of India. 7e cannot exceed of the sanctioned strength without the concurrence of the Govt, of India . 2. It seems doubtful if M r. Boodai will be able to carry on single handed for such a long time especially when he will have to attend to both the P.A. and A.P.A's courts and also both the senior and Junior joint courts. 3. The alternatives seem to be:- (a) If we cannot engage a munshi by debit to Central Revenues, Bushire may give us Rs.900 from their office allowance for a munshi here @ Rs.150/- p.m. for six months. (b) Mr. Jasim bin Mohammad is a Munshi under the temporary war establishment for the Political Agent. He was lent to the Publicity Office for censor work etc. Now we may recall him to work in the Arabic Office and apply for a censor clerk. (c) Bushire may be asked to send us one of their own munshis temporarily if they have one to spare. 3. Secretary perhaps may not be able to help us in the matter unless he consults his files at ^ushire. 7e may explain the position and I submit a draft for approval. /'' ./ ■ .
