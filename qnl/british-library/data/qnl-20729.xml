HHL.REVIEW , Persian 31de t The Allied victories over Germany and Japan were both warmly welcomed. In the Khorramshahr area the American Forces completed their evacuation of Persia by moving out on 30th December, By that date the Iranian Naval base at Khorramshahr had been returned by the British Navy to the Persian Government and the transfer of responsibility for security from the British to the Persian forces had reached an advanced stage. 2. The ll;45 grain harvest in the South was a good one and the date harvest was also plentiful. Prices however did not drop and the assistance to the needy given by the local branch of the Anglo-Persian Relief and Reconstruction Fund fulfilled a real need, and the British share in it earned wide praise. 3. In July the peace of the districts of Hiat Daud, Lirawi and Rud Hilleh was disturbed by a dispute between Fathullah Khan Hiat Daud and Mohammed Ali Lirawi, which was still unsettled at the close of the year. Insecurity prevailed in Dashti and in Dashtistan. Tang- istan, however, remained secure due to the firm and ruthless methods of Rais Ali Tangistani (Chapiri). 4. In September the Bushire Shahristan was separated from that 6£ Fars and brought directly under Tehran, a reform which will help considerably in improving ;, ■ - \ ■ the standard of the local administration. 5. Relations with the Governor of Bushire and the Heads of local departments were excellent throughout the year. 6. The security of the Bushire-Shiraz road remained on the whole good. i I v \ \ / 7. \ / ni V i*5) ?• A new American Financial adviser, a Mr*John W. Phillips was appointed, a trssiendous improvement on his / predecessor who had secured an unenviable reputation for corruption. The American military personnel In this area were agreeable and cooperative. B. H.K, 3ir Header Builard paid a visit to Bushire in April, • Arab 9* Oil. The Kuwait Oil Company commenced operations • i planned on an export programme of 30,000 barrels of crude oil a day. By the end of the year much progress had been made and the staff had greatly increased. the Bahrain Oil Company produced an average of 20,000 barrels a day. The construction of a causeway, pier and wharves to permit the direct bunkering of ocean going ships at oltra was almost completed by the end df the year. With the end of the war the large scale refining of high octane aviation spirit ceased. Petroleum Concessions Ltd., restarted work In Qatar and are putting into operation a heavy drilling and production progra? e. In March they obtained an oil/ concession from the Huler of Umn al Qalwaln. Exploration in the Truclal Coast area was planned for the Winter of 1946-46. 10. iiir m the Trooping transit Scheme resulted Ixi heavy military air traffic throughout the year along the Arab Coast. In May the U.S.A. Air transport Command ceased operating from aerodromes in Muscat territory which were, however, continued to be operated by the Hoyal Air Force. there was a larger /increase© - 3 - increase in the services of the British Overseas Airways Corporation but owing to service priorities and the pref erence given to long distance travellers} passages frora the Persian Gulf were difficult to obtain, So final decision was reached about a new aorodro: e at Bahrain, and air officers concanding continued to change with bewildering rapidity. 11. r'alforcB- Lieutenant General Sir Arthur Smith, General Officer Commanding in Chief Palforco paid a visit to iiushlre in npril on his way to 3hlraz. Such problems as arose with Paiforco were rapidly and smoothly settled with his assistance. 12. Haw . Our relations with the Wavy remained as ex cellent as ever, but the number of war ships suffered a severe reduction. I 3 ' Education. educational activity in Bahrain and Kuwait were much hampered by the failure of the British Council to provide a .-Irector of Education. Xho iCuwait Oovernnient opened a hostel in Cairo for their students. Several Bgyptian teatfhers were engaged by Kuwait and Bahrain. The indulging in propaganda by sosae of them suggests that the action of the Egyptian Governnent in paying half their salaries is not wholly altruistic. 14. Conmerclal. The end of the war brought little relief to trade as few of the manifold restrictions in force had boon / lifted by the and or the y«ar f and shipping space continued to be scarce. Stea&amp;ar conmunicatlon In the Gulf was In adequate and irregular. 15 * Imperial Bank of Iran at Kuwait continued /toto do a flourishing business* the business of the newly opened branch In Bahrain showed a steady increase and Its competition with the long established Eastern Bank was beneficial to trade, and say have been the cause of the Americans not proceeding with the proposal to open a branch of the National City Bank at Dhahran. At the end of the year the Imperial Bank of Iran was considering the opening of branches at Dubai and Muscat# 16* Food rationing and price control measures were enforced with success throughout the year in all the ^halkhdons« 17. Despite the fact that the Indian Pest Office at Bahrain was making a monthly profit of some 9000/- staff, accommodation and furniture were kept far below the standard required for bare efficiency, in fact the Bahrain Oil Company volunteered to provide the necessary furniture free of charge an offer which was scarcely flattering to the Indian Postal Administration. 18. the number of boats that put out to the pearl i ✓ banks was small but the catch was good and high prices prevailed. i 19. Great pressure was brought to bear by the Bahrain Oil Company to be allowed to undertake their own lightering, which would have been a very serious blow to Messrs Gray Mackenzie, fhe latter firm had invited such action by their general inefficiency but at the close of the year their monopoly was still intact and some improvement promised. 20. internt,a« the State Departraeat appear to be attaching a growing Importance to the United states Consular post at Dhahran.

(v) The office of Under Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was held by Mr. J.Croning,I.S.0., M.B.E., throughout the year except for the period from 7th Sept /ember to ....to 3rd October, when he was on.leave in India. (vi) Major A.L. Greenway, held the post of Residency ourgeon through the year. Dr. H. Kasey, held the post of Assistant Residency Surgeon throughout the year, (vii) Mr. D.J. Stephens held the post of Consular Agent, Lingah, throughout the year. (b) Persia n. (i) Dr. M. Hisabi continued as Governor of Bushire. He proceeded to Tehran on -fea© ^ leave on July 19th and returned to Bushire on 17th October. During his absence Aqai Lutfullah Dowlatshahi, Director of Customs, Bushire, officiated as Governor, for the remainder of the year. (ii) Aqai Lutfullah Dowlatshahi was Director of Customs until the end of October, when he handed over to Aqai Mohammad Ghaffari. (iii) Sarbahr Masoomi was head of the Police Department from the beginning of the year until 3rd August when he handed over to Yawar Muhajir. (iv) The post of Officer Commanding Gendarmerie Bushire, changed hands frequently. The following officers held charge in turn: Sargurd Baiglatl, Sargurd Badipur and Sarvan Sahami, $he last namgd was in charge at the end of the year. (v) Sargurd Pakrawan was Officer Commanding the Garrison, Bushire, until 10th April when he was relieved by Sargurd Arasteh, who held the post for the remainder of the year. (vi) Aqai Rusta'ian was head of the Economic Department, Bushire, until the beginning of October, when he was relieved by Aqai Behruz Kasmai.SECTION II . LOCAL AFFAIH3. (a) The trade of Bushire remained more or less at a standstill owing to the continuance of restrictions on the export of commodities from India and elsewhere. The drift of labour from Bushire, mentioned in the Administration Report for 1944, has continued. In spite of the war having ended there ♦had been by the end of the year, no decrease in the extremely high cost of living in Bushire. (b) During the earlier part of the year two Shiraz newspapers 'Surush' and 'Uqianus', both of which are said to be supported by Soviet funds, persistently advocated the establishment of a branch of the Tudeh party in Bushire. The strong local anti-Russian feeling prevented this cam paign from achieving any results. (c) A few burglaries occurred in Bushire town during the summer. In Burazjan disputes over the distribution of sugar and tea led to frequent fights between the lead ing factions of that place. (d) Work on the Ali Ghangi drinking water scheme con tinued throughout the year. A pump was installed at Burj- i-Muqam, at the edge of the Mashileh, and the reservoir, on high ground nearby, was completed. In spite of the set back inflicted by an exceptionally high tide during June, which led to a seepage of salt water into the clay pipe which brings the drinking water across the Mashileh, the project had almost reached completion by the end of the year. (e) In September the Persian Government announced that the Bushire Shahristan would in future be separated from that of Pars, and that in future the Firmandar, Bushire, would receive his instructions direct from Tehran. This reform, which had long been pressed for by this Consulate- General, should help to improve the standard of the local tL administration. The Fytrmandar will now refer matters/5.. only to Tehran, instead of to the Ustandar, bhlraz, (who had in his turn to isfer them to the capital). In this way when local schemes are proposed they ought in future to receive sanction far quicker than before, and the a- 1 F^rmandar should now find it easier to control the officials serving under him. This reform has already led to a considerable improvement in the local administration of justice. Formerly the local court was a Petty Court (Dadgah-i-Bakhsh) every decision of which had to be refer red for decision to bhiraz, whereas it has now become a Court of First Instance (fiadgah-i-Shahristan) whiSh can decide and pass judgement on any case brought before it. SECTION III . C QMMU NIC ATIONS. (a) k&amp;Hd. The main road to Shiraz, in spite of receiv ing little attention from the Pecsian Road Department, was, up to the end of the year, in fairly j-ood condition. The main road between Sabzabad and Bushire town is still in deplorable condition. The Road Department made a half-hearted attempt to repair it in October, but the earth with which they filled the worst pot-holes was wash ed away by the first winter storm. During August, September and October a mumber of lorries travelling be tween Burazjan and Shiraz were held up and robbed. (bO Sea . Owing to the withdrawal from service in the e 1 Gulf of the 'R^sang', 11 t/Stoosahg M , and 'Tsinan', the steamer situation during the year became worse than ever, and on the average only one slow mail steamer per month called at ABushire. A.I.O.C. tugs continued to assist in providing a means of communication with Khorramshahr. Air . The R.A.F. continued to maintain the Bushire airfield. From the beginning of May Irantour planes maintained a weekly service between Bushire and Tehran via Shiraz and Isfahan, These planes can carry four passen^gers in addition to the mails• In accordance with the proposal made by this Consulate General, the extension of the landing ground at Asalu (referred to in the Administration Report for 1944) has been completed. (d) Telegraphs . At the request of the local autho rities, the Persian Wireless station in Bushire was in September unsealed by H .m 's Consul in the presence of the feting Governor, and formally handed back to the Persian Post and Telegraph Department. On the ©ccasion of the handing back of the transmitter cordial messages were exchanged, through H .m 's Consul, between the Persian authorities and Cable and Wireless Ltd., Bushire. SECTION IV TRIBAL AND POLITICAL (a) Hiat Daud. Liravi and Rud Hilleh . Peace reigned throughout this area until July, when Mohammad Ali Liravi made a sudden descent from Zai- dun upon Hisar fort, which was in the possession of Fath- ullah Khan Hiat Daudi, and, in contravention of the terms of the agreement signed by Mohammad Ali in November 1944, occupied the fort. The Persian Military authorities then proceeded to send two columns, one from Shiraz and one from Khuzistan, to expel Mohammad Ali from the fort. As soon as the Khuzistan column had reached Hisar and occupied it, the Officer Commanding •&amp;£ this detachment proceeded to a point about 9 miles to the South East of Hisar, v^bhere a lively little battle had taken place between the Shiraz column and Mohammad Al^s men. The Officer Commanding &amp;£ the Khuzistan column being senior to the commander of the Fars column ordered the latter to » withdraw.... /6.- 6 - /7. withdraw his troops, which he did - at first to Gana- wah, and later to Shiraz. Fathullah Khan Hiat Daudi proceeded to Tehran in August to complain to the Persian civil and military authorities at Mohammad Ali Liravi's unwarranted occu pation of Hisar fort, and at the way in which the Officer Commanding the Khuzistan column had sided with Mohammad Ali, The only result of Fathullah Khan's complaints in Tehran were that another military detachment, this \ time from Kazerun^was sent to occupy Ganawah, which is the most important port in the Hiat Daud area, with instructions to disarm the Hiat Daudis# The Khuzistan column, which was still in occupation of Hisar &gt; had orders to carry out a parallel disarmament of the adherents of Mohammad Ali Liravi, who, however, had few arms to surrender. As a result Fathullah Khan not only lost possession of his fort at Hisar, but was deprived of over 80 rifles, and was put to much loss by the exactions of a Sarwan (Captain) Urdubadi, who was in command of the Kazeron detachment which carried out the disarmament of the Hiat Daud - Rud Hilleh area, &gt; At the end of the year the question of whether Fathullah Khan was to be allowed to re-occupy Hisar fort was still undecided. The Khuzistan column was i still in occupation of the fort but the Kazerun de tachment had in November returned to Kazerun, (b) Dashtistan . So great was the insecurity caused by feuds between the leading factions of Burazjan that in Septem- ber a special detachment of the Persian army had to be quartered in the town. Though tes security had greatly improved, the troops were still stationed in Bura^jan at the end of the year. (c) Tanglstan/8. - 7 - C'5 (c) Taagistan. ♦ Ali Tangistani (Chahpiri), Rais-i-Inti§amat for Tangistan retained his firm hold over the whole of the Tangistan area. In October he was successful in catch ing the thieves who had committed a burglary in the house of the Kxacutive Engineer, Bushire. Rais Ali beat the three thieves implicated in the burglary so severe ly that one of them died and the other two confessed where.the stolen property was hidden, which Rais Ali A* pL- &gt; then proceeded to restore to this Consulate-General. As a result of suc)3 ruthless methods Rais Ali has succeeded in achieving a very high standard of security in Tangistan, which has always httherto been notorious for its thieves and robbers. D^shtv . This area remained in a lawless and disturbed condition throughout the year. (e) Banadi:r-i-Salas . The Nasuri family have continued to maintain security in this area. Their relations with this Consulate-General have remained very friendly, (f) Lingeh. The Consular Agent continued to maintain friend ly relations with the local officials, and, through the Reading Room, with the local public. The conclusion of the war brought to an end the very useful work which the Consular Agent had previ ously been performing a^s censor of the W/f station at Lingeh. SECTION V . PUBLIC RELATIONS (a) Relations with the Persians in both official and....and social spheres continued to be very friendly. The Allied Victories over both Germany and Japan were warmly welcomed, and V.E.Ddy particularly, was celebrated with marked enthusiasm in Bushire town. The bazaars were decorated and illuminated, and the leading officials and merchants gave entertainments in honour of the occasion. Receptions, to which all British subjects as well as the leading Persian officials and notables were invited, were held at the Residency to celebrate V.E.Day and (in the absence, on recess, of the Gonsul-General),at the Consul's house in honour of V.E.Day. (b) Anglo Persian Reading Room Club • The Anglo Persian Reading Room Club has, if any thing increased in popularity. In anticipation of a : &lt; f reduction in the publicity budget, on the conclusion of the War^arrangements were made with the Committee of the Club to put the Reading Room on a more or less self- supporting basis. As a result by the end of the year the whole expense of maintaining the Reading Room, with the exception of the cost of electric light, was being met from the subscriptions of the members of the Reading Room Club. . Moreover the Club members agreed to bear more than half the cost of repairing and white-washing the club premises, which was carried out early in the Summer, An evening reception for the members of the Reading Room Club was held at the Reading Room by H.Mt's Consul to celebrate the Final Victory, The Reading Room Club at Lingah continued to flourish and by the end of the year its membership had increased to 80. The Borasjan Reading Room continued to be well attended. The quality and quantity of the magazines sent i for distribution in the Bushire area was satisfactory. ' The supply of periodicals from India was generally slow /9./10, - 9 - and erratic, • • / (c) Cinemas . A 16m/m projector was supplied early in the year, and with this bi-weekly shows were given in the local schools during term-time throughout the year. The 35m/m projector continued to do very useful work both in Bushire and in the villages further inland. The projector was also taken by sea to the port of G-ananweh, where a cinema show had never previously been seen, A film show was arranged for the members of the Reading Room Club, once a week throughout the year, except during Moharram. (d) A nglo Persian Relief and Reconstruction Fund , The Anglo-Persian Relief and Reconstruction Fund continued to do extremely useful work throughout the year. It supported at the Caravanserai Shakari 86 paupers who would otherwise have been begging in the streets. A.P.R. R.F, medicines were dispensed free of charge to large numbers of sick people in the towns and villages of the Bushire area, where 'no medical service is provided either by the Persian Government or by any private medical pract itioner. During the course of 56 expeditions made by the Mobile Dispensary during the year to villages outside Bushire a total of more than 9000 sick were treated. The balance of the cloth purchased from India by the local committee of the A.P.R.R.F. was distributed per sonally by H.M's Consul in Borazjan, Ahram, Ganaweh, Saadabad, Darwahi and Dehkoneh. A distribution of cloth was also made at Lingeh. As the poor in this area have been unable to buy any cloth during the past five years, the free distribution of cloth through the A.P.R.R.F. has been greatly welcomed, and our action in helping both to cure and clothe the poor has been widely praised,/II. - 10 - I se ction VI . (a) Cereals . As a result of the bumper wheat harvest the Persian Government were able in May to discontinue the rationing of wheat, and for the first time for many years large quantit ies of wheat and barley were brought into Bushire from the surrounding countryside for sale in Bushire town. (b) The dhabanykareh Irrigation Pro.i e ct. Owing to a lack of funds and^apparently^ 7 a lack of interest on the part of the Agricultural Department, this project has made no progress. There are many square miles of prairie in the Shaban^kareh area which at present support only rough grass, and in places a sparse wheat crop, which / could be made to bear a heavy wheat crop if the half-fin- ished canal which runs from Saadabad in the direction of Deh K^neh were to. be completed, and if the land thereby brought under irrigation were to be properly cultivated. At present the land to which canal water has been brought is most inefficiently farmed by the original cultivators of the area, who still use an old-fashioned plough, quite unsuitable for irrigated soil. Unfortunately it at present appears very doubtful whether the Persian Government will ever achieve the double goal of completing the canal and training the cultivators how to farm it properly. Owing to a lack of funds no progress has been made with the proposal to utilize the water of the Mund river for irrigation purposes, Cc) T ea, ou^ar and Piece-goods . o The monopoly for the sale and distribution of tea and sugar remained in the hands of the Persian Government, In Bushire town these commodities are distributed by coupon. The tea and sugar for the areas outside Bushire continued to be landed over to the Haises, who sell most of the allotment for their villages in the Biack Market.- 11 - ■■V • • ' In March the Persian Government made a general distributions^ cotton cloth on a basis of 3 metres per person. The cloth, however, was only suitable for women's wear, and in any case little or any of it reached people living in villages outside of Bushire . In November the Persian Government abolished the piece-goods monoply, and merchants^ were at the end of the year free to import cloth. (d) Agriculture . Owing to plentiful rain during the winter of 1944- 45 the 1946 harvest was the best for 23 years. The autumn rains were very late, and ploughing could not be started till mid December. The rain which fell then, however, was sufficient to encourage the hope of a average crop in 1946. The date crop was also good, and the price of ciates was lower than it has been at any time since 1939. SECTION VII. SHIPPING AND GQia/lERGB . 1 ' (a) Fifty British ships with an approximate tonnage of 1,68,876 tons called at Bushire during the year. The main imports were tea, sugar, piece-ggods etc.; the main exports consisted of gum tragacanth, gum arable, 'attari 1 , assofoetida, wool and carpets. (b) Owing to the great diminution of steamer traffic in the Gulf, the owners of country craft have been enjoy-r ing a period of great prosperity. Dhows carry cargoes / of rice, potatoes, dried fruits, walnuts, ghee etc., to ports on the Arab Coast, whence under a recognized system of barter, they bring back tea, sugar and piece-goods. (c) The Itima dieve h Spinning &amp; Weaving Iv ill . Production was maintained at the same level as the previous year. In February a powerful new electric engine was imported from England and installed. /12.An interim dividend was declared in August amounting to AO 0 /) for the year 1944-46, together with a bonus of 1000 yards of cloth war tit per share. The mill's total profit was shown as Rials 1,000,000/- for the Persian year 1323 (1944-45). SECTION VIII . HEALTH AND QUARAHTIMS . (a) Owing to the lateness of the seasonal rains many cases of malaria occurred during the autumn and early winter, (b) The number of sick attended to and operations performed, as compared with the two previous years was * as follows:- Out patients. I n-patients , O perations . 1943 37,455 14 40? 1944 35,876 7 - 369 1945 38,122 - 391, (cO The quarantine arrangements are in the hands of the local Persian authorities. H.M's Consul, Bushire.

Crude Oil despatches to Abadan totalled 492,821,000 gallons. d ,chapter III BrLIglSH aOFSULATE , SHIHAZ » Appreciation of local conditions, December, 1944 to June, 1945 1. The period under review has been specially notable as a period of peace and security. This, in a »tribal rt province, is a remarkable record and an administrative achievement that should be kept in mind when reading the account of local bickering that follows• 2. Pars has three outstanding personalities who could be a powerful influence for good if they all worked together for the public weal or a powerful influence for bad if they all seek only their own personal ends. The men in question are Qavam ul Mulk who seems blindly determined to play the part of the villian of the place. General Firuz the Governor-Geareral who is the often ineffective fairy godmother and Muhammad Kasir Khan the impetuous and directionless leader of the Q.ashqai who thinks he has the one true claim to fill the role of hero. 3. Hasir Khan is wh^t fate has made him,. That is he was born the eldest son of a tyrannical tribal leader with an anti-British reputation, he suffered imprisonment under Heza Shah and saw his father die (of natural causes) under restraint. When the Allies entered Persia in 1942 Isfasir Khan escaped to his native mountains where (at least mentally) he has remained ever tince and where he is at a complete loss to know what to do next or to work out where he stands. The facts that on the one hand he and his family claim to have made approaches to us over a period of years and to have have received little or no encouragement and on the other hand that in addition to their record during the last war they received German parachutists in the present war do not ielp Nasir to define his position and to fix on some safe and sure line of policy for the future. He wants to get on our side and so has become reconciled to Qavam ul Mulk but heither of them trusts the other and the alliance is not likely to be a lasting one. 4. t^avam ul Mulk is known, too well in Fars, as the faithful friend of the British. This is a reputation of v/hich (^avam has taken the fullest advantage in the pursuit of his own ends. He has not been above implying that s consuls come and go in Shiraz according to whether they suit him, that he has access when required to Smbasay archives and that he receives his directions straight from London. Because his hearers are eager to win out support and have never heard the lie given to his pretentions, Q.avara is able to get his implications of British backing accepting in general by all classes of people through out the lenght and breadth^ of Fars and in particular by persons such as Nasir ^.abhqai and political parties such as the Hezb Democrat ( which represents the bazaar of Shiraz and hag a backing of big proprietors and landowners). 5. The last twenty years seem to have taught ^avam nothing and he is now perhaps past learning. He is a rich man and a mean one. He is as public spirited as a feudal baron and his ultimate aim s ems to be the increase of his own wealth and influence. H© is, as the Tudeh Party says, a frank reactionary and, as such, a millstone around our neck. 6. Between the uneasy bedfellows, ^avam . ul Mulk and Hasir Qashqai stands Geareral Firuz undetermined and unhappy. He cannot torget that as a 4 a j ar prince he is a superior person and yet he suffers from the inferiority complex that he does not enjoy our complete confidence. Firuz is generally held to be weak because he is anxious to please everyone. a stronger man than Firuz would have called ^avam'S bluff long ago. But we are2. in^no position to criticise Firuz because his weakness largely a. ises from uncertainty as to the amount of support Qavam enjoys from us. Whatever his past Firuz, too, claims'that he wishes to work with us but lacks precise directives. 7. The results of Qavam 1 s arrival in ^hiraz as the self- appointed champion of freedom defending Fars against the Russians onslaught have not been very nappy. Qavam seems to have made up ris mind that^the best form of defence is attack with the result that he got mixed up in a very unrewarding newspaper campaign that resulted in much mud being slung at him and aimed at us. This profited only the four Tudeh youths that formed the opposition to Qavam and were delight d at the importance thus given to themselves.and the publicity they obtained. 8. From his press campaign Qavam preceded to some violent quarrelling with the Governor-General in which he was backed and encouraged by Khosru Qashaai, Nasir Khan's youngest brother and irresponsible and even vicious youth with a capacity for mischief which there seems to be no bounds. By associating himself with and suffering himself to be guided by Khosru Cashoai Qavam lost much face locally, _ The u overnor-General claims to be as alive as Qavam to the Russian menace but believes that the greatest immunity from the infilteration of communistic ideas can be secured by improving the lot of the poor by for instance undertaking works of public utility than by embarking on polemics. During his term of office General Firuz has opened the so-called 100 bed hospital housed local orphans in new surroundings and orovided a new permanent home for beggars. He has also laid the foundation stone of a new medical school that is to open within three months a nd is intended to provide a supply of doctors for work in outlying villageswhere at the present moment no medical attention is obtainable,. The Governor-Generalhas tried to increase the consump tion of oil fuel in place of the charcoal and firewood the use of which is responsible for the deforestation of this formally well wooded province. As a result too of consular intervention a number oi the A.I.O.G. distributing centres that had been closed iswing to the war have been reopened. The completelist is now : Agents : Fasa, Jahrun; Distributing Centres; Sarvistan, Istahbanat. Darab, Niriz, Abr Quh, Ardekan, Firuzabad, Most of the bakeries in hiraz have now changed over from wood to oil fuel. Increased use of oil fuel in bakeries throughout the province is retarded by the high cost of installing the necessary burners. 10 • Progress has also been made under the encouragement of General Firuz with various local water schemes. Two British engineers have collected on the spot data for the ^reparation of a plan for piping the ^hiraz town, water supply . It looks as if this project will materialize. A nother scheme under active consideration is that to dam the flood waters of the Shesh Pir springs and valley behind a convenient gorge and so provide a reserve store of water for the irrigation of the ^niraz plain in Summer, This scheme if it goes through should render service to agriculture and encourage local interests to go ahead with similar schemes in, the Mervdasht (Persepolis) plain, at Fasa and-at Firuzabad. 11. The crash in price levels that was exoected to follow the end of the war in Europe did not take place. i'he bazzaar has remained buoyant and there have been no bankruptcies to undermine confidence. The tendency of prices is to fall but the downward movement has been extremely slow, 1^• 'V.E' Day fell during the period under review but it can scarcely be said to have caused any considerable stir among the loc-l population, there were mild demonstrations inthe streets but the local Fer&amp;ians had mentally calculated Day long before it arrived. This same attitude governs their ceactions towards propoganda. There are some who contend that the Persians made up their minds long ago that t* the Allies would win the war therefore it was waste of time and money preaching to the converted. Shiraz has a reading room whi ?/hich is fairly well frequented by idlers, it broadcasts news from loudspeakers. It arranges window displays and publicity material, it provides a counter for the sale of English and other publications, it handles films and newsreels, it doles out articles for the local press but one may well doufet whether the organisation in its present form has not outlived its usefulness and whether films, books Journals and newspapers might not now be handled in purely commercial circles, the distribution of press articles remain with the consulate and the cultural activities that remain be taken over by the British Oouncil. In view of the remoteness of the war in the 'Par East and of the complete lack of Persian interest in these operations it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep alive the daily news summary distributed by the Consulate. 16. The British Institute in Shiraz has made excellent progress and would make still more if it could expand its premises and obtain more United Kingdom staff. 1? . The American Advisers have not had a very hapr^y passage. The Military Adviser left for the United States in June and has not been replaced. The Province has seen two American financial Advisers both of whom have been entirely in the hands of their rascally interpreters.. The first adviser was commonly held to be not only in the hands of but also &amp;and in glove with his interpreter. 18. The number of British officers in the province has declined rapidly. Only one is now employed on grain collect ion, and it is understood that his retention in ^hiraz is merely a matter v of administrative convenience connected with his impendingdemobllisation. The officer attached to the road transport department and both the liaison officers have gone and only two'junior Intelligence Corps officers remain. It looks as if the consulate in Shiraz will soon revert to its pre-war establishment of Consul one Indian Fro-Consul and one Persian translator and that its work and influence and its grasp of the local situation will be proportionately reduced. ! 19 The period under review ended with the three leading figures of Ears all flying at one another's throaths or at least % avam ul Mulk and Hasir qashqai flying at the throat of the Governor-General. The fact remains however that the spring migration of the tribes passed entirely without incident security was well assured, progress was made in the material welfare of the province and the activities of ^avam ul Mulk did not provoke the Hessians to intervene in Fars on a scale greater than that of their existing assistance to the virtually negligible local Tudeh Party. Shiraz Consular Diary apart, the affairs of ITars have scarcely received mention in any summary or review that deals with Persia and this fact is its own comment on situation. 3d/ E.G. J jenrs British Consulate, Shiraz, July 25th, 1945.BRITISH CONSULATE, SHIRAZ Appreciation of local conditions, July to December, 1946. The last six months of 1945 saw a change of holder in the post of Governor-General of Fars. General Firuz who had left Shiraz for Tehran in June last rather than stand up to his opponents sat in the capital for some months apparently in the hope that these same opponents would ask him to come back. They were unrepentant and after the names of many possible successors had been mentioned Firuz was replaced towards the end of December by Farrukh, Immediately prior to his appointment to Shiraz Farrukh had been appointed Governor-General in Tabriz but did not proceed to this post as he was unacceptable to the Russians# 2. Qavam ul Mulk had been the chief opponent of Firuz and it was now the turn of the Qashqai to come froward as chief opponents of Farrukh. They declared objection to Farrukh was that he was hasty- tempered. But they also saw in him a survival of the Pahlevi regime (he previously served under Pahlevi as Gbvernor-rGeneral of Fars) and a further objection was that Farrukh was a friend of Muadel, the Shiraz deputy who is a particular enemy of Khosru Qashqai, Opposition to Farrukh was general and not limited to the Qashqai and his appointment is said to have been at the insistence of the Shah. Farrukh is said to be able and honest but rough in his handling of people. 3. The arrival of Farrukh coincided with a serious deterioration of the position in Azerbaijan so that the end of the year saw Qavam and the consulate attempting to persuade the Qashqai that it was in the interests of Persia that Farrukh, whom they wanted to chase away, should stay and thus give the Russians no opportunity of saying that there was unrest in Fars as well as in Azerbaijan. Behind the Qashqai objections to Farrukh lies their ambition to be the Warwicks of Fars. 4. The absehce of a Governor-General for more than six months had a serious effect on the administration particularly from the point of view of grain collection and distribution of monopoly goods. Already before the withdrawal of the last British officer seconded for grain collection landlords were refusing to sign fresh contracts for deli veries from the next harvests and even to honour contracts signed for deliveries of grain from the last harvest, Shiraz, in consequence started the winter with an empty silo and nothing better than hand- to-mouth arrangements to ensure the supply of bread to the town, 5. Continued scandals marked the administration of the department responsible for the distribution of monopoly goods and embraced an inspector specially sent down from Tehran to enquire into the situat ion. Distribution of monopoly goods was grossly defective and generally months in arrear. 6. The newspaper aeditor appointed as Mayor by General Firuz from outside the usual cadre in the hope, that a local man would study local interests and please the populace soon became the object of complaints that went as far as the Imperial Court and legal proceedings were commenced against him. The fact that he was penniless when he took over the job and at the end of the year was building himself a new house was, even if no other evidence existed, weighty evidence against him. The Municipality remained behindhand in payment of wages, in debt, without a budget and apparently unable to get funds even for essential services. 7. The lack of a Governor-General had very much less effect on the armed forces than on the civil administration. In fact as Firuz / was a...was a Major-General his departure freed the commanders of the Army and Gendarmerie from the restraint that his higher rank placed upon them. 8. Brigadier Khosrudad who commands the Gendarmerie is a rogue but doubtless no worse than any other Persian officer similarly placed (it is said in his excuse that he is constantly subject to pressure to send greater and greater pickings to Tehran). From j our point of view he has the advantage of being pleasant to deal with and apparently anxious to co-operate. The tribes 1 objection to him is that he has been in Fars so long that he knows not only all the ropes but all the tricks as well. 9. In colonel Himmat the army has an officer of ability, out standing honesty and devotion to his duties and a reputation for courage in the field. His extensive knowledge and experience of Fars and of its tribes stand him in good stead. There is an armed truce between him and the Qashqai but the tribes without exception speak of Himmat with respect. ■ ■&gt; Brij 1 i 10. The Qashqai in particular stood to gain by the general pardon of the tribes in Fars announced by the Shah but the effect of this act of clemency was overshadowed by the turn of events in the north. io rsdfwJ S3 71 : 11. The Khamseh, who are the smaller of the two larger groups of U ' . _ • v • -m 1 1 -I -I 1 1 J TT^ J ^ J — ^ ^ ^ 4 ^ obs : Ur t ruUrn ■■oi i snsv' tribes in Fars, have been well-behaved. Under their new supervisor, the Governor of Fasa,(a relative of Qavara ul Mulk) their conditions ' !f l n of life and general outlook have improved. By this good handling of Khamseh affairs the Supervisor has built himself such a reputation that he claims he could disarm and settle the Khamseh without any : o 9rii: difficulty. It is a pity that the Government are unable or not sufficiently interested to produce the money tb cover the cost of ^ i settling the Khamseh and so not only make a start in tackling the ' ^ question of the migratory tribes but also make it sagaciously. The Khamseh are not rich enough to settle themselves. Qavam ul Mulk •do t pi might be induced to put up the necessary money but the objection . to turning to Qavam for assistance is that it would strengthen the hold on the tribe that he has particularly been able to resume through the appointment and good work of the supervisor. 19 gliOI'K' i: 12. The Qashqai, who are the other main tribal group in Fars, but - greater and richer than the Khamseh, have had their loyalty to their o' 'oJ leader, Nasir Khan Qashqai, assailed but managed to maintain it unimpaired. The first attack on Naser's position came from his uncl^ All Khan, his uncle's two sons Shengiz and Amir Mansur and 9 r from the sons of another uncle., Sardar Ehtesham. These severally i. went out in tribal country but seem to have enlisted little or no support and so could whip up no real challenge to Naser ! s authority. But Naser, who, wrongly attributed their activities to spurrings from the Government and from Seyyed Zia seems to have been sufficiently moved to consider buying them off. 13. A second and much more serious challenge to his position arose from Nase^s sending an impetuous telegram to the Prime Minister saying that in disgust at the Governments suppression of newspapers, parties, associations and freedom in general he renounced his leader ship of the Qashqai. Naser's telegram gave the general impression . that he had gone over to the Russians because the newspapers and parties suppressed were Tudeh. But -the later corrected this impress ion and quickly changed his mind about leading the Qashqai when his uncle All Khan said he would assume charge in Naser's place. Naser was obliged to beat up the kalantars to wire Tehran to say that they would have none other than him. His telegram was a further source of embarrassment to Naser when the situation in Azerbaijan started boiling up and he was then at some pains to convince Tehran of his loyalty. 14. In general the conditions of the Qashqai show improvement. / TheR- - 3 - i- u ! , . J [U 1 The consulate has lost no opportunity of urging the Qashqai to settle and the summer of 1946 saw 500 more Darrehshuri families settling permanently in the summer quarters thus making a total there of 1,000^ families, Naser Khan, who is building a school in Firuzabad, put the public bath there in working order and proposes to build a hospital, has produced a plan for large scale settlement at Baigan on the Firuzabad plain 10 miles from Firuzabad, He has been strongly encouraged to go ahead with this plan. 16., Naser Khan overcame his fears and presented himself to the Shah in July thus returning to Tehran for the first time since he fled from the detention in which the Shah ! s father placed him, 16. The remaining tribal groups in Fars, the Mamassani and Doshmanziari, have kept quiet. Hossein Qoli JRostam who leads the Mamassane seems to have few friends and to be lacking in the sincerity that makes friends. He has however managed to keep the Qashqai off his lands. 17. The Boir Ahmedi, who only partially come into the provincial .picture, have maintained their reputation as thieves and raiders and at one period penetrated as far as the Isfahan- Shiraz road near Abadeh. The Gendarmerie took appropriate steps in the general and the Darrehshuri took steps in their own interest with the result that the Boir Ahmedi withdrew. Apart from this incident and a short break in the early summer (attributable to the absence of a Governor-General) security on the roads has been well maintained. 18. Relations of the province with Tehran have not improved. The Shah, who has only once been to Fars and seems to mean little or nothing to the people of the province has lost ground over his matrimonial affairs, Tehran Governmentrs in general are accused of neglecting Fars. Lar which is still a fine town and has architectu rally one of the best bazaars in Persia has b&lt;5en slowly dying for years and no move seems to be made to save it. Now the rot has started in Shiraz. A number of the richer merchants have gone to Theran to live finding that with the increasing centralization of affairs in Tehran they must be in the capital if they are to survive. Currency control and the accentuates this desertion of the provinces and gradually all the wealth of the country seems to be collecting in the capital. It only needs ten of the biggest merchants to leave Shiraz to shake the economy of the town completely. 19. Qavam ul Mulk who followed Firuz to Tehran in September returned to Shiraz at the beginning of December, Whether it was because he had achieved his aim in ousting Firuz or because of a warning given him by the Embassy he returned apparently a much changed man. With Firuz away he tended to usurp the functions of Governor-General and to run Fars tfrom his private residence but with the worsening of the situation in the north showed wisdom, balance and calm. The Tudeh newspaper campaign which he fought before his departure for Tehran died down in his absence and on his return the one remaining Tudeh newspaper was under suppression. One of the first acts of the incoming Governor-General was to raise the ban on this newspaper. 20. Party activity has been sluggish. In August the Tudeh were ejected from Mervdasht (on the Persepolis plain) where there is a sugar-factory and had their club there gutted. With the temporary loss of their Shiraz newspapers they were not very vocal. The Adalat Party showed little sign of life. The Democrat Party (which is a conservative body and nothing to do with the movement in Azerbaijan)opened a reading room but otherwise followed its leader, a local mullah, into a state of deep depression. The Eradeh Mel.li (Seyyed Zia^ Party) started a newspaper and thennlost it because it was unwilling to pay sufficient blackmail to the owner. It h.as a snaUreading room but undertook no activerecruiting of members« k 1r Tehran. One American Military Adviser, who made ho pretence of i . loing any work, left for assignment to a battle area and his place ras taken by a colleague from Kerman who seems to regard his mission ;o regenerate the Persian Army in Fars as divine as well as American, I-: ?he American Financial Adviser terminated his employment at the end v . )f December. In one respect, by discharging a scoundrelly inter- . t • r; )reter, he showed to advantage over his predecessor but to judge by ;he number of days he was actually present in Shiraz to attend to i . lis duties the Persian Government made in him a bad bargain, &gt;2. The Public Relations Bureau reading room in Shiraz was virtually ij dosed. Only the relaying of broadcast news has been continued and ;hat in order to keep the town informed of the march of events in ;he north and thus prevent the spread of rumours likely to disturb ;he public calm. It cannot be said that the P.R.B, activities in / Ihiraz have been a striking success. The reason is that this sort )f work to be done well is a whole time job, calls for constant luropean supervision and an unfailing supply of bright ideas. In ^ ihiraz the reading room has had to make do with such attention as lembers of the consulate staff could spare it. The regular P.R.B, ■' f ;taff was engaged locally. J n.c /Igat !3. If P,R,B, activities gave little cause for satisfaction the ritish Institute has on the other hand gone from strength to strength • nd in Shiraz at least it looks as if it would have been much more f ' f ewarding to concentrate on the British Council than on P,R.B, The eneral impression given that the British Council it was short of ; r 1 oney while the P.R.B, was flush points to misplaced emphasis. The ' xpansion of the work of the British Council in Shiraz is limited 1 nly by the cramp premises available and by the number of the uropean staff employed. ni i/d ' fJ 1 The British aeroplane used for weekly flights between Tehran -i' -i; nd Bushire has given good service and could be duplicated with ,) .-vtv pofit. o noil tss ? .. ■ , ' J !6. There has been occasianal criticism of the A.I,0,C, in the ocal press chiefly because stocks of primary products have been in )0 v thort supply and in consequence there has been no opportunity or ;erious attempt made to provide for the needs of outlying areas. If luring the war the first care of the A,I .G .C. was to attend to the illied fighting services one of the first cares of the peace should )e to study the local market. Fars is a province that has suffered 7 4 rom severe deforxeatktion and every year brings a crisis in fuel, ;t is here that the Company should make an effort to substitute oil 'or the diminishing charcoal and wood stocks. In Shiraz only bakers, md not all of these, regularly use oil as fuel. The bakers find . :he necessary equipment is expensive and difficult to obtain so the ,/ t , ;ampnay might well in Ihe public as well as their own interest make irrangements to supply bakers 1 outfits on reasonable terms. They . light also produce stoves suitable for use in Government departments, jchools, baths and private houses and so increase the consumption of , )il and reduce the demand for wood and charcoal,.Some charcoal will ilways be consumed for domestic purposes but a drive on the part of the company to supply oil-buring domestic, appliances seems much overdue, tKxsxxixi^iatxEfxtkKXKBmxaHyixxfaiiiixjsxtjExiKlazRxt as is also the ') ^igorouss devdopment -and local sale of by-products.

Greatly dis- -couraged eventually with the ineptitude of his Government he resigned in July. On the 13th October Aqai Mehdi Shahrukh wag sent to Kerman as Ustandar and he remained in office for the remainder of the year, Aqai Fazlulah Bahrami eHjoyed great popularity owing to the energy a nd initiative he displayed in his attempts to provide amenities for the public^ for his strenuous efforts to encourage the development of the local coal seams in Kuh Badumu; for his great solicitude for the poor and destitute whom he help- -ed in a practical way by arranging to supply them food and other essentials at special reduced prices during the winter. He was an honest and efficient official and a great loss to the province, (^) Farmandar , On the 7th February Aqai Vosuq, an In- -spector of the Ministry of the Interior who was carrying out the duties of the Farmandar, was summoned to Tehran and re lieved by A qai isfandiari (Adl us-Sultaneh), the ex-farmandar of Kermansha h. When Aqai Fazlulah Bahrami left for Tehran on the 22nd May A qai Isfandiari was acting Ustandar in addition to his own duties until the 13th October on which date Aqai Mehdi Shahrukh a ssumed charge. (c) Sconomic and Finance Department . Hr,D,F,Tribonn held the post of Director General of Finance, Kerman, from the beginning of the year until the 26th July when, for reasons of health, he resigned his appointment and l^ft for Tehran. On the 20th Jan ary he received instruc- -tions from Tehran limiting his economic powers to the collect- -ion of opium and income ta x, Aqai Hussain Ali Farzan was then appointed as Hasi-i-Kharbar (Head of the Sconomic Department) who dealt w ith the distribution of monopoly goods, i,e, tea, sugar, cloth, cigarettes and grain collection, Aqai Hassan Imami wa s appointed as Director of Finance but owing to disagreement with Mr.Tribonn he was instructed by the latter to proceed to Tehran on the 21st April after which Aqai Jabbari was appointed to officiate for the rest of the year in the collection of opium and income tax, ( d ) Agricultural Department . A qai Sheikh ul Islami was Head of the Agricultural Department throughout the year. The exceptionally good rainfall at the beginning of the year promised a good wheat crop but the authorities state that the late frost at the end of March followed by 'sen' (rust) caused some damage. There is reason, however, to believe that the harvest wa s abuve average. Cotton^ The cotton crop was reported to have been good but the price of this commodity dn the open market effectively placed it out of reach of the ordinary man. In July the Government con- -trol oi cotton was lifted. As the demand for cotton remains it is ppected that larger areas will be devoted in the future to its cultivation. p ri li -r 1 J S8./- l Qpi\m&gt; The opium crop was not below normal but the Finance Department were able to collect only 4,800 kilos during the year which was 2000 kilos less than the amount collected the previous year. It is said that this was due to the visits of a succession of Inspectors sent from Tehran to assess the opium crop, taking their 'rake off*. The Gov- -ernment purchased pure opium from cultivators at Tomans 1000/- per 5 kilos and after adulterating it sold it to the public at Tomans 2000/- per 3 kilos. All pistachio trees were severely damaged by the frost and great loss was suffered by cultivators. The price of pistachios rose from Rials 60/-&gt;er maund to Rials 280/- at which level it remained more or less throughout the year. Over 20% of the entire fruit crop was also damaged from the same cause. Locusts . Between March and June large swarms of locusts were reported to have settled in Rudbar,Jiruft, Baft, Narmshir, Bam and other wa rm areas in which hoppers appeared later. The anti-locust unit stationed at Bandar Abbas took necessary meas ures to combat it and Aqai Fazlulah Bahrami, the Ustandar, appealed to all landowners affected to cooperate in destroying the hoppers a nd the summer crop was effectively saved from damage from this cause. (e) Education Department . Dr.Muzaffar Baqai was Director of Education,Kerman, from Janua ry until the 16th July when he proceeded to Tehran on leave. Aqai Ahmad Ahra m, who since April had been sent by the Ministry of Education to inspect the work of the Department in the 8th Ustan, officiated in his absence until the 25th Sep- -tember when he was recalled to Tehran and relieved by Aqai RarfrirayyKgyanrawt Ali Naqi Bahmanyar. On the 22nd October Aqai Rahbar Ka srawi a rrived from Tehran in the capacity of Head of the Education a nd Waqf Department and held charge of the appoint- -ment until the end of the year. Whilst Dr.Baqai was directing the affairs of the Education Department he had serious differences with Aqai Afzal Roohi (brother of Aqai Ataulla h Roohi, deputy for Kerman) whom he a ccused of mismanagement of Waqf properties and of not co- -operating with him. Aqai Roohi was suspended as a result, by Aqai Ahram, but was reinstated shortly after through the in- -fluence of his brother the deputy. Dr.Baqai was then recalled to Tehran and finally retired from the service of the Department in September. In addition to the six primary schools established last year in the province ten additional primary schools were opened in Bam, Sirjan, Zerend, Bandar Abbas and Rafsinjan. Of 10,274 boys and girls in the Primary and Sec ondary schools of the Ustan 4596 are in Kerman , and suburbs. In the entire Ustan there are now 34 Night Schools with 54 classes of which 11 are in Kerman. The total number of students attending these classes ia 1010 of whom 381 are in Kerman. During the year a Teachers* Training School to instruct pupils up to the 4th Primary Class was opened at Bam and Bandar A bbas. The young men and women who pass out are sent to outlying villages and towns. The former Kerman Primary Norma 1 S chool has been converted into a boarding school and accomodates 58 students.9./- (f) Agricultural Bank , Aqai Syed Jawad Moinzadeh held the post of Manager of the Agricultural Bank, Kerman, throughout the year. During the year a sum of one million rials was loaned to landowners and cultivators to help them build 'qanats 1 and to purchase agricultural equipment etc. The major portion of the money loaned was given to landowners of Bam and the remainder to the Khawanin-i-Xbrahimi, Kerman. The rate of interest was 6% in addition to 4fe% known a s 1 karmuzd•• Owing to financial stringency the amount placed at the disposal of the Bank was far short of the needs of agriculturists many of whose requests for loans had to be rejected. (g) Department of Justice . Aqai Suleiman Zia f Ibrahimi officiated as Chief Judge of the Court of Justice as well as Chief Judge of the Court of Appeal until the 21st September after which he was relieved by Aqai Akhgar who held the post until the end of the year. Aqai Ali Akbar Tawakuli was the Public Pro- -secutor in the Court of Appeal from January until the 22nd October when he proceeded on leave to Tehran. Aqai Kkwaja Na siri officiated until the end of the year. Aqai Imad Mansuri officiated as Chief Judge of the C^urt of First Instance until the 13th Dscember after VKhich Aqai Ja lali relieved him until the end of the year. , Aqai Qawami was Public Prosecutor in the C2&gt;urt oflFirst Instance from the beginning of the year until the 22nd December a fter which Aqai Forugh took charge until the end of the year. (h) Police . Captain Histamati acted as Chief of Police from the beginning of the year until the 24th September when Sa rhang Hormoz Givian took over from him and held charge until the end of the year. Captain Hishmati though quite a junior officer discharged his duties conscientiously in the face of many difficulties. He was cooperative and friendly with this Consulate. Salihang Givian, formerly a military officer, was transferred to the Police Department in Tehran before his a ppointment in Kerman. He has not shown any outstanding qualities so far but is helpful and friendly. I»i December the local police force was aug- -mented by 40 new members recruited locally. The system of registering the names of all persons entering and leaving the town was reintroduced during the year. (i) Posts and Telegraphs . Aqai Ahmad Sadri, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, remained in cha rge up to the 23rd April when he proceeded on leave to Tehran. His relief, Aqai Mustafa14^ by a gang of ariaed Baluchis on 'tiie 24'th November and goods a nd money valued at about tomans 18,000/- were carried away. r ' All, a notorious bandit of the Kerman area ^ e P or ^ e ^ have been killed in November by riflemen of Bahadur ul Mulk a t i^ardsir. ^cember, Jamshid the son of Shamshir (known as Da h ^ir} the leader of a band of Buchakchis, was caught by the military authorities near Mashiz with one of his follow- -°ers # Allahyar who was with them was killed in trying to escape. 61 , ^ In Novemb ?r an Iranian soldier named Manuchir died on him in Kerman by two members of the Agricultural Department named Khalaqi and Zand.

The G.O.C in- -sisted on seeing him in person before considering any terms• Murad Ali did not obey the G # O.C f s summons but in earnest of his good intentions sent the G,O.C, six obsolete a nd ung^able rifles stating that he would surrender more after final settlement of his case. Meanwhile the G .o;c # decided that further discussions was futile and he immedi- -a tely returned to Kerman to organise a punitive expedition a gainst Mura d. Before the G.O.C. left, Murad is reported to have threatened to revert to brigandage if his case were not s ettled within five days* Some days later the G .o .C. sent several companies of infantry and cavalry to Sirjan to round up Mura d Ali and his followers. When Sarhang Hatemi reached the neighbourhood of Bardsir he made contact with Murad f s party. They offered no resistance but were reported to have fled in a southerly direction to a mountain named Kuh-i-Khersak about 10 miles from Balvard east of Sirjan where they made a stand. Murad's men were said to be in possession of about 50 Brno rifles and 2 light machine guns. Hatemi followed and succeeded in surrounding the mountain with two companies of infantry, one squadron of cavalry and a strong mortar section. After a brisk action with no casual- -ties on either side Hatemi a ppears to have let Murad es- -caoe. But he gave out that Murad had fled in a westerly direction towards Fars. On the 17th July Murad was actually to the north of Sirjan to see if there was any chance of buying off the military. Later, however, well authenticated reports showed that the G .o .C's brother contacted Murad Ali who agreed to pay him Rials 100,000/- amd to leave the dis- -trict for a place between iiafsinjan and Yezd if the military would call off operations. Murad T s men then got busy ^ol- -lecting 1 the rials 100,000/- from local landowners and pea- -sants who ha d already suffered financially by 'entertaining 1 Sha'ri and the military. Colonel Hatemi is also reported to have acquired a quantity of carpets, and other valuables from village headmen in return for not accusing them of collaboratirg with Murad. As a final act in the comedy it was reported that the G.O.O, offered to sell Murad the ammunition said to have been expended against him a t Rials 140/- per round. This to- -gether with spurious bills for petrol consumed, rations, wear and tear of eq uipment, rounded off what must have been a most lucrative expedition. Since then to the end of the year no further news of Murad was received. The following are the outstanding cases of robberies, violence and captures etc. which occurred during the year, 1. Aqai Farzan whilst proceeding to Bandar Abbas was held up by armed robbers who put his car out of action and relieved him of Rials 50,000/- pf government money. 2. Bandits on the Bandar Abbas road held up an Iranian postal truck on the 16th January at Jal-i-Mohammad Khan. The truck was carrying a million and a half rials of government money in bank notes. The bandits drove the truck six miles off the road and decamped with all the cash. Later evidence showed that they had previous knowledge of the money the &gt; lorry was carrying. At the end of March, however, the gen— -darmerie recovered about Rials 750,000/— 3. On the 17th January seven Buchakchis looted the village of Muzaffar Abad of Sirjan. This was believed to have been a reprisal raid by Murad Ali for the hanging of his father in law. 4^ In the first half of May a report from Bam stated that14./- @ dU&amp;ii that about SO miles from Deh Sheikh Jawad Sahib Ikhtiary, the Financial Agent, Baft, and others including one gen- -darme, were held up by Fars 1 robbers. In the engagement which followed one of the bandits was killed and two cap- -tured, together with a large number of sheep which they had recently stolen^ On the 25rd May a gang of about 25 armed robbers attacked Shabjereh, a village near Zerend, containing about 2,500 inhabitants. They looted as much cash and valuables as they were a ble to carry away. One of the gang was wound- -ed by gendarmes , who pursued them, and brought into Kerman. At the end of May about 45 robbers attacked Soorghan, 21 miles from Daulatabad near Oorzieh and decamped with valuables. They also kidnapped 3 women and a child as host- -ages. The gendarmes, in the pursuit which followed, kill- -ed 6. of the robbers and rescued the hostages. 7. Mohammad Hassan Afshar (Khabri) a notorious robber of the Baft area was granted an amnesty 3 years ago by the Gov- -ernment and ordered to come into Kerman. He failed to do so at the time but in June he tried to enter the town unobtrus ively to make priva te purchases. The Military authorities came to know of his presence in the town and arrested and im- -prisoned him. It was reported that the G.O.C. later accept ed Rials 100,000/- from the four brothers of Afshar in return for his release. m a. Marsha lal Khani, who for some time had been respon sible for several armed robberies and murders in the outlying villages of Kerman was caught by the military authorities and sentenced to dea th. He was hanged on the 5th July and 5 of his accomplices received various terms of rigorous imprison- -ment. 9. On the 21st August Dr.Naimi, a relation of Naim-ul- Mulk, a deputy of the Majlis, was murdered in Bam by four men in Baluch dress. Two of the.1 alleged assailants were arrested. 0 ne of them was Aqai Rafii, son of the deputy for Bam. The wife of the deceased, a daughter of Syed Nizam, who is a wealthy landlord of Bam, originally promised to marry Rafii's son and the jea lousies aroused culminated in the murder. The case?was still under hearing at the end of the year. 10. Ghulam Abbas Zadeh and his son Panj Ali who were responsible for numerous armed robberies in the outlying districts of Kerman were captured in September by Capt. Mirhussaini, a military officer, about 60 miles from Kerman, Eight rifles in their possession were confiscated and they were put up for trial in a military court. 11. On the 5th October in his residence near Darwaze Na siriyeh. Fa riboze Nasimi, a Zorastrian of Yezd, was rudely awakened by two masked robbers armed with swords who demanded his money. They had come to know that he had real ised Rials 40,000/- a few days before from the sale of his fa rm products. 0 n being given Rials 3,000/- they severely ma Itreated him and decamped with the household silver and the victim f s clothes. 12. In November, some local butchers on their way to Zerend to buy sheep were attacked by robbers and relieved of tomans 10,000/-. 13. A carava n on the Bardsir-Nigar road was held up by14. by a gang ot armeQ.

The bread made in government bakeries which sold at approximately Rials 3.50 per kilo very often contained less that 50^ of wheat and only the very poorest elements of the population consumed it. Free bakeries flourished and charged Rials 7/- per kilo. The distribution of tea and sugar was invariably made several months late - the outlying districts receiving only a fraction of their quota. In fact reports, confirmed by an independent source, stated that the Head of the local Kharbar Department sold 60 bags of sugar and 5 cases of tea in Sirjan at black market rates. Throughout the year no cloth was distributed to coupon holders. Owing to a long standing 'ramp* between local officials and merchants large quantities of ^hee 1 were being exported to other provinces and the local price fluct uated between Rials 270/- and Rials 360/- per 3 kilos for the greater part of the year. For several months in the middle of the year the price of rice rose steeply from Rials 38/- to Rials 60/- per 3 kilos and the prices of most foodstuffs and consumer goods remained at inflation levels throughout the year. There has been no appreciable difference in prices since the cessation of hostilities in Europe and the Far East The price of firewood and charcoal stood at Rials 450/- per kharva r in the last three months of the year. £» POLITICAL .. Throughout the year relations both official and social, of local officials, military authorities and notables with this Consulate continuef/to be most cordial. The hope wa s often expressed by many Persians that the freedom of social intercourse with foreigners, re-born during this War, will not be denied to them in the years to follow. The la st vestiges of pro-German sympathies dis appeared during the year and V.E.Day was celebrated with remarkable vigour by all, and brought warm-hearted and sin- -cere congra tulations from the Governor General and most of the lea ding citizens of the town. V.J.Day was also an occasion for rejoicing in which the military authorities took a leading pa rt. The celebrations were not unmixed with the hope of trade revival and years of peace and plenty. The Russian Consul General for Meshed accompanied by 3 members of his staff passed through Kerman in June. They roamed a round the town taking photographs; tried to locate the site of the old Russian Consulate; asked about17./- la. the policy of tixe British Consulate; wanted to know how many- British subtests resided in Kerman and whether they were popular with the locals^ and made general trade enquiries etc. In whispered tones they also asked whether the British military authorities had constructed any fortifications on the surrounding hills* Later on in the year, in November, the Russian Consular A gent at Zabul visited Bam and amongst other things asked the Farmandar a number of questions about culti- -vation in that area and the farmers' share of crops# For the latter half of the year public interest was focussed on Russian actions in Azerbaijan which caused them grave anxiety. In September A qai Ayatulla h, the chief local mullah, who wa s greatly venerated not only in Kerman but in many parts of the country, died at the age of 74. During his life- -time he was always a most stabilising influence, especially in times of crises between local factions. With his passing this Consulate lost a most staunch a nd loyal friend. In October A qai Hassan Ibrahimi, the Mukhtar ul Mulk and hea d of the Ibrahimi family, died at the age of 70. M. Propaganda, There were 23 P.R.B.Reading Rooms maintained through out the year in Kerma n, Yezd and the outlying towns and vil- -lages of this Consulate area. Publicity material received from the Public Rela tions Bureau and Indian, which included a diversity of magazines, pamphlets, newspapers and books etc. in Persia n, English a nd French, were regularly distributed to a 11 Reading Rooms about 4 times a month, including a daily news bulletin which was greatly sought after by readers in outlying villages. Display of photographic build-ups proved to be an additiona 1 attraction to the public. Journals and maga zines etc. for free distribution were regularly circulated amongst government officials and notables throughout the year and papers and ma ca zines for sale were sold through the agency of booksellers and others. Consula te Mobile Ginema . Throughout the year the mebile cinema gave 85 cimema shows of which 46 were given outside Kerman. Market squares and other suitable places where large crowds congregate were chosen for the shows. Each programme lasted for about an hour and a ha If and consisted of about 8 well assorted films in cluding news reels, short comics a nd feature films. In the larger towns these shows invariably attracted an average of about 1500 to 2000people, all of whom appeared to have derived the grea test enjoyment from them. Special shows were given for the benefit of schools, and the military authorities, which was grea tly appreciated. In the outlying villages where the peo ple had never in their lifetime seen a 1 talkie film', the en- thusia sm and interest was intense. Owing to post-war economies 21 Reading Rooms were closed, in November with the euiception of one in Kerman and one in Yezd, but the Mobile Cinema in still in operation. The India n Teachers of English in Kerman and Yezd have been doing their best to attract students to their classes during the year but the response, for various reasons, which have been reported separately, has not been as good as it might have been.ITT. I. Co nsular Sub^Office . Mr,Ma qbul Rahman was Clerk in Charge of the Yezd Consular Sub-0 ffice from the beginning of the year until 30th September when Mr.Abdur Rahman took over from him and held charge until the end of the year. II. VISITORS, During the year 32 British sub ects, 11 Indians. 15 Americans, 5 Russians, 2 Poles, 4 Swiss and 2 German Jews passed through Yezd. Hit BRITISH INTRRF.STS, Mr # Abdul Rahim Kotal held charge of the A.I.O.C.Depot during the year together with its sub-branches at Ardikan a nd Taft. IW. L OCAL GO VEHNMENT . Aqai Anmad Sadri held change of the post of Farmandar throughout the year. He owed his position entirely to the support of Dr. lahiri, &gt; de puty for Yezd, He is a most unpopular and cor- -IPupt official witii a strong anti—British bias and in August went so far as to instruct government officials to avoid association with members of the Consular Sub-Office. A new municipal octroi tax of xiials 2/- and .60/- wa s imposed on tea and sugar respectively on the 23rd October for the improvement of roads and sanitation both of which continue to be neglected. No important changes occurred during the year, wa s repouti^ that under Russian pressure S arhang Mukhtari, C hief of Police, Isfahan, accompanied by the Chief of the Investigation Department, Isfahan, visited Yezd in November to enquire into the causes which led to the burning of the Tudeh premises in Yezd. The Farmandar told them that it was merely a flare up between opposing factions in Yezd and that it ha d no political backgroung. Naib Sarhang Jafar Khan Sharifi, the Chief of Police was suddenly recalled to Tehran on the 5th January and Captain Sharifi wa s sent.in May to take charge, to the great relief o f the population. Gk ptain Ezadi was Officer Commanding the Gendarmes. SBCURITy- In Ma y, several cases of lawlessness occurred, part- cicularly in the south and south western parts of Yezd district where raiding gangs were holding up travellers. They extended their operations to the close proximity of the town itself and burglaries increased to an ala rming extent'later. Investiga tions showed that in some cases the gendarmes themselves were committing burglaries and that they were hand in glove with P 1 ®. roD ^ ers ' August four automobiles were held up near Taft by robbers armed with Brno rifles and the passengers were relieved ot about Romans 10,000/-. In September armed bandits U L a P assen g? r lorry near Shahr-i-Ba bak but as the onlv rifle they ha d failed to function they were overpowered bv the passengers and brought into Yezd and handed over to the police! ia./.19./- ia. In the sa me month armed robbers looted the occupants of a ©a r nea r Abdulmalik - about 12 miles from Yezd on the main Kerma n road a nd seriously injured one of them. In a cla sh between the Gendarmerie and bandits near Mehri^. one robber was shot dead and 2 others who were wounded escaped. In November bandits attacked a caravan on the Ba fq road and got a wa y with most of their loot. Three lorries loaded with sugar and tea were robbefil by bandits on the Yezd-Shiraz road 53 miles from Yezd in December and the loot was carried away into the interior. Only a few bags were recovered by the genda rmerie and the road wa s considered unsa fe in December. m. ecq:nomig&gt; Conditions were much the same as in Kerman, In August, the local Kharbar D epa ^ment announced that there was no further need for government bakeries and recommended that 90 tons of wheat a nd 480 tons of barley held in their 'ambars 1 should be sold by public auction. By November no purchasers had come forward for the barley. When the Azerbaijan trouble wa s at its height a n artificia 1 scarcity of wheat was ere- -a ted by leading mercha nts who hoarded the bulk of their stocks. Under the pretence of solicitude for the poor, who were in serious difficulties owing to this development, the hoa rders themselves conferred with the Farmandar and after prolonged discussions decided to a ppeal to Tehran to in- -struct Isfahan to end Yezd 1000 tons of wheat immediately, Mea nwhile the public were receiving bread from the barley which the Kharbar Department were unable to sell. Tea was distributed at very irregular-intervals and suga r supplies for Yezd d.nd district were 9 months overdue at the end of the year. No cloth had been distributed throughout the year. When government control of cotton was lifted the price of cotton yearn rose from Rials 450/- to Rials 520/- per bun- -dle of 10 lbs. Prices of most consumer goods and foodstuffs had risen at the end of the year by about 20&lt;£ over prices prevailing ea rlier. vii. local politics , As the result of alleged discrimination in Yezd, by the late Farmandar Sadri, in selecting an Electoral Committee for the Provincia 1 Council, he was recalled to Tehran and replaced by Aqai Ismail Baha dur who is reported to be distinctly pro- H ussian. In January, the Tudeh Party in Yezd under the leadership of A bbas Ustadan, a local lawyer, increased its activities and, under pressure from him, the owners of the Durakshan and Herati Mills were compelled to sanction a temporary increase of 55^ in the wa ges of their workers and to reduce the hours of working from 12 to 10 daily. The management of the Iqbal Mills did not, however, a ccede t to these damands. On the 6th Ja nuary Ustadan ordered the workers of all three mills to cea se work and they closed down. The following day an anti- -Tudeh party associa ted with Dr.Tahiri, the deputy, broke into the premises of the Tudeh and set it ablaze. Ustadan who es- -ca ped was atta eked later on and badly manhandled and he left19u for Tehran a few days after. In the meant line a Russian military ofiicer, under the guise of an inspector of Iran- Sov-Trans (a Russian transport company), paid a surreptitious visit to Yezd a nd contacted sympathisers there. Shortly after, a Russian motor mechanics who had had a well esta blished workshop and gara ge in Isfahan for 10 years gave up his lucrative business to settle in Yezd in the same busi- -ness, with his wife and two childsen* In September two more Russian motor mechanics arrived and settled in Yezd, which is already well served in this respect, and established motor repa ir workshops* All the Russians have contact with two prominent Russia n muhajirs who are on terms of intimacy with every prominent^ government officia 1 and notable in Yezd. They seem to have plenty of money and pay their assistants well. After a protracted absence in Tehran Ustadan suddenly returned to Yezd in August but set up his Party»s offices in Ardikan where he disseminated his creed amongst the peasants in the surro un( ^ n S districts. After collecting a large number or:, supporters amongst- them he opened a bookshop in Yezd at which communists propaganda material was sold. At the end of the ye^r prepa rations for re-opening the Tudeh Party branch office in Yezd- were wll a dvanced. His Ma Jesty^ Consul, Kerman.CHAPTHm V CONFIDEN T IAL .

Due to the various restrictions imposed by the central authorities in Tehran and the lack of shipping space, the volume of trade has remained very low. The bulk of imports being from the Trucial Coast. Trade with India was small. Exports comprised in main of carpets to America and Attari and Dates to the Trucial Coast and Oman. Products from the hinterland are no longer being despatched to Bandar Abbas for shipment and this has caused a marked decline in the export trade. ANfiTiQ-TRANTAN QI.L-££MPANI The A.I.O.C. continued to function throughout the year. Imports of petrol, Kerosene and lubricating Oil were heavy. Approximately 2600 tons were sent to Kerman, Sirjan, Zahidan and Bam. MSMS GR AY MACKENZIE &amp; CO. LTD .

MUNICIPALITY . Aqai Ahmed Mosanenzadeh ex Acting Governor remained as head of the Municipality until the 26th October when he proceed ed to Tehran. Aqai Sepehrnia was appointed as Acting Head of the Municipality and continued to hold charge until the close of the period. HEALTH . But for the almost record incidence of Guinea worm, with the resulting ulcers; the year was comparatively healthier. No less than 26% of the population suffered from Guinea worm during the 2nd quarter of the year. The incidence of malaria was comparatively low Infantile diarrhoea in late summer, and pheumonia at the beginning and close of the year were responsible for some deaths. The town was praitically free from serious infections. ' INDUSTRY . The Khunji Cotton Spinning Mill continued to function day and night throughout the year. Mr. Builakh the manager of the Hormuz mines was relieved of his post by Mohandas Shirani in May, 1945, the former having proceeded to Tehran. No red oxide was mined. 1,500 tons of red oxide from the huge dump of already mined oxide was lifted in November by one of Frank Strick steamers. The affairs of the Mines Department were in a complete state of chaos by the end of the year. FISH CANNING FACTORY . The factory functioned from the beginning of the year up to the middle of June when they closed down for the summer. Production was not upto standard. At tlfce close of the year there were no signs of restarting work. ECONOMIC . Despite the cessation of hostilities, prices of essential commodities remained high and only the moderately well to do were able to obtain their daily needs. The poor lived on fish and dates. V MILITARY. ■ 1 ■ — Servan Ghaffari commanded the Garrison in Bandar Abbas throughout the year. The Garrison still maintain its detachments at oask and Minab. GENDARMERIE . The Gendarmerie has had no less than six officers during the year. Sarwan Allai vacated his post on the 13th July and his assistant Servan Pur Homayun held charge temporarily until the arrival of Servan Bayzai (3rd August). Sayzai remained in charge until the 24th September when he in turn handed over charge to Servan Shojaian. On the 2nd October Shojaian relin quished his post which was filled in by Setvan Sultan Ali Forouzandeh who in turn handed over to Serwan Khalil Pasha Salehshoor on the 8th November, 1945. Salehshoor was still in charge at the close of the period.- 4 - INTERNAL SECURITY . The state of security of the Bandar Abbas district was fairly good throughout the year. Only one robbery worthy of mention took place towards the end of January when a truck carrying cash was robbed of a box containing Rials 10,000,000. VI COMMUNICATIONS. ' ROADS. No new roads were constructed during the year. The B Bandar Abbas - Kerman road has deteriorated and as a result requires extensive and costly repairs. Other roads exist to Minab and Tar, but these are barely practicable for motor traffic. Elsewhere animal transport alone is possible. VII SHIPPING Steamers with an aggregate of 170757 tons gross entered and cleared the port of Bandar Abbas during 1945. This tonnage does not include A.I.O.C. tugs. The distribution was as follows.

THE POLITICAL AGENCY . Personnel ( a ) Ivir. G.N. Jackson M.B.E., of the Indian Political Service held charge u _p^ go the 19th April, when he proceeded to England on le ?y?: ', His was taken by Major M.P. 0^ Tandy of the Indian Political Service who held charge until the end of the year. (b) Assistant Surgeon C.E. Hynes I.M.D., held charge of the Government dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. II. THE RULING FAMILY . (a) x i or a man of sixty with a weak heart His Highness shaikh Sir Ahmea al Jabir As-Subah K.C.S.I., K.C.I .E., maintained remark ably gooa heaith throughout the year. This was probably due to his habits of^moderation in diet, of avoidance of exertion, of implicit obedience to the American Mission doctors who visit him twice weekly, and of keeping a loaded revolver to hand ^ven in the privacy^of his harem . He remained in Kuwait throughout the year except for the periodical pogroms of bustard which were committed as usual during the winter months. He did hov/ever during the summer proclaim his intention of visiting India in September for optical and dental treatment, and this proposal may have been a ballon d^essai to detect any tendency on the part of Government to accord him a reception on the lines of those given to other Arab- rulers in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. V/hen no trace of any such tend ency was apparent the proposal was allowed to droD, but a similar ballon may well be released in 1946. His Highness celebrated the 25th anniversary (by Muslim reckon ing) of his accession on the 23rd February and was suitably felicit ated by all communities, although the Government of India took no special steps to mark the occasion. By our calendar the 25th anniversary of His Highness* accession will fall on the 24th of March, 1946. (b) Shaikh Abdullah Salim G.I.E., Continued to administer the Revenue and Supply Departments with a degree of competence and probity hitherto unsuspected, and to punctuate his spells of duty with frequent (and apparently innocent) visits to his island iiaunt of Failecha. He led the exodus to the Levant caused by the untimely advent of Ramadhan in August and September and gave rise to not a little scandal by passing the sacred month congenially in the red- light quarter of Damascus. (c) Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak C.I.E., continued to supervise the Department of Public Security with rutiilessness and energy in no way diminished by his increasing weight - now in excess of 20 stone. He remains more pro-Shaikh than the Shaikh and more pro- British than the British. The result of his efforts has been an astounding degree of security throughout the town and state of Kuwait. He visited the Levant between 31st July and 6th September and returned from his first journey abroad convinced that there is no place like home. (d) Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir remained Chief^Justice and Director of Education in which posts he discharged his duties loyally and efficiently. He visited Bombay in the Spring, partly for optical treatment and partly in the hope of finding an easier cure for his hereditary disorder than the repeated and painful Salvarsan injections pr&lt;|pribed by the Mission doctors in Kuwait. in this he was unsuccessful. • (e) Shaikh Abdulla al Ahmad..(e) ^ Shaikh. Abdullah al Ahmad, who has increased if possible in adiposity, wheeziness, and geniality, remained in charge of the Arsenal - a suitable post as it does not require a high decree of mobility. (f) Shaikh Subah as Salim remained Chief of Police, (g) Shaikh Mubarak al Hamad al Mubarak remained in charge of the Customs. (h) Shaikh Mohammad al Ahmed continued to live in Basrah and to manage His Highness T property in T Iraq, but the even tenor of his existence was broken by an affray with the T Iraq Customs police in which he suffered a bullet through the neck (which should have killed him) and the loss of his right thumb. (i) Shaikh Fahad as Salim's not inconsiderable talents remain ostensibly unemployed but it is difficult to estimate the extent to which he participated in the administration of the departments officially entrusted to his brother Abdulla. ^(j) ^ Shaikh Salim al Hamud, an uncle of His Highness and the senior living member of the Subah family, succumbed to tuberculosis in a sanatorium at Beyrouth. Until the last moment it was doubt ful whether tuberculosis or diabetes would have the honour t)f carry ing him off. He leaves two sons: a boy of 18^who is accounted demented by reason of his ordinate predilection for the bottle and the opposite sex, and an infant who has been adopted by shaikh Abdullah Mubarak. III. THE POLITICAL AGENT'S RELATIONS ./ITH THE SHAIKH . The Political Agent's relations with the Shaikh remained cordial, although in warmth they varied inversely with the amount of friction generated by efforts to curtail the smuggling propen sities of Kuwaitis in the interests of war-time trade control. His Highness renewed the Civil Air Agreement for a further period of 3 years and was co-operation itself in his dealings with the R.A.F. Early in the year he offered them the use of the Quarant ine buildings at Shuwaikh rent free, as a rest-house; an offer which was gratefully accepted although itjmay conceivably have been not unconnected with a desire on the part of the Shaikh to evade the obligation to maintain a quarantine station. IV - LOCAL I BEHESTS . ■ (a) Gen eral In the absence of a published budget the administration of the State remains something of a mystery. It is however clear that the Consultative Assembly born with so many pangs in 1933 has passed away, for it held no meetings during the year. 'Progress ive' elements appear to have been too pre-occupied with their own progress in profiteering to have had time for politics. Shaikh Ahmed has retained control of the political destinies of the State and of the not inconsiderable income from the family properties in T Iraq, and continues to supervise if not to control the activities of the energetic municipality. Other State income, including apparently the oil royalties, (which amounted to approx imately £.5,000 during the year and will probably amount to over £.340,000 during 1946) was collected by the Revenue Department under the control of Shaikh Abdullah Salim. The Revenue Department paid the following approximate monthly salaries:- His Highness Rs. 4,000. Shaikh Abdulla Salim Rs. 4,000. Shaikh Abdulla Mubarak Rs. 1,500. Shaikh Fahad as Salim Rs. 1,500. ShaiKh Abdulla al Jabir Rs. 1,100.Other members of the As-Subah received from Hs.1,000 to Rs.600 monthly. d C-r i v£4 The revenue of the Customs (iividcnd from a duty of 6-| c ] q on imports and exports) and the profits of the Landing and Transport Company (which possesses a monopoly of the unloading of steamships) were divided as follows:- &lt; l 6l 'K.. Hi lANDING- COMPANY 4 ^ Revenue Department 10 % Revenue Department. /v v w j. vxijlwix u jU x l v v-xxj. v^. U \j .l. 1 fo Education ' 30 % to Share holders. 1 Jo Public Health 30 jo Education Department, . i io Municipality 30 $ Public Health. 6i ^ il) Those who administer this system remain convinced that it cannot be improved upon and have apparently not yet been confronted by the problem of an excess of revenue over expenditure. This problem is likely to arise during 1946 and the traditional solution, if applied, may h ©^ meet with opposition from those who are not given a share. (b) Medical ; 3P'W I j/' (i) The Kuwait Grovernment Medical Department Hospital remained under the supervision of the Syrian Doctor Yahya Hadidi and employed an Egyptian lady doctor during the year. Work on the new hospital remains suspended owing to lack of materials but over Rs. 1,000,000 are said to have been set aside for its completion. An excellent r- feature of the organisation is the employment of a special doctor on the health of 'Dhe school-children, all of whom are examined at regular intervals and treated if necessary. a proposal to provide one free ... meal a day in the schools had to be dropped on grounds of expence, ' ■ i (ii) Approximately 55,000 men and 28,000 women were treated as out- . patients and 581 as in-patients in the Mission Hospital. 843 operations of all sorts were performed. An interesting development is that the women of Kuwait are beginning to change their attitude -• * ' towards men doctors and have not ceased to visit the clinic since Dr. Ruth Grouse left and Dr. Gerald Nykerk took her place in February. j (iii) 5432 patients were treated in the Agency Charitable Dispensary, 1 the most common diseases being eye and digestive. • (iv) There was no general epidemic and the influenza which was pre- \ valent in 1944 did not recur. On the other hand typhoid and dysent ery was much heavier during the latter half of 1945 than in previous years, and malnutrition and tuberculosis increased considerably as a result of the high price of food. , _ 1 dj - 1 . ijp (c) Education. ; The Education Department under the direction of the capable and energetic Egyptian, Dr. Ahmed Sidiq Hamdi, continued to stand out as ei i, one of the brightest facets of the state administration, and the i, British Council representative in Cairo gave it as his opinion that the Kuwait schools compare favourably with those of Bahrain in clean liness and general organisation. There are now 10 boys t and 4 girls T schools with an attendance rol3 of 1,459 and 443 respectively. Of the 56 male teachers 12 are ■ Egyptians and 44 Kuwaitis, and'of the 21 female teachers 8 are i Egyptians, 4 Syrian, 3 Lebanese, and 6 Kuwaitis. There are a further 7 boys t schools with 300 pupils outside the town of Kuwait. During the year the Government rented a house in Zamalek, Cairo^ and furnished it at a cost of over Rs 24,000/-. The recurring cost will be about Rs 10,000/- per mensem and it will form a h8stel for the Educational Mission to Egypt which has now grown to a strength of 50 boys. Kuwait Government meet all expences except for tution fees. The ultimate object of the mission is to make Kuwait independent of foreign teachers. III &amp; Telegraphs(&lt;i) Posts &amp; Telegraphs (i) The Indian Postal Administration continued to run the post Office throughout the year. The land telegraph line to Basrah has worked satisfactorily. At present messages are only accepted and received in English. As a result of representation from His High ness the Director of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle, Karachi has been requested to instruct the 3ub-Postmaster to receive and transmit messages in Arabic. The matter has been referred by the Skitter to the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, New Delhi. (ii) Messrs Cable &amp; Wireless have continued to operate their wireless telegraph station efficiently. The automatic telephone system installed by Cable &amp; Wireless in February, 1942, is showing signs of wear and tear which has been largely due to their inability to procure necessary replacements from the United Kingdom due to war conditions. There are over 76 applicants for whom instruments are not available. (e) Municipality During the year yet another executive officer of the municipality was detected in defalcations and dismissed, but not otherwise punish ed. Executive officers are now presumed to be corrupt until the contrary is proved. (f) haj, The Saudi Government maintained the ban on the entry of persons into their territory who were not in possession of regular travel papers and the pilgrim traffic through Kuwait was consequently small. 387 people in all left for the Haj during the year out of whom 314 made the journey by camel. The lorry fare (return) was Rs.800/- per person. Gars were far more expensive: 3 Hajis hired one for Rs.10,000. (g) Pearling . Very few boats put out for the dive but those that did returned for Ramadhan with good hauls. Consequently a greater number left after Ramadhan but their catch was most disappointing. The following were the ruling prices in October:- J ewan 3heeren Golwa Bad la Naeim (h) Ship-building . Shortage of wood, particularly teak, still hampered the industry and activity was almost entirely confined to construction of boats for the Water-Supply Company. Owing to these new boats and to an unprecedented and very welcpme rain-storm in July, the usual summer water crisis did not occur. 1 i (i) The 3afar . As a result of the paucity of steamer sailings ocean-going dhows continued to prosper. 76 returned to Kuwait in the early summer and 139 left for India and Africa towards the close of the year. Y. DESERT INTERESTS Rs. 200/- per chaw. Rs; 100/- Rs. 50/- ' Rs. 15 to 20/- ' Rs. 60 to 65/- 1945 was an easier year for the bedouin than either of the pre- ceedingtwo. Rains and grazing were better and the distribution of quota goods was more efficiently and fairly organised than previously. Finally they had had time partly to adjust themselves to the use of substitutes for rice, although digestive ailments arising from the consumption of wheat cooked and milled by unorthodox and ineffective■m* - 5 - Owing largely to^ the efforts of L^-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson G.I.E., numbers of bedouin have been induced to engage in manual labour for the Kuwait Cil Company and che latter have been persuaded to put up with the waywardness and irresponsibility of bedouin employees. 71 FOREIGN INT^IlEcT S (a) oaudi Arabia Relations with the jaudi Government have remained friendly throu*! out the period under review. Every conceivable precaution is taken by the Shaikh not to offend his powerful neighbour. (b) ^ Iraq . (i) Relations with ♦Iraq have remained correct, but Kuwaitis were much inconvenienced by the new 'Iraq Visa Regulations which take no accounu of txie face that Kuwaitis, who have numerous relations and large interests in 'Iraq, have frequent occasion for visiting that country at short notice. 0 , (ii) On ohe 27th October, Shaikh Lohammad (second son of His Highness) was fired on by an T Iraqi police car a few miles to the west of Zubair while returning to Basrah from a hawking expedition. His right thumb was shot off while another bullet traversed his neck. His Mutairi guide was killed. The Mutassarraf of Basrah telegraphed his regrets to His Highness and the latter did not lodge any official protest. VII jis: DATE GARDENS. The value of the 180 shares of the Bashiya garden which were lost in 1944 has been computed at I.D.6,936.681. ' Early in the year the 'Iraq Ministries of Finance and the Interioi are said to have granted His Highness' tenants the right to cultivate the extensive mud-flats lying between His Highness' date gardens and the river 1* when this cultivation is taken in hand it will cause a very great drop in the value of His Highness' properties. Certain of the tenants have appealed against the registration of the estate in the name of His Highness and the 'Iraqi authorities have made the fact that there is an appeal pending an excuse for refusing to take action on complaints of theft or wilful damage against the tenants, 0 VIII COST OF LIVING . The cost of living has continued excessively high during the period under review. The daily wage of an unskilled labourer reached and remains at Rs,5/- plus food and other wages are in proportion. The rationed distribution of foodstuffs and cloth by the Supplv Denart- ment proved helpful.

The R.A.F continued to maintain their signal detachment, aerial navigation beacon, and Rest-house throughout the year, and further in creased their detachment by stationing two seaplane tenders and E5 men at Shuwaikh. X. KmVAIT OIL COMPANY At the commencement of the year the company was still working on a shut-down basis, but during the first quarter of 1945 work was begun on a hydrographic survey and the testing of proposed sites for loading tankers. Late in March the Company was authorised to begin work on the 30,000 barrels per day crude oil export scheme. Two brackish water wells at a point about 20 miles W.N.W. of Burgan were sunk, and on their completion work was started on the well reconditioning pro gramme. A party from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company^ Pipe-line Construction Department began to arrive in October and their work has progressed satisfactorily up to the end of the year. A contract for the construction of tankage was placed with the Motherwell Bridge &amp; Engineering Company who commenced their work in the beginning of November and have made fair progress. At the year f s end the Company 1 s personnel strength amounted to:- Senior Staff 79. Junior Staff 68. , Foreign Artisans 55. Labour 894. In addition approximately 307 contract labourers were employed. The company hope to be able to export crude oil by May, 1946. Sir William Eraser, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company accompanied by Messrs E.H.0. Elkington and J.M. Wilson, directors, visited Kuwait on the 27th November. 21 • EASTERN G-ULF OIL COMPANY . The company's personnel and equipment were taken over by the Kuwait Oil Company on the 1st April, 1945. XEI. IMPERIAL BANE OF IRAN . The bank had another satisfactory year and maintained the con fidence of the public, as is shown by the increase in their private deposits during the year of about three and half million rupees. Only w one bad debt {of Rs.25,000) was sustained and it is unlikely that more than a fraction will be recovered. An unusual feature was the absence of demand for rupee coinage. Instead of these being withdrawn the bank T s holding of coin increased by about Rs.3,50,000. 2111. VISITORS . A considerable number of service personnel visited Kuwait during the year. Accomodation was provided either at the Agency or at the H.A.F. rest-house. XIV.

(Continued)-3- 3. THE AL KHALIFAH FAMILY . (i) His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., the Ruler of Bahrain, continued to take a great interest in all state affairs and, in par ticular, in the food rationing system which was subsi dised by his government to the extent of Rs.11,800,000. In late November His Highness accompanied by his uncle, Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa al Khalifah, C.I.E., akjsls and other members of the Al Khalifah family went on a shoouing trip to Saudi Arabia. The party proceeded as far as Hafar where most of the shooting was done and, on their return a month later, were seen off at Al Khobar by His Highness the Amir Saud. it is said that the trip cost more than Rs.300,000. (ii) Shaikh Salman bin Mohammad, fifth son of the senior uncle of His Highness was sent to Jerusalem in April for a course of judicial training. (iii) Khalid bin Mohammad bin Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa returned from Egypt in November. His education has led him into the paths of youth organizations, in this instance not conducive to the best interests of Bahrain. Strength on 1.1.1945 31.12.1945 British Indians Arabs Followers Clerks Naturs . Manama Muharraq Other Posts The increase in the strength of the State Police is due to the disbanding of the Special Defence Police on the Oil Fields who were then absorbed into the State Police. The decrease in the strength of Naturs is due to the lack of suitable men for enlistment. There were no serious crimes during the year. The incidence of thefts was smaller than that of the pre vious year. The three most prominent cases were those in which 35,000 rounds of ammunition were stolen from the Royal Air Force, 18,000 rounds of ammunition from the State Police and 20 tyres by an American citizen from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. There were 34 road accidents resulting in 12 deaths and 3 serious injuries. 5. AGRICULTURE . The Egyptian Agriculturist left the Bahrain Government during the year. 4. POLICE .

The work of the Municipalities was confined to routine matters and no important projects were / instituued. 7- PUBLI C WORKS. No new major works were carried out during this year. 8. ELSCTRIGITY DEPARTMENT . (a) The new generating set of 206 KW capacity arrived in Bahrain in March, 1945, but the extension of the power House having proceeded little beyond the stage of planning and the engine having arrived minus certain essential parts, the plant was not in operation by the end of the year and the three overworked and long enduring British sets catered very spasmodically for the needs of the hard tried and perspiring population of Bahrain during a very unpleasant hot weather. Were it not that the R.A.F.'s plant at Muharraq came into operation on the 1st June and thereby released the Government power House of about 100 KW of their load the situation would have been even worse than it was. Consumers were, during the hot weather, cut off daily at regular (sic) intervals and the total period during which supply was proportioned was as follows A &amp; C Feeders 264 hrs. 11 Minutes. Royal Naval Base, Jufair 233 ' 8 ' Belgrave Feeder 196 11 49 ' Bazaar Feeder 73 ' 30 ' Muharraq, which has its own feeder, was cut off for a total of 18 hrs. 37 minutes. The total period of shutdowns for mechanical defects was 786 hrs. 15 minutes during the months Apr il/D ec ember. (b) Extensions to Power Supply . (1) In April the Royal Air Force Rest House and the British Overseas Airways Corpora tion Jetty were connected by means of a new L.T. Line and transformer from the Shaikh's Palace at Gudhaibiya. % (2) The British Overseas Airways Corporation Transit Camp, Gudhaibiya, was connected by means of a new H.T. Line and 20 KVA Transformer during July. (3) A new sub-station for the British Overseas Airways Corporation Rest House was connected direct from the Government power House by (continued)(3 -5- raeans of an H.F. underground cable to provide an increased supply for Air Conditioning during 1946. 'he length of this cable line is approximately 1,360 feet and power will not be available to this new line until tne new generating set, now being erected, comes into service. 9. TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT . The Bahrain Government telephone system is antiquated in the extreme and badly needs replacement. The scheme for installation of an automatic telephone exchange has, regrettably, shown little progress due to various factors. One is the tendency of the landlords of the few convenient sites to hold out for high ground rents and Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited 1 s unwillingness to meet their demands which renders it most unlikely that an automatic telephone exchange will be in operation in 1946. The fact remains that by the end of the year Gable &amp; Wireless had not placed the order for the new exchange much to the detriment of British prestige. 10. PEARL INDUSTRY . The pearling season was a successful one. There v/ere about 121 pearling craft out this year. The catch was better and prices higher than those of the previous season. H. CUSTOMS . Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Rs.25,98,098 for the year. There were 113 launches registered with the Customs on the 31st December, 1945, including those belonging to the Navy and the various companies. 12 • -FOOD CONTROL . During the year under review the Government again devoted a considerable amount of time, money and energy in ensuring that adequate supplies of ess-ential foodstuffs were available for the public. In all a sum of Rs.11,800,000 as compared to the 1944 figure of Rs.8,000,000 was spent on the purchase of wheat, millet, rice, tea, sugar, and dates. i The monthly ration per adult was maintained at a high level throughout the year. Towards the close of the year the Government introduced a cloth rationing system, which should prove successful. The number of retail shops was increased and rations divided equally amongst them. During the year there was a steady stream of commodities such as potatoes, onions, fresh and dried fruius, walnuts, etc., trom Persia, where the good rains of the previous winter assisted in maintaining'a sufficient supply.

The following is a statement of ships that called at Bahrain during the year 1945;- British American Dutch Panamanian French Norwegian I kalian Swedish Greek 171 154 27 15 9 9 4 3 2 Total 394 o r • i The total imports for the year amounted to 92,901 tons, while exports amounted to 17,326 tons. On behalf of the United Kingdom's Commercial Corporation, for whom Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company, Limited, are the agents, the following foodstiiffs were imported:- Wheat 10502401 Kilos Barley 1185378 ' Millet 982438 14. ACCIDElyTS WITHIN PORT LIMITS . (i) On the 24th January, 1945, a local craft laden with a cargo of dry dates, sprang a leak in the harbour and went aground. The cargo was damaged by sea water and had to be removed ashore for drying. The craft was later repaired. (ii) On the 23rd December, 1945, a boat lying at anchor laden wich 300 maunds of Persian wheat was ¥7recked in a strong !i shamal ?r . Che cargo, badly soaked with sea water, was brought ashore for drying and cleaning and the boat was eventually salvaged and towed in for repairs. 15. MEDIGAL (G ene ral ). The medical work of Bahrain was carried out by three hospitals - Victoria Memorial, Mission, and Bahrain Government. Their reports show that the health of the community remains at much the usual level. There was no epidemic in Bahrain throughout the year due to control by mass vaccination and effective quarantine arrangements. The persistence of the Kaus wind and lack of the 'shamal' (NW) probably accounted for the higher than normal incidence of malaria. Small pox reached a very low level only 15 cases being treated in the Victoria Memorial Hospital as compared with 56 in 1944. (Continued)-7- _ Venereal disease showed an increase during the year under review; this is due mainly to the reluctdnce of patiencs to undergo a complete course of treatment. (i) VICTORIA MEMORIAL HQSPTTAT. . Lieutenant M.L.A.

Steele was in charge as Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year except for a period of leave from the 20th July to the 25th October when Dr. Bhandarkar of the Stace Medical Hospital officiated in his place. The quarantine service in Bahrain has isaiis progressed during the last few years, credit, for which goes^to Dr. Steele, whose efforts in'this cause under difficult local conditions have had effect. Some idea of the progress and efficacy of this service may be gauged from the following figures of Bahrain 's worst epidemic, small pox:- Year . No. of cases . 1941 (from Sept.) 193 1942 ' 119 1943 43 1944 57 1945 14 The quarantine station is situated near Muharraq. rhe site is admirable in that it is cut off from the town at high tide. There are two buildings with accommodation for about 150 persons. This station is designed for local use only, it was expanded and improved in 1941 and the following years. Compulsory segregation of infected cases and mass vaccination were also introduced at the same time. No facilities for segregation of passengers from ships and 'planes, if necessary, exist at present, but it is hoped that some arrangements to this end will be made soon. A total of 62 passenger steamers and about 20 tankers and freighters were visited by the Quarantine Medical Officer during the year under review. At present no effective quarantine arrangements have been made for yellow fever, as the expense involved would be too high and not justified by the circumstances, as only passengers of the British Overseas Airways Cor poration f, C M class 'planes, which touch at yellow fever infected areas en route are affected. * 3.6.

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE . Agency Courts . Civil and criminal suits decided during the year totaled 1129 and 405 respectively. „ ,j,ne outstanding case was that of Charles ij. iviinnick, an American, who was found guilty of stealing twenty motor tyres, sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and committed to the Yeravada jail at Poona. ^ 0 18. SDUCATION . Number of schools in existence on 1,1. «45 15 Number of schools opened during 1945 (Continued)Number of schools closed during 1945 Number of students on 1.1.1945 2619 Number of students on 31,12.45 2736 Number of teachers on 1.1.1945 127 Number of teachers on 31.12.45 137 (1) BOYS' SCHOOLS . All the schools are filled to capacity and. in some cases the classes are overcrowded. Numbers of applications for admission had to be refused. According to the policy adopted the previous year to send some boys to Egypt for advanced studies, 16 students let t for Cairo during the year. War time exigencies have resulted in a serious dearth of school stationery; a s^iall quantity was, however, obtained through the British Council. The failure of the British Council to provide a Director is a great set-back to the Islands' educational efforts. iiu GIRLS 1 SCHOOLS . 16 students passed their final examinations and most of them have been appointed as teachers. There has been a considerable improvement in the gene ral health of the girls owing bo regular visits to the schools by the Health authorities. The annual Exhibi tion of needlework was a great success. (iii) TECHNICAL SCHOOL. Two new subjects were introduced during the year in the Technical School, viz., Elementary Electri city and Weaving. Three students were sent for further technical training to Cairo. 19- THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY . (a) General Management . Mr. Ward P. Anderson was the General Manager and Chief Local Representative of the Company through out the year. Mr. Don J. Hanna, one of the Vice-Presi dents of the company was present in Bahrain from time to time throughout the year. (b) Production and Development . Total oil produced during 1945 was 7,308,938 net barrels, an average of 20,024 net barrels per day. The rate of production has been held practically con stant throughout the year with distribution of production from the reservoir being slightly altered due to expan sion of the artificial gas cap. During the year faci lities 'for the production of aviation gasoline and increased quantities of other products vital to the successful prosecution of the war were completed and put into operation. The construction of facilities to permit the direct loading and unloading of ocean (Continued)-11- ocean going ships at Sitra was commenced during the year and was progressing satisfactorily at the year's end. (c) producing Field . Although no actual development work was commenced during the year, plans were laid, equip ment and materials were ordered and some preliminary work was done pursuant to a development programme to be inaugurated in 1946. Considerable detailed work of a geological nature was done in the re-examination of well formation samples to obtain all data possible. Several water wells throughout the island were electric logged. Four more wells were rehabilitated during the year leaving four wells in this programme which are still secured requiring extensive re-work before they can be returned to production. (d) impor u of Arabian American Crude Oil . The total import of Arabian crude during 1945 was 15,649,272 net barrels. Upon completion of the 12' Arabia-Bahrain sub-marine pipe line from Arabia to the Refinery, the Zellaq terminal was dis mantled and is now obsolete. .The last cargo received through Zellaq was on 3rd March, 1945, and from 1st January to 3rd March a total of 1,831,053 net barrels were handled through its facilities before being abandoned in favour of the Arabia-Bahrain pipe line. The balance of Arabian crude was received through this line except for 564,225 net barrels delivered by tanker and unloaded at Sitra. (e) Refining Operations . Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate'of throughput and were augmented by the, commissioning of aviation gasoline production facilities. During the year crude runs totaled 22,875,136 barrels of which 32% was Bahrain crude while the balance was imported from Arabia. Shipment of products manufactured from the foregoing crude runs were divided as follows;- i Aviation gasoline Motor gasoline Kerosene Diesel oils Fuel oils 322,997 Barrels 5,236,866 ' 2,061,684 ' 4,356,643 ' 5,637,130 ' Total 17,615,320 Barrels With the ending of the war, the demand for aviation gasoline dropped rapidly with the result that all aviation shipping tankage was full about the end of October. All aviation facilities were shut, down at that time and still remained idle at the end of the year The balance of the refinery continued operating at full throughput.-12- (f) New Refinery Storehouse . With the enlarged refining facilities installed during the last two years increased storehouse equipment was necessary. To fill this requirement, a new 98' x 204 1 storehouse was started in the latter part of 1945 and should be completed early in 1946. (g) Additional Generator - No.2 Power Plant . An additional 3,000 KW. generator purchased in connection with the increased operating facilities is in the process of installation and should be avail able for use early in 1946. With the completion of this unit the total rated nominal electric power capa city will be 14,000 KW. (h) Causeway . The new 30' width causeway which was indicated in last year's report ars being built to a point about 13,000 feet offshore was placed into operation before full completion in order to utilize it in connection with the new wharf construction. Also during the latter part of the year it was used to great advantage in con nection with a 6,500 ton cargo of bulk coke and three full cargoes of drummed products from the drum plant. As intimated above, the causeway construction is not yet complete, a certain amount of dirt and rock fill still being required to bring the roadway up to speci fied elevation before final grading can be completed, (i) New Wharf . During 1945 construction of a -new 4 berth wharf was started, located about 1800 feet beyond the pierhead terminus of the new causeway and connected to it by an elevated trestle capable of full scale truck traffic. Jt is expected that the south end will be ready for receipt of incoming cargo in January 1946 and that all construction will be complete for.full opera tion about March, 1946. With the completion of these facilities and the new loading pumps at Sitra, it should be possible to finish any bulk oil shipment in 24 to 36 hours. (j) Camp Facilities . The growing Company facilities and increased personnel have necessitated extensions to the Awali village. A new housing area has been laid out and six new two-bedroom and eleven new three-bedroom air cooled houses have been built and twenty two-bedroom houses are in the course of construction. A new sewage pump- house was also constructed in this area. The Awali storehouse office was found to be inadequate and was extended during the year. (k) Personnel . The following gives a summary of the personnel employed by the Company on their regular operations and on additional construction work during the year:- (Continued)-13- Araericans 261 British (U.K.) 292 Canadians 82 South Africans 28 Other Europeans 8 British Indians 681 •Iraqis 20 Bahrainis 3580 Others 736 (including 105 Contractors Employees). 5688 (1) Royalties on Bapco Oil . During the half year period from the 1st January, 1945, to the 30th June, 194o, the Royalties paid to the Shaikh and the Bahrain Governmeni: amounted to Rs. 15,65,925 (Rupees fifteen lacs, six^y-five 'Uhou- sand nine hundred and twenty-five only). The statement for Royalties for the second half.of the year under review had not been received at the time of compilation of this report. ^ /s , si , ~ 9 '(c? so. visits of foiiaiai'i notables . (i) Mr. Van der Meulen, Minister for the Netherlands, at Jedda, passed through Bahrain en route to Bushire on the 7th January, and spent a couple of days here. (ii) His Excellency Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, spent almost two weeks in Bahrain during June. He stayed with His Highness. 21. LOCAL AFFAIRS. (i) On the 1st January in accordance with the usual custom His Highness accompanied by his senior relatives paid an official call on the Political Agenc. Later the same day some 200 of the leading members of all communities in Bahrain were received by the Political Agenc. (ii) On the 16th February the Spring Race Meeting was held in aid of War Charities and resulted in a satisfactory collection of Rs.16,000/- to that end. (iii) As hour by hour publicity made v .E, DAY more obviously imminent, there were local attempts to 'jump the flag'; the anxiety to celebrate, coupled with the normal nervous tension of the Arab, could not wait for the official all-clear, when it did come there was inevitably a tinge of anti-climax in the picture. Nevertheless, flags during the day and lights at night made a brave show. The squibs were old and damp but their dulness served only as a reminder that material for making them was for use in sterner fireworks. (Continued)mm w mi r wmf'' - zsk -14- 0 urkish th Floodlights on the Agency did wonders of make-up for its diurnal face. The 9th, 10th and 14th May were public holidays. On the 14th May the poli- tjical Agent gave an Arab dinner for His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, the heads of local British and American institutions and leading merchants. (iv) Celebrations for V,J, DAY on the 15th August came as somewhat of an anti-climax to that of V.E.DAY. Celebrations were reserved and the inevitable lassitude engendered by the month of Ramadhan undoubtedly played its part, (v) On the 21st December Haji Yousuf Ahmad Kanoo died at the age of 71. piis association with His Majesty's Government: started in 1898 in the time of the Agent Haji Ahmad bin Abdur Rasool. He continued to serve as Assistant until the arrival of Mr.Qasken in 1902, and was associated with Major Prideaux and Cap tain Mackenzie until 1909. He received-the Kaiser-i-Hind medal, second class in 1911, the title of^Khan Sahib in 1917 and the M.B.E. in i919. In 1924 a C.I.E. was bestowed upon him. The death of this well known old Arab v/as marked in Bahrain by the closing of the Bazaars for one day. 22. THE WEATHER . Local repute has it that for ten years Bahrain has not had weather of the severity experienced during the month of July of the year under review. For days and nights without intermission the steamy heat was' intense, and there v /as no wind to relieve the atmo- sphere^or ruffle the oily expanse of the sea. It was during this period that the electrical system in Bahrain struck for shorter hours of work and ceased to function for irregular and frequent periods. Some forty to fifty R^A.F. personnel had to be flown out of Bahrain as a result of heat exhaustion and severe 'prickly heat', a skin disease which in its mildest form produces nervous irritation and when severe ^an be acutely poisonous, and of which there were verv many cases. No European or Indian during this period' was free from it and many Arabs also were affected. 23. ECONOMIC . (i) Banking and Currency . With the cessation of hostilities both in the west and in the east during the year, there was a con siderable loosening in the regulations controlling trade and currency which gave both the merchants and banking authorities a chance once again to do business. Added to this was the opening of a second banking house - the imperial Bank of Iran - towards the close of 1944 The rates offered by the banks to businessmen had now to be on a competitive basis. Demands for exchange were (Continued) r pfmr ' i-15- more than doubled and Increased towards the close of the year. Exchange on India in particular was in great demand during the last three months of the year. (ii) Eastern Bank . The transactions of the Eastern Bank were concerned chiefly in financing the requirements of the oil .companies operating in this area, and the Navy, Army and Air Force Services. Their imports in currency notes amounted to Hs.119 lacs and sales on India amounted to Rs.70,94,392. During the year they received 583 bills for collection chiefly from England, India, South Africa and the United States of America with a total value amounting to £.98,691. The chief goods imported through the bank from England were cigarettes, piecegoods, hosiery, bicycles, woollen material, hats, photographic material, stationery, medicines and machinery; and from South Africa, tinned provisions, and canned fruits. (iii) Imperial Bank of Iran . The year 1945 was the first year of the Imperial Bank's working in Bahrain, and its activities showed a steady increase throughout the year. The total held in current accounts increased to Rs.31,00,000 on the 31st December, 1945, .from Rs.5,00,000 on 31.12.1944. The Bank's total operations in foreign exchange were:- Purchases Rs.103 lacs. Sales Rs.56 lacs. i Their imports in currency notes and coin amounted to Rs .56,15,000 during the year. Credits were opened to cover imports into Bahrain .to the extent of Rs.375,000. The total value of bills received for collection amounted to Rs.850,000. During December of the year under review the bank made an agreement to purchase a site for a new office. This site is situated on prior Road between the offices of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company, Limited and the Arabian American Oil Company. 24.. GABLE &amp; WIRELESS LIMITED . The staff of this branch number 43, of whom five are European and the rest Indian. Their services were adequately maintained throughout the year, continuous watch for shipping and aircraft being kept, in addition to their telegraphic activities, both Commercial and Service. During the year an agreement was reached between the Bahrain Government and C&amp;ble &amp; Wireless Limited for the installation and operation by the (Continued)■16- latter of an automatic telephone system in Bahrain. Plans to this end showed no progress by the close of the year. 25. BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION . The anticipated stepping up of frequency of services to serve the Far Eastern theatre of war' developed for the first half of the year. Due to the sudden collapse of hostilities with Japan it was evident cowards the latter half of 1945 that the frequency of services would tend to decline, especially in regard to the R.A.F. Flying Boat Refors Programme which was planned by and for otiose handling the Corporation was responsible. The Corporation's scheduled Sunderland services which transit Bahrain were extended from Calcutta to Rangoon in October. In the first half of the year the greater portion of the passengers was Service personnel - transient, embarking and disembarking. Towards the latter part of the year this proportion diminished and the majority of passengers carried was civilian, both Eastbound and' Westbound. It is expected that a Trunk Route Service will shortly be introduced from the United Kingdom to the Far East calling en route at Bahrain thrice weekly. A Lockheed Lodestar Service may be instituted once weekly between Cairo and Bahrain touching at Basra, Baghdad and Damascus. The following is a table of statistics.for the year:- Services Sunderland 'C' Class 'E' Class 'M' Class Dakota Lancastrian Lockheed To tal R.A.F.

PETROLCU:: U0?:ci^T0M3 l.TIiTTKD, time conditions and their aftermath during 1945 again prevented the Petroleum Concessions Limited from obtaining personnel and equipment with which to carry out geological exploration or drilling in the concession areas in the Persian Gulf. Towards the end Ox the year, however, it became possible to make some preparations towards geological exploration in the Trucial Coast and hinterland, and for resumption of drilling in Qatar'early in 1946. With the end of the war with Germany and Japan, the Ruler of Qatar showed a revival of interest in the re-opening of the Qatar Field. He again drew attention to the oil developments in the territories of his neighbours, Bahrain and Arabia, and he is not easily persuaded tnat every effort is being made to recommence drilling and expedite production. On the 20th March, 1945, an oil concession agreement: was concluded with the Ruler of Umm-al -Qaiwain on uerms which compare with the other concessions on the Trucial Coast. Towards Che end of the year the Company were in. correspondence wiuh this Agency on the subject of the use of Company Aircraft in the Persian Gulf and Muscat territory. Approval has also been obtained zo the construction of a Company Landing ground in Qatar. 27. TH5 ROYAL AIR FORGE . Early in the year under review Air Commodore Oliver accompanied by rather more than 20 expeits made a survey of the new R.A.F. commitments on Muharraq Island and informed the political Agent that the per- sonnel of the R.A.F. would be increased by a further 600 men during the summer. The progress with the laying of pierceo. s^-eel sheeting alongside the runways has been satisfactory. Later a firm of Palestinian contractors commenced work on the laying of pierced steel sheeting on a bitumen and sand foundation on the main runways themselves, and making other improve ment* s.

Hart left for the United States on leave and was succeeded in turn by Mr. William L. Sands and Mr. Walter W. Birge, Jr. I in December Mr. Parker T. Hart returned to Dhahran. Mr. Clarence Mcintosh was Vice-consul until the end of the year. The State Department has attached growing importance to their consular post at Dhahran. In January Oman (Muscat), Qatar, and the Trucial Coast were informally included within the district of Dhahran Consulate and in December Mr. Parker T. Hart returned to Dhahran as the United States Consul, - A close and friendly liaison was main tained between this Agency and the Dhahran Consulate in all matters of common interest, in January Mr. Parker T. Hart accompanied Major T. Hickinbotham, C.l.^., O.3.E., the Political Agent, Bahrain, on a tour of the Trucial Coast. In June and July Mr. William L. Sands attended as a spectator at the trial of an American employee of the Bahrain Petroleum Company who was sentenced to one year's simple imprisonment by the Agency Courts. d ni v:-19- 29. QATAR . Q A T A R . 29 (i) The Ruler of Qatar, His Excellency Sheikh Abdulla bin Qasira al-Thani, is now about 74 years old, and continues in good health despite a few set-backs such as an attack of impetigo of the feet. He was treated for this by the Agency Medical Officer who went to Qatar in late November to attend to him. His age prevents him from carrying out efficiently all affairs of State most of which are now done by his second son and heir-presumptive, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdulla, who is now 40 years old. The latter, of whom the father is very fond, is the keeper of the official seal and issues all letters in his father's name. (ii) Local Affairs . SheiKh Hamad goes down to Doha, the Capital of Qatar, daily to attend to affairs of State and also tries important cases, petty and minor cases are dealt with according to Islamic Law by the Amir of Doha, one Hammam by name, an old and trusty follower of the Shaikh, (iii) Revenue . The chief source of revenue for the Shaikh accrues from the subsidy on oil given by Petroleum Concessions (Qatar) Limited, Other sources of revenue are Custotlas duty at 7% on imports and exports of barley and wheat and 5% duty and 2% demurrage tax on all other goods, (iv) Education . Education is confined to boys, there being about eight small schools with a total number of 300, They are taught the Koran, simple arithmetic and the Arabic script. Ho schools for girls have as yet been opened. (v) pearling industry . The pearling fleet consists of about 70 craft with a total crew of about 1,500 persons, most of whom come from the hinterland and Persia during the pearling season. During the year under review the catch was small but due to the high price prevail ing for pearls the margin of profit was most encouraging. ( vi ) Shipping . No steamers call at Doha, the port of Qatar. The 'Khuziztan' of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited periodically calls there to replenish Qatar's supply of kerosene oil and petrol. Traffic between Qatar and ports outside is carried by dhows. (Continued). -20- (vii) Official Visits . The Political Agents visited Qatar twice during the year. The first visic was by Mr, C.J.PELLY, O.B.E., I.G.S.. during April in i;he P.C.L. launch ' ^ GI-IAZAL ,, and the second in November by Lieutenant- Colonel A.C. GALLOWAY, O .3 .E., accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, in H.M.3. 'SEABELLE'. (viii) Health . There are no doctors or medical facilities in Qatar. Sanitation is most primitive and as a result the health of the community is not of a high order. Malaria is most insidious. Fairly prevalent too are dysentery, syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis. Small- poxappears from time to time. Dr. Steele, the Agency Medical Officer, paid a visit to Qatar at the request of the Sheikh late in November. As news spread of the arrival of the Medical Officer people streamed in from the country-side to be treated. After 4 days the doctor returned, his supply of drugs having given out. Many people had to return home disappointed.■i -21- ii:- 30. TRIJCIAL COAST . (a) (i) Trucial Shaikhs. THUCIAL COAST. 30.

The British Overseas Airways Corporation East and West bound services were regular during the year except for a period from the 20th November onwards, when the ensign Services ceased. The local people could not Gravel by the B.O.A.G. flying boats which touched at Sharjah due to their inability to obtain inoculation against yellow fever. However, arrange ments were made with the Royal Air Force Transport Command to carry local passengers during this period. (ii) Mr. Monteiro was in charge of the branch at Dubai of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company, Limited, until he left for India/on the 13th October. He was relieved by Mr. E. Fernandez. During the year under report 34 ships called at Shariah and 50 at Dubai.

(c) ANTI-LOCUST MISSION . in the middle of June the Anti-Locust Mission closed down having concluded a campaign. Capcain U. Joyce, R.O.A.C., the head of the Mission left for Cairo by air on the 18th June and the Indian personnel for India on the 16th June. ( d ) tours . (i) on the 6th March the Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey prior, k .C.I .s., the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived at Sharjah by air from Bahrain and left again for Bahrain on the 8th of March. -* • i • (J 1 ) Ma J or T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E., 0.B.E,, Political Agent, Bahrain, toured the Trucial Coast from the 15th to the 21st January, from the 20th to the 22nd February, and from the 6th to the 8th March. (i-ii.) Lir. C.J. Pelly, O.B.E., I .C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain, toured the Trucial Coast from the 20th to the 23rd May, from the 15th to the 17th July, and from the 10th to the 14th October., (iv) Captain R.e.R . Bird, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, visited the Trucial Coast on the 21st : --v-23- October and returned to Bahrain on the 24th October. (v) Lieut-Col. A,C. Galloway, the Political Agenc, Bahrain, toured the Trucial Coast . from the 12th.to the 19th December, (vi)On the 26th February the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, visited Sharjah in H.M.S. 'Seabelle'. (vii) Major A,L. Greenway, M.B.E., Residency Surgeon, Bushire, visited the Trucial Coast on the 6th December and left by air for Bahrain on the 9th December. (e) MEDICAL , There were no epidemics of any kind reported during the year. The majority of people suffered from chronic malaria with splenomegaly. Other prevalent complaints were venereal disease, and diseases of the eyes and respiratory and digestive systems. (f) ROYAL AIR FORGE. A large number of thefts from the R,A,F. Camp were reported during the year. These included thefts of cash, ammunition, cable, M.T. Parts, and machine tools and parts. Theft was rendered com paratively easy on account of the very inadequate security arangements in the camp. In October, however, the camp was partially fenced with barbed wire and Levy guards were, with the approval of the Shaikhs of sharjah and Dubai, ordered to open fire on any person found in or around the camp at night and who failed to halt when challenged in the proper manner. These measures resulted in some decrease in the number of thefts. (g) U.S.A.A.T.C . (i) in August the American Air Transport Command Detachment were withdrawn from Sharjah. They took with them most of their vehicles and equipment. A small staff of one officer and eight men were left behind who expect to leave there shortly. (ii) An American Survey Party, consisting of Lieutenant Moore and four men, arrived at Sharjah for the purposes of establishing ground 'fixes' in con nection with the survey for an air route. They operated in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras al Khaimah, and Diba, and eventually left the Trucial Coast on the 22nd October for Muscat territory to continue the survey. They returned to Sharjah on the 20th November where they closed down and left for Cairo. Lieutenant Moore later returned and disposed of the party's six vehicles by sale to the Trucial Shaikhs. v. (Continued)-24- (h) LOCAL AFFAIRS . (i) In February a merchant named Roopchand Permanand of Tatta (Sind) was murdered in Abu Dhabi. He was the only British Indian subject in that place and had settled there many years ago. The murderer was caught, found guilty, and was executed by shooting. (ii) On the 6th March the Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K .G .I .E., political Resideni: in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by Major T. Hickinbotham, G.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Sharjah by air. The next day the Hon'ble the Political Resident visited the village of Dhaid, some 40 miles from Sharjah, where he received the Shaikhs of Has al Khaimah, Ajman, Sharjah, Dubai, IJmrn al Qaiwain, the Regent of Kalba, and the Paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab tribe. The gathering wqs of considerable size and the Shaikhs were accompanied by many of their relatives and followers. The Hon'ble the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrain, discussed various matters of interest with the Shaikhs and later invited them and their followers to lunch. After the lunch the Hon'ble the Political Resident addressed the gathering and then returned to Sharjah. It is Interesting to note .that all the Rulers of Trucial Oman were present at this gathering with the exception of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who was absent owing to the distance of his State from the rendezvous. The greatest amiability prevailed during the gathering and the Shaikhs appeared to be on very cordial terms with each other though, with one exception, they all appeared, as is customary, armed to the teeth. The exception was the most warlike of them all. Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, the Paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab, who, out of courtesy to the Resident, arrived with his followers unarmed. (iii) On the night of the 17th October, Shaikh Rashid, son of the Shaikh of Dubai, occupied Khor Ghanadhah with about 300 armed men. They took with them large quantities of building materials and showed every intention of building a fort there. In 1937 a settlement of the boundary between Dubai and Abu Dhabi was attempted and Ghanadhah was then not included in Dubai's claim. This move then amounted to an aggression against Abu Dhabi, and moreover as many of the armed men were transported by sea it also constituted a breach of the treaty of 1853 with His Majesty's Government which forbade aggression by sea. The Assistant political Agent, Bahrain, left on the 21st October for the Trucial Coast to investigate and reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was preparing to meet force with force, and that hostilities between Dubai and Abu Dhabi appeared to be imminent. The Political Agent, Bahrain, acting on the instructions of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf demanded the withdrawal of all Dubai's forces from the,Khor. This (Continued) n-25- This demand was complied with on the 29th October. Ay the same time a promise was extracted from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi that he would not take any* retaliatory action, (iv) Khalifah bin Zayid died peacefully at Buraimi at' the reputed age of 108 years. He was the uncle of Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayid, the present Ruler of Abu Dhabi, He played a pro minent part in the affairs of Abu Dhabi and was Shaikh Shakhbut's chief adviser and confidant.

AGENCY OFFICIALS . tu3 Political Agent: Assistant Poli tical Agent: Treasxjry Officer: Medical Officer: II. MEDICAL . (a) General. The Municipality were unable to find a successor to Saiyid Abbas bin Faisal, whose services as Director of Public Health were terminated last year. In so far as his time al lowed 7 the Agency Surgeon assisted in the supervision of anti malarial measures and sanitation, but lack of equipment, the reluctance of the public to permit inspections of house pro perty, and the absence of any responsible official in the Mu nicipality to carry out any suggestions made, rendered progress difficult. Towards the end of the year, some improvement in public health measures was manifest due, principally, to the personal interest taken by the new President of the Municipality, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur. (b) Agency Hospital, * The hospital was open throughout the year. Although some difficulty was experienced in obtaining an adequate sup ply of drugs, particularly quinine, attendance figures showed a substantial increase. With the end of the war, it became possible to consider the general improvement of facilities available at the hospital and generous support for the achieve ment of the object was received from all communities. The attendance figures were as under: (1) New cases .. 9376 (2) Total number of cases treated during the year .. 24798 (3) Average daily attendance 6B (4.) Total admitted to hospital 211 (5) Major operations (emergency) 2 (6) Minor operations .. O As•*...• Lt. Col. A.C. Galloway, O.B.E. from 1st January to 21st April. Mr. R.I.

Mr. G.H. Khan from 8th October till the end of the year. Captain A.G.T. Matthews, I.A.M.C. throughout the year.-2- As before, the chief cause of illness was malaria, a total of 2^.09 patients being treated for this ailment alone. Cerebel symptoms were observed in some of these cases. On ly e very small proportion of patients treated for : malaria had been infected outside Muscat. The incidence of malaria appears to be considerably higher in Mutrah than in the town of Muscat. Other prevalent diseases were ulcers, digestive diseases, diseases of the eyes, malnutrition and veneifcil diseases. Unusual cases included two of snake-bite from Rus- sel's vipers, and the treatment of three fishermen bitten by sharks outside Muscat harbour. Quarantine . Muscat was free from epidemics during the year. No quarantine measures were necessary in the case of stea mers visiting Muscat. One case of small-pox was found on a dhow in April, but no subsequent cases occurred. Extensive repairs to buildings at the quarantine station at Haramil, which suffered considerable damage from the hea^vy rains of the previous year, were undertaken by the Muscat Government. A permanent guard for the quarantine station was appointed in May and shortly afterwards the Muscat Govern ment appointed officials to examine all persons entering Mutrah and Muscat either by overland routes or by dhow. III. FOUTJCAL SITUATION . (a) Tribal In the first three months of the year it seemed likely that a dispute between the Muscat Government and the Beni Ka'ab supported by the Beni Qitab and Awamir tribes, might assume serious proportions. The cause of the dis pute was an unfortunate decision to appoint Saiyid Moham med bin Hilal as Wali of Shinas. This wali had previously been involved in a quarrel with the Beni Ka'ab and had, without reference to the Muscat Government, attempted its settlement by ruthlessness. His actions, which culminated in tie execution of one of the tribesmen by firing him from the mouth of a cannon, had necessitated his immediate removal; but they had not been forgotten by the Beni Ka'ab. On be ing re-posted to Shinas, the dispute broke out again and on this occasion the Chief Wali, with the concurrence of the Minister for External Affairs, decided to support Saiyid Mohammed. Keeping well in the background himself, the Chief Wali despatched arms, ammunition and money to Shinas, but when it became evident that the tribesmen were not to be intimidated by such a move, he hastily reversed his at titude and Saiyid Mohammed was once again removed from his post. With the appointment of a new Wali, conditions at Shinas returned to normal. Later in the year, news that the Imam was seriously ill led to developments which are likely to have important consequences in the future. His Highness has always regarded the death of the Imam as the moment for him to attempt to restore-3- restore the authority of his dynasty in Oman. With the knowledge that the Imam could not be expected to live much longer, he has been anxious for some time to establish closer relations with the Shaikhs of the Beni Bu Ali, the Beni Riyam and the Hirth group, the three most powerful tribes in the interior. The first indication that an approach to the tri bal leaders might meet with satisfactory response, came in a friendly letter from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh of the Shar- qiyah (Eirth), the Imam's most influential supporter, in which he stated that he intended to take no part in any questions concerning future of the Imamate. Shortly after wards, the Sultan was much gratified to receive letters from Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali and Shaikh Sulaiman bin Eamiyar of the Beni Riyam asking to see him at Sur as early as possible. On his way to Muscat in May, the Sultan met these two Shaikhs at Sur and arranged for them to come to Muscat as his guests. The ensuing talks at Muscat gave him great satisfaction and convinced him that the Ghafiri confederation,of which Shaikh Ali and Shaikh Sulaiman are the leaders,would support him in his aims. Of the attitude of the rival Hinav/i faction, the Sultan was less certain; but when Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, the leader of the Einawis, visited him at Muscat later in the year there was every indication that more friendly relations than had hitherto existed, had been established between them. Though Eis Eighness was aware that political action would be the main stay of any success he might achieve in the unifica tion of his state under his rule, the need for sufficient force to discourage opposition led him to approach the Po litical Agent for an indication of the support he might expect from Eis Majesty's Government. In making the ap proach, Eis Eighness stated that whatever advice were given him in regard to his aims by the British Government he would accept. Ee took the opportunity of discussing this question with the Eon'ble the Political Resident during the latter's visit to Muscat in December and the matter is now under consideration. The events already described inevitably caused tension between the two great political factions in the interior, the Ghafiri and Einawi, each being intensely suspicious of any move by the other which might upset the balance of power between them. In August, this tension showed signs of developing into open hostilities in the neighbourhood of the Tftadi Beni Khalid - an area under the domination of the Beni Bu Ali of the Ghafiri faction. At the request of Shaikh Ali, and with the agreement of the Sultan, and Shaikh Sulaiman, a new Qadhi was appointed to this Wadi in September from the Beni Riyam. On taking over charge, this Qadhi hoisted the Imam's flag and, at the mi tigation of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, conducted his affairs under the Imam's name. Enraged by what he considered to be a Einawi intrigue to usurp his authority. Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali despatched a party to tear down the flag and to deal suitably the erring Qadhi. The dispute then took a more serious turn, for Shaikh Isa, con sidering that the Imam's authority had been infringed, oc cupied the Wadi by force and Shaikh Ali's men were forced to beat an ignominious retreat. The matter was eventually settled by the Sultan who, with his customary skill, turned-4- the dispute to his own advantage by securing the agreement of all concerned to the appointment of a Qadhi from Muscat, It was further agreed that the new Qadhi should fly His Highness* flag and conduct his affairs in the name of the Sultan. For the first time in the recent history of Muscat, a^representative of the Ruling Family, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, visited Dhahirah area. The visit was made in July and Au gust and Saiyid Tariq was well received throughout his tour. (b) Local. Ismail bin Khalil Ar Rassassi, Chief Wali and Wali of Mutrah together with Anwar al Khatib, Headmaster of the Saidieh School, proceeded on leave to Palestine in July. Their places were taken by Saiyid Sultan bin Hamood and Saiyid Thuwaini bin Shihab, respectively. It became evi dent during the month of Ramadhan that the former was not equal to the task of controlling affairs of Mutrah. Tension between the Khoja and Baluch communities, allowed to grow unchecked, led to stabbing affrays and a threat of serious rioting. The situation returned to normal after ten ar rests had been made by the Muscat Government and the Poli tical Agent. Saiyid Saud bin Ali, Wali of Sur and one of Muscat's most capable officials was unfortunately forced to relinquish his charge in September owing to ill-health. He subsequently died at Mutrah in November. His place at Sur was taken by Saiyid Hamood bin Hamad pending the appointment of a permanent successor. ml The following transfers amongst ?/alis were made by the Sultan during the year: Saiyid Saud bin Badr from - Khassab to Gwadur, Saiyid Hamad bin Hilal from Gwadur to Sur, to relieve Saiyid Hamood bin Hamad. IV. TRADE . (1) The follovdng table gives the comparative values of imports and exports during the last three years: Year 1942-^3 1943-44. 1944-45 Imports Exports. Rs.63,40,792/- Rs. 81,18,976/- Rs.1,43,82,740/' Rs. 1,28,34,679/- Rs.1,73,17,100/- Rs. 1,57,66 400/- Although rising price levels have been responsible for these increases, there has also been a general increase in quantities of goods imported. The following table shows the average price per package: 1942-43 1943-44 1944-45 Imports Rs. 34/3 Rs. 93/7 Rs. 121/13 The following table shows the percentage of imports and exports from and to other countries:*5* Imports Exports 1943-U 1944-45 1943-44 1944-4; Aden and Aden Protectorate 3.20% 2.0tf 4.00$ 0.54$ Africa 16.40^ 41.54$ 2.00$ 0.59$ Australia - u.m&gt; - - India 68.00$ 31.32% 56.00$ 39.11$ Iraq 0.6C$ 14.51$ 12.50$ 2.49$ Persia 3*00% 2.20% 4.00$ 13.24$ Persian Gulf 6.80% 2.19$ 21.00$ 41-95$ Portuguese India United Kingdom 1.00% 1.00$ 0.19$ United States of America Palestine '' 0.11$ 0.39 0.10 Syria - - - 1.59 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 \ The main imports were cereals, coffee, sugar and tea; and exports consisted mainly of dates and fish. (2) The exchange rate of the Maria Theresa dollar, the local currency, remained fairly constant through out the year, opening at Rs.223/- per 100 M .T. dollars and closing at Rs,2A8/- per 100 M.T. dollars. The highest rate was R s .260/- recorded in July and the lowest Rs.213/- in June, (3) Trade conditions were as favourable as could be expected, except for the marketing of the date crop. Prices fetched for Muscat dates in India had, in previous years, been rising, but during 1945 the difficulty of transport, particular lyfor distribution within India, caused a considerable drop in prices and lossesx to a number of merchants. V. THE SOUTH ARABIA An ROUTE . The American Air Transport Command ceased operating from aerodromes in Muscat territory in May. These aerodromes continued, however, to be operated by the Royal Air Force. VI. FRENCH INTERESTS . The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year and it is understood that the French Consulate buildin has now been returned to the Sultan by the French Government. VII. MISSIONARY WORK . The American Mission continued its work under the charge of Rev. Dykestra and Dr. W.W. Thoms. Plans have been prepared and a site cleared for the addition of two infectious diseases wards to the Mission Hospital at Mutrah. Slavery-6- VIII. SLAVERY . 40 slaves applied for manumission certificates during the year under report and 30 were granted. Of the 40 appli cants 11 were captured slaves and the remainder domestic slaves. IX. ENEMY ACTIVITISS . Nil. X. WEATHER . In common with the Shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, Muscat experienced a very unpleasant summer. Total rainfall during the year amounted to IS cents and the absence of rain at the end of the year is generally regarded as a bad omen for the coming summer. PART II. I- RULING FAMILY . (a) His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur ; His High ness the Sultan returned from India to Dhofar on the 12th Feb ruary in an aircraft provided by the United States Government. On the 4th April, he paid an official visit to Masirah island and inspected the various installations and buildings of the Royal Air Force, the United States Transport Command, the A§en Protectorate Levies and the British Overseas Airways Cor poration. In May, His Highness arrived at Muscat, where he stayed for the remainder of the year. His long absence from the capital of his State and the consequent inadequate supervision over the various depart ments of his Government had resulted in the standard of admi nistration falling to a deplorably low level. Immediately on arrival. His Highness set about the much needed re-organisa tion with vigour. He took into his own hands the direction of financial matters and control of the Treasury, preparing himself the long overdue budget. His Director General of Customs, who had previously acted as Finance Officer, was ins tructed to concern himself with Customs matters only. The control and distribution of essential supplies and the regu lation of price levels, in connection with which a number of malpractices and abuses had been allowed to go up, were placed on a more satisfactory basis under his personal direction. His actions soon produced a very marked improvement in all branches of his administration. In March, His Highness requested the assistance of the Political Agent in securing the services of a British Of ficer to act as his principal Adviser and to undertake a number of executive and administrative responsibilities. War time conditions made it difficult to find a suitable person for this post, and., upto the end of the year no appointment had been made. OnOn the occasions of the celebrations of the Allied victories over Germany and Japan, His Highness of- ferred his most sincere congratulations on the achievements of His Majesty's Forces in bringing about these victories. On various occasions he stated that he was very glad to feel that his territories had been of some use to His Ma jesty's Government in the prosecution of the war. His Highness remained in excellent health throughout the year. (b) Saiyid Shihab bin Faisal ; A few days after the Sultan's arrival at Muscat, Saiyid Shihab was removed from his post as Minister for External Affairs. His High ness made no attempt to conceal the disgust he felt at the way in which his representative had conducted himself during his absence. Saiyid Shihab left for India for medical treatment in September and returned to Muscat in December. (c) Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal ; The ex-Sultan paid his first visit to Muscat, since abdication, on the 21st September and remained at Muscat till the end of the year. His arrival was celebrated with considerable eclat. Flags flew from Government offices, residences of the members of the Ruling Family and Muscat notables; Muscat buildings on the sea front were festooned with bunting, and sailing craft in harbour were gaily decorated. The reti nues of the various Shaikhs who had arrived at Muscat to meet him gave him the customary welcome by firing their rifles wildly in all directions - a proceeding fortunately not attended on this occasion by any casualties. The object of the ex-Sultan's visit was stated to be his desire to see his aged mother. His behaviour while at Muscat was unobjectionable. (d) Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim ; He remained in office as Minister for Internal Affairs throughout the year. (e) Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur ; He returned to Muscat on the 7th July after completing his administrative training in India. The Sultan had some difficulty in making up his mind as to how best to employ this formidable looking relative, but after good deal of discussion on the subject with the Political Agent, eventually agreed to appoint him as President of the Municipality. In spite of the Sultan's fears that Saiyid Tariq's temperament would prove unsuited to Municipal affairs, the appointment has so far been a dis tinct success. (f) Saiyid Fahr bin Taimur ; He continued his education at the Mayo College, Ajmer. II. MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS . Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur's appointment as Presi dent gave new life and prestige to the Municipality. * A vi gorous campaign to clean up the towns of Muscat and Mutrah was undertaken. Property owners were called upon to either repair or demolish derelict buildings, roads were widened and dangerous corners opened up. The construction of a sea-wall to protect the road from Muscat to Mutrah was com menced, and for the first time a determined effort to improve sanitary conditions in the 'Sur' inhabited by the Khoja com munity was made. III. Education0 ...... -III. EDUCATION. For most of the year, the Saidieh Schoil was only able to run under make-shift arrangements. The teachers recruited from Palestine during the previous year resigned in May due to the Muscat Government's refusal to increase their pay. The Headmaster, Anwar al Khatib, proceeded on leave to Palestine in July, and later informed the Sultan of his intention not to return A new Headmaster and three teachers were recruited from Palestine and expected to reach Muscat at the close of the year. Pending their arrival, the school was placed in the charge of Saiyid Thuwaini bin Shihab. The result of these circumstances was that attendance fell from an average of 130 in the previous year to 90. IV. GEI'IERAL COMMUNICATIONS . (1) Muscat continued to be in direct cable commu nications with Aden, Bahrain and Bushire throughout the year. The Karachi cable was broken - apparently in several places by the earthquake reported in the Arabian Sea on the 2Bth, November. (2) The Royal Air Force wireless station was closed in March. (3) At the close of the year, arrangements were completed for an airmail service to Muscat but its introduc tion had to be postponed owing to mechanical defects in the only launch available for the carriage of mails between Muscat and Ras al Hadd. V. TRANSPORT . Ebcbernal: Only 15 mail steamers from India and 13 from the Persian Gulf ports called at Muscat during the year. The A.I.O.C. oil Tanker 'Khuzistan' 1 made 5 trips ( to Muscat» VI. POLICE . Mohammad Jawad Darwesh was in charge of the Police Force for the year. VII. DKFRNCE . Major L.B. Hirst, 10th Gurkha Rifles continued to hold the post of Military Adviser to His Highness the Sultan. A copy of his report to His Highness the Sultan is attached. VIII. ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL INDIAN NAVY . The following of His Majesty's ships visited Muscat during the year. H.M.S. !, Sea Belle' on the 20th February and 24th April H.M.S.'Neyrou' on the 11th May. h .M .i .S.^Lawrence 11 on the 23rd June. H.M.I.S.'Madras 11 on the 23rd June, 25th July, 6th August and 7th October. h .M.I.S.'Karachi'E.M4&lt;S. 'Karachi' on the 25th July, 6th August and 7th October. IX. ANTI-LOCUST OPERATIONS . An Anti-Locust party under Captain Joyce of the Middle- East Anti-Locust Unit arrived at Muscat from Sharjah on the 19th January. The party worked in the Batinah area until March when they returned to Sharjah. A second visit by the same party was made in April. Two expeditions were planned to investigate locust breeding in the interior; one from the north and the other from the south. Only the second of these expeditions was possible. Mr. Thesiger left Salalah for the Ramlat Mugshin in October with an escort of tribesmen and had not returned by the end of the year. g.wjudjlr. I. BRITISH AGENT . Mr. Eafiz Mohd Ismail from 1st January to 9th September, when his services were dispensed with. Mr. Jassim Barduli from 10th September to 2nd December, when he proceeded on leave. Mr. Hidayatullah from 3rd December till the end of the year. It was considered desirable to bring the post of British Agent, Gwadur to the regular Cadre of the Persian Gulf Residency and Mr. Hidayatullah was the first member of the cadre to be appointed permanently under this new arrangement. II. THE WALI . Hamad bin Hilal held the appointment throughout the year. At the close of the year, Saiyid Saud bin Badr was appointed to relieve him. III. TRADE Due to the lack of shipping, Gwadur's principal export trade in dried fish to Ceylon was carried on under difficulties. Figures of imports and exports are included in those for Muscat. IV. POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS . Two breaks in the telegraph lines to Gwadur from India were reported during the year. Mail facilities at Gwadur remained as before, the suggestion that Gwadur might be linked with Jiwani for Airmail purposes having so far proved impracticable. Communications- '' . r' : mi -10- V. CQUmilCATIONS . Only two ships called at Gwadur during the year VI. ANTI-LOCUST OPERATIONS. Anti-Locust operations were carried out at Gwadur during the first half of the year and it is understood that a considerable measure of success was achieved. VII. AIR FACILITIES. A landing strip on the Gwadur Aerodrome was made serviceable by the Royal Mr Force for use as an emergency landing ground. VIII. EARTHQUAKE . On the 28th of November an earthquake shock of con siderable intensity was felt at Gwadur. Some damage was done to buildings and, as the result of the tidal wave which followed it, three persons lost their lives. A small island some ten miles from the shore of the West Bay was thrown up by volcanic activity. Gwadur was fortunate to escape so lightly in view of the much more serious casualities and damage reported from other places on the Mekran coastline. m KV. uyll Political Agent, Muscat v ' \v* * * * * REPORT ON THE MUSCAT INFANTRY * * * * for the year * * * * 19 4 5. * * * * *REPORT ON THE MUSCAT INFANTRY FOR THE YEAR 194$. 1. Muscat Defences . There is nothing to add to last year's report, the de fences are in good condition and nothing other than minor re pairs are required. It is proposed to remove one 3 Pdr. gun from Eait-al-Falaj to the vicinity of the Mutrah Fort, where it will be in a position to cover the town of Mutrah and all entrances from the Batinah direction and also the coast road from Muscat to Mutrah. A revision in the defensive system will become necessary in the event of there being any alteration in the strength and armament of the Force, as the siting of piquets will be changed. This will also be affected by the M .T. situation. The situation regarding the 12 Pdr. 'Dahpu' Naval gun remains static. After the first burst of enthusiasm by the Navy nothing further has happened, and it rather looks as if it is to become a permanent monument in the same way as the Dahpu herself who continues to disfigure the harbour. The two 2.75 guns are in serviceable condition although the supply of spare parts asked for in 1944- has not been received. It is presumed that these are in very short supply as, so far as is known, this gun is not used anywhere else except by the Tochi Scouts who have some, I believe as Post guns at Miranishah and Datta Khel in the Tochi valley in Waziristan. 2. Launch . The launch has been out of order since March as a new Magneto was required. The old Magneto was repaired in Karachi but proved unsatisfactory. A new one was obtained from Bahrein at the beginning of December and the launch is now running well. A number of planks were replaced in the under water part of the hull during the summer, but a considerable number still require replacing dwing to worms. A new keel is also required (see Annual Report for 1943). It is considered that the present under water part of the hull will give at least another year's service, and it is my opinion that further repairs would be a wafete of time and money until seasoned teak and copper nails become available. The iron nails used in repairs a few months ago have already started 'weeping'. 3. Wireless . There has been no change in the situation. Various firms have been approached with a view to having the aets put in order and providing a suitable wireless mechanic to install them, and to obtain operators, but no satisfactory answers have been peceived. The Cable and Wireless Company are of the opi nion that itisdoubtful whether a sufficiently highly qualified man could be obtained for much under Rs.SOO/- p.m. The makers, the Premier Radio Company have been add ressed a number of times with a view to obtaining blueprints of the sets as none were sent with the sets, but no answer has been received. Mr. Howell of the Cable and Wireless Company very kindly looked at the sets and is of the opinion that repairs to the damaged set s.•.sets might be done locally. He has off erred to attempt to put some in working order when he has the time, but to work them efficiently he says that it is essential to have operators who can read and write English reasonably fluently. If the sets were installed between here and Salalah he is of the opinion that, under the International Convention, it would be necessary to apply to Geneva for the necessary wave-lengths to prevent interference ?7ith other stations. Strength . The Force has been 24- under strength on the average. To all intents and purposes no recruits are coming in either from Muscat territory or Mekran, Coolies are still being em ployed at Masirah and this undoubtedly affects recruiting. It has been suggested that each Wali be asked to sup ply a certain number of men. They would be enlisted for five years with the Qolours and five on the Reserve. During the reserve period they would be called up for 6 weeks training per year. If this scheme were adopted a strong reserve of trained men would be built up for the future should the neces sity arises. Desertions this year are considerably less than in the three previous years. This is due, in my opinion, to the easier living conditions, and will drop to practically nil as conditions improve during the post-war period. Subedar Major Allah Dad is due to retire in February, and although he wishes to stay on, I think it is time he went. He is p getting too old for the work and is blocking promotion. He received the O .B .I. Second Class in the New Year Honours. Jemadar (local Subedar) Shaikh Mohd continues to work well; although not particularly outstanding he is a good steady type and quite suitable for the work. Jemadar Ahmed Sher has reverted to Military duty and has been replaced by Subedar Ahmed Khan. This was an error, as the replacement should have been a Jemadar. Ho?7ever in the event of Subedar Major Alia Dad retiring, I propose making Subedar Ahmed Khan Subedar Major. He appears to be excellent and is young which is all important. It is essential that the replace ment sent for Alia Dad should be a Jemadar and not a Subedar. The Consul has been asked to get a V.C.O. with M.T. and/or Machine Gun Training. Jemadar Fakir Mohd is due to go and it has been agreed to give him 6 months salary and I am trying to find other work for him.. I hesitate to discharge an officer with his service and without a pension as it is unlikely that he has saved any money at all. Jemadar Lashkaran is average, but it is doubtful if he would fill the post of Havildar in the Indian Army. Lack of education is the great drawback to all local officers as they are, to all intents and purposes, unable to read Roman Urdu, which is the language in which all the Training Manuals are written. This lack of education also prevents men being sent on courses. If moneyIf money permitted, it is my opinion that it would be a good scheme to have a cadre of Indian Army N.C.Os here for at least a year. On the basis of 2 per company they would be ad ditional to the ordinary strength and would therefore not block promotion. They would act in an advisory capacity If this scheme were decided upon v it is thought that they would noin be obtainable. 5. Training . (a) Training has been carried out as usual and is consi dered to be stex. satisfactory in every way for the work for which the Force is intended. Training Camps have again been impossible owing to short age of Tentage and Transport, mainly the latter. Short schemes are held and., as reported last year, are considered more bene ficial than long camps, as with the type of man enlisted it is not possible to hold their interest for long periods. The results of Cadre Courses have been better than usual as the standard has been set higher than previously and promo tion stopped if men have failed to qualify at the new standard. Individual and collective training has been carried out satisfactorily. (b) Signallers: All men, with one exception, have passed the Indian Army Tests in Flag, Helio and Lamp, and have worked well on schemes. An Instructor, however, is really necessary to keep the standard up. Since the departure of Jemadar Ahmed Sher we have no one from the Indian Army capable of dealing with this branch. The Signal Havildar is good but is inclined to be a little lost when dealing with Electrical equipment. (c) Artillery: The standard, as before, is exceptionally good considering the very low standard of education, All practice shoots have produced excellent results. It is unfor tunate that owing to lack of transport we have been unable to carry out shoots at any great distance from Bait-al-Falaj. During the year no shoots were carried out with the 3 Pdr. guns owing to shortage of ammunition, none havaing been available during the previous two years. This has now been received and shoots will be carried out in the near future. (d) Machine guns: The results this year show a consider able improvement despite the fact that the guns are greatly overdue for overhaul and replacement. It is hoped that with the end of the war this will now be possible. Jemadar Lashkaran is still in charge and is very keen.^ The gun drill and general handling is as good as I have seen in any Indian Army Unit. The standard of Range Taking is below average and consi derably more attention will be paid to this during 194-6. (e) Weapon Training.-u- (e) Weapon Training: The standard is generally good. All efficers and men armed with the pistol fired the Course as laid down. There were two failures. Both these men passed after further practice. We are suffering at present from the lack of a properly- qualified Armourer, our own having deserted in India. Requests are being made for a replacement from India. It is believed that the Baluch Regt. who have helped us in the past may possibly be able to provide a suitable man. Grounds Training has been carried out but practice with 'live 11 bombs was not possible as our indents for 1944- had not been filled. This has now been rectified and Bombs and Detona tors have been received. MUSKETRY RESULTS. Recruit Course. Total 55 Y.G. 2 Good 26 Fair 7 Average 20 Trained Soldiers .

We are complete in every respect and have stocks on hand sufficient for at least 18 months to 2 years. Supplies this year have been easier to obtain but most ox the clothing being sent is 'Part Worn'. It is pesumed that this is due to Battle- dress having replaced the Bush Shirt. 7. Ammunition.

The cost of grain still remains very high. The horsesI % -5- The horses on charge are all fit. In last year's report it was stated that it was proposed to attempt to bread a mule with a view to using them in future for 2.75 guns. This has not yet been possible as, owing to an unfortunate liaison the mare is in foal to a Stallion. The extra fodder grown at Ruwi and Bait-al-Falaj was sufficient for all animals up to the end of October. Since then a certain amount has had to be purchased outside. Unfortunately the heavy rain last year which caused the Falaj to flow for the first time in aany years does not appear to have had any lasting effect as dried up in the middle of the year. The damage to the various channels was very great and we have been working throughout the year clearing the stoppages. (b) M.T.: Please see reports for 19-43 and 194A? Our M.T to all intents and purposes has been non-existent. Two 30 cwt. Chevrolets were sent to Karachi for repair but were 'written off' by the I .E .M /E. work shops as beyond repair. We have managed to keep one lorry going by stripping the f ourth which was also unserviceable. This lorry can do the journey between Muscat and Mutrah, but the radiator has to be filled up eight times in the 4^- miles. The old R.A.F. lorry has been purchased from the Consulate, and although this requires a lot of attention, it is helping us to carry on. The Government of India has agreed 'to supply four lorries. It is now learned that they are 15 cwt. and second hand Fords. They are apparently in Bombay and shipment is being delayed pending the receipt of an Export Permit. It appears that the issue order for these lorries was published in Delhi in January 1945 and received in Bombay in December 1945. We now hold a very large stock of Chevrolet spare parts as a result of the past three years' indents. All these spares arrived too late to be of any use and will have to be returned or disposed of and Ford spares indented for. The same applies to tyres, of which ?/e have a considerable stock. 9. Medical : Captain Matthews, the Agency Surgeon, continues to officiate as our Medical Officer. His report is appended below: ANNUAL HEALTH REPORT ON THE MUSCAT INFANTRY from 1st January 1945 - 31st December 194-5. \ The general health of the Unit has not been very satisfac tory. Although there was no epidemic of an infectious nature, nevertheless the numbers of sick have been high. I feel that the summer of 1945 must be regarded as accounting a great deal for this rise in sick numbers. During l-lay, June and July the average maximum temperature was 100° C to 102 o C. The wet bulb reading was between 94 0 C to to 98 0 C. With a high maximum temperature and a relatively high humidity reading, a very dangerous period exists. Fortunately no cases-6- no cases of Heat Effects or Heat Exhaustion occurred, but un doubtedly the large numbers of men who suffered from ulcers, relapses of malaria, and those unable to recover from the most trivial of injuries, was due to a very lowered vitality fol lowing a severe summer. The reason Heat Effects etc. were not contracted was due to the lay-out of Barrack Rooms which always had fresh currents of air passing through and at no time had a more humid atmosphere than the outside air.

Malaria, minor septic diseases and injuries are high for reasons as stated before. Other dises.ses were much as the year before. One snake-bite (Vipor) was admitted to Hospital. He recovered but where he was bitted the muscle necrosed and the man was lame. Sanitation and health matters are closely watched by those in authority. When wire gauze is available I would suggest the cook house and hospital being made fly-proof. The men's food is receiving a lot of attention from the O.C. and has definitely improved. Men are also being encouraged to eat more vegetables. The senior I.O.. with the other officers take an interest in the men's games, and the Unit has the best hockey team in Muscat and Mutrah. Sd/- A.G.T. Matthews, 7/1/46. 10. Rations . The scale of rations remains as before and is considered by the M .O. to be sufficient. Atta (no rice available) l-J- lbs. Dhal 2 ozs. Ghee 1 oz. Salt i oz. Onions 2 ozs. (approximately) Fish 2 ozs. Wood 2|- lbs. The extra messing still remains at As.3/- per man which is just sufficient to cover the cost of Misala etc. The following Kg vegetables are supplied from our garden at Ruwi during the cold weather; Cauliflower; Knon-khol; Cucumberr Brinjal; Cabbage; Pumpkin; Chillies; Ladies fingers; Tomatoes; Melons; Spinach Garlic; Turnips; Radish; Beetroot; Beans. As reported before the men do not care for many of the vegetables other than Radish, Brinjal. Ladies fingers. However I insti tuted a 'parade 11 and each man had to eat one raw tomato a day. This according to the M.O. has had a definite beneficial effect. It appears now that the men are becoming more 'green vegetable minded'. As meat is prohibitive it is proposed as soon as the opportunity occurs to start breeding rabbits on a large scale. This, it is hoped, will be of some use in filling in the meat deficiency. The CanteenThe Canteen supplies Milk, Tea, Sugar, Soap 3 Cloth, Cigarettes, Matches, Vests, Pants, Towels &amp;c.. at considerably lov/er prices than those current inlhe bazaar. It is proposed in the coming year to build a new Canteen in which the men can obtain Tea, Coffee and Biscuits. A number of games have been purchased for use in this Canteen and it is hoped that it will be well patronised and keep men away from the bazaar. This is more than likely as they will be allowed monthly credit which is not available to them in the bazaar. 11. Sports . P.T. is now carried out daily. Hockey and Basket Ball are played regularly. The Hockey team has now won the Consulate Club Cup three times running. A seven a side Hockey Tournament has been organised by the Maqbul Club but owing to the 'professionalism' being shown by other teams in the matter of holding up games in order to see how many points are required before two teams of another Club can make certain of winning the cup it can hardly be called an unqualified success. The Annual Sports Meeting has had to be postponed until the 9th January, 194-6. 12. Buildings . No major repairs have been necessary, but a number of alterations are proposed in the coming year. We unfortunately suffer from a lack of masons and the cost of employing outside labour is prohibitive. T^ith the end of the war it is hoped that materials will be more easily available, particularly cement and copper gauze wire netting. It is proposed to carry out extensive alterations to the existing kitchens. Oil cookers have been ordered from Ordnance. A small house has been built on the beach at Wataiyah for the use of officers, where they can take two or three days leave for shooting and bathing. A few days away from Bait-al- Falaij appears to be good for them both physically and mentally. Should the Canteen continue to make as much profit as it is making at present, it is proposed to build another small hut somewhere on the beach where men ordered sick leave by the M .O. can be sent in small parties for a week or so. At present when men are ordered sick leave they have to go to Muscat or Matrah where they spend their time in Coffee shops and do not benefit at all, in addition to which they, in all probability, contract a fresh disease.QHAPTaR IX ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KHORRAMSHAHR CONSULATE FOR THE YEAR 1945.

II.-- BRITISH INTERESTS Trade.— There is now an embryo Trade Section in this Consulate, for the promotion of British and Indian trade in this area. It is in the charge of H.M. Vice-Consul, and its further development depends on the receipt from India and the United Kingdom of trade lists, catalogues, pamphlets, samples, etc. Its present functions are limited to answering questionnaires as to the local demand for particular manufactures. There has been an almost complete absence of British and Indian goods in the market, due chiefly to the fact that orders are not accepted owing to the short supply position in both countries. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company .-- The Order-in-Council, under the Defence Regulations of 1939, preventing the Company^ employees from leaving Iran without the permission of H.M.Ambassador, Tehran, was rescinded on October 1st. The withdrawal relieved H .m. Consul of the very unpleasant task of dealing with discontented and recalcitrant employees. In practice, only the Britishers were affected by the Order, owing to transport and recruitment difficulties, and there were no cases of Indians being held to their posts against their will, even though they came under the provisions of the Order. Apart from this, and the almost universal demand for married quarters, most of the employees appeared reasonably contented: they were adequately paid, and the food and clothing made available to them under the Company^ rationing system kept them better off than they would have been in their homelands. Projected operations include the provision of accommodation for the Company's greatly increased staff, and extensive new drilling operations in the 'Fields' area, at Agha Jari. Ill'-tm MZ - 2 - III.-- FOREIGN INTERESTS Representation.The Iraqi Vice-Consul still is the only other foreign civil representative in the area. This appointment was held by Mr. Khalil Ibrahim from the beginning of the year till the 21st October, and thereafter by Mr. P.D, Azoo, the Head Clerk, who officiated till the end of the year. Trade.-- About the only imported goods to be seen on the market throughout the year were those of American manufacture: beauty preparations, sun goggles, etc. were always available, and immediately on the cessation of hostilities with Japan, fresh supplies of these together with large consignments of glassware, oil lamps and second-hand winter clothing arrived from the U.S.A. The arrival of the clothing was timely, and kept prices down to a reasonable level. Russian crockery and sugar appeared in some shops at the end of the year. Significance however attaches to the frequent visits to Khorramshahr of the Russian Consul at Ahwaz, who on these occasions showed great interest in the newly-built jetties at Sentab, and who went to no little trouble to obtain figures of imports from Britain, India and the u .S.A. At the very end of the year, a branch of the American-Iraqi Shipping Company, whose main office is at Basrah, was established at Khorramshahr for the purpose of shipping away all surplus U.S. Army supplies. It is understood, however, that it will remain permanently as a trade rival to British shipping agencies. IV.— LOCAL. GOVERMENT Ustandar (Governor-General).-- The appointment was held by Aghai Misbah Fatemi throughout the year. Farmandar (Governor).-- Khorramshahr and Abadan continued to be separate governorates, under civil and military authority respectively. Aghai Hassan Mateen remained Governor of Khorramshahr throughout the year, except for the period from 3Cth June to 27th November when he was absent on leave, and during which time Aghai Mahmud Darwish, Mayor of Khorramshahr, officiated. Sarhang (Colonel) Mohamed Sadiq Daulatshahi who has been Military Governor of Abadan since late in 1943, retained the appointment throughout the year. He was the object of anonymous complaints and of Press attacks on the score of corruption, from which he was acquitted by a Court of Inquiry'set up in January. Owing^to continued libellous attacks, he on more than one occasion threatened to resign, but was persuaded to remain, while attempts were made to silence his detractors. Throughout the period of his charge he has proved to be helpful and cooperative. Since the end of the War, the question has been discussed as to whether the Military Governorate should be abolished, or not; it was decided to allow it to continue at least until the Allied forces evacuate the country. fe i'-l SinceFarmandar (continued) Since its inception in 1943, no separate budget has been sanctioned for the Military Governorate. Judiciary.Aghai Ashraf Ahmedi held the appointment of President of the Abadan Court throughout the year. Police .— Sarhang (Colonel) Vighar was Chief of Police, Abadan, throughout the year. Sarwan (Captain) Kussain Nikokar was Chief of Police, Khorramshahr, throughout the year. Gendarmerie .— Sarwan (Captain) Reza Hakimi was Chief of Gendarmerie, Khorramshahr and Abadan, till the month of July, when he was succeeded by Captain Eamimi. Health .— Dr. Reza Nighabat held the appointment of Quarantine and Medical Officer throughout the-year. In April, a severe epidemic of typhus took a heavy toll of life in the district of Shadegan. A noticeable decrease in the number of mosquitos is probably due to the spraying with crude oil, of all the creeks and stagnant pools in Khorramshahr, by the Americans, v Municipality .— Aghai Mahmud Darwish was Mayor of Khorramshahr till the 28th November, when he was succeeded by Aghai Shukrullah Manuchchri. In April, the Central Government sanctioned the levy of new,taxes by the Municipality. The Karun embankment, begun in January, was completed by the end of the year. In the Spring, the construction of a new drainage system, and the asphalting of roads was begun. The end of the year saw the completion of the asphalting of most of the lanes inside the town, and of the pavements only along the main streets. Trade and Commerce .— The institution of a Chamber of Commerce for Khorramshahr and Abadan was sanctioned by the Central Government. In May, elections to a nine- member committee took place, and Aghai Abraishamkar was elected President. The Chamber's first meeting was held in June. In July, shares were floated for the formation of a trading company, to be named 'The Khuzistan Commercial and Engineering Company', which would deal mainly with imports and whose endeavour it would be to centralise trade in Khuzistan. Theire is still no indication that the required capital has been subscribed. Education .— Aghai Ali Asghar Fayyaz was Director of Education throughout the year. In April, the Education Department closed one of its primary schools from lack of accommodation. The re-opening- 4 - Education (contimied) The re-opening of schools after the summer holidays was delayed for lack of teachers. In June, the merchants of the town formed a committee, of which the Director of Education became a member, to examine the prospects of improving the condition of the schools of Khorramshahr. It was decided that two new schools should be built. No provision for teachers appears to have been made. V.— MILITARY Allied Forces .— The only British Military forces in Iran are those stationed at Ahwaz and in this area, and the end of the year saw the transfer of authority from the British to the Persians in a very advanced stage. This transfer process has been going on ever since the end of the Japanese War, and is being carried out gradually and systematically in accordance with pre-arranged and agreed plans so that the Persians will be in complete control of the area at the time when the British troops finally evacuate the country through this port. On the 30th December, the American forces completed the evacuation of Persia by moving out of Khorramshahr. They left behind a party of 20 men attached to the American-Iraqi Shipping Company, and 70 in the Air Base at Abadan, all of whom now wear - civilian clothes. It is understood that the aerodrome is now being operated by T.W.A. under a temporary agreement arrived at between the United States Government and the Persians, to facilitate the repatriation of American troops from India and the Far East, along this route. No final decision as to the fate of the Karun Hull Bridge has been reached, but it is expected that it will be dismantled and towed away to Basrah. The Persians wish it to remain, but the problem of its maintenance arises, and the Anglo-Iranian Gil Company are not interested. Moreover, administrative difficulties arise over its sale to the Persians by the British, as the material was received under Lend-Lease. Iranian Army .— In April, a battalion of about 400 officers and men arrived from Ahwaz as a permanent garrison for Khorramshahr, Its Commanding Officer is Major Rashid Nadirkhani. At present, the Garrison is accommodated in the former Persian Naval Base at Khorramshahr. Iranian Navy.— The Naval Base at Khorramshahr, which was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in August 1941 and transferred to the British Military authorities in mid- 1945 for use as a hospital, was handed over to the Persians on December 22nd. Owing to the non-existence of a Persian Naval administration, the hand-over was conducted with representatives of the Persian Ministry of War. AtVI - 5 - Iranian Naw (continued) At about the same time a number of the ex-Navy 1 s river craft and the tug 'Neyrou' were returned. Further restitution of vessels is to follow as soon as re conditioning has been completed. All this has led to expectations of the Persian Navy's revival. On the 8th of July, the Steam Yacht 'Ivy' sank at her moorings alongside the Naval Base jetty, its hull having rotted from disuse and lack of repair. Its salvage was fixed as a Naval responsibility, but eventually, at the end of the year, the Admiralty came to the decision that salvage operations would not be undertaken by them because they would be uneconomical. The Persians are now considering the sale of the vessel as scrap. Security t — Widespread pilferage of commercial and. military cargoes continued, as also incidents of hooliganism. The former has been kept in check by the activities of the Port Security authorities, aided by the Field Security Section, Hooliganism was dealt with by expelling under Military Governorate Law, many of the loafers and other undesirables from the town. In about the middle of the year, robberies in the European residential areas of Abadan had so increased in number, and became so daring in character, that the question of establishing a corps of special constables, recruited from among the European employees of the Company, was considered. The proposal was dropped however, owing to administrative and practical difficulties. The departure of Allied troops from Persia, and the inadequacy of the Police and Gendarmerie forces in this area, are likely to encourage an increase in thefts and smuggling, in the towns, and of ^brigandage on the trunk roads which run mostly through tribal territory. To counter this threat, it has been decided that in the interim period while the Police and Gendarmerie forces are being brought up to their required strength, the Persian military forces should be used to buttress them; and, to ensure co-ordination of the activities of these three Services, the General Officer Commanc.ing, Kiiuzistan Army Division, has been appointed as the co-ordinating authority in the matter of security in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company f s areas and in the event of operations. Smuggling and piracy, of the latter of which there were a few incidents in the vicinity of Gusba, at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab, were sought to be countered by the establishment of the International River Patrol, which is composed of a ^ew motor launches^ each of which comprises a crew of Iraqi and Persian Police and Customs personnel, commanded by a British Military Policeman. At the beginning of December, there came to light a quite unexpected source for the illegal acquisition of arirs; the crev/s of American merchant vessels visiting Abadan from Far Eastern ports were discovered to be selling locally, Japanese weapons which they had been given as souvenirs or purchased at places like Singapore. A number of these weapons were seized by the Field Security Section in the act of being sold, and the control measures which have since been taken, have ensured the drying up o source of arms traffic.- 6 - VI.— TRIBAL SITUATION Throughout the year, the tribes of this area were remarkably quiet. This fortunate state of affairs may be attributed to the presence of the Allied ^ occupation troops, and to the employment •they afforded the local inhabitants. It is difficult to predict to what degree security will be affected when these restraining and palliative influences are removed. The year was only barely uneventful however, for on January 10th this year. Shaikh Abdullah, the fourth and slightly demented son of the late Shaikh Khazal Khan (formerly Shaikh of Mohommerah) ilegally entered Khorram- shahr from Iraq with a following of armed retainers, and established himself in one of his father^ old palaces at Failiyeh, after evicting the four gendarmes who were stationed there. However, on receiving no rally from the local tribes, and finding the Persian force, which the General Officer Commanding, Khuzistan Army Division, had sent against him with commendable promptitude, to be too strong for him, Abdullah withdrew the same night. His precipitate retreat was probably also caused by receipt of the news that Iraqi troops were taking up positions along the frontier to effect his arrest should he try to re-enter Iraq. Abdullah therefore sought sanctuary in Kuwait. The attack was not altogether a surprise, for reports were received in December that Abdullah was agitating among the Iraq tribes on the border for action which would effect the restoration of the Khazal Family^ fortunes in Khuzistan. It was considered however that Abdullah had no real following, and that his was only a hare-brained scheme which would, at most, prove only of nuisance value if it was carried out. Nevertheless, all precautions were taken against such an eventuality.

I&lt;0 REVIEW PERSIAN SIDE . 1. The most ifflportant event of the year has been the transfer of the Residency from Bushlre to Bahrain and the separation of the functions of Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and Consul-General, Bushlre. The transfer began in May and was completed by the end of September. 2 # In the middle of the year the activities of the Tudeh party gave rise to serious disturbances in Khorramshahr and strikes in Bushire* In September the tribes of the coastal belt around Bushire Joined the tribes of the hinterland in a rising against the Persian Government and took over control of the whole of the Fars Province, No attacks by tribesmen on British subjects or British interests were reported. By the end of the year tribal interest flagged and the rebel leaders came to terms with the Central Government| who gradually re established their authority in Bushire and elsewhere. With the establishment of tribal control in Bushire f the Tudeh party there disappeared. In Khorramshahr by the end of the year its open activities had ceased but it still existed underground. ,3. PQLmCA}, AHAB 3I13E No casualties occurred amongst the Rulers of the Gulf States and except for a few minor disturbances on the Trucial Coast all have enjoyed peace and a reasonable measure of prosperity throughout the year. In Bahrain and Kuwait both of which enjoyed a substantial income from oil royalties a start has been made on important works of public utility in spite of the shortage of materials. There is room for a great deal of improvement in both places. The Sultan of Muscat spent most of the year at his capital and left for Dhofar in December. He is still intent on his plans for unifying the interior of Oman under his control as soon as the Imam who is old and feeble dies. * 4. ull • The Kuwait Oil Company formally opened their oil loading terminal at Fahahil in June when the first shipment of oil was made. The Company have since then been in regular production and are expanding their activities rapidly. In the latter half of the year the Shaikh of Kuwait announced his intention of receiving bids for a Concession of his share in the Neutral Zone. Several oil companies have approached him with offers, but he has not yet arrived at any decision. In Bahrain, the Bahrain Petroleum Company have continued to expand and their production increased to 26,000 barrels a day by the end of the year. Exploration work within the additional area was resumed towards the end of the year and the drilling of one structure hole was completed. In April 1946, Petroleum Concessions, Limited, re opened their Dukhan Camp in Qatar and plans have been made to speed up production. January 1949 has provisionally been fixed as the date for the first export. Meanwhile arrangements are rapidly being made for laying down pipe-lines and building roads and Jetties. On the Trucial Coast, Petroleum Concessions, Limited, have carried out a geological survey along the coast and in the interior. In Muscat, Petroleum Concessions, Limited, carried out a survey for water along the Batinah Coast at the request of^t^rfrlp- page 2 # t U iJ an 0 { aJld also sent; a representative to meet the bultan at Dhofar to discuss future operations In that Province. 6.

They have closed their hostel in Cairo and withdrawn their students owing to the subversive Influences to which they were subjected there# Education is making rapid strides in Kuwait under an Egyptian director. 6. COMMERCIAL . \ •j. jj • The shipping position in the Gulf remained most unsatisfactory throughout the year. The British India Steam Navigation Company hope to add two fast new motor-boats to their Gulf Service early in the new year, and it is hoped that the situation will then improve. Thanks to the assistance of the Government of India and the British Middle East Supply Mission the supply of essential foodstuffs to the Gulf States has been well maintained and there have been no serious shortages. Food rationing and price control measures are still enforced wherever possible. Consumer goods in increasing quantities are coming in from the United States of America and the United Kingdom* The Imperial Bank of Iran has obtained an exclusive concession to open a branch in Dubai• The branch was opened for business on the 12th October.

(c) BJSHIHiS IJ111CIPALITY . Husain Shabankarah has remained Mayor of Bushire throughout the year except for a short period. Apart from the Mayor who is appointed by Government and paid out of Uunicipal funds, no member of the Municipality ha3^any real power. As a result, the affairs oi the Municipality have not progressed, xiuch money is stated to have been spent but the results are not apparent. (d ) v/agko a.itd coo j.' ql 1 .ul ■/1 - a . As a result of lack of supervision, exhorbitant profiteering and the high rate of interest on all loans^ prices of all commodities especially imported goods have shown little tendency to drop, and in some cases have even risen. ./ages have risen sharply, partly due to delayed action to meet the higher cost of living and^ partly due to pressure by the Tudeh party. Cost of living allowances etc. given to employees of the Persian Government now almost equal their pay. (e) The corruption and inefficiency of the local Administration (especially the Central Government Dep artments) is only equalled by the apathy of almost all the local inhabitants and their inability to complain against misgovernment. Section IV. Local Affairs. ^ -i r I During the period up to the middle of September, there was a steady increase in tne activii-ies o^. uhe Tudeh party, and a corresponding decline in the power of all other parties. At the start of the year the Tudeh party had little influence and few supporters and their activit ies were mostly confined to scurril-ious aotacivs in loc^l L / papers andpapers and leaflets against the British Government, the material used being the familiar claims to Bahrain and blaming the British for the high cost of living. A strike in the local cotton mills, which was probably fostered by them, gave the Tudeh their chance 5 and the demands which were put forward by Tudeh agitators who came from ohiraz specially for the purpose, were all met. This enhanced their reputation, and they looked like being successful in upsetting the dock workers, when the agitators had to leave for Shiraz to assist in the strikes tnere. .ieanwhile the inhabitants, espec ially zhe tribal leaders realised that to remain idle would only result in complete domination by the Tudeh party. Their revolt which is described below took place and that for the present, has meant the end of the Tudeh party in this consular area. The elections to the Majlis, if they ever take place, which is considered dpubtful by the local inhabitants, will probably be fought'without any Tudeh candidates. The revolt ended with the tribal party in complete control, and it was clear that it would be used to form the basis of a new political party in the area. ThJ^s in fact did occur, but subsequently it was merged wii'ioVx, one might almost say submerged by - the party of the Prime Minister. The year ended therefore with no Tudeh party , with the Tribal party almost in effective and showing signs of internal disagreement. and the Prime field. 'v b j x'.. i . .;iinister f s party as the only one in the In February the Ghahkutahi family who had previously been distinguished for their anti-British record, and who had been expelled by ^eza bhah to Azerbaijan, returned and.with the assistance of Naser Khan Kashgai, seized their land in the Balook-i-Bushkan from liais Ghulam Hazmi. At the time this caused much excitement, especially as the land had been leased to Ghulam. Hazmi by the Persian Gov ernment, but complete inactivity by the Persian Government, lack of support by other tribal chiefs to Ghulam Hazmi and finally the tribal revolt, have so occupied public attention that it is now unlikely that the Chahkutahis position will be disturbed. In March, the dispute between Fathullah Khan Haiat Daudi and Mohammad Ali Liravi was settled amicably and the troops stationed in the area were eventually removed. No further signs of this quarrel have been apparent, and with Fathullah Khan in almost undisputed leadership of the coastal tribes, and very much preocc upied with more important matters, it is unlikely to recur. No other important events took place, until in June, when Hiait Daudi succeeded in forming the Tribal Union in which most of the tribal leaders of the Consular Area became members. Apart from presenting and if necessary settling disputes between the members, the real object of the Union was to oppose the influence of the Tudeh party as weil as to represent the tribes in matters of common interest in their dealings with the Persian Government. This success was followed up by Haiat Daudi, who went to Shiraz to negotiate agreements between the Tribal Union and the tribes of Fars, especially the Kashgais, and to persuade them, if possible to join the Union. At first he had little success, as the Kashgais were pre- . occupied, and Qawam ul ;.iulk was in ichran. In /September. September, however, it became clear that the Kashgais had had one of their usual changes of heart and were willing to co-operate with the Union. As a result of this added strength the policy of the Union W3s changed almost overnight from a peaceful one to that of armed revolt against the Government, The aims of the revolt were not and are still not clear, but undoubtedly were chiefly directed agairrst the Tudeh party, ■ nd to a lesser extent against excessive interference from Tehran in local affairs. As the revolt progressed, personal ambitionf and desire for power* among the leaders did much to shape policy and hinder proress. The revolt in this consular area was of short duration. It commenced on September 19th and by midnight' of the 28th all Government forces in Bushire had surrendered. Those at at Khormuj surrendered on October 1st. Not long after wards the Kashgais and others captured Kazerua, and opened negotiations with Government. These proceeded slowly and Bushire leaders were not often involved, as ^ they, had devoted themselves more to administering Bushire than to thinking of the future. In fact it-was at first doubtful if the agreement which was eventually announced on the radi oa was applicable to the coastal area. Later it became clear that it was, and a commission^visited Bushire to settle details. Since the ©ain points of agreement were still unknown, and as far as could be , ascertained were never reduced to writing in any sense at all binding on either party, the commission achieved very little. Nevertheless, it appeared that a genuine settlement had been achieved including some measures of transference of power from Tehran to Fars, and with the return to Bushi :*e of the Governor, * the dispersal of tribal forcesjHaiat Daudi r ent to Bhiraz with the object of assisting in the establishment of a provincial council, selection of candidates for the Majlis, etc. Not long- after he came hurrying back. The success of the Persian Government in AzerDa—jan, and the renewed, coniidence of the army, had alarmed the tribal leaders who had already allowed personal ambition and private jealous ies to' undermine their unity and v^ho feared reprisals which they were sn no longer in a position to resist. As a result the whole position of the tribes vis a vis the Government weakened at once. One demand of the Prime minister was met after another, including even the dissolution of the tribal party, and the adherence of it's members of the Democrat party of the Frime Minister and the outcome was uhe . loss ol al -l chat had been gained by the revolt. But that apparently was not enough. New and more difficult demands were made by the bhiraz army commander who appeared to have taken ohe place of the Governor General. Such was the position at the end of the year, but whatever the final outcome of the affair it is clear even now that the revolt has accentuated old feelings and brought about new influences which will undoubtedly affect future events. These may be summar ised as (a) The interdependence of Fars and the Bushire coastal area, with Shir a z as tho. Muagfr much the most important town in the area. (b) The advantages of unity among the tribes, and the ease with which, provided they are united, and acu jointly and with determination, they can impose their wishes on the Central Government. Conversely the ease with which they can be over-/awed when not so united. (c) The distrust, one might almost say dislike, of all /tMngs whichthings which smack of central control, and the desire of the inhabitants, both tribal and urban, to havealarger share in the administration of their own locality. (c) TRADa. AND Trade in Bushire has been almost at a standstill throughout the year. Many of the merchants who were established in Bushire during its times of prosperity have left, and of those remaining most are too old to undertake new ventures or jeopardise the capital which will suffice to keep them until they die. As a result money is very dear, and this together with Central Government control, which succeeds in fettering all but Tehran merchants, has prevented any real effort to put Bushire commerce on its feet again. The recent relaxation of control over foreign trade has not yet made any ap reciable difference, and until the postal and shipping services improve it is difficult to see how any appreciable improvement can be effected, in theory, ships of the B.I.S.N. Coy. call at Bushire with mails to and from India and Iraq every 10 days or fortnight, but in actual practise it is found that these ships arrive most irregularly, and without adequate prior notice, and often are unable to take on any passengers or cargo. It has not been uncommon for there to be periods of 6 weeks with no sea nail. Air mail services showed some promise but if anything have deteriorated during the latter part of the year, and ceased entirely for some time. One or two ships of Messrs. 3trick and Coy. have called at Bushire en route to or from England, and undoubtedly there is plenty of scope for trade between England and Bushire. There has been some talk of starting a new shipping Coy. for carr- . iage of passengers and light cargo in the Gulf and to India.but this plan is bred more of desperation than of careful thought, as a Persian Shipping Coy. would be most unlikely to be a success.

The IStemedieh Cotton and Spinning Mill continues to produce cloth, and though production has decreased and expenditure increased following Tudeh activities, the continued high price of cloth has enabled the Coy. to make good profits. It is now proposed to set up another mill in Bushire, to be managed by quite a sep arate company, and plans for the purchase of machinery from England are being made. Bushire Electric cov . A new company has been formed by Mr. Agar, managing director of the Ktemedieh Mill, and machinery for it is now being erected. It is understood that the old electric company is going out of business entirely. It is claimed that the new company will in addition to producing ice, provide large cold storage facilities, l/hat purpose they will serve is difficult to foresee. Bushire Prinkin;: .,at er supoly. Bushire continues to obtain drinking water from this scheme, but it is not clear how long this will continue. It is understood that there is'no money left from the original grant, that repairs will have to be made soon and^ that unless the scheme is taken over by the Municipality or a^ proper company, piped supply will never be made to the houses /in Bushire^■Px^DIX I . Notes on the working of the Residency Dispensary Bushire for the year 1946. Residency Surgeon:- lajor A .L.Greenway v .3,jS . was in charge up to 16th November 1946. Assistant Burgeon:- Dr.R.iiiasey for the whole year. Number of outpatients treated was 36166. Number of minor operations performed was 323. The health of Residency staff was good. The chief ca^se of sickness among them was malaria. The health of the Public was as usual bad. This is due to practically no anti-malaria work and the insanitary condition, of the town. The lanes are narrow and dirty and the houses badly ventilated, i^laria and diseases of the eye are most prevalent, 3d.

BRITISH INTERESTS j- i • ~'j : ■ r . 0' (a) There was practically no trade throughout the year ovdng to the delays of post war reconversion in industries and lack of shipping space® (b) The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company^ Throughout the period under report there was no stock shortage anywhere in the province of Kerman. This was parti- -cularly gratifying in the case of lubricating oil of which there is a world shortage. The Lingeh Agency was re-established as from the 7th May 194-6 and the Lar Agency was reopened on the 16th September. Owing to availablity of ample transport, freight rates were reduced. The Chief Distributing Engineer visited Kenan and Bandar Abbas towards the end of the year with a view to choosing Suitable sites for bulk storage depots, filling stations, garages and houses for their staff, and it is hoped before long to have bulk oil facilities in this area.

The Hospital continued to render most valuable service to the community whose patients come from the remotest towns in the province. Their work which affects about 75% of the local sick could be greatly extended but the Hospital have always been 5 hampered by a lack of funds in spite of which, however, they have performed admirable work through the year.^ndofiKrBoec f3.

LOCAL GOVERir.SNT, (a) Governor General. iiqai Mehdi Shahrukh held the post of Governor General from the beginning of the yearjuntil the 20th of June when he was recalled to Tehran® During his period of office he showed great timidity in handling the disputes which aro^e over elections for the Provincial Council and a lack of enterprise or interest in the affairs of the province® The Tudeh Party in Kerman also thri^ved as a result of weakness which he displayed towards them. In his absence Aqai Adl Isfandyari, the Farmandar, officiated as - T staiidar in addition to his own duties® About the beginning of October Sartip Ali Qadar, the G®0,C., received instructions from Tehran to carry out the duties of the Ustandar until the arrival of the Ustandar designate, Aqai Reza Hikmat ( Sardar Fakhir )• Shortly after, Sartip Qadar was obliged to hand over the affairs of the Ustandari to Sactip Vahdati as the former was busily engaged in supervising the despatch of troops to quell the tribal revolt in the Shiraz area® Vahdati officiated for a day or two after which he handed over to Aqai Hikmat who ar 'ived in Kerman on the 12th October and remained unti-i the end of the year® Aqai Hikmat was fortunate in arriving in Kerman after the influence of the Tudeh Party was dm the wane® As a result of his representaticoas /regarding the bad water situation in the province the Shah granted a sum of two million rials to improve the water supply in Kerman and Baluchistan, The Ustandar visited Tehran twice'by air during the year to obtain instructions in connection with the Democrat Party and the holding of elections for the 15th Majlis® (b) Farmandar® Aqai Adl Isfandyari ( Adl-us-Saltanih ) held the post of Farmandar, Kerman, throughout the year. (c) Economic and Finance Department . Aqai Moosa Khattatan arrived in Kerman on the 17th January in the capacity of Director of Finance, 8th Ustan, which post he held throughout the year® He had strong Tudeh sympathies and gave the best posts in his department to those of similar views® Between the 19th September and the 25th October he was in Tehran on leave® Aqai Jabbari remained as Head of the local Finance Department until the first week of August after which he was recalled to Tehran for his Tudeh sympathies. Aqai Hussain Ali Khan Farzan remained as Head of the Economic Department and deslt with grain collection and the distribution of sugar and tea throughout the year® , A case of embezzlement involving a sum of 4-0,000.— tomans was discovered in the Finance Depertment about the middle of the year and a commission was ciesp tcned fr m Tehran to in— -vestigate and report® One person who was reported to have been in possession of information which would hav^i the offenders to justice was found dead in suspicious circumstances and was said to have been murdered by them. The case is still under investigation in the local courts® (^) Apricultural Department ® Aqai Muhsin Sheikh-ul-Islami held the post of Manager of the Agricultural Department until the 15th November when he was transferred to Tehran and relieved by Aq«i Muhandis Mustafa s hah A lai who took over charge on the 27th November. Though timely rains fell in the winter months and the wheat and barley crops were regarded as average, the prices of these grains remained comparatively high during the year. No ^rops are reported to have been damaged by 1 sen *( rust ). The frtit crop was good. Cotton® The cotton crop was excellent and sufficient to meet all local demands. IOpium Cultivation of opium was prohibited since Aprils and from the 22nd November its sale to tho public was stopped by the C-overnment. It is still easily obtainable but the price has risen rrom 10 rials to 22 rials per miskal and is still soaring. Pistachios .. The pistachio crop is stated to be the best for some years. Last year a maund of 3 kilos fetched 280/- rials for the best quality, whereas this year it has dropped to 100/-o Local merchants have received enquiries from the U.S.A. for large orders, (e) Education Demrtment 6 Aqai Mehdi Kesravi held the post of Director of Education until 16th May when he received orders of transfer# , Aqai Ali Naki Bahmanyar officiated until the arrival of Aqai Zeinul Abedin Hikmat on the 17th September. Being a r^bid Tudeh sympathiser he immediately set about giving the best appoj^-ments to others with similar views regardless of their capacity to hold these posts, snd causing the transfer of non-Tadehs to other provinces or to junior and inferior posts in outlying districts. The mosi glaring example of this was the removal of Aqai Yadullah Mir Kusaini, the popular and efficient Headmaster of the local Pahlavi school who was replaced by a junior member of the Department, Established teachers were threatened with reduction to inferior posts and pupils faced with the prospect of being failed in their examinations if they did not join the Tudeh movement. Some succumbed to the threat but many held out. Eventually when school hours were devoted to the reading out of Tudeh.propaganda to the pupils many parents were enraged and strong representations were made to the Prime Minister, At first it did not produce the desired result owing, it is said to Hikmat^s relationship to the Ustandar, but towards the end of the year Hikmat was recalled to Tehran. During this period conditions in the Department and schools were chaotic and the administration of the schools suffered a severe setback, (f) National Bank, Aqai Reza Quli Ameri held charge as manager until the 3rd Msy when he left for Meshed on leave. Aqai Fath Ali Shaar, the Assistant Manager of the Bank officiated as Manager until the 26th December when he was relieved by Ali Asghar Yavari, (g) iigricultur'al Bank, Aqai Sayed Jawad Moinzadeh held the post of Manager throughout the year.

Sarhang Hurmoz Givian remained as Chief of Police throughout the year. In the earlier stages of the Tudeh movement when the Government's policy was not known his attitude towards them was considered too mild but after a short visit to Tehran in July he changed and took the strongest measures against the Tudeh on all occasions. Throughout the Tudeh troubles he was ably and loyally supported by Captain Hishmati, his assistant. Sarhang Givian successfull^rounded up a gang of burglars who for some time had been troubling the townsfolk and recovered most of the property stolen. At his suggestion, the Central Government have provided a sum of 20,000 tomansfor the construction of a new prison. Work on the new prison started in-the middle of the year, Sarhang Givian is a friendly and cooperative officer. (J) iosts anc Tole..;ra]:hs. Aqai Mustafa Siruspoor held the post of Director of Posts and Telegraphs until June when he left for Tehran on leave. Work in the Department deteriorated during his period of office. Telegrams were frequently delivered very late and when the accumulation of them was more than his staff coula aeal with they were sent th their destinations hj post. He cooperated freely with the Tudeh Party and was accused of disclosing offi- -cial and public telegrams to them. As the result of many com- -plaints he was recalled to Tehran ana Aqai Ahmad oaari, a former Director, took charge on the 9th September and remained in office until the end of the year. (k) Ijealth Department . Aqai Ali Akbar Vakili held charge of the post of Chief Medical Officer, Kerman, until July 10th when he was arrested by the Police and sent to Tehran for his Tudeh ictivities. Before his dep rture he appointed Dr. Seyed Jawad Kahhari to officiate in his place but the Ustandari appointed Dr. Llohammad Nav/abi as they ruled that a man under arrest was , not qualified to appoint his successor. As Dr, Yezdi was at the time Minister for Health and a Tudeh supporter he confirmed officially the appointment of Dr. Kahhari. During his ove^long tenure js ead of the 3ihdarli he had ruineo. one medic aj. services of the province and the majority of those serving under him were glad of' his removal, Vakili was only allowed to return to'his former post in Kerman after he had given the fullest assurances to exclude politics from his duties and :* ^assocllte himself from the Tudeh, which he did. He returned to Kerman in his former capacioy on .he 12tn December a d-A.s illusioned and very subdued man. The local Health Department received funds' amounting/to 20,000 tomans towards the construction of a Government Hospital in Sirjan. The Shah contributed 170,000 tomans towards the construction of a 60 bed hospital in Kerman the foundations of which were laid over three years ago. It is reported that during the year under re- -view large quantities of drugs of the Health Depfrtment have been sold to loc^l druggists and the proceeds misappropriated by individual members of the department, (1) v(1) Munici i.ality&gt; 4qai ^dl Isfandyari, the Farmandar, conducted the affairs of the I/I \micipality, in addition to his own duties, until the end of April when ^-qai Sadik Nawab &lt;f Yezd, arrived in Kenyan in the capacity of Chief of the Municipality, Hie Municipality have for long been short of funds much to the detriment of the town but with the help of Dr. Bakai, leader of the local Democrat Party, Nawab succeeded in getting the long overdue budget sanction^in Tehran. The imposition of a tax of 2/- tomans per kharvar on all commodities imported or in transit have assisted the Municipality to meet their liabilities to some extent. Attempts at asphalting a portion of the main road in the town are in progress. All other roads in the town are in a bad state of repair anc ^ps^jtdxKK is still primitive. The proportion of barley in Government bread was reduced from 30% to 20&gt; in the last quarter of the year. (m) Gendarnarie. Sarhang Hassan Goodarzi was Officer Commanding, Gendarmarie until February, when he was recalled to Tehran. Numerous complaints were made of his increasing venality and in April Sarhang Gulriz was deputed from Tehran to report on him. He found the charges were fully substantiated and reported accordingly to Tehran, Goodarzi left Kerman for Tehren on 14-th March. All officers ivho kept him supplied with money were shown favour in the form of good appointments. Those who failed ?;ere de-graded, and discipline and efficiency were affected. Goodarzi 1 s relief Sarhang Zia ud Din Ishki arrived in Kerman on the 9th June. Ishki is a friendly officer but has done very little to make the Kerman-Bandar Abbas and Kerman-Yezd roadjsafe for travellers the former &amp;£ has been the scene of many holdups. There are strong rumours that the Gendarmarie are hand in glove with Murad Ali Murad, the Buchakchi bandit who has been at large for several years. VI. Military. Sarhang Sayid Sadik Aaizi was G.O.C. Kerman until 19th June when he was relieved by Sartip Ghulam Ali Qadar who remained in charge throughout the year, oartip Qadar was a good soldier, active, a severe discipliarian and had a strong person- -ality, but this was offset by his extensive acceptance of bribes. During the Tudeh riots he was thought at first to be pro-Tudeh ow in g to certain utterances of his but later he took the strongest measures in supporting the police in restoring order, Ke handled the speedy despatch of troops to the Shiraz area during the tribal revolt with credit but his contribution towards security in the province has been little. Outwardly he was friendly and seemingly cooperative. Staff Officer. SaThang Abbas Quli Alikai was staff officer to the G.O.C. until early November after which he was placed in charge of troops sent to the disturbed areas near Shiraz. Sarhang Hussain Masrur then took his place as Staff Officer and remained in this post until the end of the year. He is a sociable ofxicer and took a great interest|in the local Officers 1 Club which civilians of all nationalities were encouraged to join. Sarhang Ali Hatemi, O.C., Kerman Depot, was recalled to Tehran in August for alleged peculation and was relieved by Sarhang Abdur Rsdaim Varzgar. Sarhang Ali Bahrami, 0,C. Artillery and Sarhang Abbas Tahmasibpoor, O.C., Military Police, were both transferred to Tehran by the G.O .C. for their alleged Tudeh sympathies. N.C.O's and other ranks show all the signs of being8. underfed and ill-cared for and their morale is decidedly low. Chief Medical Officer. Sarhang Owhadi was Chief Medical Officer until the middle of the year when he received orders of transfer and was relieved by Sarhang Seifullah Sarerai who was at the time engaged in the Military Hospital. Owhadi was an unassuming and honest officer. (n) Khurshil Millc:, In April, the Tudeh Party directed their main attacks unrelentingly against the management of the Khurshid Mills until they eventually compelled Aqai Mehdi Moinzadeh, the manager, to resign in favour of two others, Aqai Jehanbin and Aqai Taheri. Later the main source of Tudeh strength was supplied by the workers of these Mills which passed through many vicissitudes during the year. After the arrest of the Tudeh Party leaders in July the Mills have been returning painfully to normal. (o) Transport. There is ample motor transport available and freight prices are coming down steadily. Tyres and spare parts are not easy to obtain and prices remain comparatively high, VII. Security. The Kerman-Eam road was free from holdups during the period under report. Most highway robberies took place between Sirjan and Bandar iibbas and a few on the' Kerman-Yezd road and the Gendarmarie and Military authorities have done little to imprc/e matters. The following cases of robber have taken place during the year 194-6 February. The road between Baft and Sirjan became unsafe. On the 3rd a band of Buchakchi robbers attacked a party of Gendarmes proceeding to Sir j an on motorcycles. In the skirmish wmcn followed one Gendarme was wounded.

Two riflemen were killed and the third escaped, November, On about the 10th, 9 armed bandi's held up a truck coming from Bandar Abbas at Tal-i-Mohammad Khani between Hajiabad and Aliabad and carried away several bales of piecegoods, sugar and cash. The drivers assistant was shot dead and of 4- gendarmes • escorting the truck two lost their rifles# December, On the 4.th, the village of Arbabad about 30 miles from Kerman, off the Bam road, was attacked and looted by about 18 armed bandits. During the middle of the month, a caravan consisting of about 45 men and 200 camels proceeding from Khorasan to Shahdad north east of Kerman, was attacked by an armed gang. Two members of the caravan were killed and 150 camels with their loads were driven away by the robbers. Local robberies. On the 9th April, 2 armed robbers entered the quarters of a clerk of this Consulate in the small hours of the morning. They decmmped with some cash and clothing. The police showed commendable energy and within a week S arrests were made and 4» of them were identified as having commit^d a series of armed robberies in the town «n the last IS months. They also disclosed the location of certain of the robbed articles which were restored to the owners. In the month of June, the local Rug Weavers Co, re-' -ported the loss to the Police- of a carpet valued at 12,000 rials During the month of December gold and jewlry valued at about 20,000 tomans were removed from the house of Amanullah Khan Ameri by thieves, y VIII. Communications# ^qai Ghulam Reza Khan Farsan was Head of the Road Department until June when he was relieved by Aqai Muhandis Kaim iVfukami who held the post until the end of the yesr. The roads continue to be in a bad state of repair and after the ravages of the Weather only temporary repairs are effected owing to xack of funds# The roads of Kerman town are very bad indeed and hard on vehicles but it is expected thrt serious efforts at repairs will be made to a section' of the main road leading through the town, in the near future.10. (b) Kerman Landing Groimd. V Planes of Iranian Airways have been using the landing ground regularly for the last fe?? months. (c) Wireless Station. , The station is not in service but is believed to be subject to periodical tests. (d) The Military W/T Station in Bagh-i~Na3eriel|continued to function with Tehran and Isfahan throughout the year* 11, SCCTICOIC. Landlords and cultivators clai^i that though the rain- -fall was plentiful during the winter months it did not come when it was most needed, about a month before harvest, with the result that the crop of wheat and barley was not as good as it would have been # There ?;a3 no shortage however though the price was compara- -tively high. Bread in Government bakeries consisted of a mixture of 70 /O T/heat czid 30% barley. The barley content was reduced to 20^ in the last quarter of the year. This was only consumed by the poorest classes. It was found that it would be cheaper to import wheat from Sultanabad, Quia and Hamadan and certain landlords ful filled their undertakings with imported wheat.

Tiiroaghout the year relations of local officials, military authorities and others with this Consulate continued to be cordial. The Prime Ministers broadcast calling upon all Persians to avoid contact with Foreign Consular Officials and others, was at first observed but ignored towards the end of the year. The unrestricted activities of the Tudeh Party which grew in strength during the first seven months of the year caused the most serious civil disturbances which eventually paralysed the local administration, certain members of which were known to have encouraged the Tudeh and taken an active part in its campaign. During this period everything British was pilloried in their meetings and press.; the management of the A.I.O.C. relentlessly criticised and the Bakhtiari rebellion attributed to British intrigues, and anti- British propaganda reached its peak, 'ortunately, however ? in July Dr.' Ali Akbar Vakili, the local Health officer and leader of the* movement, together with four other ringleaders ^were arrested and sent to Tehran under the instructions ox the Prime i/Imis uer and subsequently the affairs of the town gradually quietened down until towrds the end of the year the Tudeh movement was completely sunoressed by Government action and imluence passed into the nands of A the Iran Democrat Party formed by the Prime Minister. The reoccupation of Azerbaijan by Government forces was hailed with satisfaction by the populace. Indian Teachers. The Indian Teachers of English in Kerman and Yezd worked well throughout the year and made great efforts to encourage as many pupils as possible to join their classes the result*of which has been reported separately.11, XI. FI. TT 3LICirY ^ MOBILE In 194-5, there were 23 Reading Rooms in the Kerman and Yezd areas. All of them were closed in November 1945 except one in Kerman and one in Yezd^ and in 1946 up to the end of Sep- -tember Publicity activities were on a greatly reduced scale. During this period small quantities of periodicals , pamphlets, newspapers and magazines lit Persian, French and English were received from the P.R.3., Tehran, for the abovenientioned Reading Rooms. These were mostly for sale but included some for free distiibution. Sales did not come up to expectations. The main publicity activity was carrie(f^through the medium of the Consul at qfc/lobile Cinema which gave regular shows throughout the year in Kerman, Sirjan. Bam, Yezd, Mahan, Rafsinjan, and in villages in the districts, also in Govern- -ment schools and Military units. This feature has always been most popular and greatly appreciated especially amongst the villagers to whom 1 talkies * are a unique and new experience. ♦ On the 5th September, instructions were received from the British Embassy, Tehran, to renew and enlarge publicity activities and the budget was also increased. The name ' Publicxfcgc Relations Bureau ' was changed to the ' British Embassy Information Department ' and reading rooms were opened in Sirjan. Bam, Rafsinjan, Mahan, Baft, Bardsir, Bayaz, and Bezenjan, for which the usual reading matter and publicity materials have been received regularly from the Information Department. With these materials, Magazines and papers for free distribution amongst Government officials and notables were also received but the major portion was for sale. Papers for free distribution were found to be short of requirements, ill publicity material was sent to out-station reading rooms about 2 to 3 times a week by post. The publication of a Daily News Bulletin consisting of the 7.4-5 a.m. B.B.C. news broadcast was unfortunately delayed until February 20th owing to the lack of a suitable radio- -set'. Photographic build-ups and miscellaneous posters received were displayed in all Reading Rooms. In November, a new Cinema Van was received from Tehran to replace the old one which was reconditioned and presented to the C.M.S. Hospital, Kerman. 3. I. CONSULAR SUB-OFFICE.

(a) T rade. ~ Most Yezdi merchants have branch offices in Bombay and Karachi but none represents any British or Indian firms. They import chiefly tea, sugar, dyes, cotton piecegoods and^spices from India. Some have applied for agencies of British manuiac i^ureis of bicycles, tyres and tubes, leather goods, cutlery ani woolen fabrics etc. and have been encouraged to address their enquiries to the Indian Government's Trade Commissioner in ^ehran.jdt&gt; 12.

(b) The market is flooded with consumer goods of American manufacture mostly crockery, metal utensils, haberdashery and hoj^ery all of which are expensive. V . LOCAL G07EHME :iT&gt; Aqai Ahmad 3adri who held the post of Farmandar for about 4- years was suspended in the first week of January and recalled to Tehran, He was relieved by Aqai Ismail Bahadur on the 8th January, 7 /ho was also recalled to Tehran and his relief Aqai Mudabir -i- Noori, arrived in Yezd on the 15th December. Sadri remained in office entirely throughaock the strong support of the Taheris and Jalilis who dominated other political parties in Yezd until the coming of the Tudeh, who worked for his removal. He was intelligent but corrupt, (2) Aqai Ismail Bahadur was Farmandar for 11 months during which the Tudeh Party reached the h&amp;ight of their power. He showed great weakness in dealing with the Tudeh, the leader of which more than once insulted him in public in the presence of large crowds. At times he made pro -Russian utterances and openly criticised the policy of the British Government. His removal was not regretted. (3) Aqai Mudabbir-i-Noori held charge as Farmandar until the end of the year. He considers he ought to be holding a more senior post and has made recommendations that lezd be raised to the status of an Ustandari. (4) Aqai :totaaa Azarbegi was appointed as officer charge of the Finance and Food Department on 19th January. Appears to be pro-British but is corrupt. in (5) After the departure on leave and subsequent transfer of Aqai Mehdi Sajjadi in May, the post of Rais-i-Dadgustari remained vacant. None, it is understoou, »vas willing to take up the post owing to fear of the Tudeh. A new incumbent, however, arrived from Tehran on the 13th November and held charge until the end of the year. (£&gt;) Major Mashallah Shakiba took charge as Head of the^ Police Department from Sarvan Sharifi on 1st May and remained in office until the end of the year. He is inefficient, lacks courage and is corrupt, and burgalaries and thefts in the town have become very common. (7) Posts and Tele graphs. during the year four different officials held the oos t of Head. of the posts and Telegraphs for short per- -icds They we .-e Aqai Mustakin, Ali-i-Daood, Abdul All Misdaki and Seliatpoor.

Aqai Attahi held the po^t until when nartly due tThis relationship with Syed Zia and partly to his Tudeh 1 intrigues he was thrown out of office.

The cost of living remains as high as a year or two ago and owing to the drought and scarcity Oa. wacer lo^ iri iga'xcn the harvest was poor and only sufficient to supply the area'^ieed for about 2 months. A large quantity of wheat had therefore to be imported from the adjoining provinces of Far 8 and Isfahan. The Government also allowed the import of 4500 tons of wheat from _ Hamad an which relieved the situation. The handloora industry which supports about 50^ of the population practically lost one Ot its main markets during the period of unrest in Azerbaijan and the three local mills are still running at a loss as a result oi the Tudeh movement,u. X. LQC^iL rOLITICAL SITUATION, The Teheri and Jalili party had for a long time dominated local affairs but soon after the transfer of Aqai Ahmad Sadri, the Farmandr, who owed his long tenure to this party local influence and prestige quickly passed into the hands of the Tudeh Tarty who grew powerful within a very short period, Mohammad Hussain Nawab and Syed Fazeli who were oponents of the Teheri- Jalili party helped the Tudeh in an attempt to eradicate the influence of that once powerful Party and succeeded, Millworkers, weavers and agriculturists etc, joined their ranks in large numbers and the udeh Party literally administered the affairs of the town and villages. Towards the middle of the year when the Prime Minister announced the formation of the Iran Democrat Party under his guidance, the Tudeh were gradually weakened and deprived of official support and finally at the end of the year all further activities of theirs were suppressed. Prominent supporters of the Tudeh went over to the Democrat Party when they found the influence of the former waning* Amongst these were Mohammad Hussain Nawab, and 3yed Fazeli, both of whom received the support from Tehran of Moosavizadeh and Hairizadeh who are reported to enjoy the favour of the Prime Minister# To increase the membership of the Democrat Party, government servants ?/ere invited officially to join its ranks and the Party has noY^ completely eclipsed the Tudeh, During the height of the power of the Tudeh Party they disrupted the public life and successfully extorted money under threats of violence from the wealthy many of whom sought sanctuary elsev/here. Though they are in eclipse no?/ it is possible that • they will emerge again as soon as opportunity offers. Though the Democrats are in power now it is thought that they are not sufficiently well organised to meet future opposition if the Qawam falls from office. Meanwhile the Tahiri- Jaiili partyfwhom the Government are opposed, remain in the back- -ground. PUBLICITY ^ M03ILii.

Postal services to and from the interior have been more or less regular although there have been periodic interrup- -tions in the telegraph service and delays in transmission. The majority of the public preferred to send their foreign mail by launch to Dubai to be forwarded from there by air mail. This was mostly due to the irregularity of the steamer service.

But in the months of November and December when imports were stopped the price rose to Rials S/- per kilo. ^ ^ Prices of most other commodities remained unchanged. VIII . PU3LIC Ex..;LTH. The year under report was comparatively healthier than the previous year. Except for a few cases of typhoid and typhus in early spring there were no cases of any other serious infectious diseases. Guinea worm infection was on a milder scale. The same was the case with malarial fever. Gastro-intestinal disorders - diarrhoea and dysentery were however more frequent in children and were responsible for at least half the deaths in their age group.

I. THE POLITICAL AGENCY. Personnel . (a) Major M.P.O'C. Tandy of the Indian Political Service held charge of the office of the Political Agency up to the 28th February when he proceeded on leave to the United Kingdom. Captain R.E.R. Bird of the Indian Political Service held charge from the 1st March to the 6th May,1946 and proceeded on leave to the United Kingdom after handing over to Major M.P.O^. Tandy who held charge until the end of the year. (b) Assistant Surgeon C.E, Hynes, I.M.D. held charge of the Government Dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Medice'l Officer throughout the year. II. THE RULING FAMILY. (a) His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir^As-Subah, K.C.S.I., K.G.I .E., maintained good health in spite of his advancing years. But for short winter^excursions into the desert for hawking he remained in Kuwait throughout the year. The American Mission doctors continued to visit him twice weekly. He has had three teeth extracted by Dr. Sharp who was flown here from Abadan for the purpose and claims that his health has improved as a result. (b) Shaikh Abdulla as Salim, C.I.E.continued to administer the Finance and Supply Departments throughout the year. Towards the end of the year various discrep ancies in the Supply Departments accounts^have been revealed^ investigations are still proceeding. These disclosures have somewhat tarnished the reputation of Shaikh Abdulla as Salim who is regarded by all as except ionally honest and it is becoming evident that one man,even if he were of excexrbional ability, could not be expected to discharge efficiently the duties which Shaiixh Abdulla Salim has taken upon himself. He has been frequently absent from Kuwait because of his visits to Faileka Island where he spent the entire month of Ramadhan. He kept rather indifferent health because of a stone hh in the bladder, the removal of which by an operation is precluded by excessive fat. (o1 Shaikh Ahdulla al Mubarak, G .I. 3., continued to ciUDervlse the Department of Public Security with unabajited eri g-.. iiy security In Kuwait and the hinterland has remained Rxcpfient He spent the month of Ramadhan In Baghdad, The Finance Department paid him Rs 3,89,000/- during the year to clear his accumulated debts. (d) Shaikh Abdulla al Jablr, C .I .E., remained Chief Tnatife and Director of Education In which posts he dis charged his duties loyally and efficiently. He has not heen^keeplnp ffood health and went to Baghdad for 3 weeks in September and October for treatment of his hereditary disorder. He was invested on the 29th June with the Companionship of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian ■ffmnl re bv the Hon * ble Lt • vO-i.. tV • , v • T • -Li. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The investiture was held in the Political Agency and was attended by His Kl-hness members of the Ruling Family, some members of the 1. .j 1of the European Community, and many of the leading merchants, (e) ShaiKh Abdulla al Ahmed remained in charge of the Arsenal. (f) Shaikh Subah as Salim remained Chief of Police He went to the Levant to escape the rigours of Ramadhan^ (g) Shaikh Mubarak al Hamad al Mubarak remained Chief of the Port of Kuwait. (h) ShaiKh Mohammed a l Ah med continued to live in Basra and to manage His Highness 1 properties in Iraq* (i) Shaikh Fahad as Salim who is a member of the Advisory Council remained ostensibly un-employed during the period under review. He was, however, seen almost daily in the Itevenue Department. (j) Shaikh Dueij as'Salman al Harnood married one of the daughters of His Highness on the ISth April. III THE POLITICAL AGENT 1 3 R5LATI0NS ./ITH THE SHAIrJI. There occurred nothing to mar the Political Agents relations with the Shaikh which remained cordial. His Highness and his subjects very much resented the restrict ions placed by the Iraqi Administration on the issue of Iraqi visas to Kuwaitis, and he felt that the British Embassy in Baghdad should be able to bring sufficient pressure on the Iraqi Administration to induc^ them to relax the rules in favour of Kuwaitis. Anoth/sore pointy has been the unending litigation with the Iraqi authoritie over the Date Gardens, which has been dealt with under paragraph VII. IV LOCAL IMTERSSTS . (a) General . As a result of persistant pressure the Revenue Department has produced a statement purporting to be a budget for the year 1365 (6th December, 1945 to 24th November, 1946). The salient points gleaned from it are thab the income of the Department for the year was Rs 19 48,333 out of which 22$ was appropriated by the As- Subah as their salaries and those of their domestic establishments. Ihcome from Customs which should be 4% of the value of imports amounted to Rs 13,37,792/6/- y The Shaikh has continued to direct the^foreign affairs of the State singlehanded and to preside over the Municipality. The Consultative Assembly which had almost atrophied was resuscitated xn September, 1946 and ohe following members were nominated.to it:- Shaikh Abdulla as Salim, C.I.E. (President) Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir, C.I.E. Shaikh Abdulla al Mubarak, C.I.E. Shaikh Fahad as Salim. Yusuf Alghanim Yusuf Abdullatif al Hamad. Yusuf Saleh Humaidhi. Khalid as Zaid.^ Nusf Yusuf an Nu^f. Abdul Hamid as Sana. Yusuf Adsani. 'Ahmed Abdulkarim Abul. It is notable for the fact that the Shaikh'sShaikh's following has been considerably strengthened by the inclusion of Shaikhs Abdulla al Mubarak and Abdulla al Jabir, The first meeting was held on the 21st September and was attended by His Highness. It is likely that this Assembly will go the same way as the one it replaced, (b) MEDICAL . (i) The Kuwait G-overnment Medical Department remained under the supervision of the Syrian Dr. Yahya^ Hadidi and of Dr. 'Fadhil, an Egyptian. The latters 1 wife who is a lady doctor is also working with the Kuwait Governj&amp;nent. Work on the new hospital has been^ resumed on a restricted scale due to the scarcity of building material and it is hoped that the building will be ready by the end of 1947. (ii) Over 62,000 men and 32,000 women were treated as out-patients and 547 men and 227 women as in-patients in the American Mission Hospital. 975 operations of all sorts were performed. During the year Dr. Sc Mrs. L.R. Scudder were transferred to Amarah and Rev. &amp; Mrs. DeJong left for America on furlough. However, Dr. Maurice Heusinkveld and wife have arrived and Dr. Mary Allison has returned to take charge of the womens 1 hospital. Plans have been laid to build a new mens' hospital at a cost of 34 lacs to take 60 patients, (iii) 23,525 patients were treated in the Agency Charitable Dispensary, the most common diseases being of the eye and skin. This total represents a very consider able tKsxsass advance on previous years, chiefly due to the increased supply of drugs which it has been possible to secure. (iv) There was no epidemic and the health of the town remained generally good. ^Incidence of tubercolosis remained high and many of the victims were sent to Sanitoria in the Lebanon and Syria. (c) EDUCATION. Dr. Sadiq Hamdi held the post of Director of 'ducation up to the end of September, 1946 when he was replaced by^another Egyptian, Taha Sufi. The change was made by the Egyptian Education authorities without reference to Kuwait as a result of complaints laid against Hamdi by his Egyptian subordinates. There are now 5 boys* and 2 girls * schools in the town with an attendance roll of 1651 and 534 respectively. Of the 70 male teachers 13 are Egyptian and 57 are Kuwaiti, and of the 19 female teachers 7 are Egyptian, 4 Syrian, 3 Iebanese and 5 Kuwaitis. There are a further 7 boys' schools with 300 pupils outside the town of Kuwait. Early in the year the Education Department Drought out a Monthly* newspaper called 'AL-TALIB'. The newspaper, which is edited by 5 students and is printed in Baghdad, deals mainly with educational matters and local news. / t During the year the Kuwait Government continued to maintain the hostel in Cairo where 57 Kuwaiti students reside.- 6) 1 !• (d) POST AND TSLEG-RAPHS. (i) The Indian Postal Administration continued to run the Post Office throughout the year. Theland telegraph line to Basra has worked satisfactorily &amp; although there were occasional breakdowns resulting in considerable inconvenience to the Kuwait Oil Company and to the mercant ile community. The Director of Posts and Telegraphs,^ Sind * and Baluchistan Circle, Karachi has authorised the Sub- Postmaster, Kuwait to accept and transmit messages written in Arabic. It has not been possible to do so for lack of trained personnel. The Post Office continued to operate a twice- weekly mail service in each direction between Basra and Kuwait. (ii) Messrs. Gable and Wireless have ^continued to operate their wireless telegraph station efficiently. The automatic telephone system installed by Gable and tireless only serves 100 subscribers. There are 135 applications for new connections pending with the Cable and ./ireless and an expansion to 300 phones is planned. (e) MUNICIPALITY . The af^irs of the Municipality were directed personally by^His Highness. Its activities are mostly confined to a weekly meeting and routine registration work. (f) haj . The pilgrim traffic through Kuwait was very small on account of the continued ban by the Saudi Government on the entry of persons into their territory who were not in possession of regular travel papers and money to pay the oilprim tax of Saudi Hials 520 . About 700 people, mostly Kuwaitis of Persian origin, left for the Haj during the vear. 300 Kuwaitis performed the journey on camel-back and the charges va^fried from Rs 400/ to 500/- per head for hire of camel exclusive of food. 400 liajis went by motor transport paying Ha 1,000/- for a fronjf seat in a lorry or Rs 800/- for a back seat. A seat in a saloon car cost us £ 000/-. These charges were inclusive of tax, water and tenta^e. Durin^ the months of August and September Indian destitutes, mostly Sindtiis, started arriving in Kuwait on their way to Mecca. They came by foot and occasionally bv boat from Makran, mostly via Gwadur, Muscat, the Trucial Coast and ^atar, but some follo¥;ed the South Persian Coast. None of these had any means of subsistence and were in rags. In October they tried to proceed from Kuwait to Mecca on foot but were twice turned back by Ibn 3aud T s frontier o-na-rds A batch of 18 sent a telegram to Ibn Saud stating tint they had come on foot all the way from India, and not oniv obtained permission but had a lorry sent for them by t be kin^ and the customary tax remitted. The destitutes rm :beriS- 55 adults and 2 children were maintained here, and repatriated at the expense of the Government of India. (g ] PICAHLJ. « The pearling season, which was split into two halves nn account of Ramadhan, resulted in a good yield. ^About 130 dhows took part. The following were the ruling prices rs 5°°/- to p ' s ,V e l o ^ 0w Shirin Rs ^ «n/ ' ft Na'im • • riS if,' 0 'Jl'T ff , T Golwa 10^' to 1! 15^- ' ' Badla 10 &gt; ' to hs 15 / z(h)(h) BOAT-BUILDING. i1 he continued scarcity of wood, particularly teak, did not permit of any large-scale boat-building. However, 10 dhows with an aggregate tonnage of 500 were completed during the year under review, (i) Safar,- u * Due to the infrequency of the steamer service ocean going dhows continued to prosper and earned handsome freights. 98 dhows laden with miscellaneous cargo returned from India and 139 dhows left for India and African ports at the open ing of the season, most of them carrying a cargo of dates from Iraq, The average income of a sailor according to ship-owners was approximately Rs 500/- or double last year*5 average. ( i ) ATTTI-LOOUST 0PSR/VTIQNS . Early in March hoppers appeared in immense numbers in the area south of Kuwait and to a lesser extent to the north. The Middle-East Anti-Locust Unit provided a detachment which was based at Kuwait to undertake operations. The infestations became very heavy in April and hoppers even invaded the town itself. The invasion was successfully countered by the use of poison bait and gammexane and the detachment finally left on the 25th May. Shaikh Abdulla al Mubarak took a prominent part in the operations. Go-opera tion from all Kuwaitis was excellent and exceeded all the locust officer * s experience elsewhere in Arabia. The Kuwait 011 Company rendered invaluable assistance. The invasion was the largest in living memory and immense damage might have been done. As it was damage was confined to the village of Fantas and very few locusts flew. V. DE3EHT INTEHBSTS . Exceptionally good winter and spring rain in the Kuwait desert during the winter and spring of 1946 did much to ameliorate the condition of the bedouin but also attracted many more tribesmen than usual from other areas of the peninsular. Besides the resident t Awazim and Rashaida Kuwait was harbouring in phe spring and summer large numbers of A J man, Ivluntafiq, Mutair, Beni Harb, beni Khalid, beni Hajir, and even Murra. As was not surprising not a few incidents occurred between rival tribesmen and between tribesmen and the Shaikh's bedouin guards. Pease was, however, restored with ease by Shaikh Abdulla Mubarak and his stalwarts owing to the superiority of the motor-car over the camel. During the summer an epidemic (described as 'like consumption ,, ) ^broke out amongst camels and destroyed between half and three-quarters of the herds. This has caused : reat distress to the desert-dwellers. YI FOREIGN INTSHE3TS. (a) SAUDI ARABIA. Relations with the Saudi Government have remained cordial during the period under review. There has been considerable movement of general merchandise from Kuwait to Riyadh. (b) IRAQ, . yvo Relations with Iraq underwent -a change and the irkrirksome visa regulations have remained unaltered. This has caused quite an amount of resentment, especially since the Kuwait G-overnment has placed no obstacles in the way of Iraqis visiting Kuwait, On a number of occasions the Iraqi frontier patrol cars drove well inside Kuwait territory with the ostensible purpose of preventing smuggling^contraband goods• These incursions were naturally resented by the Shaikh, yu date gardens , (a) iTAC a Almost the entire date-crop was taken by the tenants without surrendering his share to the Shaikh in consequence of the sudden cancellation during the harvest by a Basra Judge of the orders of attachment passed by him the previous year. His Highness protested against this and the matter has been taken up with the British Embassy at Baghdad. (b) ^ BA.^SEIYAH . /the Iraq Government auctioned the 180 shares lost by His Highness in litigation and the Shaikh purchased them through Syed Hamid al Naqeeb, an Iraq subject, for 1,0, 8399.404/-. The Shaikh's two lawyers, Sulaiman Faidhi and Jamil Sadiq, resigned their appointment with effect from the 15th December, 1946 as a protest at the perversions of justice inflicted upon the Shaikh which they found them selves powerless to combat, VJII COST OB 1 LIVING. The end of hostilities did not bring in^its wake the anticipated drop in the general price level which remained high right through the year. The daily wages of an unskilled labourer inclusive of food are approximately ps 7/- per day and a skilled worker^ e.g. a carpenter, can command as high a wage as Ks S5/- per day. i?he sale of tea, sugar and cloth at controlled rates prevented much hardship. A comparative statement of the prices of main commodities is attached as Appendix rt A' f . ix. royal navy , H.M,S, 'Wren' visited Kuwait on the 15th Decembere x. royal air force . The Royal Air Force withdrew their detachment from Kuwait during the year. / xi. KUWAIT' OIL COMPANY . At the .beginning of the year, the Company was en^a'ed on the work of installing pipelines, erecting tanks, and commissioning wells drilled prior to recommencement of operations. In April, four submarine pipelines were launchec at Fahaheel and connected to the flow lines from four gravity tanks constructed at Ahmadi. In June, the pumping o' oil from the gathering centre constructed at Burgan to tanks at Ahmadi was begun and on the 30th June, after His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait a had ceremonially opened a valve at Fahaheel, a tanker began to load the first cargo 'of crude oil to be exported from Kuwait. The 30th of June mflrked the completion of the effort put out by the Company between the middle of 1945 and that date, but constructionbut construction continued and tanks were completed which had not been ready for commissioning by the 30th June. From July to December further water lines were laid and houses constructed, while production continued to increase and exports of oil rose. Up to Slst Decsmber 7,68,000 tons of oil have been exported from Kuwait. December was a record month - 1,70,000 tons were exported in 16 tankers. In December a start was made on further survey work for the extention of operations round Ahmadi by the construction of quarters for all grades of staff. Houses were also in course of construction in Shuwaikh for the senior staff and tankage has been installed there for bulk products for the Company T s use. At the end of the year, the Company's personnel strength amounted to:- Senior Staff 73 Junior Staff 144 Foreign Artisans 218 Labour 1193 apart from contract labour. All THE IMFERIaL 3AMi OF IR^N . The two most important features of the bank's working during 1946 was (1) A continued increase in deposits of approximately 70 lacs, which is an indication of the continued, confidence the bank enjoys in the bazaar, and (2) a very large increase in the number of credits opened with places abroad. Previous to 1946 merchants did not avail'themselves of these facilities to any great extent. The withdrawal of rupee notes of Rs 500/- denomina tion and over in the early part of the year gave rise to a little uneasiness, but when a large consignment of lower denomination notes were received by the Political Agent this disappeared. Notes of Rs 1,000/- denomination are still being presented from time to time and these are sent to the Reserve Bank of India, Bombay, where, in most cases they are paid after the necessary formalities have been completed^ 'Money conditions have been easy during the period under review and the bank were very seldom asked for credit facilities. Merchants have imported almost any king of consumer goods that they were able to obtain and have usually disposed of these at large profits. The chief supplying countries were the iJnited Kingciom and tlie L .o.A. Towards the end of the year large consignments of Ion tea were imported from India,/Java and China. Since the ■ing of the price control in America and the resultant rise in prices irters from America experience some difficulty in obtaining goods as exoorters - were unable to sel-i. at the contract price* ihis is^borne out by the continued requests the bank received to increase the amounts of the original credits. No bad debts were incurred by the .^ank during the year. The bad debt incurred in 1945 of Rs 25,000/- has been reduced to approximately Rs 16,000/- Mr* Matheson, late manager of the Kuwait branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran arrived here from Tehran on the 28th 1 February and left on the 9th March. During his stay in Kuwait he concluded an agreement with the Ruler for an extension of the ^ank's concession for a further 15 years and also for the construction of new premises in the town. i XIIIa Ull VISITORS. a considerable number of service personnel end others visited Kuwait during the year. Accommodation was usually provided at the Agency since the Royal Air Force rest.house has closed down. XIV. METEOROLOGICAL .

J ^f)) Major i ti ca1 Agent, Kuwai t M.B.^9 tux .1': -3- 3. AL KHALIFAH. His Highness Shaikh Salman continued to take a keen^interest in the administration of the State. He continued his urging of the Bahrain petroleum Company to extract more oil, and also expressed anxiety that the pearling industry had not recovered the ground lost during the war, Ee is anxious to raise the standard of secondary education in Bahrain, and to this end has asked for the services of a British Director of Education and a British Headmaster for the Manama Secondary School. In February His Highness personally inspected the site where the new customs sheds are to be erected, and visited the power house in April to start the new 206 ICW generating set which had arrived at the end of last year. He wants visitors to carry away a good impression of Bahrain. When he met Lord Pethick Lawrence on the latter's return from India in June he expatiated at some length on the good government and general prosperity that were to be found in Bahrain. Shaikh Mohammed bin isa al Khalifah, senior uncle of His Highness, paid his usual visits to Egypt during the year, the last one being June-September. Shaikh Abdullah bin isa al Khalifah, C.I.E., went on a number of shooting trips during the year. He visited the mainland on two of these trips. In February Shaikh Salman bin Mohammed bin Isa arrived from Jerusalem where he had been studying law He was appointed a magistrate of the Bahrain court in April. A son of His Highness and a son of Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed were among those persons operated on by Sir Henry Holland when he visited Bahrain in November. 4. EDUCATION . (i) Number of schools in existence on 1.1.*46 15 Number of schools in existence on 31.12.*46 lo Number of students on 1.1.'46 2,736 ■^1 Number of students on 31.12.»46 Number of teachers on 1.1.'46 Number of teachers on 31.12.'46 3,178 137 156 f 1 (ii) Ho ys 1 Schools . All the schools were filled to capacity during /the year....-4- the year, and at the beginning of the term several hundred were refused admission as there was neither accommodation nor enough dKKtiax teachers. Demand for education is growing, especially in the towns, and the few private schools which exist are also full. In the Government schools the standard of educa tion is good and compares favourably with that of schools in Egypt, Syria and f Iraq. A new secondary school building was built in Manama, and the old secondary school building was made part of the hostel. At the beginning of the term 19 Egyptian teachers, selected by the British council in Cairo, were added to the teaching staff. The twenty Bahrain students studying in Cairo were brought back to Bahrain because of the political conditions and because they showed little progress. Three of the best of them were later sent at Government expense to the American University at Beirut, and some of the others were also sent there by their parents. •Those who did not continue their education abroad found posts in Bahrain. An attempt was made by the British council to provide a Director of Education, but nothing came of this effort and Mr. Ahmed Omran continued to officiate in this, capacity. He visited England under the auspices of the British council during the summer and was shown as much as possible of English schools and places of educational interest. (iii) GIRLS' SCHOOLS . No new girls' schools were opened in 1946, and many students were refused admission owing to lack of accommodation, staff and equipment. A special needle work teacher was appointed for each school, and a special needlework mistress appointed to superintend the work in all the schools. Eighteen students took their school leaving certi ficates. (iv) TECHNICAL SCHOOL . A section for motor repairing and electric welding was opened this year, and there was an increase in the number of students in consequence. The school also pro vides classes in carpentry, fitting, blacksmith's work, and turning. Several local teachers were enlisted. 5. AGRICULTURE . Two large plots of land adjoining the Manama Municipal garden were brought under cultivation, and at Jidda island more land was cultivated and irrigated from the new artesian well which was sunk at the end of 1945. The amount of land under cultivation is steadily increasing as landlords find that they can obtain good /prices-5- prices for lucerne, dates, and vegetables. 6. MUNICIPALITIES . No public work of major importance was carried out this year,the work of the Municipalities being restricted as in 1945 to town cleaning, the widening and re-surfacing of roads, and co-operating with the Food Control Department in the rationing of foodstuffs. 7. PUBLIC WORKS . Six rooms and several garages were added to the Manama Palace. Four houses for married teachers were constructed at the eastern end of the Manama primary School playing ground. A new European private ward was added to the State Hospital and an additional private ward built on the ground floor. The creek on the western side of the customs pier has been filled^pand a beginning made with laying the foundations of the new Customs Sheds. The old import shed which is situated in the market is to be dismantled and the site used for shops. As an experimental measure a stretch of metalled road was constructed from Manama to the Municipal boundary to overcome the excessive moisture which is the cause of many road accidents. The Bahrain Government have contracted with Messrs. Holloway Brothers for the installation of a town water supply in Manama. Water will be distributed through a ring-main round Manama feeding a sub-main with extensions to private consumers, public wash-houses, and street hydrants. The pumping plant, consisting of three sets of pumps and storage tanks, will be located in the Municipal Garden where there is a good supply of water. Two new artesian wells are being sunk in the garden. The scheme provides for the erection of a pump house and water storage tanks, and the laying of over 16 miles of asbestos cement piping. It will cost approximately £64,000 and it is estimated will take at least 18 months to complete. 8. ELECTRICITY DEPARTMENT . (i) New Installations . The installation of the new 206 KW generating set which arrived at the end of 1945 was completed in April. The Shaikh officially set it working. It operated at 90^ of its capacity for long periods throughout the year. It has been run on an open circuit owing to the difficulty in obtaining equipment for a closed circuit cooling system, resulting in a daily distilled water consumption of 1,400 gallons instead of the 90 gallons that would be used in a closed circuit. As this water had to be brought by road- tanker from jufair it added considerably to generating costs. (ii) Extension to the power Supply . During the year connection was given to a new B.O.A.C. 100 KW sub- station, new stores and machine tool workshops, /the.......■ i sv / -6. the new wing of the Manama Palace, residential quarters for employees of the Bahrain Government, residential quarters for employees of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., 4 new flour mills, and about 116 private consumers. An increased demand by petroleum concessions Limited for the air conditioning for their staff and office premises was also met. (iii) Ne w Agreement with the H.A.F . In May the Bahrain Government concluded a new electricity agreement with the Air Ministry under which they became responsible for the supply of electricity in an emergency to the Royal Air Force at Muharraq, and regularly to the various B.O.A.G. installations in Manama. (iv) At the invitation of the Amir Saud bin Abdulla bin jalawi of Hassa the State Engineer visited Hofuf in March to advise on the electrification of that town, 9. TEL E PHONE DEPARTMENT . No progress has been made with the scheme for an automatic telephone system and the Bahrain public have had to suffer for another year from the accumulated defects of the obsolete equipment still in use. Messrs. Cable and Wireless experienced some difficulty in acquiring suitable sites in Manama and Muharraq for the main and satellite exchanges, but were assisted by this Agency in obtaining the sites required. In September, however, the company informed the Bahrain Government that an automatic system could not be installed and offered a new magneto system instead. Shaikh Salman felt that he had been let down by the Company and replied that unless the Company were prepared to carry out their original proposal, he would invite another firm to undertake installation. The question was still under consideration by the London Office of Messrs. Gable &amp; Wireless at the end of the year. 10. PEARLING . Detailed reports have not yet been received, but prices remained at a high level and the value of the catch was greater than that of last year. Divers, nakhudas, and pearl merchants had a good season, but owing to^ the unsettled state of the Indian market many of the pearls obtained were still unpurchased at the end of the year. There were fewer boats In*commission largely because the absence of timber restricts the building of new craft, and many old boats are now unsafe. New divers are still coming forward from^among the sons of old divers, but many have been educated at the various schools and no longer make diving their, trade. 11. CUSTOMS . Customs revenue from all sources, amounted to Rs. 28.83,410 an increase of Rs.2,8!5,312 over the previous ye&amp; '' There were 116 launches registered with the customs on the 31st December, 1946. 12. FOOD CONTROL . nesoite the cessation of hostilities there was no apparent improvement in the food position during the /yearyear under review, and the Bahrain Government had again to spend a large sum of money, Rs.10,600,000 in purchasing essential foodstuffs. The monthly cereal ration was maintained at last year's level, varying in composition, however, according to the stocks in hand. More rice was available than in 1945 because the Government was able to obtain supplies of Persian rice at regular intervals. The cloth rationing system was successfully maintained and cloth was issued to the villagers twice in the year and to the towns of Manama and Muharraq five times in the year. (The reason for this differentiation is not known). There is, however, an extreme shortage of white longcloth and whijre mulls for summer wear. During the second half of the period under review consumer goods began to arrive from the united Kingdorn^in increasing quantities. It is hoped to relax price control on as many articles as possible in 1947. It has already been removed from luxury articles. The re-export from Bahrain of more goods was allowed to encourage trade. Black-market operators were active but several of the racketeers were fined and imprisoned. This has had a deterrent effect and one result has been that many more people have applied for ration cards. There was still no sign of any downward trend in prices in 1946. 13. SHIPPING . The following is a statement of ships that called during the year 1946:- British 256 American 199 Norwegian 40 Dutch 25 panamerican 20 Swedish 10 Danish 7 Italian 6 Canadian 3 566 The total imports for the year amounted to 51,825 tons and exports to 192,375 tons of which 184,908 tons were petroleum coke. 14. AGCJnRNTS WITHIN POR T LIMITS. On the 9th February, 1946, a foreign dhow bound for the port of Doha with a cargo of 400 gallas Ox dates and 12 tins of date Juice sank north of Muharraq. All the cargo was lost and the craft became a wreck. On the same day a Persian vessel was wrecked at Sayeh near Fasht al Adham. The cargo was lost but the crew was saved. /On the 29thOn the 29th October, 1946, a local country craft with 400 bags of cement from the B.I.S.N. Company's ship 'Vasna' capsized, and was wrecked opposite the customs pier at Manama. The cargo was later recovered. On the 2nd November, 1946, a local country craft with a cargo of 350 bags of cement was sunk near Chas Chose shoal. The cargo was lost but the craft was salvaged and repaired. 15. THE PORT OF BAHRAIN . (i) Extension of R.E. System . Early this year it was suggested to the Bahrain Government that Bahrain might be made a free port. It was thought that the Aden bonded warehouse system could be applied to Bahrain, but on further examination of the Aden regulations it was found that before the system could be introduced a considerable revision of import and export duties would be necessary. It was decided instead to extend facilities under the existing R.E. system. As soon as the new customs sheds have been completed the R.E. period is to be increased from 20 to 90 days, and the system extended to all Gulf ports. (ii) Survey of Manama Anchorage . Masters of vessels calling at Bahrain have long considered it unsafe to use the inner anchorage at Manama if they drew more than 22 feet. In December, however, the S.S. 'Saminver' arrived from Canada with 9,000 tons of wheat and though drawing 27 feet came right into the anchorage. Her master reported that for the length of the course he had never less than 32 feet under him and had ample water at his anchorage. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie thereupon raised the question of a further survey of the Manama anchorage. The Bahrain Government expressed their willingness to contribute to»vards the expenses of a survey. (iii) Loading and Unloading Arrangements . During the year the Bahrain General Merchants' Association expressed their dissatisfaction with the loading and unloading arrangements of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie. They complained that cargo was badly stowed and roughly handled,' and that no discrimination was made between the different kinds of cargo. The Company have taken notice of this complaint and have instructed their stevedores to exercise more care. At the same time they poin-ed ? iustly enough, that the Manama pier did not possess the modern equipment necessary for off-loading cargo. Tnere was only one hand crane, a slow and antique piece of mechanism. The Bahrain Government confirmed that they had asked for quotations for a new crane but that no firm offer had been received by them. New landing craft and equipment are badly needed and Messrs. Gray Mackenzie have taken up the matter with their Bombay Oxfice. (iv) Lighting; &amp; Buoying . L T. 'Nearchus'' made her usual visits of inspection /duringSrf3 -10- '■ ,7 1,129 and 406 last year. A separate report has been sent to the political Resident. a ui is 79? (ii) Local courts . A number of changes in procedure were introduced at the end of 1945 and this made for a big reduction in the number of pending cases and a general speeding up in the work of the courts. There were many criminal and profiteering cases in the first half of the year, but they decreased noticeably in the latter half. 18. POLICE. Strength on Strength on 1.1.'46 , 31.12.'46 . British 7 6 Indians 4 4 Arabs 384 291 Followers 30 24 Clerks 7 9 432 334 NATURS. Manama 31 39 Muharraq 42 41 Outposts 28 31 Jufair -- ^ R.A.F. J36 J36 137 153 Many policemen left the force during the year on the termination of their period of agreement. Rates of pay were slightly raised and a messing allowance was granted in lieu of rations* Many naturs also resigned or were discharged, and their places were filled by temporary appointments. Men who would otherwise have ioined the state forces were attracted by the higher wages paid to labour and preferred short term employment to a four year period of enlistment. An effort was made to enlist a dozen young men of sood families for training as police officer cadets. Over 30 candidates offered themselves but only five proved suitable, the majority of them failing to pass the medical test. The houses of a number of Indian residents of Manama were burgled during the early part of the year, but apart from this public security was good. Smuggling decreased, and there was a drop in black-market activities after several cases had been brought before the courts. Five persons were killed in traffic accidents and 17 seriously injured. 19. ECONOMIC . (i) Trade . Imports increased and there was a large and steady demand from the public for all classes of goods, particularly piecegoods. Difficulty was experienced by /importers.... a-11- importers because of the lack of shipping space, and this forced the banks to extend credit to importers. The greater part of^this trade was with the United Kingdom and covered a variety of articles including piecegoods, hard ware, radios, cement, toilet articles, electrical fittings, toy, shoes, biscuits, etc., etc. Australian imports took second place and consisted mainly of foodstuffs. During the year a small number of young Bahrainis went to the United Kingdom to make contacts with commercial firms. There was also a resumption of business with continental Europe, and in the last few months of the year credits were opened by local banks with France, Holland and Italy. (ii) Banking Exchange . Apart from Indian funds, exchange rates were steady and remained so throughout the year. The Indian market depends greatly on the sale of pearls, and as the pearl market was dull the sale of Indian bills fluctuated from 3% discount in January to 1% discount in December. There was a large demand for foreign exchange. Considerable quantities of uncurrent silver rupees and other silver coins were shipped to India. Local stocks of uncurrent coins appear to be exhausted. Sovereigns were exported to ! lraq and Egypt. The Eastern Bank continued to have by far the largest share in banking activities but the imperial Bank of Persia also had a satisfactory year, in the latter bank over a hundred new accounts were opened. (ill) industry . The difficulty in obtaining cotton yarn from India during the year binder review seriously affected the local cotton weaving industry which is carried on in the villages on the south-west coast of Bahrain. During the latter part of the year Mr. Hussain Agar, a Persian business man and the owner of a cotton mill in Bushire, visited Bahrain with the object of start ing a cotton mill on the island. After some discussion with the Bahrain Government he broke off negotiations and left Bahrain. (iv) property . Land and house values remained at a high level. In September the Government brought into force a new Rent Regulation and as a result values were stabilized and there was no increase in the price of house property. The appli cation of this regulation to shop rents is under considera tion. 20. MEDICAL . (i) General . The health of the community is reported to have improved during the year under review, due, in large part, to a mild summer, and to the increasing sanitary and anti malarial— &gt; ■' 6 i . , aotfij,;;; j 31 cllfi r9 i siinqo 3^ '12- maiarial measures carried out by the Bahrain Government. There still are,however, some 80,000 out-patients treated every year. This number is' alarmingly high. There were no major epidemics, and there was a marked decrease in malaria, only 6,5% of the population in Manama being affected. There was a small outbreak of small-pox in the early part of the year but it was quickly controlled. A Public Health and Welfare Committee composed of the doctors of the three Manama hospitals, and the Secre taries of the Manama and Muharraq Municipalities has been set up, and has already done good work in tightening up sanitary measures and improving the medical facilities available to the public. Sir Henry Holland, K.C.I.E., of the C.M.S., Quetta, visited Bahrain during the latter part of the year. He performed 35 eye operations and saw 150 patients. (ii) Victoria Memorial Hospital . Dr. M.L.A. Steele held charge throughout the year Number of out-patients treated 14,626 ' « in-patients treated 27 minor operations 750 Malaria. Total number of patients treated was 2,683 as compared with 3,806 cases for 1945. Venereal Disease .

This experiment has shown promising results. /MEN.....-13- MEN. Out-patients treated 32,396 In-patients treated 1,961 Major operations 518 Minor operations. 2,981 WOMEN AND CHILDREN .

The Royal Air Force wards in the Bahrain Government Hospital were handed back to the Bahrain Government on the 15th of January, and all patients and R.A.F. equipment in those wards were removed to the R.A.F. Sick Quarters at Muharraq. (v) QUARANTINE . Dr. M.L.A. Steele was in charge as Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. Shipping. No change was made in the quarantine arrangements for Manama, but all vessels calling at Sitra now inform the Quarantine Medical Officer direct by radio telegram of their last port of call and whether they have any infectious disease on board. The system is working well and messages from vessels intending to call at Sitra are received regularly. 566 vessels called at Bahrain as against 394 which called in 1945.

THE BAHRAIN PETR OLEU M COMPANY . (a) General Management s Mr. Ward P. Anderson was General Manager and chief Local Representative of the Company at the beginning of the year. In March he left for the United States to take up a post in the New York office of the company, and was succeeded as General Manager and Chief Local Representative by Mr. Russell M. Brown. Mr. W.R. Pinckard, President of the Bahrain Petroleum company, visited Bahrain in April, and Mr. Don J. Hanna, a Vice-President of the company in October and November. (b) production and Development . Total oil produced during the year was 8,009,802 net barrels, an average of 21,945 net barrels daily. Production rate was increased during the year as additional wells and gas injection facilities were completed. The extra facilities provided resulted in the ability to control the influx of extraneous water into the reservoir thus per mitting a higher rate of withdrawal. By the end of the year under review the production capacity of the field had increased to 25,000 net barrels a day. The facilities commenced last year to permit the direct loading and unload ing of ocean-going ships at Sitra were completed and brought into operation. (c) Producing Field . Field Development work was resumed and seven new wells were completed during the year. The drilling of these wells was part of a programme undertaken to (i) replace wells captured by the expanding gas and advancing edge water thus assuring the fields ability to sustain current production rates; (ii) re-distribute withdrawal from the reservoir to assure maximum economic recovery; (iii) increase rate and improve distribution of injected gas; and (iv) permit further observation of the effects of production practice on the reservoir. A number of wells were awaiting major repairs before they could be returned to production, but the repairs were held in abeyance to permit a more rapid advance in the current development programme of sinking new wells. (d) Tmports of Arabian America n crude Oil The oipe line from Saudi Arabia operated satis factorily throughout the year. The total import o. Arabian American crude into Bahrain during the year amounted tou) mo!tw -15- 25,881,285 net barrels as against a total of 15,649,272 o2o oot 5, f i ? lire f,or this year, given above, includes net Darrels of crude delivered by tanker through the Sitra Marine Terminal. (e) Exploration Work . Exploration work within the Additional Area was resumed towards the end of the year and the drilling of one structure hole has been completed. At the end of the year preparations were under way for the drilling of additional structure holes from specially constructed drilling piers in the open waters of the Gulf. (f) Refining Operations . Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput and crude runs during the year totaled 33,989,452 barrels, the year were as follows: Shipments of products during Aviation Gasoline Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Oil Fuel Oil 417,842 Barrels. 7,940,605 ' 4,088,907 ' - ^ r 7«,022 ' —~ rf t ±,uoo, 907 6,478,022 12,309,322 31,234,698 Barrel« i- ' i In addition to the above shipments 118,275 tons of coke produced in the previous year ! s operations were also shipped. Very little aviation gasoline was produced during the year as the demand for it had dropped with the end of the war. Except for one short run the facilities for manu facturing this product remained closed down, but the balance of the refining facilities continued operating at capacity. (g) Refinery . No major operating facilities were completed during 1946. There were, however, alterations and additions made to several existing plants. (h) Sitra and 3itra Terminal . The construction of the causeway and the new wharf started in 1945 were completed during the year. Many other facilities, such as a magneto telephone system, a new pump shelter, etc., were provided in the sitra Terminal.^ Work was also commenced on an extending tank field lighting system. (i) Drum Plant . No major alterations were made to the Drum plant but minor additions were carried out to increase drum manufacture and filling operations. (j) namp facilities . increased numbers of personnel have necessitated increased housing in Awali. The 20 two-bedroom houses . /started-16- o ^ ^ in 1945 have been completed and 13 additional ?! f 00 ? ar e in the course of construction. The increased number of families also necessitated a 2-room extension to the Awali school. The 52 room bunkhouse no longer required for living quarters is being converted into a native hospital. (k) Personnel. The following gives a summary of the personnel employed by the Company on their regular operations and on additional construction work during the years- Americans British (U.K.) Canadians South Africans Other Europeans British Indians Iraqis Bahreinis Others Total 120 (Including 18 Con- trac tors 1 employees) 348 60 24 11 554 8 3,170 641 4,936 22. PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED . (i) This year the company were able to resume geological exploration and drilling in their various concessionary areas in the Persian Gulf. A geophysical survey party visited the Trucial Coast in the spring and again in the autumn of 1946. Arrangements had been made for a seismic survey party to visit Qatar in the autumn but the U.S.A. seamen 1 s strikes delayed the party, and they are now expected to begin work early in 1947• (ii) QATAR . In April, 1946, Dukhan Camp was re-opened and pre parations made for a drilling programme to be started in the autumn. This plan was abandoned in October and it was decided instead to xjap speed up production, and toMi January, 1949, was fixed as a provisional date for the first export, preliminary general surveys were carried out in November along the projected route of a pipe-line and pipe line road and locations for a terminal oil dock site, a permanent camp, and unloading points for heavy equipment were examined. It has been proposed to build a road from a new harbour near Al Hamlah on the west coast of Qatar across the peninsula to a jetty at Wakrah, with forks to Doha and a terminal oil dock in the vicinity of El Arrif. More will be known of the practicability of these proposals when H.M.S. 'Challenger' has completed her survey of Qatar territorial waters which she began in November of this year. (iii) TRITGIAL COAST. in the first part of the year surface geology was carried out in the following areasi- /Jabal-17- Jabal Faiyah Kalba Jabal Hafit Baraimi Oasis Part of the Oman Range to the east of Bara^Lmi and Hafit. In the autumn an extensive programme including magnetometer, gravimeter, and topographical surveys was started in the undermentioned areas: Ras al Khaimah Umm al Qaiwain Ajman Sharjah Dubai Abu Dhabi. Close contact was maintained throughout these operations with the Residency Agent who was of great assistance. 23. GABLE &amp; WIRELESS LIMITED . (i) TRAFFIC . All classes of traffic increased and comparative figures of paid messages for 1945 and 1946 show an increase of approximately 14^. A feature has been the steady increase in traffic in Arabic characters between the various Gulf Sta-es and Saudi Arabia. 1945 . 1946 . Despatched from Bahrain 31,272 36,535 Received for Bahrain 23,494 29,299 In transit 51,555* 55,461* ♦(These figures do not include traffic in transit for 'Iraq and Persia). Aircraft services were maintained on a 24 hour a day basis throughout the year, and the marine short wave service which had been suspended during the war was re- introduced. The marine medium wave service was curtailed from 24 to 16 hours a day after Admiralty control had ceased on January 1st, 1946. (ii) GABLES . The Bahrain-Fao, Bahrain-Bushire and Bahrain-Muscat cables were interrrupted for long periods during the but all were in working order on the 31st December, 1946. The wireless services to Kuwait, Hassa, and Sharjah were Tn«inf-ained throughout the year, and a radio-telephony 5?Wnlt onened with the Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, ™ nnkhan in Qatar. There was a total disruption of communications witil Bushire from the 19th September to the 11th November during the tribal disturbances. (ill) TKCHNICAIi . The Transmitter Hall has been extended to accommodate in irnowatt transmitter (now being Installed) and other equipment which may be required in future. Three additional /modern receivers-18- modern receivers and a modern cathode-ray equipment for servicing all Persian Gulf wireless equipment has also been installed during the year. (iv) STAFF . -'ft 0 rise in traffic and the return to a pre-war looting has resulted in an increase in staff from 41 persons in 1945 to 54 persons in 1946. g.4?-BH _ITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION . During the year the corporation completed its return to a peace time footing. The special R.A.F. services were abolished and some of the B.O.A«C. services discontinued. The trunk route service from the united Kingdom to the Far East was extended to include Singapore and was operated by Sunderlands. The weekly Lockheed Lodestar service between Bahrain and Cairo which was proposed at the end of last year was not introduced. Early in January the 'Ensign' class aircraft were with drawn from the Cairo-Karachi schedule and their place taken by 'C' Class flyingboats. Towards the end of the year notice was received that the 'C' Class flyingboats were also to be withdrawn and replaced by the new Tudor land aircraft. Unfortunately the tonnage of the Tudor 'planes makes it impossible for them to use the Muharraq aerodrome and this will deprive Bahrain of both the Durban-Calcutta and the Cairo-Karachi schedules and break the air link with the Trucial Coast. A short table of statistics for 1946 is given below. Fewer passengers embarked and disembarked at Bahrain than in 1945 but there was an increase in the amount of freight and mail carried. With the discontinua tion of U.S.A. Post office facilities the mail of British and American employees of the Bahrain petroleum Company was again despatched by B.O.A.C. aircraft.

(ii) A considerable reduction was made in all ranks of the Royal Air Force personnel in Bahrain during the year. The use of the R.A.F. ward in the Bahrain Government Hospital was therefore discontinued, and R.A.F. sick are now treated at Muharraq. (iii) With the discontinuation of the 'Ensign* class 1 planes no land aircraft were used on B.O.A.C. schedules and they withdrew their personnel from Muharraq aerodrome. The R.A.F. have, therefore, become responsible for the application of the Bahrain Air Navigation Regulations to all civil aircraft alighting at Muharraq. (iv) At the end of the year the R.A.F. Assyrian Levies both at Muharraq and sharjah were withdrawn and replaced by locally recruited naturs, or watchmen. 27. AMERICAN CONSULATE* DHAHRAN . Mr. Parker T. Hart held charge of the United States consulate at Dhahran for the greater part of the year being relieved of his charge in November by Mr. Waldo E. Bailey, the present incumbent. Relations between the consulate and this Agency have continued to be friendly. At the request of Mr. Bailey the political Agent arranged an interview for him with the Shaikh. The consulate has been at some pains to boost America and American business both in Bahrain and the /Trucial coast......-20- Trucial Coast by the distribution of well got-up literature.

About 60 tons of wireless masts and other wireless equipment from the U.S.A.T.C. establishment a Sharjah were sold to the Arabian American Oil Company by the U.S. Army authorities and shipped to Dhahran by oil barge. (xil) Local Affairs . (a) In April of this year the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah built a fort at Wadi al Qaur to prevent highway- robbers from invading the Batinah Coast through the Wadi al Qaur. The Muscat Government met the cost of building the fort and are also paying for the maintenance of the garrison consisting of eight men. (b) After the Khor Ghanadhah incident relations between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi became strained. When all the efforts of the political Agent to induce the Shaikh of Dubai to return some 150 camels, which he had looted, to Abu Dhabi failed sanctions were imposed on him by stopping all travel facilities to Dubai subjects and by diverting one steamer to Sharjah. In the meanwhile the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had raised a force of 2,000 men under the command of his brother Shaikh Hazza bin Sultan for invading Dubai. The political Agent who was then at Sharjah prevented a clash by obtaining the agreement of Dubai to pay compensation to Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh of Dubai also agreed to return all the Abu Dhabi looted camels. Although these demands were complied with, negotiations for the restoration of friendly relations between Shaikh Hazza and the Shaikh of Dubai broke down, and the efforts of the various Trucial Shaikhs to mediate in the dispute were all in vain. Both sides indulged in numerous camel looting'incidents the shaikh of Dubai taking the initiative in most cases. By the end of the year the situation had quietened down. (c) Another significant event on the Trucial Coast during the year was the dispute between the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and his brother and his nephews. In August the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah garrisoned his fort and strategic points in and around Ras al Khaimah stoppingno ?' * '■ '•' ■ 0 i sau sttt o?.; ■ to mo ^ j «■ ' s^noaiii , ■nelgl ^ 1(7 a-t ill (ixi ip ^p9 389ln w 0^3 p; «d ■ .9§i£d ;;■' ll [ill] ') iud risii, ioiI | (I ♦u mf. j'lol .■ ; ioo fi^hi' sii'j m''. | f.j ufi | ' to / o;i f i : ' | ^illqqo; c ' ^ 7o /ti' ' i ptiibfc'-'' :i &gt;i; so); ■ ; 9iq m' l: bij oi b^yts •' -28- all traffic to and from the town. He also prevented his brother Shaikh Mohammed bin Salim and his nephews who were staying in the gardens on the outskirts from entering the town. His reason for taking these pre cautions was the alleged plotting by his nephews to kill him and seize power. All persuasion failed to shake the Shaikh from his firm resolve to refuse his brother and nephews entry into the town. He, however, was prepared to give them the usual allowances. Shaikh Mohammed sought the intervention of His Majesty's Government in the dispute, but both sides were informed that they should settle the matter themselves. By the end of the year no progress had been made. (d) Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Na'im at Buraimi, blinded and then executed three persons suspected of having organised a plot to assassinate him and instal his cousin Humaid bin Hamdan in his place. The Shaikh is a wealthy man and very unpopular among his people. H.B*M.* s Political Agent, Bahrain.

The public health measures in the town of Muscat remained satisfactory throughout the year and the President of the Municipal Council, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, is now endeavour ing to clean up the town of Mutrah. He has approached the Political Agent for his assistance. rb) Ap-encv Hospital . The Hospital was open throughout the year. The supply of drugs for the hospital has been satisfac tory'from the Medical Stores Depot, Bombay. More equipment was ordered from India from the funds collected during the year. The hospital building underwent minor repairs and was whitewashed. Wire, gauze was fixed for the Agency Surgeon's consulting room and more gauWfor O.T. wards etc. is expected. The two small rooms near the European ward have been re-appropriated for a clinical laboratory. The microscope was sent to India for repairs and is expected very soon. The attendance figures of the hospital were as under: (1) New cases (2) Cases re-attended for treatment (3) Total number of cases treated during the year 9510 11566 21076(4-) Average daily attendance 57.7 (5) Total admitted to hospital .. 158 (6) Total number of deaths in the hospital .. 7 (7) Major operations ., Nil (8) Minor operations .. 197 Prevalent diseases during the year were malaria, dysentery, minor septic and skin diseases, eye diseases, malnutrition and veneral diseases. Malaria was prevalent till about April, 194-6, and a marked improvement was noticed after this period. Total number of patients treated during the year was 1137.

Dysen tery broke out about September and is still prevalent. Staff ; The work of the hospital staff has been satisfactory. The Agency Surgeon was absent from Muscat for months in India on leave. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon was officiating in his absence. Quarantine ; No infectious disease required segregation at the quarantine station at Haramil. A few isolated cases of measles and chicken-pox were reported during the year, but. segregation in their own dwelling places was found sufficient.

Weekly health intelligence reports are received from the Special Commissioner, S.E. Asia, but the receipt depends on'mail steamers. Weekly reports from the Muscat Government were not considered necessary, but will be insti tuted if any serious outbreak occurs. III. PQLTTIGAL SITUATION . (*) Tribal. In the beginning of the year, His Highness the Sultan received a letter from Shaikh laa bin Saleh of the Sharqivah alleging that Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni ^Bu AH was intrieuin^ against the Hirth tribes by stirring up dis- sention between those sections of the Jeneba tribes allied with Shaikh Isa and the sections allied to the Beni Bu Ali. His Highnessr - - ---s [I (s| : .'3 h i ■: zlm ^r: ^ -3- His Highness despatched a messenger to Sur to enquire into the position, but later it was learnt that the reports reaching Muscat were all exaggerated and that there was, in fact, no tension between the tribes. Shaikh Isa bin Saleh of the Sharqiyah died at Badiyah in March and Mohammed bin Isa, his son, succeeded him. His Highness the Sultan visited Sur twice during the year and his visits were reported to be successful. In February, news was received from Salalah that the Bait al Mi shard, a small tribe living on the coast, who had for some time been showing some opposition to the V/ali of Dhofar finally capitulated. His Highness the Sultan received an invitation from Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamiyar of the Jebel Akhdhar to send a representative to the Jebel after Ramadhan. Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, half-brother of the Sultan, was despatched in September and his visit to the Jebel was considered very satisfactory. His Highness received a letter from the American Consul at Dhahran requesting him to pass on to Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamiyar of the Jebel Akhdhar a reply to a letter the latter had written and forwarded through Dr. W.W. Thoms of the American Mission Hospital at Mutrah, who v..kited the Jebel as Shaikh Sulaiman 1 s guest. His Highness was somewhat upset that Dr. Thoms should have allowed himselr to act as a medium for correspondence .between one of the Shaikhs of the interior and a foreign official. (b) Local. The President of the Municipal Council, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, requested the assistance of the Political Agent in obtaining the services of a qualified engineer to assist the Municipality in its efforts to improve local amenities and to plan a Municipal Office to be/erected at Mutrah. No one was willing to accept the appointment till the end of the year, but efforts are still being made to secure one from the General Ismail bin Khalil Ar Rassassi, Chief v/ali and the Wali of Mutrah, returned from leave in January with three ea- chers for the Saidieh school from Palestine. Captain Yamkanmardi arrived from India to take up his duties as Medical Officer to His Highness the sultan. Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur married the daughter of Saiyid Nasir bin Hamud al Said of Rustaq in June. Mudhaffar bin Sulaiman, the V /ali of Sohar, died in m cvvar His sudden death at a comparatively youiig S caused^ great s^ise, and appeared to consider that he mlcht have been poisoned by a member o. the local tribes amongst whom he had many enemies. An American subject Mr. Donald W. Hennie, arrived at Muscat in a dhow from India in May after a somewhat adventurous voyage during which he acted as a member of the crew. ■ij i u ' i'A- erew of the vessel.

Owing to the complaints received against him, the head of the Control Department, Saiyid Abdul Barri al Zawawi was removed from his post and Saiyid Hilal bin Mohammed was appointed in his place. At the request of His Highness the Sultan, Mr. T.F. Williamson, Geologist, was sent by the Petroleuxi Concessions Limited to explore the Batinah region and to suggest ways for improving the water facilities in Muscat and Mutrah. He arrived in Muscat in November and after touring the Batinah coast, has submitted to His Highness his report. The report is under consideration.

Agha Jawad Vossuq retained charge of the post of Civil Governor for the remainder of the year. Owing to the outbreak of disturbances during the general strike of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company labourers in July and the necessity for the re-imposition of Martial Law, the Military Governorate was re-opened and Major Fateh, the Garri son Commander, was placed in charge of the post. He held )A charge till early in September, when he was arrested on the orders of the Military Tribunal in Abadan, which was investi gating the causes of the strike, and sent to Tehran on a charge of peculation In respect of a sum of Rials 200,000 paid to him by the Oil Company for the purpose of evacuating 6/700 unemployed men and their families from Abadan. As it happens, he was exonerated from the charge in Tehran and assigned to a higher post. He was succeeded in Abadan by Colonel Jawanshlr, who however fell seriously ill shortly after his arrival and was replaced on 2nd September by Colonel Sarimi, who held charge till the end of the year.

In May it was thought that there would be a danger of wide-spread malaria after the flood waters of the Karun and Shatt-el-Arab had sub sided, and measures were taken by the Health authorities to spray likely breeding areas in Khorramshahr town and in the surrounding country with crude oil. During the same month, advantage was taken by the public of the Minister of Health's presence in Khorramshahr to send in complaints regarding the lack o^roper sanitation aid health measures in the town. The Minister promised his assistance in making suitable improvements and stated that it was the intention of the Government to raise the status of the Quaran tine Department to that of a Department-General for the South ern Ports.

A sympathetic strike was thereupon organised for a few days by other pro-Tudeh teachers and students. l. military, ■/ ■ British Troops. The evacuation of British Forces from these areas com- m menced early in the year and the last units of the Army in this Province withdrew through Khorramshahr on March 1st. In February, there was a minor clash between a company of Persian troops and a mobile patrol unit of the Sikh Light Infantry Regiment, resulting in the death of one Persian civi lian and injuries to six Persian soldiers. The military report on the incident indicated that the clash was caused by the civilian (who was later discovered to be a guard in the evacua ted U.S. Camp) who fired on the Sikh unit in the course of its patrol* An exchange of shots ensued, but erased on the timely arrival of the Sikh Duty Officer, who eventually brought the situation under control. The Karun Pontoon Bridge was dismantled by the British forces before their departure. It was taken over by the Angloflranlan Oil Company and eventually installed across the Bahmanshir River. Iranian Military. Ereent for the period between 11th May and July 13th, Martial Law remained in force throughout the year. At thp end of the year, one Infantry Company from the 14th Ahwaz Infantry Regiment was added to the Military Garrison on Abadan Island, thus bringing ^ total strength to four Infantry Companies and one M.G.

After she had propelled herself down the Shatt-el- Arab in a most erratic manner, it was discovered that she carried no ammunition suitable for her 12-pounder guns, which were of British make^ and she therefore had to return 'to port* It was decided during the year, that salvage operations in respect of the two wrecked vessels - the ''Palang 11 and 'Hu- mai 11 - should be an Admiralty commitment and, at the end of the year, arrangements were made to accommodate the salvage party on arrival. The former Persian Naval Headquarters at Khorramshahr were used as Military Barracks throughout the year. The Per sian Government however have since decided to revive the Per sian Navy and Colonel Zelli was appointed Naval Officer Com manding and arrived in Khorramshahr in December. g^urtfry i On the transfer of responsibility for policing this area from the Allies to the Persians, the state of internal security deteriorated almost immediately. Armed robberies, violent assaults and actw of hooliganism in Abadan and Khorram shahr towns increased in number and audacity, and the Police force proved to be quite Insufficient in numoers and equipment for the task of controlling the situation, which reached its climax during the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company labour strike in July and the subsequent riots, when British and Indian employ ees of the Company were frequently attacked and beaten up on the roads. The imposition of Martial Law and a curfew did little to improve the general security position, which was aggravated by the arrest of the Chief of Police, Abadan, and his deputy. This undesirable state of affairs was also due in some measure to the activities of the Tudeh party, at whose meetings blood-thirsty anti-British speeches and threats against the lives of Englishmen were uttered as an encourage ment to acts of violence and hooliganism. At one period, it was suspected that weapons were actually being turned out by members of the party in the Oil Company's workshops, but surprise raids by the Company's Security Department failed to substantiate this.

The state of security in the Tribal areas remained at a reasonably good level throughout the year. n % politisal el' The most Important political developments in this area during the year were centred round the activities of the Tudeh Party, whose various political manoeuvres were designed, inter to gain administrative control over this and other parts of the country In preparation for the general elections to the Majlis. Early in March a branch of the Tudeh Party held Its first public meeting in Khorramshahr. Its subsequent meetings Increased In number and intensity of feeling, which culminated in the outbreak of the Illegal general strike throughout the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concessional area in July. Though the ostensible reason for the strike was the demand of Friday pay, it was evident that there was no industrial justification for its outbreak whatsoever and that it had been engineered exclusively for political ends, as all the points at issue between the Angloflranian Oil Company management and the labour ers were already under discussion before a Government Commission in Tehran. The Military Tribunal, which arrived from Tehran to enquire into the causes of the strike, was composed of officials with strong Tudeh sympathies and their main object was to exonerate the Party completely and place the responsibility for the disorders on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The/Cfci4i«*len lu^/ took no action to punish the ring-leaders who had been arrested, and actually ordered the release of some of them. When firm representations were made in Tehran against this venemous antl- /fcW / British campaign, the/toBB^^tct turned their attention to the ry' Chief of Police and his Deputy, on whom they cast the responsi bility for the whole disorders. It was only during the last quarter of the year that those persons responsible for the riots were rounded up by degrees and removed. The arrival off Abadan during the riots of two of H.M , s Ships and the concentration of British and Indian troops in Basra brought immediate protests from the Persian Government in Tehran and from the Press, but they actuated the former into taking adequate measures to pro - i.her disorders. Tho lannchine. and subsequent activities of the Prime Minister's Democrat ^arty of Iran caused no little anxiety amongst the Tudeh Party members in November Pfl-rtv ooened a branch in Khorramshahr, and though little enthusiasm was shown during its inauguration, its influ- obtain /-3.1} o; «} M1 IfiSVO* il '' Ji, t uj ' 0 5§t snbd s1 . ip^i ■ ^ i *' li edj icfscosbjk - 9 - 011 Government, the arrests of Tudeh i n^ nr lta1: ors. and finally the liberation of Azerbai- ^ U i at . e effec t&gt; Which resulted In the dis- appearanc, of the Party from the local arena* The movement has since gone underground, and secret meetings still continue to be held in private houses. Since writing this report a new Union has come into being which will be called the 'Oil Workers Union . The chief signatory, Yusuf Iftikhari, was prominent in the 1929 riots and he was at one time associated with the Tudeh Party, but fell out with them on discovering that their aims were political rather than Trade Unionism* The other signatories are ex-Tudeh members who say they wish to break away from that Party because they have discovered that the Party funds have been embezzled etc. This new Party will register itself and be of a non-political character* It will also publish its accounts* The workers* immediate reaction to this new organisation is one of suspicion because they fear that it is either sponsored by the Government or the Company* torn i &amp;c of to mm: ♦alllsi iws itoq tall jt teelt jtoo sdi cl 1809^20 5: m ol | fno tH io- llwmw la ww ^ sd'i fnt oikf 5001^3 w f 9^0 . foB on | [ill'lobf t; lo 6ns ^ : | ebl ^ 1 ' djrtqfi ili W &lt;• tt* 9l \ f 0$ ^ ni. tribal With the exception of Shaikh Abdullah bin Khazaal's escapade in January 1946 (an account was included in the Administration Report for 1946) the tribes in this Consular area remained fairly quiet* Timely intervention by H*M # Consul provented the massacre of evdry Iranian in Khorramshahr on the 15th July when the Arabs had come in to avenge the murders of their comrades in Abadan by the Tudeh mob* Had it not been for this intervention, there is reason to suppose that the neighbouring Arab tribes would have also descended on Abadan where still larger massacres would have ensued* A number of attempts were made during the year by the Persian Officials in Khuzistan to regain the confidence of the Arabs. Many leading Shaikhs were invited by the Governor General to call on him at Ahwaz, and the assistance of Jhaikh Chassib bin Khazaal was enlisted in order to persuade them to do so. No amount of persuasion, however, was enough^ to overcome the Arabs 1 inherent distrust of Persian intentions or their suspicion of Chassib, whom they kriev. had agreed to assist the Persian Government in the hope that he would regain the former Kazaal property •- which they held and cultiva ea. Messages were also sent by the Governor-General to those Arabs whn tmnp over to Iraq, assuring them that they would be allowed loreturn to their homes in Khuzistan without inter- ference from the Persian Government, but these messages also went unanswered. When Tudeh hostility towards the Arabs became apparent, H.M. Consul received frequent requests for guidance as to the policy they should adopt and for British assistance in resis tine anv attacks made on them by this Party. xne poxxcy 01 striet^non -intervention was, however, invariably adhered to. ri^nhpration* the Arabs decided to form a ^ er f n-nntpet themselves against external influences, tribal union to protect tnemsexv^ the naB)e of the Ilct.a' gamer's n y oB'&gt; but it achieved nothing and has since sunk into oblivion.
