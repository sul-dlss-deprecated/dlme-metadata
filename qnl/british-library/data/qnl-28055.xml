In the circumstances described in paragraph 1 of this telegram we agree with sir Header Bullard’s view that there is a good case for the payment of Lieutenant Pedersen’s salary during his secondment from United Kingdom and Indian funds. The India Office are awaiting the views of the Government of India, but meanwhile we shall be grateful if we taight have Treasury sanction for payment of half of Lieutenant Pedersen’s emoluments from United Kingdom fun os.[ISn clair]. ^ J ' a GO D^PaRTM^wTaL NQ« 1 FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE K Sir R. Bullard No. 50 Saving 22nd September, 1944. D. 22nd September, 1944. R. 4.10 p.m. 28th September, 1944. Repeated to Government of India No. 77 Saving (Copy to Paiforce). ///// Dr. Millspaugh requested Paiforce last April to permit, the secondment of Lieutenant P.C. Pedersen, I.E., to investigate the finances and administration of the Government-owned factories. Paiforce consulted this Embassy who stated that in their view this officer would do useful work in the proposed employment. Paiforce thereupon lent him and he has been working under Dr. Millspaugh since then and doing valuable work. Paiforce then enquired on what terms the Persian Government proposed to employ him but Dr. Millspaugh informed us that for political reasons he did not feel able to ask the Persian Government to pay Lieutenant Pedersen and he urged that this officer should be lent on terms similar to the Cereals Liaison Officers or to the officers lent to the Road Transport Administration. The former are paid jointly by the Foreign Office and Government of India, while the latter are paid by f Paiforce. Paiforce have refused to pay Lieutenant Pedersen s salary during his secondment and the only alternative left, appears to be to pay him on the analogy of the Cereals Liaison Officers. I submit that there is a good case for this. Incompetence and corruption in the Government factories seriously affects Persian finances and we are as anxious to rehabilitate these as we are that Persia should raise sufficient cereals to feed herself. Again, the.more efficient these factories are, the less goods the Allies have to import.into Persia from overseas. I trust therefore that the Foreign Office and the Government of India will agree to defray Lieutenant Pedersen's pay, allowances and any non-effective benefits during his period of secondment. 2. Dr. Millspaugh has undertaken to broach the subject of Lieutenant Pedersen's employment by the Persian Government as soon as it is politically possible. 3. Grateful for telegraphic reply after consultation with the Government of India.
