The political A^ent , Bahrain' MEMG RaNI) UM_. , 1 am directed to forward a petition dated 21st Safar from Shaikh Khalifah bin Hamad .al-Khalifah of Bahrain with the remark that no doubt petitioner w as present when Colonel Knox addressed the members of the ^l-Khalifah family in open Majlis , warning Shaikh Khaliiah, as he warned others , that it was only too likely that something of this &amp;ort would happen- The method which Shaikh Khalifah adopted to secure the redress of his prievances was calculated to procure exactly-the result which has come about. The olitical Resident does not admit the right of. any member of the ^l-Khalifah to be sup orted out of the revenues of Bahrain . It is a matter of p-race , and their allowances will depend almost, entirely on the amount of- service they be expected to render and actually render to the Bahrain Government, now represented by Shaikh Hamad assisted by Shaikh Abdullah. Qnless you see any objection ^petit ioner might also be informed x.hat no one objects to petitioner's going out into the world to earn his livlihood wherearer he may find it , always provided that his efforts to gain a livlihood do not take the form of intriguing against the Bahrain State or vexing Government offi- 0 ^^ 8 with futile complaints against the Bahrain authorities . 4/ Capt.

Yea , since he tocx over chAari*# ot the agency it Bahrain he has b c en ruining by thia policy more than build ing and retrograding iLore than advancing. The first action of the PoXitical Agent vas the di&amp;ibi»4ial ol the Kunioi^aiity secretary on the ground that he had robbed trosi the Municip ality. When the Deputy Ruler ol Bahrain wrote a memoran- cun on 3th dhawwal to him asking execution of the man aa an example for others he w £ annoyed and attacked the writer ol the BieBaoranduS. ^ince that time 1 understood thai he wae not adopting a reguxax policy but was serving nie personal objects. ?hen we *&amp;m that he w**» giving appiicaticn^ ol thanks and confidence to some rabble? who were threatening the people to sign them. I was assured that he wae not conlident of his actions, otherwise geed acts do not require any evidence. Alter a short while he killed one ol the Baatokkis by beating hiiL at the Consulate, accusing him of a robbery ol a ring and when the Egyptian school master argued on this savage action he took an opportunity anl repatriated him. Since three months ago a man-of-war by the order ol the Political ^gent wes sent, ^aiyid Ai^ad ben Abaoliah jos^ri wflwa arrested , taken to Bahrain and imprisoned there without knowing the reason* He was fined a suoa ol hb 13000/- without any Judgment knowledge (of having caamitted any thing) . He was as*ced to write a letter and apologize for so&amp;e things about which he was he w*« possibly unaware but he refused and preferred to remain in prison rather than admit a thing from which he w^ acquitted . Do these act- 1 n^ correspond with the justice of Britain and are such proceedings attractive to the minds of AOie ^rabs ? But ths great timls&amp;mm&amp;toff calamity which has no e^ual•niual is the presentation ot a paper to JrAiKh Laa ben ^li at th^ ©rvJ ot Raiaaaaii asking hlr«4 to abcHo^te fro i the Chlei- aiiip of Bahr ain and aubtraot .iis ether dues f but all the tribes of B^hr^in are supporting him In the matter of ab dication and Bubtracteawi on of any of his rights.

To The Foreign secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, jeihi• Sir , 1 have the honour to aotoowledge receipt of your letter No. liC5-PoO. dated l^th Hov^iaber fo^ardiiig a petition from Munammad bin Wbdulla al Khalifa complaining % about the present at te of affairs in Bahrain. The writer of this petition is tne son of Siiaikh Abdul la, the youngest of the three sons of ^naikh Isa. 1 had neard that MunaJnmad bin ^.bdulla ^ad been to Kuwait and had sent off petiticna from there in every direction, both in his own name and Shaikh Isa's. as described in page 4 of my letter No. 622-i3 dated 10th November 1923 1 traced Shaikh Abdulla with his aon^ intrigues and implied that 1 thought Shaikh Abdulla had a hand in them. He denied this,but 1 feel sure Muhammad could not have done such a tning without his father*s approval or at least nis conniv ance , And in the end it was arranged , as stated in th* above meiitioned letter, that S *iaikh Abdulla should make Muhammad apologize to Shaikh Hamad and fine him and that the fine »;iould be paid into the Banrain Government Trea sury. 1 trust tnis action will check Muhammad's intrigues . Muhammad himself is 1 believe ^rather a) foolish but2 but not thoroughly bad young nan. He had recently tali«a into bad ooatpany and haa baan lad aatray by tnalx advica t notably by tha rascally xugyptian Muila Haflz who haa ton 9u the aubjaot ol oorras .ondanoa with tha government ot India. It may not be out ot plaoe wo manticn hare th^t MulXa HaTis , on tha pretext ot oolleoting debta , w a permitted to return to B^hrrin for a limited jmuoh L time. Be#ore that time was up however Uulla hafiz begjin to ma^e l-lmaeir a nuisance and the political ^ent w a tninkixig 'mmm ot advising him to retiurn to Kuwait, when the tellow suddenly dashed off to Riyadh to «»ee Bin JauU with whom he haa been in communicat ion. Doubtleea he will continue his anti-Fritleh propa ganda in Hejd -*nd do us a good #eal of harm there. as for the statements of i&amp;uiiau&amp;mad 1 e petition tney are merely a rechauffee of all the lying suatement&amp; waich have been spread abroad by Haji Abdul Nabi Kazerun of Bar&gt;-&gt; rain and his small following of malcontent Persians . Tne Government of India have heard of nearly all the charges ad nauseam and it is not necessary for me to worry them by refuting all these unsubstantiated allegations. a etition which w s presented to me by a deputat ion of representative Bahamah just before 1 left B^hr iin on 7th November in, l/think, a sulficient answer. W# are now insisting on reforms to ameliorate tne lot of the down^- trodden inhabitsJits of Bahrain, and Judging from this pet ition are doing it with some suceess. Naturally the oppressors,to wit tne siuniii tribes in general and tiie a !

I have very carefully thought over Shaikh Hamad's suggestion that I should write to Khalifeh but 1 am inclined to think that to do so would be using a sledge hammer to crack a nut .

It you could do anything to help us in the matter by instructions to the ollicers serving under you 1 sia*ll be most grateful. Bahrain, as you no doubt know, and the Political Agent points out in his memorandum, is cursed with a number of idle younpfc Shaikhlings who have nothing whatever to do and whose useful employment is one of the mcst difiioult problems that we have to deal with in those islands . II you could go a little further and convey a 'little word' to His Majesty King Faisal, that would be even more effective . 1 do not suppose that we are ever linely to send State Visitors irom Bahrain to Iraj but if we do, you and His Majesty may rest assured that they will travel with proper credentials and letters of introduction.

The seateace had the desired effect at the time,it frighteaed A1 Khalifeh &amp; quieted the outraged Bahraaaeh. Ibrahim was the prime *mover ia the secoad outrage &amp; it is proposed to igaore his letter for the time beiag &amp; doubtless aow that he has had a rebuff ia Najd &amp; the Dowasir are makiag it ua- comfortable he will sooa be ia a better frame of miad,especially whea he learas that his brothers are ia receipt of pecuaiary assistaace.

Although it was clearly established at the trial that selauaa bia Khalid came from the maialaad to his house &amp; iaduced him to Joia him, it is aow fairly clear that Selmaa bia Khalid desceaded oa him uaawares &amp; got him to assist him through misrepreseatatioas,leadiag him to believe that it was act iateaded to do more thaa r^id &amp; steal from the Baharaaeh.

SHKIKH HAHAP BIH MOHOMBS AL CT^ItAH PBOM BAHRHSf♦ Sir* I have the honour to report that on the night of the 27tij/28th August 1925 Sheikh Haaad hin tfohamed A1 Khali fan forcibly coramandeered a jollyhoat belonging o s one Shi ah villagers of JASARAH on the Norths we rtirn coast of the main island, and left Bahrein territory with 4 followers for an unknown destination* This clandestine departure was made without Sheikh Hamad* s permission and attended by the following circumstances: • About a fortnight before Sheikh Hamad's return from Burope, a Shi ah tenant of a date garden situated near the residence of Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed at JA6ARAH brought three donkeys to the police station in Uanama, which he alleged were the property of Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed and had been discovered by him ( the tenant ) in his garden damaging the trees* The matter was reported to the Bahrein Court, which sent a suraraons to Sheikh HamaiJ J- bin Mohomed, requesting him either to appear in Court him^t or to appoint a Vakil for the case* The fidawi returned with a report that Sheikh Hamad had refused to sign the summons■ VS) •ummone. and had declared in a rage that ha would never attend the Bahrein Court himself 9 or appoint a Yakil. The case was of course proceeded with in the ahaence of the defendant* the damage aaaeaeod and two of the donkeys sold to pay it and their own upkeep in the police station • The third donkey was sent back to Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamad, but as he refused to take it, it was finally sold and the proceeds credited to i Goyemment* A letter was at the same time sent to Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed by Sheikh Mohamad bin Hashid ( Judicial represent* native during Sheikh Hamad* s absence in Europe ) abating that the Court was unable to OTerlook his action in this case, but thr*t the matter was being postponed until Sheikh Hamad's return* Owing to Sheikh Hamad*s constant occupation in other and more pressing affairs* the matter was not taken up serious- &lt;*ly until about a week ago* Sheikh Hamad told me ( as X had known before ) that in this affair Sheikh Hamad bin Hohamed had merely acted upto his character and reputation for truculenoe* rudeness and insubordination which were too well known to Polity Agents in the past to need further description* It was decided that Sheikh Hamad should send a letter to Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed requesting him to appear in Court personally on the 29th August to explain his conduct, that the letter should be despatched on the 28th August and that on the day previous Sheikh Abdullah and Sheikh Salman should visit hiatf prepare him for what was coming, and explain that he was required to do nothing more than all other members of the Al Khalifah had bean doing for the last two years vis* to attend the Bahrein Court when called upon to do so* The only result of the visit was an intemperately worded letter to Sheikh Hamad on the 27th August followed by the departure described above on the same night, before Sheikh Hamad*s letter sunraming■umaonlng him to the Court wao despatched • Sheikh Haiaad is conrinoed that Sheikh Hamad Mn Mo homed is suffering from a touch of insanity - The circum- «stances of the present case certainly seem to confirm this diognosis - Sheikh Hamad bin Mohomed has left his house with numerous women* children* serrants and animals all unprorided for* disloyalty and disobedience* Sheikh Hamad has decided that froperty of Sheikh Hamad bin Mohomed shall lie confiscated to the Bahrein QoTemment* a ppears to hare inherited some of his fathers insanity &lt;• His grandson however Mohomed bin Khalifah bin Hamad is a young boy of quite a different stamp « He has written a letter to Sheikh Hamad disclaiming all sympathy with his father and grandfather and expressing loyalty to Sheikh Hamad* The latter proposes to leave him in charge of his grandfathers house and to give him a small allowance out of State funds* bin Mohomed may make his way to Persia to join his son at Tehran* Sheikh Hamad does not want either of them back again in Bahrein except on terms of absolute submission* He would feel very displeased if Sheikh Hamad bin Uohomed went to Bin Saud but this is hardly likely* as the latter ^ould be almost sure to hare nothing to do with him* Regarding this behaviour as an act of wilful His eldest son Khalifah bin Hamad* now in Tehran In the meanwhile it is possible that Sheikh Hamal X have the honour to be, Siirr , Your most obedient servant* Political Agent* Bahrein*Ay/r/V/ COKFIS^TTIAL .

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter -To. 75/5/18, dated the 31st August 1925, regarding the sudden departure of Shaikh Hamad bin Mohomed A1 Khalifah from Bahrain, and to state that the Hon'ble the Political Resident deprecates any confiscation at all of Shaikh Hamad's property over such a somewhat trifling affair, especially in view of the doubts that prevail as to his sanity. 2.

Pleaae refer to Horner 1 a nomorandum I'o .318-3 dated the 4th September 19^5 on the subject of the auddtn depart- -ure of 3heikli Hamad bin ...oharu-iad from Jiaurain, Vy letter ITo.75 /5 /18 dated the Slat August 19^5 was mnftv6tdably (owing to lack of time) confined to a uescript- ion of the circumstancea attending iheikh Hamad's departure and tl^e immediate cauaea of it. To understand fully the motives which promx)ted him to take auch a deciaive and ij._- adviaed step it is necesaary to look back 55 k ears in tht . iiiatorj of Bani-ain! Ir; the eara 1368 and I86fc the foliow- -ing tvents occurred (videpa^-es 395-399 Vol.I Historical Parti, Gazetteer Persian Gulf):- Sheikii ] ohammed, the present 3heikh i-amad's father, after a rule of 25 years in Bahrain, fled, at the approach of a British fleet, to v . w atar, and his brother Sheikh ^li (father of Sheikh Isa) was declared Sheikh of Bahrain uy t-.e British authorities in his ot^ad. After less tiian a year's ruxe, Sheikh Ali was himself defeated and killed b w his brother Sheikh Mohammad in an engagement on Baiirain island. A second British fleet then visited the island, captured 3heikh Mohammed and installed Sheikh Isa, son of iiheikh All, as Sheikh of Bahrain, which he has remained ever since. Sheikh Hamad bin Kohamiyiad is tiie eldest son of his father, and of a wild and headstrong temperament. He has never submitted to Gheikh Isa's rule, more ti^an once openly declaring f tue latter a usurper and himself the rightful 3heikh of . ahrain. iie has naturally treated Jheikh Hamad bin laa 's assiimx^tion of authority witii stili mere disdain, and has persistentxy refused to reco^ni^e that t^e The Ilon'ole Lieut, Colonel C.G.Crosthwaite J.B.iu., Political esident in the Persian Gulf. / / rII. latter has anv judicial powers over uim. It was only under a threat of tht most serious consequences tiuxt iie was induced to attend the hearing of a case in which he w ^s concerned about a year ago. I trust tixat it will be clear from the above that the refusal uf Sheikh Hamad bin liohammad to si^n a sumnona from the Court in Lhe present case was not the reau.it of any fit of an^er at the seizure of his animals, but merely a further example of the refractory and contumacious attitude he has persistently adopted in the past. It was impossible there-fore for JheiKh Hamad bin Isa to disregard it. Kot wishing however to precipitate matters too much by the despatch without previous warning of a letter caxiing upon him to attend the Court, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa arranged for his brother -heikh -uDduilah and his son Sheikh Salman to visit the old man and endeav- -our to prepare him for what was coming. Although the unfortunate result was to a large extent due to his own perversity, I strongly suspect Sheikh Abdu .lah of de-uiberate^ frightening him and suggesting to him that he should jieave Bahrain and join his son in Tehran, i-vbduj-lah had been very friendly and hei'pful since his return from iiurope, but this incident, I think, shews that he is as unstable and as unreliable as ever. The departure of Sheikh Hamad bin JLohammad is not likely, I think, to revive an v old dissensions among the A1 Khalifeh as he was intensely unpox)iilar with all factions equally, but some capital is bouna to be maae out of the incident by those lesser members of the ^1 Khalifeh (foremost among whom is -heikh Abdullah's son Mohammad) who make it their business to carry on a desultory intrigue with Persia. In regard to the confiscation of Sheikh Hamad's property, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa will no doubt be ready in deference to your wishes to convert the order to one of attachment by the Court pending some settlement of the111. case. The latter course at least appears neces -arv, as tht State i.as been compelj-ed to taii© over ti.e managament of iiis estate and the care of his wives, children, animais etc., aj.l of v/hich have t&gt;cen left without proper provision. I sun afraid this j.etter has reached a very inordinate xeugth, but I trust you will for ive its short- -comings. Yours Jincerel,, ,% ir: CONFIDENT IAL. D . 0. No. 342-S. The Residency, Bushire, 19th September 1925. Oolonel CroBthwaite desires me to reply to your D.C. letter lo. 82/5/18, dated the 13th September 1925, and to say that he wishes you to suggest to Shaikh Hamad that the property of the absconder (Shaikh Hamad bin i^uhammad; should be administered on the latter's behalf, if his grand- -son i -uhammad bin Khalifa is not yet old enough to manage the esoa^e, and that all revenue should be collected and held xor him a^ter suitable allcwiinces have been given. confiscatory measures are advisable and he thinks that they should be carefully avoided.

Acoording to his conversation with sone of his well wishers and lovers of country, he is expecting a ^ood treatment fron the Persian Government, After his ten days stay at Bushire his nephew Shaikh Ibrahim Al-Khalifah with all his grievances joined him at Bushire, Prom the statement made by him, the British Consul at Bahrain has 'taken an extremely severtstepa against him and imposed heavy punishment in the form that he(BriMktish Consul) has attached and collected all the wealth, horses and cattle belonp;inr to the Shaikh and has kept in his own possession. Some of the valuable things have been put on action. Cash and a valuable pearls have been misappropriated by the Consul to his own pocket. The things that he has been unable to misappropriate for his personal use are detailed as underj- 50 Arabian horses of higher value than Rs,1000/- each, 60 Bahrain Donkeys J^o Do Rs, 500 A each. The Shaikh has not been lds.8t disturbed by these agressions as he has true love for his country (Persia), which love he has proved many times before this. Leaving aside these things robbed of him if all the wealth and souls of the world, may fall in the hands of the British, I cannot leave or shirk to love Persia whioh is the country of my ancestors. To the last moment I will sacrifice my own life and the lives of my — children for Persia and against the enemy of my religion.

It ..ill be re collected that when first sentenced he waa sont to India where he for 3one time lived in great confort at the expense of Shaii iianad &amp;.ter vhen the scale of his expenditure vae cist down, he left India lb went to Kuwait &amp; later to ^ atar. Shaik rlaiaad had him arrested when ne returned here t 'brought oefor his court. He decided to rescind' the original ore r for banishcient but sentenced hin to six months imprisonjent for brcaicin^ the previous order of the court with-jut perTiiisyion &amp; further passed an order to the effect that on release frorc jrison he ahould reside ± in Llc -uiameh or *uharraq ^ not be permitted to visit Pafa* or bitrah the scenes of his crine, I thinic perhaps this is the b ^et solution that c -&gt;uid be made of a difficuJ.t position. Although, the punishmsnt of ai^ month imprlsoilment for a particularly dastardly murder caanot be coii^ia- ered adequate from our point of vie.', the fact that a neribtr of A1 Khalifeh can be sent to prison at all is co rcvoi .-l tionar: that it cannot fail to have much moral effect on tadly be],a. ed members of the t amily . The shaile is a little Inclined to r pent for his hardihood in the matter Is to attempt to suggest all sorts of mitigation of prison routine which would make the i-prison ent a complete farce,but it is to be hoped that Mr Belgrave will b^ able to i:eep him up to the mark &amp; persuad him of the injustice of prelerential treatment for a particular prisoner* The. concessionlias already been mad® th.a't. tine prisoner oiiould not be tivkcn ou'tside the Fort v^here he would. b« seen hy tht public,nor is he placed v/ith. other criminals in jail. This however is not unreaaonable und(5r the circumstancoo existing in Ba rain, I trust that the ^-on^le the Resident v/ill approve of the SahiJ^s action in this case. It is believed that his brother Ibrahim who w^s sentenced to death in the second Sitrah trial, is contemplating coming back &amp; has been trying to strike a bargain before doing so,In accordance with your previous instructions the Shaik has sent him - v - messages to the effect that he must make unconditional surrender lb . throw himself on the mercy of Government. Should he eventually return I think perhaps some action similar to that no?; taken with his brt .ipr 14.1 ,might be possible? At the time of the trials no punis^n^nt of imprisonment could be inflicted in Bahrain,since t-cre was no jail &amp; no Levy Force to look after prisoners.That is now changed u a short terms of imprisoniMnt is probably the most effective check that can be given to crimes by A1 Khalifeh.The latter are notoriously cowardly k it is only their complete immunity from punishment in the past that induce gave them sufficient courage to wutimxatjpt their retainers to murder women &amp; children of the Baharaneh.If this immunity be relieved such crimes are not likely te be repeated.

I^astonished at the inforration reported to you. When I violted you on ry arrival I inforrred Your Excellency of all things that happened and do,^repeat here what I have said before. I did not take an Ilr-C-Khabar frotr the Lingah Authorities, not even a word, neither I have given rroney as passport fees or in any way depostited with Hajj^i ttuharrad Bahzad^or narve asked hiir to stand suret. for re. As I have already explained to your Excellency, I landed in the usual old way in Lingah. On the next day of xry arrival at Lingah the Director of Cuotors sent ve a rresdage saying that he wanted to see our certificates of identity and will have their returned to rre after he rade the necessary endorserent on their. On the next day i.e. the day I was leaving Lingah for hawking, I sent for the certificates of identity, when he (Director) replied that lie was giving the satre to Hajji Vuharrad Eahzad or one of ry Arab friends at Lingah. iSo I wrote froir out side and fc.ekdd hiTr(Vuharrad Bahzad) to take the certf Certificates of identity fror the Director of the Custors and have their sent to ire. When he demanded the certificates of identity the reply was,that he(Director) wanted Krs 120 as Passports fees far entering and leaving Persia and will then liave the certificates handed over to him.In reply Hajjc ¥uhaTrirad told hiir, that froir the date we used to go there we never used to pay anything and as this was a new thing he waa leaving the ratter for re to decide, Hajji Vuhanrad then wrote to Tre(I will show you his reply)in suport of wiiltrl have said) and inforred of this.2 ^ : - e conve rdation that took place between us wlien I waa returning ,v x£tMxixkMXxx*lxjamt i roo Lingah was the one which I inforir -ed you about, that is ,1 was able to leave Lin^ah without paying any fees or taking a permit. As I told your Excellenc &gt;* at the tire of • rry departure^ I gave Hajji Vuliarrad Rs 200/ as present or in place of the KI3WAH (suit*) for distributioj arong the three officials. This y ter I have salarred Hajji Vuharrrad in the jolly-boat at the tire of leaving,and thus 1 rrai^ged to leave without paying any fees or taking any perrrit. If this was considered as fees or surety I would surely have had to pay it before boarding ; the ship. And when we reached the ship there were two i'ersian officials fror Lingah siHnding at the gang-way. They asked ry servant when I was going up the stearer &gt;3 he was going in Iront.of ire^bout his penrit.

T# The Secretary to the Political Resideat in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir I have the honour to say that some days ago I at last foi found time to go to Sakhir and interview His Excellency Shaikh Hamad regarding the letter written hia hy the late Political Agent regarding offences committed by certain of his relations namely Ibrahia bin Khalid, Hamad bin Abdullah al Ghattaci and Shaikh Hamad bin Subah* 2, No sooner had I mentioned the subject than His -xcellenc started off on a long statemeiit in which ho stated that he personally had never considered the men guilty and had only tai taken action against them because he was pressed to 1© so. Ihen he finally paused for breath I told him that if he really did not consider any of them guilty he was the only person in ^koee Bahrein holding those views and pointed out that on no greater evidence certain men had oeen sentencod in the agency courts to long terms of imprisonment* 3, At this point His Excellency seemed somewhat nervous and shifted agitatedly from buttock to buttock plaiting and unplaiting his feet. I continued discus sing the matter and told him that Shaikh Hamad bin Subah, at any rate ; had himself asked for a trial to cloar himself of the imputation against him, and said that His Excellency did not realise to what ex tent the unwillingness of the Bahrein Government to deal with highly placed criminals was unfavourably commented on. Ho replied that his one wish was to do Justice, v/hereupon I sug gested that if he did not wish to deal with these men himself he might appo^priately send them to the Qadhis.4. At this point the situation entirely changed. His Excel- lencyt ( reflecting perhaps that there would be little evidence aganist the men ) suddenly expanded and said that he wished nothing better than to do perfect justice. He said that jus tice should be perfectly even, neither one scale rasied or the ether depressed. He said that it was not always easy to do it, but that like the British Goyernment and King George he hoped he would always, with God^ help, do justice, no matter what inconvenience it might cause hia. 5. I need not say that I was astonished at hearing these sentiments from His Excellency, but I contented myself with telling him that he was a worthy descendant of Solomon the Wise am 1 that his decision to deal with these men would have an ex cellent effect on the general public in Bahrein, and that it did him great credit. 6. I do net think for a minute that such a prosecution will result in a conviKtien, but the mere fact that a prosecu tion has been launched against the members of the Shaikhly fa mily and th*t they have been called upon to answer for their offences cannot fail to have a deterrent effect en others. e I have only just complted the collection of the evidence, and ^two although there is a good case against the first named I think there is little against the thrid, and he will certainly be acquitted. 7. It may be found better to have the case taken up by to the Bahrein Court and then coan itted kjc the ^adhis, so that it will not be possible for the Bahama to say that the Gov ernment have avoided a proper hearing and not dealt with the matter openly. If possible this will be done, and the Adviser is asking Shaikh Abdullah today if he will sit en the Court for the occasion. 8. I will inform you of any further developments after Iluharram when it if hoped the case will be taken up.t^rnamm Confidential. TTo. 219 C. The Agency, Bahrain. 21 overnber 1930, Dear Colonel -hen you arrive. Shaikh Mthamnad bin Isa, Shaikh Hamad's brother, is going to press you to say that there is no objection to his going hawking *ith some Arab Shaikhlings near Lingah. I told him that I believed the situaion to be un changed, and th; t such a trip might 'be accompanied by even more inconvenience to him that he expexj.enced last time, but he in sisted that I should ask your help in facilitating his trip. I should have thought that his humiliating experience two years ago would have cured him of a desire to return to the Persian littoral, but he explianed to me that it was difficult to describe the passion he feels for hawicing, and even if he has to go from Tebai in a launch to some obscure port, he still wished to go. tive at Lingah now:.days.
