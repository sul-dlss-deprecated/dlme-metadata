I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter of the %3lst. ulh'mo in which you forward a number of documents relating to the red oxide concession on the island of Abu Musa. I am to state that, as these papers have only been subjected to a cursory examination in your Depart ment, some delay must ensue before the draft reply can be properly prepared: it will, however, be submitted for the observations of Mr. Secretary Morley as soon as possible. In the meantime I am to state that, in view of the long interval of time which has elapsed since the Ger man case was forwarded to your Department, Sir E. Grey is strongly of opinion that some temporary arrangement should be decided upon without delay, in order to fur nish The Under Secretary of State, India Office.i ? f ^ furnish Messrs. Woenckhaus with a limited supply of red oxide from Ahu Musa every month to enable this firm to fulfil their contracts. The arrangement would of course be made without prejudice to the final adjudica tion of the case. I am accordingly to suggest, for the consideration of Mr. Morley, that it might be expedient to instruct the Government of India to formulate proposals for such a supply being placed at the disposal of Messrs. Woenck haus without delay. I am further to suggest that the telegram on the subject might advantageously be marked 'Urgent'. I am.

In view of large claim for damages which with continued lapse of time would lie against Government, if Messrs. Wonckhaus’ case should be upheld, Foreign Office press for early decision whether some arrangement might not be made for supplying that firm with a limited amount of red oxide pending settlement of dispute and without prejudice. Please let me receive your observations as early as possible. The point mentioned by the Foreign Office seems a weighty one. Foreign Secret. Abu Musa island. Cox telegraphs, 6th April “ Abu Musa island. R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence ” and German steamer have left for Abu Musa island. Consul for German Government, in communi cation received 1st April, again pressed for estimation of weight of oxide lying inland at mine, but 1 replied my negotiations with Sheikh had enfv governed 2,000 tons odd lying on beach, and could not guarantee safe operations of present steamer if any access to mineral or mine were permitted. Latest news from island is to the effect that amount on beach is nearer o,000 tons than 2,000, and present steamer will not be able to remove it all. Your telegram of 6th April has been communicated to Cox for necessary action, and I am consulting him on suggestion at close of telegram.

Foreign Office y(Confidential.] C695FD fl No. 909 , dated Bush ire, the 21 st (received 30 th) March 1908 . From— MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Pesident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of my letter No. 793, dated 8th March 1908, I have the (3) suggested intention of the German Government to insinuate the Porte into the Abu Musa question. (4) Nature of assurances reported to have been given to Haji Hassan bin Ali Someiyeh by the German Firm. I merely communicate these reports for what they are worth and have no separate corroboration of the information given therein. I may add here that the Agent reported that when the mail left he was just about to leave for Abu Musa simultaneously with the party which Hassan Samaiyeh, who has accepted the conditions prescribed, is sending over to prepare the oxide for shipment. S. S. ff Louise ” has now passed up the Gulf and I expect to hear at any moment from Dr. Listemann the date on which she will probably be at Abu Musa. 2. My Russian Colleague, Monsieur Andre Miller, dining at the Residency a few nights ago inquired after dinner whether he might without indiscretion ask me to tell him what was the present position regarding the Abu Musa dispute with reference to which the papers had such a lot to say. Had it yet been finally disposed of ? In reply I told him briefly what the facts were and added that there had been no grounds for treating it otherwise than as a commercial dispute. The following conversation then followed M, Miller: “ But from what I hear the Germans are making much more of it than that. Is it not the case that they dispute the Sheikh of Shargah’s ownership of Abu Musa Island ? ” Major Cox: “ No. The ownership of the island by the Sheikh of Shargah is not impugned by them. On the contrary, there is no doubt on this point of ownership ; the island has belonged to Shargah for generations.” M. Miller : “ But surely the Persian Government claimed the Island a few years ago and hoisted their flag there ; did they not ? ” Major Cox: “ Yes, an over-zealous Customs Director did so, but you will remember that they had to remove it forthwith, and the Sheikh’s flag was reinstated.” M. Miller: “Did you know that when the Henjam question was in evidence, and was apparently claimed by the Sultan of Maskat, it was intended to have a conference at Tehran for the purpose of allotting the various islands in the Gulf? ” Major Cox : “ I never heard of any intention to have such a conference. As a matter of fact, it was not the case that the Sultan of Maskat (I) No. 66, dated 4th March 1908. honour to forward copies of four reports (a) No. 67, dated 4th March 1908. since received from the Residency Agent, (1) No. 66, dated 4th March 1908.

(1) Mr. Brownaw&amp;s return to Lingah and his proceedings since arrival.C625FD 2 claimed the Island of Henjam, as far as I know. What happened was this; the Oman Arabs by whom the Island is peopled, owing to the Persian Government having attempted to alter the status quo and to levy customs duty from them, addressed an appeal to the Sultan of Maskat, saying that they, Arabs of Oman, had settled in Henjam during the occupation of his forbears and now that tney were being oppressed by the Persians, they considered that they had a claim on his protection, or something to that effect. Soon afterwards the Sultan found himself en route to pay a visit to his friend the Sheikh of Abu Thabi and called at Henjam in order to despatch telegrams to Maskat. The Omani inhabitants naturally took the opportunity of calling on him and repeating their^ grievances. A great deal seems to have been made of the incident, but there was nothing in it, more than I have told you ”. M. Miller': “Oh, I thought the Sultan of Maskat had claimed the Island. Everybody said so.” The foregoing seems of some interest, so I have ventured to report it. No. 66 *'dated 4 th March 1908 .

They are engaged in writing day and night. They are also busy in preparing accounts and making up account books. Hassan and Abdulla are busy (in this work) until midnight and this (their work) is most secret. This information was furnished secretly by a person who is a guest at the house of Hassan bin AlTSomeiyeh ; he also informs me that Hassan and Abdul lah do not allow anyone to visit them (while they work) and that^ whatever they prepare and write at night is delivered to Mr. Brown in the day time.

While 12 years old, Haji Ali was engaged as a servant by a man from Tunis and made a voyage from Tunis to Jeddah. From Jeddah he arrived at J- &lt;in S a with the purpose of proceeding to Basrah.

Abu Musa island. In view of reports circulated by German firm it will create very sea-shore, which is that claimed by Wonckhaus as about 2,000 tons ‘ ready for shipment.’ I hope His Majesty’s Government will see their way to decline to entertain Wonckhaus’ claim to this inland oxide, or failing that, to reply that there are other claims upon it and they will need to be considered quite separately after examination of concessionaires’ books.” His telegram, No. 247, sent before we passed on your telegram of 18th March, ran :— “First. Please see my letter dated 8th instant, No. 775. German Consul now writes that, according to communication received from Berlin, the consent of His Majesty’s Government for the removal of oxide covered all oxide on the island already excavated. He, therefore, asks me to arrange that Sheikh gives similar guarantee for the removal of this oxide also by subsequent steamers, and suggests that amount of this other oxide be esti mated by our representatives when they proceed to Abu Musa Island to weigh the material just about to be re move d. I am informing him in reply that the previous correspondence and my instructions appear to me only to deal with oxide lying on the seashore ‘ ready for shipment,’ and not to any other, but that I am referring his communication to Government, and will communicate again on receiving their further instructions^ I will forward a copy of his letter by to-morrow’s mail. _ In the first place, it does not appear that Wonckhaus has any legitimate claim to this other oxide, and in second, it will take several weeks to bring it to the shore, and its weight cannot satisfactorily be estimated until it is cleaned. _ . “ TIip Rush ire Karsaizar. who is at enmity with txovernor, prejudicial effect if any access whatever to inland oxide is permitted to Hassan or German firm during present visit of ship for removal of oxide on and get to shore for shipment. g) i Off \3 Draft . Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. Sir, O I aid directed by Mr. Secretary copy of a telegram from the Govt, of India, dated the 22nd March 1908, as to a claim for profits in respect of Bunder Abbas by Nejef, the son and heir of Nakhuda Ali, of whom mention was made, as a partner in the concession, in Enclosure 2 of the case submitted by the Gerrnan Go vemment. seems open to question whether, at the present stage of the discussion to instruct the Consul to take up the case; and whether, if such instructions are sent, the German Govt, should not be informed. If the case is taken up, there would seem to be no objection to the the Secy, of State for Foreign Affairs, the Abu Musa concession, entered formally before E.B.M. Consul at Mr. Morley sees no objection to the proposal in itself. But it with the German Govt., it is desirable originals of Enclosures 4 D and 4 E of the German case being called for and to the summoning of Mr. Brown as a witness. &gt; A. QOOLE\ 17 From Viceroy, 22nd March 1908. Foreign Secret. _ Please see Cox’s telegram No. 116, dated the 12th February, repeated in my telegram of 16th February. On 16th February Nejef, son and heir of Nakhuda Ali, partner mentioned in Enclosure 2 of German case, has entered before Consul at Bunder Abbas formal claim for profits of concession. Resident asks if Consul shoidd now take up case. We see no objection, provided Consul is careful to observe correct legal pro cedure. It might be useful to secure account books of Hassan as exhibits in case, since Cox reports that Brown and Hassan are now together at Lingah working at construction of account books. Please see paragraph 2 of Cox’s telegram No. 51, dated 18th February, repeated with our telegram of 21st February. Cox now asks whether Brown should be called upon to produce originals of Enclosures 4 D and 4 E of German case. This might be done by calling him as a witness in the case brought by Nejef Ali.Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Foreign Office letter to the India Office, dated Jan.8,1908,No .78. 5. The purchase in October 1907- long after the Sheikh had terminated the concession granted in 1898- of one share by Messrs. Wonchhaus would appear to establish that Mr. Brown and his followers set sail from Lingah for Abu Musa on October 22nd, not for the purpose of protecting the oxide accumulated on the shore, but in order forcibly to exercise Messrs. Wonckhaus' newly acquired rights as co-owners in the original concession. It is further to be remarked that the sale to Mr. Brown by Hassan Samaiyeh is dated the very day on which the formal notice from the Sheikh of Shargah, directing him to cease work on the island, was served. 6. Sir E. Grey considers that it would be expedient to ascertain the precise wording of enclosures 4 d and 4 e in the note from the German Charge d'Affaires. The former bears the impress of an endorsement rather than of a substantive document.———— H India Office, 31 1'aroh If08. Sir:- With refer mm to t/our letter l f o.?8 of t?w 8th Jmuary 1908, forwarding a etatemnt from the mmm Eru.acwj of the olaime of Keeere* Wonohhaue in reepeot of the omoellation by the SfteiHh of Shargah of the omoeseian for mining oxide of iron on Abu Hum Island, X m directed by Hr. Scoretarj 7? orley to enclose copy of a telegram from Oovemmmt of Ifitlio, expressing ttmir views on t?w representations of the German Qavemrent. It is understood that the reply to the German case mu be prepared by the Foreign Office. The papers referred to in the telsgrm, which have been received by this mail frm the Govemmnt of India, are therefore forwfrded vHthout detailed examination. As regards the general questions of policy involved, Hr. Harley would draw attention to tlw folloHr.g points. (1) She re formes® in the o&amp;mm case to the foot that the Sheikh was at one firm a partner in the lease raise the point whether it night not be held that he was thereby precluded from denying that his mole, Sal in-bin- sultan, who granted the lease ms the mmm* .of t as, and had a legal right to lease then to the original lessee^ and that He**are. Wonckham, into whose hands the Sheikh's share in the lease ultimately passed, are qua their rights as partners tbs assignees of the Sheikh'a shtre. It appears to he established t'nat Sal tm-b in-Sul tan s'Jbmquently to his loss of the Sheikhship in 1883, ims in no sense the o mr of the mines; that, subsequently to i?m 23m under Secret ary of State, Foreign Office. agreemnt1 n:rrmmnt arrived at in imp he lived at Shargari as the Sheikh'* adviser;md in granting lease he me noting zs&gt;'nln ai prowj far tits Sheikh. The right of the Sheikh *o o^-moel Vie lease, in spite that he ms at tns ti,i-i a p ertner in it, is hosed hy the government of ■ partly cn the terns of Pie of SO constituting his partnership, but mainly on the arbitrary r.nfitre of the sovereign potmrs enjoyed by the Sheikh. It is tQ h&lt;&gt; ob90 rv&amp;d that the original oonoesstan oonoludee with tm fiords - »J have perhaps node out oertain agreements 'previous to this. They do not hold good, md this agreement 'is to be noted on'. (%) The arg’nent in the Osman oase Hasson Smatysh had noted mthin his rights as managing partner in contrasting vrtthMessrs. Tonokhaus for the delivery of oxide, and that the terns of the oontraot mre mom both to Abdul Latif,the representative of the Prttish Govern - r/sntj and his eon Hsa, a partner. t n the lease, is ml by the foots stated regarding Abdul Latif's notion tm natter, ana the objection taken hy Ess to Hassm Smatyeh's proceedings. Strictly speaking, the question of managing partner's poiosrs in suoh a ease muld appear to he me to be decided a wording to im». (3) As regards what is said in your letter of the 8th January, as to the difficulty, in of notion taken by H.M.Govermmtin the natter of the Hon-.w oxide contract, of basing an argument the on the ground of the Objections to a monopoly, I m to point out that in Ess's letter to the the oanosllstton of the lease, md Sheikh's to '-imscm'—rcxf.r- Ifmsan Smaiimh of the Blat February 1907 9 t?m 11th Safar md the mth Shafom ism 9 stress is laid on the oh jeon one to a monopoly as a Jmtifioanm of the ommll- ation* it epp&amp;ars to Pr, Marl&amp;y that a distinction am be dr wm be tree m a mmoptobj containing provost ms that safe guard the Sheikh's interests* md one in such general term ■as thorn of the camelled lease. (4) To turn to the question of t?m future working , of the mines* it 'Mil be seen that the Government of India . oonoisr in the suggestion ^tPajor Cox's telegrm of the 10th liar oh that *&amp;s soon as o i rems tones s permit* im shouh Hntrmuoe a trustworthy British subject or firm to the 'tTmikh who would manage the mining md sales m his behalf 'm suitable terms to be negotiated through the msidenoy*. Pr. Ilorl&amp;y would he glad to he favoured mth Sir E. drey's on this proposal. All that seems actually nscsssory is that the new omoession to be granted by the Sheikh shouid.be in a form to safeguard his interests and sovsretg ^ rights in the island which the omosllsd concession failed to do. The grant of' a fresh concession would he in aocordm^ with the Sheikh's mm vims expressed Pi the concluding words of his letter of the 11th Safar 1888 to Hasson Smaiyeh which said: 'You are not allmmd to take oxide of 'iron from Abu HUsa Island on tlm condition mtah you ham 'mdc micas the business is put on a footing of which m 'bleed not fear the consequences*. (5) Hr. 11 or ley voultl suggest* for Sir E.

The Germans claim that Esa had really known and approved of the grant of the contract. Docu- ments forwarded by Germans do not hear this out, and documents now for warded by Cox suggest that this was not the case. Deed of contract between -tlassan Samaiyeh and German firm was executed on/'lst June 1906 It ffave monopoly of purchase for four years to German firm and preference for new contract on expiry of old one.

First German point, viz., that Sheikh Sagar’s uncle Salim is owner of mines and that, as he gave lease An his capacity as owner, Sagar had no right to annul it. Papers forwatded with German case contain nothing m support of this History of island shows that it is integral part of dominions of Sheikh of Shargah, used for grazing of live stock of ruling Sheikh and famdy, and m 1884 Sheikh Sagar, in two letters to Resident referred to fact that Salim only resided in island on sufferance. Sagar has also continued to send his own live stock to island annuallv for grazing when necessary. It is a fact that Salim has by personal and verbal arrangements with Sagar enjoyed income of Abu Musa Island since he, Salim, was ousted from Sheikhdom by Sagar. This is admitted by Sagar, who says that he has allowed Salim to retain rent for mines paid under the terms of contract now m question to stop Salim’s complaints as to inadequate allowance given him by Sagar. _ But Salim has now categorically disclaimed all right of ownership of island m letter to Sagar, dated 21st February 1908, and has declared that m granting lease he merely acted as proxy for Sagar. Genuineness of tins declaration is supported by examination of agreements between Sagar and Salim, dated 1883, 1884, and 1889 respectively. They contain no mention of Salim’s right to revenue of Abu Musa Island, and show that his duel means of support was fixed stipend granted to him by Sagar. In a letter to Resident, dated the 11th October 1902, Sheikh referred to fact that Salim had leased produce of mines while acting as Regent of Shargah. Inereiore German argument on Salim’s rights breaks down. 1 aragraph 2. Second German point, viz., that even if power to grant lease emanated from Sheikh, his cancellation of it was unjustifiable. Sheikh is law to himself, and has absolute right to do as he likes, subject to such general control as we exercise. The Germans have admitted Sheikh’s territorial rights over island. Agreement under which Sheikh took personally a commercial share in undertaking was for so long as mines are workable and m lease, and contained nothing to limit his rights as Sheikh to cancel lease under any circumstances, if he chose. Sheikh had good reasons for cancelling lease, viz.:— ( 1 :) of .monopoly to foreigner not contemplated in lease, especially alter he had received a general warning in December 1904, from Residency Agent at Shargah, not to deal with Wonckhaus without reference to Resident. (2.) Hassan Samaiyeh therefore had given monopoly without the consent ol a partner, Esa bin Abdul Latif, who accordingly complained to the Sheikh of being ignored. Esa particularly objected to fact that heading of contract described Hassan as owner and holder of concession.” Germans claim that Esa had really known and approved of grant of contract. Documents forwarded by Germans do not bear this out, and documents now forwarded by Cox suggest that this was not the case. Deed of contract between Hassan Samaiyeh and German firm was executed on 1st June 1906. It gave monopoly of purchase for four years to German firm, and preference for new contract on expiry of old^ one. In reporting agreement on 11th June 1906 to Esa s father, Abdul Latif, who is our Residency Agent at Shargah, Hassan concealed existence of monopoly and preferential right of renewing Omission of this letter from German case is significant. Abdul Latif, in replying on 14th June, requested Hassan to refrain from making lease or deed of contract with the German.

Cox writes that he has been through Abdul Latif s correspondence, and found some office copies missing or too faint to be deciphered, but adds that he was quite frank, and gives his S ° e “^ word &gt; which Cox has no reason to doubt, that we need not fear that any letter of his, of which an office copy is not forthcoming, contains anything moie than appears in letters hitherto produced. As regards Esa’s request tor cancellation, it is especially important to note that until he got text of lease, he knew nothing of objectionable description of Hassan in it as owner and holder of concession.” Paragraph 3. Third Germans’ claim, viz. that, in any case, consent of hsa or other partners to action taken by Hassan was not necessary as latter was managing partner on behalf of others. Evidence produced by Cox disproves this, and German Consulate dragoman went to Bunder Abbas on d5th November 1907, and tried, apparently without success, to induce Nejef- bm-Ali, a claimant to a share in concession, to sign a document agreeing to su b-contract. ° Paragraph 4. Wonckhaus has endeavoured to strengthen his case by securing an actual share in original concession. The purchase of this share was, however, effected after the arrangements for the cancellation of the lease had been made, and it does not in any way diminish Sheikh’s right to determine lease. The purchase was clearly a mere afterthought. It affords an argument m justification of Sheikh’s action, since, by its terms, the German^ firm was admitted, without the Sheikh’s consent, to a leasehold interest m the island. This was contrary to Sheikh’s assurance that he had given to I blitical Resident, that he would do no such thing without the knowledge of the British Government. It might have led to an infringement of treaty of 1892. Paragraph 5. Our case appears to be strong and unshaken by German case. Paragraph 6.

Memorandum showing the connection of the Jowasim Clan, the Ruling Chief of Shargah, and Sheikh Salim bin Sultan, respectively, with Abu Musa Island as indicated by the Archives of the Bushire Residency. More than a century and half ago the Chiefs of the Jowasim Clan of Arabs at that time paramount in authority on what was known as the “ Pirate Coast” of Oman, with head-quarters at Ras-el-Khaima and Shargah crossed over to the Persian Coast with their war craft and captured the part of Lingah and other places on the Coast. There they remained in occupation for upwards of a century, one of the ruling family from Ras-el-Khaima acting as Chief of the branch of the tribe which remained on the Persian Coast; having its seat of government at Lingah, but remaining subject!to the overlordship of the Ruling Chief of the headquarters of the tribe, then at Ras-el-Khaima. At that time as now practically all the islands in the Gulf were perma nently or at certain seasons tenanted by Arab tribes; and several of them, including Abu Musa, by the Jovvasim. In the pearling season the tribal fishing boats would have recourse to these islands for water or for refuge from stress of weather; in the spring, after rain, the various Shaikhs would smd their horses and flocks for grazing, and in the winter parties of their subjects habitually sojourned in the islands for fishing purposes. Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became as it were permanent settlers there and quarrels began to arise between parties of them and their kinsmen from Oman sojourning on the islands, when their grazing interests clashed. In order to put an end to this recurrent friction the Chiefs of the clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to be used exclusively by different portions of the tribe. Under this understanding Abu Musa fell to the Shargah branch and the arrangement then made has never been disturbed. While not ordinarily intervening in the internal politics of the Jowasim or other Arab tribes in treaty relations with them, the British authorities have in practice recognised this position, and, in pursuance of their time-honoured policy of maintaining the “ Maritime Truce,” the principles of which, as we have specifically notified to the tribes, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters. We have interfered in the present instance in so far as that when alien tribesmen from Debai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa Sir Bu • \i, rNuair islands, they have been directed either to desist nr acquiescence of the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah in their proceedings. b 6 from 1 igl^^ fX^hero^ZL 100114 ' t,y attempted to msmuate a claim to Abu Musa, hut in 1888, then “h ^’cWm was hrst asserted, in conjunction with a similar one in connection w th SW?

Ruling Chief of Shargah was Shaikh Salim bin feultan.^ He had neld the reins of tribal government for about 18 years hut his regime was a weak and unpopular one. ’ This Shaikh had taken a particular and enterprising interest in Abu This is the fact, but perhaps it is unnecessary to iVTuSU and had planted SOUie date STOVOS mention it, especially in replying to the German and built himself a TOUgh residencettere. + i* i i*, spring of 1883 he was according to his habit spending a few weeks there with the tribal horses and flocks and , acl left his nephew, Sagar bin Khalid, a young man of about 25 years a^e, m charge of his headquarters at Shargah. J ° Among these Arab Chieftains the principle of “ might is right ” prevails and Sagar bin Khalid finding that the majority of the tribesmen of the principality were tired of his uncle’s rule and ready to support himself in a coup detat^eized the government and proclaimed himself Shaikh on 4th April 1883, informing the Resident of his action. r 4 .T. T ^ e -i • Bntlsb authorities leave these questions of personnel to the will of the tribes concerned and usually do no more than recognise the individual whom the support and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins of government; and in this case Shaikh Sagar received recognition in due course. As soon as he had made sure of his position he addressed the Resident (o^ 17th May 1883) saying that he now proposed to expel Shaikh Sahm from Abu Musa. In reply he was reminded that the Residency had in former years specifically notified to the Trueial Chiefs that the principles of the Mantmie Truce must be held to apply to the islands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf and that he should consequently endeavour to arrange a peaceable settlement with his uncle. 13 Simultaneously Shaikh Salim left Abu Musa for Lingah and thence wrote to the Resident asking his good offices. He in turn was advised to remam in Kingah (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until ne could come to an understanding with Shaikh Sagar. Being in the weaker position Salim soon came to terms and a settlement guaranteed by the Shaikhs of Ras-ebKliaima and Debai was arrived at inJuly 1893 under which Shaikh Salim was to receive a pension of 600 dollars per annum for his maintenance. A cony of the settlement is attached. Shaikh Salim however, found it difficult to refrain from intriguing against his nephew, in the hope, no doubt, of getting back the Shaikhdom. Thus, on 21st January 1884, Shaikh Sagar complained to the Resident of his uncle’s conduct and in the course of his letter he wrote . At present you are aware that Salim resides on Bu Musa which is an island dependent on Sharg'ih, and I cannot spare it to others and perhaps Salim may create some disturbance which may break the Maritime Peace I beg therefore that you will kindlv warn Salim and inform him that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa he must do so peaceably, you being his guarantee that nothing wrong will be done by him of a nature to disturb the Maritime Peace, But should he not choose to obey it will be your choice either to remove him from the island or to leave us to settle the matter between us and in that case we should not he called to account^ in _ the event of our attacking one another. I leave the matter to your disposition.*’ In reply the Shaikh was informed that if either party broke the Maritime Peace he would be promptly repressed. About this time the Shaikhs of Ras-el-Khaima and Behai also complained to the Resident against Shaikh Salim’s violation of the agreement, guar- n.s it had been bv themselves. On 14th February following Shaikh Sagar again wrote to the Resident politely urging that it was all very well for hini to say that whoever broke the Maritime Peace would be repressed, hut reminding him that Abu Musa was his, Shaikh Sagar’s property—a hereditary appanage of Shargah. He added: “If Salim wants to live there and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs, or disturb the Maritime Peace, so he it; but I cannot dispense with this island, which is of the greatest use to me. I beg therefore that you will plainly write to me on the subject and likewise instruct your Agent.” On this letter was recorded an office note to the following effect : “ Shaikh Sagar seems to insist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the Resident that he will not do anything to disturb him, Shaikh Sagar, or the Maritime Peace.” On 5th April Shaikh Sagar wrote the Resident another letter pressing for a reply to the above. He added that he had communicated his precise object in writing to the Residency Agent, who would explain it. This was that now that spring had arrived he wished to send his horses as usual for grazing and was not sure whether Shaikh Salim would leave them and their caretakers in peace. If the Resident would not allow him to make his own arrangements for ensuring safety of life and property on the island he wanted an assurance from the Residency that his stud would not be molested by Shaikh Salim. Shaikh Salim, however, who was now getting into financial straits, solved the difficulty himself. He made an appeal to the Residency alleging that Shaikh Sagar and the guarantors of the agreement of 1883 had not stood by the terms of it; that they had taken away the State horses which, as Shaikh of Shargah, he had with him on the island when his nephew ousted him from the Shaikhdom: that he, Shaikh Salim, had had to sell all he possessed to maintain himself and now had nothing left; and that he had now come to beg his nephew to provide him with the wherewithal for a bare living. He declared that if he got this he would remain in peace and quietude. Finally he begged our Agent to intercede for him and to induce Shaikh Sagar to act up to the agreement. By the advice of the Residency Agent, Shaikh Sagar, who had found the 600 dollars somewhat too much his purse, consented to pay his uncle a reducedallowance of 400 dollars annually, half of which only was to be paid in cash and the other half in grain and other articles. He also promised to assign to Shaikh Salim the revenue of the island of Sir Abu Nuair, which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring in about 200 dollars more. A document in the above sense was drawn up at a meeting at Ajman and there ratified. When reporting the conclusion of this agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Shaikh Salim was at present going on a visit to Ras-el- Khaima and that his family would spend the hot weather there and the winter on Abu Musa. Things went on smoothly after this for a time, but the two Shaikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and in April 1889 our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack on Shargah. On getting wind of his uncle’s intentions Shaikh Sagar, as usual, asked the advice of the British Agent and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendly meeting between the two, resulting in the framing of a third agreement in supersession of the preceding ones. This was to the following effect : Shaikh Sagar bound himself to pay bis now aged uncle the 400-dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within certain limits. He also offered to take Shaikh Salim into his service as Vazier or chief adviser and to consult him in all matters affecting the interests of the State. Shaikh Salim in turn undertook to serve his nephew in obedience and loyalty. .No mention was made of Sir Bu Nuair in this agreement because it had hitherto disappointed previous expectations and had not brought in anything. The above has held good and no further documentary agreement has since been necessary. On the conclusion of it Shaikh Salim came to live in Shargah as his nephew’s adviser and for some years past the two have been the best of friends: so much so that when Shaikh Sagar leaves his headquarters, which he not infrequently does, he always leaves his uncle to officiate in the Government of Shargah, as he did, for instance, on his departure for the Mecca pilgrimage in 1897-1898. It was on return from the said pilgrimage in 1898 that his uncle in formed him of the grant of the Abu Musa oxide concession ; when, in view of the fact that since the reduction of his pension from 600 to 400 dollars Shaikh Salim had always been complaining of the paucity of his income, Shaikh Sngar as an act of generosity decided to let his uncle enjoy the 250 dollars annual rent fixed for the concession and thereby cease to have cause for further discontent. From first to last, however, Shaikh Sagar’s acquiescence in his uncle’s enjoyment of the produce and income of the island in question has been purely a personal and verbal arrangement which Shaikh Sagar might at any time have terminated had he chosen to do so. No deed whatever, according to the statements of the two Shakhs themselves, has ever been given by Shaikh Sagar to his uncle in regard to this island, although the island of Sir Abu hiuair did find mention in the second agreement as abovementioned, dropping out again in the third and last because it had never brought in any income. Stronger proof of the status of the island could hardly be wanted than the declarations furnished by the two Shaikhs themselves. P. z. COX. Dated 28th iebruary 1908.i. 6 Agreement No. 1 of 1883. The Agreement of 1883 between Shaikh Sagar and Shaikh Salim, Note. In replying to the German case it seems unnecessary for us in the first in- stance to go behind the third agreement of 1889 which is still in operation, the others having lapsed. If, however, it is considered advisable for us to refer to this agreement of 1883 in detail, it would seem prudent, in order to preclude misunderstanding, to give an explanation of the reference to Abu Musa island in tho text of Shaikh Salim’s undertaking. Read by itself the terms of this document would perhaps enable the German Government to argue corroboration for the assertion made in their case to the effect that Shaikh Salim was the owner of the island and not Shaikh Sagar. In point of fact the explanation of the reference is natural and simple. As stated in my memorandum on the status of Abu Musa it had been the custom from time immemorial for the Shaikhs of Shargah to send their State and private horses and livestock over to graze on the island every spring; and at tde time when Shaikh Sagar seized the government from his uncle, it will be remembered that the latter was spending his yearly visit to the island and had a number of the State horses with him. After the coup d'etat the disposal of these horses became one of the chief difficulties in the way of a friendly settlement; but eventually Salim had to give them up. While therefore, in the interests of peace, acquiescing in Shaikh Salim’s taking up his residence on the island for the present Shaikh Sagar naturally did not wish to forego the convenient practice of sending his stud over to graze; on the other hand, for him to have sent them over without being able to take any adequate steps to ensure their safety would have been to put in Salim’s hands a simple and effective means of annoying his nephew by inter fering with the horses. Shaikh Sagar therefore got Salim to give him a written assurance that while he resided in Abu Musa Shaikh Sagar could send over his horses as usual without apprehension.

I also received letters from Sagar bin Khalid and the Chief of Ras-el-Khaima by the hand of their Agent, Yusuf-ul-Shareef, asking me to assist in effecting a fair arrangement between Salim and Sagar, so that Salim might not attack Shargah. I saw Sagar and understood that he wanted an arrangement. He asked me to guarantee the conditions, but I refused. I and the Agent, Yusuf-ul-Shareef, consulted and approved of the Chiefs of Ras-el-Khaima and Debai being guarantees, to which Sagar consented. I, Yusuf-ul-Shareef, and Haji Mahomed Khalfan then went to Salim at Debai. He consented to what we proposed. The documents of which I enclose copies were given by Sagar and Salim to each other. Besides the conditions mentioned in them, Sagar will deliver up all arms, household utensils, slaves, male and female, and their families belonging to Salim. When these arrive at Debai Salim will send a man to Lingah to make over the horses there to Sagar according to list. I wished Sagar and Salim to meet, but they did not consent. On 18th July Sagar took the docu ment of agreement and left for Shargah. It is understood that Salim will not concern himself about the other sons of Sultan bin Sagar. I hear that Ahmad bin Sultan is going to Debai. Ibrahim bin Sultan is at Ajman,Salim s intention is to stay at Abu Musa during tlie spring and at other seasons at Ras-el-Khaima and Ajman. Agreement of 1883. I, Sagar bin Khalid, bind myself by this deed to pav to Salim bin Sultan every year 600 dollars in 4-raonthly instalments of *200 dollars each, two- thirds in produce and one-third in money. I will also pay the debts contract ed by him while Chief of Shargah. His property in Shargah and Debai, shops, houses, and date trees are his: he may appoint an agent to manage them and* I will protect him. If Salim should live in a town other than Shargah or its dependencies and I should have a difference with the town, he will not interfere. All his people may visit Shargah in safety while he respects this compact between us. SAGAR BIN KHALID. Dated Ramadan 1300. I, Hamaid bin Abdullah, am security for Sagar bin Khalid.

Similarly if my “ father *”, Shaikh Salim, should desire to live iu one of the townships other than Shargah or its suburbs, such as Khan or Haira, and if there should be any enmity between me and them, he will not concern himself with it and piovided that I have not molested him (Shaikh Salim) he will not hinder me from hostilities against the people of the town where he resides. The second condition will be that everybody belonging to him is at liberty to do his business at Shargah and shall be immune from harm either as to person or property, so long as Shaikh Salim abides by the conditions existing between him and me according to these presents. This is ratified by an oath in the name of God and of honest dealing and no artifice or deception shall enter into these terms. Dated 11th Ramadan 1300. 17th July 1883. SAGAR BIN KHALID.

After compliments.—On. the 14th June Shaikh Salim bin Sultan sent me word that he wanted to see me at Ajraan. I saw him there on the 16th June. He complained that the Shaikh of Shargah had broken the promise and agreement made by him, copy of which I sent to you in my report No. 84, dated°l 9 th July 1888 and which bore my signature. He said this was done without any fault on his part; they took away the horses he had with him and the persons who had guaranteed the arrangement also failed to stand by tbeir promise because they were related to the Shaikh of Shargah. That he had sold all he owned to meet his expenses, and now possessed nothing ; that he was there to ask the Chief of Shargah to furnish him with a bare living and if he got this he would remain in peace and quietude; that h® wanted me to intercede for him and make the Chief of Shargah stand by his agreement; if he did not do so, then he would break his promise tome not to cause disturbance to Shargah and its dependencies; that he was determined to create disturbance by land ; that he could not suffer longer ; either he would gain his object or die in the attempt. I replied to him that I could not force the Chief of Shargah, but I would give him my advice and use good offices for a compromise that it was not advisable for him to create disturbance and attack the place as then the Resident would hold him responsible for any losses which the British subjects might sustain. I found that he was quite determined to attack Shargah and that some of the Bedouins, as the Beni Katab Naeem and the Chief of Hamryah hadtheir assistaaoe in the attack which was to be on the whlle the &amp; enera lity of Shargah people do not like the rule of L;.““,Sair'* k ral ' i h “ i1 o ' w™n •« th. * l ' S1 '* iih ''■*»«&gt;».«« »a On this the Chief of Sharjah consented to arrant him a „r i/,a dollars annually, half to be in cash and the rest in &lt;-rain and nth!' ,• f 00 and he promised to grant him also the revenue of the island of Si^ Bn Ivlir’ which sometimes amounts to about 200 dollars.

After compliments .—As yon are aware, on the 19th Mnharram* 1325 we decided to annul the deed of contract for the oxide contract of Abu Musa, which was in the hands of Haji Hassan bin AH Samaiyeh and his partners, and subsequently we expelled his workmen from the island. We now learn that Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh on 10th October 1907, that is to say, after 8 months after the annulment of the concession, sold a share in the oxide company which had formerly belonged to Yusuf bin Abdullah. How coaid this person possibly sell a share in a concern which a long time since had been done away with wholly and entirely. And seeing that the pro cedure of Haji Hassan is against all principles and his motive is to create confusion, it is necessary for me to inform you that I am unable to accept or a°Tee to this action, and in view of the fact that the buyer and seller are dependents of the British Government, I request that you will take steps for the suppression of these objectionable prooeedings. And whereas you have enquired of me the nature of Shaikh Salim’s connection with Abu Musa, your honour must be fully aware of the circum stances, namely that since the time of my assuming the government of Shargah and its dependencies, I have left the income of the island of Abu Musa for the subsistence of my uncle, Shaikh Salim, so long as he remains steadfast in his loyalty to and concord with myself; and his sojourn tere has b:en with my acquiescence and at my will, and my honoured* 30th May 1884. mmsm /' 12 18th Muharr am 1326, Dated tkG 21 st February 1908.

After compliments.—I writs to inform Yoar Honour that whereas I have come to know that Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh and the friends who advise him assert that the oxide mines which arc in the island of Abu Musa are my personal property, and that the lease which was issued by me to Haji Hassan and his partners was given by me in my own right and not by I fear that this statement may become a cause of ill-f* elm b .tvyeen u . i have therefore thought it necessary to apprise Your Honour of it and to acquaint you with what is in mv mind, namely, that X absolutely made no such claim ac that which interested parties allege; and I hereby admit that when I ca before you in the presence of the British Agent on 4th Shaaban 1301, I had no pension or means of subsistence, and you were kind enough to place the island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate theiein and reap from it the means o£ subsistence ; and you did so conditionally t la showed Royalty and concord and obedience to you in al respects; and I am weT aware that the island in question and the mines which are m it be ong to Your Honour and that you might at any time deride to take^ the island from my charge. It is at your disnosition to do so, and I have no status or power to gainsay you. And when I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was oSiciat.ug on your behalf and the concession was given by proxy for you and I was wel aware that on your return from the pilgrimage to Mecca, it you considered that my action in the matter of the concession was good, you would contnm what I had agreed to; and if in your opinion it was objectionable, you could annul it eith!? at the time or at any other time ; and 1 altogether disapprove of the proceedings of Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh in regard to tins lease and in ^respect of wnatever action you_ took in this connection, that is, m cancellin 0, the document I was acting in accord wit.i you, seemg that your action was taken in consultation with me and for the interests of u- all ; and in no respect have I any view contrary to yours ; and it is in order to dispel doubt from vour mind and as an evidence ot my singleness of view with you that I have written this so that you may have congiz mee.

P. Z. COX, II (a). (i) Correspondence showing that Hassan Samaiyeh intentionally deceived and kept his third partner in the dark throughout the proceedings in regard to the deed of agree' ment with the German Firm, (ii) Also statement regarding the working of the Oxide Company by Fsa Bin Abdul Latif. Summary of correspondence between Hassan Samaiyeh and others regarding the execution of the lease with the German Firm. The correspondence shows that Hassan acted with duplicity all through. The disposition of Mr. Wonckhaus to interest himself in Abu Musa Island and its oxide became evident at the end of 1904, when in reporting his visit 26th Nov. 1901 . to the island the Residency Agent, Lingah, recommended that a warning be administered at Shargah. This was done and .Hassan Samaijeh likewise received a caution from Abdul Latif, the Residency Agent, and his son, mete Hassan Samaiveh’s letter 0 ^, T toak of 30th January 1905, in which he flouted the idea of his ever letting the ant l9P5 - German get a footing. Nothing of importance was heard of the matter until reports of some objectionable compact between Samaiyeh and Wonckhaus reached the Resident in August 1906, and on investigation it appeared that there was evidently truth in the report in question and that Hassan Samaiyeh was endeavouring to throw dust in the eyes of Esa and his father and to keep the precise terms of the deed of contract secret from them. Thus on 7th June he had written to Mr. Tigrane Malcolm of Bushire, ?th June 1906 . who claims to have a subsidiary share in the concern ; and on 11th June to Abdul Latif telling them of his deal with Wonckhaus, but not mentioning the existence of any formal deed and glazing over the fact that an absolute j monopoly of purchase had been granted to the German Firm. In the une 1906 * German case the letter is conspicuous by its absence from the enclosures. Abdul Latif, our Native Agent on the Trucial Coast, after the warnings which he had given to Hassan, not suspecting Hassan’s good faith and attracted no doubt by the prospect of reaping profit from a concern from which during ten years past his son had derived no benefit, did not appreciate the real significance of Hassan’s naive remark that “ if more was extracted, Wonckhaus would be a taker of it,” and in the absence of the text of the document was misled into expressing his satisfaction. He clearly did so however on the supposition that no lease or formal deed had been executed, for in intimating his provisional approval he repeated his former caution in this regard. 14th June 1906 In reply Hassan pooh-poohed his apprehensions and assured him that 6th July isoe. there had been nothing more than a simple sale of oxide. It was now that Hassan began a series of lies intended to facilitate concealment of the text of the contract with Wonckhaus as long as possible.16 23rd August 1906. 27th August 1906. 14th October 1906. 7th November 1906. 2nd November 1906 11th November 1906 16th December 1906 23rd January 1906. Thus when asked by Mr. Malcolm for a copy of the agreement he replied that it was in German and that he could get no one to copy it This letter was forwlrded to the Resident by Mr. Malcolm of Bushire, who had mentioned the matter in conversation a few days before. Recourse was then had to the Residency Agent, Shargah, but nothing resulted for some time. Meanwhile Mr. Malcolm ^ ear . d a | a ^ who now excused himself from sending a copy on the grounds that the “ German” had enjoined secrecy upon him. The Residency Agent, Shargah, wrote two or three times for a copy, meanwhile the Resident being on tour at the end of ® ct °^ r 3 ^ ?a t and ascertained that a copy was still not forthcoming, but d . ™ the nurport of the letter from Hassan to Abdul Latif, dated 11th June which was^now shown to the Resident, Esa was advised to write and repudiate the oo o. On 2nd November the Lingah Agent forwarded a copy obtained after a pnnd deal of pressure. It was found to be m English and not German as pretended by Hassan and tbe terms of it were in parts open to objec ion. A few days after giving this copy to our Lingah Agent, Hassan wrote to Abdul Latif and put him off with the obviously false statement that the deed . had been in Bombay for a month and a half with his son. Abdul Latif however continued to press for it and at last on 16th December Hassan sent a copy to him. On getting it, or soon after, Abdul Lati wrote on behalf of his son and objected to the terms ol it. Meanwhile authority was received by the Resident from the Government of India to discuss the question with the Sheikh of Shargah, and m the result the latter addressed Hassan a communication intimating the nullification ot the 21st February 1906 . Concession, Esa bin Abdul Latif protesting against Hassan s conduct simult aneously. In spite of the evidence to the contrary fortho uning in his previous letters, Hassan Samaiyeh now began to pretend that he had sent Abdul Latif a copy of the deed when first asked, and that the latter had agreed after seeing it. He also complained to the Eesidency in an undated letter, received 12th March 1907, making the same allegation, namely, that he had sent Abdul Latif the terras of the Agreement in English and Arabic in the first instance and that it had been agreed to by Esa and his father. This appears to be absolutely untrue. See Hassan’s letter of 11th June to Abdul Latif and subsequent correspondence showing that he intentionally kept the terms secret. It is to he noted that the letter of Abdul Latif to Hassan, dated 27th March 1907,^ is the same as enclosure 10 m the German case, hut there is some divergence in our translation. The two letters, dated 30th March 1907, hut unsigned, though apparently from Hassan to Abdul Latif and the Sheikh of Shargah, call for no special sotb March 1907. remark. Erom the above papers it will he seen that whereas the Residency Agent at Lingah was vigilant and astute throughout in connection with the conduct of this^oncession, the behavour of our Shargah Agent was not altogether free from blame. The truth was, I think, that he is not a man of business, and did not at first realise the serious possibilities of Hassan Samaiyeh’s relations with the German Eirm. He as a rule takes a press copy of private letters issued by him, hut on his going through his books with me it was found that one or two items wanted, could not be traced ; either copies were not taken or the press copy is so faint as to be unidentifiable. Since he realised the way in which he had been deceived by Hassan Samaiyeh he has been quite frank with me and gives me his solemn word that he fears nothing that Hassan S tmaiyeh can produce either in his own writing or his son’s, and that we need not fear that 8th March 1907. 12th March 1907. 17 th March 1907.any letter of his of which an office copy is not forthcoming contains anvthmsr otherwise* aPPearS 1Q k^* -8 hitherto P rodu ced.

From—The Residency Agent, Shargah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. After Compliments.—In reply to your letter No. 429, dated 3rd December 1904, I beg to inform you that, as directed by you, I informed the Chief of Shargah and his uncle Sheikh Salim bin Sultan that they should not enter into any agreement or arrangement with Robert Wonckhaus, the German Merchant, before consulting the Resident and that they have assured me that they would not engage in the matter without the knowledge of the Resident. News reached me that the said Robert Wonckhaus visited Abu Musa, inspected the red oxide mines, etc., and left the Island. The arrivals from Bu Musa report that Robert Wonckhaus had promised to return to the island in a few days. Note. —There should come in here a letter which would appear to have been addressed by 12th Zilkaadeh 1322 Abdul Latif, Residency Agent, Shargah, to Hussan Samaiyeh, on the iyt]i j amittry i; j 05 , in which he repeated bis previous warning to Hassan against entering into any contract with Mr. Wonckhaus.

From—H assan bin Alt Samaiyeh, Lingah, To— Abdul Latif bin Abdur Rahman, Shargah. After QompUments .—'I have read your letter of the 12th instant (19th January 1905) with pleasure and understood its contents. During my interview with you we held a conversation about tlm visit to Bu Musa Island of Wonckhaus, the German, and you said you heard it was m connection with the lease of that island and you warned me not to let him approach me. Please note that the fact is this as I informed you, that Wonckhaus visited the island merely to inspect the oxide saying that it he approved (the oxide) he would perhaps communicate with me mth regard to the price and would probably buy some. This was his object. You should not think that I would fail to let you know if he communicated with me on the subject which you indicate. We could not allow this sort of interference: from anyone especially on the part of these persons. You may rest assured. On seeing the oxide he approved that from one of the mines and returned toLingah and says that he will perhaps buy 300 tons if he obtains reasonable rates of freight. He left for Bushlre some time ago and has opened a branch there for the transaction of business. N ote .—The deed of contract between Hassan Samaiyeh and the German firm was executed on 1st June 1906. Meanwhile nothing had been received on the subject from the Shargah Agent since his letter No. 14 of 16th January 1905, and was not received for some months later. Hassan now proceeds to tell Abdul Latif and Mr. Malcolm of the contract, but in both correspondences shows great disinclination to produce a copy of the agreement, the fact being, that he has therein given a monopoly of which he is anxious that they should now know. His letters are clearly calculated to mislead on this point.. Dated 4th Rabi II 1324. 28th May 19U6. From— Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh, To—M r. T. Malcolm. After Compliments.—1 beg to say that I have made an agreement with; Mr. Wonokhaus that he should buy red oxide from the island of Abu Musa. I settled with him that he should ship 2,000 tons every year from the island and I settled the price with him at 15 shillings per ton; and a commission is to be charged thereon. We Lave to deliver the oxide on board the steamers and Mr. Wonckhaus should pay boat-hire at 10 annas per ton. (Other) expenses are to be borne by us.. If God pleases, it wiU prove to be prosperous. I have concluded an agreement with him for a period of four years. Should we be able to obtain more than 2,000 tons red oxide, he will take it. The work will begin from 1st June 1906. This is a fortune which God has destined to us. If God pleases, this work will go on regularly. And it is arranged that when we receive a telegram from them advising that a steamer comes to ship red oxide, they should then pay us one half of the price of what is to be shipped by the steamer. The remaining half should be paid when the steamer finishes shipping the consignment.

As regards the agreement which we have German for the sale of red oxide, I have to tell you that we settled with him that 2,000 tons should be shipped every year and that if we got out more W °l 1 d be j a taker of lt&gt; 1 have setfcled the price with him at 5 shillings per ton and we have to bear all the expenses and deliver the oxide on board the steamers. Praise be to God, this is a god-send and will make up tor the past. The arrangement will continue for four years, and I have taken from him an advance of Rs. 2,000. He has made conditions with us for the shipment of 200 or 150 tons per diem. Th® work begins from the ist June iOOS and I have written to my son Abdulla to settle his affairs (m India) at any rate and to come and supervise the work.

Dafod 14th June l906&lt; From—A bdul Latif, Shargah, To Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh, Lingah. After Compliments. —I have received your former and later favours and was glad to hear of your welfare. As to your remarks on the subject of the red oxide in regard to which God decreed that you sold it to the German Wonckhaus at 15 shillings per ton, and whereas it was arranged that you should excavate 2,000 tons per aunum, all the charges to be defrayed by you and he to receive the oxide nett. Very good ; I hope it is auspicious. It will be good fortune after trouble. In any case our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the work, because I think the operations cannot be regulated without him. Please, however, refrain from entering upon any arrangements whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will lead to complaints and claims, because this will be difficult for our over-lords and they will not consent to it; and you are by God’s grace wise and will not commit any negligence or hesitation likely to entangle you, because in these days every one is making a trap with which to catch people. I hope you will not be neglectful in this regard. an y ra ^ e I am glad to hear this news, if we are safe from the world’s tricks more than before. Dated 12th Jumadi I 1324. 5th J nly 1906. From —Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh, To —Abdul Latif. After Compliments. —Tour esteemed letter dated Rabi ul Thani reached me in due course and I understood what you said, in particular regarding the receipt by you of my letter and your comprehension of its purport with refer ence to our transaction with the German. Insh Allah it will turn out well. You told me to take care that he did not get any bond from me (which would enable him) to enter the island. Set your mind at rest, I, your brother, am knowledgable and well versed in matters of business and am far from acting in such a way as you indicate. He has not the presumption to make over tures to me in that direction. Por just as I told you he is only a purchaser of the oxide itself, nothing more. Whether it be he or someone else whoever wants to buy the oxide from me, if the price suits me I shall sell it. Do not let any idea beyond this enter your head. You may rest assured. * * % % (letter goes on to speak of other matters)-I xr WB t V i j i ; 20 Dated the 13th July 1906. From— Hassan bin Ali SamaiyeHj To—Mr. T. Malcolm. Jfter Compliments.—I have received your esteemed letter, dated 26th June, and perused it gladly and understood what yon had stated. You had acknowledged receipt of my letter the contents of which you had ^ understood. As regards the sale to the German, it is satisfactory and I hope it will be fortunate. You had understood the details regarding the sale shipment and boat-hire, but you did not let me know about the eommission ; s it to be charged by us from them or by them from us ? You had written that I should end you a copy of the agreement. Very well, but the agreement ha* been written m * 1 ^ German* and there is no one with us who *Hassan can read and understand English. can write such a hand* The purport of the agreement is accurately the same as I have written to you. „ * „ You had written to me whether we have contracted with the german for 2,000 tons per annum. Yes, we have contracted with him that the quanti y should be 2,000 tons at least, and he can, according to the agreement, take any more quantities which we m iy be able to obtain from the mines. Yon had written whether we can obtain more than this quantity, and if so, whether we can contract with other Europeans, so that you may ne^o la e with them. I have understood this; but I cannot Jive the accurate quantity unless the mine is worked for 2 or 3 months when I will be able to form an idea. • I despatched 45 workmen to the island in the beginning of June but little work is done it being summer and the days being hot. If more than 2,000 tons are obtained, the German is bound to take it from us. We can theretore ma e no other contract. I beg also to inform yon that my son Abdulla has sold about 400 tons more or less at Calcutta. Only the freight is to be paid by us, every maund will be Rs. 1-9 delivery at Calcutta. I have been trying to procure a vessel since a long time. I have now-a-days chartered “AUmghir the vessel belonging to the sons of Khoja (to ship red oxide) at ^Rs. 10 per ton. It is now several days that she has gone to the Island t &gt; ship (the oxide). Thank God my son Abdulla has freed himself from the dispute at Calcutta. He has compromised with them. He has come to Bombay and I will receive his letter from Bombay by this mail, if God pleases. I hope he will not be detained there and that he will settle his case with delta Bania and come to our parts soon. Note ly Resident. Up to this point, I had received no report of this contract with Wonckhaus from the Residency Agent at Sbargah. It was not until some little time after my return to head-quarters on 27th July 1906 after a visit to Simla that Mr. Malcolm, the British protected Armenian Merchant of Bushire, mentioned the matter in a somewhat exaggerated form in the course of a private visit to the Residency. (This was reported in my diary of 12th August). He pro mised to try and get authentic details, but not hearing from him for a few days I wrote to him privately on the subject as below :— Copy of a private letter from Major Cox to Mr. Tigrane \Malcolm, British protected Armenian merchant of Bushire, Bated 23rd August 1906.

As your honour is aware the document of lease was drawn up in Ihe names of three persons, namely, your humble servant Esa bin Abdml Latif Hap Hassan bin Ah Samaiyeh and Abdulla bin Hassan Samaiyeh. ’ 1 !' av ® c ! lm T e T t0 know that on 1st June 1906 f8th Rabi-ul-Thani 1324) * 6 Ha i\ Hassai ? entered into a contract with a European merchant named Wonckbaus without consulting me, and that according P to the terms of the document he bound himself and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the red oxide for a period of four years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this agreement and bound himself without con- ™' tln ?, J 16 , p / evl&lt; ' us , to the dewing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract for you to examine ; kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance m taking the necessary steps for the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I have written to Haji Hassan Samaiyeh expressing my disagreement to tins contract, but be has sent me no answer. _ Finally I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract in the beginning of which begins as follows ; “ Contract between Haji Hassan bin Ah Samaiyeh of Lingah, owner and holder of the Abu Musa Concession, and Mr. Robert Wonckhaus of Lingah.” Now Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me giving him any general power in regard to ac-ion “k® take re ®P e °ting the lease, etc.; how then has Haji Hassan the right thus to mention himself only without consulcing or referring to his partners of whom I am one.

Enclosure 14 of German Case. After Compliments.—I beg to state that on 18th* Muharrum 1325 I * 4th Marcl1 received a letter from Sheikh Sagar bin Khalid, Chief of Shargah, stating that 19 ° 7, Esa bin Abdul Latif has made a complaint that he does not agree to the contract concluded between me and Mr. Wonckhaus, the German, and states that it had been affected without his knowledge. Sheikh Shagar also intimated that he wishes to cancel the contract of the lease of the Abu Musa Island which has been leased by us from Sheikh Salim bin Sultan. As I am one of the dependants of the British Government and as I find that Sheikh Sagar’s letter is meaningless it became necessary for me to give you information before they could misrepresent the matter to you. I possess the original deed of lease of the mines from Sheikh Salim bin Sultan which was drawn up in t 3 r ajnne the yeart 1315 and which will hold good so long as I wish to retain the mines. J 897 to 22 It has been attested by' your Agent, Abdul Latif. Sheikh Sagar has also May 1898 ' entered into partnership with us ,in the mines contract with the knowlege and testimony of your Agent, Abdul Latif. I wrote in due course to your Agent, Abdul Latif, informing him of the terms of the agreement in Arabic opposite to what was written in English in detail and I received a letter from j 14tll Jun0 your Agent dated 21st Rabi Ilj 1324 in which he expressed his pleasure and 1906. gratification as regards the agreement with the German. You will receive herewith a copy of the letter received by me on the subject. Esa had been aware of the matter and agieed thereto. I find from Sheikh Sagar’s letter that he intends to upset our works and cause us loss. Therefore I took a copy of his letter and forward it herewith. Before making any communi cation I thought it necessary to make a representation to you, who are our governor, because all our transactions were made with the knowledge of Esa and Abdul Latif and with their consent. There are with me contracts and agreements in their own handwritings and with their attestations. If he, Esa, was not agreeable he should have prevented me from carrying out the agreement when I received Abdul Latif’s letter dated 21st Babi II.§ I did not carry on this affair with the German except with their f 9 Jg th June consent. My agreement with the German concerns the sale of the commodity only and nothing else and the stuff is offered to the buyer whether he be the German or anyone else. Note.—T his is not true.

I have simply bought oxide from the lease-holders ol the mines on the island of Abu Musa for a specified period in the same way as others buy from you.

The deckiot retts w.th you and action will he taken upon what you may deem prudent. ^ tl ' AUul latif - Dated 17 th the affairs of the Com- f The nature of the circumstances connected with pany of which I was a partner was as follows In the beginning the Company was composed of three persons, namely, Hah Hassati bin Samaiyeh and his son Abdulla bin Hassan and myself On our acquisition of the lease we gave a share to Nakhoda Ah Ahmed Saleh. Subsequently on the return of Sheikh Sagar from the Mecca pilgrimage he too asked us to give him a share in the concern, and we gave him one on 1st Rabi TT 1316 Then the Company consisted of five shares, all equal, bix months later in the month of Ramazan my cousin Tusuf bin Abdulla asked Sheikh Sa^ar to sell his share to him, and as Sheikh Sagar had received no proceeds from the oxide he sold his share to Yusnf. Yusufs partnership continued for about two years. After that Yusuf not receiving any profits from this share during the past two years sold his share to Haji Hassan bamaiyeh, so it resulted that there were now two shares in Haji Hassan s name, one in that of his son Abdulla, one in Nakhoda All’s name and one in my own ; and the rights of us were similar in proportion of our shares, from time to time I paid to Sheikh Salem my share of the yearly rent, and similarly I contributed a portion of the expenses incurred. I in nowise gave any power of attorney to Haji Hassan which would warrant his acting just as he pleased without consulting me in, operations con nected with the concession. On the contrary it was incumbent upon him to act in regard to every transaction in communication with me according as was agreed in the deed which was drawn up between us and Haji Ali Ahmed Saleh; and from the time of the commencement of the lease up to the date of his contract with Mr. Wonckhaus the German, Haji Hassan from time to time had shipped oxide to Calcutta and Sombay and elsewhere, without informing us as he was under obligation to do according to the agreement. If however we heard of any shipment, we used to enquire from him and then he would inform us. And the details of his shipments according to what we have heard from him or from others is recoried in our hooks and amounts approximately to 8,000 tons. On every occasion on which we asked him for an adjustment of the accounts he has put us off with promises of adjustment. It was my father who was in the habit of corresponding with him on my behalf. On 18th Rabi II 1324 Haji Hassan intimated to my father his transaction with Mr. Wonck haus the German, but he neither forwarded any document in original nor a copy thereof; nor did he ever mention at all the execution of any written contract in this regard. He simply mentioned to my father that he was selling to Mr. Wonckhaus 2,000 tons yearly and that if more was available Wonckhaus would take it. Several times my father specifically wrote to Haji Hassan cautioning him against the giving of any bond or written agreement to out siders. In reply he (Hassan) invariably gave assurance that he would not enter into any engagement except the sals of oxide to whosoever would purchase it; and when we learnt that he had executed a deed of contract in connection with this transaction, we made objections to him in regard to it and demanded from him a copy of the deed of contract and repeated the demand several times before he seit it to ns. It was written in English, and when we perused a translation of it into Arabic we saw that it was objectionable. At once I refused to acquiesce in it and intimated to him my non-acceptapee of this document and also complained to Sheikh Sagar in regard thereto.Partnerships ofNaUoclaAU and Mr. T Malcolm and claims ly heir of NaJchoda Mi and Esa btn Abdul Latif against Eaji Hassan bin Alt Samaiyeh on account of his suppression of transactions and accounts and non-division of profits. Note by Resident regarding enclosure (2) of German Case, i.e., the partnership of Nakhoda All m the concession and his rights under the same. I am unable to understand why the German Government have included in their case the mention of Nakhoda Ali and the deed giving him a share in the concern. It is not a part of the original agreement although concluded very soon afterwards and if the document had not found mention in the German Case it would appear to have been difficult for us to have introduced it. Their doing so seems to place in our hands an important instrument in favour of our own case. The circumstances attending the connection of Nakhoda Ali with the concern are briefly as follows. The said Nakhoda was formerly Cargo Landing Contractor at Bushire and well known to the Residency as such; but becoming involved in local Persian politics he found himself in difficulties and had to flee the town, taking refuge for some time at Busreh. When things had quieted down he pro ceeded to Bunder Abbas and obtained the Landing Contract there. Final ly he migrated to Lingah where he died some 2 years ago, being succeeded by his son Nejef who had now lodged a claim with His Majesty’s Consul, Bunder Abbas. When the lease of 10th April 1898 was granted by Shaikh Salim bin Sultan, the plain fact of its grant appears to have been duly reported by the Residency Agent, Shargah (on 31st May 1898) but no report was made by him of the supplementary deed admitting Nakhoda Ali to partnership and the first mention of the latter was contained in a letter dated 28th May 1898 from our Lingah Agent, who, in reporting Lingah news regarding the lease, quoted Nakhoda Ali as the chief concessionaire and Hassan Samaiyeh only as his cosharer. As the Lingah news was divergent from the Shargah report and appeared to be mistaken in regard to Nakhoda Ali, no action was consi dered necessary. Nothing more was heard of the concession for four years, during which period Nakhoda Ali continued to superintend the mining of the oxide on behalf of the partners as prescribed in his agreement. In 1902 another report was received from our Lingah Agent, who, after referring to the Abu Musa Concession, went on to say that he bad reason to believe that Nakhoda Ali was now attempting to obtain from the Shaikh of Shargah a similar lease, of the mines on Sir Bu Nuair Island, and that as he, Nakhoda Ali, was an indifferent character and of late suspected of intriguing with Russian Agents, he advised that the Trucial Shaikhs should be warned to discontinue communication with him. On receipt of this information the Chief of Shargah was addressed by my predecessor Colonel Kemball who asked for a “ copy of the concession said to have been granted to Nakhoda Ali for working the Red Oxide mines on the Island of Abu Musa ’* and also advised the Shaikh to let him (the Resident) see a draft of any concession which he might be intending to grant to Nakhoda Ali in connection with Sir Bu Nuair Island. The Shaikh replied on the 11th October 1902 that he had entered into no lease with anyone in regard to Sir Bu Nuair, and that as regards Abu Musa the concession for mining had been granted to Hassan Samaiyeh, etc., and not to Nakhoda Ali. It is possible Shaikh Sagar may not have been aware of the secondary deed introducing Nakhoda Ali, but the signature of our Agent Abdul Latif was on the document itself and therefore the latter’s behaviour in neither reporting it at the time (in 1898) nor subse quently (1902) can hardly be regarded as quite straightforward. It will be seen that whereas the original lease was dated 18th Zilkaaden 1315 (10th April T898) the document admitting Nakhoda Ali was written a few days later, i.e., during the following month Zilhijjeh (from about 21st April to 19th May 1898). This is consistent with the reference made to it in the statement of Esa bin Abdul Latif now forwarded —vide II a (ii). I now come to the correspondence with Lieutenant Gabriel His Majesty's Consul, Bundar Abbas, from which it will be seen that the Dragoman of theif: ' V I 3 a German Consulate at Bushire (a responsible person who was placed in charge of the German Consulate daring Dr. Listemann’s absence and with whom His Majesty’s Minister in connection with the wreck of the “ Teutonia ” desired me to correspond as the official representative of German interests) on his way down to Shargah with the direct letters of 19th June from Dr. Listemann to the two Shaikhs called at Bunder Abbas and endeavoured to induce Nejef bin Nakhoda AH to sign a document to the effect that the contract concluded between Hassan and the German firm was made with his consent. Nejef refused however and has since lodged a formal complaint with His Majesty’s Consul claiming a share of proceeds of the sale of oxide and the ownership of the implements now at the island together with other separate claims. It is clear from Esa bin Abdul Latif’s recorded statement, that the part ners, Hassan, Abdalla bin Hassan, Esa bin Abdul Batif and Nakhoda AH Ahmed Salen, and later Shaikh Sagar all started with equal shares and endowed with equal rights under each share. Subsequently when the share of Shaikh Sagar passed to Yusuf bin AbduUa and from him to Hassan Samaiyeh, the latter acquired a double share in the profits but otherwise the equality of his position and of obligation in relation to his co-sharers was just the same as before. It is also clear from Nakhoda Ali’s deed of partnership that the partners were all aware and agreed, inter se, that the cognizance and con sent of all partners was obligatory. This was obviously necessary as the partners were scattered, at Shargah, Lingah and Bander Abbas, and anyone of them might be hearing of openings for sales and need to communicate with the others. By their action in sending the Consulate Dragoman to Bunder Abbas to endeavour to induce Nejef bin Nakhoda AH to sign a document probably to be antedated testifying to his cognizance and approval of the German contract, the German claimants have surely committed themselves to the recognition both of the fact that general consultation was necessary and that Nejef bin Nakhoda AH had inherited his father’s share in the Concession and bis rights under it. These two points seem to be of no little importance. It is to be noted that if we may judge from the translation supplied with the German case the documents with Nejef bin Nakhoda Ali, and Hassan Samaiyeh, respectively, are not quite identical.

From— Esa-bin-Abdul Latip, To—The Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compUments : -Wit\i the highest respect I beg to represent that I have learnt that Sheikh Sagar-bm-Khalid in pursuance of the advice of the British Government has arranged that Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, should the German Firm ask hnn to ship the oxide which is lying on the beach of the island and ready for shipment, should be permitted to ship it on specific con- dihons. Seeing that I was originally a partner in the said concession, I have thought it necessary to make the following representation to you. It is now ten years since the commencement of the lease, and in the beginning it was agreed between us partners that no sale or transaction should be completed without consultation with all; and in this past period Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh extracted a large amount of oxide from the mines of Abu Musa Island, and he has been always accumulating it against the time that he might find a purchaser, so that the oxide might be ready for sale. Thus I opine that from the commencement up till now he has sold probably 8,000 tons and now there is probably available in the island some 6,000 tons or more, which they have extracted from the mines a long time since. Out of that is the quantity which, as mentioned above, they have brought down to the seashore for ship ment by German ship; I have not ceased to ask him (Hassan) to render an account but have not obtained it, and Haji Hassan has not given anyone any thing whatever; and I fear that by reason of the termination of the conces sion it is probable that Haji Hassan will put the whole of this oxide to his own credit and seeing that this oxide which is available there was extracted before the incidence of Hassan’s agreement with Wonckhaus which I did not agree to, and m any case previous to the annulment of the deed of lease by Sheikh Sagar, I consider myself entitled to my share in all the oxide that has been extracted. I have therefore informed you and beg from your kindness that Haji Hassan should be called upon to place his accounts before you from first to last, so that he may not alter or change the account and that there be a division according to shares, so that each may take his share.•a 37 Dated the 39th Muharram 1326 22ud February 1908 * From— Sagae bin Khalid, To—Majok P.

Evidence recorded regarding repulsion of German Mow from Alu Musa on 23rd Octoler 1907 in course of which some shots were fired. Statement of Gulum Hassan. Gulum Hassan states on solemn affirmation: , , 1 have been living on Abu Musa as caretaker of gardens and flock for the last 12 or 15 years. qi following 1 are the circumstances under which shots were fired by bnaiJm Sagar s guards in connection with the arrival of Abdalla bin Hassan oamaiyeh in a “boom” (pattern of native craft) from Lingah. The vessel arrived about noon and dropped anchor off the spot where the oxide is shipped Irom about 300 yards to the westward of the heaps on the seashore. A iolly *i° a i U ° P G0 P ® from her after she had anchored and came towards the shore. At this time there were only 10 or 15 men present out of Shaikh Sugar’s guai , e rest were over at the village. Some of those present were now on the seashore m front of the oxide heaps and some above them on the rocks at the side. Those on the shore shouted to the people in the boat not to approach, but as she came on, one, or two, shots were fired from the rocks near the big oxide heap. They were not fired at the boat or dhow, but in the air. The German was in the boat, and at the time one Haji Ali, whom I under* stand to be the German’s clerk, was standing up in the bows of the boat ready to jump off as the boat neared the shore, but I myself called out to him, ‘don t attempt to land as there is no permission for it. ” I heard no answer. Then the guards on the shore called out, “ If you want to ask or see anything send a man ashore, he can see and go back.’* Two negroes, whose names I do not know, then jumped into the water and swam ashore. They only remained a few minutes. They were led up to the huts where Shaikh Ahdulla-bin-Ahmed-bin-Sultan was—(he was in charge of the guard from Shargah)—and they asked him what was the position of affairs aod why had the shots been fired. He replied, “ We are ordered not to let any one land ; if you don’t like it go and get permission from Shaikh Sa^ar ” They then returned to the boat, and the boat to the boom. As the dhow did not show any signs of departing the guard feared she might be intending to stay till dark and try and effect a landing, so about 4 p.m. they began shouting to the dhow warning her to be off, at this time there were waves and some surf. Soon afterwards, I being in the huts at the time, I heard 3 or 4 shots fired by our men, but I did not see what at. 5786 F. D.88 The dhow then I believe moved from her place and went further round to the right, but I did not see any more of her myself. P. z. cox. Abu Musa. The 17th February 1908. Statement of Mattur-bin-Shamhani. Matur-bin*Shamhan states on solemn affirmation : T was one of the guard which Shaikh Sagar sent over to Abu Musa and was nresent on the occasion when shots were fired in connection with the was present on i Lino-ah. The dhow arrived about noon and presence there of ^ ^ sllore . The guards, who had gone over from P Sh S argi were about 80 in all. Of these about 30 were present at the oxide heaps when the boom arrived. After she had anchored a rowing the oxiue neap coataini „„ a |,out 10 persons.

W hen we Taw Abdalla some of us called out, “ Don’t come near, don t come near AhdX” He merelv answered by calling out and gesticulating to his boatmen to row harder. He shouted, “ we will fire at you if you attempt to boatmen to ;d t his ro wers Don’t mind what they say, Zv w Uuotfhoth'' We repeated that we would fire He replied “Ere aw J v .o , ¥e then fired four shots in the air over their heads. I did not fire We should have fired straight at them had not Shaikh Abdalla-bm-Ahmed who was in charge of us, given us orders (which he sent through me) to fire in * 16 o'n our firing they turned back a little and called out to us, “ What is this all about ?” We replied, “ If you want to get news, send two men ashore. On that they sent two negroes (one named Salim) who jumped into the water and swam ashore. They said, “ Why do you stop us from coming ashore seeing Iw the island belongs to the Germans. We replied the island belonged to Shaikh Si'-ar-bin Samaiyeh,” said that Abdulla bin Hassan had not told the German thut and from what they said it appeared that they had brought him, the German, on false pretences. After this conversation we told them they must return to the boom; and we warned them that if the boom did not depart before sundown we should have to fire on her. They then went off to her. The boom did not move, however, and we feared that after nightfall she mi-ht endeavour to make a landing. Accordingly Abdalla-bm-Hamed told three of the ffuard to go to the cliff and fire some shots. They, however, fired six shots above the boom. It was not intended that they should fire at the boom as a matter of fact, I did hear one shot strike her, or strike something other than the water. The man who fired that shot was Abdurralum-bin- Saif of the Holi tribe, who let off his rifle before getting it to his shoulder. After this the boom weighed anchor and got off just at sunset, but they only moved a little way and anchored again opposite the mud enclosure further up. Pour of us then went along the shore parallel and stayed there until three hours after sunset (about 9 p.m.). Then seeing that they were apparently intending to pass the night there, our men fired two more shots m the air above the dhow. She then took her departure. Our object was to fnghien the visitors away. r&gt; P. z. coxIV. Nationality of Mr. Thomas Brown and Eaji Ali TashanJctr. The question of Mr. Thomas Brown's Nationality. . + 7^r. men t ° f T India Wil1 that in my telegram No. 117 dated 12th February I expressed doubts as to Brown’s nationality being British, as stated m the German case, the facts being so far as my knowledge (i) That be had not registered himself in Busbire as a British subject, (li) That neither his accent, nor his bearing, when in Bushire from time to time, gave one any reason to regard him as British. (iii) That to the best of my belief Mr. Wonckhaus or Mr. Brown him self had in conversation, soon after my arrival here, mentioned Ins being a naturalised German. (iv) That the German Consul, Dr. Listemann, who has previously joined my dinner party on Christmas night, expressed his in ability to accept our invitation this year because he was expecting the “ German community ” to spend X’mas with him. One of his guests was Mr. Brown. (v) That Mr. Marling in his despatch No. 281, dated 31st December 1907, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, had quoted Baron von Richthofen, the German Minister, as saying that the Shaikh of Shargah “ had fired on a German subject named Brown.” (vi) That there were other incidential references on my record, to Brown, or Braun, “ the German.” (vii) Finally that though he came to Bushire a few days after the firing incident at Abu Musa he made no report or complaint to me on the subject, nor did he do so at Lingah to the Residency Agent. There were some grounds therefore for the uncertainty that existed. On my making inquiries at Lingah, however, I was assured by Khan Saheb Agha Badr that when Brown first joined Messrs. Wonckhaus’s firm at Lingah from Europe, he possessed a British passport and that clue enable me'’ to trace the reference to him on the Residency Becords. It now appears that on loth June 1901 Mr. Brown passed through Bushire by direct steamer from Europe and having landed while the ship was lying in port, he called on the extra Assistant Resident and asked for a British passport. In support of this request he declared that he had been born of English parents at Hemelengen near Bremen, and in proof of his statement produced a certificate purporting to have been recorded by the provost of Dundee certifying the British Nationality of one John Brown, whom the applicant claimed as his father. A copy of this certificate is on my record and I attach a duplicate of it: When producing this document, Mr. Brown stated that he had obtained it in order to avoid compulsory military service in Germany, which he would otherwise have been obliged to undergo, he having been born and bred in Germany. On the strength of the said document a British passport was issued to Mr. Brown. Before granting him a passport it might have been well had the Residency asked him to produce a birth certificate, for as it is, we have only his word for it that he is the son of the John Brown figuring in the Dundee certificate. Be that as it may, however, I presume that for purposes of the present case we must accept the view that he is actually a British subject, and on the whole it seems advantageous to us that we should do so. For instance whereas in case he were a German, the German Government would perhaps be in a better position to argue that the transfer by Hassan Samaiyeh on 10th or 16th October was a valid contract, now that Brown ism 40 admittedly a British subject, the transaction becomes one British subjects and the British Government are the sole ]u&amp; 0 e* 0 J V. z.

More than a century and a half ago the Chiei s of the Jowasim Clan of Arabs, at that tiine paramount in authority on what was known as the ’Pirate Coast” of Oman, with headquarters at Ras-s1-Ahaima and Shargah, crossed over to the Persian Coast with their war craft and captured the port of Lingah and other places on the Coast. There they remained in occupation for upwards of a century, one of the Ruling family from Ras-el- iihaima, acting as Chief of the branch of the tribe which remained on the Persian Coast; hav ing its seat of government at Lingah, but remain ing subject to the overlordship of the Ruling Chief of the headquarters of the tribe, then at Ras -el - Aha ima. At that time as now practically all the islands in the Gulf were permanently on at cer tain seasons tenanted by Arab tribes; and seve ral of them, including Abu Musa, by the Jowasim. In the pearling season the tribal fishing boats would have recourse to these islands for water or for refuge from stress of weather; in the spring, after rain, the various Shaikhs would send their horses and flocks for grazing, and in the winter parties of their subjects habitually sojourned in the islands for fishing purposes. Time went on and the sections of the Jowasim on the Persian Coast after some generations became assis it; v-ere pspinansiib 3 8'LtjlQps 'trliQp© and Qiicip— psls 'began to apise 'between panties of tliem and theip kinsraen fpom Oman sojoupning on the is lands f when theip grazing interests clashed. In order to put an end to this recurrent fric tion the Chiefs of the Clan came to a friendly understanding under which particular islands were henceforth to he used exclusively hy differ ent portions of the tribe. Under this understand ing Abu Musa fell to the Shargah branch and the arrangement then made has never been disturbed. Uhile not ordinarily intervening in the in ternal politics of the Towasim or other Arab tribes in treaty relations with them,the British Authorities have in practice recognised this position, and, in pursuance of their time hon oured policy of maintaining the 'Maritime Truce*; the principles of which, as we have specifically notified to the tribes, are held to apply to the islands of the Gulf as well as its waters* we have interfered in the present instance in so iar as that when alien tribesmen from ^ebai and elsewhere have attempted to send their flocks for grazing, or otherwise to meddle with Abu Musa Sir Bu Muair islands, they have been direc ted either to desist or first obtain the acquies cence of the Buiing Shaikh of Shargah in their proceedings. It is true that on one or two occasions the Persian Government, apparently from ignorance or misconception of the history of these islands generally, have attempted to insinuate a claim to Abu Musa, but in 1S33, when this claim was first asserted, in conjunction with a similar one In connection with Sirri, Colonel B. C.Boss, for 13 years Resident in the Persian Gulf, writing to Wolff ' s Sir henry Prummond, His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran25 * ' t ' I 1 | 3f f ► I ■» / Teheran, on 23th April 1333, observed; 'The ' claim now put forward to the island of Abu 'Musa has no justification whatever and any at- ' tempt to assert Persian authority there in a ' practical form would lead to disturbance. ' Again in April 1904 when an over zealous Bel gian Customs official proceeded to the island and incontinently hauled down the Shargah flag and hoisted the Persian emblem in its place, the Persian Government were called upon the repair the unwarranted affront and a British man-of-war was sent to see that it had been done and that the Arab flag was replaced with due ceremony. Thus, as far as the Jowasim are concerned the position which existed from time immemorial has been maintained up to the present moment, and every year in the spring, when and after rain has fallen and vegetation made its appearance, the Ruling Shaikh of Shargah and his immediate relations have been in the habit of sending their livestock to graze on the island. So much for the abstract history of Abu Musa (/c&gt; bta. UI- to ot (Art (XJLyjoMj to *~i ZsinrvxOuvo CcoSe. as an appanage of Shargah, We may now turn to the aspects brought into relief by the present misunderstanding in connection with the grant of a Concession for mining oxide on the island. In bhe year 133, the Ruling Chief of Shar— gah was Shaikh Salim bin Sultan. He had held the reins of tribal government for about 13 years but his regime was a weak and unpopular one. ihis ohai'kh had taken a particular and enter prising interest in Abu Musa and had ^planted some date groves and built himself a rough resi dence there. In the sppng of 133R he was accord ing to his habit spending a few weeks there with the tribal horses and flocks and had left his nephew, Sagar bin Khalid, a young man of about,- 'S i m r . * 25 years age. In charge of his headQuarters ah Shargah* Among these Arab Chieftains the principle of 'might is right' prevails and Sagar* bin Khalid finding that the majority of the tribesmen of the principality were tired of his uncle’s rule and ready to support himself in a coup d'etat, seized the government and proclaimed himself e. Shaikh on 4th April 1335,informing the Resident of his action* The British Authorities leave these ques tions of personnel to the will of the tribes concerned and usually do no more than recognise the individual whom the support and choice of the tribe puts in a position to handle the reins : &lt;3 of government; and in this case SMikh Sagar / received recognition in due course. As soon as he had made sure of his position he addressed the Resident (on 17th May 1335) saying that he now proposed to expel Shaikh Salim from Abu Musa. In reply he was reminded that the Residency had in former years specifically notified to the Trucial Chiefs that the principles of the Mari time Truce must be held to apply to the islands as well as the seas of the Persian Gulf and that he should consequently endeavour to arrange a peaceable settlement with his uncle. Simultaneously Shaikh Salim left Abu Musa for Lingah and thence wrote to the Resident asking his good offices. He in turn was advised to remain in Lingah (it being more convenient for purposes of communication) until he could come to an understanding with Shaikh Sagar. Being in the weaker position Salim soon cams to terms and a settlement guaranteed by the ohaikhs of Ras—el—Khaima and T 'ebai, was arrived at in July 1335 under which Shaikh Salim was to receive iireceive a pension of 600 dollars per annum for his maintenance. A copy of the settlement is attached. Shaikh Salim however found it difficult to refrain from intriguing against his nephew, in the hope, no doubt, of getting back the Shaikhdom. Thus, on 21st January 1334 Shaikh Sagar com plained to the Resident of his uncle’s conduct and in the course of his letter he wrote; 'At ' present you are aware that Salim resides on ' Bu Musa, which is an island dependent on Shar- ' gah. and I cannot spare it to others and per- ' haps Salim may create some disturbance which ,f may break the Maritime Peace. I beg therefore ' that you will kindly warn Salim and inform him ' that if he is desirous of living at Abu Musa ' he must do so peaceably, you being his guar- antee that nothing wrong will be done by him ' of a nature to disturb the Maritime Peace. But ' should he not choose to obey it will be your ' choice either to remove him from the island ' or to leave us to settle the matter between ' us and in that case we should not be called ' to account in the event of our attacking one 'Another. I leave the matter to your disposition.” In reply the Shaikh was informed that if either party broke tlie Maritime Peace he would be promptly repressed. About this time the Shaikhs of Ras-e1-Xhaima and T ‘ebai also complained to the Resident against Shaikh Salim's violation of the agreement, guar anteed as it had been by themselves. On 14th February following Shaikh Sagar again wrote to the Resident politely urging that it was all very well for him to say that whoever broke the Maritime Peace.would be repressed, but remindingreminding him hliat; Abu Musa was his. Shaikh Sa gan’s property - a hereditary appanage of Shar- gah. He added; ”If ASalim wants to live there and guarantees that he will not commit anything which would interfere with my affairs, or dis turb the Maritime Peace, so be it; but I cannot dispense with this island, which of the greatest use to me. I beg therefore that you will plain ly write to me on the subject and likewise ins truct your Agent.' On this letter was recorded an office note to the following effect: 'Shaikh Sagar seems to in sist that if Salim continues to live on Bu Musa he should give a guarantee through the Resident that he will not do anything to disturb him. Shaikh Sagar, or the Maritime Peace.' On 5th April Shaikh Sagar wrote the Resident another letter pressing for a reply to the above. He added that he had communicated his precise object in writing to the Residency Agent, who would explain it. This was that now that spring had arrived he wished to send his horses as usual for grazing and was not sure whether Shaikh Salim would leave them and their caretakers in peace. If the Resident would not allow him to make his own arrangements for ensuring safety of life and property on the island he wanted an assurance from the Residency that his stud would not be molested by Shaikh Salim. Shaikh Salim hoxvever who was now getting into financial straits solved the difficulty himself. He made an appeal to the Residency alleging that Shaikh Sagar and the guarantors of the Agreement of 133d had not stood by the terms of it; that they had taken away the state horses which as Shaikh of Shargah, he had with him on the island when his nephew ousted him from the Shaikhdom: thatthat he, Shaihh Salim had had to sell all he possessed to maintain himself and now had nothing left: and that he had now come to beg his nephew to provide him with the wherewithal for a bare living, ile declared that if he got this he would remain in peace and quietude. Finally he begged our Agent to intercede for him and to in duce Shaikh Sagar to act up to the Agreement. Ly the advice of the Residency Agent, Shaikh Sagar, who had found the 600 dollars somewhat too much his purse, consented to pay his uncle a reduced allowance of 400 dollars annually, half of which only was to be paid in cash and the other half in grain and other articles. He also promised to assign to Shaikh Salim the revenue of the Island of Sir Abu Nuair, which contained some salt deposits and was expected to bring in about 200 dollars more. A document in the above sense was drawn up t at a meeting at Ajman and there ratified. When reporting the conclusion of this Agreement the Residency Agent mentioned that Shaikh Salim was at present going on a visit to Ras-el-Xhaima and that his family would spend the hot weather there and the winter on Abu .Musa. Things went on smoothly after this for a time but the 2 Shaikhs eventually got at loggerheads again and in April 133 Q our Agent reported that Salim had endeavoured to raise an attack on Shargah. On getting wind of his uncle's intentions Shaikh Sagar,as usual, asked the advice of the British Agent and the latter soon succeeded in bringing about a friendly meeting between the two result ing in the framing of a third Agreement in super cession of the preceding ones. This was to the following effecti Shaikh Sagar bound himself to pay his now aged uncle the 400 dollar pension regularly and to permit him to return to the mainland of Oman and to live where he pleased within . «?/within certain limits. He also offered, to take Shaikh Salim into his service as Vazier or chief adviser and to consult him in all matters affect ing the interests of the state. Shaikh Salim in turn undertook to serve his nephew in obedience and loyalty. Ho mention was made of Sir Bu Huair in this Agreement because it had hitherto disappointed previous expectations and had not brought in anything. The above has held good and no further docu- ■ mentary agreement has since been necessary. On the conclusion of it Shaikh Salim came to live in Shargah as his nephew's adviser and for some pears past the two have been the best of friends; so much so that when Shaikh Sagar leaves his headquarters, which he not infrequently does, he always leaves his uncle to officiate in the government of Shargah, as he did,for instance, on his departure for the Mecca pilgrimage in 1397-1393* It was on return from the said pilgrimage in 1393 that his uncle informed him of the grant of the Abu Musa Oxide Concession; when, in view of the fact that since the reduction of his pension from 900 to 400 dollars Shaikh Salim 2iad always been complaining of the paucity of his income. Shaikh Sagar as an act of generosity decided to let his uncle enjoy the 250 dollars annual rent fixed for the Concession and thereby cease to have cause for further discontent. From first to last however Shaikh Sugar's ac quiescence in his uncle’s enjoyment of the pro produce and income of the island in question, has been purely a personal and verbal arrange ment which Shaikh Sagar might at any time have terminated.terminated had he ohosen to do so. No deed what ever, aocording to the statements of the two &gt;Shaikhs themselves, has ever 'been given hy Shaikh Sagar to his uncle in regard to this island, al though the island of Sir Abu Nuair did find men tion in the second Agreement as abovementioned, dropping out again in the third and last because it had never brought in any income. Stronger proof of the status of the island could hardly be wanted than the declarations furnished by the two Shaikhs themselves. i 23th February 1303. I gyl'Sie Agreement of 188^ between Sheikh Sagar and Sheikh Salim. NOTE. In replying uo the German Case it seems unnecessary for us in the ursu instance to go behind the 3rd agreement of 1889 which is still in operation, the others having lapsed. If, however, it is considered advisable for us to refer to this Agreement of 1883 in detail, it would seem prudent, in order to preclude misunderstanding, to give an explanation of the reference to Abu Musa island in the text of Sheikh Salim’s undertaking. Reaa by itself the terms of this document would perhaps enable the German Government to argue corroboration for the assertion made in their case to the effect that Sheikh Salim was the owner of the island and not Sheikh Sagar. In noint of fact the explanation of the reference is natural and simple. As stated in % my memorandum on the status of Abu Musa it had been the custom from time immemorial for the Sheikhs of Shargah to send their State and private horses and livestock over to graze on the island every spring; and at the time when Sheikh Sagar,seized the government from his uncle, it will be remembered that the latter was spending his yearly visit to the island and had a number of the State horses with him. After the coup d’etat the disposal of these horses became one of the chief difficulties in the way of a friendly settlement; but eventually Salim had to give them up. While therefore, in the interests of peace, acquiescing Hfx in Sheikh Salim’s taking up his residence on the island for the present Sheikh Sagar naturally did not wish to forego the conve nient practice of sending his stud ever to graze; on the other hand, for him to have sent them over without being able to take any adequate steps to ensure their safety would have been to put in Salim’s hands a simpleeffective means of annoying his nephew by interfering with the horses. Sheikh Sagar therefore got Salim to give him a written assurance that while he resided in Abu Musa Sheikh Sagar could send over his horses as usual with out apprehension.Sharka,li Agent. „iTo. 54 dated Id th, Pa.madan 19th July. 1500 1885 I’Qoeived a letter from.

I saw Sakar and understood that he wanted an arrangement. He asked me to guarantee the conditions but I refused.

On 13th July Sakar took the document of agree ment and left for Sharkah. It is understood that Salim will not concern himself about the other sons of Sultan bin Sakar.

After compliments. As you are aware on the 19th Muharram 1?£6 we decided to annul the deed of contract for the oxide contract of Abu Musa, which waa in the hands of Haji Hassan bin All Samaiyeh and hie partners and subsequently we expelled his workmen from the island. We now learn that Haji Hassan bih All Samaiyeh on 10th October 190V, that is to say after 8 months after the annulment of the con- cession &gt; sold a share in the oxide company v/hich had formerly belonged to Yusuf bin Abdulla. How could this person possibly sell a share in a concern which a long time since had been done away with wholly and entirely. And seeing that the procedure of Haji Hassan is against all principles and his motive is to create con fusion, it is necessary for me to inform you that I am unable to accept or agree to this action and in view of the fact that the buyer and sexier are dependents of the British Government, I re quest that you will take steps for the suppression of these object ionable proceedings. And whereas you have enquired of me the nature of Sheikh Salim's connection with Abu Musa, your honour must be fully aware oi the circumstances, namely that since the time of my assuming the Government of Shargah and its dependencies, I have left the income of the island of Abu Musa for the subsistence of my uncle Sheikh Salim so long as he remains steadfast in his loyalty to and concord with myself; and his sojourn there has'been with my acquiescence and at my will, and my honoured uncle Sheikh Salim in no wise denies this, and as you will see from his letter to me in which he details the true facts of the position in which we are placed towards each other in this connection. For youfinformation T send you Sheikh Salim's letter in original. Furthermore I have recorded in a note the nature of the position in regard to Abu Musa in j- ■K X ?rX &amp; * m. in detail from beginning to end bo that you may be aware of it This is what had to be explained.

In reference to the Island of Abu Musa, it is well known to every body that it is the property of the Sheikhs of the Jowasim of Oman and on that point there is no doubt. As-to the residence of my unc..e in it the facts of the matter are as explained below. From olden days, from the time of my ancestors Sheikh Sultan an^ others, it was their habit in the days of spring after a fall of rain and the sprouting of vegetation to send their livestock to the island of Abu Musa for grazing, and also a number of our subjects from Shargah and Khan habitually sojourned on the island during the winter for fishing purposes and had houses and huts there. In the year 1300 Hijri Sheikh Salim who was then Ruling Chief of Shargah after sending his livestock there as usual went over to the island and by the fate ordained by God the populace called upon me to become their ruler in place of Sheikh Salim, and I accepted their call and occupied the post of the Sheikhdom. It was then open to me to expel Sheikh Salim Brom Abu Musa Island and I addressed the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject in letters which must be available on your records; the first was dated 22nd Rabi-ul-Awal 1301 and the second 14th Rabi II 1301 but the Redident pressed me to make a peaceable settlement so that there might be no cause for a breach of the maritime peace. Ac cordingly we agreed that I would set apart for Sheikh Salim a pension for his sufesistance, every year 000 dollars. That settle ment afterwards became void by my not being able to pay the amount fixed, and subsequently, a second agreement was come to between us under which I was to pay him yearly 400 dollars and also the income derived from the Island of Sir Abu Nuair which was expected to approach 200 dollars. This agreement also became void and in the year 1306 we made a third agreement with Sheikh Salim by the mediation of the Government Agent, and in view of the fact that up to this agreement no income had beefa obtainable from Sir Abu Nuair for Sheikh Salim, mention of the island was omitted and his pension remaineddollars, but I now remained at the previous figure of 400 agreed to the return of Sheikh ov -neiuai Salim to Shargah and I took him into my service. Then later on in the year 1315 I went on the Mecca pilgrimage and appointed Sheikh Salim to act for me in the Shargah Government and on my return Sheikh Salim informed me that he had been afforded an opportunity and had 8een it to our interest to lease the mines of Abu Musa to three persons subject to the British Government. I did not repudiate it and saw nothing objectionable in it and so I acquiesced in it; and seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not suffi cient for his subsistence, I voluntarily set aside the amount of this rent for him, that it. might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in i± to him yearly might be 600 dollars as before, and over, and that no cause of soreness might be left -ccount of the paucity ol his allowance. I have a.bsolutely not. given hini any deed in connection with, the island nor in regard to the mines therein; all I did was to relinquish the income to him, in the way’/of financial assistance from me to him - and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion. And I have not ceased in the days of spring in years when there has been rain and herbage to send my livestock to the island for grazing purposes as has been our custom from of old; and my flag ceases not to fly there. Such are the facts of the matter and I have recorded them for your information. signature and seal of Sheikh Sagar bln Khalid bin Sultan.Prom Salim bin Sultan. To Sheikh Sagar bin Khaled, Sheikfe of Shargah. After complimente. I write to inform your honour that whereae I have come to know that Haji Hassan bin All Samaiyeh and the friends who advise him assert that the oxide mines which are in the island of Abu Musa are my personal property and that the lease which was issued by me to Haji Rassan and his partners was given by me in my own right and not by proxy in your behalf; I fear that this statement may become a cause of ill-feeling between us, I have oheretore thought it necessary to apprise your honour of it and to acquaint you with what is in my mind, namely that I absolutely made no such claim as that which interested parties allege; and I hereby admit that when I came before you in the presence of the British Agent on 4th Shaaban 1301 I had no pension or means of subsistence and you were kind enough to place the island of Abu Musa under my supervision so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence and you did so conditionally that I showdd 7 loyalty and concord and obedience to you in all respects; and I am well aware that the island in question and the mines which are in it belong to your h6nour and that you might at any time aofcgfcat decide to take the island ffom my charge, it is at your disposition to do so, and I have no status or power to gainsay you. And when I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was offi- for ciating on your behalf and the concession was given by proxy *38*:^ you and I was well aware that on your return from the pilgrims-ge to Mecca, if you considered that my action in the matter of the concession was good, you would confirm what 'I had agreed to, and if in your opinion it was objectionable you could annul it. either at the time or at any other time; and I altogether disapprove of the proceedings of Kaji Hassan bin All Samaiyeh in regard to this lease and in respect of whatever action you took in this connect ion, that is in^; cancelling the document, I was acting in accord with you, seeing that your action was taken in consul.tation with me% me and for the Interests of U0 all; and In'respect have I any view contrary to yours, and it is in order to dispel doubt from your mind and as an evidence of my singleness.of view with you that I have written this so that you may have cognizance.

T hen my grand uncle Shaikh Saeed bin nadtheeb died his son Shaikh Itttaleefeh was very young, and therefore my father ohaikh Ahaled bin Sultan assumed the govern ment of the place, at the same time he married the mother of Shaikh Zhaleefah, and when the latter be came of age he handed over the authority to him; and there was no difference between them either personal ly or as regards the properties etc. it is Quite plain that the islands of Sirri, Eu musa, fumb and Sir Eu Nfa'air, all are dependencies of the Kawasemees of Oman. r hen hostility broke out between the Xawasem and the Lehi r as, the Chief of Aboothabee wanted to plunder the cattle which the Zawasemees used to send to Sirri ct*u for grazing anc^this the Ifawasemees of Oman sent some armed men to protect tixe island. After the death of Shaikh Ahaleefeh, ShaikhAli became the ruler of Lin gah - and the various dependencies continued as be fore without any alteration; and the properties of our &gt; ' v fore-fathers were inherited by their heirs and des cendants who up to this day secure the proceeds and profits of their properties. After the death of Shaikh Ali, Shaikh Yusuff became the ruler of Lingah a hd retained all the former relations, so much so that whenever there was any dispute between any of the Itawasemee Chiefs and the other Chiefs of Oman // thethe matter used to be taken up by the Lingah Chief who used to break off all oornmunioation with the hos tile Oman chief* 'lien Shaikh Kadtheeb became the ruler of Ling all, there occurred no alteration in the xormer relations in so far tha/t we have been related by descent with the above enumerated Chiefs. Then the violence of the Persians was experienced through the aggression of the Malek-et-TojJar and they set up their flag at Sirri, and things became altered, we could not bear to remain quiet; and in so fa,r we have A entered into agreement with the British (Government to maintain the maritime peace and general security for all, we do not like to so anything except after reference of the matter to the British (Government; and we have submitted the matter to the British (Government and we hope due remedy will be done; and that full endeavours will be made to remove those aggressions. We have good hopes in them. E. IIi-TOin. Shaikh Sagar bin nhalid Chief of Shargah.

No agreement between us and ITakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh took place and no document in writing was executed upon that subject. Tith 0 regard to Abu Musa my uncle Shaikh Salim bin Sultan cultivates in that island and in the year in which I went on the ilajj my aforesaid uncle was acting as my regent (kaim muqam) in Shargah and he saw fit to lease the mines of Abu Musa to Hassan bin Samaiyeh a British subject and Abdalla bin iiassan and Esa bin Abdul Latif and the lease has remained up to now. I think your Agent Abdul Latif must have informed you about it. This is what had to be written.Note,from Resldeacy Records, tending to demonstrate that Shaikh Salim when he ceased to be Chief of Shargah ceased to hold jurisdiction anywhere* In 133o the Towasim Shaikh of Lingah who at the mme had come to be regarded as Deputy Governor on behalf of the Persian Government asked Shaikh Salim who was then living in enile at Afeu Musa to entradite a negro of Sirrl Island who had taken refuge at Abu Musa. • ohailth. oalinx inquired from the .Residency as to what answer he should send. Colonel Ross directed . the Residency Agent to 'advise Shaikh Salim to inform the deputy Governor of Lingah that he (Shaikh Salim) is not in a position to enercise authority in such a matter*' In his letter Ke-rhtS of 11th February 1333 to the Government of India reporting the incident Colonel Ross wrote ; Shaiith. Salim bin Sultan to whom the Persian depart ment addressed x x ^ ^ no right to exercise jurisdiction anyrvhere* ” O/J Again in August 1334' after being ousted from the he Shaihhdom A wrote to the Resident that the headman of lujairah had plundered some dependants of Shargah on the j^att-inah and Gharaifa appanages of the Shargah princi pality on the Oman Coast and ashed the Resident to take action. It was noted on this reference; Shaikh Salim is now no longer Chief of Shargah and the agreement which Hamad bin Abdallah made with 'was A ah a time when he was ruling Chief of Shargah. conse- 'quently the agreement has no force and validity in it ‘'now.Eattinah Fujairah and Gharaifa are dependencies of the ruling Chief of Shargah and they dO' not concern w Salim in any way.

This was done and Hassan Samaiyeh likewise received a caution from Abdul Latif the Residency Agent and his son,vide hassan Samaiyeh/s letter of January 30th 1905, in which he flouted the idee, of his ever letting the ' 0t l905? Uary German get a footing. Nothing of importance was heard of the matter until reports of some objectionable compact between Samaiyeh and Wohokajhus reached the Resident in August 1906, and on investigation it appeared that there was evidently truth in the report in question and that Hassan Samaiyeh was endeavouring to throw dust in the eyes of Esa and hie father and to keep the precise terms of the deed of contract secret from them. Thus on 7th June he had written to Mr. Tigrane 7th June 1906. Malcolm of Bushire who claims to have a subsidiary shar^in the concern; and on 11th June to Abdul Latif, telling them of his deal with Wonckhaue, but not mentioning the existence of any formal deed and glazing 11th June x, 1906. over the fact that an abdolute monopoly of purchase had been granted to the German Firm. In the German Case the letter is conspicuous by its absence from the enclosures. Abdul Latif our Native Agent on the Trucial Coast TTui j after, warnings which he had given to Hassan, not suspect ing Hassan’s good faith and attracted no doubt by the prospectIITmilliJWHflJl prospect of reaping profit from a concern from which during ten years past his son had derived no benefit, did not appreciate the real significance of Hasean's naive remark that 'if more was extracted Wonckhaus would be a taker of it', and in the absence of the text of A the document was misled into expressing his satisfaction. He clearly did so however on the supposition that no lease or formal deed had been executed,for in intimating his provisional approval he repeated his former caution in this regard* In reply Hassan pooh-poohed his apprehensions and assured him that there had been nothing more than a simple sale of oxide. 14th June 1906. ( 5th July 1906. It was now.that Hassan began a series of lies in tended to facilitate concealment of the text of the contract with Wonckhaus as long as possible. Thus when asked by Mr. Malcolm for a copy of the agreement he re plied that it was in German and that he could get no one to copy It. This letter was forwarded to the Resident 23rd August 1906. 27th August 1906. 14th October 1906. at the end of October called at Shargah and ascertained that a copy was still not forthcoming, but having regard to the purport of the letter from Hassan to Abdul Latif dated I1th June which was now shown to the Resident E*a was advised to write and repudiate,the contract. 7th November 1906. On 2nd November the hingah Agent forwarded a copy obtained after a good deal of pressure. It was found to by Mr• Malcolm of Bushire who had mentioned the matter in conversation a few days before. Recourse was then had to the Residency Agent Shargah but nothing resulted for some time. Meanwhile Mr. Malcolm heard again from Hassan who now excused himself from sending a copy on the,grounds that the 'German” /-'v, had enj oined secrec y upon h im . ''^The Residency Agent Shargah wrote two or three times for a copy, meanwhile the Resident being on tour 7,rto be in English and not German a B pretended by Haaaan &lt;md the terms of it were in parts open to objection. 8 nd November A few days after giving this copy to our Lingah 1906 ‘ Agent, Hassan wrote to Abdul Latif and put him off with the obviously false statement that the deed bad 8. half with Abdul Latif however continued to press for it and at iast on 16th Deoember Haesan sent a copy to him. on getting it, or soon after, Abdul Latif wrote on behalf of his son and objected to the terms of it. Meanwhile authority was received by the Resident from the Government of India to discuss the question with the Sheikh of Shargah, and in the result the latter addressed Hassan a communication intimating the hull!ftcation of the Concession, Esa bin Abdul Latif protesting against Hassan’s conduct simultaneous ly. In spj t© of the evidence to the contrary forthcoBiing in his previous letters, Hassan Samaiyeh now began to pretend that he had sent Abdul Latif a copy of the dedd when first asked, and that the latter had agreed after seeing it. He also complained to the Residency in an un dated letter received 12th March 1907 making the same allegation namely that he had sent Abdul Latif the terms of the Agreement in English and Arabic in the first instance and that it had been agreed to by Esa and his father. This appears to be absolutely untrue. See Hassan*s letter of 31th June #o Abdul Latif and subsequent cor respondence showing that he intentionally kept the terms secret. It is to be noted that the letter of Abdul Latif to Hassan dated 27th March 1907 is the same as enclosure 10 in the German Case, but there is some divergence in our translation. The two letters dated 50th March 1907, but unsignedi « unsigned though apparently from Eassan to Abdul Latif and the Sheikh of Shargah call for no special remark. 3 ^ 7 “ arM * From the above papers it will be seen that whereas the Residency Agent at Lingah was vigilant and astute throughout in connection with the conduct of this Concession, the behaviour of our Shargah Agent was not altogether free from blame. »he truth was, I think, that he is not a man of business, ana did not at first realise the serious possibilities of Hassan Samaiyeh’s relations with the German Firm. copy He ae a rule takes a press A of private letters issued by him, bfct on his going through his books with me it was found that one or two items wanted could not be traced; either copies were not taken or the press copy is so faint as to he unidentifiable. Since he realised the way ih which he had been deceived by Hassan Samaiyeh he has been quite frank with me and gives me his solemn word that he fears nothing that Hassan Samaiyeh can produce either in his own writing or his son f s, and that we need not feac ibhat any letter of his of which an office copy is not forthcoming contains anything more than appears in letters hitherto produced.

We could not allow this sort of interference from anyone especially on the part .of these persons. You may rest assured.

I beg to say that I have made an agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus that he should buy red oxide from the Island of Abu Musa* I settled with him that he should ship 2000 tons every year from the island and I settled the price with him at 15 shillings per ton; and a commission is to be charged thereon. We have to deliver the oxide on board the steamers and Mr. Wonokhaue should pay boat-hire at 10 annas per ton. (Other) expenses are to be borne by us. If God pleases, it will prove to be prosperous. I have conclud ed an agreement with him for a period of 4 years. Should we be able to obtain more than 2000 tons red oxide, he will take it. Th^ work will begin from 1st June 1906. This is a fortune which God has destined to us. If God pleases, this work will go on regularly. And it ie arranged that when we receive a telegram from them advising that a steamer comes to ship red oxide, they should then pay us one half of the price of what is to be shipped by the steamer. The remaining half should be paid when the steamer finishes shipping the consignment. It has been arranged that we can ship afterwards the 6000 bags 500 tons which we have contracted to ship to India. I have £aken from them an advance of Rupees 2000. I hope this affair will pass on easily.

Praise be to God, this is a god-send and will make up for the past. The arrangement will continue for 4 years, and I have taken from him an advance of Rupees 2000. He has made conditions with us for the shipment of 200 or 150 tons per diem. The work begins from the let June 1906 and I have written to my son Abdulla to settle his affairs (in India) at any rate and to come and supervise the work. I have sent labourers to the is land and we shall have in any case to buy more donkeys for trans portation. I hope that once begun the work will go on regularly.\ ^ a ted gist Ra,bl II 152 4 14th June 1906. From Abdul Latif Skargah. To Baji Hassan hitt All Someiyeh IJ-ngaii A.

As to your remarks on the subject of the red oxide in regard to which God decreed that you sold it to the German Wonckhaus at 15 shillings per ton, and whereas it was arranged that you should excavate 2000 tons per annum, all the charges to be defrayed by you and he to receive the oxide nett. Very good; I hope it is auspicious. It will be good fortime after trouble. In mny case our brother Abdullah must reach there to supervise the wor$, because I think the operations cannot be regulated without him. Please, however, refrain ffcom entering upon any arrangements whatever in the nature of leases or deeds of contract from which there will arise difficulties and quarrels which will lead to complaints and claims, because this will be difficult for our over-lords and they will not consent to it; and you are by God*s grace wise and will not commit any negligence or hesitatioh likely to entangle you, because in these days everyone is making a trap with which to catch people. I hope you will not be neglect ful in this regard.

In particular regarding the receipt by you of my letter and your comprehension of its purport with reference to our transaction with the German. Insh Allah it will turn out well. You told me to take care that he did not get any bond from me (which would enable him) to enjer the island. Set your mind at rest, I, your brother am knowledgabls and well versed in matter* ofbusiness and am far from acting in such a way as you indicate. He has not the presumption to make overtures to me in that direction. For, just as I told you.he is only a purchaser of the oxide itself, nothing more. Whether it be he or someone else 5 whoever wants to buy the oxide from me, if the price suits me I shall sell it. Do not let any idea bsyond .this enter your head.

I have received your esteemed letter dated 56th June and perused it gladly and understood what you had stated. Ya** had acknowledged receipt of my letter the contonts of which you had understood. A© regards the sale to the German, it is satisfactory and I hope it will be fortunate. You had understood the details regarding the sale, shipment and boat-hire, but you did not let me know about the commission; is it to be charged by us from them or by them from us? You had written that I should send you a copy of the agreement. Very well, but the agreement has been written in German and there is no one with us who oan writ® such a hand. The purport of the agreement is accurately the same as I have written to you. You had written to me whether we have contracted with the \ German for 2000 tons per annum. Yes, we have contracted with him that the quantity should be 2900 tons at least, and he can, ac cording to the agreement take any more quantities which we may be able to obtain from the mines. You had written whether we oan obtain more than this quantity and if so, whether we can contract with ot&amp;er Europeans, so that you may negotiate with them. I have understood this; but I cannot give the accurate quantity unless the mine is worked for 2 or 3 months when I will be able to form an idea. I despatched 45 workmen to the island in the beginning of June, but little work is done it being summer and the days being hot. If more than 2000 tons are obtained, the German is bound to take it from us. We can therefore make no ot&amp;er contract. I beg also to inform you $hat my son Abdulla has sold about at Calcutta. Only the freight is to be paid by 400 tons more or lesst by us, every maund will be Ro 1/9 delivery at Calcutta. I have been ^trying to procure a vessel since a long time. I have now-a- days chartered 'Alimghlr^ the vessel belonging to the sons of Khoja (to ship red oxide) at Rupees 10 per ton. It is now several days that she has gone to the island to shlip (the oxide). Thank God my son Abdulla has freed himself from the dispute at Calcutta, He has compromised with them. He has oorae to Bombay and I will receive his lotter from Bombay by this mail, if God pleases. I hope he will not be detained there and that he will settle his case with Jeita Bania and come to our parts soon.J}ote by Resident. Up to this point, I had received no report of this contract with Wonckhaua from the Residency Agent at Shargah. It was not unuil some little time after m^/return to headquarters on 27tht July 1906, after a visit to Simla,that Mr. Malcolm the British protected Armenian Merchant of Bushire mentioned the matter in a somewhat exaggerated form in the course of a private^to the Residency.

He promised to try and get authentic details, but not hearing from him for a few days I wrote to him privately on the subject as below:- Gop^y uf- a private latter from Major Oox to Mr. Tigrane Malcolm Armenian British protected merchant of Bushire.

Also, where is it that you have an interest in this matter? Your name is not on the original document of the concess ion from Shargah is it?

In the first of these you had informed me that Sheikh Sagar and Sheikh Salim have given you an assurance that they would not enter’-into any negociations without consulting the Resident, with any foreigner for the lease of the red oxide deposits on Abu Musa Island; and in the second letter you reported that you had impressed on the con cessionaires, your son Esa and Hassan Samaiyeh that they likewise should not enter into partnership with foreign merchants in con- neotion with this concession. I have lately received information that Herr Wonckhaus has entered into some arrangement with the concessionaires for all the ' produce of the red oxide deposits of Abu Musa for a term of years.

He will settle his account and will leave for our parts in 2 or T|- months. You had remarked that you had asked some &amp;ie in the post office to take from me a copy of the document which is in German. Let it not be hidden from you that the German when the bargain was concluded with him saial to me that this transaction be kept secret (YEK00N MAST00R) and so I did not wish that any outsider should com© to know of it and I fear that if news of the copying of the document reaches his ears he will be annoyed.

I then ascertained that they had not yet received a copy but they showed me the letter from Hassan dated 11th June and on seeing it I advised Ssa bin Abdul Latif to write and repudiate the Contract. On my return to headquartero on 19th November I found that a copy had sine© been received from the Residency Agent at Lingah.,4 From No. &lt;54-3 dated 2nd Novembor 1906 (14th Ramazan) The Residency Agent, Lingah. To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. A.C. With reference to your letterdated 6th October 1006, I beg to state that in conformity with your orders I took the necessary steps in the matter and asked Hasean bin All Someiyah to show me the original agreement which he had entered into with the German Mr. Wonekhaus, in connection with the red oxide mines in Abu Musa island. He refused at first saying 'it had been arranged that no one should come to know of this trans action except those who are partners (to the first lease) and I reported it to the Residency Agent at Shargah because his soh Esa was one of the partners. I will, however, show you a copy of the agreement'. Somehow or other I persuaded him and he produced to me the original agreement which bore hi© own seal and signature and tne signature of Mr. lf\onc§:haus and which was written in English in the hand-writing of Mr. Garsten late Manager of the German Firm. After examining it, I requester him to let me have the loan Co. the original version, but he did not agree. I, however, got him to agree to give a copy of the contract and in company with him Jsook the document in question to the British Postmaster who td&gt;ok a certified copy thereof and attested it. Hassan then took back the original document and I beg to submit its copy herewith. It appears froa Hassan bin Ali Someiyeh’s remarks that there is with Mr. Wonckhaus a similar document under the signatures of Hassan and Wonckhaus himself. Hassan stated likewise that he has no right to give (any quantity of red oxide) to others as long as Mr. Wonckhaus wishes to have it. He further stated that h© has purchased the Chief of Shargab^s share and that he holds a writing (to that effect) from the Chief. I wanted to ask him gor the A/the document in W hich he has purchased the Chief of Shargah's share, but thinking that he would form a misapprehension, I did not do so pending receipt of your instructions. According to his own statement Hassan has hitherto received an advance of Rupee b 6000 from the firs of Wonokhaus. These are true facts of the case, and I report them for your Information. In my sjuatxxx opinion, and if you think it advisable .arrange- ments should be made for the abolition of the lease of Abu Musa Island altogether. It would be better if the island is not leased /fiZNOTE. () It siioald b« noted that whereaa Haasan Samaiyeh had the original deed of contract a day or so before 2nd of November on which day the Residency Agent at Lingah posted it to me (the fatter stating that he sent indirectly he got it without missing a mail) yet on 11th November he, Hassan, (in the letter next following) wrote to Abdul Latif that_he had,, f9rward^d_t he document a month aco to hi a son Abdulla in Jombay. As ne wra aware that I had by now got a copy tnis lie was priraa facie unnecessary,' but the explanation probably is that he knew that objection would come from Esa and wanted tc a* delay it as long as possible, on the supposition that the longer the delay the more difficult it would be for his agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus to be upset.bated 25nd Ram azan 1324 . ^ Hth November 1908.

I have understood the copy of* the e-freement concluded by you with the German for the sale of the Abu Musa red oxide. My son Esa does not agree to the execution of an agreement to this effect and you had neither sajssratkiiot consulted with, nor referred to him, nor did you send him a copy of the agreement before the settlement with the German of the affair concerning the red oxide so that views might be exchanged between you both and that you might adopt a recognised, obvious and evident course hJEEuasx because it is obligatory for the partners not to undertake a matter except after a general consensus of views, so that no difficulties may occur and you have undertaken this affair without any consultation. Therefore, my son, Ssa does not agree to the agreement con cluded between you and the German because he fears difficulty will result from foreigners concerning themselves in the matter. The nullification of this agreement is better thah its acceptance. You had previously received a letter jifrom me) saying that you should not involve yourself into difficulties with the German in regard the red oxide because he (Bsa) fears an untoward result.

After compliments. I have to communicate with your honour with reference to the lease which I and two partners acquired from the government of bhargah relating to the extraction of Red Oxide from your Island of Abu Musa. As your honour is aware the document of lease was drawn up in the names of 3 persons namely your humble servant Esa bin Abdul Latif, Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh and Abdulla bin Hassan Samaiyeh. I have come to know that on 1st June 1906 (8th Rabi-ul-Thani 1324) the said Haji Hassan entered into a contract with a European merchant named Wonckhaus, without consulting me, and that according to the terms of the document he bound himself and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the Red oxide for a period of 4 years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this Agreement and bound himself without consulting me previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract dor you to examine; kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps ior the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether * unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I ha’v® written to Haji Hassan Samaiyeh expressing my disagreement to this coh- tract, but he has sent me no answer. Finally I am obliged to call your attention to the deed o£ contract in the beginning of which begins as follows; 'Contract between Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh of lingah ownerjana, holder, of the Abu Musa Concession, and Mr. Robert Wonckhaus of Lingah' . Now Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me giving him any general power in regard to action which he might take respecting the lease etc.,; how then has Haji Hassan the right thus to mention himself only without consulting or referring ko his1 his partners of whom I am one. I am In consequence obliged to make a complaint on the subject to your honour, and it is for your honour to issue orders.Translation of a latter dated 9th Moharrem 1325 (21st February Xf W07) from Sheikh Sagar bin Khalid Chief of Shargah to Haji Haesan bin All Samaiyeh* After Compliraents, I have to iniorm you that Eaa bin Abdul Latif has preferred a complaint to me in connection with the Red Oxide Mines on Abu Musa, which a.or some years have been leased in the names of your— self and hsa bin fiodul ~iatif and your con Abdulla, according to the deed executed on 18th Ziliaideh 15*5 (Slst April 1899). He has sent me a copy of the deed of contract in operation between you and Mr. Wonckhaus and complains that you executed this con tract without consulting him and that he does not agree to the conditions written in the contract now that he has come to know them. I too do not agree to this contract at all, and as for you, you had no right to give a contract in this fashion and bind yoursfelf to give away possession of the whole output of Red Oxide Mines to others, for a long period and without consulting us or making the slightest reference to us. And according to our view harm will accrue to us from the continuance of this concession in your hands in connection with Abu Musa; and your conduct in the present case is a violation of your duty towards us. Accordingly it appears to us advisable to withdraw the do cument of Concession from you, and we now inform you accordingly by this letter, so that you may realise that the contract between * us has terminated.

I understood it all. Oh my brother, at the time I executed the deed of agreement I communicated to you the details of it , copied in Arabic / alongside the English without addition or omission, and you came to know of it and approved it and wrote to me in reply that it was all right.

When your communication reached me saying that you had sold to the German before mentioned oxide from Abu Musa, every year 2000 tons of oxide at 15 shillings per ton, I sent you back an answer dated 21st Rabi TT 1524 which purported to convey acquiescence, but in the course of the same letter I cautioned you against entering into any agreement in x the nature of a leasehold or into any reaction likely to result in dispute, on the grounds that the overlords of our affairs would not agree to it. I asked you to give us immunity against the complications of the world (time). My letter in question is no doubt with you. Since writing it I have never received from you the copy of the deed of agreement existing b etween twg you and the German until 5th Zilkaadeh 1524 when it came in English after I had asked you for it time after time. T mentioned its arrival to you in my letter of 6th Zilkaadeh 1524 . And when we got a translator and translated the English document, it became plain to us that you had launched yourself into the very thing against which we had cautioned you and had tied j^ourself up by giving a lease. Consequently my son Esa does not agree to this document which doss not leave you any power of control or modiii- cation in regard to the oxide mines of Abu Musw. And previous to this present communication I communicated to you in my letter dated 8th Zilhi^jeh a translation of the deed for your information and said that you would perceive that the question was not one o-l mere/J.O mere sale as stated by you, but one of leasehold, against which T had warned you. Moreover Sheikh Sagar does not agree to the lease of the oxide to outsiders from foreign powers and claims that the agreement (with him) was that you should do the work yourselves and not farm it out.

SL J W.^U Your esteemed letter dated this month has been received and your friend has understood its contents especially your remarks 3n regard to my contract with the German to the effect that it is not a question of the sale of the red oxide only as I had informed you previously. My brother, what is preyed to me is this that it is really only (for) the sale of the red oxide but for a specified period a certain quantity every year until the expiration cf the period. It is not a lease of the island. Deeds of contracts and conditions for sales are always (made) on these lines. Re agreed to take a certain quantity from me every year and I agreed to ex cavate the oxide from the mines and to deliver it to him as long as there exists' red oxide in the same qimlit 3 r as before. Every person when he sells anything must necessarily take out a deed of sale and this is not a lease once for all. You know that I will not be entrapped either by the German or others but perhaps you are being forced to dispute about this: for the rest the German has bought some red oxide and nothing else^from the lease holders of the mines at Abu Musa island; Hassan bin Ali &amp; Co. Even were we to convey the exxkxxx oxide for him to lingah - the expenses thereof being paid by us - he would have no objec-- r tion 9 neither would he have anything to say about the island or the possession of it. Notwithstanding this, when I received letters from you on this subject (saying) that surely the con tract could be nullified, I communicated with him regarding the nullification of tlje same. He replied 'if you suggest any inter ference in the island, I (the German) will write a document for you(to the effect) that I have no concern in the leas© of the islandrr island . I have simply bought ©xide from the lease holders of thcr mines on the island of Abu Musa for a specified period in the same ^ay as others buy from you. T have been in dealings with all the merchants o£ the Persian and Arab Coa&amp;ts and there has not been .he least confusion in our intercourse with the peoplej c.nd i... you are not sat/isfieo with the writing and wish nothing but the nullification of this contract all right, but please pay me 15 shillings per ton according to the contract and also the money I paid for expenses. If you pay me the money, I will no longer require the agreement and will relinquish it. Otherwise it is not possible for me to abandon my rights. We are not sitting here to play games in business matters. We act in accordance with rules”. f 3,ow. t if you think it advisable write him a letter and give him explanations regarding the nullification of the contract. Perhaps &amp;o will agree, otherwise, as far as I can ^udge, I have not the power to depart from what has passed in the way of con ditions of sale except after the expiry of the period according to the deed of agreement. And you are the wisest of the learned. It is proved to you that I did not do (this) until I was satis fied that you would approve of this transaction. You had better drop discussion about this becuase the road is closed (to any discussion). If the German says he will write you a letter according to your desire saying that he has no concern in the island or in the mines on the island and that he has only purchased from the lease-holders of the Island, Hassan bln All &amp; Co the red oxide which is being excavated from the mines on the island, he has left no grounds for further argumentand you are aware that a wholetalc transaction cannot be cbtaifaed at all times; and that w© have spent considerable sums over tnis since we leased th* this mine up to the present. Which of the partners paid me a single cent and wh© would have paic up my claim if I had not scld(the stuff)? You are aware that the sale is a matteroof luck and whenever such is achieved tue burden fxkixa: falls from the necks of all the partners; but if itMUMit ispiet achieved then all the partners are necessarily a.^swera^le - or the expenses when the accounts are made up, When my son Abdulla arrives from Bombay, I will settle the accounts of the Island, and you will understand everything in its proper state. Give salaams to your sons Esa and brothers. (Unsigned).Copy of an unsigned letter from Ha ssan bin All Samaiy to Sheikh Sagar bin Khalld. Dated 15th Safe r- 1S8 5 . 30 th March 1907. A.C. Your esteemed letter dated the current month has be received and what you had stated was understood by your friend, especially (your remark) that although^one paragraph of a letter, Abdul Latif did consent to the German’s contract there was neverthe less in the same letter a warning regarding any lease etc., which may lead to any obligation. Yes, I did not act contrary to that warning, and the German has no concern in the lease or anything else in the. island. Only the oxide has been sold to him. Therefore on the day that my brother Abdul Latif received an answer to the letter of warning it was proved to him that I had not acted in-a contrary way. It is only the sale of the red oxide and nothing else; and 1 am not bound by the German except for the sale of oxide. But, as regards what you have stated that I had written that I was the owner of the island; how can I take possession of the island? I have but leased from Sheikh Salem bin Sultan the mines which are on th© island of Abu Mlusa and I am paying Sheikh oalem a certain rental every year as per the agreement. As to what you had stated that I had written that I was in charge and possess ion (of the mines) and that the sales were (left) in my control, tufre, it is obvious to the partners that since the leas©(firas exe cuted), it was I who undertook possession, sale, expenditure and the needs - according to rule. And from the time of (the execution of) the lease up to now, it was I who undertook everything and all expenses and worked up to now, and none of the partners opposed me in this affair, and they have no right to do so. Who was it that paid me a single cent on account of the expenses I incurred over this oxide so that he may raise objections against me? (They can do so only) when they find any irregularity (on my part). As you say I am a dependant of the British Government and shall not behave except according to rules; and it ws^s not desirab le for you to make this objection without any fault (on my part)Iv &gt;-V i or any reason. You are aware that tv,* Pr 6 ^ at the Ge ^an has no concern; he has only bought the red oxid® r^nn- ° irom me for a specified period, and it is not hidden that we nave spent a large am over thosa minea and if we procure no sale, wherefro, can we obtain ( money ) equal ’ to what we have talren from the German and others 7 .

On our acquisition of the lease we gave a share to Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh. Subsequently on the return of sheikh Sagar from the Mecca pilgrimage, he too asked us to give him a share in the concern, and we gave him one on 1st Rabi II m 6 . Then the Company consisted of 5 shares, all equal, six months later in the month of Ramazan my cousin Yusuf bin Abdulla asked ■ Sheikh Sagar to sell his share to him, and as Sheikh Sagar had received no proceeds from the ozide he sold his share to Yusuf. Yusuf's partnership continued for about S years. After that Yusuf not receiving any profits from this share during the past 2 years Rcld nis snare to Raji Hassan Samaiyeh, so it resulted that there were now 2 shares in Kaji Hassan's name, one in that cf his son Abdulla, 0 * 1 '=' in Makhoda All's name and one in my own; and the rights of us were similar in proportion of our shares. From time to i-ime 1 paid to Sheikh Salem my share of the yearly rent, and similarly l contributed a portion of the expenses incurred. 1 ln nowis * S ave any power of attorney to Haji Hassan which would warrant his acting Just as he pleased without con- suxting me in operations connected with the concession. On the contrary it was incumbent upon him to act in regard to every transaction in communication with me according as was agreed in the deed which was drawn up between us and Haji Ali Ahmed Saleh: and from the time of the commencement of the lease up to the date of his contract with Mr. Wonckhaus the German, Haji Kassan from time to time had shipped Oxide to Calcutta and Bombay and else where, without informing us as he was under obligation to do according to the agreement. If however we heard of any shipment, ' we used to enquire from him and then he would inform us.m Ana the details of hi, shipments according to what we have heard from him or from others i B r6cor(3( „ in QUr bookB ^ approximately to 8000 tons. On every occasion on which we ashed him for an adjustment of the accounts he has put ue off with pro mises of adjustment, it was my father who was in the habit of corresponding with him on my behalf. On leth Rabl II 1SS4 Haji Eassan intimated to my father his transaction with Mr. Wonckhaus the German, but he neither forwarded any document in original nor a copy thereof; nor did he ever mention at all the execution of any written contract in this regard. He simply mentioned to my father that he was aeiling to Mr. Wonckhaue 2000 tons yearly and that if more was available Wonckhaus would take it. Several times my father specifically wrote to Haji Hassan cautioning him against the giving oi any bond or written agreement to outsiders. In reply he (Hassan) invariably gave assurance that he would not enter into any engagement except the sale of oxide to whosoever would purchase it; and when we learnt that he had executed a deed of contract in connection with this transaction, we made objections to him in rogaru to it and demsnddd from hima copy of the deed of contract and repeated the demand several times before he sent it to us. It was written in English, and when we perused a translation of it into Arabic we saw that it was objectionable. At once I refused to acquiesce in it and intimated to him my non-acceptance or this document and also complained to Sheikh Sagar regard thereto A\ - • ^ot»e by Resident regarding Enclosure ( 2 )- 0 f German Case i.e.tlie partnership of ifakhoda All in the Concession and his. rights under the same* ■ l •. i X am unable to understand why the German Govern ment ha/e included in their case the mention of iTakho- da Ali and the deed giving him a share in the concern* It is not a part of the original agreement although concluded very soon afterwards and if the document had not found mention in the German Case it would appear to have been difficult for us to have introduced it. Their doing so seems to place in our hands an import ant instrument in favour of our own case. The circumstances attending the connection of Ilakhoda Ali with the concern are briefly as follows: xhe said takhoda was formerly Cargo Landing Con tractor at Bushire and well known to the Residency as such; but becoming involved in local Persian poli tics he found himself in difficulties and had to flee the town, taking refuge for some time at Busreh. i hen things had quieted down he proceeded to Bunder Abbas and obtained the Landing Contract there, final ly he migrated to Lingah where he died some 2 years ago, being succeeded by his son Nejef who hag. now lodged a claim with His Majesty’s Consul, Bunder Abbas. When the lease of 10th April 1393 was granted by Shaikh Salim bin Sultan, the plain fact of its grant appears to have been duly reported by the Residency Agent, Shargah (on Gist May 1393) but no report was made by him of the supplementary deed admitting Ra- khoda Ali to partnership and the first mention of the latter was contained in a letter dated 23th May 1393 from /JJ 41y # from our Lingali Agent, who, in reporting Lingah hews i egarding the lease, Quoted ITakhoda Ali as the chief concessionaire and iiassan Samaiyeh only as his co sharer, As the Lingah news was divergent from the ohargah report and appeared to be mistaken in regardto llakhoda Ali no action was considered necessary, no thing more was heard of the concession for 4 years, during which period Makhoda Ali continued to super intend the mining of the oxide on behalf of the part ners, as prescribed in his agreement. In 1902 another report was received from our Lingah Agent, who, after referring to the Abu Musa Concession, went on to say that he had reason to believe that Nakhoda Ali was now attempting to obtain from the Shaikh of Shargah a similar lease, of the mines on Sir Bu Kuair Island, and that as he, Kakhoda Ali, was an indifferent cha racter and of late suspected of intriguing with Rus sian Agents, he advised that the Trucial Shaikhs should be warned to discontinue communication with him On receipt of this information the Chief of Shargah was addressed by my predecessor Colonel Kemball, who »» - asked for a copy of the concession said to have been granted to Nakhoda Ali for working the Red Oxide mines on the Island of Abu Musa' and also advised the Shaikh to let him (the Resident.)see a draft of any Concession! which he might be intending to grant to Nakhoda Ali in connection with Sir Bu Nuair Island. The Shaikh replied on the 11th October 1902 that he had entered into no lease with anyone in regard to Sir Bu Nuair, and that as regards Abu Musa the concession for min ing had been granted to iiassan Samaiyeh etc. , and not to Fakhoda Ali. It is possible Shaikh Sagar may not have been aware of the secondary deed introducing Fakhoda Ali, but the signature of our Agent Abdul Latif was on the document itself and therefore the latter's behaviour In neither reporting It at the time (in 1393) nor subsequently (1902) can hardly be regarded/ regarded as quite straightforward. It will be seen that whereas the original lease was dated 13th Zilkaadeh ir'15 (10th April 1393) the document admitting Nakhoda Ali was written a few days later i. e. during the following month Zilhijjeh (from about 21st April to 19th May 1393. This is consis tent with the reference made to it in the statement I now come to the correspondence with Lieutenant Gabriel His Majesty’s Consul,Bunder Abbas, from which it will be seen that the Dragoman of the German Consul ate at Bushire (a responsible person who was placed in charge of the German Consulate during Dr Liste- mann 1 s absence and with whom His Majesty s Minister in connection with the wreck of the *’Teutonia desired me to correspond as the official representative of German interests} on his way down to Shargah with the .direct letters of 19th June from ^r Listemann to two the,.Shaikhs, called at Bunder Abbas and endeavoured A ' Ali to induce Nejef bin Uakhoda A to sign a document to the the German firm was made with his consent. Nejef refused however and has since lodged a formal com plaint with His Majesty’s Consul claiming a share of proceeds of the sale of oxide and the ownership of the implements now at the island^ together with other It is clear from Esa bin Abdul Latif’s recorded statement, that the partners, Hassan, Abdalla bin Hassan, Esa bin Abdul Latif and Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh, and,later, Shaikh Sagar, all started with equal shares and endowed w T ith equal rights under each share. SubseQuently 'When the share of Shaikh cagar passed to xr usuf bin Abdalla and from him to Hassan Samaiyeh the latter acquired a double share in the profits but otherwise the equality of his position and of obli gation in relation to his co-sharers was just the of Esa bin Abdul Latif now forwarded. JZ^xiiO effect that the contract concluded between Hassan and separate claims. same—/ same as beiore. It is also clear from Nakhoda Ali’s deed oj. partnership that the partners were all aware 3 and agreed, inter se, that the cognizance and consent o f partners was obligatory. This was obviously necessary as the partners were scattered, at Shargah, Lingah^and Bunder Abbas, and anyone of them might be / hearing of openings for sales and need to communicate with the others. By their action in sending the Consulate ^ragoman to Bunder Abbas to endeavour to induce Nejef bin h T a- khoda Ali to sign a document, probably to be antedated testifying to his cognizance and approval of the Ger man contract, the German claimants have surely com mitted themselves to the recognition both of the fact that general consultation was necessary and that Nejef bin Nakhoda Ali had inherited his father’s share in the Concession and his rights under it. These two points seem to be of no little impor tance. It is to be noted that if we may judge from the translation supplied with the German Case the docu ments with Nejef bin Nakhoda Ali, and ilassan Samaiyeh, respectively are not quite identical.Private letter from Mr-Tigraae Jlaloolrn r British protected merchant of Eushire to Major Cox, dated. 2r'rd August 1906. u'i. -A. .A.

Concerning the Abu Jiusa oxide, for which there were 4 Concessionaires among whom, 1 hold the deed of partnership of my father. My father had no other heir but myself and there fore after his death, Haji Hassan bin Aii acknowledged my right of partnership as acquired through my father. At the time when Hassan entered into the agreement with Messrs Wonckhaus he gave me no information whatever on the subject. Subsequently I made an arrangement with Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar to sell him cxi&amp;e and sent word to Hassan to this effect. Hassan then wrote me that he had made a contract elsewhere and would inform me regarding it later. As proof that I did not in any way agree to this contract made by Eassan, I point to the fact that it did not bear my signature and when some months later, Abdulla bin Hassan and the German Munshi came and askod me to sign it in Goken of assent, I refused to do so, as I had not been con sulted in the first place. As further proof of my right in the concession I may mention that in 1904 Abdulla bin Hassan had a case in Calcutta against Messrs Sassoon concerning the Abu Musa Oxide, but seeing that the oxide had been sold in the name of my father, the case could not be proceeded with until T had fur nished a Power of Attorney for the Calcutta Court a copy of this is doubtless on your.records. (Note by H•B.M’s Consul. The Consulate fee book shows that Nejef paid f/- iees for the execution of a power of attorney on the 29th October 1904}• Now I complain that from the time that Hasaan as been active^/ engaged in the oxide work of Bu Musa, I have not received one Dinar of the proceeds, although all the work on the Island formerlyformerly devolved upon my father, who himself found the imple ments, etc., for working the oxide, which implements are even new at the Island. Besides all this, there were 250 carpets which belonged to my father and which were sent to Calcutta for sale. Abdullah bin Hassan wanted, to settle up the account for them in Calcutta but until T gave a power of attorney they would not settle with him. Hassan subsequently collected all the money, but I have never been able to recover any of it from him. Now I pray you of your goodness to look after my rights and to obtain me'justice against Hassan.

Dated 17th Moharrum 1585• After compliments. With the highest respect I beg to represent that I have learnt that Gheikh Sagar bin Khaiid in pursuance of the advice of the British Government has arranged that Hassan bin All Samaiyeh, should the German Firm ask him to ship the oxid© which is lying on th© beach of the island and ready for shipment, should be permitted to ship it on specific conditions. Seeing that T was originally a partner in the said concession, I have thought it necessary to make the following representation to you. It is now ten years since the commencement of the lease and in the beginning it was agreed between us partners that no sale or transaction should be completed without consultation with all; and in this past period Haji Hasoan bin Ali Samaiyeh extracted a large amount of oxide from the mines of Abu Ivtosa Island, and he had been always accumulating it against the a time that he might find /v purchaser, so that the oxide might be ready for sale* Thus I opine that from the commencement up till now he has sold probably 8000 tons and now there is probably available in the 'island some 6000 tons or* more, which they have extracted from the mines a long time since. Out of that is th© quantity which * as mentioned above they have brought down to the sea shore for shipment by German Ship; I have not ceased to ask him (Hassan) to render an account but have not obtained it, and Haji Hassan has not given anyone anything whatever; and I fear that by reason of the termination of the concession it is probable that Haji Hassan will put the whole of this oxide to his own credit and seeing that this oxide which is available there was extracted before the inci-* dence of Hassan^ agreement with Wonckhaus which I did not agree to, and in any case previous to the annulijiQnt of the deed of lease by Sheikh Sagar, I consider myself entitled to my share in all the oxide“““ ,h “ B ' b “' *“*««*• 1 — «—«•«.««(g beg from your kindness that Hajl Hassan should be called upon to place Ms accounts before you from first to last, so that he may not alter or change the account and that there be a dlviBioh ao- cording to sharee, so ttiat each, may ta^e his share. 7f tl i % Ifll ;i U'€iv l £ From To Sagar bin Khalid. Kajor Cox British Resident in the Persian Gulf. rated 19th Muharram 1326. After compliments. As you are awe cn the 19th Muharrem 1325 we decided to annul the deed of contract for the oxide contract of Abu Musa, which was in the hands of Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh and his partners and subsequently we expelled his workmen from the is land. We now learn that Eaji Hasaan bin Ali Samaiyeh on 10th October 1907, that is to say after 8 months after the annulment of the concession, sold a share in the oxide company which had formerly belonged to Yusuf bin Abdulla. How could this person possibly sell a share in a concern which a long time since had been done away with wholly and entirely. And seeing that the procedure of Haji Hassan is against all principles and his motive is to create confusion, it is necessary for me to inform you that I am unable to accept or agree to this action and in view of the tact that the buyer and seller are dependents of hhe British Government, I request that you will take steps for the suppression of these objectionable proceedings.. «r UL, i^videnoe Hecorded regarding repulsion of German Tihow from Abu Musa on October S-^rd 1007 in course of which some shots were fired.N r^ STATEMENT of Gulum Elassan, GuIum Hasean states on soleisn affi3?isationJ I have been living on Abu Musa as caretaker of gardens and flocks for th© last 12 or 15 years. The following are the circuastances under which shots were fired by Shaikh Sagans guards in connection with the arrival of Abdalla bin Hassan Saaaiyeh in a 'boom' (pattern of native craft) frona Lingah. The vessel arrived about noon and drop ped anchor off the spot where the oxide is shipped from about 300 yards to the westward of the heaps on the seashore. A jolly boat full of people put off from her after she had an chored and came towards the shore. At this time there were only 10 or 15 men present out of Shaikh Sagar*s guard, the rest were over at the village. Some of those present were now on the seashore in front of the oxide heaps and some above them on the rocks at the side. Those on shore shouted to the people in the boat not to approach but as she cam© on, one, or two, shots were fired from the rocks near the big oxide heap. They were not fired at the boat or dhow but in the air. The German was in the boat and at the time one Haji Ali whom I understand to be the German^ clerk was standing up in the bows of the boat ready to jump off as the boat neared the shore, but I myself called out to him, ,, plon , t attempt to land as there is no permission for it. 11 I heard no answer. Then the guards on the shore called out,'If you want to ask or see anything send a man ashore, he can see and go back.' Two negroes whose names I do not know, then jumped into .he water and swam ashore. They only remained a few minutes. They were led up to the huts where Shaikh Abdulla bin Ahmed bin Sultan was - (he was in charge of the guard from Shargah)- and they asked him what was the position of affairs and why had the shots been fired. He replied, 'Tfe are ordered not to let anyone land; if you don’t like it go and get permis sion /^/&gt;/ / pernission from Shaikh Sagar.' They then returned to the boat, and the boat to the boom. As the dhoY/ did not show any signs of departing the guard feared she Might be intending to stay till dark and try and effect a landing, so about 4 p.ra. they began shouting to the dhow warning her to be off , at this time there were waves and some surf. Soon afterwards, I being in the huts at the time, I heard 3 or 4 shots fired by our men, but I did not see what The dhow then I believe moved, from her place and went further round to the right but I did not see any more of her myself. Dated Abu Musa, February 17th 1908. ft? a*ri STATEMENT of Mattur bin Shastiaan. Mattur bin Sharahan states on solemn affirmation,: I was one of the guard which Shaikh Sagar sent over to Abu Musa and was present on the occasion when shots were fired in connection with the presence there of a dhow from Lingah. The dhow arrived about noon and anchored opposite the oxide heapson the shore. The guards who had gone over from Shargah were about 80 in all. Of these about 50 were present at the oxide heaps when the boom arrived. After she had anchored a rowing boat put from her containing about 10 persons. As they got near we recognised Abdalla bin Samai- yeh and a native clerk of the Germans, who was known by sight to some of us. I did not notice the German himself. Tfhen we saw Abdalla some of us called out', w Don , t come near, dontH come near Abdalla. n He merely answered by calling out and gesticulating to his boatmen to row harder. We shouted,'We will fire at you if you attempt to approach.” Abdalla then said to his rowers; 'Don’t mind what they say, they will not shoot.' We repeated that we would fire. He replied 'Fire away', we then fired 4 shots in the air over their heads. I did not fire myself. We should have fired straight at them had not Shaikh Abdalla bin Ahmed who was in charge of us, given us orders (which he sent through me) to fire in the air. On our firing they turned back a little and called out to us, 'What is this all about?' We replied, 'If you want to get news, send 2 men ashore. On tha^ they sent 2 negroes (one named Salim)who jumped into the water and swam ashore. They said, 'Why do you stop us from coming ashore seeing that the island belongs to the German and Hassan bin Samaiyeh We replied,'The island belongs to Shaikh Sagar.' The negroes said that Abdalla bin Hassan had not told the German that and from what they said it appeared that they had brought him tiiii W ■hia, tke Geraan on false pretences. After this conversation we told them they must return to the boom; and we warned them that if the boom did not depart before sundown we should have to fire on her. They then went off to her. The boom did not move, however, and we feared that after night fall she might endeavour to make a landing. Accordingly Abdal- la bin Haraed told 3 of the guard to go to the cliff and fire some shots. They however fired 6 shots above the boom. It was not intended that they should fire at the boom as a matter of fact, I did hear one shot strike her, or strike something other than the water. The man who fired that shot was Abdur- rahim bin Saif of the Holi tribe who let off his rifle before getting it to his shoulder. After this the boon weighed anchor and got off just at sunset, but they only moved a little way and anchored again opposite the mud enclosure father up. Four of us then went along the shore parallel and stayed there until 3 hours after sunset (about 9 p.m.). Then seeing that they were apparently intending to pass the night there, our men fired 2 more in the air above the dhow. She then took her departure. Our object was to frighten the visitors away. shots Dated Shargah, February 21st 1908The Question of Mr Thomas Brovin's Nationality. The Government of India will remember that in my telegram U&amp;rtt? dated 12tii February, I expressed doubts as to Brown’s nationality being British, as stated in the German Case, the facts being*,so far as my knowledge Trent; (i) - That he had not registered himself in Eushire as a British subject* (ii) That neither his accent, nor his bearing, when in Eushire from time to time, gave one any reason to regard him as British. (iii) That to the best of rny belief Mr Wonckhaus or Mr Brown himself had in conversation, soon after my arrival here, mentioned his being a naturalis ed German. (iv) That the German Consul, ^r Listemann, who has previously joined my dinner party on Christ mas night, expressed his inability to accept our invitation this year because he was expecting the 'German community' to spend Xmas with him* One of his guests was Mr Brown. x (v) That Mr Marling in his despatch Fq. 231 dated fist December TX)? to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, had quoted Baron von Richthofen, the German Minister, as saying that the Shaikh of Shargah 'had fired on a German subject named Brown. ' (vi) That there were other incidental reierences on my record.to Brown, or Braun, 'the German. (vii) Finally that though he came to Bushire a few days after the firing incident at Abu Musa he made no report or complaint to me on the subject nor did he do so at Lingah to the Residency Agent. There were some grounds therefore for the uncertainty thatthat existed. On my making inquiries at %% Lingah however, I was assured by Khan Saheb Agha Eadr that when Brown first joined Messrs Fonckhaus’s firm at Lingah, from Europe, he possessed a British passport; and that olue enabled me to trace the reference to him on the Residency Records. It now appears that on loth June l^Ol Mr Brown passed through Bushire by direct steamer from Europe and having landed while the ship was lying in port, he called on the Extra Assistant Resident and ashed for a British passport. In support of this request he declared that he had been born of English parents at Hemelengen near Bre men, and in proof of his statement produced a certi ficate purporting to have been recorded by the Pro vost of Dundee certifying the British Nationality of one John Brown, whom the applicant claimed as his father. A copy of this certificate is on my record and I attach a duplicate of it. When producing this document, Mr Brown stated that he had obtained it in order to avoid compulsory military service in Germany, which he would otherwise have been obliged to undergo, he having been born and bred, in Germany. On the strength of the said document a British pass port was issued to Mr Brown. Before granting him a passport it might have been well had the Residency ashed him to produce a birth- certificate, for as it is, we have only his word for it that he is the son of the John Brown figuring in the ^'undee certificate. Be that as it may, however, 1 presume that for pur poses of the present case we must accept the /iew that he is actually a British subject and on the whole it seems advantageous to us that we should do H For instance whereas, in case he were a German, the so.the German Government would perhaps be in a better yeh on 10th or 16th October was a valid contract, now that Brown is admittedly a British subject the trans action becomes one between two British subjects and the British Government are the sole judges of its legality. position to argue that the Transfer by Hassan SamaiCity Chambers, T&gt; undee 22nd May 1901 I, TMlliam Hunter, Lord Provost and Chief Magistrate of the City and Royal Burgh of ^undee, certify that John Brown, Manager of the Jute Spimerei and Beberei Hemelingen Bremen Germany, if a British Sub/ieot and resided down to about 1374 in -undee in that part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland cal led Scotland and that he is worthy of faith and good credit* In faith and testimony whereof I have caused the se,al of the said City and Royal Burgh of -undee to be affined hereto this twenty second day of May in the year one thousand nine hundred, (Sd) Uilliam Hunter, Lord Provost and Chief Magistrate ox the City and Royal Burgh of Dundee,—Identity of the German, Subject said to have been with Mr Brown when he visited Abu Musa and was fired upon on 2frd October 1907, The other doubtful 'German subject' who accom panied Mr Brown to Abu Musa was one Haji Ali Tashan- ker, mentioned in Br Listemann's letter of 19th Novem ber to the Shaikh of Shargah, In answ r er to my queries our Lingah Agent said Haji Ali was not a Persian but was believed to come from 'Tunis'.

I observe that in the Memorandum addressed by you to that Legation on the 15th November, 1907, it is stated that the privilege of extracting oxide from Abu Musa “had been leased on a year’s basis by the Sheikh of Sharga to a Syndicate of three British subjects ” ; whereas, in the copy of the contract between the Sheikh and the Syndicate, which is in the possession of this Department, no term for the lease is mentioned ; and the India Office, to whom I caused an inquiry on this point to be addressed, state, as you will perceive from the inclosed copy of a letter from them,* that there is in their archives no document bearing out the assertion. Apart from this statement, which would thus appear to be erroneous, I approve the language of the communications which you have addressed to the German Legation, as well as that of your proposed warning to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Herr Woenckhaus is reported to have stated that h h 1 documentary evidence was in his possession to the ef- A /'V fYl « 'Z’ ffect that 'the British Resident in the Persian Gulf | 2MAH.i3ub T IIMDIA OFFICE^) had instructed the Sheikh of Shargah not to enter into an agreement with a German firm'. This statement would seem to go somewhat further than the action which was reported in Major Cox’s let ter of November 29th, 1906, which forms the enclosure in your letter of June 15th, 1907. According to the correspondence forwarded by Major Cox, the Sheikh was warned The Under Secretary of State, India Office.warned against entering into any agreement with the German firm, without previous consultation with the Resi dent. A warning of this qualified nature differs essentially from an absolute veto such as that im plied by Herr Woenckhaus, and is, in the opinion of Sir £• Grey, fully justified by the obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Trucial Chiefs, whose material welfare is closely bound up with the mainte nance of order in the Persian Gulf, and whose means of livelihood are so slender as to render any ill-consi dered arrangement of far-reaching effect. I am to enquire whether Mr. Morley is satisfied that the warning reported by Major Cox, in his letter above-referred to, 'constitutes the only communication made by him in this connection before Messrs. Woenck haus had acquired an interest in the concession, or whether there is reason to suppose that some warning of a nature similar to that alleged by Herr Woenckhaus was also conveyed to the Sheikh and has not been re ported.I am further to enquire, with reference to my letter of December 28th, whether the Government of India have yet formulated suggestions as to the future working of the concession on Abu Musa.

Further report regarding Sheikh Salim’s precise rights on on i ? e sent after enquiry at Sharga. Hitherto, though present as aT ffi 11 s a a( ™ er at a11 mt erviews with Sheikh by myself and Consul, Bunder Abbas, Salim has never attempted to assert any independent rights of ownership over island or mines. “ Clause 2.—In his complaint to Sheikh dated 20th February 1907, third partner asserted that Hassan had no power of acting without consent of other partners, and this is clearly corroborated by Enclosure No. 2 of German case. S laU ? e 3 - —See telegram No. 17. Hassan, a British subject, sold on 10th October to Brown, another British subject, a share in a concession which no longer existed. Theoretically, therefore, Brown should prosecute Hassan m British Court for obtaining money_ by false pretences, and Wonckhaus should enter civil claim versus Brown in British Court for refund of price paid for share of non-existent concern. “ Clause 4.—According to Enclosure 2 of German case the Company also included a fourth party apart from Wonckhaus. “ Clause 7. —Enclosures 16 to 24’Vre new to me. “ Clause 10.—-RegardingHrown’s nationality, see my telegram No. 17. If he, a British subject, was attacked by British protected person on island, why did he not complain to British Consular authorities? Identity of alleged German employe is under investigation. “ Clause 15.—The “ young Esa ” is a family man about 30 years of age. “ Clause 22.—The German contract was kept secret at Brown’s express bidding. I have in original the written statement to this effect by Hassan Samaiyeh. Much less was it ever registered in the British Court, or attested by British Agent, Lingah. The trucial chiefs are under standing injunctions not to give concessions without consulting British authorities. This is very necessary in order to prevent the unsophisticated Arabs from getting- exploited by unscrupulous persons. “ Clause 23.—Letter to which German Enclosure 6 is a reply, and which is carefully omitted by them, did not forward copy of document at all but merely gave garbled purport. Directly third partner, who knows no English, received a copy and got it translated into Arabic, he saw it was objectionable and repudiated it. The sentence ‘ annulment is preferable to its continuance’ is polite way of saying ‘it should be annulled.’ As the contract was in English it is possible that Hassan himself never accurately understood it, or perhaps was given incorrect Arabic translation of it by Brown. “ Clauses 26 and 27.—Whole German case seems based on fraud or invalidity of transaction between two British subjects. “ Clause 32.—I will obtain precise details and report later. “ Enclosure 1 of German case.—The words ‘ as long as they choose to possess ’ are not accurate rendering. It should be ‘ as long as there is to them a purpose in the mines.’ “Enclosure 2.—The inclusion of this document is curious.

My telegram of 4th February. Abu Musa. Following from Cox dated 12th February :— “ Government of India telegram No. 55, dated 29th January. “ First. There is absolutely no evidence on my record suggesting that ownership of island or mines rests with Sheikh Salim. “ On the contrary, there is ample evidence to show that the island is the recognised property of that section of the Jowasmi tribe inhabiting the piratical coast, of which the ruling chief Sharga is the head, and in whom all quasi sovereignty and territorial rights are vested. “ These rights, according to Residency records, the present Sheikh has never failed to keep alive by documentary assertion and it was for him as Sheikh of the Jowasmi that we recovered the island in 1904, and not for Sheikh Salim. “ In letter to Resident in 1902, when no dispute existed regarding concession, the Sheikh wrote to the Resident that the concession had been granted by Sheikh Salim while acting as Regent during his own temporary absence. Since his ejection from the Sheikhship in 1883, it has been held that Sheikh Salim has possessed no rights of jurisdiction either on Abu Musa or anywhere else, and he has merely been a pensioner in receipt of stipend from ruling Sheikh on condition of his loyalty and obedience. This stipend was first fixed by documentary agreements of which a copy was furnished with Residency letter No. 165, dated 8th August 1883. Sheikh Sagar having failed to pay this allowance regularly Sheikh Salim visited the Residency Agent on 16th June 1884 and stated himself to be in absolute penury, and besought Agent to induce Sheikh to provide him with bare subsistence allowance. Agent’s efforts resulted in substitution of second agreement reported in Residency letter No. 134, dated 10th July 1884. “ This again was broken in 1888, but by good offices of Residency Agent a third document was executed under which Salim now received a fixed allowance of 400 dollars per annum, was allowed to return to Sharga and obtained employment as his nephew’s Vizier or adviser. This document and arrangement still hold good as far as we know.” “ The presumption is that Sheikh Salim is allowed to receive the 250 dollars coming annually from the concessionaires as part of his pension, but I cannot state this for certain without enquiry at Sharga, In any case Sheikh Sagar has no power to alienate any sovereign territorial rights in Abu Musa which he himself only enjoys as ruling chief of Jowasmi clan, and if any document has been passed to Sheikh baling making over such rights we are under obligation in the interests of the principality to have it cancelled as having been granted ultra vires. On the other hand it is a recognised custom in all such oriental principalities for the ruling chief who has to maintain numerous relations to give them instead^ of cash allowances the enjoyment of landed property within the State. This is puiely a family arrangement, which can be suspended at any time at the will of the rulei, and alienation of such property by his relative would, in the case of our protected chiefs, be a violation of the rules of the chief’s treaty obligations to us. “ Secondly. I hope it will be possible to obtain copies of German enclosures 4 (d) and 4 (e). “ Thirdly. Question of non-consent of all partners. Comment will iollow after visit to Sharga. A -u i “ Fourthly. Transfer of share to Brown on 10th October. As whole concession was cancelled on 21st February, Hassan Samaiyeh had no longer any rights which he could transfer on 10th October.———TJVith the compliments of the Under - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Foreign Office, , igo%.V No. 30£, dated the 19th November 1907. From— H. Listmann, Esq., Consul for the Imperial German Government, To— Sheikh Saggar bin Khalid. After Compliments. The firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Company have submitted to me a complaint as follows:— Firstly, in accordance with your orders, the German firm have been forcibly prevented from taking possession of oxide at the Bu Musa island which they are entitled to possess in conformity with a valid contract which (they have from Haji Hass&amp;n bin Ali Someiyah and Company. Secondly, your men, whom you have posted on theBu Musa island, have fired rifles at Mr. Thomas Brown, the representative of the said firm at Lingah and his men, amongst whom was Haji Ali bin Tasanker, a subject of the German Government and * endangered tbeir lives, preventing them from landing in the island to safeguard the properties belonging to them ftnd to the German Steamers. In respect 'of the first matter, I have to point that by the contract which Hasan bin Ali Someiyah and Company have made with the German firm, he (Hasan)has given them the right to take possession of the oxide in the Bu Musa island. Whereas Hasan bin Ali Someiyah and Company have been acting several years on behalf of all the lease-holders and whereas many transactions have been carried on in this name “ Hasan bin Ali Someiyah and Company,’* the aforesaid firm are entitled to consider that all the lease-holders are included in that signature. And, likewise, the validity of the contract made by Hasan bin Aii Someiyah and Company with the German firm cannot be doubted legally. You have notified to Haji Hasan bin Ali Someiyah and Company that you will withdraw the deed of lease from them. Whereas the said deed of lease dated 18th Zilq’adeh 1315, is from Sheikh Salem bin Sultan and not from you, and whereas you yourself have confirmed Sheikh Salem bin Sultan’s right to give a lease and have also corroborated the validity of that lease by your taking a share in this (present) lease ; it is for these reasons, not possible for me and I will not agree (to recognise) that you have any rights to nullify this deed of lease. Furthermore, Sheikh Salem bin Sultan himself cannot, according to the facts mentioned in that document, give a notice nullifying the same; and, for this^ reason, I would ask you to take such actions, without delay, as may enable Haji Hasan bin Ali Someiyah and Company to give delivery of the oxide which has been bought of them by the German firm in accordance with the contract, and Haji Hasan bin Ali Someiyah and Company have taken a consi derable sum on the oxide, of which a large quantity is to be shipped to Ham burg at thd end of the current month. Should this shipment become impos sible through your actions, you will [naturally become responsible for the loss which will amount to Rs. 1,00,000, one-lakh. I ' With regard to the second matter, I have reported to my Government and await their instructions. I have to repeat that the share which iyou had in the lease of the mines and which you transferred at the time, has become the property of the firm by purchase, which for this reason, has direct concern in the working of the mines without any molestation. Moreover,'Haji Hasan bin Ali Someiyah and Abdulla bin Hasan Someiyah have given a full power of attorney to the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Company on ^this subject, and the said power of attorney has been produced to me. I request you to give the answer of this letter to its bearer. 1' $11^3811 This is what was necessary to be explained and Salaams.No. 301, dated the 19th November 1907. Sv From— H.

As you have bound yourself to the lease-holders, in the deed of lease dated 15th Zelq ad eh 1325, to pay respect and honour to their men whom they employ on the oxide mines, it is for you to see that the deed of lease is enforced without molestation and the lease-holders are enabled to act according to the contract with the German firm. The enforcement of this act rests with you and I ask you to do it. This is what was necessary to be said and Salaams. 9 I ' 11 i - m G. I. C. P. O.-No 4739 F.

Apart from this I have received news that Abdulla bin Massan has publicly spoken with the Arabs that Hassan bin SomeiyehSomeiyeh had addressed the British Resident at Bushire the subject oi the red oxide and had received an answer from the Resident that he will have nothing to do in the matter hut that he has made a reference to the government of India; and that in consequence of Sheikh Bugger's molestation, the German Hen-of-war will inevitably visit Shargah and take the ^u liusa island from Sheikh Sugger, by force, with compensation for the loss caused to the German frade by the (case of) red oxide* _his is what I have gathered.(^5 Memorandum showing details of a conversation held between liirsa Hussein and Sheikh Sugger and carried on through the medium of an interpreter Abdulla bin Hessan bin Someiyeh as the I'lirza could not speak Arabic.

Grey to transmit herewith to be laid before Mr. Secretary Morley copy of a despatch on the subject from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran report ing his action in the matter and forwarding copies of correspondence with the German Legation. It will be seen that in the memorandum which Mr. Marling addressed to the German Charge d’Affaires on November 15th. he stated that the privilege of extract ing oxide from Abu Musa had been leased on a year’s basis by the Sheikh of Shargah to a Syndicate of three British subjects. I am to enquire whether Mr. Morley can suggest any explanation of this statement ? as in the copy of the contract which was communicated by the India Office to this Under Secretary of State, India Office.* &gt; this Department no term was mentioned.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received January 20, 1908.) (No. 281.) gj r Tehran, December 31, 1907. ON the 6tli ultimo I received from the German Legation the Memorandum of which a copy is inclosed, stating that certain employes of the German firm of Wonckhaus had been driven by the Sheikh of Shargah from the mines of red oxide on Abu Musa Island, which they were working in virtue of an Agreement with the concessionnaires, and that one of His Majesty’s ships had been present to afford assistance to the Sheikh. . „ . I replied, in a private note to M. Stemrich, with whom I was on very friendly terms that I would telegraph for a report of the occurrence from His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire, hut that, from what I knew of the case, I believed that Messrs Wonckhaus’ contract was invalid, as it bad been made with only one of three joint concessionnaires, and without the knowledge or consent of the other two In a subsequent conversation I told him that the Sheikh of Shargah was under British protection. I said also that I was not sure how far the Legation had jurisdiction in such a question, but I was inclined to believe that it rested wholly with His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire. , , , v . Major Cox’s telegraphic report reached me on the 15th, and on the same day I communicated to M. Stemrich the Memorandum of which a copy is inclosed. The German Minister replied acknowledging my Memorandum, and saying that he expected a report from the German Consul at Bushire, of the contents of wlnci I expected to be informed by the German Charge d’Affaires ; ^t beyond a casual reference to it by myself a few days later, there was no mentl0 ^ ^ 14th December, when I learnt from Major Cox’s telegram of winch a paraphrase is inclosed, that the German Consul had been m direct and with the Sheikh, refusing to recognize the cancellation of the Concession, a thrcatemn 0 * him with a claim for heavy damages. I therefore sent my telegram No. 379 of the 14th December to you Sir, suggesting that I “be authorized 'to inform Baron ^ohthofen of the Sheikh s oblations to TTk Maiestv’s Government under the Protectorate Treaty o± the mi maren, 1892 and reauestin^ him to instruct Dr. Listemann to regulate his conduct accord- [ngD It X same tinie I requested Major Cox to desire the Sheikh to take no ^^^S^cordance with your instructmns,^! address^ toBaron rtlmlmYwrotJIskin^ for'ene,' anTfte Mowing day Baron von Richthofen called on me.

ON the 6th November the German Legation communicated to the British Legation a telegram from Busbire, signed Abdul Hussein, reporting comp am s rom Wonckhaus, Lingab, relative to the working of the red oxide mines at Abu Musa, is evident that this telegram lias been sent upon erroneous information as to tne alleged facts of the complaint, and also in complete misapprehension ot the existing conditions at Abu Musa. The real facts and conditions are set forth below toi t information of the German Legation. , The privilege of extracting oxide from Abu Musa had been leased on a 7 basis by the Sheikh of Shargah to a Syndicate of three British subjects. One 0 ± the concessionnaires complained to the Sheikh a few months ago that, withou is knowledge or concurrence, a monopoly of the purchase of the output °xide had been granted to a fourth party by another of the concessionnaires. The o vious illegality and invalidity of such a grant were pointed out to the German Mims er in a letter by M r. Marling acknowledging the receipt of the telegram in question. In view, therefore, of the fact that one of three concessionnaires was clearly incapable of’ granting a monopoly without authorization from his colleagues, and m view of the Sheikh’s own strong personal objection to the existence of su ® h a monopoly, the latter decided to resume the Concession, and accordingly informed tlie British concessionnaire to this effect. The British concessionnaire, however, did no stop his mining operations on receipts of this notice. On the 10th October, tbeie ore, the Sheikh formally notified him that he would be forcibly ejected if, within ten days, he had not removed his workmen and implements. As, however, the concessionnanestill neglected to comply, an armed guard was sent by the Sheikh to carry out the eviction. To avoid unnecessary harshness or violence it was deemed advisable that the British Consul at Bandar Abbas should be present as a spectator on board His Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing.” From this the following points are clear :— 1. That it was the British subject whose workmen were ejected, not M. Wonckhaus’ employes ; that if any one could consider himself harshly used—which was appa rently not the case—it would be the British subject, not M. Wonckhaus ; 2. That the British Consul was present in a gun-boat in the interests of good order in a case which concerned a British subject. Any other allegations, such as those made in Abdul Hussein’s telegram, are therefore quite erroneous; 3. That even if M. Wonckhaus’ contract was valid—and he must undoubtedly, as a business man, have known that it was not—it concerned only the purchase of oxide delivered on board steamers, and he had no concern whatever either with the mines or with mining operations. The British Legation hopes that the foregoing remarks have made it clear to the German Legation that the question concerns the Sheikh of Shargah and the British concessionnaire alone, and that the agent, Abdul Hussein, was in ignorance of the true facts of the case when he dispatched his telegram. The Concession having now been resumed by its owner, the differences between the lessees have been removed by the removal from their hands of the subject of contention; and the whole matter seems, therefore, to call for no further comment. British Legation, Tehran, November lo, 1907. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Major Cox to Mr. Marling. (Telegraphic.) P. Bushire, December 13, 1907. WITH reference to Abu Musa Island incident, I have to report that Dragoman of German Consulate proceeded to Shargah on the 22nd November from Busline, accompanied by concessionnaire. This individual presented on the 2Sth November to the Sheikh of Shargah and to his uncle, Sheikh Salim, two official letters addressed to them respectively by the German Consul at Bushire ; I have just received the original letters from the Sheikh. Following are contents of letters : — 1. Befusal to accept Sheikh’s cancellation of lease ; 2. Protest against proceedings of Sheikh ; and 3. Threat to claim 1 lakh should permission not be granted to ship oxide. In view of fact that you were approached hy German Minister on the 10th November, we should, in my opinion, strongly take exception to action of erman Consul in trying, by a direct communication of the nature explained above, to biuit Sheikh, who is under British protection. If you share this view, kindly state whether I am to communicate with German Bepresentative here, or whether ma er wi e dealt with at Tehran. , No reply has been vouchsafed to letters by Sheikh; my colleague and myself have not broached question of Abu Musa Island.

His Majesty’s GoveTOnent, however, see no objection to Robert Wonckhaus removing the red oxide which has alre? dy been mined and is now ready for shipment from the island. If this proposal as to the removal of the red oxide in qi esti^n meets with the concur rence of the German Government, His Majesty’s loveni- ment would advise the Sheikh accordingly and would arrange for the Indian Government to take whatever ^ step seemed desirable to ensure that all pr per facilities are placed at the disposal of r.

Wonckhaus respect ing red oxide on the island of Abu Musa. I was very much obliged to the German Govern ment fcr having put the case so fully before us. Their statement differed in some important particu lars from the information which I had so far receiv ed. Their statement had now been handed to the &gt; India Office to be sent out by mail, in order that it might be carefully examined and that I might be supplied with the fullest possible information. The Indian Government had a Resident at Bushire, from whom we could get full information. Count Metternich remarked that he thought a British Consul had been on the gun-boat which visit ed Abu Musa.

I must wait for further information on the points submitted hy the German Government.

Their statement differed in some important particulars from the information which I had so far received. Their statement had now been handed to the India Office to be sent out by mail, in order that it might be carefully examined and that I might be supplied with the fullest possible information. The Indian Government had a Resident at Bushire, from whom we could get full information Count Metternich remarked that he thought a British Consul had been on the gun-boat which visited Abu Musa. I said this very probably was the case. We had a Treaty with the Sheikh dating back to a very long time ago^but finally confirmed and ratified in 1892, by which the Sheikh was under our protection and had agreed not to enter into any Agreement or correspondence with any other Power. I must wait for further information on the points submitted by the German Government. But I might say at once that although, as the Mining Concession had been cancelled some time ago, no fresh oxide could be mined pending a further decision, yet it seemed clear that Messrs. Wdnckhaus were entitled to the red oxide which had actually been mined already, which was waiting to be taken away, and which might he regarded as already sold to them. A complaint had been made that when their agent, Mr. Brown, visited Abu Musa the Sheikh’s officers had fired upon him; and we were sending instructions to the Indian Government in order that they might do whatever was necessary to insure that, if Messrs. Wonckhaus visited the island for the purpose of taking away the oxide which was waiting there for removal, there should he no further trouble of the kind. [B] ASIATIC TURKEY.

GREY has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the note from the German Charge d’Affaires, dated the 31st December, 1907, on the subject of the contract between Messrs. Wonckhaus and a native British subject for the purchase of red oxide from the island of Abu Musa. His Majesty s Government fully appreciate the courtesy of the German Govern- men m communicating without reserve the documents in their possession, and the examination o± the German case is being actively pursued. The facts set out in these papers differ materially from those which had been reported to Sir E. Grey, and it will be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to a PPv to the parties concerned for further information. • ^ re J r observes that Messrs. Wonckhaus claim that they are now partners m the Concession originally granted in 1898, but inasmuch as this Concession had een cance ed by the Sheikh of Shargah some months before any share therein was transferred to Messrs. Wonckhaus, he cannot admit that they are entitled to assume any such position. a • P ref,en ^ juncture His Majesty’s Government do not think that it would be esirable that the Sheikh of Shargah should permit the Company to resume work at the mines—-any attempt to do so might not improbably result in further confusion. His Majesty s Government, however, see no objection to Robert Wonckhaus removing the red oxide, which has already been mined and is now ready for s ipment from the island. If this proposal as to the removal of the red oxide in question meets with the concurrence of the German Government, His Majesty s Government would advise the Sheikh accordingly, and would arrange for the Indian Government to take whatever step seemed desirable to insure that all proper facilities are placed at the disposal of Mr. Wonckhaus for the removal of the oxide, and to prevent any local friction or conflict between Mr. Wonckhaus and the men of the Sheikh of Shargah.

(No. 560.) &amp;i r &gt; Berlin, December 27, 1907. 1 HAVE the honour to report that I called upon Herr von Schon this morning, and his Excellency informed me that he had sent some documents about the Abu Musa incident to Count Metternich for communication to you. He did not in the least wish to treat this as a political question, and it was* being dealt with in the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office, but the papers had taken it up, and it was perhaps unfortunate that a British gun-boat should have taken an active part in a commercial dispute. I replied that as the German Ambassador in London was goino* to talk to you on the subject I did not propose to discuss it with him, hut I had no doubt that you would be glad to hear that the German Government were not disposed to attach political importance to it. Herr von Schon went on to say that Germany had no political interests in Persia, and gave me to understand that the activity of the German Charge d’Affaires had been by no means agreeable to him, and it would probably be necessary before long to appoint a new German Minister to Tehran. I said that I had heaid that Baron von Richthofen had displayed undesirable activity, not only during the present crisis but also when he had acted as Charge d’Affaires on a previous occasion. Herr von Schon interrupted me by saying that there was another foreign Representative at Tehran who seemed to wish to give himself undue importance, and he could not understand why the French Minister should have put forward a claim to be present with the English and Russian Representatives at the ceremony of the Shah s taking the oath to the Constitution to the exclusion of the other foreign Representatives. It was only natural, in consequence of the special position which England and Russia occupied in Persia, that their Representatives should be present at the ceremony, but if the French Minister were there, there could be no reason for the other diplomatists to be kept away. I said that this was the first I had heard of such a claim being put forward by the French Minister. I knew that he had warmly supported his English and Russian colleagues, and I thought I should have heard if he had sought to obtain an exceptional position for himself. Herr von Schon, however, seemed certain of his facts. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) FRANK C. LASCELLES. [2790 /—l]Minute Paper.

Grey to transmit to you, to he laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a note from the Geman Charg6 d’Affaires, respecting the situation which has arisen in connection with the export of red oxide from the island of Abu Musa. In forwarding this document, I am to draw your particular attention to the statement that the mines in question were the property of the Ruling Sheikh's uncle, Salem-bin-Sultan, end that they were leased by him in his own right and not as representing the Chief of Shargah during his pilgrimage to Mecca in 18S8. This contention does not appear to harmonise with the account contained in the British Resident's letter. No.2794 of November 29th, 1906. The The Under Secretary of State, India Office.The question of ownership may not he easy to determine, hut if it could he established that the annual rent was paid to the Ruling Sheikh and not to his Uncle, such a conclusion would go far to disprove the allegations contained in the German case. ^ In this connection I am to recall to you the opinion expressed in 1903 hy Colonel Kemball, the late Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the effect that the island of Ahu Musa undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasmi Sheikh of Shargah. He added that in summer the sole inhabitants of the island were three men whose duty was to tend the date trees belonging to the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah. While, there fore, the Ruling Sheikh was admittedly the terri torial owner, his uncle possessed landed property on the island, which not improbably included the red oxide mines. The purchase in October 1907 - long after the Sheikh had terminated the concession granted in 1898 - of one share by Messrs Wonckhaus would appear to establish that Mr. Brown and his followers set sailsail from Llngah for Abu Musa on October 22nd, not for the purpose of protecting the oxide accumulated on the shore, hut in order forcibly to exercise Messrs Wonckhaus* newly acquired rights as co-owners in the original concession. It is further to be remarked that the sale to Mr. Brown by Hassan Samaiyeh is dat ed the very day on v/hich the formal notice from the Sheikh of Shargah, directing him to cease work on the island, was served. b Sir E. Grey considers that It would be expedi ent to ascertain the precise wording of enclosures 4d and 4e in the note from the German Charge d*Af faires. The former bears the Impress of an endorse ment rather then of a substantive document. The substance of the German complaint is con tained in paragraphs 5 and 6 on page 3, viz: that the Sheikh of Shargah*6 action concerns Messrs Wonckhaus as partners in the concession, and that their claim lies against the Sheikh as distinct from the other partners in the concession; while in sub stancesubstance it is claimed that Messrs Wonckhaus should now be allowed to work the mines themselves. Any such claim, if admitted, might be held to give the Germans virtual occupation of the island, a consumma tion which, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, is to be avoided. *&gt;&gt; I am to suggest, for the consideration of Mr. Secretary Morley, that it might be advisable to as certain the views of the Government of India upon the note from the German Charg§ d*Affaires; and, in view of the urgency of the question, I am to express the hope that this may be done by telegraph. In the meanwhile Sir E. Grey proposes to inform Herr von Stumm that His Majesty’s Government are examining the statements contained in the German case, and that, pending this examination, they can not agree to the claim of Messrs Wonckhaus to work the mines, since the original concession was can celled before a specific share was transferred to this firm. Sir E. Grey further proposes to add that Messrs Wonckhaus will be allowed to remove all thered oxide which has already been mined and is now ready for shipment; and, in this connection, I am to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India, that a British Representative should proceed to Abu Musa forthwith to be present during the operations, in order to ascertain the precise amount of oxide ready for shipment, since this should be calculated as a set off against any possible claim by Messrs Wonckhaus for loss under the con tract of June, 1906.

Baron von Stumm to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 1, 1908.) Your Excellency, German Embassy, December 31, 1907. ON the 17th instant, the Imperial Embassy gave Sir Charles Hardinge to understand that they were ready to lay before the British Government papers connected with the complaint of the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co., relative to the mines of oxide of iron at Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf. These papers have now reached the Embassy and I have the honour to transmit them herewith, with copies of the inclosures in duplicate. On the assumption that as the action of the Sheikh of Shargah, which has given rise to the German firm’s complaint, took place, as far as can be ascertained, with the help of a British man-of-war and apparently in the presence of a British Consul, the British Government is now, or will be shortly in possession of detailed information with regard thereto, I have the honour to express the hope that your Excellency will communicate in the same open way to the German Government the papers in possession of the British Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) STUMM. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Complaint of the German Firm R. IVonckhaus and Co. against the Sheikh of Shargah. ACCORDING to papers, copies of which are in possession ernment, Salem-bin-Sultan, uncle of the ruling Sheikh of Shar^ _ : n . _ • j _ Tolourl rvf Ann V i of the German Government, Salem-bin-Sultan, uncle of toe rnnng pneum Chalid), is the owner of iron oxide mines on the island of Abu . usa in the Persia Gulf which appears to be included in the territory of the kheikh of Shargah. In 1898 Salem-bin-Sultan by a document (Inclosure 1) leased his iron oxide mine on Abu Musa for a fixed yearly rent to a Company consisting of three British subjects, of whom a certain Hadschi Hassan-ben-Ali Samaye, as the eldest, conducted the affans of the lessors. Company, consisting of the three lessors, admitted the reigning Sheikh oi^Shargah (Segger-bin-Chalid) into the Conipany so that tfie Comjiany of lessors now consisted of four persons ;' lth /^ ua ' ‘^eiem.

H. Gabriel, British Consul at Bander Abbas. . . , „ T&gt; ^ W hen a few days later, after the departure of the British man-of-war, the British subject Mr Thomas Brown, in the employment of the German firm R. Wonckhaus, who are partners in the Company, and later another employe, said to be a German, of the same house approached the island in order to land there, they were compelled to return by shots from the Sheikh’s armed men. By the forcible measures and the apparently in every respect illegal conduct of the Sheikh of Shargah, the Company—and as far as regards their share in the Company the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co.—have been prevented from enjoying ihe lease oranted to the Company by the proprietor of the mines, Salem-bin Sultan, the uncle 'of the reigning Sheikh. The Company is thereby suffering losses since they have entered into contracts to deliver fixed quantities of iron oxide at a fixed price (Inclosures 5, 19). In particular, the managing partner has entered into a contract (Inclosure 5), dated the 1st June, 1906, with the German merchant, Herr Robert \V onckhaus, of Lingah (partner in the above-mentioned firm R. Wonckhaus and Co.), under yhich 2,000 to 5,000 tons are to be delivered yearly, for four years to Herr Wonckhaus from the Abu Musa mines. The Company have also undertaken to deliver 400 tons yearly during five years in India (Inclosure 19). In both cases it is clearly a question of perfectly legitimate business operations as practised all over the world. The documents in possession of the Imperial Government lead them to certain conclusions with regard to the motives wmich have caused this conduct on the part of the Sheikh, in the above-mentioned communications from the Sheikh to the managing partner, Mr. Samaye, it is said :— 1. That the young Isa-bin-Abdul Latif, one of the partners in the Company, had complained to him, the Sheikh, that the contract with Robert Wonckbaus had been concluded without his previous knowledge. This partner and he, the Sheikh, did not approve the contract. Samaye was not entitled without their approval to conclude a contract with regard to the whole production of the mines for a long period. I hey would suffer losses if they approved the contract (Inclosure 12) ; 2. That the Sheikh feared that the mines and the island might be taken out of his possession (Inclosure 16, Confidential, also Inclosure 20) ; 3. That in the lease of lh98 there was no provision allowing the whole production of the mines to be transferred to a foreigner without his approval. The Sheikh is thus speaking as if he had himself concluded the lease of 1898 with the lessors’ Company (Inclosure 22). It is obvious that the Sheikh Segger-bin-Chalid did not conclude the lease of 1898 (Inclosure 1). This was done by his uncle, Salem-bin-Sultan, acting within his own rights, and the Sheikh recognized this by the fact that he himself w r as for a certain time a partner in the Company. It is true that the lease of 1898 contained no provision with regard to the sale of the production of the mines to foreigners. In view of the recognized liberty of trade in the Persian Gulf it is to be inferred from the omission of such a prohibition that the conclusion of contracts with foreigners was without doubt within the powers of the Company, and not the reverse. The contract concluded in June 1906 between the Company and the German Herr R. Wonckhaus, to which the Sheikh refers is, therefore, according to the lease granted in 1898 by the Sheikh’s uncle, absolutely admissible and legally unassailable. The Sheikh’s fear that in consequence of the contract he might lose possession ol the mines and the island is senseless. Apart from the fact that the mines do not belong to the Sheikh but to his Uncle Salem, the contract only grants to Herr Wonckhaus the right to receive at a fixed price during the fixed time of four years the greater part of the production of the mines—an arrangement such as any merchant could conclude when the opportunity offered. The contract does not refer lo the acquisition of the mines themselves or of the Island of Abu Musa, or to any separation of the island from the Sheikh’s territory, and it has no such aim in view. Herr Wonckhaus is a merchant like any other, he is not pursuing any political objects, and in concluding the contract he has only made use of the right belonging to him, as to every merchant, to transact business which appears profitable to him. It is not true, as is shown by the contract of 1906, to say that Herr Wonckhaus has bought the whole production of the mines. But even if he had done so there wouldbe no oblation to a business transaction such as takes place everywhere unhindered. That the contract mi^ht cause losses to the Company, may indicate that it would perhaps be possible tor the Company to conclude a more favourable contract for them selves. It this were the case, there would even then be no legal objection to the contract. It may be the case that the contract was concluded without the knowledge of the Sheikh. Meanwhile theie is no reason why this contract should have required the approval ot the Mieikh, as it was merely a le^al and purely business transaction. It does not appear to be the case that the contract was concluded without the agreement ot one ot tne partners of the Company, Isa*bin-Abdul Latif, as the ” anaging paiter ham aye informed Isas ftther Abdul Latif, who represented his son in all matters concerning the Company, at once of the conclusion of the contract, and the latter approved the contract m his reply (Inrlosure 6). According to a later letter of the faiher, Abdul Latit (Inclosure 8), his son Isa appears to recognize the contract as legally valid, although he would have liked to have seen it before its conclusion, as he describes its abrogation simply as “ preferable,” and in the next letter of Abdul Latif senior (Inclo-ure 10) the latter says definitely that he had originally approved the contract on behalf of his son. ^ Lven if one of the partners desires to attack the validity of the contract of 1906 by stating that it required his consent, which had not been obtained, yet it is impossible to see how this gives the Sheikh the right to abrogate by force the lease of 1898 granted by his uncle Salem. This would appear, therefore, to be a question of a purely arbitrary, and, from the legal point of view, absolutely indefensible proceeding on the part of the Sheikh of Shargah against the lessors’ Company. This illegal action affects directly the German firm R. Wonckhaus and Co. as partners in the Company, and is not a claim raised by the German firm against the other partners in the Company. Their complaint is based on their own rights as partners in the Company, and it will he the Sheikh’s duty to compensate the German partner as well as the other partners in the Company, who are British subjects, for his illegal action. The losses which have accrued to the Company are very considerable, us they cannot evade the obligations assumed by them in the above-mentioned contracts (Inclosures 5 and 19), especially in the contract (Inclosure 5) concluded in 1906 with the German Herr Wonckhaus, which contract appears to have caused the Sheikh to commit his act of aggression. Through this contractfimmediate losses are incurred by the Company, as they have been prevented by the forcible measures ot the Sheikh from delivering 2,000 tons of iron oxide to Herr Wonckhaus which had already been extracted, and which ought to have been shipped weeks ago. Further losses will be caused by the fact that the Company is not in a position to extract at the proper time the quantities of iron oxide which they must keep ready for the deliveries due in the coming months. As Herr Wonckhaus, on his side, has already resold the iron oxide to his shipper, and now in order to fulfil this obligation must buy iron oxide elsewhere at a high price, it is obvious that the loss accruing to the Company through the counter-claim of Herr Wonckhaus amounts to a large sum, and will be greatly increased by any furthei prevention of the working of the mines. The Imperial Government consider therefore that it is urgently necessary to settle the matter at once and think that the British Government will agree with them, in view of the fact that the other partners of the Company, who are suffering equally from Ihe arbitrary action of the Sheikh, are British subjects. In the first place, it will be necessary that the Sheikh of Shargah, in order to avoid further losses, should, without delay, allow the Company to work the iron oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa. Later on it will be necessary to deal with the question of compensation for the losses suffered by the Company. , j x* It will also be necessary to consider whether the circumstance that armed men of the Sheikh’s fired on employes of Wonckhaus who who wished to land on the island requires special reparation on the part of the Sheikh. Mr. Thomas Brown, whose life was seriously endangered, is, as already stated, a British subject, while the nationality of the other employe concerned, who describes himself as a German, requires to be established.

(Inclosure 11.) Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey to Abdul Latif-ben-Abdur Rahman. (After compliments.) . Safar, 1325. 1 have received your letter and noted contents. Regarding the contract witn Germans, which yon say is not, as I have explained before, sale of oxide only, my friend, I am convinced that it is a sale ot oxide only for a certain period, and a certai quantity every year until the contract expires. It is not a leasehold for the islau .1 he agreement and conditions are as follows ; He agrees to take every year a fixed quantity and vve agree to dig it from the mines and deliver it as long as there is oxide just as it has been customary before. From everybody who sells something a sale' contract is taken ; this is not a leasehold once for ever, and you know that neither the Hermans nor anybody else have any power over me; hut perhaps you have been forced to this correspondence. The Germans bought oxide only, nothing else, from the owners ot the leasehold of the oxide mines in Abu iMusa, Hage-ben-Ali Semey and Co. We Ipive ax ranged that it we deliver the oxide in Lungah and pay the transport expenses, he has no objeciions and is quite agreeable, and will not insist on going to the island and possess himself of it. Also you wrote me saying that perhaps I could cancel the contract. I spoke to him about it. He answered : “ It you say that we have intentions with the island, we shall give you a letter that we have nothing whatever to do with it; we have only bought oxide from ihe leaseholders of the oxide mines in Abu Musa for a fixed period, just as other people buy from you. We do a large business with all the merchants on the Persian and Arabian coasts, and have never had trouble with the people. It you do not accept this letter and you want to be released from the contract, all right, pay us for every ton 155., as per contract, and also the advances which we have paid to you ; when you have paid us that, we do not require the contract and shall return it. We insist upon our ri-hts. We are not here to play at doing business, and we work and go in accordance with law.” If you think it advisable, please write to them and explain to them ; perhaps they will meet you. I cannot see my way to do anything contrary to the sale conditions until the contract expires. You are the Lord of the Learned ; you know that I did this knowing that you were agreeable to it. The thing being done, it is better to stop this dispute. When the Germans agree to give you a letter according to your own wish, saying that they have bought oxide only from Hassan-ben-Ali Semey and Co., and have nothing to do with the leasehold or the island, that settles everything. You know that such a sale in one item is not obtainable every day, and we have a large amount invested since the date of the Concession ; until now, who of the partners gave a single penny ? And if we don’t sell, who will give us our monev ? You know that a sale is debarrassing; when it is made it decreases the liabilities of the partners; when there is no sale, the partners must pay whatever the expenses are. After his arrival from Calcutta, Abdulla will close the books and show you everything. Please inform Isa of this. (Signed) HASSAN-BEJS-ALI SEMEY and Co. (Inclosure 12.)

He has sent us the copy of contract existing between you and Robert Wonckhaus, and presents a complaint saying that you have concluded this contract without consulting him, and after seeing it he does not agree to the conditions mentioned in the contract, and I also do not agree to this contract under no circumstances. You have no right to give a contract of such a nature and bind yourself, and possess a third person of all that the mines yield for a long period, without consulting us or informing us at all. As we will sustain a loss by allowing this contract regarding the Island of Abu Musa which is in your hands to continue, and you have acted in this unauthorized manner on our behalf, we have now thought it advisable to withdraw the leasehold from you. Now I inform you by this letter so that you may know that the contract is expired between us, and you have no right to make use ot the mines in Abu Musa. Let this be known.(Inclosure 13.) Hassan-ben-Ali Semey to Sheikh Your favour of this month’s date received and contents noted. Regarding the letter in which Abdul Latif agrees to the contract with the Germans and at the same time warns ns against giving a leasehold or something similar yes, I have not acted contrary to that letter, mid the Germans have nothing to do with the leasehold o that Xd I have only sold oxide of iron. When Abdul Latif received answer to his letter it proved to him that I had not acted wrongly. 1 had only sold oxide of iron. We are responsible for nothing else hut the sale of oxide of iron to the Germans. I ou say that I had stated that I am the owner of the inland ; how could I make such an assertion, as I have taken in lease only the mine of oxide of iron, which is m the Island of Abu Musa, from Sheikh Salem-ben-Sultan, and pay a certain sum as rent to Sheikh Salem every year according to the leasehold. But your statement that I had written that I am the leaseholder, it is right, and sale and management are in my hands. The partners know well, that from the beginning of the Concession the sa e, expenditure management and requirements have been duly looked after by me, and from the date of the contract the entire management has been in my hands and none of the partners have interfered nor had they any right to do so unless I had acted contrary to law. I quite admit that I am a British subject any abiding and do not deserve this unjustifiable interference, and you know that Germans have no other claim but the purchase of oxide for a certain period • and you are well aware that large amounts of our money have been invested in the oxide mines. If we do not obtain sales, how are we to repay the Grermans and others ? So much was necessary. Compliments to all. (Inclosure 14.)

Wonckhaus, the German, asserting that it was made without his knowledge Sheikh Seger also drops a hint that he wishes to withdraw the leasehold for the oxide ol iron mines'in Abu Musa which we leased from ^heikh Salem-ben-Sultan. We being British subjects, and seeing that the letter of Sheikh Seger has no meaning! we thought it necessary to inform you of this before they misrepresent the matter to you. , We hold the original leasehold from the Sheikh Salem-ben-Sultan ot 131o, to be continued for any period we desire ; attested by your agent, Abdul Latif, we accepted Sheikh Seger as a partner with the knowledge and evidence of Abdul Latif. We made known our contract with the Germans and its conditions in Arabic and English to Abdul Latif. Then we received a letter from your agent, dated the Slsl Rebic-el-Thani, 1324, regarding the contract with the Germans ; in that letter he expresses his acceptance and gladness. We beg to inclose the copy of that letter. Also Isa was informed and agreed in the question ; the letter of Sheikh Seger shows that he intends to stop the work and make us suffer a loss, for which reason we inclose copy of his letter before a dispute arises. You are our protectors, and it was necessary for us to inform you, because all our transactions and contracts were made with the knowledge and approval of Isa and Abdul Latif, and the original leasehold with their signatures are in our possession. If Abdul Latif had not approved he would have stopped me in the letter of the 21st Rebic-el-Thani, and 1 have only treated with the Germans with his approval, and in our contract with the Germans we have sold oxide only—a mer chandize is for everybody, the Germans and others. fSicmedl HASSAN-BEN-ALI SEMEY and Co.'

Regarding the complaint lodged with us by Isa-ben-Abdul Latif concerning the oxide in Abu Musa, you mention that your contract with the Germans was made by his and his father’s knowledge, as per letter dated 21st Rebi-ul-Thani, 1324. In the same letter he also warns you against entering engagements resembling a lease or binding yourself in such way as to occasion a row; he further mentions that you should go a sure way, because his officials would not agree to it. The existing contract between you and the Germans, and the condi tions which you have bound yourself to, are altogether contrary to the letter of Isa’s father, which you mention. The reason that we are frightened of your work is that it is not remote that the mines go out of our sphere. We entered into this with you knowing that you are British subjects. We did not tell you to make contracts with strangers from foreign Powers without informing us, and to bind yourself. You have no right to make use of it and write on the head of the contract that you are the owners and possessors of the lease held in Abu Musa. To this we never agree, and you are not allowed to take oxide of iron from Abu Musa Island on the condition which you have made, unless the business is put on a footing of which we need not fear the consequences.

The contract does not contain a clause authorizing you to give the whole output of oxide of iron to one stranger without our consent. Because Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey made a contract without our consent with Robert Wonckhaus in Lingah on the 1st June, 1906, and gave him right of purchase of all this output of the mines in Abu Musa; we informed the said Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey in our letter dated the 9th Muharrem, 1325, corresponding to the 21st February, 1907, that this leasehold, dated the 18th Zilkada, 1315, had expired, and that he had no right to make use of the mines in Abu Musa in future. We learn that, in spite of our prohibition, he still works the oxide mines in Abu Musa and enjoys the profits. On this account we hereby proclaim to the said Hage Hassan-ben-Ali Semey, and demand from him the immediate cession of work in the mines and removal of himself, his employed, and all his mining implements from the Island of Abu Musa within ten days from the date that this notice reaches him.

Foreign Office, i(?c$ . Reference to previous letter: F). 2iy Description of Inclosure.December 27th, 1907. Sir:- The German Press continues to occupy Itself with the Abu Musa Incident, and a great many complaints are raised at what Is called the grasping attitude of Eng- land. In an article entitled the 'Open Door* the Kolnlsche Vblkszeltung, the Rhenish organ of the Centre Party, compares the English attitude towards foreign enterprise in the Persian Gulf with French proceedings in Morocco since the Algeciras Agreement. It complains that German trade and German enterprise are unahle to attempt anything in the Gulf without a cry that English rights are being transgressed. Thus a Dutch German obtained permission to undertake irriga tion works in the territory of the Sheikh of Moham- rnerah and procured the necessary permission fran TehranTehran. The British Government intervened and de clined to allow the Sheikh to open his door to others on the ground that he was under British protection. The case is similar with the question of the exploit ation of minerals. The ordinary person will find it difficult to comprehend how a British protectorate can be held to prevent foreigners to acquire such rights ^in the territory of British proteges. It is not only exaggerated anti-Germans like the editor of the National Review who hold this view, tut also sensible and res pectable papers like the Pall Mall Gazette. It is hard to understand why England should take active measures to prevent German merchants from accjuiring rights from British subjects, such as the exploitation of the oxide mines, which is a purely commercial and in no way political matter. But English opinion re gards it not as a commercial but as a political matter. This view must naturally be combated energetically by the Government in Berlin and England must be shown that she must not threaten and forcibly chase away any non- EnglishmanEngllshiran who establishes a legitirrate business in tne Persian Gulf. Thus the Magdeburg Gazette says, Germany must Insist upon her claim to equal commercial treatment in the Persian Gulf. No one has the right to xorbid Germans to trade in those waters, to estab lish a coaling depot or to acquire an oxide mine tnere. Tne only person who has any say in this mat- ter is the Shah of Persia. The position of England in the Persian Gulf is as follows:- She possesses well known hut still de finitely limited rights of sovereignty. The eastern shores constitute the Sultanate of Muscat, a state over which England acquired a protectorate when France sought to establish a coaling station there. West of Muscat comes the Turkish province of El Hasa, be fore which lie the Bahrein Islands which have been under British protection since 1861. North of El Hasa lies Koweit, that once was foreshadowed as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway, hut in order to prevent this the English took the Sheikh under their protection. ThereThere has however never been any question of Great Britain exercising any rights over El Hasa and the whole of the opposite coast of the Gulf Is Indubitably Persian. Persia is recognized as an independent coun try by all, and in the Anglo-Russian Agreement the spheres of influence of the two countries are carefully defined. Furthermore in. the exchange of notes bet ween the two Coverrments, which took place when the \ Agreement was concluded, it was stated that the coun tries which that instrument were held to affect were only those coterminus with Russian or British terri tory in Asia, and it was therefore not held to be suitable to include a declaration of the paramount interest of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf. Russia may have recognized British interests in the Gulf, but that does not affect other Powers. Russia had no territory there and therefore no interests to surrender. This however does not bind other Powers; nor does the Agreement give England any right over Persian territory. The Eastern shores of the Gulf belong to the central portiony &lt;1^ 'ppy — i portion of Persia In which neither England nor Russia guarantees a preponderance to the other. Abu Musa according to the German view belongs to Persia, and a British warship had no business there fore to interfere with any German undertaking in the island. ■ I have &amp;c., (For Sir Frank Lascelles) (Signed) Granville.CONFIDENTIAL.

I have the honour to inclose a translation of a letter, P u jrJ™ e d m the “Berliner Neueste Nachrichten,” from the firm of Traun, Sturken, and Oo. Herr Sturken, who belongs to the firm of Wonckhaus, who are the traders in question, gives an account of what happened according to his information. The «ni ^ ^ erman Cazette ” has not referred in any way to the matter, but the Cologne Gazette ” has published a telegram from Berlin which seems to be accepted by the press as being semi-official, translation of which I have also the honour to Extract of Letter published in the “ Berliner Neueste Nachrichten ” of December 13, 1907. (Translation.) THE English gun-boat “Lapwing” brought an Arab Sheikh from the Pirate concluded during my stay in the Gulf last year, and drove away the agents of the firm with gun-shots. The object is to get the oxide business into English hands and to deprive the Hamburg-America Line of the freight. For this the English require a third party, viz., the alleged independent Arab Sheikh, who is nothing but an instrument in the hands of his English protectors. While the English press have been lately emphasizing the equal treatment of German trade and German shipping in Mesopotamia, this campaign against a successful German undertaking was carried out under the Arabian flag. The consequence will be a loss, firstly, to the rich native owner of the oxide mines, and, secondly, to German shipping and German trade. (Translation.) FOR some time past English firms have exploited the oxide mines on the islands of the Persian Gulf, and recently the German firm of Wonckhaus and Co. have secured the right to work an oxide mine by leasing an island from a certain Sheikh. It is not impossible that this competition became inconvenient to the English firms who previously possessed a monopoly of this article, and it is therefore not unlikely that they encouraged another Sheikh to advance a claim to the possession of the island; but it is also possible that the Sheikh thought of the matter of his own accord. Whatever the reason may be, he landed with his followers and demanded that the employes of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. should leave the island, in which they had no right. These people, among whom there was no European, appear to have submitted to the Sheikh’s demand without opposition. Nothing is known hero inclose. I have, &amp;c.

In the winter it was usually visited by people from Khan and Shargah for purposes of fishing and grazing In the pearling season these people were in the habit of migrating, and the sole inhabitants remaining were three men whose duty was to tend the date trees belonging to Sheikh Salem, the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah. ,, J be Jcwasmis did not fly a flag on the island, and Colonel Kemball submitted that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to keep his flao* flvins: as a siffn of ownership. o ^ s &amp; This course was approved by the Government of India, and on the 30th April 1903 Colonel Kemball reported that the Sheikh had issued orders to have his fla 0, hoisted. 0 The Government of India at the same time instructed the Resident to furnish his observations on the expediency of advising the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khymah to adopt a similar course in regard to the Island of Tamb, which apparently belonged to that section of the Jowasmis. (In 1888, on the occupation of Sirri, the Sheikh of Shargah had urged that the Persians should be prevented from pursuing a similar course at Tamb.) Colonel Kemball replied that the Persian Government had never asserted sovereignty over the island; that the Sheikh of Shargah, in his existing capacity as 1903 . Ruler of Ras-el-Kbymah, claimed it as an appanage of the Jowasmis of the Arab Coast, urging that it was visited by his subjects on account of the good water supply and for purposes of grazing; that the Sheikh was in possession of documentary Inclosure in evidence, in the shape of three letters from two Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, admitting the Colonel claim of the Jowasmis of the Arab Coast as against that of the Jowasmis of Lingah; S 0 f s t0 f and, finally, that in one of these letters, written in 1877, the Sheikh of Lingah had August 19, conceded that the Persians had no property there, nor any right of interference, save 1888 (see ’ with the consent of the Chief of Ras-el-Khymah.

Meanwhile, Mr. Brown, who had previously^ sent a letter to the Sheikh threatening to send over his own employes to 'protect our property,’ and who it is stated informed persons in Lingah befoie leaving that he intended to plant the German Hag on the oxide mines, proceeded to island m a native boat flying the German flag and anchored off the oxide mines. In spite of repeated warning shouted to him by Sheikh’s guard that he would not be allowed to land he persisted in attempting to do so, and therefore, and as he neared the shore, the guard fired two shots in aim to deter him. On his expostulating at this and assuring them that he only wanted to see how matters stood, the guard allowed two of his men to land and see all they wished and then escorted them back to the boat; after which Brown sailed back to Lingah.
