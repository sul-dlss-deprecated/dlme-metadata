Gardner, Imperial Bank of Persia, held charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate throughout the year. His Excellency Mirza Sir Ahmad Khan Darya Begi, who received the Local Government. ^cnour of an Honorary K. 0.1. E on X ear s day 1920 was Governor of the Gulf Ports till his dismissal in September. Early in August he had received un official intimation of his dismissal and the appointment of His Excellency Mowaqqar-ed-Dowleh, but this was not confirmed till September 20th. A few days later he left Bushire and handed over to the Telegraph Master. Masud-es- Sultan, brother of Mowaqqar-ed-Dowleh, arrived from Shiraz and took over from the Telegraph Master as Acting Governor on November 23rd. Yamin-ul-Mamalik was Karguzar throughout the year and was also Deputy Governor during the incumbency of the Darya Begi, but retired from2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE the scene as sueli when the latter left. There were no si^ns of the advent of His Excellency Mowaqqar-ed-Dowleh up to the end of the year. Salar Mufakham, Finance Controller, left in March and was succeeded by Salar Nusrut who was in turn succeeded by Misrop Khan on June 5tb. The scrutiny by the Residency of Local Government accounts, which started during the war when we were financing the Local Government, was discontinued during the year. Eelations with the Local Government were as close and cordial as usual. His Royal Highness Earman Earma held this position till the middle of Govemor-Generai of Fars. September. He came down to Bushire to receive His Imperial Majesty the Shah in May accompanying him to Mohammerah and was absent from Shiraz about a month. The resignation of His Highness had been anticipated as his unpopu larity in Ears had been growing daily more pronounced. He sent in his resig nation to Teheran openly on September 16th and retired from the Ark. His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk and Nasir-ul-Mulk took upon themselves the duty of keeping order until another Governor-General was appointed. Early in October Musaddiq-us-Sultaneh, Minister of Justice in Mushir-ed-Dowleh's Cabinet, arrived in Bushire from Europe and proceeded up-country en route for Teheran. On arrival in Shiraz he was approached by a committee of local habitants who offered him the Governor-Generalship. Strong representations to the Cabinet in Teheran resulted in his appoint ment and he took over charge on October 9th. His Highness the Earman Earma left Shiraz shortly afterwards for Teheran and was given a great send- off, the South Persian Eifles parading at full strength to honour him. The remains of the Bushire Eield Eorce were withdrawn during April Busbire Force ail( ^ The concentration of the 127th Baluchis, 1 squad 15th Lancers and 35th Mountain Battery from Shiraz and the 117th Mahrattas from Kazerun was completed on 1st April and they embarked during the month. On May 4th Brigadier-General A. H. Drew, C.I.E., handed over to Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. B. Wright, 71st Punjabis, the remnants of the Eorce consisting of headquarters and 1 wing 7lst Punjabis and necessary Supply and Transport and Works personnel in Bushire, and the remainder of the 71st Punjabis in Bandar Abbas, Lingah and Bahrain. Muscat was garrisoned by two companies of the 117th Mahrattas relieving the 2-lst Brahmins in May, and the detachments at Jask and Charbar were found by Muscat. The 7lst Punjabis were relieved by the 2-112th Infantry in December. The beginning of the year found the two rebels Sheikh Hussain and Zair Bushire Hinteria&amp;d, KhidtMr stiU defiant in the field. The Khans of Dashti had met Asaf-ul-Mulk, the Deputy Governor at Khormuj,. and promised obedience, but when it came to the point they refused to listen to his suggestion that they should fight Sheikh Hussain and Zair Khidher. Asaf-ul-Mulk then captured three of them, Hussain Khan, Abdul Humaid and Karim Khan, his method of doing so undoubtedly being not far short of treachery. Then followed a desultory form of warfare between tofangchis assembled by Asaf-ul-Mulk and the Khan's followers, which was supported by bombing from our aeroplanes on a few occasions at the special request of the Deputy Governor. Meanwhile plans for concerted action by the Bushire Eorce and the South Persian Eifles were made to enter the tangled hilly country behind Ahram, the objective of which was either to capture or completely expel Sheikh Hussain and Zair Khidher from the country. The acting Inspector-General, South Persian Eifles, and the Brigadier Major visited Bushire in January, in order to discuss the matter with the General Officer Commanding. The plan was for converging columns from Shiraz to concentrate near Khawiz, the haunt of the rebels, supported by a mixed force from Bushire who were to occupy Ahram. Asaf-ul-Mulk was to draw a screen round the rear of the rebels from the direc tion of Dashti.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY. 1920. This plan for concerted action, however, did not materialize, acj orders were issued by Government prohibiting any action which meant the expen- diturejl of more money or which might possibly lead to further commitments as it had been decided that the force was to be evacuated in the spring Thus the only action taken by our forces was the occasional bombing mentioned above, though the South Persian Eifles advance parties actually left Shiraz. Owing to the reports received of the harsh treatment meted out to the prisoners by Asaf-ul-Mulk and in the hope of encouraging the people of Dashti to come in and make terms, which they would not do to Aeaf-ul-Mulk the latter was persuaded to have the Khans brought into Bushire, and handed over to the Military authorities for detention. The invitation to the Syeds and other leadmg men of Dashti to come and discuss terms, which were the release of jLhans if suitable guarantees for the payment of revenue were forthcoming was not accepted and the Khans were after a month's detention handed back to Asaf-ul-Mulk. The arrival of the Shah and the resignation of Asaf-ul-Mulk in May was •eized as a good opportunity to end an unsatisfactory position. Bv Roval demency the Khans were released and sent back to Dashfci. Later on the inhabitants of Dashti were ordered to choose their Zabit, and Husain Khan having been chosen, was appointed Zabit of Dashti by Salar Nusrat who had succeeded Asaf-ul-Mulk as Deputy Governor. One of the first acts of Salar Nusrat was to turn Mohamed Khan out of Ahram, but as this was done distance of'th^Residerfcy! an money wa3 'appointed at the , , fheikh, Hussain became bold and attempted to capture Chabkutah but failed and remained in a garden near by. His Excellenc/ the Darya Bed tried to organise the tofangchis of the Loc al Khans but faiJed and asked for the help of regular troops. Arrangemwits were made with the South Persian Rifles who sent down a column from Kaserun to reinforce the Borazjun detachment, the column making a remarkable forced march from Kazerun to Boraziun. On the nirfit of July 21-22nd a column of 100 infantry. 50 cavalry and i Austrian gun made a night march from Borazjun and attacked Sheikh Hussain at dawn The attack was completely successful and reflects great credit on Captain Munn the Officer Commanding and the men of the South Persian Rifle. Sheikh Hussain and one of his sons were killed and the rebels' casualties amounted to over 20 killed and many wounded, while the South Persian Rifles casualties were 13 in all, of which 4 were killed and one died of wounds The co-operation of the local tofangehis which had been arranged was conspi- cuous by its absence. Thus one of the rebel Khans was removed and Za r Khidher soon afterwards wrote in to the Darya Begi saying that if he went to Ahram to settle his affairs he would abide by his orders and would allow two of his sons to go into Bushire as hostages. These negotiations were put an end S the Dary e a W Be 0 gi e api,0mtment of ^owaqqar-ed-Dowleh and the dismissal In October Zair Kbidher who had remained quietly at Khaviz came down and occupied the village of Ahram. Mohamed Khan left the fort with a few t0 :Bushlre t0 P lea&lt;1 for support. He was told to go back at one® otherwise he would no longer be supported by the Residencv as Zabit. Meanwhile Zair Khidber made no effort to take the fort. Mohamed Khan hung about Bnshire and did not go back to Abram. Salar Nusrat was then sent to Ahram to put his own representative in the fort so that neither Zair Khidher or Mohamed Khan should occupy it, the Question tn romn :,, rTu-A'! tlle arrival of Mowaqqar-ed-Dowleh in Bushire who would settle the Zabitship one way or the other. Matters remained thus till the end of the year as there was no sign of Mowaqqar-ed-Dowleh moving from Teheran, Mohamed Khan had forfeited all sympathy on the part of the Residency by his pusillanimous behaviour a^d it was recognised that Zair Khidher was the only possible Zabit. There wera no events of any importance m other i arts of the hinterland.4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE On the evacuation of the Indian Troops the whole road was taken over by the South Persian Eifles from Shiraz to Bushire-Shiraz Road. ^ of ^ of Bush i re a n d ^ U is a remarkable fact that during the year there were, with one or two trifling exceptions, no robberies and the road was safer than it has ever been before. The system of road guards inaugurated by the Force was continued by the South Persian Rifles and their numbers were considerably increased. The actual road itself, naturally enough in the absence of repairs, suffered considerably; but South Persian Rifles, Pord Vannette convoys continued all through the year. No changes among the Khans along the road took place. Salar Mohtazid Deputy, Governor of Kazerun, was replaced by Jalal-ul-Mulk at the end of November. On 17th May His Imperial Majesty the Shah on [board R. I.M.S. Lawrence which had been sent to Aden Visit of H. I. M. the Shah. to ^ r - n g to arrived at Bushire about 6 p. m. The Persian vessel the Fersepolis with His Royal Highness the Earman Parma, Qawam-ul-Mulk, His Excellency the Darya Begi and many Persian officials and the Deputy Political Resident on board, accompanied by the Customs ship the Mozaffer and a flotilla of gaily 14 dressed' launches steamed out to meet him. The Persepolit fired a salute of 24 guns, the Shah s age. The sea front was illuminated with electric lights which were most effective and there was a display of fireworks. Next morning His Imperial Majesty landed at old Customs and proceeded in a car to Government house receiving a great ovation from the large crowds en loute. The Parman Parma, Qawam-ul-Mulk, Darya Begi and the other notables escorted the car on foot. Later the Shah received deputations from several communities including one from the British Chamber of Commerce. He left Bushire about 8-30 that evening on the Lawrence for Mohammerah accompanied by His Royal Highness the Parman Parma and other notables. The preparations, illuminations, decorations and enthusiasm of the people befitted such an historic occasion and His Imperial Majesty expressed himself highly pleased with his reception. Shiraz was considerably affected by the news of the landing of the Bolsheviks and the successive changes in Far S shiraz and the Tnbes. Government at Teheran during the year. Though there was much curiosity about Bolshevism there was little open syaipathy with it and in most quarters its dangers were realized. The Parman Parma, after his return from Bushire, as a result of the fall of the Wossugh- ed-Dowleh Cabinet felt his position insecure and his dismissal imminent. In order to combat the local dissatisfaction His Royal Highness formed an Anjuman-i-Malak who he hoped would telegraph a request to Teheran for him to remain Governor-General. He was, however, confirmed as Governor- General and then found the Anjuman-i-Malak an extremely inconvenient institution. The South Persian Rifles during the year confined themselves to training and are now a very efficient force, probably the most efficient Persia has ever possessed in modern times. On August 2nd Lieutenant-Colonel M. H. Lucas, D.S.O., the officialing Inspector-General suddenly died. His death was a great loss to the Corps and was universally regretted by the Persians as well as his brother officers. In November Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. K. Praser, D.S.O., M.C., returned from leave and took over command from Bt. Major Lilley who had been acting. A regrettable incident occurred in November near Kazerun when Captain Knowlesof the 1st Infantry, South Persian Rifles, was ambushed and killed while out pursuing some robbers. The small detachment of men with him acquitted themselves extremely well one man being wounded twice while carrying away his officer's body. In September His Royal Highness Parman Parma resigned and retired from the Ark. His Excellency Mussadiq-es-Sultaneh who happened to be on the spot was then made Governor-General, as has been detailed elsewhere inPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. 5 this report. Mussadiq -es-Sultaneh benefitted from the strong support and advice of the Qawam -ul-Mulk, whose influence throughout Fars is very great. In December Mobamed Ibrahim Parrash Bashi of Nasr Diwan of Kazerun was released. While it was indisputable that lie had taken a leading part in the murder of Wills and Sergeant Coomber at Kheneh Ziman it had proved impossible to secure conviction. He was released on condition that a suitable security was deposited that he did not return to Kazerun and that he took no retaliatory measures against witnesses in the case. After the tribes had migrated to their summer quarters Salar Hishmat Ilbegi suddenly attacked Ayaz Kikha and result of which was the division of the Darashuri tribe again and Nasrullah Khan and Ali Penah claimed most of the tribe. Sardar Ehteshem, however, would not agree to the dismissal of Ayaz Kikha as Kalantar and handed over the money of the tribe to Ayaz Kika and his son. Salar Hishmat was expected to resign in consequence of this but did not do so. This was the only important instance of inter-tribal fighting during the year. During the summer months Sardar Ehteshem lay seriously ill in Ispahan. In September a tentative rapprochement was arrived at between the Qawam-ul-Mulk and the Soulat-ed-Dowleh which consisted of an agreement not to interfere in each other's affairs and the deposit of 20,000 tomans each in the hands of the leading Shroff in Shiraz. Nothing came of this, however, as the money was not deposited. While Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh the Persian representative of the League of Nations was proceeding from Isfahan to Shiraz en route for Geneva all his baggage was looted including his credentials. The culprits were Ayaz Kikha's D irashuris. The Qawam-ul-Mulk accompanied by a party of South Persian Rifles later effected the recovery of the Prince's property. Towards the end of the year endeavours were being made to settle the question of Soulat-ed-Dowleh who in the opinion of the majority of those who carried any weight, was the only man strong enough to be II Khani. There have been no note^svorthy events in Behbehan during the year. Behbehan usua ^ chronic state of unrest and raid and counter raidcontinued during the year. At the end of the year one Agha Baba Khan was sent to Behbehan from Sheraz to look after the work of the elections. Hayat Daud under Haider Khan's good and wise government remains H.y .t Dand .a Lir.wi. sti11 peaceful and contented. His advice in current local politics is frequently sought and as freely given. Agha Khan of Lirawi was perturbed at the advent of Haji Sayed-es- Sultaneh the owner of Lirawi from Europe. This gentleman wanted to sell Lirawi to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, a project viewed with much alarm and dissatisfaction by Agha Khan and Haider Khan but the matter fell through eventually. Rumours that the Bakhtiaris had bought Lirawi were frequent but unfounded. The many changes in the Cabinet in Teheran have not affected Bushire Baahire. ^ l eas ti Bushire being thoroughly self«8centred and quite indifferent to the politics of the far away capital. In the same way the threat of Bolshevism in the ftiorth was merely a subject of idle conversation and nothing more. There is an under current of anti-British feelings which is never very apparent but is none the less there. At the end of December elections took place iu Bushire and out of 5 candidates for the two seats Mirza Ali Kazeruni secured more than half of the total number of votes. This man, who is in Teheran, was notorious during the war as Wassmuss's right hand man, and had been strongly anti-British even before the war. The candidate who secured 2nd place Mirza Mahmud Behbehani was disqualified as under age and Shaikh Abdul Kerim of Shiraz, a man of no note, secured the 2nd seat. The commercial life of Bushire suffered a severe shock in the autumn owing to the bankruptcy of the Qassmieh Company in Shiraz who had a branch here.6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE l and many smaller firms followed suit. Money was very tight and trade slack, the Imperial Bank of Persia being considerably involved. During the latter part of last year and till April of this year considerable Oil Exploration at Daibt-i-QU. activity was shown by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in exploring the oil 4 show ' at Dasht-i-Qil, some distance North of Daliki. Two geologists Messrs Wylie and Richardson and a surveyor Captain Anderson made several journeys in the country round Dasht-i-Qil, the latter individual looking for a suitable road. Later in the year a considerable amount of machinery for the test well and boilers were disembarked and taken by railway to Borazjun. In November another engineer surveyer Mr. Sharpe arrived and proceeded to Dasht-i-Qil accompanied by Hadi Khan Kashquili who escorted the geologists last year. The plans of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, however, are still unknown. The railway continued to run throughout the year with the exception of Railway&gt; a period of three weeks in the spring when owing to engine trouble public traffic had to be shut down. The receipts for the year are. Pawengtr Traffic. Goodi Traffic. Krans 191,276 and Rs. 98. Krans 514,591. It has been a great boon to the merchants and public generally and its removal will be seriously felt. In November orders came from Government to dismantle the railway, as the negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for purchase had failed. The Moin-ut-Tujjar in Teheran tried to promote a syndicate with the Bushire merchants to buy the railway but as not a fifth of the sum asked for by Government was forthcoming the dismantling of the railway continued. As, however, the water for the railway comes from Borazjun, the main line had to be left till the last and public traffic continued, while spare stores were collected and subsidiary lines pulled up. No ship to transport material to India had arrived before the end of the year. During the year several aeroplanes on long distance flights passed through Bushire. All the Italian competitors in the Rome-Tokio race landed at Bushire on their S. V. A. machines viz., Messrs. Ferriaria, Masiero, Captain Gordesco and Lieutenant Grasso and Captain Rauza Eerrucio. Captain Gordesco and Lieutenant Grasso flying together most unfortunately crashed on landing and were instantaneously killed. They were buried next day with full military honours. In addition Captain Mathews on his Sopwith and Lieutenant Mackintosh, both en route to Australia, landed hero. The former had a forced landing 20 miles from Bandar Abbas but was able to proceed in a fortnight's time having repaired his machine which was not badly damaged. Air Vice Marshall Sir W. G. H. Salmond, K.C.M.G., Commanding the Royal Air Force in the middle East, made a tour of the Gulf, after leaving Mesopofcomia, in R.I.M.S. Latorence and landed at Bushire on 4th June. The Royal Air Force flight here was recalled to Baghdad and left Bushire in the middle of September. In consequence of the disturbances in Iraq in the summer it was found ^ V4 . , Tl ^ . T , „ . necessary to deport several seditious Political Deportees from Iraq at Heniam. . i , i. ' v'. ringleaders from Mesopotamia. The most suitable place for these deportees was Henjam, where a small garrison of Indian troops, water and other facilities already existed and a camp was established there in June. The Indian Infantry detachment was increased, and a British Officer placed in command and temporary mud lines were built and early in July the first deportees arrived. The greatest number of deportees at one time was 45. In December some . T - were released and sent back to Basrah. a ™. Tr .sc. leaving 20 still at Henjam. In October when H.M.S. Triad and Bspiegle were free from their engage ments in the Shatt-al-Arab due to the insurrection in Iraq, steps were taken topersian gulf political residency, 1920. 7 try and curtail the activities of the arms traders from the Arabian Coast to the Persian Coast. This traffic in arms though not on a large scale had been continuous for some time owing to the Arabs in the interior getting rid of the stocks of arms captured from the Turks and acquired by friendly tribes from the British during the Mesopotamian campaign. These trickled in a continuous stream across in dhows to the small Persian ports, chiefly from Kuwait and Qatar. The Senior Naval Officer Captain J. L. Pearson, C.M.G., in H.M.S. Triad patrolled in the Southern portion of the Gulf with Headquarters at Henjam and H.M.S. Commander C. Sarel, O.B.E., the Northern part with Headquarters at Bushire. Although a large number of dhows were searched no rifles or ammunition were discovered, but the mere fact of these ships' vigilant patrolling undoubtedly had a marked effect on the traffic. Later in the year a special Intelligence Officer, Major R. F. Francis M.C., from Simla, was attached to the Senior Naval Officer to assist him. During the year H.M.S.

Bunder Abbas. —Sartup Mirza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja Nizam, C.I.E., held the office of the Deputy Governor throughout the year. On 26th May a Eobe of Honour was presented to him by Hadi Khan on behalf of His Excellency the Darya Begi. His attitude bas always been cordial, but complaints of his crrelty and extortion have been frequent, and though many of them were probably inspired by his enemies—especially since the change of Governors in Bushire—there is undoubtedly much truth underlying them. His intrigues to obtain the Deputy Governership of Lingah or Minab for his son, Kohandil Khan, Ihtimad Nizam, have during the latter part of the year given much trouble to His Majesty's Vice-Consul, the occupants of the coveted posts, and the inhabitants of the districts concerned. Lingah.' —Kohandil Khan, Ihtimad Nizam, held office as Deputy Governor up to 16th March, when he proceeded to Bunder Abbas on two months' leave. Nejef Quii Khan acted for him up to 25th May, when Mohamed Eeza Khan, Satwat-ul-Mamalik, was appointed Deputy Goyernor. Ihtimad Nizam's attitude was at first friendly, but latterly he became secretly hostile to His Majesty's Vice-Consulate, while his handling of public funds came under suspicion. Satwat-ul-Mamalik is the son of Soulat-ul»Mulk, Khan of Bastak and he possesses strong influence locally. He is a firm friend of the British, but is not on good terms with any of the Government's departments at Lingah, and many intrigues are in progress to secure his dismissal. Minab. —Kaid Mohamed Ali Khan held the post of the Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas up to the 17th December, when he was summoned to Bushire to answer various charges made against him from Minab. His place was taken temporarily by Mirza Mohamed Shafi, a munshi of the Governor of Bushire, who had been sent to Bunder Abbas to settle the parliamentary elections. Kaid Mohanied Ali is a rough diamond but strongly pro-British. On his arrival in Bunder Abbas His M ajesty's representative was about to visit Minabj12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE and with the approval of the Deputy Governor he took Kaid Mohamed Ali back with him to investigate the case against him. It became apparent that Shuja Nizam was the moving spirit of the intrigue against him, mainlvr because he coveted the place for his son. and partly because Kaid Mohamed Ah s practice of referring matters to the Consulate direct did not meet with his approvaL After remaining a few days in Minab Kaid Mohamed Ali J eft for Eushire.

Bunder Mushir-ul-Ulum has held office throughout the year. He is a very quiet individual, but reputed to be anti-British. At the end of the year he posted a notice in town, which he had received from Bushire, to the effect that all cases between Persian and Foreign subjects should be 'referred to the Karguzar and not as formerly, to the Deputy Governor. He did not inform the latter or His Majesty's representative before puttino- un this notice and no attention has been paid to it. Sayed Hussain, Hisam-us-Sadat, arrived to open the nost of Karguzar on the 27th July, the duties of Karguzar having been discharged bv the Deputy Governor since 1914. ^ He posted a notice similar to that of his colleague in Bunder Abbas and it has received the same degree of attention. He is one of the most active enemies ot the peputy Governor, his previous record is 'democratic' and anti-British, and his attitude since his arrival in Lingah bears this out. F inance D epartment. Bunder ^to.—Mirza Ismail Khan was in office at the be^innmo- of the year, but took bast in the Consulate on 24th February on account of his alleged persecution by the Finance Agent at Bushire. At the beginning of March their differences were temporarily settled, but the post was understood to be up for auction and fell to Mirza Ghulam Hussain Khan, an emplovee of me Customs, who assumed charge on the 1st March. A quarrel arose between Mirza Ghulam Hussain Khan and the Kaimizar regarding the balance of the Opium Department revenue handed over bv the former to the latter and the former was called to Bushire, being relieved bv ^ bas who arrived from Bushire on the 17th October. Mirza Abbas Khan has been on bad terms with the Deputy Governor since his arnva!, one of the main points of difference being the queslion of the nay- ment of the Governor's staff. Mirza Abbas Khan is a very plausible individual but strongly democratic and anti-British. a ' tt - i ^tT^rvi rZa , Kh , a ^ lj a munslli of the ^i^nce Department, acted for The Finance Department was under that of Bunder Abbas until Minab | r0m Lin = ah was pointed to the post in dismissal of orders were received from Bushire for the Minab Den^rfm ? w amalgamation of the Bunder Abbas and returned from R k*' but 0 w , er e subsequently cancelled and Mirza Kbalill eturned&amp;om Bushwe on 2nd Juiy and again assumed charge at Minab.

In reality he was afraid ofthe h s ownend^ ^-T- 11 evoked in the district, and sought to serve amlanHBrt;? ^ Deputy Governor. He is'a democrat ma anti-British and there ^re many stories of his extortions in Minab,PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920, 13 Excise Department. Bundar Ahbas —This Department was administered as a branch of the Malieh until the month of July, when it was handed over to the charge of the. Karguzar. The latter complained that there was a deficit of Tomans 490 in the balance handed over to him and the dispute is not yet settled. On 27th August Amad-i-Daftar arrived from Kerman to take over the department, but as the Karguzar refused to hand it over, he proceeded to Bushire to get authority^ and returned and assumed charge on the 17th October. Lingah. —The department was separated from the Malieh and put under the control of Mirza Jaffer from the beginning of the year. Mirza Jaffer is one of the moving spirits in the intrigue against the Deputy Governor and is a typical democrat. Bander Abbas, Ling ah, Minab. —This year a new tax of 30 per cent, has been levied on all tobacco, whether grown for the consumption of the producer or for sale. The novelty and the extreme severity of the tax has roused the greatest discontent and opposition. The inhabitants of Kalyan in the Minab district deliberately ruined their crop rather than pay such a prohibitive tariff, # and the people of Gurband only paid after some rioting, which necessitated the despatch of armed men to the village by the Deputy Governor of Minab. The duty on tobacco which is to be exported abroad is 25 per cent, and this is collected by the Customs. Customs. Bander Ahhas. —Monsieur Bourgeois was Director of Customs until the 24th March, when he was relieved by Monsieur A. Pourman. The relations between the latter and His Majesty's Consulate have always been most cordial. Carinx K. Keverkian, an Armenian clerk, was in charge of the department until the 21st March, when Monsieur L. Carlier assumed charge. The latter proceeded to Bushire on 10th August leaving Mohamed All to act in his absence. While at Bushire Monsieur Carlier died and Mohamed Ali has remained in charge up to the end of the year. Relations between the Vice-Consulate and the Customs have been friendly throughout the year. Municipality. Bandar Abbas.—'R&amp;]\ Muslim was in charge of the Department through out the year. The department levies a monthly house tax and a toll on all goods entering and leaving the town by land, and the proceeds are devoted to street cleaning, coolie hire, etc. There is a substantial balance in the bank, and a scheme for a better water supply is under consideration. This department is being administered by Kalantar Mohamed Baqir, Aminul-Eiyayeh. He collects a tax of one kran per house from all Persian subjects in addition to the Navakel taxes. No steps have yet been taken to improve this department. Condition op Country. Bandar Abhas and Lingah. —These districts have been quiet and safe during the year. Minab. —Various disturbances have occured in this district, where the proximity of the lawless and inaccessible inhabitants of Biyaban is a con stant menace to the security of the city. In the month of October Haji Kamber Dadi, Kalantar, of Kalyan, the Eastern most district of Minab, was murdered by Faqir Kassim, ex head of tufangchies in Minab, and Mir Yaqub, brother-in-law of Mir Barkat. For a14 administration report of the few days there appeared to be some danger of Mir Barkat attacking Minab but the danger did not materialize. In November Taj Mohamed and two men of Ghulam Shah Tahirzai looted some houses in Kargan, and the Deputy Governor sent tufangchies to cut off their retreat. A fight ensued in which Taj Mohamed's brother was wounded. The robbers took refuge in the house of Abbas Khan, cousin of Mir Barkat, who promised at the time to restore the stolen property, but later repudiated his promise. In November ten Awazis came in from Minab and took bast in His Majesty's Consulate, Bunder Abbas, complaining that a man had insulted the Sunni Religion in the Minab bazaar on the occasion of the death ceremony of the second Khalifah. The object of their complaint was to obtain the dismissal of the Deputy Governor ratber than the satisfaction of any wounded religious susceptibilities. Laristan. —The province enjoyed peace throughout the year. JBastaJc. —Nothing of any importance occurred in Bastak and district during the year. Soulat-ul-Mulk, Khan of Bastak, continued to be loyal to His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk. Shih iTwA.—Quarrels were reported between the followers of Sheikh Mazkur Khan of Gaobandi and Sheikh Ibrahim Hammadi early In the year but peace was made afterwards. Condition of Roads. Bandar Ahhas District, —No robberies of any importance have been reported during the year. One caravan bound for Kerman with goods belono-- ing to Mr. Wetli wa^ robbed in the Tangi Lambi near Gakhum on the early- morning of the 16th November. Nine camels, seven with, and two without, loads, were said to have been stolen. Lingah District. —The road between Lar, Bastak and Lingah was safe for caravans throughout the year. Minor robberies by the Nafar robbers were reported between Bastak and Lar. About 17,060 donkeys and 4,410 camels left Lingah for Bastak and Lar with piece goods, sugar and kerosine oil during the year. Arms Traffic. It was reported on May that a Baluch named Mobin bin Mubarak had bought about 400 riflles at Dubai in April and had taken them by a boat especially brought from Sajieh, near Jask, to Shihran. Prom there it was believed that the smuggled rifles would be conveyed by camels for sale in the interior. The Residency Agent, Shargah, was asked to make enquiries, but the report was received too late for any effective action to be taken. Late in December three Khuristanis came into Bunder Abbas with the Government rifles. Two of the men were caught and severely punished by the Deputy Governor, but the third, a well known criminal, escaped. The rifles were confiscated and deposited in His Majesty's Consulate. Shipwrecks. A sailing boat 'Mahmoodi' owned by [Thaiardas Yalji Pardan of Catch Mandvi grounded off Bustaneh in October. Almost all the cargo was salved and the boat beached. Bandar Abbas-Kerman Telegraph Line. No oases of wilful damage to the telegraph line have been reported during the year. In October a Persian Telegraph Superintentent named Cyrus arrived from Kerman and opened a Persian Telegraph Office in the town. On 30th November a loop line was complete linking up the Indo-EuropeanPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. 16 Telegraph and Persian offices. On 5tli December the Indo European Tele graph Department acting on instructions from Teheran stopped accepting all traffic for the interior except Political and Military Messages. Aviation. Two British and three Italian aeroplanes arrived at Bandar Abbas during the year. The aeroplane in which Captain Mathews of the Royal Air Force Corps was flyins: from Bushire to Karachi made a forced landing at Bustaneh about 20 miles from Bandar Abbas on 3rd February. Captain Mathews came into Bandar Abbas with a local guide the same day. Captain Mathews accompanied by the Officer Commanding Station, Bandar Abbas, and His Majesty's Consul, left on the launch ' Karanja ' for scene of the accident to bring in the machine and ascertain what could be done to salve it. After effecting temporary repairs Captain Mathews flew in from Boataneh on the 19th and left for Charhar on the 23rd after necessary repairs. In June, Vice Air Marshall W, G. Salmond, Commanding 'Royal Air Force, Middle iEast, Cairo, arrived by E. I.M.S. 'Lawrence II' and inspected the aviation ground. He sanctioned the construction of rooms for keeping a stock of petrol, which were completed in the month of September. A small Wireless Installation of 250 Volts has also been constructed in the month of June, and is intended for aviation purposes only. His Majesty's Representative received a telegram from Karachi from the two Italian aviators Ferrarian and Masiero thanking him for the reception and assistance they received at Bandar Abbas. Lieutenant Biancalani, the Italian Aviator stationed at Bandar Abbas, also thanked His Majesty's Representative for the assistance given his colleagues and added that he had telegraphed to his Government drawing attention to the assistance given his countrymen by the British authorities.

Wilson, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., D.S.O., the Political Resident ia the Persian Gulf and Lieutenant-Colon el A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., the Deputy 'Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived on the 30th October and left the same evening. Lingah. —Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived by R.I.M.S. ' Lawrence ' on the 12th April. British Indian Troops. On the 12th May the detachment of the 120th Infantry consisting of two British Officers, four Indian Officers and 165 other ranks including public aad private followers was relieved by a detachment of the 71st Punjabis con sisting of one British Officer, one Indian Officer and 68 other ranks including public and private followers. One double company of 2-112th Infantry, which arrived by S. S, ' Bandra' on the 3rd December, relieved the detatchment of the 71st Punjabis the same day. Garrisons for the Baghdad Political Deportees Camp at Henjam and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's settlement at Kishm, are supplied from Bandar Abbas. Political Prisoners. An Internment Camp for Political Deportees from Mesopotamia was established on the Island of Henjam in July, a guard of Indian Troops under a16 administration report of the British Officer being furnished from Bandar Abbas. The deportees were sent from Baghdad in separate batches, the 1st batch arriving at Hen jam during July. When aU had arrived the total number of the deportees was 49. Of these one, Mirza Mohamed B.eza, son of the Chief Mujtehid, was released and left for Kerman on the 9th of August, and one, Sayed Ahmed Sayed Salman, died of heart-failure on the night of 10th November. The arrangements for the construction of huts, food, and other work in connection with the deportees were entrusted to Contractor Khan 8aliib Ebrahim Gelladary. Food was supplied at a charge of Rs. 4 per prisoner per diem. Slave Tbaffic. Bandar Abbas. —Pourteen slaves took refuge at His Majesty's Consulate during the year, out of whom seven were given manumission. Lingah. —Only one slave took refuge at the Vice-Consulate during the year, who was manumitted. Trade and Commerce. Bandar Abbas. —Statistics are not obtainable, as the Customs year ends on 21st March, but the number of exports and imports appears to be less than in 1919. Import Revenues from March to December amounted to Krans 37,355,233 and Export to Krans 12,210,808. The new tariff revised by the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1920 has yielded 100 per cent, more than the old tariff for imports and 50 per cent from exports, but one-third of the increase in import revenues is due to a temporary Surtax ' of one kran per batman (6 lbs.) on sugar. The amount of exports is about one-third of that of imports, main exports being dried fruits, carpets, assafotida, and gum tragacanth, main imports sugar, tea, rice, piecegoods and kerosine oil. Lingah. —British Iniia Steam Navigation Company's steamers maintained the subsidiary mail service throughout the year, steamers calling weekly on the up trip and fortnightly on the down. Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Com pany's steamers called at this port on seven occasions during the year. Owing to the shipping facilities there was a marked increase in imports and exports of the port during the year. # Weather. There was a very heavy fall of rain on the night of the 20th January. There was a heavy storm accompanied by hail on 11th March. It hailed for about 15 minutes and hall stones were so large that window panes were smashed in several houses. The weather during the end of July was exceptionally warm and damp. Nights had been most trying and sleep on occasions had been almost an im possibility. During the beginning of December the weather had become very much colder and sandstorms had been frequent. It was said to be colder than at any time last year. There were two falls of rain, but neither of them was heavy enough to be really beneficial. Anglo-Persian Agreement. The delay in, and latterly the improbability of, the ratification of the Agreement has had a very bad effect locally. All the Persian officials in Bandar Abbas and Lingah, except the Deputy Governors, being always anti- British have been encouraged to show more open hostility than they dared to evince before, and the dismissal of His Excellency the Darya Begi has given them still greater confidence.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. 17 The course of events in the North, as interpreted by these officials, appears to be alienating the sympathies of those who used to be lukewarm friends, while our policy of retrenchment and withdrawal to something like a peace time establishment naturally lends itself to misinterpretation. It is reported that a pro-Bolshevik and philo-American movement is gaining ground in Bandar Abbas, but this appears to be mainly confined to official circles and those connected with them, as the majority, especially the poorer classes, in town and district are too well aware of the value of our presence to themselves, and of what the aftermath of our departure would be, to wish for any change. Mujliss Election. In spite of repeated instructions that the election should be held, no Result had been reached by the end of the year. The Election Committee resigned once as a protest against the number of intrigues in progress. Orders were received from His Excellency Mowaqqar-ed-Douleh in Tehran that the return of Mirza Mahomed Bagher, Dast Grhaib, a noted Shiraz democrat,, should be secured, if possible. Mirza Mahomed Shafi, a Munshi of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, was sent from Bushire to Bandar Abbas and Minab to complete the work of the election, but he was not successful in doino- so and remained in Minab as Acting Deputy Governor. South Persia Rifles. Captain Brannon was in command of the Bandar Abbas detachment throughout the year. 1 he total strength of the detachment has at no time ex ceeded that of a company, and has often fallen far short of that number. Personnel for four road posts and periodical convoy escorts have to be found by the detachment. About 100 recruits, mainly drawn from the districts of Minab, Shainil, Gohra and Bandar Abbas, were enrolled during the year and about 100 men discharged on completion of their three years' contract. As a general rule, only those with prospects of speedy promotion have renewed their contracts of service.^ There are practically no Baluchis left, the resignation of the only Baluchi Officer on account of age being probably the main cause of the Baluchis being unwilling to renew their contracts. A shortage of Persian Officers is one of the main difficulties with which the Officer Commanding has to contend. ° A Convoy Office and Supply Dep6t was inaugurated during the vear and put under the charge of a British Warrant Officer. t&gt; rk^.^^-ColoDel Eraser, D.S.O., M.C., Inspector General of the South Persia Kifles, halted for one day early in November on his way to Bushire and inspected the detachment. 1 The ' Karan ja ' was in use until December, when she was replaced bv a motor boat. 1 J British Interests.

From May to September the work was connneato widening the bore from 2,502'. At the end of the year the well was still apparently in petroliferous series. The Drilling staff changed during the year. Mr. McCall went home in April on expiry of his agreement, and in the same month Mr. Perkins met with a serious accident, so that the works were left for 3 weeks without a driller. In October owing to illness the only driller was inTalided to Bombay complpment ^ t ™ e SinCe April t,le drillill g sta£f tad its fulladministration report of the 18 Other causes for cessation of work were shortage of fuel, breakages to tools and the long distance from the base of supplies.

This continued until the end of May, when owing to the large stocks held by the b izaars, the tightness of money, and the rise m erehange, reaction set in and complete stagnation prevailed until the middle of August. About this time several large caravans of specie arrived from the interior, Kran exchange was remitted freely from Kerman and Sirjan, aud rupee exchange again became in good demand. Owing to the rise in price of sugar a large speculative business was done in that commodity, in which considerable sums were lost and made. Pieceo-oods were again imported and a strong demand for exchange con tinued until the end of November. The scarcity and the rise m value of exchange then began to make itself felt. Merchants speculated freely on a fall in exchange which did not materialize and conditions rapidly became worse, culminating in the financial crisis at the end of December. Money, though apparently rather tight throughout the year, was always forthcoming, and drawings on Kerman, Sirjan, Yezd, and to a smaller extent Teheran and Shiraz, were consistently well met. Business generally has been brisk as compared with the previous year. Mr. W. J. D'Alton was manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia up to the 13th February when he was relieved by Mr. D. Sandes, who remained m charge till the end of the year. Quarantine and Medical. Bandar JAssistant Surgeon H. G. Berlie was m charge until the 13th July, when he was relieved by Assistant Surgeon D. L. Mackay, i.M.U., who remained in charge till the end of the year. The Bandar Abbas Charitable Dispensary was formally opened in the presence of a largo representative gathering, including the Deputy Governor, on 30th January. 4,279 cases attended the Dispensary during the year, as compared witli 3 673 in 1919 and 3,889 in 1918. The increase in attendance ot patients this year may be attributed to the opening of the new Charitable Dispensary, which has ample accommodation and equipment. In some instances cases have been brought in for treatment from distant places, including the Islands of Kishm and Hormuz. The following table gives the prevailing diseases during the year : Diseases of the Digestive System 482 521 618 271 217 « . E J e ... Malaria Fevers of uncertain origin . Dysentery ...... Two deaths occurred among the out-patients but were not attributable to the above mentioned diseases. One death was due to Puerperal bep i Intoxication, and the other to Pneumonia.r I I f i i 1 PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. Epidemics. —An epidemic of small pas appeared in town early in the year, and also in the surrounding villages and the island of Kishm. There were a large number of cases but only 16 attended the dispensary for treatment. Only 273 persons submitted to vaccination. Sanitation of the Owing to the work of the Municipality there has been a slight improvement in the sanitation of the town. The recent erection of new caravanserais has done much to relieve the congestion during the caravan season. There is no system of drainage, and conservancy measures still require to be introduced. Lingah. —Assistant Surgeon J. G. Johnstone held charge of the Charitable Dispensary and Quarantine duties up to 18th May when he was relieved by Assistant Surgeon A. T. Eudson, pending arrival of Assistant Surgeon C. W. Dunlop. The latter arrived on 28th May and took over charge on the 30th. Assistant Surgeon C. W. Dunlop remained in charge till the end of the year. Economic Conditions. Bandar Ahhas and Lingah. —The cost of living in 1920 has been higher than in any previous year, and the poorer sections of the community have ex perienced the greatest hardship. The two main causes of this state of things appear to be the restriction on exports from India, and the greatly increased rates in the Customs Tariffs.

The charge of His Britannic Majesty's Consulate was held by Lieutenant- Colonel P. McConaghey, C. I. E., until 5lst January, when he was relieved by Major A. J. H.

H Grey held charge of the post of Yice-Consul till the 31st January from which date Khan Sahib Abdul Alim act* d as Vice-Consul for the rest of the year in addition to his other duties. In the Gazette of India of 5th June Khan Sahib Abdul Alim was granted the title of Khan Bahadur. Political History. Tersian Officials.~'R\&amp; Excellency Abul Patch, Tabatabai, Hishmat-ud- Dauleh, who had been Governor-General since January 1918 was informed by the Prime Minister on the 14th January Govemor-Generai- th a t Ja'afer Quli Khan, Sardar Assad, Bakhtiari, had been appointed Governor-General and asked to submit his resignation. This he did on the 16th January and he left for Tehran on the 2nd Pebruary making over acting charge of his office to Sardar Nusrat; Genuine regret was felt at the departure of Hishmat-ud Dauleh who was popular with all classes and whose administration had on the w r hole been satisfactory and considerable uneasiness was expressed at the appointment of a Bakhtiari who, it was anticipated, would follow the rapacious example set by former Bakhtiari Governor-Generals. On the 16thL March Amir Mu'tamid arrived from Tehran and took over the acting Governor-Generalship from Sardar Kusrat. A month later Sardar Assad reached Kerman accompanied by Ins two brothers Amir Jang and Sardar Bahadur, Saif-us-Saltaneh, Prince Mufakhar-us-Saltan eh and a Medical attendant named Ahya-ul-Mulk. Sardar Assad had given assurances both to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, while his appointment to Kerman was under consideration, and to His Majesty's Consul cn his arrival at Kerman, that he intended to work in com plete harmony with His Majesty's Consul, appoint no Bakhtiari Deputy Go vernors to Districts and keep a firm hand on his Bakhtiari following and prevent them from pillaging the country as had been the custom of the followers of former Bakhtiari Governor-Generals. These assurances he has, on the whole, carried out and his relations with the Consulate and South Persia Kifles have been friendly and cordial. He has refrained from making any change in the Governorships of Bam, Sirjan and Baft, has maintained friendly relations with the influential Vakili and Sheikhi families and has been no more rapacious in his demands than his predecessors. He is however weak in character and is not much respected or feared. Amir Mu'tamid discharged the duties of Deputy Governor from the date ^ ^ of Sardar Assad's arrival until his death eputy ovemor. which occurred in July, thereafter Prince Mufakhar-us-Saltaneh received the appointment. He is a colourless individual with little character or energy and verj much under the thumb of the Governor-GeneraLn administration report of the Amir Jang has in reality discharged the duties of Deputy Governor and is invariably employed by th« Governor-General in any matters that he does not deal with himself. Sardar Nusrat has held the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Provincial Military Department. Arai y ^ throughout the year. The most , inspected and influential notable in the Province and a firm friend of the British, he has always been consulted by His Majesty's Consul regarding local feeling and views and his advice in these matters has been most useful. He is* tlje recognised head of the conservative or moderate party and has, when necessary, exerted himself to keep this party alive and combined and in a position to thwart the machinations of the 4 Democrats'. His relations with the Governor-General have been excellent. He re ceived a C. B. E. in March 1920. Mujallal-us-Saltaneh has held the appointment of Karguzar throughout KarguzarI the year. He has been helpful to the Consulate in the settlement of claims and has refrained from Political intrigue-and maintained good relations with the Governor-General and other Persian Officials,. In March two important Hindu claims were settled through the Karg|^^'i, and compensation amount ing to about Krans 205,000 recovered. The claims were on account of two consignment? of goods belonging to Hindus entrusted to Sirjan and Qaleh Askar jilaudars at Bandar Abbas. The jilaudars reported that the caravans had been attacked by Farsi robbers en route who carried aw r ay all the loads. It was ascertained however that only a portion of the goods had been robbed and the remainder had been concealed bv the jilaudars in their houses. The jilaudars were arrested and compensation for practically the full amounts of the claims recovered from them. In November Mujallal-us-Saltaneh made over charge of his office to his assistant, Mirza Habibullah Khan, and proceeded to Tehran on four months* leave. The object of this visit to Tehran being to try and induce the Persian Foreign Office to grant him some increase in salary which is only Tumans 150 per mensem. The annual budget allotment of the Qarasuran Department is Tumans QaraBUran Department. 64,290 which IS Supposed to be expended (Road v&gt;uard«.) on the upkeep of 425 men for the pro- n .t teciion of the trade routes of the Province. It has.however for years been customary for the whole of the allotment to find its way into the pockets of the Governor-General, the head of the Qarasuran Department and the Deputy Governors of the various districts. Ihe road guards were empowered to levy tolls ( called rahdari ) from the caravans pass ing over the roads under their protection part of which they retained in lieu of pay and part they remitted to the Provincial capital to form a further perquisite of their Chief. These profitable arrangements were rudely upset in April by a tele gram to the Financial Agent informing him that the Qarasuran Department had been abolishid from the commencement of the Persian financial year ( 21st March ) and ordering him to make no more payments on this account. The Persian Government however failed to issue any orders to the Governor- General informing him of the abolition of the Department and ordering him to disband the road guards. The Governor-General was not slow 1o realize the opportunity thus afforded him of lying low for a few months and then demanding the pay and if any difficulties were raised replying that the Depart* ment had been maintained in default of orders for its abolition. In June the Gqvernor-General commenced to agitate and was informed in reply that the payment of the Qarasuran budget would be considered w p hen the custom of levying rahdari was abolished in the province but until this illegal exaction was stopped there appeared to be no reason for paying the road guards as it was well known that they in no case received any pay and lived upon the rahdari.f- i persian gulf political residency, 1920. 03 The Governor-General bestirred himself forthwith and issued orders abolishing rahdari throughout the province in the second week in July and posted some of his Bakhtiari sowars on the more important trade - fcftites to see that the orders were carried out. The Persian Government after some half-hearted at temp's to reduce the Qarasuran allotment finally gave way to the pressure brought to bear by the Govern or-General and sanctioned the payment of the allotment at the old rate from the date of the issue of the Governor-Generars notice abolishing the levy of rahuari. Further endeavours on the part of Sardar Assad resulted inianction being given for the payment of the allotment for the period from the commence ment of the Persian financial year till the date of the issue of the notice. The Govern or-General saw that his orders were carried out and from the second week in July until the close of the year no tolls were levied from caravans. The charge of the Department w 7 as held by Amir Shaukat until July when he was removed by the Governor-General who himself assumed charge. In October Amir Shaukat was reinstated and continued in charge until the end of the year. The charge of the Ptevenue Department has been held by Baji Iz-ul- Mamalik throughout the year. Owing to the fact that the revenue grain had been purchased during 1919 Financial .nd Revenue Department. ^ the Governor-General at absurdly low rates and that the revenue for 1920 had been anticipated to a large amount to meet three months arrears of salaries accumulated during 1919, the year-opened with a deficit of between 35 and 40 thousand Tumans. Vain appeals to Tehran for funds elicited an order to the Financial Agent to put off the evil day by meeting current demands by drafts payable from the revenue due on the spring harvest. This was done and the Financial Agent was ableio struggle through to the close of the English year meeting all the demands made - upon him by the various departments of the province. A halfrhearted interest was evinced on several occasions during t^e year by the Finance Ministry in the finances of the province and the Financial Agent was requested to Submit proposals for, Teduction of expenditure. This he did but no action was taken to stop the sources of waste that he pointed out. The main sources of wa^te are the Qarasuran, Army Department and Governor- General's sowars which between them absorb two-thirds of the revenue of the province. At least half the money spent on these three departments could be saved without detriment to the security of the province. Ihe revenue which amounts to about Tumans 300,000 per annum could be increased by a modern land revenue settlement and tha province could with little elfort yield a substan tial surplus for remission to the Capital. The Governor-General was, through the effoits of the Financial Agent backed by His Majesty's Consul, prevented from meddling in the disposal of revenue grain and the old practice vas reverted to of collecting and storing in the am bars of the Revenue Department the grain collected from the districts situated near to Kerman. This grain, amounting to about 1000 Kharwars, was held until the close of the year, and the fact that this large amount was generally known to be in store and could at anv moment be thrown on the market had an excellent effect in regulating the price of bread and preventing the formation of land-owners rings and artificially raised prices. The revenue grain from the more distant district was sold by tender in the early autumn at favourable rates. Haji Iz-ul-Mtoalik waf sucessful in recovering the land revenue practically in full.and jWie arrears outstanding at the end of the year were negligible. He is, so far as His Majesty's Consul has been able to judge that rara avis —an honest and conscientious Persian official and has the true interests of liis country at heart. He has by the exercise of tact and moderation main tained cordial relations with'his grasping fellow officials.24 administration report of the Kafi-ul-Wizara administered the Opium Department tlironghout the year. The opium contract to Toumaniantz was Opium Department. ( ancolled in July and the office thereafter became a Persian Government department. Daring the Toumaniantz contract the Government tax was 14 shahis per miscal and the net income of the department amounted to about Tumans 25,000 per annum. On the Persian Government reassuming the direct administration of the department tbe tax was raised to 21 shahis per miscal and wholesale smuggling took place with the result that the income was only just sufficient to pay the administrative expenses of the department and i\o surplus was available for remission to Tehran. In November the Navaqil (octroi) and tobacco regie were transferred from the Bevenue to the Opium Department. It is estimated that if it were possible to collect the tax on all the opium grown in the province the net annual income of the department would exceed Tumans 200,000. Bafi-ul-Wizara is an incompetent and dishonest official who derives an excellent income by shutting Lis eyes to the smuggling that takes place and has no desire to see any change in the corrupt administration of his depart ment. A tobacco regie office was opened in February under orders from the capital and Muhtesham-ul-Mamalik, the son of T.bacco Department. Amir Shaukat, a languid youth with no qualificat'ons except that of being the son of a local grandee, appointed agent. The usual outcry at the imposition of new taxation was raised when the rules were notitied and telegrams of protest to the capital produced an order that stocks of tobacco in the hands of merchants at the time of the publication of the rules were to be exempt from taxation. The charge of the Department of Education and Religious Bequests was held by Sheikh Yahva until November Department of Education and Religious Beque.^B. resigned. ' A clerk ill the Department held temporary charge pending the arrival of the new incumbent, Mirza Beza Khan, who however had not reached Kerman up to the close of the year. Justice. —Mirza Abdul Bahim Khan administered the department during the year under review. Elections — In September the local Democrats, encouraged by the Prime Minister's communique to the Tehran press, made a final and vigorous attempt to upset the elections completed last year. They prepared and despatched long telegrams from the town and districts protesting that the moderate delegates had been elected by means of bribery and undue influence exerted by the large land-owners on their tenant*' and followers. These efforts failed and in response to an urgent summons from the capital the last two deputies from the province left for Tehran in November. Democrats. —Owing to the presence of the South Persia Bifles afid the security and good order thereby secured, the Democrat or Extremist party has had tittle opportunity for activity, and has confined its energies to holding seditious meetings and giving currency to malicious and false rumours cal culated to bring discredit upon the British and the Moderate party. In March the murder took place in Bawar of a certain Sayed Mustafa who during the elections had been prominent in securing the election of the Moderate candidate of that district and had in consequence incurred the enmity of the local Democrats. There was conclusive evidence that the crime was a political one and was instigated by a certain Abbas Khan Nakhai, the leading Bawar Democrat, and carried out by five of his servants but, owing to the energetic act ion taken by the Kerman and Bewar democrats and the expenditure of large sums by them in bribes to the Adliyeh and other officials, the criminals were acquitted. The endeavours of the Democrat party to upset the elections has been noticed under ' Electionsv ■k PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. 2 5 Districts.—The understanding that existed between His Majesty's Consulate and the former Governor-General that no change should be made without His Majesty's Consul's concurrence in the Deputy Governorships of Aqta Afshar, Sirjan and Bam Narmashir was renewed with Sardar Assad on his arriyal. The Governor-General consulted His Majesty's Consul in making appointments to other less important districts also. Mirat-us-Sultaneh, son of Sardar Nusrat, held the post of Deputy Governor Aqta Afshar. £ this district throughout the year. His administration was satisfactory and he maintained good order. The district is a most important one as through it runs the main caravan route to Bandar Abbas and it contains the summer and winter quarters of the powerful Afshar tribe. In May the leading Sardars of the Afshars petitioned the Governor-General and His Majesty's Consul for the removal of Hujabr-us-Sultaneh from the Ilkhaniship and the appointment of Salar Ashayir in his place. Hujabr-us-Sultaneh who is weak in character and addicted to opium had gradually lost his influence with the tribe and it was evident that a change was desirable. After careful consideration and having satisfied himself that the appointment of Salar Ashayir to the Ilkhaniship was desired by all four sections and would not cause a split in the tribe, the Governor-General with the concurrence of His Majesty's Consul made the appointment. Salar Ashayir administered the tribe well up to the close of the year and no robberies were committed by them. Mirza Mahmud Khan, Tabatabai, held the Deputy Governorship through- Sir . , out the year. He continued io be most helpful to the South Persia Eifles detach ment in Saidabad and maintained good order in his charge. The Buchaqchi tribe was quiet throughout the year under the chiefship of Murad Khan, Shikup-us-Sultan brother of Hussein Khan who remained in Tehran. A In September the Persian Government requested His Majesty's Minister to concur in permission being given for Hussein Khan's return to Kerman. His Majesty's Consul suggested that he should be permitted to return only on the understanding that he should reside in Kerman city and refrain from interfering with the Buchaqchi tribe. This was agreed to by the /ersian Government but up to the end of the year he had not left Tehran. Ko change was made in the Governorship of this important district Bam and Xarmashir. during the year and it continued under the able administration of Sardar Majullal, the most enlightened and intelligent of the Deputy Governors of the province. Sardar Majullal is a staunch friend of the British and his relations with the Consulate continued to be of the most friendly nature. He received a C. B. E. in March. The district has suffered little from Baluch incursions, thanks to the restraining influence of British troops and levy corps in Sarhad and Eastern Persian Baluchistan and the maintenance of a South Persia Rifles detachment in Bam. The only robbery of importance that occurred was one in which 120 camels under South Persia Eifles contract were robbed at Dolikhan in April. Through the good offices of Sardar Mujallal 83 of these camels were eventually recovered and returned to their owners. This district has continued under the semi-independent rule of Zargham- endbar. us -Sultaneh. The Zargham pays about , , . ^ . balf the revenue assessed upon the district ana retains the remainder nominally as pay for himself as Deputy Governor, rorpay of revenue collector, upkeep of road guards, etc., etc. He never visits Kerman and only carries out such orders of the Governo^- Hxeneral as happen to suit his convenience.26 administration report of the -1 Notwithstanding this unsatisfactory attitude towards the authority of the Persian Government the Zargham is a capable ruler, maintains good order and preyent robberies. No steps were taken during the year to re-establish the authority of the _ . Persian Government in this district and Persian Baluchistan. •, i j • -i to i i i it has continued as betore under the independent rule of its various chiefs. The most influential of these, Mir Bahrain Khan of Bampur, on two occasions showed a desire to open up relations with the Governor-General and proposed that he should be recognized as Deputy Governor of Baluchistan and supported with a force of 200 Sarbazes and 2 guns. The Governor-General replied inviting him to meet the Deputy Governor of Bam at Bam or in Narmashir to discuss matters but the meeting had not taken place up to the clo'se of the year. As already noted no Baluch raids into Narmashir took place during the year. The remaining district Governorships were held as follows Hqfsinjan. —Rukn-us-Sultan and Zargham-us-Sultan. Khahis. —Mukhtar-ul-Mulk, head of KhanzadH family. Bawar. —-Nusrat-ul-Mamalik. Jiruft. —Muhtashim-ul-Mulk. * Jahal Bariz. —Adl-us-Sultan, brother of Sardar Nusrat. Bardsir. —Hishmat-us-Sultan and Asaf-ul-Mulk. Condition of Roads. * The main routes in the province are— (1) Bandar Abbas to Kerman via Gakum and Saidabad. (2) „ „ „ „ „ Daulatabad and Baft. (3) „ „ „ ,, „ Rudbar and Jiruft. (4) Kerman to Yezd via Bahramabad. (5) „ „ Meshed via Rawar and Naiband. (6) „ „ Bam. 1. Bandar Ahhas-Gakuni'Sftidahad-Kerman. —This route is rarely used by other than South Persia Rifles convoys owing to its length and the scarcity of supplies and fodder. The Saidabad-Kerman section was kept in repair and fit for motor transport but no work was done on the Bandar Abbas-Ab Mar section which hafd formerly been passable for motors and which is now washed out and unfit for wheeled traffic.' The headquarters of'the 2nd Infantry remained at Saidabad during the year and detachments were provided from this regiment at Bandar Abbas and various points between Bandar Abbas and Saidabad. No robberies of any importance took plabe on this road during the period under report. 2. Bandar Ahhas-Daulatabad-Baft-Kerman. —This route which is the shortest and best supplied is the one generally used by merchant caravans except during the month or two that the passes are blocked by snow. Owing to the maintenance of small parties of South Persia Rifles levies at important points along the route and the stern measures taken during the autumn of 1919 by Qawam-ul-Mulk for the punishment of the Pars robber bands who had been in the habit of raiding this road, no robberies occurred. 3. Bandar Alhas-Budhar-Jiruft-Kerman. —This route which is used when the Daulatabad-Baft road is closed and to a certain extent at other times of year has also, thanks to the good order maintained by Zargham -us- Sultaneh and- to the' presence of a South Persia Rifles 'detachment at Bam, been, safe thioughout the year.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. 27 4 Kerman -Yezd. —This route has, as usnsal, been continuously harassed bv robbers from Fars. In October a band of robbers returning with cattle stolen in a raid in the vicinity of the road were intercepted near Niriz by the Qarasuran of that place. In the skirmish that ensued the head of the Oarasuran was killed and the robbers escaped with their booty. In Ncvembfer another band who had robbed 40 camels were persued by the Deputy Governor of Bafsinian with 10 Bakhtiari sowars but after suffering a loss of one man wounded and five horses and one mule killed he was forced to abandon the persuit. In the same month a party of 15 South Persia Rifles cavalry under a British Non -Commissioned Officer was sent from Sirjan to intercept a band of 12 mounted and 20 foot robbers. In the fight that ensued the South Persia Rifles had two sowars wounded and one horse killed and were forced to break off the engagement. In another skirmish that took place a few weeks later the result was more satisfactory, three robbers being killed and four captured without any loss to the South Persia Rifles. The abolition of Rahdari on this road has ' already been mentioned under Qarasuran and trade has been greatly benefitted by this step. The other routes call for no special remarks. P ostal S ervice. The irregularity and delay of mails due to the disoigamzation of the steamer service consequent on the operations in Mesopotamia, caused great inconvenience and loss to the mercantile community and with a view to establishing a more regular and rapid service His Majesty's Consul urged the opening of a postal service between railhead at Duzdab and Kerman. The proposal was approved and the new service inaugurated in September, It has worked most satisfactorily and the time taken from Duzdab to Kerman (a distance of 385 miles) has been from six to seven days and letters from London reach Kerman in about one month as compared with five to six weeks by the old Bandar Abbas route. tSouTH Persia Rifles.

C. Crick throughout the year. In spite of the fact that at no time did the yarious units of the Brigade have their full complement of British officers, great progress was made during the year in the training of the force and it is at the time of writing a fine example of what can be produced from the most unpromising material by the zeal and skill of a handful of British Officers and Non-commissioned Officers. The prestige of the force is very high and there is keen competition among tbQ younger relations of local notables to sCrve in the commissioned ranirs,persian gulf political residency, 1920. 29 In March a column consisting of 1 squadron cavalrj, 1 company infantry and 1 machine gun under command of Captain Thomas was despatched from Saidahad to Herat-i-Khurreh to extricate the Bakhtiari Deputy Governors of Shahr Babak and Herat-i-Khurreh who with a few followers were besieged and hard pressed by the Arabs of that district. The column rescued the Bakhiiari party without coming into conflict with the Arabs and returned to Saidabad ten days later. The unmetalled motor roads from Kerman to Saidabad and from Kerman to Bam were kept in repair by working parties of South Persia Rifles. The relations of the South Persia Rifles with the local authorities have been excellent and the latter fully realize that it is due to the presence of the South Persia Rifles that the province has enjoyed a year of complete peace and security. Trade. Owing to the low rates of transport prevailing during the year, which varied from 18 to 40 Tumans per Kharwar from Bandar Abbas to Kerman, the trade of the province flourished but was hampered towards the close of the* year by high exchange rates and, in December, by the complete suspension of business on the part of the Imperial Bank of Persia owing to the situation in the North. As result of this action on the part of the Bank two of tho thirteen British Indian firms trading in Kerman, who between them conduct the greater part of the trade of Kerman, failed and the position of some others became shaky owing to their inability to remit rupees to their principals ir&gt; India who consequently could not meet their obligations in India. The import of goods from Bandar Abbas to Kerman for forwaraing to Meshed practically ceased during the year owdng to the opening of the Duzdab railway to goods traffic. This caused some decrease in certain items of import into Kerman as compared with the previous year. No Russian oil was imported into Kerman during the period under review, and all local requirements were met by imports from Bandar Abbas. The approximate amount and value of the main articles of trade imported during the year from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and Bam, excluding goods in direct traffic to Yezd via Rafsinjan and goods for Sirjan and other outlying districts is as follows :— Impoetbd into Keeman. Impobted into Bam. Weight in Kerman Mds. 1 Md. = 6-785 lbs. Value. Weight in Kerman Mds. 1 Md.-6-785 lbs. Value. Kerosine oil . Piece goods ..... Metals ...... Tobacco ..... Sugar .... * Tea ......

This caused a fall in prices of between 10 and 20 per cent, and loss to weavers. At the close of the year the foreign firms had practically ceased to give fresh orders and confined themselves to finishing work already on the looms. The total value of carpets exported from Kerman from 1st January to 81st December 1920 was £161,713 as compared with £57,328 in the previous year. No carpet caravans were interfered with by robbers throughout the year. Every advantage was taken of South Persia iiifies escorts for ensuring the safe arrival of consignments at Bandar Abbas. British Interests. Indo-European Telegraph Department .—MT. E. M. Norris, held the post of the Superintendent I. E. T. D. Kerman Sub-Division throughout the year. Imperial Bank of Persia.—Mx. H. L. G. Taylor managed the Kerman branch of the I. B. P. from the beginning of the year till March when he proceeded on leave to England and was relieved by Mr. A. W. Black. Mr. Black was replaced by Mr. W. J. D'Alton at the close of the year. A British Accountant was also maintained during the greater part of the year. As noted elsewhere the Bank at the close of the year was, under orders from Tehran, practically doing no business, owing to the situation in the North. Church Missionary Society.

Personal—Mr. E. E. Gunter, Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Gulf Section, returned from combined leave to England and took political charge of the Mekran Coast from Mr. S. N. Wilson, Officiating Director, on 19th May 1920. Qun -runninq. —Thirty-seven rifles of various kinds and some ammunition were reported as landed on the Mekran Coast during the year. A considerable number of rifles—mostly *303 Service pattern - have found their way into Mekran hHountry craft from Dubai and Minab. Very few if any, Afghans came to Mekran with the object of purchasing arms and ammunition as all those imported find a quick sale and do not meet the demand m the country. Persian Baluchistan.— Qawveh have occurred between the heads of the different tribes inhabiting this part of Persia but no fighting on a large scale was renorted. Khalifah Khair Mohamed who was a source of great trouble during the war has been quiet. It appears that he has lost his influence among the Balachis. The chief events of the year are enumerated below In January one Ghulam Mohamed of Khisig, a robber of some notoriety, with a handful of followers appeared at Tezkopan near Charbar. He looted indiscriminately the money and goods of both the people of Mekran and of British Indian Subjects and was a considerable source of trouble to the people going to and coming from Dashtyari. It is considered that by these depredations, Ghuiam Mohamed was avenging the death of his uncle who was killed by the subjects of Din Mohamed. The chiefs of the district did not suppress the man and seemed afraid of him as he was one of the Lieutenants of Mir Hoti of Lashar. He was finally disposed of by Sirdar Husain Khan. In August Sayed one of the Rind brothers who were implicated in the shooting of the sepoys of the Charbar garrison in ^ 1919, was killed by the followers of Mir Din Mohamed. ^ In this affair the chief was assisted by Luloo, brother of the victim, with whom he had a feud. In October a Baluchi of Pashamug in Sirbaz district named Mohamed Murad fired on a water party of the Cbarbar garrison (l-117th Mahrattas) from a garden near the Telegraph Station. Two sepoys were wounded and the attacker was killed. It is notyet definitely known whether he had any associates or not. The Intelligence Officer from Bushire came to Charbar and held an enquiry into the matter. Claims. —The claims amounting to Rs. 932 made by the British Indian Subiects at Charbar for looting of their goods which followed the attack ot the Telegraph Station by the followers of the Khalifah Khair Mohamed m the early part of May 1915, were settled by gradual deductions made from the telegraph subsidies of Sirdar Husain Khan, Mir Mahmud Knan and Mir Dm Mohamed Khan. Foreign Subjects. —No subjects of any European powers arrived at Charbar durine the year. Lieutenant Barbiroglio, Corpora! Earneti and Private Scarparolo of the Italian Air Force who came to Charbar m J 919 to construct hangars for their incomiEg flying machines, left the place in May 1920.32 administration report of the Subsidies. —The following chiefs were in receipt of telegraph subsidies during the year Annual teieaeaph StTBSIDT.

The telegraph line between Charbar and Jask was interrupted during the year by wilful damage as follows :— 51 hours during January. March. April. May. June. August. September. Wrecks.—In February owing to a great storm eight dingies foundered in tbe bay and two were driven ashore at Gwadur. The major portion of the cargo of the vessels was lost. Some of the goods salved was delivered to the consignees. The British Indian Subjects have brought claims for value of goods said to have been stolen by the Gwadur subjects during the storm. The matter was still under enquiry when the year closed. In September S.S. &lt;s Pentacotta ' of the British India Steam Navigation Company grounded near the Jask Telegraph Station. Damaged cargo was removed by the Baluchis by order of the Commander and the vessel was refloated. 41 82 61 48 24 7persian gulf political residency, 1920. 33 Towr—The Director left Karachi on his annual tour of inspection on the 7th December and after visiting the Telegraph Stations in the Persian Gulf, returned to head quarters on the 22nd January 1921.

This district continues to be administered by Mir Mustafa Khan who is very weak and has no influence, his brothers and sons do just as they please not only in extorting money from their own people-but also m interfering with Government servants. Mir Burkat's subjects have also been treated w r ith little respect and fre quently looted by these people. Mir Burkat out^ of regard for Mir Mustafa Khan (for whom he has great regard), has refrained from taking measures but there seems no doubt that in the event of the latter s death, Mr. Burkat will take steps and punish them and take over the Jask district when it is hope that there will be little, if any, trouble in this respect. ^ Mir Hoti of Jask, a brother chief of Mir Mustafa Khan, has very little influence m the district but gives us no trouble and as far as he is able does his best to look after our interests.

The Sirdar of this district is Husain Khan. He is still very young and impulsive. He is still trying to manage his own affairs after being badl^ served by his previous guardians Mohamed Khan of Eanuch and later by ms uncle (Mudat Khan). Mir Din Mohamed Khan of Dashtyan still appears to be the most influential chief and has apparently given up the idea ot taking a hand in the ruling of Gaih district. A certain amount of enmity existed between him and Ms brother chief (Mir Mahmud Khan of Dashtyari) but to all intents and P^poscs outwardly at least seem to hare patched up the peace.

Frincipal events. —The most interesting historical event and one that will long be remembered in Mohammerah was the visit in May of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to Mohammerah where he was the guest of His Excellency Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I. Preparations for his coming were carried on apace, and all the buildings of the town as well as those of the European quarters were gaily decorated by day and illuminated by night. The Sheikh's palace presented a spectacle well worth seeing with its display of flags and brilliant electric illuminations. On arrival in the R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' His Majesty received a tre mendous ovation from loyal subjects who thronged'the river banks. There were great demonstrations on disembarkation and again when His Majesty left Mohammerah. During His Majesty's stay at Mohammerah audiences were granted to His Britannic Majesty's Consul, the Heads of the British Eirms, tribal Sheikhs and Local Notables and merchants. Numerous presents were given by the Sheikh to His Majesty and the un dermentioned titles were conferred on the Sheikh and his sons :— H. E. the Sheikh Sardar Aqdas. Sheikh Chassib Khaa Sardar Arfaa. Sheikh Abdul Hamid Khan Sardar Ajal. Sheikh Abdul Majid Sardar Kishwar. Sheikh Abdul Karim Sardar Lashkar. Sheikh Abdulla Sardar Sharaf. Sheikh Abdul Aziz Nusrat-ul-Mulk. On the 16th April His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah was quietly married to Batool Khanum, Eakhrus Sultauah, daughter of the late Hussein Ali Khan, Nezam-us-Sultanah. She had arrived at Mohammerah after visit ing Kerballa and Najaf presumably to settle certain affairs with the Sheikh. A few days later an interesting document relative to the sale of certain land property belonging to Eakhr-us-Sultanah was presented at the Consulate for attestation and registration. A summary of the document was that Batool Khanum appeared before a religious court and sold to His Excellency the Sheikh on her own account and on behalf of her mother the whole of their shares, which consisted of half the undermentioned properties belonging to them in Arabistan, which had been transferred to them by the late Nezam-us-Sultanah. Lands situated on the west side of the Karun Ghanafcheh lands Nahr-i-Hashim land Aal-i-Kishir lands and &amp; quarter of the two lines of bazaar and the shares in the Caravanserai at Ahwaz. The above sold wholly to the Sheikh for Tomans 25,000 and t 1 ae amount paid to the seller. Eakhr-us-Sultanah is a cousin of the present Nizam-us-Sultanah33 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE It was said that Waqar-ul-Mulk was instrumental in arranging the marriage from Teheran. ^ In January the presentation of the river steamer H. P. 7 by Major- General Sir G. E. MacMunn, K.C.B., K.C.S.L, D.S.O., the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Mesopotamia on behalf of His Majesty's Government to His Excellency Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan, G.C.L E., K.C.S.L, Sheikh of Mohammerah took place at Mohammerah. A flotilla left Basrah in pro3ession and this formation was maintained on entrance to the Karun Eiver where it was decided that the presentation should be made. On anchoring all the ships were dressed and a salute fired from the Sheikh's battery, and the Sheikh's band played the National Anthem. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief pro c eeded on board H. P. 7 where all the other principal officers and guests ^ere assembled. When all was in readiness His Excellency the Sheikh proceeded on board accompanied by his sons and local officials, and was met by the General Officer Commanding and conducted to the upper deck of the steamer where a guard-of-honour was furnished by a detachment of Indian infantry. After the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief had delivered his speecb r the British flag was hauled down and the Persian flag hoisted on the forward staff of the steamer and a salute of 13 guns was fired by H.M.S. Britomart.' The Sheikh's reply ^as then read out. The steamer weighed anchor and the flotilla proceeded down river and up the Shatt-el-Arab to the Sheikh's palace, where the General Officer Command ing, officers and guests disembarked and went into the Durbar Hall, where refreshments were served. During conversation His Excellency the Sheikh repeatedly expressed his loyalty, devotion and appreciation. Shortly after wards, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief took leave and embarked under a salute of 15 guns fin d by the Persian Gun boat ' Persepolis.' Sheikh Abdul Majid Khan, Assistant Deputy Governor of Mohammerah, and the fourth son of His Excellency the Sheikh was married to the daughter t&gt;f Agha Jaffir, a Persian leading merchant and notable resident of Basrah, father-in-law of Haji Moshir-ut-Tujjur, son of Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, C.I.JS. The usual feasts and entertainments were held and the European residents of Mohammerah were invited to a dinner at the palace. Some of the military officers of Basrah were also invited to a dinner at the palace in honour of the occasion. It was noticeable that the Karguzar was not invited to any of the cere- mouies and festivities. The death of Prince Moayid-ud-Dowleh, Governor-General of Arabistan, occurred on the 4tli September. The Prince appointed the Political Officer at Dizful as his executor. The deceased deprived one of his sons from benefits. In June the Civil Department in Iraq, the British Chambers of Commerce, ' General Head Quarters, the Imperial Bank of Persia, Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, Lindted, Messrs. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, and Messrs. The Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited, were informed that His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah had notified that he would not hold himself financially or otherwise responsible for any transactions financial and other entered into by his sons, or by persons purporting to be acting on his behalf unless authorisation from His Excellency Sheikh of Mohammerah was produced in each separate case. This notification was the outcome of a letter addressed to the Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia by His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Local JPqlice. —There has been a steady decrease in the numbers of the force and this now totals about 90. There were a few cases of intrigues by some of the officers directed against the LocaLCommissioner, which resulted in dismissal. Ihere were also several desertions and resignations owing to the men not ^ e ing paid their salaries regularly.persian gulf political residency, 1920. 89 Several robberies were reported in the town, but tlie work of the Police on the whole has been satisfactory. Adliyeh. The work carried on satisfactorily until a dissension arose amon 0, st the members of the Judicial Court which resulted in the resignation of one member representing the Bahrein community. No official meetings were held for some considerable time and the work at present is being carried on by the Police Commissioner with the assistance of a couple of his officers. Consular Escort—No guard has yet been provided for the Consulate. Two local Persians act as police during the day. The night guard is furnished by the Sheikh's ghulams. Customs.—Vh-h Department worked under Monsieur Andrieux as Director throughout the year. Several confiscations were made, the most important being^that of a Nakhoda named Toweyi] reported to be a notorious smuggler of goods, also arms and ammunition from Koweit to Mohammerah. In this case the Nakhoda succeeded in disposing of the majority of his goods, but remainder were seized together with his sailing vessel. He was imprisoned by the Local Authorities and was to be released on payment of a fine of Krs. 15,000. The telegram from the Central Customs Administration, Teheran to the Director of Customs, Mohammerah, informing him of the new tariff as revised by the Anglo-Persian Commission which came into force from the 1st. Hamal was not received with general satisfaction. There was at first a rush on the Customs to get goods cleared and later telegrams were sent by the leading merchants to Teheran and Bnshire complaining and protesting against some of the rates which were considered exorbitant. A deputation of leading merchants, who were granted an audience, even laid this as a grievance before His Imperial Majesty the Shah at Mohammerah. Fostsatid Telegraphs—These departments worked satisfactorily during the yea^*. The protest of the British firms and the few leading merchants against the monopoly of the telephone line to Basrah which was hired solely to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, resulted in the installation of a public call telephone in the British Telegraph Office. A 6-minutes conver sation cost Re. 1 and the telephone is seldom if ever used by the public. The Post and Telegraph offices are shortly to be worked as a combined office. Telegrams in vernacular, i.e., Arabic and Persian are now accepted. Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. —The Company^ operations during the year included a great deal of extension work, still in progress. Work has also been carried on at Barwada, below Abadan, where the more dangerous petroleum products are stored prior to export. This site was secured as it is a safe distance from the main works. Two unfortunate incidents occured during the year. In May the Indian employees of the Company petitioned the Works Manager for an increase of SO per cent, of wages. His Britannic Majesty's Consul»was asked to interview ^the men. After much controversy they were persuaded to accept 20 per cent, and await the decision of the London Directors to whom the matter was to be referred. In October, however, the employees took advantage of the arrival at Abadan of Mr. Nichols, one of the Directors, and struck work till their demands were accepted. The Director interviewed several of the representa- # tives of different classes at Abadan and after hearing their grievances sanctioned the increase asked for. The next day the Persian employees followed the example of the Indians and refused to leave the Manager's office till a similar increase was sanctioned. •The Works Manager telephoned |for assistance to His Britannic Majesty's Consul, who reported the matter to the Sheikh, who sent down some of his -gulams to turn the men away. His Britannic Majesty's Consul also proceeded to Abadan to interview the men. A deputation was interviewed by the Director next day and an increase of wages and certain allowances whicu worked out to about a 50-per cent, increase was sanctioned.40 administration report of the Twx) fires also occurred at Abadan, one of which destroyed nine small tanks which were partly full of fuel oil. One of the Bauxite plants was also destroyed. Both fires were soon got under control, and it is believed that the damage was estimated at about £30,000. The Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited. —The Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited carried on its business during the year. There were three or four changes in the Deputy Managerships, the present incumbent being Mr. R. 0. Howe. A collision occurred on 6th January in the Karun River between ihe S;S. ' Kamarezzeman' , belonging to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company (Agents : The Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited) and a motor boat owned by a Baghdad! Jew. The case was reported to the Consulate, and the finding of the court, which consisted of His Britannic Majesty's Consul, as President, and two assesors, namely, Commander Hughes- Hallet, R.LM. and Lieutenant-Commander Rawson, R.I.M., was that the &lt;c Kamarezzeman ' was at fault. The Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited contended that the case came under the India Merchant Shipping Act and that damages should be awarded accordingly, but it was finally referred to Arbitra tion, to decide the case on its merits, and the decision of the Law Officers of the Crown as to whether the Act does apply to inland rivers in Persia is still awaited. One of the Standard Oil Company Limited steamers of New York, S.S. t£ Tiger,' arrived in October with a cargo of 21,392 cases of Kerosine oil for Mohammerah. She also discharged cases of kerosine oil at the Gulf ports. The Imperial Banh of Persia. —The Imperial Bank of Persia carried on its work during the year. Mr. Cowser, the Manager, proceeded on leave and was relieved by Mr. Styler who has been in charge for the past six months. The Bank has had a busy year with the collection of overdue documentary bill and protesting of bills due to the many bankruptcies, as a result of the sterling exchange amongst the Jewish merchants. Quarantine and Health. —Assistant Surgeon C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., held the post of Quarantine Medical Officer during the year. The Charitable Dispensary in the town continued to be well attended. C. H. LINCOLN, Acting British Consul for Arabistan.persian gulf political residency, 1920. 41 CHAPTER VI. Annua! Administration Report of the Ahwaz Vice-Consulate 1920. Personel. Captain E. G. B. Peel on return from leave resumed charge of 41ie Yice-Consulate from Captain E. H. O, Elkington, M. C. Captain Elkington preceded on leave on 18th May 1920 and on his return 4n December was posted to Dizful as Yice-Consul. Captain C. Wallis arrived at Ahwaz on 2ath November 1920 as assistant to His Majesty's Vice-Consul. Mr. K. K. Som acted as Head Clerk until his death on 22nd July 1920 when he was replaced by Mr. K. M. Sahani under contract to the Civil Admi nistration at Baghdad. S. A. S. Ata liohamed was attached to the Ahwaz Civil Hospital through' out the year. Ahwaz and District. —No events of note occurred in this district. The Sheikh of Mohammerah and his local representative Sheikh Abdul Hamid have handled their tribes well and there has been little or no crime. A serious fire caused by the accidental overturning of a lamp destroyed the whole of the Moin bazaar. The bazaar is now being rebuilt with domed roofs of mud brick instead of with timber and mats and a number of minimax fire extinguishers have been ordered by the Baladiyeh. The 1920 crop proved a failure and prices have ruled unprecedentedly high. Ahwaz residents were adversely affected by the embargo placed on the export of grain from the Dizful and Shushtar districts. Orders were received in the Autum for the withdrawal of the Military detachment stationed at Ahwaz. Owing to the difficulty of removing stores and plant the detachment had not left by the end of the year. Trade has been seriously affected by the fall in exchange and the universal s^mp. ^Many of the smaller merchants in Ahwaz notably Jews have gone Branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia have been opened in Dizful and Shushtar in charge of Persian Agents. Dizful and Shushtar.—'K^ov W. L. Meade held political charge of Dizful and Shushtar with headquarters at Dizful until November when he was tem porarily relieved by Captain W. J. Warren who handed over charge to Captain Elkington M. C. at the close of the year. The detachment of two Indian Cavalry squadrons located at Shush was withdrawn at the beginning of May and was replaced by two fighting fords with a personnel of Indian Machine gunners. The latter'have proved useful on more than one occasion but the bad state of the roads entails their being laid up frequently for repairs. The Sangwand levy which is now maintained by the Persian Government under the supervision of a British officer is perhaps more ornamental than useful but serves to impress the pusillanimous inhabitants of Dizful and the vicinity. The real factor in maintaining peace on the Luristan-Amara, border is the personal influence of the Political Officer, now styled Vice-Consul, whose authority the Persian Government, acting on reports from local malcontents has latterly been doing its best to undermine. The town of Dizful is left to the42 administration report of the care of the 'Deputy Governor, at present the brother of His Excellency Vikar- ul-Mulk, Governor General of Arabistan, but tribal politics are almost entirely in the hands of the Vice-Consul. When it is necessary to resort to armed force the Vice-Consul calls in the aid of the Chief of the Sedentary Sagwands who receives a subsidy from the Persian Government and also supplies most of the sowars forming the Sagwand levy. Until June 1920 the chief of these Sagwands was Sartip Khan. In that month he refused to send Sagwand sowars to Shush castle to take over from the retiring cavalry detachment and finding that he was losing control of his tribe tendered his resignation and was replaced by Sadiq Khan, a man of much stronger character. Sartip Khan took refuge with a renegade Sagwand living in Pushtikuh named Mezban Khan and was shortly afterwards killed in a brawl by Mezban Khan. In November Bartip's brother Mehrali Khan made a determined attempt to oust iSadiq Khan which was frustrated by the prompt action of Captain Warren who had just arrived at Dizful. In the course of the fighting two sections of the Sagwand levy who were partisans of Sartip deserted with there rifles and ammunition, one are still outlaws. Sadiq Khan has now consolidated his position by allying himself with the most powerful sections of the Baharwand and Qalawand tribes. At Shushtar British interests have been ably looked after by Khan Sahib Mirza Ali Khan. He wields great influence in the town and has devoted himself assidously to increasing the efficiency of the various Government Depart ments and checking the rapacity of successive Governors-General. In response to pressure from Teheran it has been considered advisable to relax much of the control exercised by the British representative over Local Departments of the Persian Government, with what result remains to be seen. In this respect the situation is different from that at Uizful since the only tribes in the vicinity of Shushtar are the Bakhtiaries who are amenable to control through their Khans. At the same time the situation needs careful watching. It is noteworthy that during the disturbances in Mesopotamia in the summer Arabistan remained unaffected and provided that Local Consular officers receive the same measure of support which they have had during the past few years it is likely that North Arabistan will remain tranquil whatever may happen in the North of Persia. Our chief difficulty has been to shift the financial responsibility for the maintenance of law r and order on to the shoulders of the Persian Government due to (a) the withholding of the greater part of the Customs allotment which for several years provided funds for the expenses of the Governor General at Shushtar and {b) the refusal of the Sheikh of Mohammerah to pay any of the revenue due from him to the Persian Government until I is claim for reimbur sement of sums spent on behalf of the Persian Government during the war had been met. Efforts are being made to persuade the Sheikh to pay up his revenue before the end of the financial year. Lynch Road—No organized robberies took place during the year though there was a certain amount of pilfering in the snmmer due to the absence of a recognized Hlkhani and Illbe^i. The average rate charged for goods carried from Ahwaz to Isfahan was Krs. 11,60 per shah maund as compared with Krs. 17,67 in 1919 and Krans 23.40 in 1918. The rate would have been lo^er still owing to exceptionally good harvests in Bakhtiari had not mules been difficult to obtain. The con fidence of Muleteers was sapped by reports that the Kuhgilus would take advantage of the absence of the Illkhani and Illbegi to recommence their depredations in the summer. Both the iron bridges were overhauled and repaired at a cost of some Tomans 3000 which was obtained from the Khans without much difficulty through the agency of His Majesty's Vice-Consul. JBakhtiari. —The commencement of the year found Bakhtiari without any official Governors and this state of things continued until March whew the taskpersian gulf political residency, 1920. of governing Bakhtiari was entrusted to Sirdar Aslijaa pro tern. The remain- v ing Khans of importance with the exception of Sirdar Jang, Governor of Isfahan and Sirdar Assad, Governor of Kerman proceeded to Teheran in the hope of composing their family feuds with the assistance of His Britannic Majesty's Minister and incidentally lining their pockets by fishing in troubled water. Negotiations were prolonged throughout the summer without result. An arrangement promoted by the Persian Government, who were at the time afraid of the Bolshevik menace, to partition practically the whole of western and central Persia among the leading Khans in return for a garrison of 1000 Bakhtiari sowars to be maintained at Tehran fortunately fell through owing to disputes among the Khans themselvss regarding the allotment of Governor ships. In September the Khans moved to Isfahan where another long conference was held and where they were joined by Sirdar Ashjaa and Murteza Quli Khan who had meantime been carrying on the Government of Bakhtiari with con siderable success. The arrangement finally made was that the offices of Illkhani and Illbegi should revert to the most senior Khans, namely Samsam us Sultaneh and Amir Mufakhan, an arrangement which had been in abeyance since Sirdar Jang's dictatorship in 1912. Samsam expressed the intention of coming south himself but the news of the imminent opening of Parliament to which he had been elected drew him once more to Teheran and he nominated Murteza Quli Khan as his representative in Bakhtiari. This arrangement still holds although Sirdar Zaffar taking advantage of the political situation in Teheran is doing his best to renew the old family feuds. The history of the last few years proves firstly that the intrigues and machinations of Khans residing in Teheran is no true index of feeling and policy in Bakhtiari itself, and secondly, that infinitely better results are obtained by negotiating with the Khans in their own country in preference to Teheran. Our policy during the last 2 years of refusing to sacrifice Bakhtiari as a whole to the personal interest of one or more Khans who, at considerable profit to themselves, assisted us during the war, has borne fruit, and has given them a confidence in our. intentions which has been lacking for years. Provided this policy is continued there is little fear of the Bakhtiari tribes on whose good will the safety of the Oilfields chiefly depends, betraying our interests in the South whatever may happen in the North. Although the &lt;£ Commission ' scheme referred to in last year's report has remained more or less a dead letter, the younger Khans have obtained a far greater share in the responsibilities of Government and are not likely to allow Bakhtiari to be exploited in the interests of Khans residing in Teheran. Por this reason history is not likely to repeat itself in regard to a big movement of tribesmen to Teheran although they will almost certainly seize and hold Isfahan as soon as the Central Government shows signs of collapsing. In spite of the absence of recognised governors during the greater part of the year Bakhtiari itself has remained extremely tranquil, a state of things which can be attributed in a large measure to plentiful harvests after years of scarcity. Kuhgilu. —Owing to the disturbance in Mesopotamia during the summer the Vice-Consul did not consider it advisable to travel far afield and no tour was made in Kuhgilu. Friendly letters have however, been received from many of the Chiefs^ who have a wholesome dread of another expedition like that of 1918 in which we lent two mountain guns to the Bakhtiari Khans. It is to the memory of the execution caused by these guns rather than to any steps taken by the Bakhtiari Khans, to which the immunity of the Lynch Road from organised robberies during 1920 must be attributed. Probable extension of the Oil Company's operations towards the South east renders it essential that close relations should be maintained with the various Kuhgilu Chiefs and Sir Arnold Wilson during his vist to Arabistan in November 19?0 laid stress on the importance of having a reliable British Consular Agent at Behbehamu administration report of the A revenue collecting expedition in Knhgilu is to be undertaken, by the Bakhtiari Khans this winter and they have announced their intcation of withhoding the revenues of the Ram Hormuz district for this year to provide funds for the expedition. Anglo-Persian Oil The operations of the Company have steadily extended. Kut Abdullah pumping station was brought into commission in October and Mullasani and Dorquain pumping stations will be ready shortly. Drilling operations in Pushtikuh have had to be postponed owing to transport difficulties. The Indian labour employed in Arabistan is now becoming organized, and is reacting to the industrial situation in India. A strike occurred at the oil fields in June, but was speedily settled through the intervention of the Vice- Consul. The causes of the strike and the conditions of labour at the oilfields have been fully discussed elsewhere. An entirely new regime has been introduced by Mr. H. E. Nichols, one of the London Directors of the Oil Company, who arrived in December armed with full powers, and the new arrangements for the pay and housing of Indian labour are more than adequate. At the same time every effort is being made to develop the local supply of skilled labour and gradually decrease the Company's dependence on labour imported from India. A succession of bad harvests has made it difficult to supply the demands of the ever increasing number of workmen. Increased cultivation can only be secured by the preservation of law and order and for this reason alone it is of the utmost importance that our political hold on North Arabistan should be retained.

It was, however, pointed out to him, that it was a burden which had been unwillingly shouldered in the interests of law and order, interests which the war had compelled us to seriously attend to, and that unless he desired a repetition of the former chaotic state of affairs he would be wise to allow conditions to resume a normal state gradually. Being a man of intelligence he quickly perceived that the state of tranquility and prosperity in which he found the province was entirely due to British effort, and although the idea of foreign interference was somewhat repugnant he reconciled himself to a stains quo which he felt incapable of changing without endangering his own existence. He was socially a pleasant and interesting man and his letters to Tehran were a flattering tribute to our assistance in this part of Persia. He was succeeded a month after his death by Vicar-ul-Mulk, this being the latter's seventh visit in this capacity to Arabistan. Wassiq-us-Sultaneh, the Deputy Governor of Shushtar, acted as Governor-General until the arrival of Vicar-ul-Mulk. Samsam-ul-Mamalek, the Deputy Governor of Dizful, was succeeded by Muyaid-us-Sultan, the uncle of His Royal Highness Muyaid-ud-Dowleh, in May and in turn was replaced by Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, the brother of Vicar- ul-Mulk, in November. Saraj-ul-Mulk, the Head of the Revenue, was relieved by Muaziz-ul-Mulk in October. The latter was a capable and honest man, qualities which soon brought him into disfavour with His Royal Highness Muyaid-ud-Dowleh, who48 administration report of the eventually succeeded in getting him dismissed by the Authorities in Tehran in March. He was replaced as Kafil by Mirza Abdul Hussein, a Political Officer nominee, who has performed his duties fairly satisfactory. Mirza Hassan, the Head of the Dizful Police, has continued in that office throughout the year and has given every satisfaction, crime in the town being absurdly lacking. Muhtashemeh-i-Huzur, the Head of the Shushtar Police, has not carried out his duties very satisfactorily, and there have been many complaints against his methods and attempts to extort money. The political tone has been eminently satisfactory, the Governor-General, his Deputies and subordinates have been gradually allowed and encouraged to resume control of the Administration which so long as the eyes of the Political Officer are upon them is carried out fairly well. The judicious application of the brake when their avarice overcomes their prudence is, however, essential, and I consider the advice* although not too palatable at the time, is generally much appreciated in the end. Our relations with all classes have been most cordial, particularly with the merchants and lower classes who look to us, and with every reason, as their protectors against their richer and more powerful neighbours. Tribal. Tribal affairs have continued to be administered by the Political Officer. The reason being that these gentry will have nothing to do with the Governor- General and local Governors whom they despise, and mistrust. As the friendly attitude of the tribal leaders is essential for the maintenance of law and order and without their co-opefation it would be impossible to collect a penny of Eevenue, it has been and is the chief work of the Political Officer to maintain, at least outwardly, friendly relations between them and the Persian Authori ties, and to act as the medium through which the necessary instructions pass. In April Sartip Khan, Bahadur, the Chief of the Sag wand II, became openly obstructive, finally tendering his resignation. His object seems to have been to embarrass us with a view to obtaining an increase in his subsidy for good behaviour, and supply of road patrols, etc. He seized the opportunity to do so when the squadron of the 5th Cavalry evacuated Shush. To his extreme surprise and indignation his resignation was accepted and his cousin Sadiq Khan summoned to assume charge of the tribe. Sartip Khan fled and allied himself with a gang of robbers with whom he was defeated by the Sagwand Levy. He then took refuge with Mezban Khan, a renegade Sagwand in Pusht-i-Kuh territory, who killed him in a quarrel which ensued a few days after his arrival. The career of this ingrate thus came to a fitting end. Sadiq Khan was enthusiastically received by the majority of the Sagwands, who had grown weary of Sartip's avaricious ways, and although not without a stainless character in the past, he has given every satisfaction up to date. In November Sayed Mohamed Khan, Mer Ali Khan and Harab Khan, all Sagwands and close relatives of the late Sartip Khan, brought to a climax a series of intrigues against Sadiq Khan by breaking into open rebellion. Sayed Mohamed Khan claiming the Headship of the Sagwand II, collected a band of adherents, and seizing the opportunity when Sadiq Khan's sowars were advanced on his main camp. Action was delayed by the Political Officer who attempted to persuade the two factions to arrive at an amicable settle ment. During the delay Sadiq Khan's sowars were hastily summoned, and the Amleh Lurs and Mushattat Arabs called upon to assist. So that when the negotiations were broken off, Sayed Mohamed Khan was being rapidly surrounded. Sadiq Khan promptly attacked and completely routed the enemy, who had their camp sacked and were compelled to abandon their women and children. There is little doubt that if the attack had been pressed home with more energy neither Sayed Mohamad Khan nor a single follower would have escaped alive. ^ Luckily for them this was not the case and he managed to escape into Bani Lam territory across the river Khaikeh,persian gule political residency, 1920. 49 T avo troops of the Levy who had been enlisted from Sartip Khan's followers deserted k&gt; Seyed Mohamad Khan as soon as he openly declared his intentions; some were killed-in the fighting and the remainder escaped with him. The Amleh Lurs and Mushattat Arabs have been most orderly throughout the year and have assisted the Political Officer in every way when called upon. Saifullah Khan, the Head of one section of the Amleh Lurs who was sentenced to two years' imprisonment last year for the attempted murder of Ghulam Eeza Khan, the Head of the other section of these Lurs, and afterwards released is a great assist in combating the intrigues of the latter with the Sagwands. I am considerably impressed with Saifullah Khan,who has been several times mentioned in the past in the intelligence reports of the Karun front for his conspicuous bravery and loyal help to the 23rd Cavalry P. E. The relations with the Luristan tribes have been on the whole very amicable and most of their chiefs have visited Dizful during the year. It is hoped that it will be possible to put a stop to the petty looting which these tribes usually indulge in previous to their return to the hills in the spring. The Chenana and Khasraj tribes who are nominally under the Bani Lam of Mesopotamia, but whose habitation is actually in Persian territory, require more effective measures for their control. The status of tlie latter especially requires defining and it is hoped that early steps will be taken by the necessary authorities to do so. Their depredation across the Karkheh river into Dizful territory are fairly frequent and they are a constant menace on the Caravan route between Dizful and Amara. Sagwand Levy. The Levy was reinforced in the spring by the addition of two fighting fords under Lieutenant A. Amos. Its work during the year has been satisfactory,Its chief duties being the protection of cultivators in outlying districts, and the pursuit of small bodies of raiders. A. party of Andelwand Bakhtiaris who attacked a caravan early in the year were captured to a man, the Indian Duffadar in charge of the Levy receiving the I. D. S. M. as a reward for his initiative in this enterprise. Its good record was however badly smirched on account of the desertion of two sections of Sagwands to the rebel Sayed Mohamad Khan, and it has thus had to be entirely reconstituted. It now consists of two sections of Sagwands and one section of Kurds, totalling 44 men supported by two fighting fords manned by six I. O. B,.'s The presence of this Levy is a very valuable asset to the Political Officer in maintaining order amongst the sedentary tribes, and in the general policy of the district. 1 he gradual elimination of the greater part of the Sagwand element however, is to be advocated. 'Revenue. The revenue of Arabistan has showed a marked improvement and one can be fairly confident, that if the present state of affairs continues, and no political upheaval takes place, the Persian Administration will be able to shoulder in reality next financial year, the burden necessary for the main tenance of security and therefore collections of revenue which they stated that they were prepared to accept in April. These liabilities amount to approximately Krans 25,000 per mensem or Hupees 8,300. The Revenue for the year 1920 amounted to Krans 51,3932 as compared with Krans 37 s ,425 collected in 1919. The important contribution of His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah has hitherto not been forthcoming, and he still claims that the Persian Government are in his debt on account of expenditure incurred by him on their behalf during the war.50 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE f It is to be hoped that this vexed question will- be settled before the commencemeiit of next financial year. Trade. Trade has been somewhat stagnant owing largely to the big stocks on hand and the fluctuations of exchange. There have been no bankruptcies but there is undoubted uneasiness as to the future. The Imperial Bank of Persia have opened Agencies in Dizful and Shushtar during the year and have accordingly considerably increased their business. The presence of these Agencies is a great assistance to the merchants who are now able to transact their financial business in Dizful and Shushtar instead of having to proceed to Ahwaz to do so. The Agencies of Messrs, the Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation and Messrs. Strick Scott and Company in Dizful and Shushtar are progressing favourably, but whether it is due to pressing business elsewhere, or to a disinclination to trust their Native Agents with large stocks, they do not seem to be pushing their trade in those new fields at present. The Dizful Bridge Company has paid a yearly dividend of 9 per cent, on the British Government-owned Preference Shares and 18 per cent, on those held by private persons, I understand that one of the British Pirms at present trading in Arabistan may be invited to take over the British Government shares and incidentally, the management of the Bridge Company, which is at present invested in the Political Officer. Messrs. the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have not as yet commenced any operations in this district, but preparations have been made to open up the road between Shush and their workings at Dehlurah in Pusht-i-Kuh if required. They have been supplfed with 102,299 maunds of wheat and 17,275 of grain from Shushtar and 7,000 maunds of wheat from Dizful during the year. The success of the Dizful Bridge Company and the inestimable asset of the bridge to the town of Dizful, has ma^e the inhabitants of Shushtar desirous for their own bridge over the Shatait to be repaired and a dam constructed at the same time. The scheme would result in the complete irrigation of the country between the Shahtait and Karun. Plans and estimates have been prepared and it is hoped that with the financial and moral assistance of the British firms in Arabisian combined with money locally subscribed this long ^ looked for scheme may see fruition. Communication. The road between Dizful and Shush and Shush and Ahwaz has been kept open for motor traffic throughout the year, but the lack of any funds either from the Persian Administration or the British Government makes this task increasingly difficult. The wooden-trestle bridge over the Shaur river near Shush, the replace ment of which by a permanent structure was the condition on which His Majesty's Troops evacuated this area has not yet been commenced. The attention of the authorities has been drawn to this fact, and it is hoped that the work will soon be taken in hand. A road for ford cars has been discovered between Dizful and Shushtar via Papehch -Sar-Besheh-Gutwand and Qaleh Ali Rushan, which brings this town considerably nearer Headquarters. Up to date without the road being touched the trip has been done in 30 hours, the approximate distance being 65 miles, it is however impassable for a day after heavy rain. The possession of at least two foid cars is now more than ever a necessity for the Political Officer in charge of this area. Crops were poor in comparison with last year but there was no sickness amongst cattle or sheep.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. 51 General, In conclusion, I would like to place on record the excellent work done by the staff who although very shorthanded have always worked their utmost. The work of Mirza Mahmood Khan, headmunshi of Dizful, and Mirza Ali Khan, head munshi, now Consular Agent of Shushtar deserves special mention. The intimate knowledge that these two Mirzas possess of local conditions and tribal affairs has been of great value. Both ha ve been awarded the distinction of Khan Saheb by His Excellency the Viceroy during the year. E. H. 0. ELKINGTON, Ca'ptain i 1.

From 3rd March to 10th April the Political Agent accompanied His Highness the Sultan on his official visit to His Excellency the Viceroy in India, and during this period Mr. M. J. Gazdar, Head Clerk, held charge of the current duties of the Agency. The post of Agency Surgeon continued vacant The Senior Medical Officer, Bait-ul-Ealaj, officiated in charge of the Agency and Telegragh Staff. Mr. Ehtisham-ud-Doulah Khan continued to be Dragoman of the Agency throughout the year. Sub-Assistant Surgeon T. P. DeSouza remained in charge of the hospital throughout the year. Monsieur Yvoneou, the Warrant Officer in charge of the French Coal Bepot officiated as French Consul till 20th December, since when there has been no French Consul at Muscat. Situation in Muscat and Oman. The year with which this report deals may with justice be said to have been one of the most eventful in the whole chequered history of the country. The history of the year may be divided naturally into three distinct chapters, the relations of the Sultan's government with the rebel tribes of interior Oman under their elected Imam, the reform and progress of the Sultan's administration in the territories controlled by him, and lastly the personal attitude of the Sultan himself. Though by following the sequence of events in each phase to its conclusion, cutting it out so to speak from its surroundings in order to give a clear picture of what would otherwise be an incomprehensible chase of disconnected crises, it must not be lost sight of that the events in eacii of these chapters were closely related, with their inevitable reactions fometimes calculated sometimes unforeseen upon each other. As will become clear, the successful peace with the interior was by no means unconnected with the successful reform of the administration, while the reform of the administration stood in jeopardy more than once from the attitude of the Sultan, and had to be modified profoundly in some particulars. (i) Relations of the Sultaris government with the rebel tribes of interior Oman under their elected Imam, The commencement of the year saw Sheikh Said bin Nasir al Kindi at Kizwa, the seat of the Imam, entrusted by the Political Agent with the mission of obtaining the return of the gardens confiscated by the Imam to their right ful owners, as the preliminary to the ratification of the terms discussed by the Political Agent at Sib with Sheikh Isa, the representatives of the Imam, in September of the previous year. The Adminis^rat 'on Report of last year has described the meeting at Sib, the proposed terms of agreement, and the despatch of Al Kindi on bis missionpersian gulf political residency 1920. 53 in November of that year, as also the difficulties with -which he was meeting owing to the opposition of the ' Mutawwa ' party. Suffice it to say that the Mutawwa party finally gained the car of the Imam who on the 18th February whqn A1 Kindi accompanied by Sheikh Isa bin Salih and several other prominent: Sheikhs preferred their request before him in person, definitely refused to return the gardens and to ratify the proposed settlement. ' For some time before this breakdown of the negotiations it had been felt which way the wind was blowing. Miss Bell in the course of her prolific writings on the Arab has made one true statement concerning hinx, when she refers to him as ' with his eyes fixed unblinkingly on the main chance The more powerful or the more important the Arab the more unblinking are bis eyes and the more personal is the main chance. In the case of those in power in Oman the main chance was the confiscated property whose produce thev were enjoying, ai d towards the recovery of which the British Government seemed to be exerting a languid and feeble support on behalf of the Sultan's government. Greed as usual extinguished all consideration of policy or consequences, while their experience of our attitude, which from the last few years seemed to combine in their eyes indecision with insincerity and weakness caused them to discount any active interference on our part. ' The negotiations had however the advantage of showing that the polite and diplomatic way under the circumstances was useless, and the breakdown lett us tree to fol ow a somewhat stronger line with a clear conscience. It would have to be shown to the Omanis that we were sincere in our desire for peace, that we would not tolerate an openly dangerous and hostile hinterland for ever, and that the Sultan s government, did we support it not excessively but only m accordance with our treaty obligations, had the power to punish the Omanis for their perfectly unreasonable attitude. ,. The strengthening of the Sultan 's power was a clear step towards a favour- able settlement. It was his original weakness which had caused the rebellion while the contmued inaptitude and powerlessness of his administration permit ted it to continue, and made any concession from the Omanis an act of grace on their part As will be explained below the reform of the administSn was advanced with vigour, and almost synchronous with the rZsal of the Imam a British adviser to the Sultan appeared on the scene. Portlier, reports showed that owing to the complete epssaHon of import of arms into Oman the tribesmen bad largely lost their offensive power The actual refusal of the Imam was accompanied by a temporising and apologetic letter from Sheikh Isa, who seemed to expect that as usual we would birn the other cheek to this rebuff. The negotiations were however at once broken off by the Political Agent, the emissary was Lformed in knLal that permitted of no two interpretations that the Omanis would find tilt their folly had consequences, and the Sultan proceeded on the 3rd March SrSld^. ^ POhtlCal AgeQt 011 a11 ^ Visit t0 Bi8 ^celten^fe Shortly before this there had been considerable trouble atMasnaah a small port on the Batmah coast, and at Snr, the large port 90 miles south of Muscat At each place the inhabitants, encouraged by the welkneL of the administration and intrigues from Oman had refuswl t j Matcn ti.

It is on the export of their famous dates and pomegranates that the Omanis exist. The Sultan had several years before raised the zakat to 10 per cent as a punishment on the Omanis. Unfortunately this action had been taken in the mid dle of the date season, prices were upset and British merchants suffered consider able loss. The Sultan was therefore obliged at our instance to rescind his orders. Our aquiescence in this matter on this occasion was an unexpected and a severe blow to the Omanis. This acquiescence was rendered possible by the fact that ample warning was given three months before the commencement of the date season, and merchants were able to calculate the price they would pay for the produce on the basis.of the new tax. Meanwhile in Oman itself the Gods had fought against the Imam by removing Sheikh Hamyar bin Nasir al Nabhani, the paramount chief of the Ghafiri confederation, and one of the triumvirate composed of the Imam, Sheikh Isa and himself who had ruled Oman since the rebellion. Hamyar had been the sword arm while Isa had been the brains of the Omani rule. His successor was a boy of fourteen. The Omanis refused to believe for some time that the penal zakat would be brought into force. Realising after what had happened that it would be useless to approach the Political Agent, they tried the British merchants; to be met to their intense surprise by the information that as far as the mer chants knew the penal zahat would certainly be enforced. Discontent in Oman grew. There seemed no sloution except the return of the confiscated gardens. The zakat notices had explicitly given the con fiscation. of the gardens as the reason for the imposition of the tax. The Imam was approached. Dominated by his brother Nasir bin Rash : d al Kharusi, his Wali in 'Rustaq, he refused to yield. He and his brother in whose hands all power really was, began to lose ground, and a definite reaction against the puritannical fanaticism of the Imam and the exactions of his brothers set in. At the end of May a significant incident occurred. One Ahmed bin Ibrahim, the ruler of Hazm in the Sultan's territories close to Rustaq, over a question of escaped slaves provoked attack from Nasir bin Eashid of ilustaq. The latter besieged Hazm, and the Imam called on the tribes to punish Ahmed. The Imam was met by refusal or excuse in every case, while Nasir bin Rashid's men fled ignominiously at the approach of a very small relief force organised by the local government. Such a result, for in Arab warfare all depends on prestige, would have been unthinkable six months before. June saw the ferment rising in Oman ; abortive meeting followed abortive meeting in the interior, suggestions compromises, intrigues, all to get rid of the strangling penal zakat, of which the actual pinch ^was beginning to be felt, succeeded each other. Finally on the 29fcii June Sheikh Isa, swallowing his pride addressed the Political Agent by letter asking what our position was in the matter. He received at once a clear reply that we were behind the Sultan, and that having been refused once we were not prepared to exercise our good offices on their behalf again until they had rectified the manifest injustice of the confiscated property. This letter dispelled any remaining doubts the Omanis may have had# Realising that the attitude of the Imam and of his brothers, who had seized the gardens, alon« stood between them and a settlement, tired of strife and openly discontented with their present rule, they murdered the Imam Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi at Khadra on the 23rd July. Wild confusion now prevailed. The Oman tribes seemed to have lost their cohesion. The Sultan's government — fortunately the British adviser was in India and therefore we were in no way involved — made a determined effort to regain their hold over the interior, while Sheikh Isa endeavoured to rally the tribes and to secure the election of an Imam, which action alone couid save him from extinction. He managed, the history of how would be worth writing, to secure, by what we should call a packed house, the election of his father-in-lawpersian gulf political residency, 1920. 65 Mohammed bin Abdullah al KhaliH as Imam at Niz^a and reached Semail 24 hours before the Sultan's men. Tha tribes went with him, aad though later he had some difficulty at RustHq which was taken by Ahmed bm ibra- him on behalf of the Sultan, and held by h^m for some time, the issue was never really in doubt. He however well knew that in spite of his initial success, his future would depend on the removal of the penal zakat and the conclusion of a satisfactory settlement, as this had been the cause of the late crisis. He therefore at once wrote to the Political Agent, who had been able conspicuously to keep aloof asking for negotiations to be reopened. This letter is worthy of quotation in full as much as giving an insight into the character of the Omanis, as for the singular contrast of its style to that employed by supposedly more cultured nations in their official communications. ' We inform your honour that when the Imam, to whom may God be merciful was murdered, the heads of the tribes the righteous people, and the learned mm, seeing separation from God's work and dispersion of His orders, gathered together to elect an Imam. They brought forward the learned men Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili as an Imam, for in him they perceived virtues and capacity for it. r ihus that which had been shattered was made good ao-ain, and praise be to God the tribes returned to their former state, after that they were about to cause bloodshed and to rob properties, and to God is the grace and the glory. Today we reached Finja, and if God wills we intend to go to Rustaq to extinguish the fires of vengeance. From God we expect help and favour. There had taken place a discussion about sett lement, but it could not be ageed upon, but now after we have regulated our affairs it is incumbent upon us to reopen it, if God wills. We are sending this letter to you through the learned Sheikh Said bin Nasir al K^indi so that all may bo known to you, and salams.' The reply to this was that the confiscated property must first be returned unconditionally before the Political Agent would consent to mediate. Within a month the gardens had been returned unconditionally, and Isa on behalf of the Imam was waiting to meet the Political Agent. The meeting finally took place at Sib. The Political Agent filled the role of mediator between the Sultan's Government and the Omanis. He had shortly before while in India obtained a full authorisation from the Sultan to act as he thought best in the matter of an agreement, and no representative of the Sultan was therefore present. On the Omanis side were Sheikh Isa bin Salih and some twenty prominent shf ikhs with numerous followers, while Al Kindi, in his position as under the thumb of the Sultan though openly sympathising with and respected by the Omanis, was a prominent figure. After three days negotiations in which the Omanis mingled strangely shrewdness and simplicity, a desire to bluff and an astonishingly accurate knowledge of the weakness of their own position, an agreement on the following terms was concluded. The Sultan's Government would— (1) reduce the zakat on all goods coming into the coast towns to 5 per cent; (2) guarantee safety and freedom for Omanis in the coast towns; (3) remove all restrictions on the entry of Omanis into Muscat and Muttrah; (4) return fugitives from their justice and not interfere in their internal affairs ; The Omanis would— (1) remain in peace with the Sultan, not attack the coast and not inter fere with his government; (2) permit freedom of trade and travel in Oman and guarantee the safety of travellers;56 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE (3) would return and not protect fugitives.from the Sultan's justice ; (4) would hear the claims of traders and others aarainst Omank according to the Shara. All the Sheiks at Sib signed in the presence of the Political Agent foui- prisoners relations of Sheikh Isa who had been held by the Sultan for two years were released, and they then departed to obtain the signature of the Imam and several other prnmment Sheikhs. The document signed by the Imam the chiefs of the Hmawi and Ghafiri confederations, and all the most promi' nent sheikhs of Oman was received back on the 7th October. In the meantime 1 S1 o'[ A d ° cument had ljeen obtained from the Sultan's Government. Qn the 8th October peace was proclaimed and the penal zakat was lifted. The eight years rebellion of the Oman tribes is therefore for the moment at an end, though he would be an unwise man who asserted that the last Chapter had been written. The Omanis have attained in their own eves complete independence, and practically they are correct, though the Sultan mav assert that they only have home rule. The Sultan is relieved of the trouble of having even a thereotical sway over the interior, and he no longer need fpar attacks on the coast. a r a .The remainder of the year saw the agreement working satisfactorilr. Ap am after a lapse of years there is normal intercourse between the coast and the interior, Omanis throng Muttrah and trade is brisk. In the interior itself the Omanis seem to he making an effort at governnW Wahs, m several case men famed for their wisdom and political acumen have been appointed in the more important towns, while the aggressive puritanisa of the late Imam has given way to a wise tolerance. The stability of this rule huwever depends on the personal factors and on the strength and iealousies of the tribal confederations. But the Sultan's Government have little to fear as the power of the Omauis should it be directed against them, will automat:callv become less as the reform of the Sultan's administration progresses and its strength increases. ^ ttliU ils : (3) Reform and progress of the Sultan 's controlled hyhim. , end of 1919 had seen the Sultan's debts paid off by a loan of six and and a half lakhs^f rupees, a radical change in the customs administration under the control of Egyptian officers, and the rough fixing of the monthlv Sta,te expenditure and of the Sultan's privy purse. The three months workuJ of the new system from October to the end of December 1919 has so far iusti? of RsTlam treasury after meeting all expenses showed a balance Much however remained to be done, and the appointment of a British adviser to the Sultan had been sanctioned as an experimental measure, in the hope that he would be able to inaugurate the reforms and to impart such momen tum to the wheels of the administration, that the machine would be able in a short space of time to function by itself without outside assistance This JVbruary? n McCollum, I. A. K. O., arrived in the middle of (a) Finances, aotual finance of the State was clearly the most important matter as on this depended the security of' our loan, and the ability of the State to provide personnel and to pay a levy, without which things it could never hope to stand by itself and so to relieve us of our heavy expenditure and dispropor tionate responsibihties. The British adviser at once undertook a compHe overhaul ot the salaries and establishments throughout the State. A uew and reasonable civil list was prepared, surplus and useless personnel was ruthlessly abolished and absurd contracts which had existed unchallenged for yealTwere replaced by businesslike arrangements. New sources of revenue Were explo- red. The quarantine and landing arrangements were put on a sound footing and proi ed a lucrative source of income. At the same time old and uselesspersian gulf political residency, 1920. frj Government properfc/, such as the Sultan's yacht the Nur-al-Bahr was disposed of. Inspite of these drastic measures the financial outlook apnear^d gloomy and the Sultan's privy purse and the salary of Saiyid Nadir had temporarily to be reduced. The customs sustained a considerable loss by the return of the Director Saiyid Yusuf to Egypt in February for reasons of health. Abdul Salam Effendi who succeeded him however proved a vigorous and efficient admiiiis- trator, organising customs at Sur and on the Batinah coast when the Muscat arrangements had been completed. A set of customs rules was framed early in the year, and has worked satisfactorily. A treasury was instituted and a treasury officer, Mohammed Khan whp had been in the Mesopotamian administration was appointed. The regulation of the expenditure coincided with a welcome rise in tlii© receipts, due to more efficient working, and the first financial year of the State which closed on the 30th September 1920 showed the State with a cash balance of Rs. 3,51,000 in its treasury. Receipts had totalled Rs. 11,66,386 and expen- ^ ltUr o a ? oqa 8 ^' 77 i , com P r ^ d w^h the estimated Rs. 10,76,400 and Rs. 9,01,280 of the first rough budget. The budget for the year 1st October 1920 to 30th September 1921 sliows an estimated income of Rs. 14,29,400 excluding the opening balance, and an expenditure of Rs, 11,61,480. Included under the expenditure heading are Rs. 93,480 towards the repayment of the loan Rs. 78,000 for the purchase of motor boats, and Rs, 1,85,000 for the expenses of the levy. -o of October, November and December the income was Rs. 3,56,720 and the expenditure Rs. 2,92,780 including Rs. 46,740 towards the repayment of the loan and Rs. 83,0U0 for the purchase of motor boati On the 31st December therefore the State had a cash balance of Rs. 3,89,740. Jne slight discrepancy is due to the dollar assets being valued at Rs. 2 to the dollar instead of at Rs. 2-8 as formerly owing to the fall in the exchange. ^ The year may therefore be considered as a successful one from the financial point of view.

On former occasions f lyl n ^?t ir 'j 0 ' e his brothers had been left in charge, but with the presence of a British adviser, and with the necessity of allowing the latter a free hand to organise the administration, such a course was clearly inadvisable, and the StetlSgTis^bsence ' ^ by his 0rder WaS left il1 ch ^ e of , Ko J' 11 t j 1 tu fflc - er left r n L ? ea ^ e in f:,le mi&lt;3(lle of June he remained in complete charge, and the vigour of his administration combined with the thoroughness of that the State was governed by Mohammad bin Ahmad, the Wah of Muttrah, as acting wazir during his absence and the continued able difficulty ln wlth e( l ual success during a period of consider- The situation caused by the attitude of the Sultan and his continued ^ T^ in 0f 0maa ' and above a11 the fact that the British adviser had been able to do sufficient in the way of reform to iustifv bei '' nlade of leaving the State in entire^ Arab hands, now rendered his further employment unnecessary and inadvisable. nnuJ^i! n. att - ttn lKi 0{ tllc Sul t an -) On the 1st October therefore by ^ M f en m a , the acting wazir handed over his functions t on of the'state 18 S create ^ or t ' le P^pose of carrying on the .dminis-58 administration report of the The Council is composed as follows : Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal, President of the Council; Mohammad bin Ahmad, Wall of Muttrah, Einance Minister; Rashid bin Uzzayiz, Qazi of Muscat; Znbeir bin Ali, Minister of Justice. Within their respective spheres the Ministers have complete authority, T&amp;ut all matters of general importaace can only be decided by the Council as such. The Council meets twice a week and a secretary has been appointed. The Political Agent corresponds w th the Council, and the Sultan, except in matters affecting him personally or his family, and in foreign affairs, leaves all administration in their hands. Considering the complete lack of experience of the members, and the disinclination of all Arabs to do any work, the Council may be said to be doing its work as well as can be expected, Tlie Sultan returned to Muscat at the end of November, but has taken no active part in affairs. (c) Administration of justice. It had been remarked in the last report that the court instituted by the Sultan under the presidency of Saiyd Nadir, as one of the conditions of the loan, had not proved a success, largely owing to the dilatory personality of the president. On the arrival of the British adviser Saiyid Nadir resigned and was replaced by Sheikh Zubeir bin AH. Matters, owing to the unnecessary elaborateness of the procedure still however proved unsatisfactory, and on the advice of the Political Agent a simple system was introduced which has worked expeditiously and to the general popular satisfaction. As in all Arabian States the Shara or Qazi^s Court is open to all complaints, written or verbal, civil or criminal. The Qazi decides what he can and sends on those which he does not think suitable to his court to the Adiliyah or court of justice under the presidency of Sheikh Zubeir, which also exercises original jurisdiction on any complaints brought before it. To the Adiliyah are also referred by the Political Agent the cases of British against Arab subjects. In addition to these regular courts there sits once a week a Majlis-al-Tujjar or bench of Arab merchants to whom are referred any complicated commercial cases which the Mahkumah feels it cannot decide. Justice is free with the exception of a small fee for recording com plants in the Adiliyah, and a couct-fee of one per cent on the value of civil suits. The record number of 188 suits by British against Arab subjects have been decided by the Adiliyah, while what is far more remarkable the suits decided between Arabs have been more numerous still, and a certain number of cases involving Omanis have been disposed of. (d) Defence, The institution of some sort of levy to uphold the Sultan's authority and to defend his territories from attack from the interior had been one of the conditions of the loan. The absurdity of the British position in Muscat, where we were maintaining a regiment at great expense for the defence of the rotten and bankrupt administration of an independent State was fully realised, as was the futility of setting up any government or of instituting any reforms which did not aim at making the State self-supporting, self-reliant and self- sufficient. Levies cannot however be created without money. Directly the State finances began to show signs of being able to;meet such a charge, proposals were advanced for the formation of a Baluch levy to be recruited from Mekran or Seistan. The coast population of Oman is largely Baluch, and such a levy while exciting no comment as Baluchis have regularly been employed as guards for centuries by Arab rulers in the Gulf, would prove reliable and loyal compared to the local Arabs, who are intolerant of all form of discipline and treacherous to an unexampled degree.persian gulf political residency, 1920. 59 The approaching disbandment of the Sistan levies favoured the inception of the scheme, and the men, 250, were ready to come when the whole was held up by the discoTery of Gilbertian situation created by the Arms Traffic Oonven- tion of 1919, which, by placing Arabia within the prohibited area, did not make nossible the importation of any arms into Muscat, even by the Sultan, the ruler of an independent State for the purposes of his own defence. The only solution is the adherence of Muscat to the Convention, and it is hoped that this will soon be permitted. TVith the arrival of the levy it will be possible for the British regiment to be withdrawn, especially in view of the peace with Oman which minimises the danger of attack from that quarter. The sole means of transport at the disposal of the local government had been the Sultan's so called yacht, which for many years had been in the pangs of dissolution, and a voyage in which was fraught with the gravest danger. This has been sold as scrap iron, and an order has been placed for a fast sea going motor boat which should be ready early in 1921. This will enable fre quent inspection of the outlying ports. (e) JEducation. If the spasmodic teaching by a Tunisian Arab of about 5U boys in Muscat in the Koran and the elements of addition and substraction be excepted, there is no school either in the Sultan's territory or in Oman proper. Ignorance is incredible, and it is largely due to this and to the disinclination of the Arab of this part of the world to learn, that it is impossible 1 o obtain candidates for Government employ. Trade for the same reason in Muscat and Muttra ha^ passed entirely out of Arab hands. It is stated that there is not an Arab below the age of sixty in the towns who can write one page of correct Arabic. One of the first efforts of the Council should be to start a good school, but no local material is available for teaching, and it is doubtful if qualified men from outside will come however generous the terms offered. (5) The attitude of the Sultan. The character of the present Sultan, once the replica of his father's in its vain pomposity, fantastic ideas of independence, and general obstinacy and incompetence, seemed to have changed during 1919 for the better. The peri lous condition of his state, his impending bankruptcy, and the continued success of the rebels in the interior, had brought home to him his complete dependence upon our support and onr advice. Once he had accepted the terms of the loan in fact, it was he who wished to force the pace, and who pressed for a British adviser. The advice of the Political Agent was always welcomed and accepted without demur. That there was something to account for thi^ change of front was suspected^ and the Sultan when asking to be permitted to visit the Viceroy in India hinted as much. The visit was sanctioned and the Sultan and the Political Agent proceeded to India in March. It was not however till on the veyage that the Sultan confessed to the Political Agent that he wished to ask the Viceroy if he might abdicate. This request he preferred in person to His Excellency in Delhi, but for reasons w T hich are outside the scope of this report the Sultan was told that the idea could not be entertained. He was however permitted to extend his stay in India to three months. This decision was at the time not taken particularly well by the Sultan, and Government were warned that the Sultan would inevi ably endeavour to delay his return to Muscat. The reason for the wish of the Sultan to abdicate were simple. He hated Muscat, was tired of the danger and worry of his position, hankered after civilisation, was thoroughly idle, and had recently married a lovely Circassian from Constantinople who he rightly decided would be out of place in his Muscat harem. .r. j. j x The Sultan was due back in Muscat at the end of June. On that date on the plea of health he fled to Kashmir.60 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE There was no doubt of his intention to evade the orders of Government. It was clearly impolitic to leave a British officer continuously in sole charge of an independent State. However, suitable such a step might have proved for a short time, the continuance of the position could but arouse the most gloomy suspicions in the minds of our enemies, and this at a time when the whole Arab world was in a ferment. In interior Oman crisis succeeded crisis, while in Muscat itself the wildest rumours were prevalent owing to the continuous ab sence of the Sultan, that he had been imprisoned by us and that we were about to take over the country. The Sultan's return, if only for a short time, and the establishment of an Arab form of Government were called for. For this purpose the Political Agent was called to India in August to interview the Sultan. The latter was run to earth in Ambala on the 8th September, and after a lengthy interview he gave instructions for the appointment of Council of Ministers, and agreed to return to Muscat, though he prayed that he should only return for a period of two months each year, three months were however insisted on. Even then it was not till the end of November that the Sultan returned to Muscat on R. I. M. S. Lawrence. His return certainly removed many justifiable apprehensions and created a favourable atmosphere, while his non-interference with his ministers facil^at- ed administration. But it must never be forgotten that abdication is his aim, and that he hopes to be allowed to do this when his son is fit to take his place. An unwilling Sultan he will remain at the request of Government, but as a factor in actual politics or administration he no longer exists. The hope of the State lies in his son Saiyid Said, now only ten. It is hoped that he will shortly join the Chiefs' College at Ajmere. {4) General review. The outstanding events of the year have been the peace with Oman, the rehabilitation of the State finances, and the replacement of rule by the Sultan by rule by a Council of Ministers. These events have been almost revolu tionary, but they have nevertheless been the inevitable outcome of circum stances. The State has made a good start, and in 1921 it will endeavour to stand by itself without our military support. But promising as the future may seem, the foundations will have been built upon sand if adequate person nel is not forthcoming. The younger generation in Muscat does not seem to exist. Of the ministers two are over sixty and three are childless. Incompetent as the Walis of the coast are, were one to resign or to die there would be none to replace him. The actual technical officials of the administration will for several years to come have to be imported from outside, and the most extrava gantly generous terms will not tempt the average qualified man to 'brave ^y no means exaggerated terrors of Muscat. The problem is desperate, but w e must wait and see. Interior Oman may be left to itself. The sole disquieting feature is the state of semi-famine caused by the lack of rain. To this may be added the fall in the purchasing power of the dollar due to the decline of silver. With the appreciated dollar the Omanis had not felt seriously the rise in the price of commodities. Neither in Oman nor in the Sultan's territories is there any immediate cause for apprehension, and South Eastern Arabia is possibly no worse off than many other countries. Ams Traffic There has been no arms traffic. No purchases were made from the Arms Warehouse. 333 British subjects were registered during the year of whom 121 were t , x v . a ' d v • i. . from Gwadur. Total amount of fees British subject 8 and British interesta. n t* tnn collected including fines was Es. 436,persian gulf political residency, 1920. 61 The 2-lst Brahmans were relieved by l-117th Mahrattas from Bushire on „ v 9th May. The latter remained here till British Troops. the end of the year. During the year under report proposals were put up for increasing the pay and the establishment of the Agency. Statistics show that the volume of work c , . has almost doubled since 1912, while the Agency Staff, etc. . - . . '■ prices of necessaries have more than doubled. Relief was previously granted by the compensation given for the high rate of the dollar, but with the rapidly falling exchange this has become inadequate. Considerable repairs have been undertaken as regards buildings. It is in teresting to note that two excellent rooms were discovered filled with lumber some 23 years old which on cleaning out have furnished a good guard room anM store. An investigation of the stationery scattered about the Agency showed 5 years store at least had been unwittingly accumulated. Means of transport for the Political Agent continue a difficulty. As present he is the possessor of a debilitated jolly boat seating with difficulty his emaciated form and possibly one other person, propelled at about 2 miles an hour by two fever-stricken khallasis. A steam tug was sent from Basra early in the year but proved unsuitable, and expensive. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has recommended that a small motor launch be supplied to the Political Agent, which would permit him to make short trips up and down the coast in fine weather. Touring is necessary for the work and advantageous for the health of the Political Agent. With the very unfrequent visits of His Majesty's Ships it is impossible for him to obtain lifts on these as formerly. The Hon'ble the Political Resident kindly sanctioned the purchase of an outboard motor. This has proved most useful for visiting ships and for har bour work. The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Vi&amp;it9 Resident in the Persian, Gulf paid three visits to Muscat during the year as follows :— Date of arrival Date of departure. 10-4-1920 10-4-1920 31-10-1920 1-11-1920 28-11-1920 28-11-1920 Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. T. Wilson, K.C.I.E., C.S.T., C.M.G., D.S.O., who was travelling in R. I. M. S. Laxorence landed at the Agency on 1st November. His Excellency Rear Admiral Sir Hugh Tothill, K.C.B., Naval Com mander-in-Chief of East Indies Squadron, arrived on 26th February on board the flagship Highflyer, After exchanging visits with His Highness the Sultan of Muscat on 27th left for Karachi. Mr. E. E. Gunter, Director, Indo-European Telegraphs, arrived in I. E. T. S. on 15th December and after paying a visit to the Political Agent left for Jask the same day. Mr. Crossle, Executive Engineer, Persian Gulf, arrived on 17th November and left on 19th. Mr. S. S. Stout, Deputy Director, Postal Services, Persian Gulf, arrived on 28th April and left on 6th May. Slave Trade. 13 slaves took refuge in the Consulate, of whom 11 were manumitted. A serious case of kidnapping from Wadham occurred in March. The slaves and dealers succeeded in escaping finally into Bareimi. The incident caused the Kazm affair. It is almost impossible to trace slaves once they are taken into the hinterland.62 administration report of the i The price of dollars varied constantly during the year due to the fluctua tion of the silver market. Trade. The average monthly rates were :— J armary February March April , May . June . July . August September •October November December Re. 256 per 100 dollars. •242 239-5 226 213 193 207 208-2 „ 206-2 „ 213 215 204 Por the year ending 31st March 1920 imports, for Muscat and Muttra only, amounted to Rs. 39,20,444 and exports to Es. 43,15,080 as compared to Us. 43,49,471 and Rs. 36,34,842 last year. The total volume of trade therefore remains about the same. Trade is now almost entirely concentrated in British Indian hands, and the Arab merchants of Sur are now the sole survisors of the enterprising Omani traders of former days. Even the Arab merchants of the interior are not traders in the true sense of the term, as they only buy and sell from the Banians and Khojas of Muscat and Muttra who absolutely control prices and supplies. The lack of rain affected the date crop slightly, and t^e supply of fodder and locally grown cereals seriously. The price of camels has gone down 50 per cent, due to the lack of fodder and the poverty on the Trucial coast, caused by the stagnation in the pearl market, which has greatly diminished the demand. The slump in prices at the end of the year resulted in merchants being left with considerable stocks of rice which they had bought in anticipation of the continuance of high prices. There is therefore a momentary cessation of imports, holders of stocks endeavouring to keep up prices by artificial scarcity and so to save as much as possible of their losses. This combined with the decreased purchasing power of the dollar due to the fall in the exchange has reacted somewhat hardly on the poorer classes. There has been a remarkable decline in the trade and population of Muscat during the year, at the expense of the neighbouring port of Muttra. The trade of Muscat with the cessation of the arms traffic has been confined for some time to the supply of interior Oman and the Oman coast. !Por this purpose Muttra is far better adapted than Muscat as it is in direct communica tion by caravan road with the interior and more suitable for sailing vessels. jj J ost of Muscat is now empty and in ruins and the value of house property has greatly decreased, while the reverse is the case in Muttra. Ichabod may well be added to the numerous names that adorn its red hot rocks. Monsieur Vadala, Prench Consul at Bombay, arrived here on 2nd December and left with Monsieur Yvoneou on 20th December for Bombay. The affairs of the French Consulate and Coal Depot have been wound up and the depot leased to His Britannic Majesty's Government from 1st January 1921 for the period of a year, charge of the Mission.

Administration Report of the Bahrain Political Agency for the year C 1920 - L—P ersonnel. Charge of the Political Agency was held by Major Dickson, C.I E., till 28th November 19^0. Prom 29th November the charge was held by Khan Sahib Sayyad Saddiq Hasan, the Indian Assistant. II.— S heikh I sa and A l- K halifah P amilt. Eelations with Sheikh Isa have continued fairly satisfactory with the exception of the following few cases:— (1) Sheikh Isa imprisoned a Persian who had settled down in Qatar and latterly in Muharraq for alleged embezzlement of money belong- mm in s : to , a ? Arab merchant who had complained to Sheikh Isa. i,^ The Political Agent demanded the man's release and asked that M the case be sent to the Agency for investigation. At first Sheikh Isa refused to release the man on the plea that he was from Qatar and domiciled in Bahrain; but on further demand Sheikh Isa asked that he should be put in direct telegraphic com munication with Government of India. It was pointed out that * k the Bahrain Order in Council clearly laid down the procedure in such cases, but if he wanted to make any representation to Gov- ernment it should be sent to Political Agent who would forward it to higher authorities as usual. Eventually Sheikh Isa released rife; the Persian concerned and sent him to the Agency and the case i U ,^ was preceded with in the ordinary way. (2) In the second case a Shiah Bahrani of village Sinabis (four miles from Manamah) a subject of Sheikh Isa, took refuge in the Agency as his house had been surrounded by the Pidawis of Sheikh Abdullah-bin Isa who had ordered the Bahrani to produce a bif and valuable pearl purchased from Qatif. Sheikh Abdullah's avowed object in ordering the production of this pearl was to levy a large amount as zaka or royalty which is customarily taken by the Sheikh on an unusually big pearl when one is found in the Bahrain Pisheries or purchased in Bahrain or its territorial waters; while the Bahrani was afraid, in light of past ex perience of some of his class, that once the pearl got out of his hands it would never be returned by Sheikh Abdullah. He refused therefore to take it to Sheikh Abdullah and shut himsslf up in his house, escaping at night when it was being surrounded by Fidawis with the object of taking the pearl forcibly. As a refugee he was allowed to stop in the Agency for the night and sent to Sheikh Isa next morning with a message that the Political Agent expected that he would not be wronged or persecuted, but treated in a just and honourable way. Sheikh Isa and his son Sheikh Abdullah were greatly chagrined, but left the Bahrani unmolested and he was enabled to take his pearl to Bombay for (3) Government's decision on the four requests made in London by Sheikh Abdullah on behalf of his father was conveyed in June. As was to be expected each of the four requests was disallowed by Government as unreasonable and Sheikh Isa and his sons were extremely disappointed and showed their disappointment and66 administration report of the irritation in a number of petty ways, chiefly by trying to persuade gome of the ignorant foreigners to take their cases and complaints to Sheikh Isa and his officials till at last the Sheikh was reminded of the decision that his jurisdiction was limited to natives of Bahrain, while all foreigners including Arabs from the neigh bouring districts were under the Political Agent s jurisdiction as British protected persons. Since then (November) there has been no more attempt of this kind on the part of Sheikh Isa or bis sons. (4) A Nai U woman apparently flying from her husband who threatened to murder her for alleged misconduct, took refuge m the Agency. The Political Agent tried to have her protected by the Dosan headman of the village of Budayya where her husband lived; but as the headman did not accept the responsibility, she was given a paper to show that she had sought protection of the Agency and her complaint was to be enquired into, and forbidding any one to molest her. She put up with some friends m Manamah where her husband found her and on the pretence of making a recon ciliation entered her compartment and murdered her with a knife. The matter was reported to Sheikh Isa who refused to arrest the murderer and his friends and strongly objected to the Political Agent's action claiming that the woman was one of his own subiects and as such should not have been given protection, etc. The case was submitted to higher authorities. Ibis ga\e rise to a petition which was prepared at the instigation of certain disaffected persons including Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Isa signed only by Arabs of Muharraq and addressed to Sir Percy Cox. ft re ported to comnlain against the Political^ Agent, Major Dickson, for so-called high-hinded actions like building an aerodrome and blocking a public road, starting a Municipality with consequent rates, and curtailing their liberties, etc., etc. Sheikh Isa was led to support the petition which he sent to the Eesident with a letter in much the same strain. (5) At the instance of some of his subjects Bin Saud protested against the 6 per cent, duty charged by Sheikh Isa on goods consigned to Hasa and Qatif and demanded a rebate. When this was pointed out to Sheikh Isa and a reasonable reduction suggested, he showed much irritation and refused to allow any reduction. The matter was submitted to Government and with some difficulty the Sheikh finally agreed to charge 2 per cent, on such transit goods and Rs 20 per bale of piee s-goods. This be aiso considers unfair and due to the instigations of His Majesty's Government's representa- tive. III.—Victoria Memorial Hospital. Assistant Surgeon G. K.

Bahrain had not been repaired till then the journey both ways was performed in a sailing boat in spite of the Shimal. The Political Agent accompanied the Deputy Resident in the R.I.M.8. .Lawrence II to Qatar on 2^th April returning on the 30th April after investing Sheikh Abdullah-bin Jasim-ath-Thani with the insignia of C.I.E. As the Lawrence went aground immediately on arrival in Doha harbour it was not possible to land at Qatar and the Sheikh was invested on board. Qatif was visited by the Political Agent, Major Dickson, in September. The Political Agent accompanied Sir Percy Cox to meet Bin Saud in Ojair on 26th returning on 29th September. V.—B in Saud. Major H. E. P. Dickson, C.I.E., left for Hassa to meet Bin Saud on 29th January. He was accompanied by Mr. Yusif bin Ahmad Kanoo, M.B.E., and Abdul Aziz Quasaibi, Bin Saud's Agent in Bahrain. Bin Saud chiefly repre sented his troubles with the Sharif of Mecca arising out of the dispute over the districts of Khurma and Tarabah which had led to constant friction, inter tribal raids and mutual incriminations on the part of these two chiefs, and expressed his foar of losing control over the Akhwan who bad not been allowed to perform the pilgrimage and were threatening to do so by force. He also asked for an enhanced subsidy to help him to meet the increased expenditure incurred in keeping the border tribes under control and ensuring peace in Central Arabia as also for paying off a heavy debt contracted by him during the war. Bin Saud, further, requested Government to arbitrate in the matter of Khurmah and Tarabah. As result of these appeals. Bin Saud's subsidy of £5,000, which was going to be discontinued or reduced by one-half, was con tinued. The Sharif was moved to agree to a personal meeting with Bin Saud who eventually consented to go with a limited following, perform the Hajj and then meet the Sharif at Taif or Sail with a view to essaying a friendly settle ment. Bin Saud asked that an Indian Muslim officer be sent with him and Khan Sahib Syed Siddiq Hassan, Indian Assistant, Bahrain, was deputed. In the meantime, Bin Saud changed his mind on the plea of being unable to go with so small a following as Government had advised, at the Sharif's request. He was at last persuaded to send his eousin Ahmad Thanaiyan as-Saud with only 40 Nejdis. After the Hajj, a preliminary agreement was signed in Mecca on 4th September 1920 by which both sides undertook to close all hostilities, tribal raids or agitation, and to endeavour re-establish friendly relations between Nejd and Hejaz pending the final settlement of the disputed areas of Khurma and Tarabah, etc., to be made under the auspices of His Britannic Majesty's Government. Bin Saud has also had trouble with three other neighbouring chiefs, Ibn Rashid, Ibn Sabah of Koweit and Ibn 'Aayidah of 'Assir. The causes or motives, in each case, were similar, namely, the growing strength of the fanatical Akhwan movement in Nejd and Bin Saud's half-concealed ambitions to subjugate the whole or greater part of Arabian Peninsula, which are avowedly curtailed only by his desire to respect his treaty obligations with the British Government whose friendship he cherishes above all. He not infre quently writes to the Political Agent and High Commissioner, Baghdad, that if Government cannot help him to solve his political and financial difficulties he should be told so, and then he would sweep away all his enemies for whom he is more than a match. The Akhwan, who now comprise all the Kejdrs, Eadhar and Badu together with a large number of Hejaz border- tribes freshly won over partly by proselytizing, partly by subsidising, have during July to September last succeeded in over-running Assir and taking Ebha, the ruler Mohammed bin 'Aayidh having been brought away to Riyadh where he is still a prisoner. The expedition against Ibn Rashid and Shammar in May- June 1920 was lead by Bin Suad's eldest son Saud and was less successful. A severe fight took place in which both sides claimed victory. Bin Saud's losses were, however, said to be comparatively small and a booty of two thousand68 administration report of the camels was secured by Saud. Another force employed during the same operation, however, received a considerable set-back. In the third case of Koweit, there was fighting at Safah and Jahrah where the Akhwan under Eaisal-ad-Dawish had some initial success, but eventually lost heavily and retired on being warned by Government by means of a com munique dropped from an aeroplane that any attack or advance on Koweit would be opposed by British forces. The dispute was then submitted to Gov ernment for arbitration and the High Commissioner invited Bin Saud to meet Sheikh Salim at Basrah, but Bin Saud could not come owing to ill-health, so the question had to stand over till a more favourable opportunity should occur. One of Bin Saud's requests made during the year was for a permanant doctor for Riyadh where there is none except an Arab of Mosul by name Abdullah Effendi who came out from Constantinople a few years ago but is not regarded as an efficient medical man. Attempts were made through the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to send a suitable Muslim doctor but none could be found and Bin Saud had to content himself with the American Mission doctor's visit. The latter though much resorted to for medical assistance had con tinually to run the gauntlet of unpleasant epithets such as ' Kafir,' etc., and a frequent show of discourtesy from the mass of the Akhwan, so that the post for a permanant doctor would be no sinecure. Bin Saud has expressed a desire to improve the port of Ojair by building a wharf and a beacon and to arrange for fortnightly calls of the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers in order to faciliate the import of goods from India direct, as at present Hassa and Nejd depend for their imports on Bahrain and Koweit. It remains to be decided, after a survey as to which of the ports of Ojair, Juball and Qatif is the more suitable for cargo steamers to visit. The approaches to these ports are very shallow so that even small craft have to lie off 7 or 8 miles. Bin Saud has been granted a special aid or gift of ,£5,000 and the insignia of G.C.I.E., as a token of His Majesty's Government's appreciation of his friendship and loyalty. VI.—Epidemic and Quarantine. Dr. G. K. Monani, Medical Officer, Victoria Memorial Hospital, has carried on the duties of the Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. In December 1920 His Excellency the Sheikh engaged Dr. Maulvi Abdur Razzaq Naqshbandi, L. M. &amp; S., for the quarantine work but formal charge was not taken by him till after the close of the year. The Islands remained free from epidemic diseases of any kind. Epidemic plague which used to recur every alternate year since 1907 has not made its appearance for the last three years. VII.—Hassa and Qatif. The Hassa-Riyadh trade route was completely safe throughout the year. VIII.—Q atar. Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.L, C.I.E., visited Qatar on 29th April. He was accompanied by Major Dickson, the Political Agent. Colonel Trevor presented Sheikh Abdullah bin Jasim al-Thani with the insignia of C.I.E., on the Durbar Deck of R.I.M.S. Lawrence il. As Sheikh Abdullah left the ship the newly sanctioned salute of 7 guns was fired. IX.—Local Officials and Majlis-al-Urfi.

On the whole arrangements made by this firm are satisfactory. Very friendly connections exist between Director of Customs and the Agency. XIV.— Clerk's Quarters. There is urgent need for Clerk's quarters to be built. Houses in town are not available except at a very high rental as merchants, who come in the pearling season pay good rates for the whole year though they stay only a few months.70 administration report of the XV.—General Trade. Trade generally was satisfactory. The establishment of the Eastern Bank in June relieved the difficulty as regards obtaining cash for the pearl trade. The pearl market, however, was dull on account of the lack of demand in Europe. XVI.—H onours. The title of Khan Sahib was conferred on the following on New Year's Day :— (1) Syed Siddiq Hassan, Indian Assistant, Bahrain. (2) Abdul Hussain Hebatullah, a merchant of Bahrain. The title of Rai Sahib was also conferred on the same occasion on Naraindas Tikamdas Mehraj. The Insignia of K.O.I.E. conferred on Sheikh Isa, C.8.I., Ruler of Bahrain in 1919, was presented to him by Brevet-Colonel Arnold Wilson, Civil Com missioner, Mesopotamia, on 29th October. Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.L, C.I.E., was also present on the occasion. The insignia of G.C.I.E. was presented to Sheikh Sir Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, Ruler of Nejd at Ojair, by Sir Percy Cox on 26th September. This title was special and conferred on Ibn Saud in recognition of his statesmanlike conduct in connection with the disputes between himself and King Hussain of Mecca. XVII.—A erodrome. The Civil Commissioner,(Baghdad, sanctioned the laying out of an aeroplane ground, and plot measuring 650 yards long and 400 yards broad was reserved by Sheikh Sir Isa for the purpose. Pillars, the central white circle and T. cloth were made at a cost of about Rs. 500 and the ground was ready in April 1920. In June Air Vice-Marshall Sir W. G. Salmond visited Bahrain and asked to increase the width of the ground. The Civil Commissioner sanctioned a further sum of Rs. 400 for this. This work could not be carried out during the year. XVIII.—M unicipal Sanitation. A Municipality for the town of Manamah (Bahrain) was established on 1st July 1920. The composition of the-CJouncil is eight members of whom four are Sheikh's subjects and four foreign subjects with Sheikh Abdullah, C.I.E., as President, The Secretary is a British subject by name Mohammed Roshan Akhtar. During the five months of the year the Municipality did a good deal of useful work. Several new roads have been constructed, narrow alleys closed, several big wells dug for drainage purposes and heaps of rubbish removed from town. XIX.—J udicial. The work of the Joint Court and the other Courts was satisfactory. The Majlis-al-urfi which was discontinued last year was restarted on 23rd January 1920. Two statements showing the number of cases decided by each Court are attached herewith. XX.—C limate. Rainfall during 1920 was less than the average. The heat and dampness' prevailing in summer were very trying especially during the months of July to September. C. K.

Mylrea, of the American Mission, remained in medical charge of the Agency throughout the year. Condition of Country. The year has been marked by very strained relations between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Ibn Sa'ud. On the 18th April the Sheikh of Kuwait repre- yented that he had received a report to the effect that Ibn Sa'ud had instructed Ibn Shuqair, of the Mutair tribe and a staunch member of the Ikhwan sect, to build houses and settle with his followers at Jariyah, a hundred miles south of Kuwait, which the Sheikh claimed as being within his territory. He stated that he could not vouch for the truth of the report, and did not wish his communication to be taken as a complaint against Ibn Sa'ud, but that he was afraid that if such encroachments were made, they would lead to troubles between Ibn Sa'ud and himself. Six days later he formally requested that His Majesty's Government would address Bin Sa'ud with a view to preventing this encroachment in his territory, and asked that early action might be taken as the tension between Ibn Sa'ud and himself was increasing, and the former's tribes had started robbing caravans and murdering travellers in Kuwait territory. On the 3rd May he asked if any action had been taken, and said that he was anxious to know, as it was customary for his tribes to camp at Jariyah and the neighbouring wells in the summer. He was told that the Civil Commissioner considered the matter one for friendly negotiations in the first instance between him and Ibn Sa'ud. On the 12tli May Shaikh Salim called on the Head Clerk and pointed out that his relations with Ibn Sa'ud were so impaired that he considered it impossible to settle the matter without the intervention of His Majesty's Government. He showed him the correspondence which had passed between them in the beginning of 1919 regarding Balbul, 135 miles south south-east of Kuwait, where Sheikh Salim had then purposed building a house, a procedure to which Ibn Sa'ud had objected, which showed that there was practically a dead-lock between them. He said that, notwithstanding all this, he had taken our advice and made friendly representations to Ibn Sa'ud, through the latter's agent here and others. He said that when His Majesty's Government had ordered him not to build at Balbul he had at once stopped doing so, and he asked that similar orders might be given to Ibn Sa'ud regarding Jariyah, and that Ibn Sa'ud might be told what the Kuwait boundaries were. On the 25th May the Political Agent conveyed the Civil Commissioner's reply to Shaikh Salim, to the effect that he had carefully considered the question raised by him regarding his frontiers, but did not see his way to address Ibn Sa'ud in a letter for the moment, until he received his reply to a letter which he had sent him, inviting him to a conference to settle various matters outstanding between himself and King Husain. He hoped that this conference would take place within the next few months and he would then make it his business to see that the interests of Kuwait were adequately represented.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1920. 73 Meanwhile, on the ISth May, an encounter took place at Hamdh, fifteen miles east of Jariyah, where Shaikh Da'ij, who was in charge of Shaikh Salim's flag in the desert, was surprised and routed by Paisal ad-Dawish, the paramount Sheikh of the Mutair, and a party of his Ikhwan tribesmen. The casualties amongst Da'ij's men were heavy and he himself narrowly escaped, his camp and a large number of camels falling into the hands of the Ikhwan. Ibn Sa'ud's version of the incident, as given by his agent in Eahrain and in a letter, dated 26th May, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, was that Jariyah, which he maintains is in his territory and not that of Kuwait, was a recognised camping ground of the Mutair, and that he had recently given permission for a section of them, under Ibn Shuqair, to settle there. The Shaikh of Kuwait had sent them camel raiders, but without any letters, to tell them to go away. Ibn Shuqair had replied that Ibn Sa'ud, and not the Shaikh of Kuwait, was his Chief and that he would refer to him. Shaikh Salim had been very angry on hearing this and had declared war on the Mutair. He had issued a prohibi tion against the export of grain, etc., to Ibn Sa'ud's subjects, and ordered Shaikh Da'ij to take action against the Mutair. Ibn Shuqair, fearing for his women folk had appealed to his kinsmen for help, and had also written to Ibn Sa'ud, who had ordered him not to proceed north of Jariyah, but to defend himself if attacked there. Da'ij had then camped at Hamdh, and had sent out a patrol from there towards Jariyah, which had given rise to the fight. The Shaikh of Kuwait, on the other hand, maintains that Faisal ad- Dawish's attack on Da'ij was entirely unprovoked. On the 1st June he sent a deputation to Raiyadh, with a letter to Ibn Sa'ud complaining of Dawish's action and asking him to order Dawish to return the property which he had taken and to make restitution for the men whom he had killed. He said that, as Dawish was Ibn Sa'ud's subject, he was reporting ihe matter J co him instead of taking action himself. He reminded him of the long standing friendship between the Sa'ud and Subah families, and said that he felt sure that, once he knew the true facts of the case, Dawish's action would annoy Ibn Sa'ud even more than it did him. The deputation returned to Kuwait on the 2nd July accompanied by Nasir bin Sa'ud al-Erahan, who was the bearer of a long letter from Ibn Sa'ud, dated the 2lst June. He said in it that he had not ordered Eaisal ad-Dawish to attack, nor wished him to do so, but had, of course, known that the Mutair were concentrating and taking defensive measures. As God had ordained the incident, however,. he was not sorry, for reasons which he would explain : Ever since Salim had become Shaikh of Kuwait, not a month had passed without his experiencing worry at his hands for no reason whatever. During the past three months there had been five such cases, viz :— (1) He had sent a mounted force to threaten the people of Jariyah without first communicating with him. (2) When Ibn Sa'ud's Agent at Kuwait had gone to Riyadh, he had sent him a verbal message by him, and had not had the courtesy to write a line. (3) He had sent him no message when some Mutair and Ajman had been caught raiding at his instigation. (4) He had issued an order in Kuwait prohibiting all exports to Ibn Sa'ud's ports. (5) He had declared war on the Mutair. He asked for an explanation of these five points, and said that if Shaikh Salim had any claims to put forward which he did not know, let him state them. If he claimed that the British had given him Jariyah, he was quite billing that they should decide the matter as he knew how to answer them. In the old days there had never been any friction between the Sa'ud and Subah families regarding their frontiers and tribes, as the former had controlled the tribes and the latter had remained in Kuwait itself. Then, when evil days fell on Najd and the country was split up, one portion coming under the Turks and in part under the 'Ajman, and the other under Ibn Rashid, people who were74 administration report of the discontented witli this used to take refuge in Kuwait as the people were the same. It was his father, the late Shaikh Mubarak, who had first started taking zahai from the tribes, and he (Ibn Sa'ud) had raised no objection because of the close friendship. When he died certain of the tribes had come back to him of their own accord. There would never have been any question of frontiers between them, had not Sheikh Salim in his greed raised it by claiming this and that tract of country as bis own. He demanded that Shaikh Salim should sign a declaration binding himself not to encroach on his rights regarding his frontiers and tribes according to the old custom. He said that if he refused to sign this paper, and annoyed him again, he would at once take action. He returned a small portion of the property taken at Hamdh, but made the signing of the above paper a condition for the return of the rest. Shaikh Salim asked for the advice of His Majesty's Government as to how he should reply to Ibn Sa'ud's demand, and said that he saw no prospect of an honourable peace except through British assistance. He laid great emphasis on the fact that the territory under dispute was clearly his in accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. He was told that the Civil Commissioner's advice to him was to politely refuse to sign the document, and to invoke the friendly arbitration of the British Government, agreeing not to take any further action regarding Jariyah pending such negotiation. At the same time it was pointed out to him that the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913 was not a document to which he was actively party, and that, in any case it was drawn up under very different circumstances from the present, when the Turks were still in Hasa, and that it had been superseded by Clause VI of our Agreement of 26th December with Ibn Sa'ud, according to ^hich the frontier between Kuwait and Ibn Sa'ud's territory was still to be determined. Shaikh Salim was bitterly disappointed by this reply. He said that the idea of His Majesty's Government not considering the terms of the Anglo- Turkish Convention as still binding had never entered his head, as he had been definitely told by previous Political Agents that the territory allotted to him therein was his beyond dispute. He certainly believed what he said, and seemed to look on it as a distinct breach of faith on the part of Government to repudiate the Convention now. Thinking, therefore, that there was noihing to be hoped for from His Majesty's Government, he decided, before asking for arbitration, to try and patch up the quarrel with Ibn Sa'ud over the restitution question, preferring to leave the frontier undecided than to have it decided against him. He probably hoped that Ibn Sa'ud would be more likely to agree to his terms and order Paisal ad-Da wish to return the plunder than he had been before, as a report had just been received that his forces had been severely defeated by Ibn Eashid at Shu'aibah, near Hail, in the middle of June. Envoys from Ibn Bashid, announcing this and saying that the Shammar were mobilis ing against Ibn Sa'ud, had arrived in Kuwait on the 4th July—their arrival being rather dramatic, as Nasir bin Sa'ud al-Earhan happened to be sitting with Shaikh Salim at the time. Accordingly, instead of asking for the good offices of His Majesty's Government as he had been advised to do, he wrote another letter, dated 14th July, to Ibn Sa'ud, in which he said that he saw no object in bringing up past events and asking and giving explanations, as, were both of them to do this, it would take a long time. He had never mentioned the subject of boundaries and subjects in his letter of 1st June, as it was well known who his subjects were, and his frontier was that fixed ' by the two Governments' (i.e., in the Anglo-Turkish Convention). He was surprised that Ibn Sa'ud had not agreed to his request that he should order Dawish to make restitution, and felt sure that it must be because he had believed the false reports of evilly disposed people who were trying to cause ill will between them. Regarding the paper which he had demanded he should sign, he yaid he was sure that if Ibn Sa'ud thought the matter over carefully he w T ould see the advantage of remaining friends as in the past and would abandon his demand. He said that, as he had said in his previous letter, he could not take action against Dawish without letting Ibn Sa'ud know, althougflipersian &lt;gulf political residency, 1920. 75 able to do so. He thanked him for the return of the camels, etc., which he had sent, and trusted that he would now order the return of the rust of the property, as he could not hold him excused if he were to make any further objection. At the same time he issued a proclamation in Kuwait, forbidding people to talk about Ibn vSa 'ud, as, he said, he wished to ayoid all risk of rumours reaching Ibn Sa'ud that the people were speaking ill of him. Ibn Sa'ud was extremely angry at Shaikh Salim's reply and wrote a long letter to the Political Agent, Bahrain, in which he accused Shaikh Salim of having altered his letter before showing it to the Political Agent, Kuwait, of having treated his envoy, Nasir, with disrespect, of having arranged for men of his own to impersonate the envoys from Ibn Hashid mentioned above, etc. He said that as Shaikh Salim by his reply had refused the olive branch, he had severed relations with him. If His Majesty's Government considered that British interests were affected, let her fix frontier between Najd and Kuwait. If, on the other hand, she did not wish to interfere, let her say su, and he would make his own arrangements. He asked for a reply one w T ay or the^ other as soon as possible, and added that personally he would like His Majesty s Govern ment to settle the dispute. His reply to Shaikh Salim, which just fell short of being a declaration of war, was received in Kviwait on the 14ith August, and the following day the Sheikh called on the Political Agent and asked for the good offices of His Majesty's Government to settle the dispute. On the 29th August Shaikh Salim was informed that, subject to the concurrence of His Majesty's Government to whom he was making reference on the subject, the Civil Commissioner agreed to appoint an arbitrator early in the autumn, to decide upon the territory at issue between them provided that both he and Ibn Sa'ud (to whom the same message was being conveyed) agreed in advance in writing to accept, each for his own lifetime on^ his own behalf and that of his people, the decision of the Arbitrator, and to give effect thereto. Meanwhile it was essential that both parties should keep the peace, and neither countenance any sort of agression. Shaikh Salim replied that, in addition to the question of the frontier between his territory and Najd, he had other disputes with Ibn Sa'ud which required settling before a real peace was possible, viz-t Paisal ad-Dawish s attack on Hamdh in May and the question of restitution for the lives and property lost; Ibn Sa'ud's action in taking zakat from the 'Awazim ; and the raids by Ibn Sa'ud's tribes on his own. This point was considered, and he was told on 8th September, that the question of Dawish's attack was so bound up with the boundary question that it would be included in the Arbitration, but that the other two questions could not be included, as it had always been the custom for Bedouin tribes to pay zakat to whomsoever they thought best able to protect them from their enemies at the time being, or to him who had sufficient power or prestige to enforce its payment. .Raids and counter-raids too, were normal routine in Arabia and it was improbable that any amount of Arbitration would stop them. On the 17th September Shaikh Salim submitted a long letter, accepting all the questions of Arbitration laid down by Government, and, as both parties had also been asked to do, stating the frontier which he claimed and the reasons on which based his claim. He claimed:—The islands of Musalla- miyah and Jinnah. Erom the coast, west of the island of Jinnah, through the village of Anta', the wells of Wabrah, Habah, Qar'ah, Safah and Hafar al-Batin, all inclusive, and thence north-east along the Batin. He said that the islands of Musallamiyah and Jinnah had for years been resorted to by Kuwait pearl divers, and might be described as their port. They had always been counted as belonging to the Buler of Kuwait up to the year 1902, when the Turks established a post there. Regarding Anta'; he said that its inhabitants always, resort to Kuwait they engage in the pearl diving wdth the people of Kuwait, and all their work is connected with Kuwait. He said that the tribes which drink from the above mentioned wells want him and not Ibn Sa'ud, and that until the present dispute arose and trade was stopped, caravans from Kuwait were under his protection until they arrived at these wells. The above frontier less the Islands of Musallamiyah76 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE and Jinnah was that allotted to Kuwait by the Anglo-Turkish Conyention when the Turks were still in Hasa. It was subsequent to this that Ibn Sa'ud conquered Hasa, and when he did, it was with the help of Kuwait. He agreed with the ruling that the question of zakat and raids could not be included in the Arbitration, but, as he feared that they might become cause of dispute between Ibn Sa'ud and himself in the future, he said he hoped that Govern ment would give him her assistance at the time of the Arbitration in forming a treaty with Ibn Sa'ud with a view to maintaining peace and removing all causes of disagreement between them. Ibn Sa'ud's reply, dated the 5th September, was received at Bahrain also on the 17th September. He too accepted all conditions as laid down provided His Majesty's Government guaranteed no hostile act against his borders pending the decision of Government. Regarding the boundary between his territory and Kuwait, he claimed the whole country up to the walls of Kuwait, on the ground that all this had belonged to his grandfather and great-grand father between the temporary intiusion of the Turks, at which time he said, the •Sheikhs of Kuwait only held jurisdiction in the town itself. Meanwhile, ever since receipt of Ibn Sa'ud's last letter, Sheikh Salim had boen making preparations for war so as to be ready in the event of Ibn Sa'ud making a move before arbitration could be arranged. All minor raids which took place were attributed locally to Ibn Sa'ud's instigation, as also was an alleged case of piracy against a Kuwait pearling boat. The boat in question, a shu'ai, returned to Kuwait on the 12th September, and, according to the statement of crew, the incident took place on the 28th August. The men said that while they were taking on board fresh water from a spring in the sea, known as Ghamisah, off the coast of Jubail, two boats approached them, one from each side, and opened fire on them. The nakhuda was killed and the rest of the crew jumped overboard. The pirates then boarded the shu'ai and helped themselves to everything on board, including cash to the value of Rs.1,400 and their pearls, after which they promised the crew their lives if they went on board again. The crew went on board and were taken to Jubail, where they were kept under an escort on their shu'ai for eight days, while the Amir of Jubail apparently communicated with Ibn Jilawi. At^the end of that period they were released and their property was returned to them. The Political Agent, Kuwait, examined twelve of the crew independently and could detect no sign of their story being a fabrication. According to the Jubai version however, as told to the Political Agent, Bahrain, the whole affair was merely a fracas over water and there was no question of piracy at all. Whichever story was true there was, of courre, no reason to suppose that Ibn Sa'ud him self was implicated. Similarly Ibn Sa'ud brought various complaints against Sheikh Salim. On 18th August he wrote that he had approached Ibn Tawalah and other Shammar with a view to stirring up strife against him-Ibn Tawalah had arrived in Kuwait as Shaikh Salim's guest at the end of July. In his letter of 5th September he complained of a raiding party under Da'ij and Ibn Tawalah, which Shaikh Salim had sent from Jahrah. This party had also been reported by the Sheikh of Bahrain as having come south, apparently with the avowed intentions of attacking Jariyah. There can be no question that such a party did go, and it was never denied in Kuwait, but there it was described as a reconnaissance and not a raiding party. He also wroto to the Political Agent, Bahrain, on 13th September, enclosing a letter dated 8th Sepl ember, from Ibn Shuquair regarding a raid by Ibn Tawalah, £ Ali al-Khalifah, and other members of the Subah family, which probably refers to the same party. On the 20th September Shaikh Salim assured the Political Agent that he had then none nearer the frontier than Jahrah, except for a few parties of scouts, and guaranteed that in future no such party should exceed five men. A letter, dated 8th September, from Ibn Sa'ud to Ibn Shuqair regarding the fortification of Jariyah, which was intercepted by one of Shaikh Salim's patrols, caused great indignation in Kuwait in view of the fact that it was written affer Ibn Sa'ud had accepted the conditions of Arbitration laid down by Government.persian gulf political residency, 1920. V7 The High Commissioner discussed the matter with Sheikh on the 30th September, and warned him that his war-flag and forces at Jahrah were merely incitement to the Ikhwan to attack, and that he had far better demobilize and trust to our peaceful interveniton. Sheikh Salim did not see things in the same light. On the 8th October a report was received in Kuwait that a large force of Ikhwan, which subsequently proved to consist of about four thousand men under Faisal ad-Da wish, had left Wafrah for Subaihiyah the previous evening. Sheikh Salim was at Jahrah at the time, and, as soon as he received this information, made preparations for the defence of the village, and also ordered the newly-built town wall of Kuwait to be manned. At 6 a. m . on the 10th October the Ikhwan attacked Jahrah. Shaikh Salim's force was holding the south-west face of the village, with Ibn Tawalah's mounted Shammar on the right flank and Da'ij's horsemen on the left. The Ikhwan launched their attack on the western end of the position, and, after routing the Shammar^ turned the position from the north-west. By 9 a. m . the entire village was in the hands of the Ikhwan and Shaikh Salim, with the other Sheikhs and about six hundred men, was shut up in the fort to the south-west of the village, the rest of his force being dispersed. In the afternoon Faisal ad-Dawish sent a message to Shaikh Salim offer ing him peace if he would evacuate the fort forthwith and renounce all claims to the camels, etc., which the Ikhwan had taken, but Shaikh Salim refused. During the night the Ikhwan made three determined attacks on the fort, but failed to take it. Meanwhile very great nervousness was evident in Kuwait, and the wildest rumours were current. An immediate attack on Kuwait was feared, and eyery available man was sent to man the wall. On the morning of the 11th October Sheikh Ahmad al-Jabir, who was in command in Kuwait, organized and despatched a relief force. About six hundred men were sent by sea in the Sheikh's steam launch ' Mishrif ' and a few sailing boats, and at the same time, Ibn Tawalah and a party of mounted men went out by road. Before these reinforcements arrived, however, Faisal ad-Dawish sent an 'alim, named Sulaiman, to Shaikh Salim with definite proposals of peace. He demanded that Shaikh Salim should put down all smoking, drinking, gambling and prostitution in Kuwait. Shaikh Salim replied that he too disap proved of all these things and that he was quite willing to prohibit their being done openly by his subjects. He could not, however, answer for what people did in their own houses, nor could he be responsible for the action of foreigners w T ho were not under his control. He then raised the question of the camels and other plunder, and said that if the Ikhwan were willing to withdraw, and leave everything they had taken behind them, he would not interfere with them. Ibn Sulaiman maintained that the Ikhwan had a right to keep what they had taken in battle, and said that he could not agree to leave it without reference to Dawish, but that he would refer the matter to him. He then withdrew, and went off towards Dawish's tent, which was on the far side of the village. Shortly after this the Ikhwan withdrew without further fighting, but taking everything with them. They marched for three hours that day, and ©n the 12th October moved on to Subaihiyah. The Kuwait casualties were comparatively small, and'amounted to about two hundred in all. The Ikhwan on the other hand, who attacked in the open with the most fanatical disregard for their own safety, lost enormously. It is estimated that their killed alone amounted to eight hundred, while they are said to have had more than that number severely wounded, of whom some four hundred died before they reached Subaihiyah, and more than a hundred after that. On the 14th October Faisal ad-Dawish sent a letter to Shaikh Salim from Subaihiyah, demanding that Hilal al-Mutairi, who is one of the biggc st mer chant in Kuwait, should be sent out to treat with him regarding a settleuient78 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE of the dispute. Shaikh Salim refused, and replied that if ^ Dawish wished to discuss anything with him, he should send in delegates of his own. On the 18th October a deputation from Paisal ad-Dawish arrivA in Kuwait, but from the first it was evident that their terms were impossible of acceptance, being in short, a demand that the whole of Kuwait should become Ik] l wan. Shaikh Salim himself put off seeing them nearly a week, and, in the meanwhile, officially asked for British assistance. On the morning of the 24 th October he dismissed the envoys, also refusing a demand for^ supplies which they put forward. The Political Agent was present at the beginning of the interview and delivered to them both in writing and verbally, a com munique, which had also been previously dropped by aeroplanes to the effect that so long as hostilities had been confined to the desert and Jahrah, the British Government had not been called upon to do more than use friendly efforts in the interests of peace. When, however, threats were being uttered against the town, British interests and the safety of British subjects, as well as our assurance to the Sheikh of Kuwait, become involved, and we could no longer remain spectators. From the assurances recently repeated by Ibn Sa'ud the British Government was sure that their hostile action was altogether contrary to his wishes and orders and that he would doubtless make this clear as soon as he heard of their action. In any case they were warned that if they should make -my attempt to attack Kuwait, they would be regarded as guilty of hostility to British authorities as well as to the Sheikh of Kuwait, and that we would have no alternative but to oppose such hostile action by every convenient means. Jufran al-Paqm , the head of the deputation, replied that the Ikhwan were acting under Ibn Sa'ud's direct orders in operating against Sheikh Salim. The Political Agent said that he could not believe this, as Ibn Sa'ud was a friend of the British, and had recently given us assurance that he would not molest Kuwait, and that he knew him to be a man of honour and one who would keep his word. He then repeated the warning that we would oppose them if they attacked Kuwait, and withdrew. The envoys left Kuwait and retuned to Subaihiyah the same day. On the 28th October a representative of Shaikh Salim's, who had accompanied the envoys to Subaihiyah, returned with letter from Faisal ad-Dawish to the effect that he had believed the promises which Shaikh Salim had made to Ibn Sula- iman at Jahrah and that, in consequence, he had abstained from hostile action . and had also tried to stop Ibn Sa'ud's forces- He now saw, however, that Shaikh Saiim had deceived him and was not fulfilling his promises and that the truce was consequently at an end. The man said that when he left the Ikhwan were loading up water, and intended leaving for Safah on the morning of the 26th, to await ammunition and supplies. This report proved to be true, at any rate so far as their moving to Safah was concerned. The sight of British aeroplanes and of His Majesty's Ships in Bay not unlikely influenced Dawish in his decision to withdraw. On the 30th October the Sheikh of Kuwait was informed that the High Commissioner considered it a matter of urgency to prevent further bloodshed during the period which must elapse before the question now at issue between him and Ibn Sa'ud could be amicably settled. It was accordingly intimated that the wells of Subaihiyah were not be occupied by either party, and either side which infringed this direction would render itself liable to hostile action bv aeroplanes. The same message was sent to Ibn Sa'ud via Bahrain. The High Commissioner also sent a message to Ibn Sa'ud via Bahrain to the effect that he was unable for a moment to believe that he had been privy to the Ikhwan attack on Jahrah, but that it showed the Ikhwan were out of hand. It was urgently necessary that amicable relations should be estab lished at once between him and Shaikh Salim. To this end he invited him to come to Basrah forthwith for the purpose of meeting him under our auspices. Ibn Sa'ud'a first reference to the battle of Jahrah was made in a letter dated 20th October, in which he said that, during his absence at 'Uqair, his force guarding the northern frontier had encountered the rabble collected by Sheikh Salim, and that both sides had suffered casualties. On the 26th he wrote again, forwarding a copy of report on the subject from Faisal ad-Dawish, topersian gulf political residency, 1920. 79 the effect that, after the return of Ibn Tawalah and Da ij from the south, Shakh Salim had sent out three raiding parties against Najd one of which had actually reached Bumah, one and a half days from Eiyadh, and captured a large number of camels. The Mutair under Faisal-ad-Dawish had hotly pursued the raiders as far as Jahrah where the fight had taken place. Although Shaikh Salim had had the advantage in numbers and position, they had been victorious and Shaikh Snlim had taken refuge in the fort and begged for peace. Dawish had replied that he would refer to Ibn Sa'ud, and had moved to Subaihiyah to await his orders Thev had lost a hundred killed and two hundred wounded. The Kuwait casualties were not known, but had been very heavy Ibn Sa ud had all along feared that the concentration of Ibn Tawalah s Shammar at &lt;1 ah rah under Shaikh Salim's war-Bag had meant trouble, and he had reported his fears. He had sent his cousin Abdul, Aziz at-Turki to keep his tribes in hand. Alth ough he attached little importance to the whole affair, he hastened to inform His Majesty's Government. It is strange, to sav the least of it, that Ibn Sa'ud had heard nothing of a raid bv Shaikh Salim's men one and a half day from Riyadh, until informed by Dawish from Subaihiyah. It is also strange that Jufran al-fabm, Dawish s envov in Kuwait, did not mention these raids to the Political Agent, Kuwait, but maintained instead that the Ikhwan were operating against Shaikh balim hv Ibn Sa'ud's direct orders. For the above two reasons, and also from tiie fact that his statement of the Ikhwan casualties at Jahrah is definitely known to he untrue, one is inclined to doubt that there is any truth at all in Dawish s story of these raids. 'Abdul 'Aziz at-Turki, mentioned in Ibn Sa'uJ's letter, or Abu Dha'ar as he is known in Kuwait, has been mentioned in reports received in Kuwait as bein- in Sudah, and trying to incite the Ajman and other tribes to make common cause with the Ikhwan against Kuwait, but the reliability of these reports is not above suspicion. Towards the end of November the village of Jahrah, which bad been abandoned since the battle, was reoccupied by Shaikh Salim, and the making of fortifications there was taken in hand. He was told that although there was of course, no objection to his reoccupying the village, the High Commissioner trusted that he would not again hoist his war flag or maintain an abnormal aarrison there, to which he replied that he had no intention at present of maintaining a large force there under his war-flag, hut merely a small garrison for the protection of the village itself. In a letter dated 12th November Ibn Sa'ud acknowledged the receipt of the Hiofi Commissioner's ruling regarding the non-occupation of Subaihiah bv either party. He said that he accepted this ruling and guaranteed that there would be no further attack on Kuwait, nor would Subailhiah or Jalirah be occupied by his troops, provided His Majesty's Government guaranteed that no hostile move or advance were made from Kuwait, and that no tribes hostile to him, like the Shammar, went to Shaikh Salim, and further that none of his disloyal tribes, like the Mutair, ,Ajman, etc., were seduced or sheltered bv Shaikh Salim. If, however. Shaikh Salim made any move from Kuwait or approached Jahrah or Subaihiyah, he would not hold himself responsible for the result. The abo^e letter was apparently delayed in transit and before it was received in Bahrain, Ibn Saud's reply to the High Commissioner's invitation to Basrah, dated 18th November, had arrived there. He refused to come to Basrah, as he had contracted a severe indisposition as a result of his visit to i XJqair; his presence in Najd was necessary at the time, as it was the season for the general tribal migrations which required special control ; and he had received a report (which proved to be baseless) that the Amir 'Abdullah was at • Hail. He offered to accept the High Commissioner's ruling regarding his dispute with Kuwait in his absence. In a private letter of the same date to the Political Agent, Bahrain, he asked him whether he did not agree that it would be greatly lowering to his dignity to go to Basrah.80 administration report of the In a letter dated 24th November he again complained that Shaikh Salim was continuing his intrigues amongst his tribes and said that he was deter mined to punish his disloyal tribes in the yicinity of Kuwait, unless fhey were sent away from there. He demanded that this should be done at an early date, otherwise he would despatch a punitive expedition. The tribes to which Ibn Sa'ud refers first started coming over to Shaikh Salim during the first half of August, when a section of the 'Ajman, and some of the Mutair who had not joined the Ikhwan sect came over and camped at Subaihiyah. In Kuwait their action was, of course, described as spontaneous, though it is quite probable that Shaikh Salim had offered them inducements. In the first half of November four more ' Ajman Sheikhs, including Naif bin Hithlain, Dhaidan's cousin, came over with their following, to the number of about a hundred tents, and bringing their camels and flocks. They said that they had come with Dhaidan's connivance, but, that at the request of 'Azman 'Aziz at-Turki who was camping with him, he had made a pretence of trying to stop them. According to reports received in Kuwait, Taisal ad-Da-wish visited Ibn Sa'ud at Eiyadh in the latter part of November, and returned to Artawitah his headquarters, early in December. On the morning of the 26th December a camp of 'Ajman and Hashaidah at Zaghlah, some fifteen miles north-west of Jahrah, was attacked by Faisal ad-Dawish and a force of Ikhwan, estimated at 200 horsemen and 400 camel riders, and all their camels and sheep were seized. According to the state ment of women refugees who have arrived, all men who fell into the Ikhwan's bands were killed, and some women outraged. Dawish's son 'Uzaiyiz was severly wounded and not expected to live. The Ikhwan said that they had received permission to visit Zubair for mmabalah and that they purposed making Safwan a base from which to raid. They left Zubair in the direction of Ghadhai, sixteen miles north-w r est of Jahrah, on the 28th December. A rms T raffic. The smuggling of arms and ammunition from Kuwait continues. By far the greatest number are smuggled across to the Persian coast in sailing craft. Another direction, though always in considerably smaller numbers, was chiefly overland to Qatar and Dubai, and thence .by sailing craft, chiefly to the Mekran coast. It is doubtful, however, if any have found their w^ay by this route since the troubles between Kuwait and Ibn Sa'ud became acute, as all land borne trade to the south has been at a stand still. A report was also received of arms and ammunition being sold to the tribes on the Euphrates from Kuwait. These were presumably conveyed by land. In August a boat containing arms and ammunition was detected being smuggled on board one of the B. I. S. N. Company's steamer. The owners, two Najdis bound for Bahrain, were arrested and imprisoned by the Sheikh, in addition to the arms being confiscated. P earl E isheries. The pearling season was bad so far as Kuwait was concerned, as owing to the strained relations with Ibn Sa'ud and the fear of actual war, the fleet w r as prohibited from going so far afield as usual, and had to confine its attentions to the inferior peari banks nearer home. The fleet, which was smaller than normal, did not leave until after Kamadhan, in the latter half of June, and remained out till the end of September. C ustoms A dministration. Khan Sahib 'Abdul Latif has continued to manage the Sheikh's Customs throughout the year. Owing to the quarrel with Ibn Sa'ud and the c nsequent stoppage of all trad a with Najd, the Customs receipts have shown a very marked decline throughout the year : —from Rs. 42,600 in Jamad al-Au-w r alpersian gulf political residency, 1920. 81 (22ad January—19th February) and Es, 50,200 in Jamad at-Thani C20tli lebruary—ISth March) they had fallen to lis. 6,350 in Dhil Qa'dah 17th July —15th August). Although he has been urged to do so, the Sheikh still refuses to abandon his present custom of levying customs dues on goods manifested for but not landed at Kuwait.

Persian Gulf throughout the year. Captain D, de M. 8. Praser, I.A., was Secretary from the commencement of the year till April Gth, when he was relieved by Mr. G. H. Gidney, I.C.S., and proceeded on leave to England. Mr. Gidney was transferred to Hyderabad on July 151h and handed over to Captain W. P. Q. Shuldham, I.A., pending the arrival of Major M. E. Rae, I.A., on the 15th August, who in his turn was relieved by Major G. P. W. Anson on October 12th and proceeded to Muscat as Political Agent. Lieutenant O. P. Curtoys, I.A., was Under Secretary till January 13th, when he was relieved by Captain W. P. Q. Shuldham, I.A., who held charge of this post for the remainder of the year. Mr. S. Clegg continued to act as temporary British Vice-Consul through out the year. Major A. S. M. Peebles was Residency Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. Maior W. L, Meade, I.A., His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, was relieved by Mr. H. G. Chick, C.I.E., on the 23rd March, and proceeded on leave to England. Mr. Chick held charge of the office till the end of the year. Monsieur U. Sudreau held charge of the Prench Consulate until the end of October when on proceeding to Baghdad Foreign Representatives. to act as Consul there, he handed over charge to Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.8.I., C.I.E. Mr. C. A. Gardner, Imperial Bank of Persia, held charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate until May 13th, when on proceeding on leave to England he banded over charge to Mr. A. A. Slesser, Imperial Bank of Persia. On the 26th August His Majesty's Consulate-General took over charge of the Norwe gian Vice-Consulate. The Russian, German and Turkish Consulates remained closed throughout the year. His Excellency Muwaqqar-ed-Dowleh though nominally Governor of the Gulf Ports never put in an appearance at Local Government. Bushire, and his brother Masud-us-Sultan continued to act as Governor until the middle of March, when on the former being appointed Minister for Public Works in Zia-ud-Din's cabinet he was confirmed in his appointment as Governor. He was, however, not to be allowed to remain long and at the beginning of August was informed that he was to be replaced by Mushar-ed-Dowleh, and shortly afterwards left for Tehran via Baghdad, handing over to Seyyid Hussein, Rais-i-Baladieh. His Excellency Mushar-ed-Dowleh arrived in Bushire on the 2nd October. He is a better educated and more civilised person than is customary to find in this appointment, having spent several years in Paris and visited England. Yamin-ul-Mamalik was Karguzar throughout the year. jr2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE Misrup Khan was in charge of the Finance Department throughout the year. Relations between the Eesidency and the Local Government have been most cordial during the period under report. His Excellency Musaddiq-us-Sultaneh held this position till March 22nd „ n , - „ when he was dismissed by Seyyid Zia-ud- Governor-General o£ Fars. , i • j i , , Dm, as he strongly objected to the latter's policy and made no attempt to conceal his opinions. He was succeeded by His Imperial Highness Nusrat-us-Sultaneh who was still in office at the close of the year. The latter is a man of weak character, and hardly suited to be the Admini strator of probably the most turbulent province in Persia, especially now that the support given to him by the presence of the South Persia Rifles has been withdrawn by their disbandment. He has, however, pro-British inclinations, and his relations with His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, have been most friendly. At the beginning of the year the Persian Gulf garrison, under the com- Persian Gulf OarrUon mand of Lieutenant-Colonel O. St. John, consisted of the 2-112th Infantry and two companies of the 117th Mahrattas at Muscat, the latter being relieved by the 2-35th Sikhs in February. The arrival of the newly raised force of Muscat levies at Muscat on the 19th April 1921 enabled the 2-35th Sikhs, who were finding the detachments at Muscat, Jask and Charbar to be withdrawn, the detachments at Jask and Charbar and the Agency Guard at Muscat being taken over by the 2-112th Infantry. At the beginning of the year Salar Nusrat was holding the appointment Bashire of Deputy Governor of Dashti and Dash- tistan, but he was soon recalled to Shiraz, and Asaf-ul-Mulk, a venal and rapacious official, was appointed to succeed him. At the same time the Governor-General, His Excellency Musaddiq-us- Sultaneh suddenly announced his intention of reinstating (1) Ghazanfar-us- Sultaneh at Borasjun, where Agha Khan Borasjuni had been installed by the Persian and British authorities when Ghazanfar fled before the approach of the British force in 1918, and (2) Nur Muhammad Khan, one of the most cruel men on the Bushire-Shiraz road, at Daliki in place of Kal Ismail, these two having been respectively dismissed and installed during the operations oi 1918-19. Agha Khan was very friendly disposed towards the British, and had preserved law and order in his district and security on the road ever since he had been appointed, whereas Ghazanfar, apart from the fact that he was the centre of the group of Khans who assumed hostile attitude to the Allies during the war, had an unenviable reputation for intrigue, cruelty and oppression of caravans. The return of Ghazanfar and Nur Muhammad was therefore strongly opposed by the Residency, but unfortunately orders were received from Tehran too late to prevent their departure from Shiraz. Moreover owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding a strong South Persia Rifle escort was first detailed to accompany Asaf-ul-Mulk, Ghazanfar and Nur Muhammad from Kazerun to Borasjun and later the Officer Commanding decided to accompany the party himself, in order to assist the Deputy Governor in reinstating the two Khans, as he expected opposition; in addition to this the party was already two marches out of Kazerun before the Tehran orders cancelling the arrange ments could reach them. It was decided therefore that in the circumstances it was too late to do anything without prejudicing the South Persia Rifles in the eyes of the local Khans, who had determined to resist the reinstatement of the two Khans until they saw that the South Persia Rifles meant business. Nur Muhammad Khan was therefore safely installed at Daliki and Ghazanfar at Borasjun, Agha Khan having proceeded to Bushire prior to Ghazanfar's arrival. Shortly afterwards Ghazanfar and Nur Muhammad came in to Bushire to talk matters over, and both were full of promises regarding their future good behaviour. In April Ghazanfar again came into Bushire, and every effort was made to arrive at a modus vivendi between him and Agha Khan. After twoPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. all intrigue against Ghazanfar. During this visit to Bushire Gbazanfar was profuse in promises of his future good behaviour and his readiness to respect authority and maintain good relations with the Residency, and so far he has kept his promises, but it remains to be seen what his attitude will be now that the South Persia Bifles have been disbanded, ]Nur Muhammad Ehan on the other hand at once settled down to his old games, and put Kal Ismail in chains and bastinadoed him so severely that some of his toes dropped off ; he also started to levy very heavy Eahdari on caravans. This however proved too much for the Persian authorities, and instructions were issued for his dismissal, which he refused to obey assuming a most truculent attitude and making preparations to resist any force sent to evict him. At the request of the local authorities a column of South Persia Rifles, under the command of Captain P. G. Villiers-Stuart, was therefore detailed to move on Daliki from Eazerun and remove Nur M uhammad The column left Kazerun on the 18th May and by 4-30 a. m . on the 2i8t had completely surrounded Daliki. A messenger was then sent to Nur Muhammad demanding his immediate submission, which he refused and the messeneer was tired at when returning from the village. A heavy fire was then directed on the South Persia Bifles from Daliki, and Captain Villiers-Stuart decided to attack at once, a very stiff resistance was put up by Nur Muhammad but it was ot no avail against the disciplined and spirited attack of the South Persia Rifles who stormed and captured the village by 9-30 a. m. Nur Muhammad was mortally wounded in the flght, and died shortly afterwards, and his brother Jlusam 13eg was killed. a i , K ? 1 J™ ail , was ^leased, and Agha Khan installed as Khan of Daliki bv Asar-ul-Mulk, the Deputy Governor of Dashtistan. ■.ooA Zair - Khi 'P lar who r e sum ed the office of Zabit of Tangistan at the end of owing to no other man being strong enough to hold it, has remained comparatively quiet throughout the year. On the urgent representations of His Excellency Masud-us-Sultaneh, and p. Ghazaufar and A ur Muhammad had been reinstated, Sbeikb Mohamed of Qhahkutah, son of the late Sheikh Hussein, was permitted to return to Abmedi and Chahkutah m February on condition that he handed over Ts. 1 000 to the Governor to be deposited in the Imperial Bank of Persia as securitv for his future good bedaviour The money was duly paid to the Governor, but it was subsequently discovered that His Excellency never paid it into the Bank and w f Bushire without having done so. In the circumstances the security was a farce and m point of fact Sheikh Mohamed has not behaved very well, having oppressed and harried his uncle Sheikh Abdullai who was installed as ^ban during the Bushire operations, and who was given the iljage of Abu Tawil on Sheikh Mahomed's return.

Prom the beginning of the year until November the South Persia Rifles, supplemented by the road guards, who Buehire-Shiraz Road. controlled an( J paid by the Corp8, were responsible for the security of the road with excellent results, it being as safe as in the previous year, and no robberies of any note occurred. On the withdrawal and disbandment of the South Persia Eifles at the beginning of November the road guards were retained by the Provincial Government, but they have not received their pay regularly, and no doubt will shortly become a greater danger to caravans and travellers than the robbers themselves, as they obviously must live somehow, and the simplest way of doing so is by oppressing and fleecing caravans. Already many small robberies have been reported, and heavy Rahdari is being levied especially on the lower portion of the road. The actual road is of course suffering considerably from the absence of repairs, and in many places is hardly passable by wheeled traffic. The violent fluctuations of politics in Tehran during the year did not to any great extent influence the situation Fars, Shiraz and the Tribes. ^ ag long ^ ^ p ersia Eifleg were in existence. The rise of Bolshevik influence in the capital accompanied as it was by a violent anti-British campaign in the press was always counteracted in Shiraz and Ears by the presence of the South Persia Riflesj a pro-British Governor-General, His Imperial Highness Nusrat-us-Sultaneh, and the friendly co-operation of His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk. On the disappearance of the South Persia Rifles, however, in November, many articles of a violently anti-British nature appeared in the press, and as was to be expected British influence has without doubt waned considerably. The relations between Qawam-ul-Mulk and Soulet-ed-Dowleh. the de facto Ilkbani of the Qashgais (his son Nasir Khan being titular Ilkhani), have been very strained, and almost reached breaking point when Soulet was passing Shiraz on his downward migration to the Garmsir in October. The Qawam at the time was in a very strong position, being strongly supported by the Governor-General, and he would probably have inflicted a severe defeat on Soulet had not the latter by skilful intrigue in the capital succeeded in persuad ing the Persian Government to issue orders to the Governor-General that equal treatment was to be meted out to the Qawam and Soulet, and the latter was allowed to proceed unmolested to his winter-quarters. Towards the end of the year a portion of the Darashuris under Ayaz Kikha, who had seceded to Bakhtiari country, returned to Kashgai territory, but they were not permitted to reside in their usual winter grazing grounds as these were too close to Bakhtiari. This has given Soulet a considerable accession of strength which however has been counter-balanced to some extent by the following of Ali Khan, Salar Hishmat. The deposit of Ts. 10,000 of Soulet in the Imperial Bank of Persia as a guarantee of his good conduct towards His Majesty's Government was returned to him on the 26th October under instructions from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. The Qawam-ul-Mulk has throughout the year been the outstanding personality in Ears, and has been very friendly disposed towards the British Authorities. The close of the year however saw his position somewhat weakened by the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles, the intrigues of Soulet in the Capital, and the revolt of Khanbaz Khan who has lately been reinforced by 300 tents of the Lalu Muhammadi and 200 tents of Lalu Ghani Arabs. In October Nasr Diwan, who fled from Kazerun on the approach of the Indian troops in the 1918-19 operations and took bast in the house of Qawam-ul-Mulk in Shiraz, applied to the Governor-General for permission to return to Kazerun as the period of his two years exile from Kazerun had expired. The Qawam pressed His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, to permit his returnPERSIAN GULF POLITIGAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 5 to Kazemn on the grounds that he himself was unable to prevent his return, and that it was preferable that the British authorities should acquiesce while they had the opportunity, as if they refused to agree Nasr Diwan would only force his way back as soon as the South Persian E-ifles were disbanded, and we should be powerless to prevent him. As this was undoubtedly true it was k! p considered expedient to acquiesce in Nasr Diwan's return, but before be left 0/| Shiraz he was made to sign an undertaking, which was deposited in the Consu- inni,. late, to behave correctly and in a friendly manner to British subjects and inter ests, and not to seek revenge on Persians who had rendered services to the Indian Troops and the South Persia Rifles. Qawam-ul-Mulk pledged himself in this document, to the British authorities as well as to the Persian Govern ment, that he would be ready to punish or expel Nasr Diwan from Kazerun should the latter break either of the above conditions. It remains to be seen whether Nasr Diwan, probably the most cruel scoundrel in Pars, intends to abide by this guarantee. It is sad to have to record that th© year under report saw the disappearance _ . of the South Persia Rifles, the most effi- South Persia limes. . . ji'ii j • • t jj? i-i cient and highly disciplinea rorco which has probably ever existed in Persian modern times or is likely to exist for some time. Owing to the necessity for reduction of commitments abroad His Majes ty's Government intimated early in the year their inability to continue to pay for the South Persia Rifles, and though at one time when Seyyid Zia-ud-I)in was in power it looked as if the Persian Government would take over at any rate a portion of the force, eventually, after much vacillation, the Persian Government refused to have anything to do with it. Consequently the South Persia Rifles had to be disbanded and this was concluded by November and the head-quarters office which had been transferred to Bushire from Shiraz in Nov ember closed down at the former place on the 12th December. The disbandment which was carried out gradually in batches one-third at a time was marked by no untoward incident, the men showing the utmost docility in handing in their arms and even in actually destroying rifles and ammunition, etc., and it is a remarkable fact that there w r ere only 20 desertions during this period, which is very good proof of the high state of discipline of the force and the staunch loyalty of the Persian Officers and men to Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. K. Eraser, D.S.O., M,C., Inspector-General, and the British Officers and Non-Commissioner Officers attached to the force. It did indeed seem hard that all the strenuous work which Colonel Eraser and his officers had put into the creation of this force, and which had achieved , such excellent results, should have come to nought. Nasrullah Khan and Muzaffar Khan Boir Ahmedi are now on excellent Behbehan terms with each other, and it has caused much surprise that the settlement conclud ed by them in March 1920 should have had such satisfactory results. Muzaffar Khan raided Lirawi in October and carried off some animals, but otherwise the district has been remarkably quiet. Towards the end of the year Kuhgelu was reported to be much disturbed 3 Sbukrullah Khan Boir Ahmedi having attacked Hussain Kuli Khan and occu pied the fort at Tambi. Hayat Daud has continued peaceful under the wise administration of Hai- Hayat Daud and Lirawi. dar Khan, C.I.E. Hi ere has been some difficulty in effecting a settlement of arrears of reve nue due by Agha Khan of Lirawi to Haji Saeed-us-Sultaneh, owing partly to the ravage of locusts and to a misunderstanding as to the amount due, and it was feared at one time that Lirawi might be sold to an outsider. The arrears have now been paid, and the danger of its being put up for sale has for the present been averted. It is worthly of note that suggestions that the Sheikh of Mohammerah or Qawam-ul-Mulk might be asked to purchase the fief were received with the utmost consternation by Agha Khan, and Haidar Khan, probably for the reason that being powerful magnates living comparatively near they would be in a position to demand higher rent and to enforce their demands if necessary.6 administration report of the Hussein Khan, Zabit of Dilum, having oppressed the people of Dihim for some time, a large number of influential inhabitants came in to see the Gover nor at Bushire early in the year and demanded his dismissal. They also wired their complaints to Tehran and in July the Persian Government ordered the Governor to dismiss him. Haidar Khan was however first given the opportu nity to remove him and put in someone else, but this he persistently refused to do, although thoroughly disapproving of him, and was rather obstinate about the matter. He apparently feared that some person might be appointed by the Governor of Bushire who would be antagonistic towards him and stir up trouble in his territory. The Persian Government was however very persistent and threatened to send the ' Persepolis ' and remove Hussein Khan by force, and eventually Haidar Khan consented to dismiss him on the advice of the Besid- ency. It was unfortunate that this should have been necessary but in view of the attitude of the Persian Government it seemed better for Hussein Khan to acquiesce in their orders than to put himself in the wrong by refusing to obey. It is certain that there was a good deal of intrigue in this matter and that the Governor received some gratification, but on the other hand there is no doubt that Hussein Khan was tyrannical, Haidar Khan having only a comparatively short time before informed the Residency that he was thinking of.removing him. Moreover independent enquiries made by representative of the Residency showed that there was considerable cause for complaint. On Hussein Khan's dismissal in August Haidar Khan appointed one of his own men as locum teneus, who was relieved later by Quli Khan. The politics in Tehran have had little effect on Bushire, though towards Bxishire the close of the year the anti-British, or perhaps more properly speaking anti- Eoreign, feeling has been more openly expressed. Bolshevik propaganda and influence have not as yet reverberated to Bushire. In December His Majesty's Minister, Sir Percy Loraine, Bart., C. M. G., paid a visit to Bushire en route to take up his duties in Tehran, being conveyed up the Gulf in H. M. S. ' Renown '. He landed at the New Customs, Bushire, on the 1st December, salutes of 17 guns being fired by the ' Perse- pplis ' and the shore battery. He was received by a guard of honour of Police and a representative of the Governor and of the Karguzar; the Resident and Officer Commanding Troops and several of the principal British residents wert also present, and proceeded to the Town Residency. Here the Minister re ceived a visit from His Excellency the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who was given his salute of 13 guns at the conclusion of the visit; the members of the British Chamber of Commerce were afterwards introduced. He then proceeded with the Political Resident to Sabzabad where he inspected the guard of-honour of the 2-112th Indian Infantry stationed at Bushire. That evening a dinner was given at Sabzabad in honour of Sir Percy Loraine at which His Excellency the Governor, the Karguzar and the leading members of the European community were present. The following morning, the 2nd December, the Minister returned the call of the Governor, and exchanged informal calls with the Karguzar, In the afternoon he embarked on H. M. S. 'Renown' and sailed at 4 a. m. on the morning of the 3rd December for the Shat-el-Arab bar where he transhipped to H. M. S. ' Crocus' in which he proceeded to Abadan and Mohammerah, the Resident having preceded him in the R. I, M. S. ' Law rence.' Trade has been very slack throughout the year, and the world trade depression has hit the European firms in Bushire very hard, and they have been compelled to write off very large sums as dead losses. German goods have made a reappearance in considerable quantities in South Persia, and Herr Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have established agencies in all the principal ports and are very busy endeavouring to secure orders. Their Agent in Bushire is Monsieur Konoff. The exploration of the Dasht-i-Qil area by the Anglo-Persian Oil ^ ^Company assumed very definite shape Oil Exploration at Dasht-i-Qil, j • xi J during the year.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. The Company's surveyors having decided that the best route to approach Dasht-i-Qil from the coast was from Genaweh near Bundar Eig, they set to woik to collect material and stores at Bushire and Grenaweh required for the construction of the road to the site of the first test boring so that they would be ready to start work as soon as agreements had been concluded with (1) Haidar Khan, C. I., E. or Hayat Daoud for the formation of the base at Genaweh and the construction of that portion of the road which lay in his territory and (2) the Kashkuli Khans in whose winter grazing grounds the prospective oil field is situated. Satisfactory agreements were concluded by Sir A. T. Wilson on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with the above parties on the 6th and 12th October respectively. The Kashkuli Khans however laid great stress on the fact that the Company should come to some agreement with Soulet-^d-Douleb, the de facto Ilkhani of the Kashgais, as they stated they were quite unable to defend the Company's interests from any hostile action on his part. By the end of the year the construction of the road was in full swing, some 1,000 Persian coolies being employed on the work, and a light portable drilling set had been landed at Genaweh and was being sent up in pieces to Dasht-i-Qil by manual labour. On hearing of the abovementioned agreements the Persian Government protested most strongly against their conclusion, and asserted that the Company had no right under their concession to make agreements of such a nature and that they should have applied to Government for permission to explore this area and for any guards which they might require to protect their employees, etc. They also alleged that the Kashkuiis and Haidar Khan had no right to the territories in question and finally declared the agreements null and void. The Persian Government however adopted the same attitude in regard to the Company's agreement with the Bakhtiari Khans. At the end of the year it remained to be seen whether they intended to maintain their attitude, or let the matter drop as on former occasions. The Company main- tains that as the Persian Government had hitherto never taken any steps to fulhl their obligation to protect the Company's employees and property, it was necessary to make agreements to protect themselves.

P. P. system, while the money order system is by no means efficient. The closure of the British offices before adequate guarantees are given for the efficient conduct by the Persian Post Office of these special services would undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on British Commercial interests especially in Arabistan where receipts from the V. P. P. and Money Order services are heavy owing to the presence of a large number of British and Indian employees of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. The type of Persian Postal Official at present employed in the South is certainly quite incapable of conducting these services satisfac torily. The whole matter is now under negotiation with the Persian Government and it is hoped that satisfactory guarantees will be forthcoming for the efficient conduct of these special services, before the British Post Offices are closed. The traffic in arms and ammunition from the Arabian to the Persian Coast of the Persian Gulf continued Arms Traffic. throughout the year, and at one period appeared to be slightly on the increase but it is extremely difficult to verify ports received, which often seem to be somewhat stimulated by the presence re of one of His Majesty's ships on a particular portion of the Coast. There is however one marked difference in the conditions of the Arms Traffic of the present time as compared with former years, namely that whereas in former years whole dhow-loads of arms and ammunition were shipped across in these days a dhow only carries a few rifles and small consignments of ammunition concealed in the general cargo. In August under instructions from the Secretary of State for India a Committee consisting of Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C. S. I., C. I. E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Captain J. L. Pearson, C. M. G., Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, Major W. G. Hutchinson, 0. B. E., Political Agent, Kalat, on behalf of the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan and Major J. C. More, U. S. 0., Political Agent, Kuwait on behalf of His Excellency the High Commissioner in Iraq assembled at Karachi to consider and recommend what measures should be taken to combat any recrudescence of the Arms Traffic. The Committee came to the conclusion that despite the fact that the figures relating to the Arms Traffic showed no immediate marked increase, traders were watching their opportunity and the large collection of arms now in Arabia was a source of future potential danger, and that this danger would undoubtedly materialise if the reports of activity of European dealers in ship ping arms and ammunition to the ports in the Red Sea were correct. The following measures were advocated by the Committee :— (a) The maintenance of the existing Naval forces in the Persian Gulf. (&amp;) The erection of a wireless installation at Kuwait for direct communi cation with His Majesty's Ships. (c) Pressure on Sheikhs and in the case of Kuwait an effort to persuade the Sheikh to establish registration of arms. During the year H. M. S. Visits of H. M. Ships. Manumission of slaves.

Bandar Ahhas. —Sartup Mirza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja Nizam, C.I.E., held the post of Deputy Governor until 13th [February, when he was replaced by Mirza Abdul Hussain Khan, the son of His Excellency Masud Sultan, then Governor of the Gulf Ports. Kalantar Abdul Hasul Khan, formerly Deputy Governor of Lingah, who was notorious for oppression and extortion, accompanied Mirza Abdul Hussain Khan in the capacity of Assistant. Mirza Abdul Hussain Khan arrived imbued with Bolshevistic and anti- British sentiments. Being moreover young and inexperienced and of an excitable and changeable disposition he soon fell foul of the leading merchants, who in March closed their shops and took ' Bast' in the Persian Telegraph Office in protest against his extortion and infringement of their fancied rights. The merchants sought His Majesty's Consul's mediation and after much discussion were persuaded to reopen their shops on the guarantee that Abdul Rasul Khan should be removed. On 7th April Haji Mohammed Hassan arrived from Bushire to settle the dispute, and on His Majesty's Consul's advice sent Abdul Basul Khan to Bushire the following day. Haji Mohammed Hassan remained in Bandar Abbas as Assistant to the Deputy Governor and from the time of his arrival harmony was more or less restored. Mirza Abdul Hussain Khan's attitude towards the Consulate improved considerably wdth time, and he show 7 ed commendable promptitude in the recovery of British subjects' claims. On receiving the news of his father's dismissal Mirza Abdul Hussain Khan left Bandar Abbas on 8th August and Haji Mohammed Hassan acted as Deputy Governor until 3rd December when he w r ent to Bushire, leaving Mirza Abbas Khan, the local linance Agent, to act for him. He returned on 19th December having been confirmed as Deputy Governor. Lingah. Mohammed Heza, Satwat-ul-Mamalek, remained in office as Deputy Governor throughout the year, in spite of frequent intrigues to obtain his dismissal. He visited Bastak and Bushire during May and June and left his younget brother Abdul Kassim Khan to act for liim on both occasions.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. lo His attitude has been consistently friendly and his influence in the Linterl and has kept the district uniformly quiet. He is somewhat too prone to listen to the advice of certain Bastak merchants to whom he is said to be in debt, and he is not so prompt as he might be in the recovery of British subjects' claims. The Shia party in Lingah are always hostile to him. Minab.—Mirza Mohammed Shafi w^as dismissed on 23rd February and on arrival in Bandar Abbas apologised in person to His Majesty's Consul for his behaviour in Minab in December 1920. He was replaced by Haji Khan, a weak character who had previously held the post and been found wanting. Owing largely to his incapacity. 15 the condition of Mmab became so bad that on SiJth August Abbas Khan '■ brother-in-Jaw of Mir Barakat, was appointed to succeed him. His attitude . it li* towards the British was friendly and the British subjects in Minab wrote to 9 «'0ii express their satisfaction at his appointment. In October he allowed Mir » «£ Barakat to visit Mmab, and the entertainment of the latter and his followers during the six weeks of their stay was a heavy tax upon the inhabitants. ,, , On 21st November Zair Abdullah Khan arrived in Minab to replace Abbas Khan, and Mmab was made directly subordinate to Bushire once more instead of being under Bandar Abbas as in the past few years. Zair Abdullah Khan is an avowed friend of the British but he appears rather too elderlv neitta, to &lt;ieal effectively with the turbulent elements in the district. K arguzar.

Mir Barakat of Biyaban and Zargham-us-Sultaneh of Budbar have been engaged in a species of tribal warfare during the summer and autumn months, the casus belli being the protection afforded by the former to some Bashakirdis robbers, who fled from Budbar. The quarrel led to increased depredations by Biyabanis and culminated in the visit of Mir Barakat to Minab, on the pretext of protecting the district from Zargham, but with the real object of feeding bis forces at the expense of Minab. Perhaps the worst effect of this visit was the stopping of the caravans from Budbar, on which the trade of Minab mainly depends. Condition of Boads.

Convoy was attacked by Mazidi Arabs one mile south of the Tang-i-Lambi. 20 camels were carried off, but in the running fight which ensued, they were all recoTered with their loads and 2 robbers were killed on the road, while 3 more were reported to be wounded. In September a caravan of Afghans with goods belonging to British Indian merchants, was reported to have been looted near Tang-i-Nivargu by robbers said to have come from the Bashakard district. Lingah. —No robberies have been reported. About 6,280 donkeys and 1,450 camels left for Lar with piece-goods, sugar and kerosine oil. Carpets and assafoetida were imported from Lar. Arms Traffic. Bandar Abbas. —In January an armed party from Kauristan said to be carrying 50 rifles and 30,000 rounds of ammunition passed through the district en route to Biyaban. At His Majesty's Consul's request the Deputy Governor sent out a party to intercept them. Shots were exchanged and a guide accompanying the Governor's party was brought back wounded and died in Bandar Abbas. No captures were made. Two Government rifles and about 200 rounds S. A. S. were recovered through the South Persia Bifles and the Deputy Governor during the year. In Persian territory Lar appears to be the main distributing centre for arms, which are said to be imported from Koweit and the Trueial Coast. Shipwrecks. A dhow belonging to a Bahrain subject was wrecked off Qishm in May. The Sheikh of Qishm apparently with the connivance of the Customs Mudir demanded half the value for salving the cargo. The Sheikh was subsequently fined Tomans 400 and the Mudir Tomans 300 by the Director of Customs. Bandar Abbas—Kermn Telegraph Line. As the result of a quarrel between the Telegraph Ghulams and the Katkhuda of Kushku the Kushku office was wrecked and some instruments damaged in August. The Ghulams were transferred, and the,, Katkhuda dismissed and the Deputy Governor has promised to recover the cost of the damage, when a claim in detail is submitted. In October 45 insulators were broken and lines cut in two places near Ziyarat.16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE A viation. No aeroplanes visited Fandar Abbas during the year but Plight Lieute nant Hardman made a short stay in August to check stores and test the wireless installation. Visits op His Majesty's Eepresentatives. Bandar Ahhas. —The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.LE., visited Bandar Abbas in li. I. M. S. ' Lawrence' on 5th April, 2Btli September and 16th December. His Excellency Sir Percy Loraine, Bt., C.M.G., visited Bandar Abbas in H. M. S. ' Renown ' on 29th November, on his way to assume charge of His Majesty's Legation in Tehran. His Excellency received the Deputy Governor and Persian Officials on board, visited the Military Cantonment at Naiband and the town of Bandar Abbas, and received representative Persian and British merchants at.the Consulate. His Excellency and Captain the Hon'ble H. Mead, Commanding H. M. S. 'Kenown' dined at the Consulate and left for Bushire on the morning of the 30th November. Almost ihe entire population of Bandar Abbas availed themselves of the opportunity accorded them to visit H. M. S. 'Renown' and appeared to be greatly impressed with what they saw. British Indian Troops. One company of the 2-112th Infantry has been stationed at Bandar Abbas throughout the year, and has supplied detachments for garrison duty at Charbar and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company works on Qishm Island. The health of the troops has been uniformly good. Captain J. J. O'Brien was in command until 18th October when he was invalided to India, being relieved by Captain N. V. Hart. Political Prisoners. Batches of prisoners were released during January and Eebruary. The final batch who were relieved under the terms of the general political amnesty left Hen jam in June. The bungalow built to accommodate the Officer Commanding the prisoners guard has been handed to the Senior Naval Officer for use as a Naval Canteen, and the military guard on Henjam has been reduced to 18 men under command of a Havildar. Trade and Commerce. Bandar Ahhas. —The past year has been marked by a period of trade depression following on the financial crisis of December 1920. Goods ordered by the merchants in advance, when the rates of exchange were favourable, were received and had to be paid for in foreign currency, when the rates had risen against them. At the beginning of the year the rates were n »t very unfavourable, but as the year advanced, the rates rose, and on several occasions, notably in the summer, the Imperial Bank was not a seller of foreign exchange. Moreover, encouraged by the favourable rates formerly prevailing the merchants bad ordered large consignments of goods and the arrival of large stocks coinciding with a decrease in demand, the market became heavily overstocked. Bankruptcies have been frequent and credit unobtainable. In % autumn a further complication arose. The coinage had become very debased, as the Bandar Abbas branch of the Imperial Bank was the only branch which accepted light weight or worn coins, and consequently all the bad coins had found their way to Bandar Abbas. 'J he Bank therefore refusedPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 17 to accept such coins and the Customs followed suit. The merchants com plained that they were unable in consequence to take delivery of their goods from the Customs, hut in certain cases the excuse seems to have been seized to free them from obligations they were unable to meet. Good krans were exported by certain merchants to Bushire and Mohammerah for purposes of exchange trade, and the same persons were prominent in the complaint that they could not release their goods from the Customs, as the coins in their possession were not accepted. Statistics are not available to illustrate the progress of trade during the year, as the Persian year closes on the 20th March. It is probable that the returns will be misleading as the total value of imports will depend to a large extent on consignments delivered on forward orders and may give an impression of prosperity from the very cause which has most led to embarrassment. The subsidiary mail service has been maintained weekly throughout the year, but the service from Basra was very irregular, especially in the ^summer, and on one occasion nearly two months elapsed without a mail steamer arriving from Basra. Steamers of other lines visited the port on 41 occasions. Xiwp-aA.—Trade has been bad throughout the year, though it has not been affected to the same extent as that of Bandar Abbas, mainly because it is carried on a smaller scale. The most serious feature in the commercial situation was the slump in the pearl trade in which nearly all the local merchants are interested. As in Bandar Abbas, money was very tight throughout the year. The subsidiary mail service, weekly from India and fortnightly from Basra was maintained, but was very irregular in the first half of the year. Twelve steamers of other lines have called at the port during the year. W eather. Bandar Abbas and Zingah.~The year has been unprecedentedly dry and the harvests a complete failure. In Lingah there was a drought and by the autumn the water supply had been exhausted, only green and brackish water being available from the neighbourhood of Kung. Very heavy rain fell in November which has removed the water difficulty in Lingah and augurs well for the coming harvests in both districts. The heat in July and early August was very intense and was aggravated by the failure of the expected ' Shumal' wind. The town of Bandar Abbas was practically deserted by the end of July. JUinab. This district, as usual, enjoyed more rain and crons were moderately good. r Anglo-Persiak Agreement and Political Situation. Bander ^bbas. The repudiation of the Agreement, the situation in the North of Persia, Kemalist and Bolshevik propaganda, and reports received of the course of events in Ireland and India have all contributed to create an atmosphere of hostility to the British more intense perhaps than in anv previous year. ^ The disbandment of the South Persia Eifles appeared to confirm the rumours of the decline of British power, which have been widely published especially in the Shiraz press. Hostile elements have been emboldened bv these considerations, but the saner elements seem to be beginning to realise that British withdrawal means the removal of a benefit and not of a menace The feeling of the one party that they have less to fear, and of the other prestige^ 6 t0 ^ fr01n ^ react alike unfavourably upon our &gt; Lingah.—'The influences operative in Bandar Abbas are also at work m Lingah and are producing a similar result.18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE Tho Sunni party there have shown a ^reat interest in the fortunes of the Keinalist cause, and have hold several meetings with the ostensible object, of raising subscriptions for the support of that movement. Two or three Turks, said to have been prisoners of war in Inrlia, have been entertained by Salim Khaja, who was Turkish Vice-Consul at Lingah at the outbreak of war. Mujliss Election. Mirza 'Mahomed Bagher Dast Ghaib was returned as the member for Bander Abbas and district. The result of tho election was not announced until Mirza Abdul Hussain Khan became Deputy Governor, and Mirza Mahomed Shaft had been dismissed from Minab and had returned to Bandar Abbas. There is very little doubt that the ballot boxes were tampered with, and that the result did not reflect the will of the majority of the electors. South Persia Rifles. Captain Brannon was in command until August when he was relieved by Captain Toyne. The disbandment of the local detachment was completed on 30th September, the personnel of road posts and tufangchis having been previously called in and dismissed, and the local head-quarters were closed down and saleable effects disposed of shortly afterwards. The disbandment, including that of an armed party who had marched down from Kerman, was effected without any untoward incident. With the disappearance of the South Persia Rifles the protection of the district and the roads depends upon the Deputy Governor's force of about 30 tufangchis and upon such armed men as local Katkhudas can muster. A section of the Bandar Abbas inhabitants expressed their gratification at the news of the impending disbandment, and the event was celebrated by a dinner given by Sadid-us-Sultaneh. at which the Deputy Governor (Mirza Abdul Hussain Khan) and most of the officials were present and at which anti-British speeches were made. Slave Traffic. Bandar Eleven slaves came to the Consulate and one received a Manumission Certificate during the year, the remainder going to Sharjah or disappearing before their cases were settled. Zingah. —One slave applied for manumission, but the case is not yet settled. British Interests. Anglo' Tertian Oil Company tcells at Sallak. —Mr. H. TT. Hole continued to act as Manager on Qishm Island throughout the year. The depth reached at the end of the year was 3,056 feat. At 3,040 feet a slight shew oil was struck, which may indicate a main shew at a greater depth. In attempting to widen the hole a series of accidents occurred, which at one time seemed likely to necessitate the abandonment of the well, but there now appears to be some prospect of overcoming the obstacles which are impeding progress. The well is still in what at Maidan-i-Naphti is the petroliferous •eries, and this fact in conjunction with the discovery of shew oil gives ground for anticipating that the Island will prove a producing field. Changes in the drilling staff have again been frequent owing to illness, and at the^ end of the vear the complement was one driller only. Other causes which have retarded progress, have been shortage of fuel, breakages of tools, and the distance from the base of supplies.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 19 The total time lost in the year owing to sickness of staff and accidents in the well amounted to six months. The Company are now quarrying salt through a contractor, and are shipping it at the rate of 300 tons per mensem. In November a survey of the island and adjacent mainland was carried out by the Company's Geologists, but the report has not yet been completed. Imperial Bank op Persia. During the first half of the year business was fairly brisk, as money was circulating freely in the district, and the Bank were able to purchase Foreign Exchange from the South Persia Rifles and sell it to the merchants. The merchants had been making considerable profits during the three preceding years, and at the beginning of 1921 were still importing on a fairly large scale. Foreign Exchange at that time still favouring the importer. The dissolution of the South Persia Eifles, who were the chief sellers of Foreign Exchange, forced up the price of Foreign Exchange, which then became practically unobtainable. As they were the largest employers of labour and paid high wages, their departure impoverished those who had previously been able to buy imported goods, and this circumstance reacted on the merchants. Those merchants (the majority) who had imported goods on credit, found that they had to pay high prices for the Foreign Exchange, which they were obliged to purchase in order to pay for their goods, and at the same time they were unable to dispose their stocks owing to the decrease in demand. The result of this position was a number of bankruptcies and general loss of credit. The future prospects of Bander Abbas trade are not very bright. The Bank transferred their office in March to new premises specially built for them and leased to them by Ibrahim Giladari, and in October the Manager gave up his old residence and took over another house in the same neighbour hood outside the town. Mr. D. Sandes was Manager until 21st March when he was relieved by Mr. H. D. Couser, who was succeeded on 21st December by Mr. A. B. Hutchison. Q uarantine and M edical. Assistant Surgeon D. L. Mackay was in charge throughout the year. CharitaUe Dispensary Attendance. —The attendance of patients continued to be good. 4,215 out-patients were treated during the year as compared with 3,673 in 1919 and 4,279 in 1920. The attendance fell off very considerably during the third quarter of the year owing to the unusually large migration of the inhabitants caused by the intense depressing heat in July, August and the first part of September. Patients continue to be brought in from outlying villages and from Qishm Island, while travellers from the interior attend in fairly large numbers on the completion of the caravan journey. F rev ailing Diseases. —The following table shows the prevailing diseases for the years 1920 and 1921:— 1920. 1921. Diseases of the Digestive System .... 482 615 Diseases of the Eye ...... 521 627 Malaria . . . . . . . .618 794 Dysentery . . . . . . . 117 84 It will be seen that there is a considerable increase under each category except under that of Dysentery, which shows a decrease. Deaths. —Five deaths occurred amongst the out-patients as compared with 2 in the previous year, 3 of these being due to pneumonia, 1 to an abdominal gun-shot wound, and 1 to opium poisoning.20 ADMINISTRATION REPOllT OF THE Epidemics. —No epidemic diseases broke out in the town or district during the year. Cholera was reported at Muskat and ports on the Arabian coast, but it did not spread to Bandar Abbas. All precautions were taken with regard to the inspection of crews and passengers arriving from the Arabian coast. Vaccinations, —Vaccinations were carried out, but in spite of notices posted in the town the inhabitants did not avail themselves of the opportunity in large numbers. 158 persons, a large proporiion of whom came from the surrounding villages, submitted to vaccination with very good results. Medico-Legal Cases. —Nil. Post Mori ems. —Nil. Cases of TPoisoninq. —One case of opium poisoning was treated at the dispensary, which resulted in death. The victim was a young male child who had taken a crude dose of opium left in its way through the parents' careless ness. Ihe child was brought to the dispensary 12 hours after the dose was taken and died 3 hours later in spite of every effort being made to save him. Operations. —The number of operations performed in 1921 was 182 as compared with 131 in 1919 and 92 in 1920. Dispensary Building.~T\\z building is in a good state of repair, and the furniture, equipment and fittings are still in a serviceable condition. No sum was expended on repairs during the year. Sanitation of the Town.—The sanitation may be said to be bad. The Municipality works to keep the bazaars and surroundings of the houses clean^ but sites rapidly become soiled again. Half-demolished houses exist all over the town and are freely utilized as latrines. There are rubbish-pits in the interior of many houses, which furnish breeding grounds for flies, which abound everywhere. The inhabitants are incorrigibly careless in these matters, and warnings as to the danger of such carelessness fall on deaf ears. Water is stored in every house in cement cisterns or open earthenware pots, and the water is seldom or never changed. Mosquitoes consequently breed in great numbers and to this fact must be attributed the prevalence of malarial fevers^ which form a high percentage of the diseases treated at the dispensary^ A.—Assistant Surgeon C. W. Dunlop was in charge until the 25th June, when he was relieved by Assistant Surgeon S. Gr. Jackson, who remained in charge up to the end of the year. a case of cholera was landed from S. S. &lt;t Bankura , ' in September, and was removed by his relations from the Quarantine Station. This action,caused a cholera scare, but fortunately the disease did not spread. Economic Conditions. The bad harvest of 1920-21, the restrictions of grain exports from India and the higher Customs Tariff prevailing have contributed to keep the cost of living very high both in Bander Abbas and Lingah. The only commodity whose price has fallen very appreciably, is sugar, and this fall is due to the over-stocking of the market. The shortage of water caused by the lack of rain has occasioned great distress, especially in Lingah, during the summer. In Bandar Abbas the depression in trade has affected all classes, and this combined with the reduction and disbandment of the South Persian Rifles has left many of the lower class without employment. A comparative table showing the average prices obtaining in Bandar Abbas and Lingah for the last three years is appended. A. W.

Erom this date a change in the Governor-General 8 demeanour became noticeable. He bad undoubtedly resented all along the strong influence wielded by the pro-British party headed by Sardar ^usret and the influential priest Haji Mirza Ah Mohamed and their power to hinder his pec ^tbns and general spoliation of the province but, owing to the presence of the South Persia Rifles and the weakness of the anti-Bntish party which had been severely dealt with by General Sykes, he was torced to accept tbinga as they were and adopt an outwardly friendly attitude, towards the Anglophile nartv Amir Jang encouraged him in this attitude, being shrewd enough see that it was better to forego some of the profits which ^ derived but for the obstacles raised in their own interests by the pro-Bntis notables than to risk getting into our bad books by intriguing against these notables and encouraging the so-called Democrats and other disreputable elements who formed the Anglophobe party. ^ , , rm,,. dpnarture of Amir Jang in March which coincided with the first rumours of the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles, and the arrival of the new Bais Okaf, Mirza Reza Kban Eahimi, an official of strong anti-British yiews who soon became the confidant and adviser of the Governor-General, caused a complete change in the latter's attitude who thenceforward, until the close of the year, neglected no opportunity of inuring and discrediting those of British sympathies. , tt •• ht- at His hostility was chiefly directed against Sardar Nusret and Ha]i Mirza Ah Mohamed the former of whom be harassed to such an extent that he preferred to leave the province and proceed on a pilgrimage to Kerbela rather than contmue to sub iect himself to the loss of dignity and prestige entailed by the constant nin pricks and insults of the Governor-General. The latter was gradually deprived of all the Okaf properties of which he and his family had been in charge for many years, no opportunity being given him, despite his protests, to establish his right to these properties in the ordinary courts of law. The Governor-General on more than one occasion publicly insulted the Superinten dent of Persian Telegraphs, a notoriously pro-British official and brought pressu to bear in Tehran to secure his removal from Kerman. ^ His Majesty's Consul several times frankly discussed the situation with the Governor-General and urged him to adopt a more considerate attitude wards our friends. Such discussion however had no apparent ettect.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 23 Prince Mufakhar-us-Saltaneh discharged the duties of Deputy Governor throughout the year. The Governor- Deputy Governor. General delegated little authority to him and all nffairs of importance were dealt with by the Governor-General himself. The hostility shewn to Sardar Nusret by the Governor-General has been noticed above. The loss of prestige and influence suffered by Sardar Nusret _ as a result of this attitude on the part of Sardar Nnsret and Military Department. ^ Governor . General s0 mor ti fi ed him that he decided to leave the province and remain away until a change took place in the Governor-Generalship. Towards the end of November he left on a pilgrimage to Kerbela accompanied by his uncle, Amir Shaukat, and Sardar Mujallal. Sardar Nusret has always maintained most cordial and friendly relations with the Consulate and in his position as leading notabJe in the Province has exercised great influence over the attitude of lesser notables and the people generally towards the British. It is therefore a matter of regret that the Governor-General should have undermined his influence and authority and succeeded in forcing him to leave the Province. Adl-us-Sultan, a brother of Sardar Nusret, was dismissed from his post of Deputy Governor, Mehni, Sardui, Isfandiqeh and Jabal Bariz in August and died the following month. The command of the Provincial army was held by Sardar Nusret until July after w r hich he held no official appointment. In July the army was abolished, only 50 infantry for guards, the artillery and the band being retained. The command of this small force was held by a junior officer of the former Qushun Department. The permanent Karguzar, Mujallal-es-Sultaneh, was absent in Tehran until November and his assistant Mirza Habibullah Khan held charge of the department daring his absence. Habi bullah Khan though fairly satisfactory did not shew excessive zeal in settling claims presented through the Consulate. He is rather weak in character and has himself private business interests in the town which make him loath to take energetic action against debtors with whom he has private dealings. On the return of Mujallal-es-Sultaneh the value of British Indian claims pending in the Karguzari was Krans 456, 738. Mujallal-es-Sultaneh was towards the end of the year doing his best to settle these claims but complained of the opposition and interference of the Governor-General with whom he is on bad terms. The total number of cases settled by the Karguzari under Consulate supervision, including cases in which the interests of foreign subjects or firms were concerned, was 44 and compensation recovered amounted to Krans 43,942-05. Fifty six cases were pending at the end of the year. Amir Shaukat, uncle of Sardar Nusret, continued in charge of this depart ment throughout the year. The department was abolished by Sayid Zia -ud -Din i* 1 May who proposed that the South Qarasuran Department (Koad Gnards). ^ . V, . n i i i i , tJUULJl rersia limes should be responsible for the safety of the main routes in the province but in July, shortly after his fall, the department was re-established with a slightly reduced budget of Tumans 4,358 per mensem against tbe former figure of Tumans 5,358. The department has continued to be as corruptly administered as in former year and has yielded a handsome income to the Governor-General and Amir Shaukat. The custom of levying rahdari which was abolished in 1920 was reintro duced in a modified form during the year under report. Owing to the insecurity consequent on the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles the Governor-General in October applied for budget provision for an additional force of 100 sowars for the Yezd road. The proposal was sanc tioned but only 40 sowars were actually posted on the road, and the Governor- General transferred the charge of the road guards on this road from Amir Shaukat to the Bakhtiari Deputy Governor of Rafsinjan.24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE The charge of this department was held by Haji Izzul-Mamalik until his- dismissal in July. The Assistant Finan- Finance and Eevcnue Department. cial Agentj gheikh-lll-Mlllk and the Head Accountant then remained jointly in charge until the arrival of the new Financial Agent Muhandis-ul-Mamalik in September. In December Muhandis-ul-Mamalik received orders of dismissal and hardjd over charge of the department to 8heikh-ul-Mulk pending the arrival of the new incumbent, Patin-ul-Mulk who had not reached Kerman at the end of the year. Thanks to the abolition of the army which resulted in a saving of about Tumans 8,000 per mensem and to the fact that the land revenue was collected practically in full, the pro\incial revenues were sufficient to pay all demands made upon them by the various departments. No surplus however remained over for remission to the Capital. No reforms were introduced into the department during the year and no attempt was made to reduce the large sums which find their way into the jockets of the Governor-General and other officials. The holding of a large portion of the Eevenue grain in the Kerman ambars of the revenue department until the summer crop had been harvested' had the desired effect of preventing landowners from artificially raising the price of grain and the price of bread in the town at no time exceeded Krans 2-20 per man. The charge of this department was held by Rafi-ul-Vizareh until August when he proceeded nominally on four Opium and Tobacco Pepftrtmentfl. months'leave to Tehran. Thereafter the department was administered by the two senior members of its staff until October when Muhtesbam-ul-Mamalik (son of Amir Shaukat) was appointed acting llais Tahdid. The latter continued in charge until the end of the year. In January the opium tax was reduced from 21 to 6 shahis per miscal which resulted in some increase in revenue due to the reduced incentive to smuggling. The department was conducted in the usual corrupt and slip-shod manner. Mirza Keza Khan Fahimi held charge of this department from March until the close of the year. , , The strongly anti-British views of this Department of Kdacation and Eeligioui Beqaoeti. and olose friendship with and influence over the Governor-General has already been noticed above. The charge of this department was held by Mirza Abdul Rahim Khan throughout the year. Justice In March the department was closed under orders from Sayid Zia-ud-Din who announced that it would be completely reformed and reopened later. In May the Eais Adlieh was directed to submit the names of ten indivi duals whom he considered suitable for employment in the reformed Adlieh which he did. In August however, shortly after the fall of Zia-ud-Din, the department was reopened in its old corrupt form, the original staff being retained. During the time that the Adlieh remained closed the Governor-General arranged for the disposal of Adlieh cases by a commission appointed by himself. This commission proved to be more corrupt than the original Adlieh and in response to representations made to the Capital from Kerman, the Governor- General was on more than one occasion ordered to abolish it. He however failed to give effect to these orders and the Commission continued in existence up to the time of the reopening of the Adlieh. Owing to the encouragement given them by the Governor-General the Democrats. democrat party was more than usually active during the year under review. Immediately the Mejliss was opened in June they commenced bombarding the Capital with telegrams complaining of the illegality of the elections carriedam I 'iikl PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 25 out in 1919. These complaints however produced no result and the elections of all the deputies from the Province were confirmed in July. Efforts were made by the Democrat party in October to ensure the election of their candidate, Mirza Shahab, as representative for Sirjan and district in place of Mushar-ul-Mulk resigned. The Moderate party failed to agree on a candidate of their own for this by-election. The result of this by-election had not been announced up to the close of the year. In October the Governor-General granted permission to a certain Amin- ul-Islam, a noted extremist and trouble-maker, to edit a weekly newspaper. The Governor-General assured His Majesty's Consul that the paper would be^ carefully supervised and would not be permitted to publish anything objectionable. Notwithstanding these assurances almost every issue of the pnper has contained some objectionable reference to the British and pro-British notables have been singled out for abuse. Districts. The Governor-General did not attempt to upset the understanding that exists between him and His Majesty's Consulate to the effect that no change should be made without His Majesty's Consul's concurrence in the Deputy Governorships of Aqta Afshar, Sirjan, and Bam and Narma&amp;hir. Mirat-us Saltaneh, son of Sardar Nusret, held the post of Deputy Governor Aqta Afshar. ' district though he was absent in . t Tehran from Pebruary to October, Itizad- us-bultan acting for him during his absence. In ihe middle of November Mirat-us-Saltaneh took up his residence in Kerman to look after his father's affairs during his absence at Kerbela. Mirat-us-Saltaneh's administration was satisfactory and he maintained good order in his district which is a most important one as through it runs the mam caravan route to Bandar Abbas and it contains the summer and winter quarters of the powerful Afshar tribe. Salar Ashayir continued as Ilkhani of the Afshar tribe throughout the year. In August there was some friction between him and Mirat-us-Saltaneh's representative and the latter came in to Kerman to complain of the Ilkhani's insubordinate attitude towards him. The visit was not fruitful of results and Salar Ashayir's demeanour towards the Deputy Governor continued unsatis factory doubtless owing to the disfavour with which he knew Sardar Nusret's family was regarded by the Governor-General. Sardar Mujallal, the most enlightened and intelligent of the Deputy Gover- Bam and Narmashir. n0rS ^ ie Province Continued to admin is- ter this district throughout the year, b^rdar Mujallal is the son-in-law of Sardar Nusret and a staunch friend of the British. Owmg to the withdrawal of the troops from Eastern Persia and the dis- bandment of the Levy Corps in Sarhad and Eastern Baluchistan there was some increase of Baluch lawlessness in the Narmashir district. The Governor General refused to place any force at the disposal of Sardar Muiallal for the maintenance of order in the district. Sardar Mujallal wields considerable influence with the Baluch chiefs and great credit is due to him for the general good order he maintained solely by ins own resources. J J The Governor-General shewed a somewhat unfriendly attitude towards him towards the close of the year and Sardar Mujallal submitted his resigna- ! however was refused by the Governor-General at the request of His Majesty s Consul. At the end of November he accompanied Sardar JSusret 911 a pilgrimage to Kerbela, leaving his son-in-law, Salar Assad in charge of the Bam and Narmashir district. This district has continued under the semi-independent rule of Zargham- Rndbar. us-Saltaneh who only pays about half the ^ • j . „ revenue assessed upon the district and retains the remainder nominally as pay for himself as Deputy Governor, for pay26 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE \ I of revenue collector, upkeep of road guards, etc. He never visits Kerman and only carries out such orders of the Governor-General as happen to suit his convenience. Notwithstanding this unsatisfactory attitude towards the authority of the Persian Government, the Zargham is a capable ruler, maintains good order and prevents robberies. Mirza Mahmud Khan, Tabatabai, held the Deputy Governorship through out the year and maintained good order Sir;ian ' in his charge. His attitude towards the South Persia Rifles till its disbandment, was most helpful and friendly. The Buchaqchi tribe was quiet through out the year under the chief ship of Murad Khan, Sukuh-us-Sultan, cousin of Hussein Khan. At the close of the year Murad Khan left the tribe and proceeded to Bandar Abbas owing to oppression suffered by him at the hands of the Governor-General's mamurs. Hussein Khan arrived in Kerman in the month of August. He has abi ded by the conditions under which he was permitted to return i. e. that he should reside in Kerman town and have no relations with his tribe. His sympathies are with the Democrats and he has several times attempted both directly and through the Governor-General, who favours him, to obtain per mission from the Persian Government to return to his home and tribe but without success. No steps were taken during the year to re-establish the authority of the Persian Government in this district and it Persian Baluchistan. has continued as before under the independ ent rule of its various chiefs. The most influential of these, Mir Bahram Khan, of Bam pur, died in August and was succeeded by his nephew, Mir Dost Mohamed Khan. Mir Madad Khan, formerly Hakim of Jalk, who was expelled from his lands in the end of 1920 by Mir Dost Mohamed of Dizzak arrived in Kerman in October to try and get 'some allowance from the Persian authorities. He however died in Kerman of pneumonia shortly after his arrival. With the exception of the small Baluch raids into Narmashir already mentioned the Province did not suffer from Baluch incursions during the year under review. The remaining district Governorships were held as follows :— Rafsinjan , . . . . . Zargham-us-Sultan. Khabis ....... Mukhtar-ul-Mulk, head of the Khanzada family. Rawar, Zerind and Kub Bannan . . . Nusret-ul-Maraalik. Jiruft . . . • . • • • Muhtpsham-ul-Mulk. Jabal Bariz, Mehni, Sardui, and Isfandeqeh . Adl-us-Sultan (brother of Sardar Nusret), and after his death, Muhtesham-ud-Dau- leh and Muhtesham-ul- Mnlk. Bardsir Asaf-ul-Muik. Condition op Roads. The main routes in the Province are :— (1) Bandar Abbas to Kerman via Gakum and Saidabad. (2) „ „ „ „ „ Daulatabed and Baft. (3) „ „ ,, „ „ Rudbar and Jiruft. (4) Kerman to Yezd via Bahramabad. (5) „ „ Meshed via Rawar and Naiband. (6) „ „ Bam.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 27 1. JBaudar Abhas- Gakum-Saidahad-Kerman. This route, owing to its length and the scarcity of supplies and fodder, was rarely used by other than South Persia Rifles convoys. Detachments were maintained by the South Persia Rifles at Sirjan, Bandar Abbas and various immediate points. A South Persia Rifles convoy was attacked on this road between Ab-i- Din and Gakum in the beginning of May by a band of robbers. The robbers were pursued and the camels and loads recovered. Two of the robbers were killed and 3 wounded. The South Persia Rifles had no casualties. Owing to the unsatisfactory attitude of Agha Haji Kalantar of Tarum towards the South Persia Rifles, and his refusal to provide Tufangchis for Ab- i-Din post, the road became unsafe in June and on the recommendation of the Officer Commanding, South Persia Rifles and His Majesty's Consul, the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, agreed that it should no longer be used and that all caravans should proceed by the Baft-Daulatabad-Bandar Abbas road. 2. Bandar Ahhas-Daulatahad-JBaft-Kerman. This route which is the shortest and best supplied is the one generally used by merchant caravans except during the month or two during which the passes are blocked by snow. The South Persia Rifles till its disbandment maintained small levy post 8 at important points on the route which remained comparatively safe through out the year. A band of Farsi robbers raided the road in the end of July and looted 60 unloaded camels belonging to a British Indian subject and an upward post. 3. Bandar Ahhas-Budhar-Jiruft-Kerman. This route is used when the Daulatabad-Baft road is closed and to a certain extent at other times of year, and has, thanks to the good order maintained by Zargham-us-Saltaneh and to the presence during the greater part of the year of a South Persia Rifles detachment at Bam, been safe throughout the year. In November a party of Baluchs raided this road but were attacked by a small force raised by the Deputy Governor, Jiruft, supported by a few Bakhtiari sowars who happened to be in the district at the time and their leader and two robbers were killed. 4. Kerman-Yezd. This route has, as usual, been continuously harassed by robbers from Pars, who were specially active during the latter part of the year owing to the news of the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles. In September Amir Shaukat, chief of the Qarasuran department, visited the road with a number of Bakhtiari sowars provided by the Governor-General. In October the Governor-General urged upon the Persian Government the necessity for budget provision being made for an additional 100 sowars for guarding the road. The proposal was sanctioned but no extra men were engaged, a party of 40 sowars already serving at Kerman merely being trans ferred to the road and placed under the Bakhtiari Deputy Governor of Rafsin- jan who was made responsible for the security of the road in place of Amir Shaukat. Notwithstanding the posting of this detachment there was little improvement in the security of the route which continued unsafe until the close of the year. British Indian merchants alone lost goods to the value of Krans 238,455- 40 on this road. At the Governor-General's request these merchants sent a representative to Pars with a Mamur deputed by the Governor-General to recover the stolen property. The representative had not returned up to the close of the year, but there appears to be little prospect of either the stolen property or compensation being recovered.28 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE The levy of ralidari was recommenced during the year, the road guards compelling carriers to certify that they have paid no rahdari. Trade in general has been much hampered through the insecurity on this road. 6. Kerman-Meihed. This road also has been generally insecure and liable to raids by Pars bands. Goods worth Krans 1,100 belonging to a British Indian trader were robbed on the road for which compensation has not yet been obtained from tbe local authorities. ft. Kerman-Bam. No important robberies have taken place on this road during the year. In two cases of petty robbery Sardar Mujallal, Deputy Governor of Bam and Narmashir, succeeded in recovering the stolen animals from the Baluch robbers concerned. Postal Service. The new postal service opened in 1920 between Duzdab and Kerman worked most satisfactorily throughout the year and has greatly benefited business interest in both Kerman and Yezd. In September the cost of the service was reduced from Tumans 360 to Tumans 250 per mensem. South Persia Eifles. The Brigade was commanded by Major C. C. Crick until 26th January when he proceeded on leave. Major VV. E. D. Campbell commanded from this date until the final disbandment of the fdrce in October. In March a column of 1 squadron cavalry, 2 companies infantry and 1 section mountain battery under command of Captain Prior proceeded to Ispahan which they reached without incident and where they were eventually disbanded. In July the head-quarters of the 2nd Infantry was transferred from Saida- bad to Kerman, about 250 men only under the command of a Persian officer being left to garrison the posts at Saidabad and Gakum. The disbandment of the force was commenced in July and completed by the end of October. Thanks to the excellent discipline existing in the force the disbandment took place without incident, all arms and Government pro perty being surrendered without trouble. Trade. The trade of the province was much hampered by the suspension of ex change business on India on the part of the Imperial Bank of Persia. This entailed heavy losses to the British Indian firms, who conduct the greater part of the import trade of the province, and who were unable to remit rupees to India to meet their liabilities in that country. Transport rates were low varying from 18 to 40 Tumans per Kharwar (683 lbs.) from Bandar Abbas to Kerman. The Kran exchange has fluctuated between 285 and 386 for 100 Rs. and the sterling between Krans 36 and Krans 56'75. Owing to the opening of the Duzdab railway few goods were forwarded from Kerman to Khurasan the requirements of that province being supplied chiefly from Duzdab via Sistan. The following table shows the approximate amount and value of the main rticles of merchandise imported from Bandar Abbas to Kerman and Bam, ex-PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 29 eluding goods in direct transit to Yezd vid Bafsinjan and goods imported for Sirj an and other outlying districts : — I mpobtbd iwto K human.

Owing to the falling off of the (femand for articles of luxury in America and Europe due to the general financial stringency there was a marked decrease in the value of carpets exported, the figure for the year under review being £ 125, 760 as compared with £ 161,713 in the previous year. British Interests. Indo-European Telegraph Department. —Mr. E. M. Norris held the post of Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Kerman Sub-division till the middle of February when he was relieved by Mr. J.

Dalton continued in charge of the Kerman branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia till the end of May when he was relieved by Mr. E. A. Ayrton who held charge till the close of the year. The Bank continued to do exchange business on a very restricted scale throughout the year. The exchange rates during the greater part of the year were very high and British Indian firms had, in some cases, to sell their stocks at a heavy loss. Two firms failed during 1921.

Hussein Agha, Itimad-ud-Tujjar, head o£ the firm of Ali Akhar and Sons of Manchester, arrived in Kerman from Shiraz in July and proceeded to Yezd and Tehran. The object of his tour was to settle certain outstanding claims against merchants in Shiraz, etc., and to study the possibility of extending his business in Persia. A survey party arrived in July from England to inspect the Bahr Asman copp6r mines near Eabur in Kerman province. They completed their ins pection and returned via India in the end of August, Mr. Maclaren, the Engineer in charge informed His Majesty's Consul that he did not anticipate any immediate activity at the Bahr Asman mines. Captain Watts, Intelligence Officer, Persian Gulf, visited Kerman in October. The total number of cases settled by the Karguzari under Consulate super vision, including cases in which the interests of Eoreign subjects or firms and of British-protected Persian subjects were concerned was '44 and compensation recovered amounted to Krans 43,942-05.

Gunter, O.B.E., was in political charge of the Mekran Coast throughout the year. Gun-running. —4 Mauser rifles, 203*303 Service rifles, 17 Martini rifles 7 pistols and 28,500 rounds of ammunition were landed at the different places on the Mekran Coast during the year. Persian-Baluchistan. —-No incident of a serious nature occurred in the country during the year under report. The chief events of the year are given below At the end of Eebruary, in an affray which took place between the followers of Mir Burkat of Biyaban and Mirza Khan of Budbar, several people were killed on both sides. Bahram Rind who along with his brothers was responsible for shooting of sepoys of Charbar detachment in 1919, and Maulvi Abdullah of Hait in Sirbaz district who was inflaming the populace of his country during the course of the great war to take up arms against the British Government and was believed to have insti gated outrages against the officers serving in Baluchistan as well as against the Charbar detachment, made overtures through Mir Din Mohamed to make peace with the Government. After correspondence with the Political Agent, Kalat, the chief was told that the Maulvi and Bahram Rind should present themselves to the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, and provided responsible chiefs went security for their future behaviour, forgiveness would be granted and no action taken against them. They do not appear to have gone to the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, as no further news was received. In March, Chirag, son of Mir Jdustafa Khan of Jask, kidnapped a line- guard of the Jask sub-division for giving reports of the sailings of slave dhows. The lineguard was released after payment of 520 dollars. This money was refunded later by Mir Mustafa Khan whose subsidy was provisionally stopped for not giving due protection to the telegraph employees. The chief was fined Rs. 100 of which moiety was paid to the lineguard as compensa tion. Khalifa Khair Mohamed who was responsible for destroying the tele graph lines between J ask and Charbar and attacking the latter station in the year 1915 paid a visit to the Assistant Superinten dent of the Jask sub-division with a view to be pardoned by the Government for his past misbehaviour. He was informed that he should make his request in writing. Mir Bahram Khan, chief of Bampur, who raided a part of British Mekran in 1915, died in August. Mir Dost Mohamed was reported to have taken possession of the fort at Bampur. Kader Bukhsh Purdil Khan who wrecked telegraph lines near Suntsar and was reported to have looted both British Indian and Mekran Subjects, was shot by the order of Mir Din Mohamed Khan. Claims. —Two old claims amounting to Rs. 2,188 made by the British Indian Subjects against the late Sirdar Syed Khan, chief of Gaih, were settled by gradual deductions made from the telegraph subsidy of Sirdar Husain Khan, his son.32 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE Foreign Subjects.—Uto subjects of any foreign European powers resided at the ports of the Mekran during the year.

Both cholera and small-pox appeared at Gwadur and a large number of people fell victims to the two diseases. Slave traffic. —The slave traffickers have shewn great activity during the present year. A number of slaves were reported to have left different places on the Mekran Coast in dhows for sale on the Arab Coast. Famine. —There was great famine in Mekran on account of no rain having fallen during the year. Hundreds of people came to Karachi, Muscat, etc., to seek livelihood. Sirdar Husain Khan and Mirs Subhan and Ahmed came to Karachi I d connection with purchase of foodstuff. At their request, telegraph subsidies for half-year ending 30th June were paid to them in advance. Mr. J. S.

This was the first time that the chief came into the compound of the station after his arrest by the Military at Jask and deportation to Bushire. Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., with British Vice-Consul, Bushire, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bunder Abbas, came to Jask in September. C haebar. Mr. W. 'W. D. Cumming was relieved on 30th April by Mr. R. Hannah. The latter was in charge of the. telegraph station to the close of the year. Persian Customs. —Mirza Abbas was Relieved by Mr. Simon at the end of July. The latter carried on the duties of the Collector of Customs for the rest of the year. Tbe Customs paid a subsidy to Husain Khan, Mirs Din Mohamed Mabmud Khan and Yahya Khan for the protection of the Charbar Customs' As the lion's share of the subsidy went to Sirdar Husain Khan, being a son of the late Sirdar Syed Khan, paramount chief of the Persian Mekran, Mir Din Mohamed contended that he and not Husain Khan who was far away from Charbar protected the Customs and that Charbar was in his territory and thus claimed customs subsidy paid to Husain Khan. As Din Mohamed's claim was a strong one and as the question was becoming a great source of trouble it was arranged that Din Mohamed should get 60 per cent, of the subsidy' Husain Khan and Mahmud Khan 13^ per cent, each and Yahya Khan 13 per cent. The arrangement thus arrived at is open to revision after every six months if necessary. J Walis.—M.w Nindu was relieved by Shahdad Abbas and Chakar in Mav as Mahmud Khan's Walis of Oharbar.

NAVARRA'S REPORT DATED 17 th DECEMBER 3921 ON THE CONDI TION OF THE COUNTRY BETWEEN BIYABAN AND BAHU. B iyaban D istrict. Mir Burkat is still Zabit of the district and his methods of administration have been very satisfactory. After many years he has now resumed entering Jask station as already reported and his relations with us continue to be very cordial. He has had some trouble with Mirza Khan of Rudbar and a few of the Bashakard tribes and they were contemplating a fight but fortunately they have come to peaceful terms now and Mir Burkat has returned to his seat of administration at Goshki. Minab is administered by Abbas Khan a relative of Mir BurVat and as they are on very good terms I think the peace between Biyabanies and Mina- bies will be kept up. J ask D istrict. Jask district is managed by Mir Mustafa Khan and his son Murad. The junior sons also control certain other sections of his district. From recent informations obtained, the Jask district extends from Koh Mobarak to Malkani Chedag or the west bank of the river Sadaich. Mir Burkat has also a half share in the revenue. As previously reported by my predecessor in 1920 regarding Mir Mustafa Khan*s weakness and lack of influence in the adminis tration of Jask district, I am sorry to have to say that is absolutely the case. When Mir Burkat called at Jask the matter was represented to him and they had a meeting in which Mir Burkat gave Mir Mustafa Khan a sound bit of advice and told him that if they could not manage the district he (Mir Burkat) would have to come to Jask. Mustafa Khan and Murad assured him that they would do their best and if Mir Burkat intended to come to Jask, Mustafa*Khan would emigrate to the Arab coast. As Mir Burkat has a great brotherly affection towards Mustafa Khan they decided to let him stay on. Since then the matter has slightly improved. I have met Mirs Murad Chiragh and Mir Noor Mohamed of Gabreg (latter is a half brother to Mir Burkat). They all havo shewn signs of extreme friendship and have assured me that they would be loyal to the Government and assist us as much as possible. In matter of fact all the abovenamed chiefs appeared to me quite nice, respect able and stately looking, but the trouble is that they are surrounded by a handful of followers, of the lowest human type, a mixture of Africans and Baluchies who misguide these headmen and invariably get them into trouble. As the chief's life is in the hands of his followers, he has to keep quiet. Mir Hoti of Jask, a subsidised chief is a brother-in-law to Burkat and Mustafa Khan. He tries to do his best but unfortunately he has very little influence in the district. He is very loyal to our Government. B int D istrict. From information obtained, this district extends from Sadaich river to Balband 3 miles west of Bir. I believe this division has been made since Syed Khan's death. It is managed by the sons of Islam Khan and his brother Mir Nagdi Khan. One of the sons, Mir Yahya Khan is subsidised and Mir Nabi Bukhsh, a relative of Mir Burkat and a half brother to Yahya and Ayub hasPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 35 also a share in the management of the district but gets no share in the subsidy. He visited me at Jask some time ago and complained about this. Through the Karwan district managed by the aboyenamed chiefs our telegraph lines have suffered very badly. This is entirely due to wilful damages done by a tribe called the Sengala who are absolute Mohamedan fanatics and since the importa tion of metal from Muscat has been stopped, they are removing material from our lines. I found iron post being riddled with bullets, wooden posts cut all round, any amount of broken insulators appear near the posts, clamps are removed tor making shovels and stalks for the making of sharp implements. As the men of this district are of a very religious type and absolutely wild, I think the only man who can control them and restore order through the Kar- wan district would be Kalifah Khair Mohamed. Gaih District. Prom information obtained I understand that the district from Balband to Charbar is called Gaih. It is managed by Sirdar Husain Khan who is still young. So far the district is well administered and the telegraph lines are some how protected satisfactorily. I hear that Sirdar Husain Khan is very much upset over the recent settlement of the share which he used to get from the Persian Customs at Charbar and is making preparations to give Mir Din Mohamed Khan a blow. He has sent me message assuring that although he is very much upset and grieved, the way the case was decided by the British Government, he will still remain loyal and see to the protection of the telegraph lines as before. Dashtyari District. This district, I understand, extends from Charbar to Talli near Mazar Koh 10 miles west of the river Chill along the coast and inland from Charbar to the Chill river. The district is managed by Mir Din Mohamed Khan and Mahmud Khan. The administration seems to be very satisfactory and as they are related to the chiefs controlling the Bampur district, Mir Din Mohamed has therefore great influence and is level headed and considered a strong man now-a-days. He appears to be very loyal to the British Government. Bahu District. This district extends from Chill river to Samankaur inland through which country the new telegraph line runs. It is managed by joint chiefs Mirs Subhan Klianand Ahmed Khan. On the coast the district supposed to extend from Talli near Mazar Koh to Gwateg but according to the Chief's statement they claim up to Darabol. This district is also managed by Mirs Subhan Khan and Ahmed Khan but latter is the stronger man and more level headed. It appears there has been no trouble in this district. The chiefs have behaved quiet and uninterfering and treat their subjects with kindness and justice. General. There has been no rainfall up to November 1921 and famine conditions still appear to be imminent. Most of live stock have died and camels are in a most weak condition. They now have started ploughing with camels and it will take a considerable time before the country resumes its normal condition. The anti-British feeling is getting much better now although the people are still independent and defiant. I think this is entirely due to their ignorance and religious feeling. The chiefs seem to have little control over them. The political situation has improved and our relations with all the chiefs are friendly so far.36 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CHAPTER V.

The^ EorCe is not as attractive as it used to be, and the number has gradu ally diminished. The total is now about 90. Several Constables resigned, and others deserted on account of not receiving regular payment of their salaries. Adliyeh. —The Judicial Court instituted practically ceases to exist now. Most of the petty cases are referred to the Police Commissioner, and the more important ones to the Sheikh. JBeladiyeh. This department continues to work as indifferently as ever, and although a certain amount of work is done, such as sweeping of the Principal streets, lighting, there is room for great improvement, ii only the Local Authorities wouid appoint a Rais w r ho would not pocket most of the money collected in taxes. Consular Uscort. —Two local Persians still act as guards during the day and the Sheikh arranges for Ghulams as night guards. CWtow.—This department worked under Monsieur Andrieux as Director throughout the year. Several confiscation of smuggling goods were made. In the Persian month of Dalve (January-Pebruary) the Customs published a noUce, prohibiting the export of specie. In spite of the order several hundreds of thousands of Krans and^ Rupees were smuggled out of Mohammerah to Basrah' and several confiscations were made. Strict measures Jiad to be adopt ed by the Customs and the Sheikh, as the Imperial Bank of Persia made representations that the reserve stock of the Bank was continually reduced. Posts and Tele graphs.—The British Post and Telegraph offices at Moham merah were converted into a combined office in Eebruary, and again decom- bmed on 1st December 1921.38 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE In July the I. E. T. Department handed over the Arabistan line to the Persian Authorities, and they now have their office in the town. The Karguzar addressed a letter to the Consulate, protesting against the existance of the British Post and Telegraph offices in Arabistan on the ground that the War was at an end, and that their existence is responsible for a serious loss of revenue to the Government. Beitish Interest. Anglo-Persian Oil Comfany, Limited. —During the year this Company has continued to expand at all centres in Persia. At its Refinery on Abadan Island extensive new plant has been laid down to deal with a greatly increased output of Crude Petroleum. Plant for fully refining both Petrol and Kerosine has been installed. Bawarda, situated about 1^ miles down river below Abadan is nearing completion, and both Crude oil and Petrol can now be loaded and stored there, thus eliminating the handling of dangerous Petroleum at the main Refinery. Extensions to the pipe lines have been effected to enable the Company to deal with its largely increasing requirements of Crude Petroleum. Further extensive areas are now being tested, at some of which oil has been struck during the year. The Company has during the year taken over from the Military Authori ties in Mesopotamia several bulk and packed oil installations which will fi rther facilitate the Company's policy for the distribution of its products throughout the country. Messrs. Stride, Scott fy Co., Ltd. —This Company has continued its work as Managing Agents of Messrs. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, throughout the year. A new site of land of some 20 jarribs, adjoining their office building at Mohammerah, has been leased from the Sheikh, and on this several houses for the staff are now being built. Clerks' quarters are nearing completion, also roads for motor traffic. The work of making a road for motor cars from Mohammerah to Abadan is also in hand. • Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. T. Wilson, K.C.I.E., C .S .I., C.M.G., D.S 0., joined the Company as Resident Director and arrived at Mohammerah, which is his head-quarters, at the end of September. He was accompanied by a Secretary, Mr. H. R. Lowis. Messrs. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited, continued its work during the year. Mr. R. C. Row was Deputy Manager until June when he proceeded on leave and Mr. L. S. Parsons arrived from Bushire and took over charge. The Imperial Bank of Persia continued its work. Mr. E. M. Murray was Manager until ea^y December when he was transferred to the North, and Mr. H. G. Couser was appointed Manager and arrived from Bunder Abbas to take over charge Two Accountants are now employed at this branch. In November a Sub-Office was opened at Abadan and the Manager or Accountant proceeds there once a week for business. I understand that busi ness offering does not justify a more frequent attendance. Mr. A. Wright, Inspector of the Bank, arrived at Mohammerah on a tour of inspection in May, and, as a result of his recommendation, a branch was opened at Shushtar where Mr. Keith was appointed Manager, Quarantine and Health. —Assistant Surgeon C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., held the post of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. A few cases of plague occurred during the year, and quarantine restrictions were imposed against the port for a few months, on account of the town being declared infected. The Charitable Dispensary in the town continues to be well attended. Over 5,500 out-door patients were treated during the year. C. H. LINCOLN, H. B. M's Acting Consul for Arahistan, Mohammerah,PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 39 CHAPTER VI Annual Administration Report of the Abwaz Consulate, 1921. Personnel. Mr. E. G. B. Peel remained in charge of the Vice Consulate throughout the year. Inviewofthe recpenimg of the Dutch Consulate at Ahwaz His Majesty's Vice Consul, Ahwaz, was granted the local rank of Consul w T ith effect from July 1st. Captain 'Wallis continued to act as Assistant to His Majesty's Consul until October 1st when he took over charge of the Dizful Vice Consulate from Captain Elkington who had resigned from the service. Mr. K. M. Sahani, acting Head Clerk, resigned and was relieved on 1st July 1921 by Mr. Eahmatullah Khan from the Bahrein Political Agency. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ata Mohamed attached to the Ahwaz Civil Hospital was relieved on afternoon of 10th November 1921 by Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mehdi Hassan. Ahwaz and District. In spite of the total failure of the harvest and the complete withdrawal of all British and Indian troops from Arabistan no serious disturbances occurred during the year under report. An abortive conspiracy engineered at Mohammerah by Sheikh Chasip, Sirdar Arfaa, to oust his father from his position as ruling Sheikh has had a repercussive effect among the Arab tribes in the north of the District. Farhan Assad, Chief of the Shushtar Section of the A1 Kathir, intrigued with some of the Chaab Chiefs and collected a force with the intention of fighting Khallaf, the Sheikh of Mohammerah's representative in the Dizful Miyanab, but fled to Bakhtiari territory without putting up a fight as soon as Khallaf marched against him. The longstanding dispute between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Moin-ut-Tujjar regarding the ownership of land at Ahwaz has entered on a new phase owing to the firm stand made by the Sheikh in connection with a plot of land w r hich the Imperial Bank of Persia wished to buy. Although this land is strictly speaking within the area covered by the Moin-ut-Tujjar's concession from the Persian Government the Sheikh on the strength of firmans which he holds from the Persian Government offered to sell it outright to the Bank and to indemnify the latter against any claims brought by a third party. The Bank agreed on condition that no money should pass until the sale deed had been registered in the Persian Poreign Office. As soon as the deed had been registered and the money paid, the Moin endeavoured to bring pressure to bear on the Cabinet and the Governor-General at Shushtar with a view to contest ing the Sheikh's title to the land. The Sheikh countered by issuing a notice to all the Moin's tenants to the effect that they must take out fresh leases signed by himself. The Moin has now realized that the Sheikh is too strong for him and has ceased to make official representations. In May 1921 the question of the future status of the Khasraj tribe and of those elements of the Cbanana Section of the Beni Lam tribe which are permanently domiciled in Persian territory between the Kharkeh and the Duwairij rivers was settled in consultation with the Political Eesident at Bushire and His Excellency The High Commissioner at Baghdad. The Khasraj tribe, although of Persian origin and Persian domicile, was for some years controlled by the ruling Sheikh of the Beni Lam of Iraq. The40 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE tribe is now recognised as entirely subject to the control of the representatives of the Persian Government in Arahistan and the Sheikh of Mohammerah has made himself responsible for its affairs. The Drisat sub-section of the Chanana Section of the Eeni Lam is in a different category. Although of Beni Lam origin it has been domiciled in Persian territory for many years. It has now been definitely decided that this sub-section shall owe no allegiance to the Iraq Government. The Sheikh of Mohammerah pays the ruling chiefs a subsidy of tomans 200 per mensem and hopes in time to bring the tribe within his own jurisdiction. At present the tribe is nominally under the control of the Persian Deputy Governor at Dizful. D izful and S hushtae. These places form the subject of a separate annual report by His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul at Dizful and reference will only be made here to points of general interest. In the last administration report reference was made to the financial crisis due to {a) the withholding of the greater part of the Customs allotment which had hitherto provided funds for the expenses of the Governor-General at Shushtar and {h) the refusal of the Sheikh of Mohammerah to pay the revenue due from him to the Persian Government until his claim for re-imbursement of sums spent on behalf' of the Persian Government during the war had been met. The financial crisis became still more acute in April when all special political credits from the Mesopotamian Administration ceased. His Britannic Majesty's Consul left for Tehran in June with the object of obtaining the sanc tion of the Persian Government to the budgets which had been prepared, in consultation with the local head of the revenue department for the Persian Administration at Dizful and Shushtar, and the ratification of the arrangement made by Vossughed Dauleh whereby the arrears of revenue unpaid by the Sheikh of Mohammerah during the war wei?e to be set against his claim, and half revenue only demanded from him for a period of 6 years subsequent to Nau Euz 1920. After much discussion and with the active assistance of His Excellency Zahir-ul-Mulk, Governor-General designate of Arabistan, the Dizful and Shushtar budgets were eventually accepted in full by the Persian Government. Efforts to regularise the portion regarding the Sheikh's revenue were not so successful. In view of the approaching session of the Majliss the Cabinet were unable to agree to the proposal that half revenue should be paid for 6 years but agreed to the waiving of all arrears of revenue unpaid during the war and communicated this decision officially to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The latter who had hitherto refused to pay even half revenue on the ground that he had not been officially informed of the original arrangement now somewhat paradoxically insisted that the arrangement made by Vossuq-ed-Dauleh should hold good and refused to accept the decision of the Qawam's Cabinet. At the urgent request of His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, the Sheikh paid some 22,500 tomans of revenue during 1921, but refuses to pay more until the Persian Government agree to a complete revision of his budget. According to the budget now proposed the Persian Government would make themselves respon sible for much of the expenditure on law and order services hitherto borne by the Sheikh and the latter's net annual revenue would be permanently reduced to half the figure at which it stood before the war. In these circumstances, and in view of the refusal of the Bakhtiari Khans to pay revenue on their Arabistan estates, the financial position in Northern Arabistan affords considerable ground for anxiety more especially as the main tenance of law and order in this region is now entirely dependent on the punc tual monthly payment of subsidies to local chiefs. Thanks to the presence of a reliable Governor-General at Shushtar in the person of His Excellency Zahir-ul-Mulk and of a particularly capable and scrupulous Deputy Governor at Dizful, Mirza Abdullah Khan, it has been found possible to relinquish altogether without loss of efficiency the direct control exercised by His Majesty's Vice Consul, Dizful, during the past few years over the Persian Administrative departments at Dizful and Shushtar.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 41 Lynch Eoad. 'For the fourth year in succession the road has been safe for caravans throughout the year. The average rate charged for goods carried from Ahwaz to Ispahan was 12-36 per Shah Maund as compared with Krans 11-60 in 1920. The maximum rate of hire was 16 Krans a Shah Maund compared with 17 Krans in 1920, and Krans 30 in 1919. Eates would have been considerably cheaper had it not been for the total absence of fodder on the portion of the road which lies between Bakhtiari territory and Ahwaz. Bakhtiari. Amir Mufakham IllKhani and Murteza Quli Khan IllBegi accompanied by Amir Mujahid reached Ram Hormuz early in January. His Britannic Majesty's Consul visited them at Behbehan in February and found them very much perturbed by the threat of Bolshevism in Tehran. Their attitude at this time is sufficiently indicated in the following telegram which was despatched from Behbehan to His Britannic Majesty's Minister on February 16th at their request:— ' I have now discussed Persian situation fully with the Khans whose views may be considered representative not only of Khans as a whole but of all saner elements in the country. Their dominating anxiety is to prevent the spread of Bolshevism in Persia. They feel that an emeute in Tehran should be fore stalled at all costs but are reluctant themselves to march on Tehran as this would dissipate their forces and lay them open to suspicion of aiming at sovereignty with the help of the British. If the Shah leaves Tehran they will concenlrate at Ispahan and await developments but this may not prevent civil war between North and South into which the Russians and ourselves would inevitably be drawn directly or indirectly. They wish to act throughout as trustees for the Persian constitution and they can best do this by using all their influence to support a policy which will at once be popuUr in Tehran, cut the ground from under the feet of the Bolshevics and rehabilitate British prestige in Persia. Persia is at present much in the same position as in 1909 except that the British Government now stands where Russian Government stood then. This anomaly would only be aggravated if the Shah retired to Kermanshah under our protection. They consider that the only solution which will save Persia is the rein- troduction of the Morgan-Shuster regime backed by an American loan, and the abandonment of the Anglo-Persian agreement pro tern. The advantages of this course are as follows :— Firstly. —It will provide an admirable counterblast to the projected Russo-Persian agreement. Secondly. —British altruism will be vindicated and an immediate reaction in our favour will ensue. Thirdly. —The Shah will remain afc Tehran. Fourthly. —It will provide a rallying point for all sane elements in Tehran and more especially enable the Bakhtiaris through Samsames Sultan eh to take a strong line in support of the constitution. Persian administrative reform can still be carried out. It may be regarded as axiomatic that the Khans will in any circumstances do their utmost to protect our interests which they feel acutely to be identical with their own and will not move without fullest consultation with us. I venture to submit that their views merit the most serious consideration.', n administration report of the 4i2 Sewed Zia ud Din's coup d'eioi occurred shortly afterwards and the Khans' anxietv continued to be fed by rumours to the efFectthat Seyyed Zia intended to crush Bakhtiari with the help of Sirdar Zaflar. Seyyed Zia s Bakhtian programme was steadily opposed by His Britannic Majesty's Minister in Tehran and his tenure of office was in any case not sufficiently prolonged to enable him to carry any of his Anti-Bakhtiari schemes into effect. Before leaving for the North the IllKhani and IllBegi visited the Oilfields where they concluded an important agreement with the Company in regard to the purchase of land required by the latter. They also visited Ahwaz where they were the guests of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. His Britannic Majesty's Consul left for Tehran in June and returned to Ahwaz in October. He endeavoured while in Tehran to negotiate an agree ment between the Khans and the Oil Company providing for the deposit of the former's share scrip with the Company in return for a large loan to be issued to the Khans on the security of the scrip. The agreement ultimately fell through owing to difficulties in connection with the deduction of income tax by the British Treasury from dividends accruing to the Khans. In the meantime Sirdar Zaffar who was badly in need of funds was doin^ his best to secure the resignation of the IllKhani and IllBegi and his own return to Bakhtiari as IllKhani. He was supported somewhat half heartedly by Amir Jang and Sirdar Muhtasham. In order to end the tension between the rival parties it was thought best to encourage a trial of strength between them. Sirdar Zaffar was assisted by His Majesty s Legation in obtaining a loan from the Bank on the security of his oil shares and left for Isnahan with Amir Jang with the avowed determination of breaking the power of Amir Mufakham and Murteza Quh Khan. He arrived m Chahar Mahall secretly and at once began to arm his retainers, collect revenue and interfere in every possible way with the administration. This direct challenge was accepted by the IllKhani and IllBegi and Sirdar Zaffar was ordered to leave Bakhtiari within 48 hours or fight. The great majority of the Khans sided with the IllKhani and I^egi and after further mediation by Sirdar Fateh and Amir Jang Sirdar Zaffar a creed to stay quietly at his house until a conference of al the representative Khans could be convened at Ispahan. The conference took place m November and resulted in a patched up peace between the rival parties. Sirdar Assad remains at Kerman, Sirdar Ash]aa succeeds his brother Sirdar Muhtasham at Ispahan and Sirdars Zaffar and Mahtasham are to accompany the IllKhani and IllBegi to the low country in the approaching spring. Ihe Khans inten tions are for the moment somewhat obscure, but they are reported to be brincinc south an exceptionally large number of troops with the intention of coercmar the Sheikh of Mohammerah into ceding a portion of the lands of the late Nizam-us-Sultaneh in Arabistan. It is also reported from private sources that a defensive alliance has been concluded between the Bakhtiari Khans Saulat-ed-Dauleh and Qawam-ul-Mulk with a view to protecting their common interests against aggression by the Central Government. An association called the ' Sitarayi Bakhtiari' has been formed by some of the youneer Khans. Its object is social reform in Bakhtiari and its programme strongly reflects Soviet doctrines. It is not taken seriously by the senior Khans. Kuhgiltj. In spite of famine conditions in and around Behbehan the Bakhtiari Governors met with considerable success in dealing with the Kuhgilu tribes. His Majesty's Consul's visit to Behbehan had been widely advertised and rumours spread of the despatch of mountain guns Certain chiefs, notably Muzaffar Khan of Aru held off until His Majesty's Consul a.ctually reached Behbehan but then came in at once. The only defaulter was Ah Murad Khan of the Sarhadi Taybi. The Sarhadi 'laybi and the Dushman Ziari, the two tribes who invariably raid the Lynch Boad were handed over to Sartip Khan of the Garmsir Taybi and to Shukrullah Khan of the Sarhadi Boir Ahmedi respectively. All Murad Khan evacuated his fort, Eaisi, which was afterwardsPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 43 occupied by Sartip Khan, and Shukmllah Khan was made to furnish heavy security in Behbehan for the good behaviour of the Dushman Ziari. Anglo-Persian Oil Company. % Several new wells have been drilled at Maidan (i) Naftun with 'ood results and outside tests are making good progress. The production which is regulated in accordance with orders from London has considerably increased and has necessitated the construction of further subsidiary pumping stations and the laying of auxiliary pipe lines. Communications have been improved owing to the completion of the bridges under construction over the Tembi and Eahdar rivers.. A lio-ht railway is in course of construction which will link up Dar-i-Khazineh with the Main Oilfields and thus increase the facilities for transporting heavy material. A new site of some 60 acres just above the town of Ahwaz has been obtained from the Sheikh of Mohammerah and on this it is proposed to built a self-contained colony for the local staff of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Hitherto they have been housed in buildings scattered throughout the Persian town. Medical. Major A. C. Oldham, Civil Surgeon, died of heatstroke on July 19th No successor had been appointed up to the end of the year. It is now proposed to abolish the Civil Hospital and resuscitate the old Charitable Dispensary Facilities for the treatment of European residents as well as for the Persian and Indian staff of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will be provided by the Oil Company's 'new hospital at Ahwaz where at least one qualified medical officer and two nursing sisters will reside permanently. 2 ,236 outdoor and 221 indoor patients were treated at the Civil Hospital during the year. ^ 14 major and 175 minor operations were performed.

The Post Office at Mohammerah had been in existence for many years before the war but subsequently came under the control of the Mesopotamian administration The Persian Government maintain that the existence of British (or Indian) post offices in Arabistan is a violation of the International Postal Convention and is responsible for a serious loss of revenue to the Government On the other hand it is urged that the existence of thousands of Indian emplovees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Arabistan renders a system of monev order remittances necessary, a system which the Persian Government have not R n organised. The whole question is still under discussion. E. G. B. PEEL, B. B. Ml* Consul, Ahwaz,PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921 45 CHAPTER VIL Administration Report of His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consulate for Dizful and Shushtar, Dizful for the year ending 31st December 1921. DIZFUL. Personnel. Captain E. H. 0. Elkington, M.C., 36tli Sikbs, held charge as His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul until 30th September 1921. Captain C. Wallis, Q. V. 0. Corps of Guides (Cavalry), assumed charge as His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul from the 1st October 1921. Khan Sahib Mirza Mahmood Khan held the post of Head Munshi, Dizful. Sher Zaman Khan held the post of Head Clerk and Accountant, Dizful, up to 30th September 1921. Mirza Muhammad II held the post of Head Clerk and Accountant, Dizful, from 1st October 1921. Political- Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, brother of Viqar-ul-Mulk, remained as Deputy Goyernor, Dizful, until the end of June. He paid little attention to his duties being constantly sick in Hospital in Ahwaz and when in Dizful did liltle else than extort money to enable him to make up for his meagre salary. Mirza Ali Akbar Khan accompanied his brother Viqar-ul-Mulk early in July to Tehran, when the latter proceeded to take up his seat in the Majliss. His Royal Highness Muayyad-us-Sultan became Deputy Governor from 1st July until the arrival of Mirza Abdullah Khan on 9th December 1921. He was a quiet man and did little to distinguish his period of office except in various attemps to collect money to make up for his salary which was reduced by Tehran to Tomans 150 per mensem. The following are some of the means used in obtain ing money ;—(«) Forcing litigants to appear before him instead of the Law Courts thus depriving the Law Court of its dues and indirectly causing it to become an expense to the Eevenue. {b) Directly collecting certain sources of indirect revenue in defiance of the Eevenue Department, (c) Encouraging and promoting disturbances, fights and fracases in the town or district and enjoying the fines inflicted on both parties, (d) Fining the butchers and bakers on accusations that they are charging exorbitant prices or adulterating the bread. H. B. H. Muayyad-us-Sultan left for Tehran shortly after the arrival of Mirza Abdullah Khan. Mirza Abdulla Khan who was met on his first arrival by a large 'Istiqbal' chiefly organized by this office caused a good impression and soon showed him- sslf to be a man of exceptional capabilities. Mirza Hassan Khan arrived from Tehran in April 1921 as Pishkar-i- Maliyeh which post he held during the year. A tour of north Arabistan soon convinced this official that Ahwaz was a more suitable place for him to make his headquarters than Dizful. T own. The condition of the town has been satisfactory throughout the year. Mirza Hassan acted as chief of Police until shortly after the arrival of Mirza Abdullah Khan when he was arrested for his extortions and sent to Shushtar. While he kept his man up to scratch and few cases of crime M ere reported, as \ I46 administration report or the it subsec uently transpired he was entirely in the hands of Mirza Mahmood who was dismissed for misbehaviour early in January 1922. Mirza Hassan was succeeded by Major Salar-i-Ehtesham who was formerly Chief of Police in Shushtar when he held far from a good record. Telegraphs. The telegraphs which were controlled by officials from the Mesopotamian Telegraph Department were handed over entirely toother with all instruments and Fines to the Persian officials in the middle of June. The Diztul-Shush phone line was also subsequently handed over and the Telegraph office moved from the vicinity of this office to the Deputy Governor's house. Law Courts. Moin -ul-Islam continued as Rais-el-A ^liyeh. Prom March to August the law courts were closed under telegraphic orders from Tehran issued by bayyid Zia-Din's cabinet when the law courts were under reform in Persia. Sagwand Levy. The Sao'vrand Levy composed of two sections of Sagwands and one section of Kurds remained under the command of Lieut. A. Amos until his departure on leave in March 192V. The two fighting Pord cars and their Indian personnel woe withdrawn on the departure of the military from Ahwaz early in the year. The work of the Levy whicn was chiefly confined to the protection of cultivators and the pursuit of robber bands was satisfactory. School. The school for boys which was opened early in 1920 was supervised during the year by this Vice Consulate. The salaries of the teachers and other expenses were found by voluntary contributions. An attendance of some 40 to 50 boys has been obtained and considerable progress made during the year. Arrangements are being made to obtain a qualified teacher of English from Isfahan. District. The state of the district has been eminently satisfactory and the security gradually obtained by the presence of British troops and our administration, lias since their departure continued. In two cases only were caravans attacked and robbed. One of these was the robbing of a caravan proceeding from Dizful to Amarah in Chenana territory by a band of renegade Sagwands under the outlaws Sayyed Mohammad Khan and Mehr Ah Khan. Negotiations are proceedina' with the Wali of Posht-i-Kuh into whose territory the band fled with a view to the recovery of the looted property. The second robbery occurred late in the year on the Dizful-Shushtar road when a band of Qalawands from the hostile section of this tribe under Kadkhuda Fazil crossed the Diz during the low water period and carried oif two small caravans in the vicinity of Sarbishah. Pressure is being brought to bear on this cheif through Sadiq Khan when it is hoped to recover the stolen property. Considerable progress has been made in cultivation and irrigation and many new tracts of land have been sown. A dam has been built at Ajanb by Sheikh Khalaf the Sheikh- of Mohammerah's representative m the Mianao, and his Dizful Agent Qutb-us-Sadat which will greatly increase irrigation m the vicinity of the A jarib canal. A small post of sowars has been maintained at Shush during the year to afford protection to the chateau of the French Arch8eological Mission, to combat smuggling of opium and to give timely warning of tribal disturbances. Administration. The close of 1921 showed a great change in the administration of the town and district to the earlier part of the year. At the beginning of 1921PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 47 while Dizful had a Deputy Governor, he was little more than, Governor in name being almost entirely reliant upon the Dizful Vice Consulate for money with which to pay the necessary services of law and order. The position of the Deputy Governor was furthermore made difficult by the local townspeople and tribal chiefs who were most stubborn in doing all possible to remain under the control of the Vice Consulate rather than have anything to do with their own Governor whom they disliked. The administration of the district and relations with the subsidized tribal chiefs, the command of the Sagwand Levy had remained under the direct control of the Vice Consulate since the War. At the close of March credits from the Mesopotamian administration ceased and the entire cost of maintenance of the local administration, sowars and police was thrown upon the Revenue Department which, although its receipts had with the gradual improvement in security increased, was unable to meet the cost of these liabilities, some Rupees 8,300 per mensem. While His Britann c Majesty's Vice Consul, Ahwaz, was away in Tehran endeavouring to arouse some interest in Tehran in the future of Arabistan and obtaining the appointment of a capable and honest Governor General, the summer of 1921 was tided over with considerable difficulty by Bis Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul, Dizful. While he was unable to exercise control over the Revenue Department he was more or less responsible for the regular payment of the forces of law and order and was invariably besieged by hungry Levie Sowars and Chiefs unless their emoluments were punctually forthcoming. In June the position was made more difficult by telegraphic instructions being received by the Revenue Department from Tehran to suspend all payments. This difficulty was subsequently surmounted by the Governor General collecting the revenue and making payment on his own responsibility. Thanks to His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah who on one or two occasions during the summer of 1921 reimbursed the Treasury of the Revenue Department on representations made by His Majesty's Consular Officers in Arabistan, pay ments were regularly made. With the arrival of His Excellency Zahir-ul-Mulk as Governor General of Arabistan and the appointment of Mirza Abdullah Khan as Deputy Governor of Dizful in December, the control of the district, the Sagwand Levy and all other Departments was handed over to the Persian Officials. The r61e of His Majesty's Vice Consul has been changed from an administrative to an advisory capacity, a more fitting and tolerable position and one of less expense to His Britannic Majesty's Government. T ribal. Tribal affairs showed some improvements during the year. At the close of the year the only section remaining to be brought to submission was that of Kadkhuda Eazil chief of the hostile portion of the Qalawand tribe which robbed two caravans on the Shushtar road. The band of Sagwand outlaws under Sayed Mohammad Khan and Mehr Ali Khan with their following of sowars (deserters from the Levy) remained with Mezban Khan Sagwand in Posht-i-Kuh for the firsi half of the year. They made several attempts to raid over the Karkhah but met with little success owing to the vigilence of Sadiq Khan*the chief of the Sagwand tribe who drove them off. A specie caravan proceeding from Shush to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's workings at Dehluran was attacked by the band hut they were driven off with loss. In August Mehr Ali Khan with a few followers took refuge in Chenana territory near Shush. H e proceeded to try and raise forces to attack and oust Sadiq Khan with the assistance of Ghulam Reza Khan of the Amelah Lurs at Shush and Sheikh Makenzie of the Mushatat Arabs and bring about a Coup D'Etat which His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul would be forced to recognise and then make him chief. His Majesty's Vice Consul at once proceeded to Shush when Mehr Ali Khan fled. Ghulam Reza Khan and Sheikh Makenzie were both reproved and their salaries stopped for the time being. In September letters were received from Azzad-us-Sultan the Governor-General of Luristan suggesting that Sayyed Mohammad Khan and Mehr Ali Khan should proceed to Khurramabad48 administration report of the without delay and enter into his service. Happily both accepted this call and proceeded to Khurramsbad thus freeing the district of two outlaws. Except for the part taken in the above intrigues the Amelah Lurs and Hushatat Arabs were orderly throughout the year. All the subsidised tribal chiefs proceeded to Ahwaz early in the year to pay their respects to His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah who gave them presents and arranged for them to lease land for cultivation from him in the estates of Hnsseinabad and Bin Mualla. More effective arrangements for the control of the Khasraj and Chenana tribes were arrived at during the year. In the spring the Divisional Adviser of the Amarah Division, Mesopotamia, visited Dizful, accompanied by Sheikh Abdul Karim of the Bani Lam tribe of w r hich the Kbasraj and Chenana are subsections. It was arranged that Abdul Karim should appoint Sheikhs Zamil and Shaia of the Kliasraj and Chenana as his agents to control these sections which were situated on this side of the Duw^airi] in Persian territory under orders from the Ahwaz and Dizful Vice Consulates. Shortly after the return of Abdul ILarim to Amarah he was deposed by his tribe and the opportunity was taken to separate the Khasraj and Chenana from the Bani It wa ^ decided by His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad, that the khasra] and Chenana tribes should be considered as Persian subjects and His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah was asked to take hteps to ensure the maintenance of law and order in their territory. Sheikhs Zamil and Shaia who visited Ahwaz to see the Sheikh of Mohammerah were accorded a monthly allowance by him of Tomans 200 payable through the Dizful Vice Consulate under wh( se orders the chiefs were placed. They were further allowed the right to collect baj from caravans traversing the Shush-Amarah road which right had previously been in the hands of Sheikh Makenzie of tlie Mushatat Arabs. The reason for this change was that the Chenana tribe camps more on the Amarah road than the Mushatat Arabs and is therefore better able to afford adequate protection to those using the road. In April Sheikh Zamil intimated that he felt unable to control the Khasraj in addition to his portion of the Chenana as they had already moved considerably south. Arrangements were made with His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah for this tribe to be controlled through his Deputy in Ahwaz and one Hassan bin Taqi was appointed chief. Our relations with the Luristan tribes, Baharwand, Qalawand, Papi have been friendly and almost all their chiefs visited Dizl'ul on their return to Dizful territory for winter grazing. Char-Lang Bakhtiaris previous to their return to Eilaq in April proceeded to loot crops but their depredations were eventually stopped by Salar-i-Aazam the Bakhtiari Governor appointed by the Khans at Ab-i-Bid at that time. Since the return of the tribe from Eilaq for the winter they have been orderly. Trade. The general erudition of trade in Dizful can only be described as having been poor &amp; and stagnant throughout the year, the main cause being the state of exchange. Caravans have proceeded to and arrived from Khurramubad but the Luristan road is in reality closed. A caravan pays baj at six places enroute amounting to some Krans 60 per mule load and even then stands a big chance of being looted and held up for long periods. Imperial Bauk of Persia. The Correspondency of the Imperial Bank of Persia remained open during the year but as has since transpired the local ager t, Haji Mohammad Sadiq Felatoon was entirely in the hands of Mirza Mahmood and has since been suspended and the Correspondency closed with a sum of Krans 27,235-85 short from his cash. A document was drawn up by the Bank Correspondent with His Majesty's Vice Consul and the Shushtar Manager, authorizing the Bank to realize the security held should the amount not be made good within 41 days, and the money was eventually recovered in full. f lhe branch appears to have been of little use owing to the inability of the Bank to trust; theirPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 49 Correspondent with transactions of any big amount and their difficulty in supervising it. Messrs. Strick Scott &amp; Cot. The same remarks apply to this Agency as to the Imperial Bank of Persia. During the investigation of the position of the Bank Correspondency it was found that Haji Mohammad Sadiq Felatoon their Dizful Agent had a balance short of Krans 18,223 on account of sales of Kerosine Oil although he had sold the oil in many cases at higher rates than authorized and the Agency has been closed. Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd. The Ageney of this firm has progressed satisfactorily but business has been slack. Messrs. the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd. One or two caravans of specie and labour were sent to the Company's workings at Dehluran but the Shush-Dehluran road has hot been used to any extent at present. Enquiries were made by the Company regarding the position of the various tribes towards the close of the year as they are pre paring to send geologists to survey the Dalpira-Panjireh area. Dizful Bridge Company. The Dizful Bridge Company paid a yearly dividend of 6 per cent, on all shares and a sum of Tomans 1,000 was placed on fixed deposit with the Impe rial Bank of Persia to open a Reserved Pund. A considerable sum was ex pended on repairing the bases of some of the stone piers. The Company was somewhat hampered by the presence of heavy liabilities standing over from 1920 when a dividend of 18 per cent, was paid, and was therefore unable to declare a higher dividend than that above mentioned. Communications. The Dizful Shush-Ahwaz road remained open for all traffic including motors until December when after four days and nights of rain the Sabsaub stream and the Shaur river rose to such an extent that the wooden bridges over both streams which had been built by the Military Authorities during the war were washed away. The replacement of the Shaur Bridge by a permanent girder bridge which was one of the conditions on which His Majesty's troops were withdrawn from Shush was ruled by the Civil and Military authorities in Baghdad not to be necessary as the reasons for the original proposal no longer existed. It is hoped to persuade His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah to give the necessary funds when a permanent stone and pipe bridge will be built on a new site at Shush with a span of 60 feet, under the supervision of this office. The Sabsaub stream is being bridged at a cost of Tomans 1,000 by the Dizful Bridge Company under the supervision of this Vice Consulate. The motor road between Dizful and Shushtar via Papileh-Sarbishah-Ab-i- Bid- Gutwand and Qaleh Ali Rushan was used during the year but work is required at Papileh and in the Tang near Shushtar to make it a good road. General. In recording the good work of the Head Clerk and Accountant Slier Zaman Khan and Mirza Muhammad II who succeeded him in October and also of the staff of this Vice Consulate in general a few lines are necessary regarding Mirza Mahmood. This official who acted as Head Munshi to this Vice Consulate until it was decided in consultation with His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, to transfer him to Ahwaz late in the year, has since been dismissed from Government Service. It has been found that he has for the last 2^ years used his official position to facilitate the extortion of large sums of money from the people of Dizful and district. Through fear of reprisals and the precautions taken by Mirza Mahmood, such as turning people away (often with violence) people seem to have been unable to make their grievances o50 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE known to successive Political Officers and Vice Consuls. It is to be hoped that the dismissal of this person will vindicate the good name of His Britannic Majesty's Government in these parts and show that the oppressions and practices exercised have been hidden-from her officers. SHUSHTAR. Personnel. The excellent work of Khan Sahib Mirza Ali Khan who held charge as His Britannic Majesty's Consular Agent, Shushtar, throughout the year, is worthy of special note. The work of the staff of the Agency has been satis factory. Political. His Excellency Viqar-ul-Mulk was Governor General of Arabistan (his 7th visit) until July when he left to take up his seat in the Majliss. He was not popular and confined most of his attention to collecting sufficiaut money to enable him to leave for Tehran. He endeavoured to obtain an increase of Tomans 1,000 per mensem on his salary, being the amount allowed for the upkeep of 50 Bakhtiari sowars, but needless to say met with no success. He was succeeded by Ekram-ul-Mulk the Karguzar of Ahwaz. Ekram- ul-Mulk was a pleasant man socially and an improvement on Viqar-ul-Mulk but allowed his Chief of Police and Heads of Sowars too much rope with the result that they oppressed people whenever possible in his name. It was with great difficulty that he was prevailed upon to carry out a sentence of death on a murderer who had been convicted by his predecessor and whose finding had been comfirmed by Tehran. In November Ekram-ul-Mulk was relieved by His Excellency Zahir-ul- Mulk whose appointment was largely due to His Majesty's Consul, Ahwazl, when in Tehran in the summer. His Excellency Zahir-ul-Mulk on his arrivae asked for the assistance of His Majesty's officials without which he said, he knew, he was unable to work. He was promised our wholehearted assistance which was immediately utilized in obtaining a substantial sum from His Excellency the Sheikh of Mohammerah to reimburse the Eevenue Department to enable him to make an unhampered start in administration. He made an effort on his arrival to improve the sanitation of the town which matter badly required attention, with creditable results. His Excellency is now trying to obtain the sanction and financial assistance of the Central Govern ment in Tehran for the reconstruction of the Valariam Dam and Bridge the survey of which was completed by a British firm in 1920. Condition of the Town and District. There was a slight increase during the year in thefts and three or four murders were reported in the town and district. A number of robberies occurred in the Shushtar Mianab chiefly perpetrated by Arabs, on one occasion also the mail carrier was robbed. As a consequence of the poor crops gathered, prices were high and many vilfages in the Mianab were deserted the villagers proceeding north into Bakhtiari territory. Arrangements were made for wheat to be imported from India which resulted in a general drop in prices. A bad outbreak of smallpox occurred in the town during the hot weather and several hundred deaths, chiefly children, w r ere reported. Lymph which was obtained from Amarah proved to be a failure having apparently been damaged by heat en route. The supervision of those departments over which to some extent control bad remained in the hands of the Consular Agency towards the end of 1920 w r as entirely relaxed. The Revenue Department was taken complete charge of by the new Pishkar-i-Maliyeh Mirza Sayyed Hassan Khan on his arrival from Tehran. The summer was a difficult one for the Eevenue Depart ment ow T ing to the lack of funds, largely due to the renting of many of the sources of revenue at lower figures than previously. At one time the pay of the Governor General's sowars was two months in arrears. The Pishkar demanded that the fees collected for the settlement of cases should be paid toPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 51 his Department, but was met with strong opposition on this point by Viqar-ul- Mulk who was pocketing the fees himself. The Adliyeh remained open during the early part of the year but was eventually closed by Yiqar-ul-Mulk after receiving many complaints against His Eoyal Highness Muayyad-us-Sultan whom he had appointed to act as Rais-el-Adliyeh in place of Haji Mulla Ali. The Rais and Viqar-ul-Mulk between them stripped the law courts of what furniture they contained. Control of the Shushtar Telegraph Office together with instruments and lines was handed over to the Persian authorities and the office moved from the Consular Agency to its former building. Salar-i-Ehtesham acted as Chief of Police until the arrival of His Excellency Zahir-ul-Mulk who transferred hiin to Dizful and appointed his syce one Hassan Khan in his place. Several attempts were made during the year to enforce the collection of the Nawaqil tax until the people of the town formed gatherings as a protest and proceeded to the Consular Agency and the houses of the Chief Mujtihids. It was decided that collections should remain as before until the arrival of His Excellency Zahir-ul-M ulk. Zahir-ul-Mulk on his arrival on representations from the townspeople allowed collection to be continued on the same scale as previously. The guarding of the Shushtar-Dizful road remained in the hands of Sultan Muhammad Khan and Jaafar Quli Khan with their sowars. They performed their duties satisfactorily. Qubad Khan a rival of Sultan Muhammad Khan brought a letter from Murtaza Quli Khan to Ekram-ul-Mulk stating that he should be made the Chief of the Quarasurans on this road. Ekram-ul-Mulk endeavoured to make Sultan Muhammad Khan pay to be given a farman sav ing he would remain as chief. Kalantars and Deportees. Quli Khan who had been detained in Ahwaz was allowed to return to Shushtar on a guarantee of good behaviour given for him by His Excellenov the Sheikh of Mohammerah. ^ Several minor Kalantars were allowed to return to Shushtar from Ahwaz and Isfahan and sent to live in the Daimcheh estate which was also restored to the family during the year. The Consular Agency which was situtated in one of the Kalantar's houses was vacated and returned to them through the Governor General Humours were current towards the close of the year that Baqir Khan and Sawed Azizullah would be allowed to return. His Excellency Zahir-ul-Mulk is arranging for them to be made to live either in Kermanshah or Tehran. Bakhtiari. The fifty Bakhtiari sowars whom the Khans claim to have a ri^ht tn send for service in Shushtar under the Governor General against pavment of their revenue from the M'' estates, arrived in April. Being unable to obtain sufficient pay either from the Khans or from the Governor General thev soon lett the district. J wvu. Murtaza Quli Khan the Illbegi visited Ab-i-Bid where he was called on by the Governor General Viqar-ul-Mulk and others. All attempts to collect revenue from Bakhtiari estates during the year, failed.

The ' Shushan ' belonging to the former Corporation continued to ply between A.hwaz and Shelaili. The ' Moin ' steamer belonging to the Moin Company also made regular trips but the merchants appear to favour the 'Shushan.' An attempt was made by one Sayyed Mohammad Ali Mustowfi Shushtari to establish a motor boat service and one of his boats made a couple of trips from Ahwaz. He was eventually stopped under orders from Tehran. A considerable quantity of labour and craftsmen of all descriptions were recruited from Shushtar for Messrs. Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited at the Oilfields and Dar-i-Khazineh during the year by His Majesty's Consular Agency. Trade during the year is described by the merchants as having been bad owing to the rates of exchange. The import and export trade with Isfahan shows an increase of double the figures for the year 1920. C.

P ersonnel. Mr. R. E. L. Wingate, I.C .S., held charge of Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul till the afternoon of the 20th October when he was relieved by Major M. E. Eae, I.A., T\ho held charge till the end of the year. The post of the Agency Surgeon continued vacant. The Senior Medical Officer, Baital-Ealaj, officiated in charge of the Agency and Telegraph staff till the departure of the detachment on the 28th June. Sub-Assistant Surgeon P. P. Desouza remained in charge of the hospital throughout the year. Erench interests remained in charge of M. Vadala, the Erencli Consul at Bombay, who however did not pay any visit to Muscat. Khan Sahib Ehtisham-ed-douleh continued to be Dragoman of the Agency during the year. The Dragoman received the honour of Khan Sahib at the New Year, and in June Mr. Gazdar who had lately gone on leave after several years as head clerk of the Agency, and Mr. D'Mello, the present head clerk, both received the M.B.E. C ondition op C ountry. The year under report was the first since 1912 when an actual and stable state of peace existed between the Sultan's subjects on the coast and the tribes of interior Oman. The Agreement of SIB which was only concluded in October 1920 and which has been fully described in the last report, virtually established two states, the coast under the Sultan, and the interior, that is Oman proper, under the rule of the Imam, Muhamad. bin Abdulla al Khalili. The agreement, as the events of the year showed, had given great statisfaction to the tribes and the tribal leaders, the Imam and Sheikh Isa bin Salih al Harithi, who assured at last of non-interference from the Sultan, and having attained in their own eyes complete independence, occupied themselves entirely with their own affairs. Ereedom of intercourse was re-established, subjects of the Sultan who last year would not have dared risk their lives in the interior travelled with safety in Oman, many Omanis came down to the coast either to go on the H aj or to visit their properties in Zanzibar, and even the Pol tic al Agent was able to make a short tour in the Wadi Maawal where he was received with the greatest hospitality and cordiality. Oman is now ruled as was Arabia in the time of the Prophet. The Imam is the supreme temporal and religious head, and the tribal leaders have sworn allegiance to him. In actuality, however, there is complete tribal autonomy, and the Imam never interferes except in a dispute between two or more tribes. Should any important point of policy have to be decided the tribal chiefs are summoned in conclave by the Imam, and the latter will usually give his final order in accordance with the views of the stronger party. The only law is the religious law according to the Ibadhi dogma administered by the Qazis. Central government there is none, and though there are so called Walis in several places on behalf of the Imam, they are usually the sheikh of the tribes. The only form of taxation is the religious 'zakat' payable to the Imam, which is either collected by agents of the Imam in the date season or com pounded for lump sums in advance. This and the Bait-al-mal, that is various properties belonging to the state, are the only sources of revenue. Expen-£ , administration ueport of the diture consists in the payment of tribal levies when they are needed by the Imam for any specific purpose, and by far the heaviest item, the othga ory entertainment of sheikhs and their retinues. Politically the Imam has to steer a careful course between the great tribal factions, the Hinawi and the Ghafiri. Though for the moment comparative peace prevails, largely through the astute policy of Sheikh Isa, there are often small factional affairs which need careful handling to prevent their develop ment into serious tribal warfare. The position of the Lruiuiinsjchaconstitu- tion is both delicate and unsafe. Of this, as he cannot fail to be from the history of his predecessors, he is perfectly well aware. ^ id to please both parties, and never gives a decis.on if he can P^ly ^Oid doino- so The real ruler behind the facade of the Imam is Sheikh Isa bm Salih al Harithi, the paramount chief of Sharqiyah and the head ot the Hinawi confederation. To him Oman owes its independence and the Imam his riectinn. Though little is known of him, he is unquestionably one of the most remarkable figures in contemporary Arabian history. In religious matters, in contradistinction to the rule of the late Imam, toleration is the policy, and the Mutawwa party though still exercising great influence, has declined in power. In the government of the interior the chief event of the ^ar w as the effort of the Imam and Sheikh Isa to bring to book the murderer of the late Imam. The Al Wahaiba, a Bedouin tribe to whom the murderer belonged, were unable o, to g W. H. -p. «—f 1 r*jrt. 'T SJUPS the tribe and several of the sheikhs were imprisoned. As the ^rdeier had bv this time escaped to Trucial Oman, nothing however could be done, and the affair died down. Oman opinion held that the Imam had mismanaged it, as much by the needless expense he had incurred as by his lailure. An attempt was made by the Imam in August to include the Bam Battash and their country in his sphere of government, and a Wall and Qazi were des patched to the tribe. The Bani Battash who inhabit the country behind Ourvat have invariablv been subjects of the Sultan and were not parties on the Imam's side to the Agreement of Sib. The act was tl '® e£ ^ e ^ l g ^Ws ment of the clause in the agreement promising non-interference inthe Sultan government. The Political Agent was compelled to address a strong letter to Sheikh Isa on the subject. The affair was in fact an intrigue on the part of the Sheikh of the Bani Battash and in no way represented th « ^ ^ he3 0 '; ^ tribe. Though unimportant in itself, action was necessary to prevent such an example being followed. „ , , , The prolonged drought of over three years seriously affected the country and the date crop was below the average, while cereals practically wcnt o of cultivation and fodder was extremely scarce. Good rain at the ena ot the year has however greatly improved the prospects tor next year. There was a somewhat severe outbreak of cholera in the Semail -valley coincident with the Muttrah outbreak, m September. The diseas probably brought by Baluchis from Mekran moving into the interior tor date harvest. His Highness' Administration. {a) The ruling family. The actual administration was throughout the year carried on by the Council of Ministers inaugurated in October 1920, the personne remained unchanged. His Highness who had returned to Muscat from India November 1920, left again for India via Gwadur where he stayed to fortnight, in February of the year under report, and did ^ot return^again. During his presence in the capital as during his absence he too Ahdica- and did not interfere in any way in. the administration of the state Ab tion is still his aim, and failing this h^ uesires no responsibility, a large income, and to see his country and his people as little as pr 'PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 55 At the end of the year it was possible to give effect to the proposal which had long been under consideration, and which had received His Highness' consent, of sending his son Saiyid Said to the Mayo College at Ajmere. The services of Saiyid Sidiq Hassan, formerly Indian Assistant at Bahrain, have been obtained as tutor, and it is expected that Saiyid Said will leave for Ajmere in January 1922. Saiyid Hamad bin Eaisal, brother of the Sultan, remained as Wali of Sohar throughout the year and Administered his charge with ability. Saiyid Salim, another brother, joined the levies as an officer and has made considerable progress. Saiyid Abbas bin Muhamad bin Turki who has fled from Muscat in 1920 returned in September. {&amp;) Finances. Tor the year lot October 1920 to the 30th September 1921, the Muscat financial year, the revenue amounted to Ks. 10,69,600 and the expenditure to lis. 10,60,250 showing the very small surplus of Rs. 9 ,350 on the year's working. With the opening balance of Rs. 3,25,800 the state has therefore on the 1st October 1921 a balance of Bs. 3,35,150 in its treasury. In the budget revenue had been estimated at Es. 14,22,000 and expenditure at Rs. 11,61,480. The fall in revenue was almost entirely due to the world wide trade slump combined with the fall ir silver which adversely affected the purchasing power of the dollar. Trade during tho months of Pebruary and March almost ceased. Though the customs revenue from the ports of Muscat and Muttrah fell off considerably in comparison with last year, the administration of the customs greatly improved as is shown by the figures for the customs revenues from outside ports which were Rs. 1,73,300 during the year under report as compared with Rs. 95,165 in the previous year, while Rs. 48,700 were realised from the Gwadur customs which were brought under the Muscat central customs control in March. The chief items in expenditure during the financial year were Rs. 93,480 representing two instalments towards the repayment of the loan from the British Government, Rs. 1,18,146 for the Levy Corps, and Es. 76,272 for the purchase of motor boats. Due to the financial stringency it was necessary to reduce expenditure as far as possible, and the Political Agent was compelled more than once to urge the importance of strict financial control and of careful supervision of establishment upon the Council of Ministers. To meet the serious financial situation His Highness' privy purse of Rs. 10,000 per mensem was reduced for three months to Rs. 5,000 per mensem. For the next financial year revenue is estimated at Rs. 10,95,400 and expenditure at Rs, 10,00,000. Eor the three months 1st October to 31st December 1921 the revenue was Rs. 3,05,175 and the expenditure Rs, 3,12 ,296, the latter including a third repayment of Rs. 46,740 towards the loan. (&lt;?) Defence. The project of providing the Sultan's government with an efficient force for the protection of Muscat and Muthrah, and for the maintenance of his authority on the coast had been mooted as long ago as 1911, and had been reaffirmed by the Government of India as one of the conditions nf the loan granted in 1918. In 1920 the scheme was seriously taken in hand, but as described in the last report, was held up owing to the provision in the Arms Traffic Convention placing Muscat within the prohibited area. The adhesion of the Sultan to the Arms Traffic Convention at the beginning of the year removed this final difficulty, and the disbandment of the Sistan levies provided a suitable moment and field for recruitment. On the 19th April a force of 250 men of all ranks, all recruited from the Sistan levies and under thu command of Captain E. D. McCarthy, a former66 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE Sistan Levy officer arrived in Muscat from Sistan via Karachi. For the first two months of their stay they were cantonned in Watayah, about four miles from Balt-al Falaj, and on the departure of the 2-35th Sikhs on the 28th June moved into the detachment's quarters at the latter place. The Levy Corps has been the very greatest success. The men are well disciplined and adequately supplied with machine guns. They have adapted themselves to their surroundings and their health has on the whole been good. The interior economy of the corps is admirable. During the last three months of the year an attempt, which proved remarkably successful, was made to recruit the local Arab or Baluch as replace ments. Some sixty have now been enrolled, and so promising are they that it is hoped gradually to replace the Sistanis by an entirely local force. The very greatest credit is due to the Commandant of the Levy Corps, Captain McCarthy, whose personal leadership, energy and power of organisa tion have achieved the seemingly impossible. As regards His Majesty's Government, the arrival of the Levy Corps as a Muscat State force has enabled the withdrawal of the detachment of Indian troops which was never less tban 400 rifles and was often much more, with their accompanying hospital and transport personnel which had been in Oman since 1913, and has so saved Government an expenditure of many lakhs a year which was being incurred in keeping an independent ruler on his throne. During the year a large seagoing motor boat and a harbour motor boat which had been ordered last year by the Muscat Government from Messrs. Herman in Karachi arrived. They have proved exceedingly useful, and have been put in charge of the Commandant of the Le^y Corps. Detachments of the Levy Corps visited Khasab and Masnaah, and this visible sign of the strength of the Muscat Government has been of great value. {d) Miscellaneous. The town of Gwadur, the Sultan's possession On the Mekran coast, and which had previously been administered by him as a private estate, was in March brought under the control of the Council of Ministers and its revenues credited to the central treasury at Muscat. The Customs administration has been successful, but there have been a considerable number of complaints from merchants «s to the absence of security in the town. The lawlessness of Mekran and the severe famine are probably more responsible for this state of affairs than the Muscat administration. The Council of Ministers were unfortunately unable to make arrangements during the year for taking over the direct administration of the province of Sohar, which continued to be administered semi-independently by Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal. It is to be hoped that they will be able to do this at an early date, as the revenue to be derived from Sohar is considerable. The administration of justice in the hands of Sheikh Zubeir continued satisfactory. No attempt was however made to advance education. The departure of Abdul Salam Effendi Ghanem, the Director of Customs, for Egypt on the termination of his contract with the Muscat Government, had been a considerable blow to the administration. His great powers of organiza tion and his remarkable energy were invaluable. It is very largely due to him directly that the finances of the state have shown such improvement. His place has been taken by Saiyid Abu Salih, an Indian who has been long in the service of the state. Arms Traffic. There has been no arms traffic. No purchases were made from the Arms Warehouse. British Subjects and British Interests. 290 British subjects were registered during the year of whom 133 were from Gwadur. The total amount of fees collected including fines was Rs. 391.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. B ritish T roops. 57 The 1-117th Mahrattas were relieved 20th January. The latter left for India on been no British troops in Oman. by the 2-35th Sikhs from India on 28th June, since when there have S lave T rade. A somewhat alarming increase in the slave trade occurred during the year, in the form of the running of Baluchis in dhows from the Mekran coast to such places as Dibba and Kalba to the north of the Batinah coast, from whence they were taken by land to Trucial Oman and sold. The Sultan's Government, especially in Sohar, displayed considerable diligence in hunting out the slaves and slave runners when they entered their jurisdiction, and the Omani chiefs also co-operated. The slave runners made the country round Khor fakkan which is outside the Sultan's territory their chief landing place, and there is no doubt that Baraimi and Trucial Oman are the chief markets. The general lawlessness in Mekran and the uncontrolled power of the sardars, combined with an unprecedented famine accounted for this state of affairs. The sardars make a large income by shipping slaves, and many Baluchis driven by the famine to the Arabian coast in search of work are decoyed into the interior. A contributory cause was the long absence of His Majesty's ships from the Gulf of Oman. Their more frequent appearance in the latter half of the year had an excellent effect. 47 slaves took refuge in the Consulate of whom 38 were manumitted. T rade. The price of dollars fell somewhat during the year due to the low price of silver. The average monthly rates were January 192 per 100 dollars. February March April May June July August Sepfembe October .

The slump in trade and the fall in prices to which reference was made in last year's report were very severely felt during the year under report. An effort was made by importers to keep the price of rice artificially high to cover their losses. Prices on the whole showed a downward tendency. Trade in Muscat itself is however decreasing as the port no longer exists as a distri buting centre for anywhere except Oman. The date harvest was scarcely up to the average. P rench I nterests. The French Coal Dep6t was leased by His Majesty's Government throughout the year. Towards the end of the year the French Government renounced their rights in it to His Highness the Sultan who thereupon re-granted the use of the site to the British Government. Q58 administration report of The Monsieur Ibrahim Elbaz, the only French subject, who was supposed to have left Muscat for good, suddenly returned in June and immediately became involved in a succession of disputes with the Saltan's Governmeat and with British subjects. The fact that French interests are in charge of +he French Consul at Bombay, who alone therefore can deal with M. Elbaz, makes settle ment a somewhat difficult matter. American Mission. The Eev. G Van Peursem of the American Arabian Mission left for Sur, Balhat, Daghmarand and Quryat and returned on the % i6th January. Miss Lutton left for India en route to Australia on 9th March. Dr. Hodman left for India on 19th May and returned on 29th August. Climate and Health. In the first half of the year malaria and bronchitis raged with unabated vigour and the season was universally spoken of as the most unhealthy within memory. In September an epidemic of cholera broke out both at Muscat and Muttra and lasted till the middle of October. The total number of cases were I4i4i with 94 deaths. Navy.

Khan Sahib Isa bin Abdul Latif held charge of the post of Residency General. Agent on the Trucial Coast throughout the year. He continued to do good work and rendered, valuable assistance showing considerable tact in restoring peace on the Trucial Coast on the several occasions when fighting occurred during the year. As a result of the war, anti-British propaganda, and the agitation in India respect for the British Government had diminished on the Trucial Coast, especially among the minor Sheikhs and drastic action had to be taken in one or two cases. In one case bombardment became necessary, whereas in pre-war days the mere threat and the appearance of one of His Maiesty's Ships would have been sufficient. The Government of India having concurred in the proposal made by the Shargah. Resident to fine the Sheikh of Sharga £ , oeiAN ■^ s - 12,000 {vide administration report for 19i0) arrangements were made with the Senior Naval Officer for H. M. S. 'Cyclamen' and H. M. Crocus 'to be present at Shargali when the Resident visited that place on the 7th May. On arrival of the Resident at Shargah in H. M. S. ' Cyclamen ' the Sheikh came off to the ship and was informed that the Government of India had decided that his behaviour in December 1920 could not be overlooked and that he should be fined Rs. 12,000. The Sheikh expressed contrition and apologized for his conduct and asked that the fine or a portion of it should be remitted. The Resident informed him that it was too late and that he must pay the full amount. Sheikh Khalid promised to do this before 10 a. m . the next day and was very humble and apologetic, so the Resident told him nnally that m view of his contrition he would recommend to Government that Rs. ^000 out of the fine^ should be utilized as the second instalment of the claim of Kisu bin Jhita which was due shortly, and this was subsequentlv sanctioned by the Government of India. Sheikh Khalid then went ashore and returned at once with the fine of Rs. 12,000 in cash. Nothing of any importance occurred^ in the Sheikhdoms of Debai, Abu Debai, Abu Dhabi and Umm-ui-Qaiwain. Dhabi and Umm-ul -QaiwaiD during the year. On the 9th May the Political Resident visited Ajman in H. M. S. ' Cycla- Ajman. ^ ' accompanied by H. M. S. ' Crocus' , ....

When on the Trucial Coast in December 1920 the Resident's attention was drawn to the fact that Sheikh Humaid had torn up a manumission certi- ficate granted by the Residency in 1917, and had tried to re-enslave the holder which obviously was a most serious offence. The Resident accordingly visited Ajman m R. I. M S.

Several Ion'- conferences then ensued on board between Sheikh Sultan and the Sheikh of the Shihuh which culminated in a verbal agreement between the two parties whereby the two brothers were to be removed from Rams and handed over to the Sheikh of Shargah for safe custody pending further instructions, and a 6 months' truce was established during which the issues at stake between the Shihuh and the Sheikh of Ras-el-Mhaimah were to be submitted for arbitration to the Resident, and meanwhile a man of Sheikh Sultan's own choosing was to be installed as headman of Rams. No further trouble occurred during the remainder of the year . A. P. TREVOR, L IEUT.- C OL., Folitical Resident in the Persian Gulf. bushihe, 9a May 1922. XI—12862 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CHAPTER X. Administration Report cf the Political Agency, Bahrain, for the year 1921. 1. Personnel. Charge of the Political Agency was held by the Indian Assistant Khan Sahib Syed Siddiq Hassan until January 20tli, when charge was taken over by Major C. K. Daly, the present incumbent. The Indian Assistant proceeded on leave in May, and has since been transferred, the Political Agent being in charge of the duties in addition to his own. 2. The Ruler of Bahrain and Al Khalifbh family. In the latter part of 1920 relations with Shaik Sir Easa Bin Ali had become extremely difficult and although they have, to some extent, since improved, are still unsatisfactory for the following reasons. Apart from feebleness due to his advanced age, Shaik Sir Easa Bin Ali is a weak character entirely dominated by his wife, the mother of his youngest son, Shaik Abdulla. It is this lady's ambition that her son should succeed to the Rulership instead of the recognised heir, Shaik Hamad-bin-Easa, C.S.I., who is the eldest son, but by another wife. Shaik Abdulla since his return from England in 1919 had made himself virtually ruler of Bahrain; a position which he abused to an incredible extent. Oppression of Bahrain subjects which had been steadily on the increase, reached its height early in the year, under bis regime. Political murders were becoming common, while his administration was so corrupt that there was no security for persons or property. Outrages against respectable women by Shaik Abdulla and other members of Al Khalifeh family were becoming of very frequent occurrence. Indignation at this state of affairs was so great that disturbances appeared imminent, and it became obvious that if they were to be avoided, the removal of Shaik Abdulla from the manage ment of affairs was necessary. Shaik Abdulla was sufficiently astute to realise that his position was untenable, and consented to retire from public affairs, rather than risk disturbances which would inevitably lead to his downfall. With Shaik Sir Easa bin Ali's consent, Shaik Hamad took the manage ment of public business on his behalf. Eor a short time oppression decreased and there was a general improvement. It soon became evident that Shaik Abdulla and his mother had no intention of accepting a position in which the former was subordinate to his elder brother, and was losing his tyrannical hold over the inhabitants. They have therefore employed every means in their power, including intrigues, bribery, intimidation and propaganda to undermine Shaik Hamad's authority, and to stir up opposition and enmity towards the Agency, believing that without the moral support of the Political Agent, Shaik Hamad would be unable to retain his position. The latter although very desirous of effecting some highly necessary reforms, and establishing elementary justice, has found himself hindered at every step by his aged father, Shaik Easa whose opposition has been aroused and deliberately cultivated by Shaik Abdulla for his own ends. With the position as it is, the death of Shaik Easa would give rise to a severe struggle for supremacy and during his lifetime little amelioration of the situation can be expected unless some means can be devised of curbing Shaik Abdulia's ambitions and activities. The situation has been reported in detail and is under the consideration of Government.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 63 3. Bahrain Trade. Trade has, in general, been very depressed, mainly as the result of the fall in the pearl market, upon which the prosperity of Bahrain almost entirely depends. A great deal of bankruptcy and distress has resulted among the smaller traders. 4. S hipping. During the latter part of the year mail steamers have called regularly, but during the first six months the Down Mails were so irregular as to cause serious inconvenience and dislocation of trade. 5. J udicial. (A) There has been a great increase of case work during the year under review. Civil suits disposed of 777. Criminal cases 281, several of which were of an extremely complicated nature and had been in progress for a year or more. (B) The Joint Court consisting of the Political Agent and Shaik Hamad has settled satisfactorily a large number of cases, though many have been unnecessarily complicated by Shaik Abdulla's interference and his endeavours to obstruct the course of justice, to bring Shaik Hamad into ill repute. (C) The Salifeh Court deals with pearl-diving cases and consists of a single venal judge, himself a pearl merchant and in the pay of the other merchants. It has become so corrupt that no justice whatever can be expected from it and divers, the majority of whom are British protected subjects, prefer to drop their cases rather than have them referred to this court, the decisions of which are always a foregone conclusion. By the terms of the Bahrain Order in Council this court should be composed of two or more members appointed jointly by the ruler and the Political Agent in consultation. No attempt to put right the glaring abuses of the diving laws, practised by employers, could be made in the present political situation, as it would be strongly opposed by the wealthy pearling community, and taken advantage of by Shaik Abdulla as an opportunity to stir up trouble' for his own ends. Nevertheless the position is one damaging to the prestige of His ^ Britannic Majesty's Agency, inasmuch as the divers, who are mostly under its protection, are unable to obtain any sort of justice. Oppression in the diving trade in Bahrain has of late years greatly exceeded that of any of the other pearling centres in the Gulf. It is hoped that it will be possible to take steps to deal with this situation during the ensuing year, should a favourable opportunity occur. 6. Municipality. The Municipality initiated in Manameh in 1920 has in the past yea* effected a very great improvement in the sanitation of the town. An improve ment in the public health is believed to be noticeable, and the fact that Bahrain has now been free of plague for an unusually long period, is attributed by many to the improvements. The Municipality was, in the early part of the year, under the ban of popular disapproval owing to the tactless behaviour and dishonest methods of an Indian who held the position of Secretary. On his dismissal Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif, a wealthy and enlightened Persian, was induced to accept the post in an honorary capacity. This gentleman has effected very considerable improvements, and the Municipality is now deservedly in favour with all classes. A Municipality has also been started in the town of Maharraq, but it is inefficiently managed. A movement is on foot headed by some of the notables to enlist the support of the Political Agent with a view to its being put on a sounder basis, but this, like every other reform in Bahrain, depends upon the political relations between members of the ruling family. 7. Climate. The rainfall during 1921 was decidedly below the average. The fortv days 4 Shamar or northerly wind, which usually somewhat alleviates the hot64 administration report of the weather was a complete failure; the season therefore constituted the hottest and most unpleasant known for many years. 8. Medical. The popularity of the Victoria Memorial Hospital appears to have decreased considerably during the last few ^ s w reports, is considered to compare very unfavourably with that of the |™® ri0 Mission hospital, which has during the year treated above ten thousand., including 503 major 313 minor and operations. There is a great demand for n -i 1 'o ^ 1 4 ^ o 1 o vfto includms: 5Ud maior oio miiiui „ 0 . further medical work in Bahrain since a large proportion of cases taken m the Mission hospital are from the mainland and they cannot deal with a large number oHess imrwrtant ca^es in Bahrain. The Political Agent has been anOToachedby many of the local notables including the Qadhi with aviewto swrnrin' more modern and energetic administration of the Victoria Mcmona 1 Hospital which they would appreciate as being free from religious considera tions. This appears very desirable, since the American doctor is frequently absent from Bahrain during which periods the Mission hospital is closed. 9. The Sultan op Najd. Was enaaeed throughout the year in hostilities with his hereditary enemy BinEashid, rafer of Hail, which place he eventually captured after a protracted siege which was brought to a close mamly by financial tactics. Much friendly correspondence has passed with the Sultan, as'has also been the case with Bin Jiluwi, Amir of Hassa. The latter is most businesslike and prompt in settling claims against his subjects, an unusual attribute in an Arab ruler. 10. Marine Survey. KIMS ' Palinurus' carried out a survey of the harbours of Qatif, Bas Tanureh and a part of Jubail, with a view to discovering their possibilities Ltfwfhp nrovmce of Hassa. These places were found to be unsuitable as ports for large vessels of the British India type, which the Sultan of Najd desired should make them ports of call. 11. Visits. The Political Resident visited twice during the year. The S. N. 0. visited twice. 12. Local Honours. On the occasion of His Majesty's birthday Shaik Hamad bin Easa was granted the C. S. I. Abdul Aziz Qosaibi, Khan Bahadur. Abdur Rahman Ziyani Khan Sahib. 13. The Pbarl Fisheries. The Political Agent toured round the pearling fleets in July. The season was an average one, but merchants who also held large stocks from the previous year were unable to dispose of much stock owing to the fall in price» m Bombay and Europe. 14. Bepresentations by Bahraini Shiahs. On the occasion of the Political Resident's visit in December, a large deputation of Bahrainis waited on him and made formal complaints of the oppression referred to in paragraph 2 above. C.K.DALY, Major , I. A., Political Agent Bahrain.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. m CHAPTER XI. Administration Report of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1921. Personnel. The charge of the Agency was held by Major J. C. More, D. S. 0., throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon* E. M. Cuzen, I. M. D., arrived from India on 25th February and took over the medical charge of the Agency and the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer from that date. Prior to his arrival these duties had been performed by Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, O. B. E., of the American Mission until his departure for America on the 28th January, and subsequently by Dr. (Mrs.) Calverley and Dr. (Miss) Wakefield. The Euler of Kuwait. Shaikh Salim al-Mubarak was seized with a sudden illness at Jahrah on the 22nd Pebruary; he was brought into Kuwait by boat on the 2ord } but died the same night. On the 24th Eebruary a representative body of the leading townsmen called on the members of the Subah family, and intimated to them that they were willing to accept as Euler of Kuwait Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir, Shaikh 'Abdullah as-Salim or Shaikh Hamad al-Mubarak, as the family might decide, but that they wished in future to have some say in the government, in the form of a small elective council. To this the Subah family agreed, and it was decided that Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir, who was then in Najd, should be acclaimed Euler on his return, provided that he too agreed to this condition: Shaikh Ahmad arrived in Kuwait on the 24th March, and was accepted as the new Euler of Kuwait by the Subah family the same day ; and on the 25th a meeting of the leading notables was called, who also accepted him, his tactful speech having made a very favourable impression. He made an agreement with the people to the effect that• (1) Criminal cases would be decided only in accordance with the Shar'. (2) In the event of appeal, the written statements of both parties and the Qadhi's judgment would be submitted to the 'Ulama, whose decision would be final. (3) If both parties in a dispute agreed beforehand to accept the arbitration of a third party, his decision would hold. (4) The Euler would consult his people in all matters affecting the town, both internal and external. (5) If anyone had any suggestion to make for the benefit of the town or people, he would lay it before the Euler, who would consult his people and, if they approved, would adopt the proposal. A Council of Advisers, consisting of twelve members, was subsequently elected, but no times were fixed for it to meet, the intention being that it should only do so when the Shaikh wished to discuss any matter with it, or when the townspeople wished to lay any matter before him ; and, in practice, the present Shaikh rules in practically the same manner as his predecessors. Condition of the Country. The country was most unsettled at the beginning of the year owing to the quarrel between the Shaikh of Kuwait and Ibn Sa'ud. There were constant alarmist rumours that the Ikhwan were going to attack Jahrah again, or even Kuwait, and a great feeling of insecurity prevailed. On the 21st January a66 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE party of Ikhwan horsemen, about fifty strong, raided a small camp of local Arabs near Shu'aibah, and subsequently other small camps scattered between there and Jahrah. None of these was strong enough to make any resistance, and the tribesmen took refuge in Kuwait and Jahrah. In the evening a party of about a hundred turned out from Jahrah and drove off the raiders, who however got away with the spoil w T hich they had taken. In the meanwhile Shaikh Sir Khaz'al Khan, G.C.I E., of Muhammerah offered to send his son Shaikh Chasib to Najd, accompanied by Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir, to try and improve the relations between Ibn Sa'ud and the Shaikh of Kuwait. Sis offer was accepted, and the Mission left Kuwait for Bahrain en route for Najd on the 8th February. Ibn Sa'ad received the Mission at Hafar al-'Akk on the 2nd March. Two days later news of Shaikh Salim's death arrived there, and Ibn Sa'ud at once said that the two houses of Sa'ad and Subah were once again united in perfect friendship, as he had never had any quarrel with anyone in Kuwait except Shaikh Salim, who had forced it on him. He at once sent notifications throughout his dominions proclaiming peace with Kuwait. Since then relations between Ibn Sa'ud and Shaikh Ahmad have remained most friendly, and Kuwait has greatly benefitted by the resumption of trade with Najd. On the 26th July a party of six 'Ajman Ikhwan raided some Shammar Tauqah families at Eumailah, near Zubair, killing two men and carrying off a number of sheep and donkeys, etc. On being informed, the Shaikh of Kuwait at once issued orders for the raiders to be intercepted at Jahrah if possible, with the result that 286 sheep, 27 donkeys, one mare and two rifles were recovered and two of the raiders were captured. On the 7th August a party of Dhafir raided near Jahrah, and carried off 64 camels belonging to Kuwait Bedouin and about double that number belong ing to Ibn Sa'ud's subjects. A counter raid on the Dhafir was then carried out by the Ikhwan at Khanaqah, and a considerable number of camels were seized. On the 3rd September a party of Dhafir, and Shammar who had taken refuge in 'Iraq territory, raided Shu'aib, eight hours west o? Jahrah, and captured four herds of camels. On the 16th September there was another raid at Umm Kuwaisat in the Shiqaq district, about 35 miles north-west by north of Jahrah, in which seven herds of Kuwait camels were captured. On the 20th October a large party of Dhafir, under : Abdur Eazzaq son of Ibn Hallaf shaikh of the Sa'id section of the tribe, raided Zaqlah, six miles north-west of Jahrah, and captured eight herds of camels. Fifteen of the Shaikh of Kuwait's followers pursued the raiders from Jahrah, and came up with them in the tract of country known as Yah, about 18 miles north of Jahrah. They, however, found themselves very much outnumbered and lost one man and seven horses killed without recovering anything. In addition to the above, there were a few other minor raids from 'Iraq territory against the Shaikh of Kuwait's subjects, and others against Ibn Sa'ud's, but since October these have ceased. At first some bitterness was felt by the Shaikh of Kuwait at the frequency of these raids from 'Iraq territory, but he now appears to be quite satisfied with the action which has been taken, a portion of the looted property having been recovered, the stipend of Shaikh Hamud as-Suwait of the Dhafir having been suspended, and Ibn Hallaf, who was one of the chief offenders, having been detained and prevented from further activities. The most interesting event in the Interior during the year was Ibn Sa'ud's campaign against Hail, In a letter dated 10th April Ibn Sa ud informed the Shaikh of Kuwait that he had sent out his brother Muhammad and his sons Sa'ud and Eaisal, each with a force, against the Shammar. The first two were to leave the Jabal Shammar on their left' and attack the Shammar in the north, while Paisal was to leave the Jabal Shammar on his right and attack its villages from that side. He said that Muhammad hadPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 6? ^proceeded via Khadhra and attacked the inhabitants of HaiyanijAh ; he had then turned south aud defeated Ibn Rashid's force at Sakhariyat, killing 300; the enemy had retired to Hail, and Muhammad had encamped at Yatib! Eaisal had gone to Shu'aibah and made various attacks from there. In another letter, dated four days later, he informed Shaikh Ahmad that Sa'ud had advanced against Ibn Talal at Qaisumah ; he, however, had not awaited his attack, but had retired and split up his force; Sa'ud had followed and defeated one portion at Burait. These Shammar had all surrendered, and Ibn Sa'ud had ordered them to encamp near the Tawal adh-Dhafir so as to be well away from Hail. He said that his force was camping between Lainah and Kharisah, where^ there was good grazing, with the object of investing Hail, all the villages of Jabal Shammar having surrendered. The blockade of Hail continued without any marked result till August; it was not very close, however, and a certain amount of foodstuffs were got into the town. In a letter, dated 6th August, Ibn Sa'ud informed the Shaikh of Kuwait that he was shortly starting for Shu'aibah, north-east of Hail, with a large force of Ikhwan, to personally conduct the siege of Hail. Writing to the Political Agent on the 4th September, he said that Faisal ad-Dawish was at Jathamiyah, ten miles north of Hail, facing Ibn Talal, who was at Namsiyah, a few miles distant. Ibn Talal apparently did not know^ that he (Ibn Sa'ud) was advancing against him, and he hoped to surprise him. In a subsequent letter, dated I4th September, Ibn Sa'ud informed the Political Agent that Paisal ad-Hawish and Ibn Talal had fought an engage ment on the 7th September, in which the latter was defeated and lost 200 killed. He himself had joined Paisal ad-Dawish at Jathamiyah on the 8th and had ordered a general attack on the morning of the 9th. The enemy had broken as soon as his artillery opened fire, and had split into two parties, one of which made for Hail and the other took refuge in some forts. Ibn Sa'ud's force had pursued the former right up to the town, and had shelled the other party out of the forts and captured all their munitions, including three guns and three machine guns. He estimated that the enemy had lost 500 killed in the two days 'fighting. Ibn Talal had sued for peace, but he had demanded his unconditional surrender and the evacuation of the town, and had not yet received his reply. In the above letter Ibn Sa'ud made no mention of his own casualties, but from subsequent reports it appears that they were extremely heavy; in fact, the fighting appears to have resulted in a reverse for Ibn Sa'ud, rather than the signal victory which he claimed. In a letter, dated the 3rd November, Ibn Sa'ud informed the Political Agent that the people of Hail had again sued for peace and had accepted all his terms, and that the town was in his hands with all its defences and garrison, as also were Ibn Talal and the rest of the Eashid family. Ibn Sa'ud appointed Ibrahim bin Salim as-Subhan Governor of Hail on his behalf, and himself returned to Riyadh, taking Ibn Talal and some other members of the Rashid family with him. The Boundaries of Kuwait. The question of the boundary between Kuwait and Najd was one of the chief causes of the quarrel between the late Shaikh Salim and Ibn Sa'ud, the former claiming a frontier which started from the south side of the Khor az-Zubair at its junction with the Khor 'Abdullah, and passed iust to the south of Umm Qasr, Safwan and Jabal Sanam, and westward to the Batin • then south-west along the Batin to Hafar al-Batin; then south-east so as to include the wells of Safah, Qar'ah, Habah, and Wabrah, and the village of Anta ; and thence eastwards to the coast. Ibn Sa'ud on the other hand claimed the whole country up to the walls of Kuwait, all of which, he said . . belonged to his grandfather and great-grandfather before the temporary intrusion of the Turks. In 1920 both parties had asked His Majesty's Government to arbitrate m the matter, but it had been impossible to arrange a meeting between the two rulers.6 0g ADMINISTRATION REPOET OF THE On the 15th February His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq wrote to Ibn Sa'iid informing him that His Majesty's Government recognised the area, the boundary of which forms a semi-circle with the town of Kuwait as centre and the Khor az-Zubair on its radius to the north and Qurain to the south, as definitely belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait, his autonomy having been recognised within this area by the Anglo-Turkish Agreement which was signed on the 29th July 1913 but never ratified. To this Ibn Ba'ud has agreed. The territory between this line and the frontier claimed by the Shaikh of Kuwait, however, is still undecided and subject to negotiations between the parties and His Majesty's Government. Arms Teattic. Although the arms traffic is now kept within modest bounds by the activity of His Majesty's ships, a certain number of rifles and ammunition are still smuggled across to the smaller ports on the Persian coast between the Shatt al-'Arab and Lingah, hidden in the general cargo of sailing boats. In recent years arms have mostly reached Kuwait via Hail and it is probable that the supply w r ill now be considerably curtailed, as it is Ibn Sa'ad's policy to hold up as many arms as possible for his own use. Customs Administration. Khan Sahib * Abdul Latif has continued , to manage the Shaikh's Customs throughout the year, and the system has worked satisfactorily. Shaikh Ahmad, like his predecessor, persists in levying customs dues on goods manifested for, but not landed at Kuwait. Postal. With effect from the 1st August the Kuwait Post Office was transferred to the -Iraq Postal Department, and 'Iraq postal rates and regulations were brought into force. The change is most unpopular in Kuwait, owing to the enormous increase of the rates of postage, and also to the loss temporary, however, it is hoped-of facilities, such as the Value Payable Postage system and Telegraphic Money Orders, which it had enjoyed as an Indian Post Office. There has been a weekly service of mail steamers from India throughout the year, and a fortnightly service from Basrah. To supplement the latter, mails are also sent from Basrah to Pao as opportunity offers, and are brought from there in water boats by a special postman entertained for the purpose. Water Plant, Mr. G. B. Pratt, representing Messrs. Scott &amp; Co., London, arrived in Kuwait on the 20th September, in connection with the Water Plant erected by Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co., Muhammerah, and remained till the end of the year carrying out extensive alterations to the Plant, which, it is now hoped, will be in working order by the end of March 1922. Pearl Fishery. About 320 Kuwait pearling boats visited the pearl banks. The season, » however, was a bad one, both as regards the catch and the price of pearls. Some of the leading merchants have not yet disposed of their 1920 pearls. Considerable nervousness is felt amongst the pearl merchants regarding the Japanese 'culture ' pearl trade. Medical. The Agency Charitable Dispensary re-opened on the 23rd May, on the receipt of the necessary medical stores from India, after having been closed since 1st September 1918. Prom the above date to the close of the year 5,375 out-patients were treated, including 1,212 women and 1,398 children. The daily attendance has been unprecedented, the proportion being in the ratio ofv PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. 69 45 to 10 of previous years, doubtless in part due to the fact that there was no qualified medical man in charge of the men's hospital of the American Mission. In addition to the above, the Assistant Surgeon paid an average of 20 professional visits a month to patients at their own homes. On the men's side of the American Mission Hospital 2,184 out-patients were treated, 58 patients were admitted to hospital and 126 professional visits were made to patients in their homes. On the Women's side 2,268 out-patients were treated, 34 were admitted to hospital, and 251 were treated in their homes. Though the Arabs are slowly beginning to appreciate Western methods of treatment, there is still much to be desired. Except for the merchant class who travel, and who realise the beneficial effects of early treatment, the majority still cling tenaciously to their own crude methods, such as branding with red hot irons, blood letting with razors, etc., which they consider a panacea for all ailments, and when these fail they come to the dispensary and expect miraculous results with one bottle of medicine. The diseases most prevalent in the town during 1921 were :— (a) Those of the digestive system, due to voracious eating. (d) Granular conjunctivitis, due to defective sanitary conditions; this causes a high percentage of blindness, the people only coming for treatment after the disease has worked its havoc. (c) Tuberculosis, due to ill-ventilated rooms and the lip-to-lip and mouth-to-mouth system of drinking and eating. Measles, small-pox and whooping cough have been in epidemic form almost throughout the year, and have accounted for a very high infantile mortality. The people have faith in vaccination, but the results have not proved satisfactory, as, owing to the distance, lymph received from India is inert. In June Basrah and Muhammerah were declared plague infected, and the following orders for quarantine were issued, and worked satisfactorily :— (a) No one was to board any vessel from either port until it had been inspected by the Quarantine Medical Officer. (If) Passengers by steamer from either port to be quarantined in a special sailing boat, provided for the purpose in front of the Customs House until released by the Quarantine Medical Officer. (c) Sailing boats from either port to be themselves similarly quarantined. (d) No water boat was to carry passengers. Has al-Ardh Beacon. The beacon at Ras al-Ardh collapsed on the 10th October. On the following day a mast was erected on tbe debris of the beacon, 30 feet above the ground with a wooden disk 5 feet in diameter at the top, to serve as a temporary landmark for ships b^ day. At night the lamp is now placed on the roof of the caretaker's house, thirty-five yards to the south of the beacon. Naval and Marine. The following ships of His Majesty's Navy and of the Royal Indian Marine visited Kuwait during the year :— R.I.M.S. Lawrence arrived on 8th January and left the same day. H.M.S. Triad arrived on 9th March and left on 11th March. R.I.M.S. Nearchus arrived on 24th April and left on 26th April. H.M.S. Cyclamen arrived on 15th May and left on 22nd May. H.M.S. Crocus arrived on 24th June and left on 28th June. R.I.M.S. Lawrence arrived on 15th August and left the same day. R.I.M.S. Nearchus arrived on 24th September and left the same day. H.M.S. Benown arrived on 3rd December and left on 11th December.70 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921. Education. During the summer months a subscription was raised to endow a Muslim school, which would afford a better education than that offered in the ordinary Mullas' schools, and a sum of Es. 10,0 JO a year was subscribed. In September the new school, called the madrasat al-Ahmadiyah, was accordingly opened. Owing to lack of funds it has not been able to provide very efficient masters, but it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Labour. The price of labour remained high during the year, an ordinary coolie earning from Es. 3 to Es. 4 a day, carpenters, from Es. 5 to Es 9 a day with food, or from Es. 7 to Es. 9 without; masons and boat-builders, from Es. 8 to Es. 10 with food, or from Es. 10 to Es. 12 without. Exchange. The rate of exchange of Maria Theresa dollars varied from Es. 205 to Es. 168-12-9 per cent, being highest at the beginning of the year, and lowest at the end of April; at the close of the year it was Es. 181 per cent. British sovereigns rose from Es. 16-10-0 in January to lis. 19-7-0 in July; at the end of the year they were at Es. 17-12-0. Turkish pounds rose from Es. 14-12-0 at the beginning of January to Es. 17-6-6 in July; at the end of the year their rate was Es. 15-12-0. J. C.

Tampakoff arrived at Shiraz on 24th May accompained by tlirGe Socretaries as Hussiaa Soviet Consul. He established relations with the British Consul by calling on him shortly after his arrival in Shiraz. This Bolshevik invasion was regarded with some what mixed feelings in Shiraz ; the younger Democrats were prepared to give them a warm welcome, the other Democrats and politicians generally, though more guarded in their views, were sympathetic and hopeful especially as it was humoured that the Russians had large sums of money for propaganda purpose^ and they scented the possibility of some gain : the laiidowners and othef notables were genuinely apprehensive at what they considered a threat to their own interests. The Russian Consul ably assisted by his Munshi Mirza Abdul Karim— formerly editor of the pro-Bolshevik paper ' Haqiqat' and one time employ^ of the Einance Department in Bushire whence he had been removed by the British during the war—began his campaign actively enough by the establishment of relations with the Democrats. But shortage of funds soon hampered his progress and discouraged his supporters although he lost no op portunity to preach the doctrine of communism, highly unpalatable though it might be to the officials and landowners of Ears. The breaking off of relations between the Russian and Persian Governments at the close of the year reduced any influence he might have had left to vanishing point. j&amp;riiisn Troops*—The 9th Bhopal Infantry, under the Command of Colonel H. H. Smith, D.S.O., arrived at Bushire on the 23rd February in relief of the 2-112th Infantry and remained for the rest of the year. Local Government. —H. E.

During his tenure of Office at Bushire lie was consis- tently friendly towards the British, and relations between His Excellenov anrl tne Residency and Military Officers were very cordial. Yamin-ul-Mamalik, who was Karguzar throughout the year, officiated n«s Governor, after the departure of Mushar-ed-Dowleh, till the end of the year?* * He has since been confirmed. Spring Under instructions ^ received from the Persian Government (probably m answer to a suggestion emanating from himself), he visited Dasht- i^Siir m order to inspect and report on the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in that area. He returned from his tour—on which he was accom panied by two of the Company's Officials—evidently impressed by the amount ot work which the Company is putting in and the extent to which Persian labour is benefiting. At the end of March the Karguzar again left Bushirp on a round tour of the ports of the Persian side of Ihe Gulf in the ' Persenolis' if lasted till the end of the hot weather. It is doubtful whether anvtliino- resulted from this tour, which was quite unprecedented for a Karguzar excenfc numerous complaints against the Karguzar of oppressing Officials and Mer- cnants m the various ports he visited : one account even going so far as to allege that his exactions had reached the sum of 100,000 Tomans. This wfw doubtless an exaggeration. as 1. Fars, Shir a z and the Tribes. . , .^ e ® leme n ts of the situation in Ears which had made for a cprfcain stability during 1921, were unhappily disturbed at the end of that year bv thp disbandment of the South Persia Rifles The presence of this force had dven great moral support to the united efforts of his Imperial Highness Nasrat-as- feultaneh, the Governor-General, and His Excellency the'Qawam-ul-Mulk towards a strong local Government, at once friendly to the British and camble of preserving order in Pars : and the removal of this prop had the imraediatelv 'weakening effect which was anticipated in last year's report. The Press already Very anti-British in tone, became at once more violent than ever and attacked the Consulate and British interests in Persia with a bitterness which the Governor-General seemed unable to check. Notwithstand- ing protests from Teheran that this campaign was injuring relations with the British Government; and although early in March he was armed with special powers for dealing with the Press, the Governor-General seemed too timid to make an effective protest. At the same time his weakness in other directions was encouraging the rise of elements calculated to disturh public security, such as the Jandullah, bands of men, many of them bullies, whose activities in the past had led to serious disorders, and which now tbreafened to displace the varwus democrat parties. It was natural that the Central Government siiould take advantage of these circumstances to extend its authority in Pars and encroach on the purely departmental powers entrusted to its Governor- General who was driven on the 13th April to send his Deputy Teheran to protest against this interference and endeavour to get assurances from the Pnme Minister that it would cease. But while resenting interference. His mperial Highness Nasrat- as-Saltaneh was incapable of managing affairs without the assistance of ti.e Central Government. The old quarrel between His Exce.lency the Qawam-ul-Mulk and the Soulet dragged on, and was undoubted- ly fomented by the Governor-General's entourage. . The general feeling of unrest which was caused by this state of things was increased by the incapacity of the local authorities to settle the quarrel which had arisen early in the year between Haji Muin-ut-Tujjar, and Imam Quli Khan, Rustan. over the terms of rent due to the former for the Mamasanni MniW « r00 i P ! left Slliraz for Mamasanni to support Haji Mum ut-Tujjar, while Soulet had sent 300 men for the same purpose.

B tjshire. The history of Bushire for 1922 is largely the history of the increasing influence exerted over local affairs by tbe Central Government and particularly M the Mhiistry of War. We have described already how the road guards m Pars had ^Jeeif taken over by the Military ties and how the troops had been strengthened m that Province, ims was followed hyThe despatch to-Bushire in September of a detachment of six oflicers and 160 nun under the command of Yawar (Major) Muhamma Ah •S T e importance of this move was only appreciated fully when the Minister of War himself visited Bushire towards the end of November. He itiade it clear that the troops were the local representatives of the chief authority S Persia By word and deed he brought home to tbe peop e m Bushire and tL tribe, in the South the hitherto little understood fact that the Cen ra Government in Tehran proposed to govern ; and that he proposed to control the Central Government. In his dealings with the local Khans he entirely ignored the Governor of Bushire, whose position he furthor weakeiicd by Srawine the Police from his authority and placing them under that of he Officer in Command of the troops. But the most unfortunate aspect of the War Minister's visit to Bushire was the anti-British bias which seemed to gu.de his anions- whether this was due to his having heen surrounded by a number ^f^-Ssh mischief-makers, or to his own views is not clear, but the result On his arrival in the to^n he had wasted no time in making a .tSlto to the presence .1 Mleh in Bushire and promising that they were shortly going to he withdrawn as the Persiau Porces in the South were now perfectly capable of ensuring he security of the Gulf Ports: and he had caused a sensation by a^rre^ing on the Keil? «lm.y excuse Ih.t h. l,.d courtesv AUah Karam, the son of Haidar Khan, ot Jianaar Big, wno had come to Bushire at his father's request to pay Ins The circumstances in which the young xnan was arroste. aud tl e^^ father had rendered conspicuous service to the British duiin 0 ' • the general impression that that move was a direct challenge to o^ po-t on m fhe Persian Gulf.

These somewhat sensational incidents and the commanding personality Of the Sipah Salar rather over-shadowed the arrival of His Imperial Majesty the Shah who reached Bushire on his return from Europe on the 29th November. He was greeted with every mark of pleasure and respect by the people of Bushire where he remained for three days. The main streets of the Town and the sea front were decorated in honour of His Majesty's visit and were illuminated at night. His Majesty gave an audience to the Political -Resident at which he was most friendly; and received several deputations from Merchants and others. He left for Shiraz by motor car on the 2nd December, and reached there safely on the 4th December. 3. Economic conditions. With the departure of the War Minister from Bushire, the levy of Bahdari and other illegal exactions began again on the Bashire-Shiraz road. Mention has already been made of the way the conditions of this road deterio rated after the withdrawal of the South Persia Rifles. The protects of the Bushire merchants were quite useless ; they were ordered to go to Shiraz and lay their complaints before the Governor-General. But as it was known that that official could do nothing either to punish the Khans for the blackmail they levied or to secure the road from robbers they did not go ; and no further action was taken. Towards the end of the year the Persian Government sanc tioned some expenditure on repairs to th^ road so as to make it fit for His Imperial Majesty the Shah's imended journey to Shiraz by motor car. Owing to the lateness of the winter rains this journey was as a matter of fact accomplished safely though with difficulty, His Majesty having to walk consi derable distances ; and there are indications that the claim will now be made that the road is 44 Carrossable ' and that the Persian Government is entitled to levy tolls. This is still far from being the case. While trade by land is hampered by the condition still prevailing on the only road from Bushire to the interior, the natural facilities which the sea offers to commerce in the South have been drastically interfered with by the Persian Government whose fiscal policy seems calculated to inflict irreparable harm to trade. Alarmed at the extent to which silver krans (whose intrinsic Value was higher than their exchange value) were being smuggled out of Persia, the Government first prohibited the export of all silver, and then towards the close of the year laid a flat embargo on the export of krans from one Persian port to another under 'cabotage' (coasting pass). The law which thus seeks to strangle inter-coastal trade was passed by the Majlis in December and the full consequences still remain to be seen. They can be Nothing but disastrous to the well-being of the people of the Coasts and Inlands of the Gulf who until the law is modified will be unable to exchange money for commodities of any sort. The prohibition of the export of silver, including rupees, was the subject ot protracted discussion between the Persian Government and His Majesty's Legation in Teheran. The effect of this embargo on the export of a currency which was and still is allowed freely to enter Persia, and which had served the purposes uf trade for many years, was to lock up in the various ports where it circulated and particularly in Bushire, where the Imperial Bank of Persia holds the funds of the Indian Government Treasury, large hoards of rupees, which are entirely immobilized. Eventually the Persian Government were induced to permit the export of rupees, but only on conditions and at a price to the exporter which made it practically impossible to take advantage of the permission. The unwisdom of the Persian Government in these matters, and the uncertainty which the mercantile community now feel as to the prospects of trade in the future gave an importance which nobody at the time seems to have appreciated to the deliberations of the Postal Conference which sat at Bushire from December 5th to 9th in order to propose to the three Governments concerned—Persian, Indian and Iraq—detailed arrangements for the transfer of the Old Indian Posts Offices to the Persian Postal Department which had xi—30. I radministration report of the already been agreed to in p.inciple by the Governments concerned. The conference was a purely technical one, and performed its task with despatch. But it is one thin? to make proposals, quite another thing to put them into pffect The Inspector-General of Persian Posts, who is earnestly doing his best to take over the responsibilities which the Persian Government so lightly assumed, is faced with enormous difficulties largely due to the fact that the Central Government does not appear to have any clear or decided policy m reo-ard to the nse of rupees. Por while on the one hand it is discouraging the circulation of rupees in the Gulf in every possible way, on the other hand it contemplates, and by the agreement made by its delegates is committed to, the introduction of a money order system on a r«pee basis. The continuance of the old mo ley order and Value Payable Parcel faculties given by us for so Ion- and hitherto taken for granted, is of such importance to trade interests in the Gulf that the signidcance of the abolition of the Indian Post Offices is only now beiiv,' realized. In the interests of commerce generally a more practical o-inso of facts as they are and a clear and unambiguous declaration of its fiscal policy on the part of the Persian Government are urgently called for. 4. B tjshire H interland. The Deputy Governorship of Dashti Dashtistan was vacant for a good part of the year, but towards the end of the year Jalil-as-Saltaneh was put in charge. ^ . x» * • -n- a There is not much change in the tribal situation m the Bushire Hinter land in the year under review; the chief characters played their tradi tional parts. Ghanzanfar-as-Saltaneh remained in Borasjun throughout the year, and has lost nothing of his old aptitude for intrigues though outwardly he has kept the promises of good behaviour he gave to the Eesidency when he was brought back to Borasjun in 1921. He interfered actively m the affairs of Shabankareh where there was desultory fighting between the Zabit bohrab Khan and his relative Agha Khan who took up the cudgels on behalf of Jehaniir Khan, the younger brother of Shorab. A party of troops from Borasiun attempted to divide the district between Sohrab Khan and Jehanjir Khan and there was some fighting. Eventually the Governor-General of Pars 6 ent instructions that Sohrah Khan was to remain Zabit. Atrha Khan remained in Daleki as Kalantar until the autumn of 1922 when he suddenly arrived in Bushire to take sanctuary, having heard that the Governor-General in Pars had been bribed to remove him and instal in his stead Yadullah, cousin of Fathullah Khan. Though the Persian Government assured His Maiesty's Legation that they had instructed the Governor-General of Pars not to evict Agha Khan without the consent of his landlord, Nizam-as- Saltaneh, the Officer Commanding, Bushire, under instructions from the Military authorit es in Pars, installed Yadullah, and though later the Minister ot War promised to reinstate Agha Khan, the Officer Commanding troops refused to take action, alleging the receipt of contrary orders from the Minister. The district of Dashti was in an unsettled condition throughout the year. Hussain Khan who was nominally Zabit, was disregarded by the other Khans and it is understood that no revenue was paid in the district. A good deal o smu ogling took place in the small ports on the coast as usual. 0 In Tangistan Zair Khidar continued to give trouble and to intrigue against authority. He refused to pay revenue to the Deputy Governor ot Dashti and Dashtistan, occupied a village in Dashti, encouraged the levying ot ' rahdari ' on caravans at a village on the Shiraz road, and w'th the same obiect in view was credited with the intention of seizing Chaghadak. ^evei the-less he received the title of Ameer Afkhan from the Persian Government during the year; Of the Khans in the Bushire District, Shaikh Hussain of Cliakutah was the most troublesome. He is almost as great an intriguer as Ghazantar-as Saltaneh and mixes himself up in the affairs of all the districts round. ur „ the hot weather he had a ' gumbaz ' (domed tomb) erected near the Iman?.zadeh Close to Sabzabad (the Resident's country house now occupied by him all tne year round) with the intention of transferring with considerable ceremony thePERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921 f remains of his late father Shaikh Hussain who was killed in a fight with the South Persia Eifles. He was persuaded, however, not to do this at the time and so far the remains have not been brought to the tomb. His intention, however is apparently to try and turn Shaikh Hussain into a martyr. Shaikh Mohammed received a title of Salar .Ashja from the Persian Government and he was also granted a robe of honour by the orders of the Minister of War. There was a good deal of desultory fighting between Shaikh Mohammed and his neighbour the Khan of Angali, between whom there is a standing feud. &amp; Except for the fighting with Shaikh Mohammed, Agha Khan kept his district quiet and gave no trouble. It is the disturbed state of the Dashti and Dashtistan district which has' required the presence of British Troops and the Persian Troops so far sent have not been sufficient to reduce it to order. In contradistinction to these districts the district of HayatDaudwas kept in good order as usual by Haidar Khan who paid his revenue regularly and gave no trouble. The districts of Lirawi and Rudhiliah which are governed by relatives of Haidar Khan were also in good order. In spite of this fact Haidar Khan has been persistently attacked by the Persian Grovernment and the War Minister, as has been mentioned above. Certain members of the Majlis notably Mirza Ali Kazeruni have constantly instigated attacks on Haidar Khan and the present Governor of Bushire is not a friend of his. These attacks are due partly to Haidar Khan's friendship for the British; and partly to jealousy inspired by exaggerated ideas as to the benefits Haidar Khan derives from the .Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the revenue he gets from pearl fishing at Kharag. The Government of the District of Behbehan and Kuhgehlu was taken away from the Baktiari towards the end of the year and restored to Fars. Zia-as-Saltaneh arrived at the end of the year as Governor. He soon showed signs of wishing to interfere in Lirawi affairs. 5. ANGLO-PERSIiN OlL COMPANY 'S OPERATIONS. The following note has been kindly recorded by Mr. S. Clegg of the Anglo Persian Oil Company J/imited regarding the work of the Company in the Bikarz (Dasht-i-Qir) area and its relations with the tribes, during 1922. {a) Exploration in the JBiharz {J)asht-i-Qir) Area. —During the first four months of the year progress on road construction proceeded apace, and by the advent of the hot weather at least 45 miles of road had been completed. In the summer months, however, owing to the lack of an adequate water supply and the violent fluctuations in the numbers of coolies available, progress slackened off considerably, and the Company's Eoad Engineer could do little more than work on steep gradients in localities where a small supply of water was available either on the spot or within reach of mule transport. Autumn and the beginning of the rainy season though gave a fillip to the rate of progress, and at the end of the year under review less than six weeks work remained to be finished in order to complete the road as far as the loca tion of the first main tests. The small drilling rig erected near an oil seepage with a view to obtaining a sufficient amount of fuel to feed the boilers for the main tests was at first worked by hand, but in the late spring a small Kelvin engine was tran sported to the well-site (man-handled) and since that time better results have been obtained. At the end of 1922 a depth of approximately 450' had been registered. (6) The Company's relations with local tribes. —-In the spring, just as the tribes were on the point of moving off to their summer quarters, trouble loomed up on the political horizon. The Kashkulis, who are a sub-section of the Qashqai tribe have, for some time past, looked to His Excellency the Qawam- ul-Mulk, Head of the Khamseh tribes, for support on all occasions. The winter habitat of the Kashkulis being far separated from the main Qashqai territory, the former have during recent years aimed for independence, andADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THfi with this idea in view they concluded their agreement with the Company without making any reference to Sardar Ashair, hoping that once the agree ment was a 'fait accompli' it would be an easy matter to 4 square the Ilkhanih if they were backed up by the Company. Sardar Ashair is de facto Ilkhanih of the Qashqais and his son, Mohammed Nasir Khan, Ilkhanih. The former, whose star has been in the ascerident in the troubled politics of Tars since the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles, was considerably chagrined, and maintained that the Kashkulis, in concluding the agieement on Iheir own initiatiye, had infringed the rights of the Ilkhanih. In April, therefore, Sardar Ashair made a hostile demonstration against them, and as most of the Kashkuli leaders are young and in-experienced they took fright and fled, and it was onlv with difficulty that Sardar Ashair was restrained from active interference in the Bikarz Area until such time as the Company s Resident Director could arrange a meeting with him and effect a settlement. This meeting took place at Da Kuhak (near Shiraz) in May, and after lengthy negotiations a modified form of the Kashkuli agreement was connrmed by Sardar Ashair, and a new agreement concluded between the Company and himself. Since these negotiations Sardar Ashair has maintained an exceedinglly friendly attitude towards the Company, and has done what he could to assist them in every way possible. At the same time, by showing dissension amongst the Kashkulis he has contrived, most successfully, to weaken their power and influence m order to keep them in subjection. Indeed, he has actually succeeded m compelling about one-half of the Kashkulis to occupy grazing grounds about 100 miles distant from their hereditary pasture lands in the Bakarz Area and its vicinity. Although Sardar Ashair is probably in a stronger position than he has been for manv years past, there is without doubt a large amount of strife and intri gue amongst the various sections and ruling families of the Qashqais tribe, and whilst this state of affairs would provide openings to a powerful enemy intent on undermining the unity of the Qashqais, on the principle of 'divide and rule it has its advantages to the Ilkhanih as the person responsible for the adminis tration of the tribe as a whole. Therelis always the danger that once a section becomes large and powerful its Headman begins to meditate mdepeudenee. 6. Conclusion. On a review of the events of the past year, the visit to Bushire of the War Minister seems to have the greatest significance. It sent a violent jar through the whole frame work of administration in the South. It was well stage managed; all the circumstances attending it were calculated to impress the people with the fact that the Sipah Salar was introducing a new era tor the Persian Government. The announcement 'V etat c* est moi' seemed m his case to be authentic; and his actions and evident power flattered the national self-esteem. But it was not only British prestige in the South which suffered. The authority of the local Civil Government and the semi-independence ot the tribal Chiefs received shrewd blows. Wliat measure of success will attend Reza Khan s deliberate policy of exalting the power of the Central Government and identifying it with a military hegemony in Persia is a deeply interesting question to which nex year's report may perhaps find an answer. One thing is certain ; the present is a stage of transition. So far as the British position on the Persian side ot the Gulf is concerned a great and rapid change is taking place which will ot course react on the Arabian side. The passing away of old landmarks, the waning ot our prestige which many years of labour and effort had built up, cannot be viewed here without deep regret. The Central Government, howeyer^has yet to show by wisdom and sound administration that it is capable of winning e confidence and good will of the people. Till .it has proved itself, its attempt at centralization in face of enormous administrative and geographical difficulties , and its undermining of the authority both of tribal Chiefs and of local Govern ment constitute a hazarduous experiment.

During 1922 the Bushire Civil Hospital treated Outdoor patients 13,461 Indoor patients 110 and 945 operations were performed. The work on the new Charitable Hospital, built by public subscription! was practically completed by the end of the year. The equipment still remains to be purchased. It is hoped that it may be opened during the next year. Sanitary. During the year the health of the Gulf Ports has been satisfactory except Mohammerah where there was an epidemic of plague lasting from the 1st June to 6th July 1922. Basrah and Mohammerah were declared free from plague on the latter date. The number of cases and deaths of plague at Mohammerah were 44 and 24, respectively. During this period stringent measures for quarantining 2nd class and deck passengers were carried out at all the ports. There was no epidemic of any other sort in any of the Gulf Ports with the exception of Bahrein where one case of cholera was reported to have occurred on the 21st October 1922. This, however, was taken in hand immediately and there was no further spread of the disease.

Administration Report for 1922. Vice-Consulate. Bunder Ahhas. —Mr. A. W. Pagan, I.C.S., held fche post of His Majesty's Vice-Consul, with the personal rank of Consul, throughout the year. LingaTi. —Mr. 8. G. Jackson, I.M.B., held the post of Residency and Consular Agent throughout the year, with the exception of 1J months in the summer, when Mr. E. Holmes, I.M.D., officiated during Mr. Jackson's absence on leave. Eokeign Kepkesentatives. Bunder Ahhas, —Nil. Lingah. —Khan Saheb Haji Ahmad bin Yusuf Khaja continued to act as agent for His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. Minah. —Nil, Local Government. Bunder Ahhas. —Haji Muhammad Hassan continued to hold the post of Deputy Governor until 12th November when he was succeeded by Sartip Mirza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja' NizanT, 0.1.E. Haji Muhammad Hassan was well meaning, but weak, and in his anxiety to appease all parties, he would pass orders and then countermand them, until he possessed very little authority in the district. The recovery of British claims became increasingly difficult daring his regime and eventually the majority of cases were transferred to the Karguzar. The merchants of Qishm made many complaints against him for the appointment of a Zabit, whom they did not want. Shuja' Nizam appears at present rather afraid of his pro-British reputa tion : it remains to be seen whether the memory of past benefits can compete successfully against the hope of future advancement. He has lost no time in finding employment for his son. Lingah. —Muhammad Reza Khan Satwat-ul Mamalik continued to be Deputy Governor until the 18th November when he was relieved by Abdul Keza Khan from Bushire. The strong interest taken by the Lingah Sunnis in the Kemalist question and the anti-Britisli propaganda, in which the party indulges, seem to have somewhat shaken the friendship which he has always shown towards us. He is however the best of all the local Governors and his dismissal is to be regretted. Abdul Eeza Khan had not evinced any obvious predilections upto the close of the year, but he has the reputation of having been pro-Bolshevik. Mindb. —Zair Abdullah Khan continued to be Deputy Governor until the beginning of July when he was succeeded by Mirza Ahmad Khan, the son-in- law of His Excellency Mushar ud Dawlah, Governor of the Gulf Ports. Mirza Ahmad Khan w r as accompanied by Qaid Muhammad Ali Khan, a former Deputy Governor of Minab, in the capacity of assistant. On the transfer of His Excellency Mushar ud Dawlah to Arabistan,- Mirza Ahmad Khan left for Muhammarah and Qaid Muhammad Ali IChan officiated as Deputy Governor to the end of the year. Zair Abdulla Khan committed a serious blunder in giving the Katkhuda- ships of Karyan and Kohistak to proteges of Mir Barkat. Mir Barkat has thus acquired an interest and a footing in the Minab district for which he has always been working, and which it will be difficult to make him relinquish. By making friends with Mir Barkat Zair Abdullah Khan chose the line of least resistance for himself but exposed the inhabitants of the district to perpetual oppression and depredation. On hearing of his dismissal he refused to vacate his post until half the sum spent by him to obtain the Governorship was refunded to him. In adopting'persian gulf political kesidency, 1922 tliis attitude he was probably counting on tbe support of Mir Barkat, and there is little doubt that he was encouraged if not instigated, to do so, by Yamin-ul Mamalik, the Karguzar of Bushire. Yamin-ul Mamalik took Mirza Ahmad to Minab in the Persian Sloop &lt;e Persepolis ' and after some delay Zair Abdullah Khan left for Biyaban and Mirza Ahmad Khan Was installed. It is said that Zair Abdullah Khan received the sum for which he had stipulated. Mirza Ahmad Khan was young and inexperienced, and appears to be well meaning, and not unfriendly, but weak. During the later part of the year Qaid Muhammad Ali was busy trying to secure permanent appointment and did not show the pro^British partisan ship which had characterized his Governorship in 1920. Karguzarate. Bunder Abbas. —Hisam-ul-Vazareh held office until visit of Yamin ul Mamalik, Karguzar of Bushire to Bunder Abbas, early in May when he was superseded by 8adid-ul-Saltanah and transferred to Lingah. Hisam-ul-Vazareh was always outwardly friendly and his dealings with the Consulate were few. Sadid-ul-Saltanah has not b6en a success as Karguzar. His handling of British cases has left much to be desired and he gives passports to all who pay enough for them, without any regard to the requests of the Consulate. He drinks very heavily and is often not in a condition to attend to his work. Ling ah. —Mirza Khalil, the Finance Agent acted as Karguzar in addition to his other duties until he was relieved % Hisam ul Vazareh. Both have given the utmost trouble to the Consular Agency in the matter of Passports, refusing to allow subjects of Bahrein, Oman and Muscat to travel with Agency Passes on the ground that Bahrein is Persian territory and that travellers claiming to be Oman and Muscat subjects are really Persian subjects. Einakce Department. Bunder Abbas. —Mirza Abbas Khan continued to hold office throughout the year, but was seriously ill on two occasions—on the second of which he nearly died of Enteric fever. Lingah. —Mirza Khalil remained in office throughout the year. Com plaints of his extortions have been frequent, and he has taken less trouble to conceal his anti-British propensities than formerly, levying irregular taxes from British subjects and disregarding all protests. His private life i&amp; dissolute in the extreme. Mimb. —Mirza Sadiq Khan remained in office throughout the year. He is openly anti-British and did not call on His Majesty's Consul when he visited Minab in March. He has allied himself with Mir Barkat for the sake of combined plunder and mutual profits. He has given the collection of various taxes into the hands of Mir Barkat's nominees. Customs. Bunder Abbas. —M. Graux, the Director of Customs, proceeded on leave to Belgium on 16th April and returned on 4th November 1922, During his absence M. Ibrahim Eaffo officiated as Director of Customs. M. Graux has always been extremely friendly and most helpful, and M. Haffo maintained the same attitude. The latter incurred the enmity of the Deputy Governor at the time of Muharram and largely as a result of this was transferred on the return of M. Graux. Lingah. —Mirza Muhammad Ali was relieved by Mr. M. J. Perro on the 7th March, but again officiated from 30th April to 28th May while Mr. Eerro proceeded on leave to India. The relations between this Department and the Agency continue to be excellent. xi—30, b^ AbMINISTRATION EEPORT OP THfi falls within the district administered by the Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas and Mudirs are pOvSted at Tiab and Kohistak. Persian Telegraph Department. Bunder Abhas.—'E.&amp;]\ Khan remained in charge throughout the year. He is reputed to be anti-British and to make considerable profit by divulging the contents of telegrams to persons other than those to whom they are addressed. Persian Post Optice. Bunder ^55^.—Sayld Jalal-ud-Din has been Post Master throughout the year. He is conceited, officious and anti-British. He has given much trouble by refusing to receive letters from, or to hold any communication with, the British Post Office, and has made himself objectionable in many petty ways. Ling ah. —Sayid Zaki has held office throughout the year. In pursuance of instructions from his head office he has refused to recog nise the British Post Office. Abdul Hnsain Qishmkwas Post Master until September when he was relieved by Mirza Husain. He was accused of tampering with letters on several occasions and seems to have been objectionaole and untrustworthy. Municipality. Bunder ^^5—Haji Muslim remained in charge until 15th May, when he was dismissed on the insistence of Yaminnl Mamalik and succeeded by Meshedi Ali. Haji Muslim had been head of the Municipality since its formation in 1918. He was capable and industrious and always remained loyal to the &lt; Con sulate. His dismissal (for no reason) was made contrary to His Majesty s Consul's expressed wishes and may be regarded as an expression ot covert hostility. His successor is a nonentity. Lingah.—K.\xa.\a, Zainal held office until May when he was succeeded by Amin-al-Biyayah. The department appears to be as inefficient as ever. Visit op Kargtczar op Bushire. Tamin-ul-Mamalik, Karguzar of Bushire, made a tour of the Gulf Ports iu Persian Sloop ' Persepolis ' in the summer and reached Bunder Abbas on 26th April. Making Bunder Abbas his headquarters he visited Minab (twice), Hormuz, Qishm, Henjam, Kargah and Namakdan on Qishm Island, the Kuh-i-bmau, Lingah and the Sibkuh ports. Salutes of 21 guns were fired from the IJ Persepolis ' in his honour, when he first disembarked at Bunder Abbas ana Lingah. He eventually left Lingah on his return to Bushire on 15th Angus . The most significant of his activities were the dismissal of Haji ^jshm from the Bunder Abbas Municipality, and the support which he undoub e y gave to Zair Abdullah Khan in his refusal to vacate Minab. He made a great outward profession of friendship towards the Consulate but published broadcast the fact that the Consulate was not interested or co - cerned in any local matters. During his presence in Bunder Abbas officials and others accustome 0 visit the Consulate showed considerable reluctance to do sM 101 ? . appeared that friendship with the Consulate was not a passport to bis tavour. lie interfered in every local question and case m which he could andadve his own importance to an incredible extent. It was popularly supposed that he was intriguing to supersede t e Governor of the Gulf Ports, and before the end of the year he had secured post.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCE, 1922. Condition of Country. BunderAbhas.—A. murder was committed at Kishar and the assistance of the Deputy Governor of Lingah was solicited by the Deputy Governor in apprehending the accused. Resistance was offered and no arrest made. Lingah. —The district has been quiet throughout the year. A burglary was committed in the shop of a Hindu goldsmith in the town. Minah. —The town and district have been more exposed to depredations from Biyaban and Bashakird than ever. The policy of Zair Abdullah Khan and the Finance Agent has legalised the presence in Minab of such notorious robbers as Eaquih Qasim, Mir Hoti and Mir Yaqub. The shop of a Hindu was broken into, and goods valued at Krans 2,802 were reported as stolen. Nothing had been recovered upto the end of the year. • The agent of a Hyderabad! merchant ifi Minab was seized by Baluchis near Tiyab and only released on payment of a ransom of Tomans 200. The ransom has so far not been recovered. Condition of Eoads. Bunder Abbas. —About 25th January a robbery of donkeys was reported between Beghu and Kalkazi. The number of animals reported as stolen varied between 30 and 150. On 1st February three donkeys with loads were reported to have been stolen near Tazbar when on the way to Minab. On 5th July a whole caravan of 135 camels was reported to have been cap tured by Baharlusat Gelu Anjir near Daulatabad on the Bundar Abbas-Kerman road. Two camel drivers were said to have been wounded and twelve kid napped. Another party of robbers were said to be blocking the Zaneh pass and stopping all caravans. On 13th September a caravan mainly composed of sugar and belonging to Hindu merchants was robbed near Kalkazi about 15 miles from Bunder Abbas on the way to Kerman. Forty four loads were subsequently recovered, but the remainder, said to be 36 loads, had not been recovered up to the end of the year. A report was received that 60 donkeys without loads had been stolen hear Kushkuh about the 16th November, and that the Jilaodars enlisted the aid of some tufangchis belonging to Agha Haji Kalantar of Darogha and attacked the robbers. All the donkeys were said to have been recovered, and 4 robbers and 4 donkeys killed, and 1 robber captured. About 14th December 40 camels without loads were reported to have been stolen near Baghu. Minah. —All the Minab roads have been unsafe during the year, and robberies have been frequent. Early in October a Hindu travelling from Minab to Bander Abbas was robbed by Baluchis near Mugh Ibrahim. The information he gave was vague and nothing has been recovered, Lingah. —No robberies have been reported during the year. Arms Traffic. No cases have been reported during the year. S hip WREcks. A dhow belonging to a British Indian Charbar merchant said to have been carrying charcoal caught fire off Kargah and was practically destroyed. Bunder Abbas-Kerman Telegraph Line. Cases of wilful damage to lines and insulators, particularly between Chah Chakur and Kushkuh, have been reported with increasing frequency and theAdministration report of the local authorities appear to be quite unable, or unwilling, to cope with the question. Aviation. Flight Lieutenant Hosking with two British Banks of the Royal Air Eorce paid a visit of inspection in May and remained about ten days. Mai or Blake and Captains Macmillan and Malins arrived at Abbas about 6 a.m ., on the 18tb July, oa their attempted flight round the world, and left for Charbar at 3 p.m . They had left Bushire at 3 p.m ., on the 17th and were expected in Bunder Abbas the same evening, but were unable to reach Bundar Abbas in daylight. They landed at Bostaneh about miles west of Bunder Abbas on the coast and spent the night mere. All the Persian officials, leading merchants and others had collected at the Consulate to witness their arrival on the ITlh evening. The Deputy Governor and a few local inhabitants only were present w T hen they left for Charbar. Visits or His Majesty's Eepresentatiyes. Bunder ATybns. —The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C. S. L, C. I. E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited Bunder Abbas m 11. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' on the 1st May, Excellency Sir Percy Z. Cox, G.C. S. L, G. C. I. K, G.C.M. G., High Commissioner at Baghdad, visited Henjam on the btli December. British Indian Troops. The detachment of the 2-112th Infantry was relieved on 14th March by a Detachment of tbe 9th Bhopals commanded by Lieutenant bteabben. Captain Mclntyre took over command from Lieutenant Steabben on the 5th April and was relieved by Lieutenant Amor on 1st October. On lOoh October the detachment was relieved by a party about 80 strong under 2nd-Lieutenant Northam and Captain Beadon took over command from 2nd-Lieutenant Northam on the 25th October. Tlie health of the troops has not been so good as in the preceding year. Political Prisoners. Seven Political deportees were sent from Baghdad and interned in Heniam on 26th September. One Platoon of the 9th Bbopal Infantry unde r an Indian officer has supplied their guards and Khan Saheb Ibrahim GoMan has fed them at a contract rate of Bs. 4-8 per diem. Mr. C. Murray, Officer in Charge, ludo-European Telegraph Department at Henjam has been in charge of the general arrangements under the instructions of His Majesty s Consul, Bunder Abba^ Trade and Commerce. Bunder Abhas.—1h&lt;i slump in trade which marked 1921, has continued and many Hindu merchants have closed down their business and returned India. Those, who remain have learnt a lesson from the previous year, and seem to be exercising more caution in their transactions. The uniformly hi|h fate of Exchange anl the depression begun in 1921 bave operated to res am speculation and terminate meteoric enterprises ; the result is that very dull, but less dangerous than before. There have been many failures among Persian shopkeepers and considerable difficulty has been expen ' the recovery of British claims in consequence. There have been no Bnt,sb failures this year. The prohibition of the export of krans has been extended to include cabotage, and on 16th November orders were received limiting the export of rupees to 10,000 monthly from Bunder Abbas.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1921 if The legislation of the Persian Government appears likely to strangle rather than develop trade in this area. Statistics are not available, as the Persian year closes on the 20th March bnt it seems probable that the imports will prove to have decreased consider ably and the exports to have increased slightly owing to the year having been more fertile than the previous one. The British India Steam Navigation Company maintained a regular weekly service both from Bombay and from Basrah during the year and other steamers (all flying the British flag) have visited Bunder Abbas on 30 occasions. Lingah. —The pearl season has been the best known for several years and consequently the trade of Lingah has improved. About 5,180 donkeys and 2,150 camels left for Lar laden with Kerosine Oil, piece-goods and sugar, 4,536 donkeys and 452 camels arrived from Bastak and Lar laden chiefly with carpets, roses, ghi and oilseeds. The British India Steam Navigation Company maintained a regular service throughout the year, steamers calling weekly from Bombay and fort nightly from Basrah, Steamers of other lines called 9 times. W eather. Good rain fell in the winter of 1921-22. Crops were good and water plentiful in Birkehs and wells. The summer was comparatively mild, but began early and lasted long. P olitical situation. Our prestige continues to decline. The impression created by the anti-British Press campaign (from Berlin and Egypt as well as from the interior of Persia), by the attitude adopted by the Kemalist Party and by the machinations of Bolshevik agents in North of Persia are strengthened by our policy of retrenchment, withdrawal and non interference. The policy now pursued by the Consulate is contrasted with its omni potence during the 'War and in the days when the South Persia Rifles flourished and money was plentiful; and unflattering conclusions are drawn. Overt hostility appears however to be confined almost entirely to officials who are not natives of the district and who come to fill their pockets at the expense of the local inhabitants. The latter seem to recognise the fact of our changed status and in most cases to regret it, though they rriay not admit as much. Gratitude for past benefits is not a virtue common among Persians. In Lingah, where the Sunni community are strongly influenced by Kemalist Propaganda, the anti-British feeling is somewhat stronger and the officials derive more support from the local inhabitants. The practical result of these tendencies is petty annoyance on the part of minor officials and obstruction instead of assistance in the settlement of British claims. S lave T raffic.

Anglo-Persian Oil Company Wells at Salahh. Staff.— Wy . H. W. Hole, Fields Manager, was relieved by Mr. N. Suther land in May. Guards.—On the 31st May the Indian Infantry Guard was withdrawn and replaced by Tufaugchis supplied by the Khan of Bastak through the mediation of His Majesty^ Consul, Bunder Abbas. Communications.—-ytith the departure of the Military guard heliographic communication with Henjam ceased. The construction of a motor road from Has Tarkun to Biristan was begun, but had not been completed by the end of the year. Test well. —Last year a depth of 3,056 feet was reached and an oil show was reported. As water was not shut off a lead plug was driven into the bottom of the hole and the two smaller sizes of casing were pulled with a view to excluding water with larger sized pipe. In consequence of this reaming and cleaning out operations from a depth of 1,815 feet were necessary, and at the beginning of the year work was proceeding at this depth. Besides the lead plug there were other obstructions in the shape of tools left in the hole and these threatened to be troublesome. Better fortune was experienced than was anticipated and the hole was clear before Christmas, a depth of 3,070 feet being reached. Absolutely no indications of the oil show formerly reported have been encountered ; drilling ahead is in progress with a view to going to maximum depth possible unless oil is encountered. Salt. —During the year 4,600 tons of salt were shipped to Abadan for the use of the refinery. In the summer the lease of the salt mines changed hands. Imperial Bank of Persia —Mr. A. B. Hutchison remained Manager of the Bunder Abbas Branch throughout the year. The trade of Bunder Abbas during the year 1922 has shown a large decrease compared with the year 1921. During the early part of 1921 there were still some of the South Persia Eifles in Bunder Abbas which gave employment to a certain mituber of the inhabitants of the town, and consequently more money circulated in the town. The local trade of Bunder Abbas and the outlying villages is very small. During the past year there have been very few goods imported for local use. According to the Bank figures there have been just as many goods exported to India as have been imported from India. Most of the goods exported such as dried fruits, cotton, etc., have come from Sirjan and Eafsinjan and the surrounding districts, but part of tbe exchange on Bombay against the exported goods has been sold here by the Agents of the Sirjan and Rafsinjan merchants. So far there does not appear to be any hope of the local trade of Bunder Abbas increasing. The prosperity of Bunder Abbas depends entirely on the transportation of imported goods purchased for the Yezd and Kerman markets, and the various smaller towns on the way to those two places. This has also shov^n a large decrease compared with the year 1921, this may be partly accounted for by the fact that there is now a smaller demand all over Persia for the imported goods but mainly, in the opinion of the Bank, owing to the Duzdab route now supplying the Kerman market with goods. The Duzdab route is much quicker and it is ^aid that there is less pilfering on that route than on the Bunder Abbas route. So far information has not been received whether the Duzdab route is as cheap as the Bunder Abbas route. The Bank is of the opinion that it is not, but should the Duzdab route eventually become as cheapPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL HESIDEKCt, 1922. jg as the Bander Abbas route, Bunder Abbas from a commercial point of view will cease to exist. During the past 3 ear three merchants have gone bankrupt, one of them owning quite a large sum for Bunder Abbas. His failure was mainly due to gambling in Foreign Exchange. The Bank is of the opinion that the Bunder Abbas merchants during the past year in many cases ' only cleared their expenses.' The only hope o£ a renewed prosperity for Bunder Abbas would be the finding of oil in paying quantities on the Island of Kishm by the Acglo- Persian Oil Company. Messrs. Frank Strick &amp; Co. The last consignment of Red Oxide from Hormuz was shipped by Messrs. F. Strick &amp; Co., daring the year under the terms of their former contract, but Messrs. Strick were compelled to pay more towards the expenses than they had contracted to do. i Quarantine and Medical. Bunder Ahhas. —Assistant Surgeon D. L. Mackay, I.M.D., remained in charge of Quarantine, and of the Consulate Charitable Dispensary throughout the year. Prevailing Diseases,—Ths most prevalent diseases during the year were, malaria, diseases of the eye, diseases of the digestive system, respiratory diseases and dysentery. Of these diseases, all show an increase on last year with the exception of dysentery and diseases of the eye which show a decrease. The groups of diseases mentioned are tabulated below for comparison with those of the previous year. Diseases of the digestive system Diseases of the Eye .s. Respiratory diseases ... Malaria Dysentery Deaths. —One death occurred and was due to Pyaemia as compared with 5 deaths the previous year from other causes.

During the summer months the attendance of patients fell off the same as the previous year for the reason that a large number of the inhabitants left the town during the intense heat. Patients in fair numbers attend from outlying villages and a good deal of attendances are from people arriving by caravans from inland. Dispensary Building. —The dispensary building is in a good state of repair, no sum being expended on repairs during the year. The furniture, equipment and fittings are in a serviceable condition. Epidemics.' —No epidemic diseases broke out in the station during the year. All precautions were taken with regard to the inspection of crews and passengers arriving by country craft from the Arabian Coast when there was any reason to suspect infectious disease existing there.

Incision and removal of small tumours. One operation worthy of comment was that of a case of protracted labour where cephalotripsy was performed and the woman made a complete recovery. All cas^s operated on recovered. Sanitation of^ Town. —The sanitation of the town may be considered as bad. The Municipality works to keep the bazaars and the surroundings of houses clean. The inhabitants practise no sanitation. The interior of ;good many houses reveal rubbish heaps and these form ample breeding grounds for flies which are abundant. Advice given on the dangers of these conditions receive a deaf ear. Cause of Frevalance of Malaria Fevers. —The practice of storing water in cement cisterns and open earthenware pots furnish all that is necessary for the breeding of mosquitoes. Most houses in the town have large cement cisterns where the water is seldom or never changed. Mosquitoes are numerous nearly all the year round and malaria gives a high percentage of cases treated. Ling ah. —Assistant Surgeon S. G. Jackson performed the duties of tha Quarantine Medical Officer except when he went to India on a month's leave when he was relieved by Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes, I.M.D. No cases of infectious diseases were landed from vessels. Health of the Town. —Small-pox is epidemic but the natives are so accustomed to this that they do not call in the Medical Officer in cases of this disease. 1,630 persons attended at the Dispensary during the year as compared with ja naarj iss 1 ' 621 . 1921.

Grey until the 2/th November when he was relieved by Lieutenant- tolonel U -D. H.. Haworth, who had previously acted as Consul in 1905. Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim acted as Extra Eesident and until 28th Teb- 1 A ua ^, 0 ffi cl ^ted as Vice-Consul. He was relieved of his duties as Extra Assistant Resident by Khan Bahadur Mohammed Ali Sufi on the 15th October. Persian Officials. His Excellency J'afar Kuli Khan, Sardar Assad held the post of Governor- General up to September. The change for the worse in the behaviour on the part of Sardar Assad, reported in the previous year, continued until his departure his conduct was openly anti-British and, before he left, he boasted that he had destroyed the pro-British party of Kerman, and in fact by the beo-innino- of January, al pro-British notables had left the place, owing to the hostility which he had displayed towards them. Early in the year he apparently heard that his position in Kerman was not very secure owing to the condition of the roads on which he maintained insufficient protection, as he was embezzling most of the money allowed for the purpose of road guards. He accordingly began to collect telegrams of satistaction with his Government from priests, merchants and notables a custom followed by every official who is in doubt of the stability of his position Or who has been dismissed. The Finance Agent was however instructed from Tehran to report the Governor-General's income from sources other than his budget grant. Early in the year, some of the Democrats, who had been the creatures of Sardar Assad, had apparently got tired of him and they also telegraphed to Muayyid-ul-Islam, the Kerman Democrat Wakil in Tehran, asking him to press for his dismissal. The Muayyid replied that the Moderates were also demanding the Governor-General's dismissal and that he could not support them. It was, however, evident that in the circumstances the Sardar Assad's rule would not be a very long one but it Was not until August that he received a telegram sanctioning two months' leave for him and he finally left Kerman on the 7th September. His rule has been one of the old Persian style^ i.e, s free embezzlement from every possible source. It is estimated that he made Ts. 8,000 per mensem from the budget for Sowars Road Guards alone of whom he kept but 40. His total income from all sources has been est-mated at Ts. 20,000 a month or in round figures £4,000 per annum until March when the new army, the Departments of Nazmieh (Police) and Amnieh (Safety) were formed! His pay was then fixed as follows : — Governor-General, Tsi 1,200. Deputy Governor-General, Ts. 250- Offirp Staff and menials, Ts. 272. It is a commentary on what he made elsewhere that even with this reduced possibility for misappropriation he still desired to continue as Governor- General. On his departure Haji Fath-ul-Mulk, the Pinance Agentj took over charge^ but orders were received from Tehran that Yawar Mohammad Khan, the Officer Commanding the troops, was to officiate pending the arrival of the new Governor-General Sardar Moazzim. Sardar Assad's Deputy Mufakhir-es-Sultaneh with he staff left On the 3 6th September, thus closing the connection of his Chief with the place. A party of supporters had taken bast in the Telegraph Office and a section ofu Administration report of the Democrats in close toucb. with the Russian Oorisulate had proposed to send a deputation of four men to Tehran by motor car to pull the strings for his retention, a subscription being raised for the purpose, but the new Governor- General being apparently about to start the attempt was given up and Sardar Assad's departure aoquiesad in. Sirdir Assad was evidently considered as a protega oE the Radians sinoa a subseq lent rumour of his appointment to Meshed was looked upon as a Russian success. There are constant rumours that he is trying to get back to Kerman. Sardar Moazzim, the new Governor-Geaeral, arrived at Kerman on the 2 .st Octobsr. He is a Khurasan! who commanded the forces at Meshed at one timo and married the daughter of a Governor-General of Meshed. He subse quently became one of the Ihputies for Meshed and ultimately was Minister of Justice in the Cabinet of Moshir-ed-Douleh. Sardar Moazzim was educated at a military college in Russia, speaks French and Russian perfectly and is to all intents and purposes an European. He is a man of delightful manners and very pleasant to mix with. itis situation is a duTicult one since his income is not a tithe of that enjoyed by his predecessor and I doubt if it is sufficient for him to keep up his position.. TJnder the new system the power of the Governor-General has been considei- ably cut down. All departments correspond directly with their Ministers in. Tehran and flout the authority of the Governor-General. Sardar Moazzim complained to me that the Officer Commanding the troops in Kerman had undertaken an expedition into Jiruft and Narmshir against his expressed desire with the result that the unruly chiefs of those parts had realized that they could with imp mity disregird all the force which the Army could for the present detach against them. The expedition which had apparently been Lrano-ed between the Rais-i-Malieh and the RaiS-i-Kashum for the recovery of Revenue resulted in certain moneys being obtained some by force and some by right—not all of which found its way into the Imperial Revenues. Sardar Moazzim, though the reverse of anti-Foreign, shows very clearly that he is anxious for Persia to find her own salvation though in the same breath he has expressed his hopelessness of her ever doing so. He is at present showing remarkable partiality for the Democrats but this is only policy and he is no doubt playing his own game for the future when he re-enters the Majliss, His own views are not in accordance with their general conduct. Kargtjzari. Maiallal-as-Saltaneh held charge of the office of Kargazar throughout the tear. He has no anti-British bias, his main occupation being to make a smt- Itble income. It is estimated that to keep his position he requires at least Ts. SOO per mensem or say Rs. 80J per month. The Persian Government pays him half this sum and therefore cannot, and probably does not, complain that he takes other means to supplement his income. He is somewhat indiscreet and so it is necessary to be careful in dealing with him. He has the reputation Of a hard drinker and maintains a considerable Harem. Finance and Revenue Department. Mohandisel Mamalik left Kerman on the 8tli January and his successor Fath-ul-Mulk arrived on the 12th. This officer who is.a capable man, making a claim to honesty and being a patriot appears to be very anti -boreisn aiid uses an anti-British atmosphere as a political asset. He is taking a leadin 0 part in local politics, is closely allied to the Democrat party and is, with the Officer Commanding the troops, the only chief official who did not Ball upon the British Consul upon his arrival. He is doing his best to undermine authority of the Governor-General. It is understood that he is aiming at catering the Majliss with the idea of ultimately reaching the Cabinet. He understands the use of judicious self -advertisement and is an adept in the fcrt of propaganda by suggestion. The general idea is that he is a capable man who will rise.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 25 Department op Education and Religious Bequests. This Department was in the hands Tof Mirza Reza Khan Tahimi whose anti-British bias was the subject of report last year. He continued in the same vein until the departure of Sardar Assad but with the advent of the new Governor-General has had little opportunity for its-display. He was finally dismissed at the end of the year, he has had several dismissals but was able to meet his difficulties with the support of Sardar Assad and also no doubt with the support of his brother Pahim-ul-Mulk who was a member of the Cabinet throughout the year. 3?ahimi was educated for some seven years in France and is reported to have made some very considerable sum, estimated at from Ts. 15,000 to 20,000, out of religious bequests during his incumbency. He opposed strongly the pro-British Mujtahid Haji Mirza Ali Mohammed and assisted very great ly in taking certain religious bequests out of the latter's hands not with any praiseworthy desire to improve matters but with the intention of enabling the funds to pass through the adhesive fingers of his own personal friends and parti sans. It is possible that these funds were not adjusted by Haji Mirza Ali Mohammad with that sense of impartiality which one might associate with a high dignatary of the church but such change as was made was purely for per sonal and political reasons. It may be added that Fahimi was also instrumen tal in introducing the Democrat element to the Russian Consul, The Department of Indirect taxes and the Department of Justice.—QsW for no special remark. The former charge was held by Colonel Earamurz Khan, an Armenian, until the end of the year when he was received by Mufakham es Saltaneh who came from Tehran. The latter is, I should gather, a well meaning and friendly person determined to do the best for his department but perhaps somewhat tactless in his methods. The department of justice was held by Mirza Abdul Rahim Khan who no doubt gave the Persians the quality of justice to which they are attuned. He is a very pleasant person and appears well disposed. The Solieh section of the Department which decided civil suits to the value of Tomans 250 was abolished as a measure of economy, its duties being now performed by the Ibtidai Court (of First Instance). The Army. At the beginning of the year a circular telegram was received from the Ministry of War stating that the Headquarters of the Southern Army were being established at Isfahan under Mir Panj Mahmoud Khan. At the time the only person to whom the telegram could be delivered was the Officer Commanding the 50 sarbazes at Kermam Shortly afterwards news was received ^ that an officer would be appointed to the command of the troops and the Financial Agent was instructed that the demands of the Army were to have precedence over those of any other department. In March the Financial Agent received orders that the Department of Karasuran (Road Guards) and Local Government Sowars had # been abolished. The Budget for these two departments which had been, as already stated, in the hands of the Governor-General had amounted to Ts. 12,000 per mensem and provided him with a private income of Ts. 8,000 per month at the expense of the public. The income from Crown Lands and the Department of Indirect Taxes was now earmarked for military purposes. Amir Lashkar arrived on a visit to Kerman in March in connection with the forpaation of the new army and Yawar Mohammed Khan, subsequently promoted to Naib Sarhang, formerly of the Cossack Brigade at Tehran, was appointed to raise and command the local troops. _ Most of the Persian Officers who had served with the Southern Persian Rifles desired to ioin the new force. Amir Lashkar was then informed that a new, department of Amnieh (Safety) which replaced the Karasuran was to be placed under a military officer. In April 30 officers and Non -Commissioned Officers arrived from Isfahan and instructions were received that officers of the South Persia Rifles might n XI—30.16 administration report of the be taken on probation but that tbey were to be warned that they were no lonepr ** servant of the British S Recruifcs did not, however, come in very rapidly and in a short time these forcible enlistments of men began to cause much dissatisfaction and in some places villages with standing crops were deserted on the news of the approach of recruiting parties. If this however gave no general pleasure it was the cause of much satisfaction to the officer commanding the troops who is popularly supposed to have made no less than Ts. 20,000 through those selec ted buying themselves off. The officer commanding the detachment at Bam deserted having also collected a very respectable sum in the same manner. Though officers of the South Persia Rifles (many of whom wished to resign but were not permitted to do so), are somewhat disgusted when comparing their present force with their former corps, there is no question that the new army is a great advance on anything the Persians have as yet had in the outlvioi provinces. ' 0 Their number is supposed to be 2,000 men with officers but there are ac tually at present only about 1,000 men of whom 120 are Oavalrv and 60 Ar* tillery. The army is distributed as follows Headquarters, Kerman (Army Headquarters, Ispahan). Officer Commanding Men. Kerman . , » . Naib Sarhang , , . 3C9. Bunder Abbas . Naib Awwal . , . 150 Yezd . . . Naib . . # . 150 Sirjan • . Naib . 150 Bam » . Naib AwWal , , . 100 The strength of the Eerman Headquarters is being recruited up to 1,000 men. The Amnieh Department, under the Ministry of War, is commanded by a Sultan in the Army. Its numbers are only 100 of whom 50 are cavalry but its connection with the army no doubt assisted in keeping the roads quiet. The Nizamieh or police is also being organized on lines which are an improve ment on the past, but as the Governor-General has no control over it, and it appears to have no connection with the Civil Administration, its formation is likely to lead to friction. Local Politics. As noted last year the Democrat party began to obtain importance owing to the support given them by Sardar Assad. Throughout the year this sup port was continued and on the departure of Sardar Assad was replaced by that of Hazi Fatnel-Mulk, the Einance Agent and of Naib Sarhang Mohamed Khan, the officer commanding the troops. Both are, owing to their position, very influential men and by their support gave as much, if not more, importance to the Democrats than they had obtained from the support of the Governor- General. The basis of the Sardar Assad's action was the fact that the Demo crat party is composed of those who were anti-British during the war, many of them having assumed a pro-German position during the German occupation and several of them having been deported by General Sykes. It was a natural sequence of those events that, on the arrival of the Russian Soviet Consul, the Democrat party received him with acclamation and provided him with a fulcrum on which to commence work. The Bais-i-Kusum, as supporter of the Democrats, became a constant visitor to the Russians and Eahimi, as already stated, introduced members of the Democrat community to the Russian Con sulate who thus became identified with the Democratic party and began to subscribe to their funds.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCE, 192I The importance of the Democratic party may be ascribed to fortuitous • The same few names recur year after year in circumstances and Would hnt fnr rvffipiol the Diaries and Administration Eeport. snmmrf nnnco l J OUt lor OttlCial , , , support, cease.

The Editor was a Democrat Adin-uMslam. better known as Dargahi, who was deported to Shiraz by General Sykes. He is not without wit and Sardar Nusrat's pilgrimage to Kerbala was referred to as ' a pilgrimage to the Chief Commissioner of Iraq '. An article on the ways, habits and natural history of vampires, with Sardar Nusrat appearing in the leading role, was another of his great efforts. &amp; Russian Activities. It had early been rumoured that a Russian Soviet Consul was to be appointed to Kerman and on the 9th June he duly arrived in the person of one M. Appolon Evetsky, a former officer of the Commissariat Department of the Imperial Russian Army at Tashkend, who had been Soviet Consul at Resht and also Chief of the Propaganda Department at the Legation at Tehran. M. Evetsky (who was accompanied by his wife, a lady of the Beltic Pro* vinces who wears a most uncommunistic amount of jewellery on her handsk speaks no known language except his own and has made but little progress' with Persian. He is a devotee to arrack and would by himself do little. His Vice-Consul is Mirza Ibrahim Khan, a Persian from Moscow born of a Russian mother, a man of intelligence and capacity who perforins his part of the con tract well. Both ot them state that they were Mensheviks and not Bolsheviks and in their propaganda lay great stress on the change in Bolshevik policy on the subject of capital and wages. Their local activities have been noted on under the heading Democrats and it only remains to be said that they are conducting a campaign chiefly among the military, work men and peasants. They are also working among the non-Persian races the Persis, Jews and Armenians. Sarushian, one of the leading Persis, on instructions from the Persi firm of Tehran made arrangements for his house and for his arrival and the relationship thus commenced bas continued. At present the Bolshevistic campaign has little effect but that it is dan gerous there can be no question. The Persians think it is harmless because most of them consider that it is against the tenets of the Koran which even among the irreligious Persians has a conservative hold and they are of the opinion that because it does not appear to the upper classes who rule in Persia therefore it can make no advance. Consequently in allying themselves with the Russians as in the ca^e of the important Khawanin land owning family, they think that they are making use of the. Russians but they do not realise that at the same time the Russians are very much making use of them as a base from which they can disseminate their views even among the very dependents of those who visit them. The hoisting of the Soviet flag at the Consulate did not take place till the 7th November. It is understood that the delay was due to want of funds. The ceremony was attended by the Governor-General, the Karguzar and certain officials, by the Khawanin family and the Democrat party and also a considerable number of labourers and workmen. The Consul made a short speech in Eussian followed by a very long trans lation read by Mirza Ha s an. In it he stated that the old Russian flag was of three colours, white represented the Czar, blue the uniform of the Czar's Police and red represented the deluge of bloodshed which had innundated the country. He then proceed to hoist a flag which was all red.amnxistratiox report of the la November a notice was posted in Bam signed by Hasan Khan Mujti- bazada, the Russian Oonsulate Mirza, calling upon the peasants to take revenge not only upon the property of Sardar Mujalial, the Deputy Q-overnor of Bam, and that of Sardar Nusret but upon their persons. Condition op Roabs. Bandar Abbas to Kerman.—ln June a Buchakchi caravan of donkeys was attacked and looted near Saidabad by Arab robbers and casualties occurred on both sides, following this 40 Earsi Arab robbers attacked the villages ol Patehabad and Nasiriyeh, two Farsakhs from Saidabad carrying away 400 sheep, 40 cows and 50 donkeys. In September a large caravan belonging to Hindus was looted near Kaleh Kazi. Khrman to Yezd. The condition of this road was constantly bad. In January reports came that the villages around Rafsinjau were terrorised by robbers. A party of Parsi robbers were captured by the Deputy Governor in January but the following day at a point further along the road near Kermanshahan another party of 'robbers looted an entire caravan of sugar, piece goods and yarn, carrying away all the merchandise. Sardar Assad was drawing pay for 100 Sowars besides the Karasuran budget for this road but actually had a total force of 40 Sowars and a few Karasuran guards. At the same time reports from Anar showed that the Girdukh-Anar sec tion was in a bad way; there were no road guards and posts and caravans were being held up. Hindu traders are still waiting for proper compensation for the big robbery which took place on the road the previous September of 1921 on ^vhich the compensation given did not cover the expense of sending Mamurs to the Governor-General of Fars. On the 8tli February a caravan of camels was attacleed near Shemsh, 58 loaded and unloaded camels being carried away. These however were recovered by Karasuran. At the end of the month a skirmish took place between Bakhtiari sowars and Tarsi robbers in which both sides suffered casualties. Owing to the migration of the tribes to their summer quarters the roads remained safe till October whtfn reports were received that robbers were in terrupting traffic between Anar and Mehdiabad, but no special robberies were reported 'and no further cases of robbery came to notice till the end oi the year. By this time the Amnieh had been formed and the greater safety of the road is the severest criticism of the system of Government of Sardar Assad. The robberies which occurred with impunity were duo to the fact that he was filling his pockets at the rate of thousands of pounds a year by drawing pay for guards whom he never kept up and there is no question that with the large sums he made he should be made responsible and should pay for the heavy losses incurred by British subjects. Kbrman Khabis Seistan Roab. Early in the year reports came of constant depredations on this load by Wali Mohammed Shir Dil Baluch who with a large band accumulated considerable booty while he was also occasionally ^ busy around the Duzdab district. At the end of January news was received that he had returned to his home with loot of about 300 camels and 2,000 sheep.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 29 D uzdab- K erman H oad.

Dudah. lo anyone who has not travelled on it it would be impossible to believe that cars could proceed by such a road. The very bad places are however but few and could with a small expenditure be put in sufficient condition for Pord cars to pass over. Whether the road can compete with the Bandar Abba^ route for general traffic is a point which the next year will probably decide. Its advantages are great both for travellers and goods ; for the former it brings Quetta with in 10 days of Kerman, and for the latter it provides an easy route which, with arrangements for water and halting places, would be in many ways preferable to the Bunder Abbas route. It has also the very great advantage of avoiding the difficult landing at Bunder Abbas and the pilfering on the British India steamers to that port. The ultimate test is, however, the cost and that is a point which this year should decide, formerly with the rebate on the Quetta- Duzdab railway it was possible to compete ; now that benefit has been with drawn the question remains to be decided. The fact however remains that the big carpet firms are all using this road in preference to the Bunder Ablas road. BRITISH INTERESTS. 1, P olitical. The position of the British in Kerman has undergone a very great change. During the regime of the South Persia Rifles they were naturally all-powerful and no appointment was made without considering their desires in the higher appointments and their interests in the lower ones. Officers of all kinds and of all ranks came to them for their recommendation to obtain appointments. This continued, for a little time but the active hostility of Sardar Assad combined with the anti-British feeling in Persia to a considerable extent justified his boast that he had broken the pro-British party in Kerman. It was evident that if being on terms with the British Consulate was the reverse ot* a recom^ mendation, only those who were independent and were drawn by inclination and those who were too lie to change would find it to their advantage to be seen there. A certain contingent probably thought it worth while on the grounds that the power of the British could not cease while the hostile Governor was bound to go. As long as Sardar Assad was here however he kept to his promise that certain Governorships should not be changed without the concurrence of the British Consul. With the arrival of the new Governor-General this was changed and between the departure of Major Grey and the arrival of Colonel Haworth the Governor of Sirjan, Mirza Mahmoud Khan, a strong supporter of the British, who had been of great assistance to the South Persia Rifles and held many letters of recommendation from them, was dismissed. This was followed by the threat to dismiss Sardar Mujallal, the Governor of Bam, also an old friend of the British. The grounds for this dismissal were perhaps sufficient if true, but the matter did not reach determination since (though after the close of the year) the usual payment to the Governor-General prevented the question being brought to a head. In the month of August His Majesty's Minister issued instructions that the only method to meet the anti-British campaign in the Persian papers and among the Persian officials was strict non-intervention in local politics. There is no question that for British policy to become bound up with one Persian party or another would only make things worse and would have two bad results ; firstly it would dri^e the oth^r side into the arms of the Russians and thus assist Bolshevism ; secondly, if that party came into power the result would be felt throughout Persia with all who wished well to the British : at the same time XI—30. ' xg Q ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE a sudden ctailge is somewhat difficult since those of our friends who have been loyal to us and have assisted us often in difficult circumstances would justly have a cause of complaint, were we, at one stroke, to cease to give them support. Mirza Ahmad Khan, the Persian Chief of Telegraphs, was an outspoken friend of the British and for that reason and no other was ousted from his position by the machinations of the anti-British officials headed by Sardar -Assad. The intervention of the Minister at Tehran was unable to prevent this but at any rate he knew that we had not used him and dropped him. The Sardar Nusret and Haji Mirza Ali Mohamed both had to leave Kerman for no reason but their friendliness to us and the former is to this day the subject of abuse not only in Kerman papers but in those published so far afield as Meshed and Shiraz. To drop these men is impossible, it would not only be ungrateful but impolitic since it would destroy confidence in the British character and it has accordingly been His Britannic Majesty's Consul's endeavour to let them know that while he is not unmindful of the services which they have rendered he cannot assist them if the circumstances show cause of legitimate complaint against them. It is inevitable in Persia in the condition of its development that our friends are not always so white as we might desire while an unavoidable evil of our past policy has been that we appear to support the autocratic nobles, an ano maly with a country which is the leader of the democracy of the world, when dealing with a country which however unfitted it may as yet be for a full democratic ideal^ has at any rate sown the seed of democracy and has formed a Parliament which if it follows the normal course of history will no doubt in the course of time attain suoh democracy as may be possible of an attainment in an Eastern country. Trade. As noted under Banking there is little enough to write about Trade. Two bad years for crops and the general high prices ranging made a year of great trade depression Poverty was rife and it is difficult to follow why more bank ruptcies did not occur and what the general merchants found to live upon. Land owners suffered badly and most of them increased their indebtedness. The departure of the South Persia Eifles removed what had been a great stimulus to local trade while the flactuations of exchange made foreign trade highly speculative. The exchange which may be taken as 865 as a normal rate for Rupees 100 but which had fallen to 20 during the war, reached 403 during the summer and made trade purchases from India impos sible. The average for the year was about 375. The value of carpets exported amounted to £103,205. The imports to Kcrman town through Bandar Abbas amounted to about £208,50 &gt;, the chief item consi^tiag of piece goods which accounted for £138,247 of the total, haberdashery was about 16,500, tea 6,500, sugar 2,400 and kerosine oil 4,300. The import trade remains mainly in the hands of Hindus. The Orient Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, a company registered in London with a capital of £1,000,000, having its head office in Smyrna with Offices at the leading capitals controls the greater part of the carpet trade. The manager is Mr. J. Joannides assisted by a staff of Europeans mainly from Smyrna or the Greek islands. The British Consulate also protects the American firms of:— Messrs. S. K. M. Guelofiantz, Messrs. H. S. Tavshanjian, Messrs. A. &amp; M. Karagheueian, tepresented by Armenians in Kerman. The Swiss Trading Company closed down during the year as they were unable to make profits and pay expenses. The Swiss firm of Messrs. A. E. Wetli still continues and is represented by the owner or his brother^ Mr. A. WetlL1 persian gulf political residency, 1922. British Interests.

He was assisted at Headquarters by a staff consisting of 5 Europeans and 9 Armenians and others. The following is a list of stations in the District at which messages are accepted, with names of telephone control stations :— Southern Sub-Division. Kerman Sub-Division. Frontier Sub-Division.

Kushkuh It would appear advisable to accept messages at Rafsinjan in place of Anar and to transfer the telephone station of Rafsinjan to Anar. Rafsinjan is a place of considerable commercial importance having a large through traffic of a nature which would give rise to telegraphic work whereas messages would comparatively rarely be received at Anar. Imperial Bank op Persia. Mr. F. A. Ayrton held charge of the post of Manager till he was relieved by Mr. Charles Gardner, in the month of January. He has an assistant, an accountant, charge being held by Mr. C. B. Francis. It was a bad year for Banking owing to the depression of trade following on two bad harvests. Imports dropped considerably while Auction in exchange made foreign trade a gamble. Church Missionary Society. Dr. C. M. Schaffter has remained in charge of the Mission Hospital. He is assisted in the Medical Mission by Dr. (Miss) Westlake with Miss Petley and Miss Seagrave as Nurses, and a local staff of five men attendants and three women. The Rev. A. K. Boy land was in charge of the Church and the Mission Boys' School until bis departure near the close of the year when Miss Aidin took over temporary charge of the school. The Girls' School is in the charge of Miss Stewart and Miss Stratton is in charge of Children's Welfare. Consular Proceedings. The total number of cases settled by the Karguzari in conjunction with the Consulate in which the interests of Foreign subjects and of British pro tected Persian subjects were concerned was 42 and the compensation recovered amounted to Rs. 65,059-55. 55 cases were pending at the end of the year. No criminal cases were dis posed of during the year. L.

Administration Report of the Mekran Coast for the year 1922. Versonal* —Mr. E. E. Gunter, O.B.E., was in Political charge of the Mekran Coast up to 30th March when he proceeded to England on leave. In his absence, his duties were performed by Mr. T. P. Tebbnt. Mr. Gunter returned fronv leave on the 24ith November and reassumed charge on that date. Gun-Burning. —158 Service rifles, 15 pistols, one double barrelled shot gun and 26,800 rounds of ammunition were reported landed at the ports of the Persian Baluchistan by Arab and Mekran dhows. A comparison with the number of arms landed last year shows that there has been some decrease in this trade during the year. Fersim Baluchistan. —The country has been somewhat quieter than usual. The chief events of the year are given below In March Mir Mohamed AH a follower of Mir Yahya Khan of Bint was murdered by Dad Pahman Dilmurad at Papch. Mir Yahya with the brother of the deceased and a following attacked Dad Pahman. During the affray one man was killed on each side and Yahya Khan was wounded. Bahram Pind (the eldest of the Pind brothers) went to Turbat and met Mr. Packman on 26th June but his attitude was the reverse of submissive and he refused an invitation to meet the Political Agent, Kalat in Panjgur in July and returned across the bordei. During the latter half of May reports were current that some thousands of Persian horsemen had left for the Baluchistan frontier. This caused much apprehension. The reports, however, proved to be groundless. Durin g the year parties of men from Persian Baluchistan twice raided Nigore in Gwadur territory carrying off in all 27 camels and one child. Khalifa Khair Mohamed wrote a conciliatory letter to the Director asking pardon for ^11 his misdeeds and promising to be on friendly terms with the Government in future. He was recommended for pardon by the Pesident to the Government of India who were pleased to grant the same. The message was duly communicated to the Khalifa by the Assistant Superintendent in charge of the Jask Telegraph Sub-Division. Claims. —None of the old claims made by the British Indian subjects against the chiefs and people of the Persian Baluchistan were settled during the year. Foreign subjects, —No subjects of any foreign European powers resided at the ports of the Mekran during the year. were interrupted 18 hours. 83 „ 25 „ 7 „ 126 hours in the Kara wan district.

All went to Karachi; 33 of them at Government expense. Reports were received during the year, of 50 slaves from Persian Baluchistan being exported to the Arab Coast for sale. In some cases, arms and ammuni tion were purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the slaves. In April the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf came to Charbar in H. M. S. Cyclamen and interviewed Sirdar Husain Khan, Mirs Yahya Khan, Mahnmd Khan and Din Mohamed at Charbar and asked them to stop arms and slave traffic in the country under their jurisdiction. Mir Yahya Khan o-ave a solemn undertaking 'n writing to the Commander of H. M. S. Cyclamen to do this. Sirdar Husain Khan expressed his willingness to co-operate with us in stopping the traffic and to give the same in writing but left for Gaih suddenly on 6th May without giving it. Mir Din Mohamed Khan promised to stop the traffic in his district. 4 Tour. —The Director left Karachi for a tour of inspection on the 6th Feb ruary and after visiting all the telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf returned to headquarters on the 22nd March. On the down trip he interviewed Mirs Din Mohamed Khan and Mahmud Khan at Charbar. Mr. J. S. Navarra, Assistant Superintendent of the Jask Sub-Division telegraph line, left on his annual inspection of the lines between Jask and Gwadur on the 25th November under the escort consisting of one British Officer and 50 rifles of the 126th Baluchistan Infantry from Karachi. His report on the condition of the country between Biyaban aud Gwadur is appended. XI-3034 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE J ask. Mr. W. S.

Hannah, General Service Clerk, was in charge of the Telegraph Station up to 26th May. He was then relieved by Mr. H. D. Thoy, M. B. E,, Assistant Superintendent. Persian Customs. — Mr. Simen performed the duties of the Collector of Customs during the year. The subsidy paid to the Chiefs for the protection of the customs was stopped by the orders of the Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas during the first quarter of the year. Mir Din Mohamed threatened to turn the Collector of Customs out of Charbar if the subsidy was not paid. While negotiations were going on between Charbar and Bunder Abbas on this qnestion, D Sirdar Husain Khan accompanied by Brahim Khan, uncle of Dost Mohamed of Bampur, arrived at Bir to collect taxes. Husain Khan wished to come into Charbar but Din Mohamed with two hundred armed men took up his stand at Tez near Charbar to prevent his entry. Dm Mohamed was nnally prevailed upon to allow Husain Khan to come into Charbar with small follow ing Mirs Mamud Khan and Yahya Khan also arrived. Brahim Khan on behalf of Husain Khan claimed 50 per cent, of the subsidy but no settlement was arrived at. Husain Khan and Yahya Khan left Charbar after a short stay. After much delay the Karguzar with the Inspector of Customs, Southern Ports came to Charbar in the Persepolis, An agreement was made between Din Mohamed and the Inspector of Customs by virtue of which 80 per cent, of the subsidy was to be paid to Din Mohamed under certain conditions and JU per cent, to Mahmud Khan. No subsidy is to be paid to Husain Khan or Yahva Khan. After the settlement of the affair the Karguzar left Charbar on the 25th May. On the 20th November, the Collector of Customs, Charbar* again received instructions from Bunder Abbas to stop payments as the Central Customs Administration at Teheran disapproved of the Karguzar s settlement. The subsidy was however paid on 10th January 1923. fPalis, Shahdad and Chakar were Mahmud Khan's Walis of Charbar during the year. Sher Mohamed acted as Din Mohamed's Wali. Military Detachment,— Ithz average strength^ of the detachment stationed here was one British Officer, one Indian Officer and 50 infantry men. Royal 'Navy. —H. M. S. Cyclamen and Jfispiegle and E. I. M. S. Lawrence called at Charbar during the year. t Visits.

Earman All from the establishment of the Political Agent, Kalat acted as British Agent during his absence.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922, 35 jfali. —Saif bin Badar the Wali returned from leave during the month of May. Customs. —Mohamed Tewfiq was transferred to Muscat in August on relief by Sikander Effendi. No friction has taken place between the traders and the Customs officials regarding the payment of the custom duties. A shed to store cargo landed from the vessels is under construction. Smallpox. —following Cholera which appeared at Gwadur in^ September 1921, the town was visited by a severe epidemic of smallpox. His Highness the Sultan of Muscat was asked through the Political Agent at that place to send a vaccinator, but one was not available. Sufficient lymph which was paid for by the Sultan's Treasury was despatched to Gvradur and the work of inoculating was done by the Munshi of the British Agency who had had some experience while serving in Mekran. He performed the^ work satisfac torily and was rewarded Rs. 20 by the Sultan. The disease died out in June. It is reported that no less than 1,251 persons succumbed. GWADUR. Biyahan District. —Bahadur-a-Sultan Mir Birkat is Zabit of the District and the method of his administration has been satisfactory. He, and Mirza Khan (also called Zargam-a-Naizam) of Eudbar are now on better terms than in the year 1921. Mir Barkat's relations with us continued to be very cordial and recently he wrote a strong letter to Naghdie Khan condemning his behavior towards the British Government for the damage he did to the telegraph lines m the Kara^van District some time in May 1922. There has been no report regarding any trouble with the Minabies and therefore I understand that here too he has exercised his influence in getting* the tribes to be more on friendly terms. Jask District. —This District is managed as before by Mir Mustapha Khan and his son Mir Morad. The junior sons also control certain other sections of the District. The management during the year under report has been ever so much more satisfactory than in 1921. This is more or less due to Mir Barkat assisting Mir Mustapha Khan and strengthening his power. On the whole the Biyaban and Jask District up to Malekani Ohiddack is administered satisfactorily and most of the tribes people are inenuly inclined towards us. Bint District. —Since Islam Khan's death this District has suffered badly through efficiency of proper administration. The sons of Islam -^-han Mirs Yahya and Ayoub (former subsidised) claim to be the rulers of the whole District between Bandani and Malekani Chiddak. Mir Naghdi Khan disre- gards this ideal and claims that half the District that is from Surag o Malekani Chiddak near Sadaich is under his administration Prom all accounts and reports 1 have received, this seems to be correct. Even Sirdar Husam Khan agrees to Naghdie Khan's statement. On this account^ Naghdie Khan claims a subsidy for protecting the line through his district, and since he gets no subsidy he leaves the telegraph line open to damage by tribesmen. In me recent damage done to the line in May 1922, although he was actually on the spot, a man by name of Sowab a relative of Sirdar Husam Khan carried out the destruction work. From other reports I have heard that the work was done at Naghdie Khan's instigation. M ir Yahya at that time was at Charbar and could do nothing. The only person that assisted was Mahmad A1 lie Khan, a sensible young petty chief, who seems to have some influence over iN agndie K-han. E. E. GUNTEU, Director, Persian Oulf Section Indo-European Telegraph Department t in Political Charge Mekran Coast,S6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE In November 1922, Naghdie Khan obstructed us again by detaining the camel caravan from passing through his district, and here too Mahmad Allie E han gave every possible assistance. I had an interview with Mahmad Allie Khan at Sadaicli on the 16th December. He shewed signs of being friendly inclined and has assured me that he will continue to give every possible assistance and be loyal to the British Government. His views with regard to Naghdie Khan's behavior is that unless Yahya's subsidy is equally divided between them he will never rest and will continue to give us trouble again. It has been reported to me that Yahya was also responsible for the detention of our camels at Surag and that both Naghdie Khan and Yahya were on the best of terms when they were collecting revenues in the Karawan District. Mir Yahya also gave out that if his subsidy was not paid him within a week he would commence a general destruction of the telegraph lines throughout his district. This has been confirmed by several men who were on the spot. It distinctly proves that Yahya is not as loyal as he poses. In matter of fact I think that Yahya and Naghdie Khan are both in league and are working for an increase in the subsidy of this District. The experiment should however be tried in dividing the subsidy and see how matters will work. A present of Eupees 75 sanctioned for services rendered was paid to Mahmad Allie Khan, who seemed satisfied and pleased. The Khalipha, who is at Panuj now, has given no trouble. He is afraid to come and see me. I have verbally informed him through my informer ; that the British Government has pardoned him for his past misdeeds and he must not expect a subsidy as he is an Afghan subject and neither a chief nor a headman of the District. He seems to be reconciled. Generally speaking of this district, the administration of it is carried out in a very unsatisfactory manner and most of the tribesmen with petty headmen complain of the District having no strong and proper ruler and that they are very unjustly and cruelly treated by the present chiefs. Geh District. —This District is managed by Sirdar Husain Khan as before. So far there has been no trouble and the telegraph lines from Bandani to Charbar are well protected. Over the Charbar Customs Allowance Sardars Husain Khan and Din Mahomed almost came to blows but latter showed no fear and for the protection of Charbar he took up his position at Tez. Some how the fight was avoided and after some discussion Sirdar Husain Khan returned to Geh. I think Sirdar Dostmahomed of Bampur intervened in this matter since both these chiefs are closely related through marriage. Sirdar Husain Khan having married Dostmahomed's daughter in 1922 and Din Mahomed Dostmahomed's sister some years back. Since this relationship between Hu^ain Khan and Dostmahomed exists, Husain Khan does nothing without his father-in-law's advice. His position they say is also much streng thened. Dashtyari District — Sirdar Din Mahomed Khan and Mahmood Khan are still chieftains of the District. Their administration seems to be satisfactory. The former seems more powerful of the two and they appear to be loyal to the British Government. Sirdar Din Mahomed visited India some time in August last and also took a trip to Quetta. He seemed very pleased with the treat ment he received by the authorities of the British Government throughout his journey. Before leaving for Gharbar he visited me and expressed his loyalty towards the Government and promised to give every possible assist ance for the protection of the telegraph lines through the District. Bahu District.—M.\vs Soban Khan and Ahmed Khan are still in control of the District and are managing it quite satisfactorily. They have behaved quietly and uninterferingly and treat their subjects with kindness and justice. Mir Soban visited India during the year under report. General. —There has been no satisfactory amount of rainfall up to Decem ber 1922 and famine conditions still appear to be imminent. When the inspection party commenced work great water difficulties were experienced in places up to Kapch the 26th December 1922 when heavy rain fell throughout the Mekran Coast. The anti-British feeling is ever so much better now also the political situ ation seems satisfactory and most of the chiefs with the exception of the Karawan lot are friendly inclined.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 3^ CHAPTER V. Administration Report of the Mohammerah Vice-Consulate for the year 1922. JP btsowyiqI . Assistant Surgeon 0. H.

Principal events. —His Excellency the Shaikh accompanied by his sons, the Governor-General, the Karguzar, and a number of leading local merchants proceeded to Basrah to pay their homage to His Imperial Majesty the Shah who arrived there at the beginning of Eebruary en route to Europe. The Shah embarked at Basrah and regretted that he was unable to accept the Shaikh's invitation to come to Mohammerah. The Shaikh's Palace was gaily decorated for the occasion and as the B. I- Steamer passed down river, several motor launches followed in procession for a short distance. The Shaikh's Battery fired a salute. At Basrah His Imperial Majesty bestowed several decorations and titles on the Shaikh, his sons, the Governor-General and others. The Shaikh held a Durbar at his Palace the next day in honour of the high decoration of Taj-i-Kian w T hich was bestowed on him.. EUs Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul and the heads of British firms were invited, and attended the investiture, which was conducted by the Governor-General. His Boyal Highness the Crown Prince of Persia arrived at Mohammerah from Europe on the 25th May, and was the guest of His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah, who entertained His Royal Highness in right royal fashion. His Royal Highness was perfectly satisfied with all the arrange ments made for his reception. One of the principal events during the year was the dismissal of Shaikh Abdul Maj id. Third son of His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah, from the Deputy-Governorship of Mohammerah. He proved an utter failure and was totally unfit for the post and there was no doubt that he was bringing his father into disrepute. His unfitness reached its climax when he subjected British and British Protected subjects to his tyrannies and he even went as far as having one of the clerks employed by The Anglo-Persian Oil GompanVj Limited, a British subject, beaten. The matter was at once taken up seriously by the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who demanded his immediate dismissal. He made himself very unpopular and was thoroughly hated by the local inhabitants, and his many mean actions and cruelties will be remembered. A section of Indian, Persian and Arab workmen numbering about two thousands, employed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, at tne Abadan Refinery, went on strike on the 14th March. A Committee of Workmen was formed and the whole affair well organised. This so-called Committee made certain demands chiefly for increase in wa §^» which were unjustifiable. The men were advised to continue at their work. After several discussions and on their refusing to resume work, the Oil Company decided to repatriate all, as they had broken their contracts, inePERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 39 men demanded to be sent away togethei r and refused to embark in different steamers. It was considered necessary to obtain assistance from the Military authorities at Basrah to safe-guard the Company's interests. H. M. S. Cyclamen arrived with the Hon'ble the Political Eesident from Bushire and the Shaikh of Mohammerah was summoned from Koweit to settle the local Arabs and Persians. The Navy and Military successfully embarked the strikers and normal conditions prevailed after a few days. Passports restrictions imposed between Mohammerah and Basrah came into force from the 20th July. A special clerk from Iraq was detailed to do the work at the Consulate at Mohammerah. This has caused the public much displeasure and the Shaikh of Mohammerah is strongly opposed to it and has .made several protests against the restrictions. Shaikh Chassib Khan, Sardar Arfaa, eldest son of His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah, proceeded to England at the end of November. He was very ill during the summer months and was advised by a good many doctors to take a trip to and undergo treatment in England. He is supposed to be away for six months. The Shaikh has allowed him £300 per mensem for his expenses. Haji Ebrahim, Ex-Tax Collector of this town declared himself insolvent, attributing the reason to Shaikh Chassib's exactions. He owed the Shaikh about tomans 12,000 which he was unable to pay; so was dismissed and imprisoned. A^ha Karoon, who is the present Collector, appears to have gained the confidence of the Shaikh and things appear to be working smoothly. Agha Ardi, who for several years was Deputy Governor of Mohammerah and Tax Collector, was appointed Deputy Governor of Hindijan and Zaidan, in June. It is regretted to have to report the death of Darya Begi, which occurred on the 18th September. The deceased was Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports for a good many years. He was the best friend of the British and always rendered most valuable assistance to the British Government; especially during the war. He was afraid of going to the interior of Persia on account of the anti- British feeling prevailing at the time, so decided to make his abode with the Shaikh at Eeiliyeh. Posts and Telegraphs.— T \ iq British Posts and Telgraph Offices carried on their work during the year. M. Arjumond, the new Director of Persian Post Offices in Arabistan arrived at Mohammerah on the 16th December, with three clerks, and took over postal charge from the Director of Customs who was also Director of Persian Post Offices. Customs, —Monsieur Andrieux was Director of Customs during the first few months of the year. He handed over charge on his retirement on the 16th April to Monsieur Cordonnier who had arrived from Ahwaz, and proceeded to Europe. Monsieur Cordonnier has started by making several improvements. The Central Administration telegraphed instructions that all employees of the Customs should wear uniforms as a precaution against outsiders feigning as Customs officers and misusing the authority. The summer uniform is a white tunic with a green collar and the winter one is a blue serge with a green collar. Stars on the collar and stripes on the sleeves of the tunic denote the seniority of respective officers. Smuggling of krans to Basrah was carried on to a great extent and the Customs made a lot of money by confiscating large sums. Local Folice—lh.e Local Police Eorce^ still continues; but is not as efficient now as it was a year or so ago, Haji Izzat Effendi is still head of the force and carries out his duties satisfactorily, in spite of the many obstacles.40 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE Adliyeh. —This department ceases to exist at present and all minor cases are referred to and tried by the head of Police. Baladiyeh. —Agha Karoon now holds the appointment of Rais and so far is taking an interest in the sanitation of the Town. Consular Escort. —Two local Persians are maintained as Guards during the day, and the Shaikh arranged for ghulams 4 as night guards. British interests, —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. Consider able progress has been made with extensions in Abadan throughout the year. The dangerous oil loading tanks and jetties in Bawarda, two miles below Abadan, are now complete and this unit is in commission. The Company is now in a position to deal more expeditiously with the export of all products. Important new units have been laid down and will be in full working^ commis sion within the next few months. Two serious interruption^ impeded the progress of work at the Eefinery during the year. The first was the strike among Indian skilled labourers, which resulted in the dismissal of over two thousand Indian artizans. These men were replaced mainly by Persians whom the Company has been train ing gradually. The progress, however, has been slow and has meant inevitable delay to the completion of extensions. The second interruption was a fire which occurred in Noyember. The actual amount of material damage was small, about £25,000; but some of the finishing plant was destroyed and the out-put of refined products has been curtailed. The producing area has been steadily increased. Additional test wells have been put-out beyond the proved areas which are now being operated. Extensive testing operations are being carried out in a number of other parts of the territory covered by the Persian concessions; most of which give promise of favourable results. The pipe-line capacity and pumping stations have been increased. The Company's distributing organisations in Iraq and Persia have been developed. Messrs. St rich, Scott fy Co,, Ltd. —This Company has continued its work as Managing Agents of The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, throughout the year. Several new houses have been built for the Staff, which now numbers about thirty-five Europeans. There is now a motor car service between Mohammerah and Abadan. The Imperial Bank of Persia. —This Bank carried on its work during the year. Mr. Murray was Manager at the beginning of the year and was succeeded by Mr. Couser, who was Manager until September, when he was transferred to the North, and was relieved by Mr. W. N. Cuthbert at the end of October. The Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited. —Mr. L. S. Parsons was Deputy Manager of this firm until the beginning of May when he was trans ferred and handed over charge to Mr. W. G. Melville, who carried on the work until early November when he severed his connection with the firm and was relieved by Mr. J Marshall. Quarantine and Health. —Assistant Surgeon C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., held the appointment of Quarantine Medical Ofiicer from the beginning of the year until he proceeded on five months' leave, when the work was carried on by Dr. A. Dias, M.B.C.B., L.R.C.P., the Shaikh's doctor. On return from leave he resumed charge. The Charitable Dispensary in the town continues to be well attended, C. H. LINCOLN, Mis Britannic Majesty*s Acting Vice-Consul, Mohammerah.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY. 1923. 41 CHAPTER VI. Annual Administration Report of the Ahwaz Consulate, 1922. Personnel* —Mr, B. G. B. Peel continued to hold the post of Consul, Ahwaz, until March 28th when he was relieved by Mr. J. A. O. Pitzpatrick, C.I.K.j C.B.E., I.C.S. He resumed charge from Mr. Eitzpatriok on return from leave on the 11th December 1922. Captain 0. Wallis, Vice-Consul, Dizful, made Ahwaz his headquarter 8 during the Consul's summer tour. Captain E. H. Gastrell, I.A., assumed charge as Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, on the 11th November 1922. Mr. Rahmatullah Khan, Head Clerk, proceeded on long leave on 1st May 1922 and was relieved by Mr. Sher Zaman Khan, Head Clerk of the Dizful 'Vice-Consulate. The latter continued to hold the post until the end of the year. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Mehdi Hassan was awaiting orders of posting at the end of the year, the Ahwaz Civil Hospital and Charitable Dispensary having been permanently closed in the meantime under orders from the Gov ernment of India. The Hon'ble the Political Resident, Bushire had proposed in May 1922 that the status of Consulate for Arabistan should be conferred on the Consu late at Ahwaz and that Mohammerah should henceforward be a Vice-Con sulate. This proposal was sanctioned by the Government of India with effect from 23rd September 1922. Ahwaz and district. —No events worth chronicling occurred. Dizful and Shushtar. —In the last Administration Report it was explained that on the arrival of His Excellency Zahir-ul-Mulk (now styled Moayyed-ed- Dowleh) as Governor-General of Arabistan all direct control of the Persian Ad ministrative Departments in Dizful and Shushtar had been relinquished by His Britannic Majesty's Consular representatives. The latter w r ere ordered to res trict their activities to the protection of purely British interests and to the ren dering of such moral support to the Governor-General as he might require in maintaining law and order in the district. In the light of subsequent events, there is little doubt that His Excellency Moayyed-ed-Dowleh and his Deputy Governor at Dizful-Mirza Abdullah Khan came to Arabistan with the fixed determination to contest the supremacy of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and to minimise British influence in Arabistan to the greatest possible extent. The first difficulty arose over the support of Earhan Chief of the A1 Kathir by the Governor-General against the authority of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. This episode aroused in the Sheikh suspicions of the good faith of Moayyed-ed- Powleh and also brought home to the latter the fact that he was able to do very little within his own jurisdiction without coming into direct conflict with the interests of the Sheikh. A difficult situation was created for the Vice-Consul at Dizful by the Deputy Governor's sudden arrest of Sadiq Khan, Chief of the Sagwand tribe who had for some years drawn a large subsidy from the British Government. A strong official protest secured his release but this episode was the signal for the commencement of a series of intrigues among the tribal leaders in the Dizful district which at last necessitated the resignation of the Governor-General. It was unfortunate that just prior to this event the Head Munshi of the Dizful Vice-Consulate was proved to have committed serious extortions extending over a period of years. He was dismissed after a full enquiry held at Dizful by His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, and was handed over to the Persian authorities for settlement of such claims as had been proved against him. P-3Q ^42 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE His ExcellencyMoayyed-ed-Dowleh had set his hopes on securing a consider able detachment of regular troops from the Persian Government. With these he hoped to make his own position secure in North Arahistan and to overawe the Sheikh of Mohammerah into paying his arrears of revenue in full. His request for troops coincided with the determination of ihe Minister of 'War to bring Arabistan under his own control. In spite of representations by His Britannic Majesty's Minister in Teheran and a definite promise from the Prime Minister that troops would not be sent to Arabistan where their arrival was likely to be the signal for serious tribal disturbances, a detachment of 400 men with guns and machine guns left Isfahan for Arabistan in July. They were attacked by a number of Kuhgilus at Shalil in the Bakhtiari country and suffered heavy casualties. The remnant after being looted of all their arms and ammunition made their way back to Isfahan. The Bakhtiari Khans and the Sheikh of Mohammerah denied all knowledge of the attack but it is doubtful -whether their sfatements are believed in Teheran. By the middle of September the Governor-General found his position im possible. He had quarrelled with everyone of any importance and after his residence in Dizful had been subjected to several bursts of rifle fire he telegraphed to the Acting Consul at Ahwaz asking that the Consulate motor car flying a small Union Jack might be sent for him and that he might be accompanied out of the town by the Head Clerk of the Dizful Vice-Consulate. The request was granted. An interregnum ensued during which the Sheikh of Mohammerah appointed his own agents to maintain order in Dizful and Shushtar until the arrival of the new Governor-General His Excellency Mushar-ed-Dowleh. The latter has pursued an entirely different policy from that of his predecessor and the towns people aud tribesmen alike seem perfectly contented with his rule. Bahhtiari. —Before leaving for the South in the early spring the Khans chose Amir Mufakham as Illkhani and Sirdar Zaffar as Illbegi thus reverting to the principle that the government! should be vested in the most senior Khan of each of the two ruling families. In the Illkhani family Samsam-es- Sultaneh is of course senior to Sirdar Zaffar but as the former has eliminated himself from Bakhtiari politics and has delegated his authority to his son Murteza Qnli Khan the principle is not really violated by Sirdar Zaffar's appointment as Illbegi. Except for an important agreement signed by the Khans with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company under which the Khans received a substantial loan in return for the deposit of their share scrip with the Company, little worth chronicling has occurred in Bakhtiari during the year under report. The Khans still appear to be quite incapable of adjusting their family differences in a friendly manner and for this reason are unable to present a united front to the centralising activities of the Minister of War. They have lost all their outside governorships including even the Government of the Kuhgilu country which is now administered by a Governor appointed direct by the Persian Government. During the visit to the Oilfields in May 1922, they concluded a written agreement with the Sheikh of •Mohammerah the gist of which is as follows r— (a) The contracting parties to cooperate in every respect. (5) The contracting parties bind themselves to serve the Persian Government faithfully and loyally. (c) Any previous agreement between the contracting parties which may be produced subsequent to the present agreement to be considered null and void. (d) The present agreement to be binding on the descendants of the contracting parties. The importance of this document is that it waives the longstanding claim of the Bakhtiari Khans to a share in the A1 Kathir properties of Dizful and Shushtar and in the lands of the late Nizam-es-Sultaneh.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 43 At the moment of writing (February 1923) the Illkhani and Illbegi have resigned and haye left for Teheran in the hope of composing their family differences there. Lynch Road.—^he average rate of mule hire from Ahwaz to Isfahan was Krans 9*80 per Shah Maund as compared with Krans 12'35 in 1921. The maximum rate of hire paid in 1922 was Krans 13 per Shah Maund as asainst Krans 16 in 1921. The decrease in the volume of trade carried on this road is shown by the fact that the caravans of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation conveyed only 3271J cwt. in 1922 compared with 5125J cwt. in 1921 and 9980 cwt. in 1920. Medical. —The Civil Hospital was closed down in March 1922 and the Charitable Dispensary, which had been temporarily resuscitated pending the final orders of the Government of India in November of the same year. Efforts are being made to organize a town dispensary under the charge of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon until recently in the employ of the Government of India, supported by public funds. Arrangements have been made for the free treatment of the Consulate staff at the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's hospital at Ahwaz. Anglo-Fersian Oil Company. —The expansion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's activities is too well known to require detailed description here. With regard to labour conditions the Eields Manager writes as follows :— ' It has always been our endeavour to make use of the labour of this y country as far as possible and we have-found in the past that for Pipe Line work and drilling the native has no equal. With a view to encouraging the native for other jobs an apprenticeship system has been started for the training of Persian labour in the various trades and the results are so far very satisfactory indeed. The apprentices in the trade testing shops are making excellent progress and we trust that in the next few years we shall be in a position to run our various departments with local artizan labour which will have been trained in our own shops and to our own standard of efficiency. Last year the percentage of Indian labour was 9 per cent, of the total—a decrease of 2 per cent, compared with the year 1920 and it is our intention eventually, to eliminate indentured labour from India exce'pt for a few of the better type who may be required for special work.' E. G. B. PEEL, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Arahistan, Ahwaz.46 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CHAPTER VII. Administration Report, Muscat Agency, 1922. His Highness the Sultan, Saiyid Taimnr was absent in India at the close of 1921 and some doubts were entertained of his returning to Muscat. These doubts proved to be groundless. The delay in His Highness' return was due to his wife's ill-health. His Highness returned to Muscat on 9th March and remained till 15th May. He returned to Muscat again on 14th December with the intention of staying three months. During his stay at Muscat he evinced interest in the affairs of his state and gave directions to his Ministers on various points for the improvement of the administration. Saiyid Said, the eldest son of the Sultan, joined the Mayo College in January and is enjoying his life there and doing well at his work. The Council of Ministers remains unchanged fin personnel and has con tinued to function much as before. It is much handicapped by the fact that two of its members are the head-quarter judges of religious and civil cases respectively. Both for their sakes and for the sake of the people generally the appointment of other judges is necessary but cannot be carried out immediately for lack of funds. The delay in obtaining justice, due in part to the lack of judges and in part to the pressure on the time of the existing judges of the claims of British subjects and proteges, is the chief evil of the administration at head-quarters. The Government of Sohar and its Customs were brought under the Central Government in the beginning of April, but the control of the central government was extremely ineffective up to the close of the year. Saiyid Hamad, the Governor, has no intention of submitting to control more than can be helped. Both the Sultan and the Council of Ministers^ shirk tackling him. He is a clever man with progressive ideas on some subjects but is an oppressive ruler. The relations between the Muscat Government and the Omanis have been good on the whole. At the beginning of the year there was trouble over the Bani Battash tribe. This was mentioned in last year's report. ^ Correspon dence about it continued between the Political Agent and Shaikh Isa bin Salih for several months, It was finally ended by a threat to re-impose penal zakat. Of the tribes under the Sultan's jurisdiction two, the Bani Bu Ali and the Yal Saad, brought themselves to notice by rebellious conduct. The trouble with the Bani Bu Ali has not so far been serious and seems to be dying out. The paramount shaikhs got a false idea of their importance, gave some trouble about the Customs at Sur and laid claim to independence. The insubordina tion of the Yal Saad was much more serious. In January they prevented the establishment of a customs post at Khadra and burnt one which had been established at Wadam. Peaceful efforts to bring them to reason failed and the Muscat Government rapidly lost all authority in their country. The Muscat Government appealed to the Government of India for naval assistance. This was sanctioned and after full warning action was taken against the Yal Saad in October. The forts of the Muscat Government at Masna'ah and Luwaiq were garrisoned by detachments of the Muscat Levy Corps and a repre-' sentative of the Muscat Government conducted negotiations from Luwaiq. In spite of three bombardments of Khadra and the seizure of several dhows, the Yal Saad refused to submit until the assembly of three ships and a threat of heavy bombardment on land convinced them that further resistance ^ was inadvisable. A fine was levied from them and Customs posts were established at Khadra and Wudam. The indications are that a satisfactory and lasting settlement has been reached, and is hoped that the slave trade in kxd-spersian gulf political residency, 1922. ^ napped Baluchis, of which, the Yal Saad country has always been the centre, has been checked for a time. Poreign interests are for the present practically extinct in Muscat. The famous French firm of Gozuyer closed all their affairs in Muscat during the first few months of the year. Ibrahim Elbaz, nephew of the founder of the firm of Gozuyer, left with his cousins in May. His affairs are not entirely settled but it is believed he will not return. Of the French flag holders not more than four remain. Monsieur Vadala, the late French Consul at Bombay, who had charge of French affairs at Muscat gave it as his opinion in January 1922 that France would relinquish all interest in Muscat in a year or two. The French sloop Bellatrix visited Muscat in February in the course of a cruise round the Arabian sea and the Gulfs of Oman and Persia. She is practically a sister ship to His Majesty's sloops on the Persian Gulf stations. There were no unusual features connected with her visit. She was supplied with Admiralty coal from the Muscat Depot. The Muscat Levy Corps continues to be very satisfactory. Captain E. C. McCarthy continued to hold command throughout the year. The Seistani were all discharged during the year and replaced by men from Muscat, Matra and Gwadar. The Corps was inspected at the end of the year by Colonel H. H. Smith, D.S.O., Commanding Troops in the Gulf Ports. He reported very favourably on the Corps and on the work of Captain McCarthy and the Indian officers. Major M. E. Rae continued to be Political Agent and His Majesty's Consul throughout the year. The post of Agency Surgeon continued vacant. The 27th February 1923, M. E. KAE.48 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CHAPTER VIII. Administration Report of Trucial Coast for the year 1922. Khan Sahib Isabin Abdul Latif held charge of the office of Residency A^ent on the Trucial Coast throusrhout Genera1 ' the year. The principalities of Shargah and Bas-el-Khaimah were disturbed by events at Hamriyah and Earns, but affairs on the rest of the Trucial Coast were in the main quiet. Slave Trade.—A considerable traffic in Baluchis continues between the Batineh Coast of Oman, and also the Trucial Coast. Early in May the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast were all warned by the Eesident of the importance attached by the Government of India to the suppression of this traffic, and the necessity for the Sheikhs to co-operate. This warning was subsequently confirmed by letter. The Sheikhs all promised to co-operate to the best of their ability. The Sheikh of Shargah possibly.on account of his town being the Besidency Agent's head-quarters has co-operated best, but the other Sheikhs are rather half hearted owing to the leading men being opposed to the suppression of the traffic. The Residency Agent has, however, been able to recover a good many Baluchis sold at Debai and Abu Dhabi, and a consider able number have been repatriated. Some progress has been made towards checking the traffic, and purchasers try and secure themselves from loss of the purchase money by clauses in deeds of sale. The peace of the Shargah principality was disturbed by events at Hamriyah, a village under the suzerainty of the Shargah ' Sheikh of Shargah, the headmen of which have from time to time endeavoured to secede. About the middle of December 1921, Humaid, the son of the Headman Abdur Rahman, during the absence of his father at Shargah, seized Hamriyah and proclaimed its independence of Shargah. The Resident happened to visit Shargah the day after this and at the request of the Sheikh went to Hamriyah with the latter with a view to arbitrating in the matter. Humaid, however, refused to come off to the ship, and a shamal (N. W. Wind) having sprung up gave him a good excuse for not doing so and also made it necessary for the Lawrence to leave. After this the Residency Agent made several efforts to settle the matter amicably but failed. The Senior Naval Officer subsequently visited Shargah and Hamriyah but Humaid refused to see him although given a safe conduct. The Senior Naval Officer therefore gave him 14 days in which to make his peace with the Sheikh. The matter really concerned the Shargah Principality, but the dispossessed Headman had been installed under the Sheikh of Shargah by negotiations carried out by one of His Majesty's Ships, the previous dispute had lasted for months and reacted unfavourably on the pearling industry, and finally the Sheikh and Headman both ^ earnestly asked for the assistance of the Residency to save protracted fighting and some bloodshed. These considerations coupled with the fact that the time given by the Senior Naval Officer had expired and the truculent attitude adopted b^ Humaid to that officer and to the Resident made it necessary to take some^ action. Ac cordingly the Resident visited Hamriyah on the 17th Pebruary in R. I. M. S. Lawrence accompanied by the Sheikh of Shargah and Headman Abdur Rahman and made great efforts through the Residency Agent and the Munshi to get Humaid to visit the ship to make some arrangement, but he was obdurate. In the end he had to be informed that if he did not come to the ship one of His Majesty's Ships would be called in to deal with him. On the 18th February H. M. S. Cyclamen arrived and Humaid having declined to come off and sent a temporizing letter, he was warned that he had better evacuate the fort if he did not intend to comply. In the afternoon a limited bombardment waspersian gulf political residency, im. 49 carried out on the fort by H. M. S. Cyclamen. This produced no sign of sub mission and in the evening the Sheikh of Shargah left for his town to collect men. The next day was Sunday and a deputation came on board asking that the Residency Agent and Munshi should go ashore and try to settle the matter amicably. This they did and the meeting lasted several hours and achieved no result. In the evening however news of the Sheikh of Shargah's pre parations got known and Humaid fled that night after dark. On the 20th February Abdur Eahman was installed by the Sheikh of Shargah who had returned during the night. Abdur Eahman was warned to be on the qui vive and both he and the Sheikh of Shargah were positive that he could hold his own. However Humaid had only gone to Umm-ul-Qaiwain and returned and recaptured Hamriyah on the 25th Eebruary with the assistance of some Bedouin. The Lawrence had by that time left the coast. However, He. M. S. Cyclamen was still there and visited Umm-ul-Qaiwain to try and settle the matter. It appeared likely that Commander Brandon would succeed in this but on the 1st March he had to leave the coast owing to a strong shamal (N. W. Wind). H. M. S. Cyclamen again visited the Trucial Coast on the 16th March to settle the matter which in the meantime had almost been settled by the Residency Agent, but had to leave the same night to go to Abadan on account of the strike there. H. M. S. Cyclamen visited the Trncial Coast a third time in connection with this case on the 10th April. Another effort to settle the case amicably was made through the Sheikh of Debai who volunteered to act as mediary. However this failed and it was decided that the only course was for H. M. S. Cyclamen to support the Sheikh of Shargah's force which would attack by land. After some delay on the part of the Sheikh's force the programme was carried out, a limited bombardment by H. M. S. Cyclamen being carried out on the 12th April. Humaid left that night and his principal followers swore obedience to the Slieikh of Shargah and Abdur Rahman who was again reinstated. For some time Humaid remained in the neighbourhood but as Hamriyah was occupied by the Shargah force, he was unable to do anything and in the end went to Baraimi where he was up to the end of the year. Since his departure practically all his adherents among the Bedouin and townspeople have made their peace with the Sheikh of Shargah. The last news of Humaid was that he was very ill at Baraimi. The affairs here were quiet. A certain number of cases of selling Baluchis were reported and in several cases the Baluchis were recovered. Nothing much occurred in Abu Dhabi until the end of August when Sheikh Sultan bin Zaid, with the assist ance of his brother. Sheikh Sagar, mur dered his full brother Sheikh Hamdan who had been Sheikh since 1912, on the ostensible ground of his oppression, and assumed the Sheikhdom in his stead. As the new Sheikh was accepted by his family and the people, his accession was recognised by the Government of India in October. The situation in this principality was disturbed by events at Rams. During 1921 Abdur Rahman, the Head man of Rams, a village near Ras-el- Khaimah and under the authority of -the Sheikh, had tried to secede, and the Shihuh, a tribe living in the neighbourhood, had helped the people of Rams and fighting had ensued. In the summer Abdur Rahman was murdered under circumstances which pointed to the complicity of the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah. Desultory fighting continued all the summer and many divers were pressed into the service and the diving industry suffered. In October the Senior Naval Officer arranged a truce for six months during which the disputes should be referred to the Resident for arbitration and the brothers of the late headman of Rams should remain at Shargah. This was the position until about the end of 1921. Daring the last few days of the year however the two brothers, Mahomtned gnid Salim, escaped and made tlieir way back to Rams via Dibba where Xl-30 050 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE they immediately received the support of the Shihu and were able to seize Hams. The Sheikh o£ Bas-el-Khaimah naturally objected to hia breach of the truce and desultory fighting ensued. As the truce had been arranged by the Senior Naval Officer it was necessary to try and settle the affair more permanently. So in February the Resident proceeded to Bas-el-Kbaimah in K. 1. M. S. Lawrence accompanied by H. M. S. Cyclamen arriving there on the 20th. The Cyclamen fetched Sheikh Ahmed Shihu from Bokha who pro mised to act as intermediary. The two ships anchored off Bams on 21st February and a safe conduct was given to the two brothers Mahommed and Salim to come off. Before they could do so however a stiff shamal arose and both ships had to leave the coast. The Bjesident had to go back to Bushire but asked the Senior Naval Officer to remain and try and effect a settlement. The Cyclamen was able to get back on the 25th February. The parties came on board but no settlement was effected that night. The next day, however, a settlement was effected after interminable arguments and Mahomed bin Saleh was appointed Headman of Earns and swore to give allegiance to Sheikh Sultan and to pay him annual tribute and to refrain from having dealings with the Shihuh. The Sheikh of Bas-al-Khaimah on his part promised to recognize Mahomed bin Saleh and not to interfere with him if he kept clear of the Shihuh. Sheikh Ahmed of Bokha, having sworn friendship to Sheikh Sultan of Bas-el-Khaimah, went to Eams and removed the Shihu. Certain questiohs of blood money were left to be settled before the Shera and this was done at Debai, the Sheikh of Bas-el-Khaimah having to pay some blood money. It is hoped that this settlement will have some degree of permanency. The Sheikh of this town, Bashid bin Ahmed, interfered a good deal ^ . in the Hamriyah affair, giving assistance mm u awam. shelter to Humaid bin Abdur Rahman. Later he promised the Commander of H. M. S. Cyclamen to bring Humaid in to make a settlement between him and his father but failed to do this. Rashid bin Ahmed died on the 22nd August of pneumonia and has been succeeded by his son Saeed. It is not yet quite certain whether Saeed will be accepted by the people of Umm-ul-Qaiwain and his succession has therefore not yet been recognized by Government. This place was quiet during the year and Sheikh Humaid behaved himself A . man very well. Presumably this is the effect of the lesson he had last year. A. P. TREYOR. B ushire; The 27th March 1923.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 51 CHAPTER IX. Administration Report of the Bahrain Political Agency for the year 1922. L I&gt;ersonnel.--Q\i&amp;rgQ of the Political Agency was held throughout the year by Major G. K. Daly, who was also in charge of the duties of the Indian Assistant, which post remained yacant. The 'Ruler of Bahrain and Al Khalifeh family. —In the early part of -Bahrain Shiah population, which had manifested itselt during 1921 against the tyranny of the ruling family continued. It had culminated in a petition presented by a representative gathering to the Hon ble the Political Resident. Shaik Abdulla, the youngest son of the ruler resented the change in his fortunes brought about by Shaik Hamad, the Heir- Apparent, having been put in to his rightful position. Abdulla continued his campaign of active local intrigue. He squandered large sums of money for that purpose and for propaganda in the Persian and Egyptian Press. In January 1922 a series of disturbances occurred at night. They were caused by a small gang who lay up on the outskirts of the town of Manameh and fired heavily on the police posts. No robberies occurred, and the sole object appeared to be that of paralysing the police force and terrorising the inhabitants. ^ Although absolute proof could not be obtained there were many indications that the affair had been instigated by Shaik Abdulla. The highly unsatisfactory behaviour of Shaik Abdulla and the continued oppression of Shiah Bahrainis, caused the Political Resident to visit Bahrain on March 7th, in the E. I. M. S. Lawrence accompanied by H. M. S. Cyclamen to deliver a warning to the Ruler. At the same time Shaik Abdulla was told that if he persisted in his intrigues Government might be compelled to take severe action. A short time previous as the result of a case of wanton oppres sion of a Bahraini, a large number of the Shaik inhabitants had made a personal protest to the Ruler and had demanded assurances of better treatment. Shaik Easa was by this time alarmed, and signed a sort of f Magna Charta ' undertaking amongst other reforms. 1. To abolish f Sakhra ' or forced labour. 2. To provide an adequate and sanitary prison. 3. To forbid the members of his family other than the heir-apparent to try cases or inflict punishment. 4. To issue written summonses for appearances in court, in lieu of the practice of suddenly arresting the required defendents and witnesses. It is a matter of regret that up to the date of this report, the Ruler has not seen fit to carry out any of his written undertakings. ^ As a result of the above mentioned warning to Shaik Abdulla he ceased his intrigues for a time. In April he and his brother Shaik Hamad considered the desirability of introducing elementary reforms and expressed a wish to learn to what extent His Majesty's Government might support their introduction, in the event of the sunni tribes declining to submit. As it was impossible for Government to foresee the extent to which they might become involved should they give any definite undertaking, it was deemed inexpedient to give any specific assurances. While the matter was still under consideration the Shaiks apparently learnt that some of the sunni tribes who would be opposed to any reforms which might place them on an equal footing with the shiahs as regards taxation, had approached the Sultan of Najd, with a view to securing his support. It was believed that the latter gave them some assurance of at least moral support. This combined with the absence of any definite assurance of support from His Majesty's Government caused tl^e Shaiks to abandon their ideas of reform.\ 52 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE Thereafter Shaik Abdulla aiopted an attitude^ of passive resistance to Shaik Hamad's authority and- taking advantage of the influence of his mother upon the Ruler, persistently frustrated all attempts of Shaik Hamad to improve the administration and to restrain unruly members of the family. This state of affairs continued until July, when the Political Agent was able to assist a reconciliation between Shaiks Hamad and Abdulla. An arrangement was arrived at whereby the latter benefitted financially from his elder brother and received a promise of farther financial assistance in the event of Shaik Hamad succeeding to the Shaik. The results have, so far, ^ been satisfactory, in that Abdulla has ceased his opposition and family intrigues. An unexpected result is that he is no longer on good terms with his mother, who continues independently to influence the Ruler against Shaik Hamad. This lady has certain parts of the Islands under her absolute control and makes full use of her unlimited powers for oppression. She imprisons and punishes at will, frequently without semblance of trial. During the latter months of the year the Khalifeh family, with the excep tion of Shaiks Hamad and Abdulla, openly reverted to their policy of oppres sing the shiahs, who frequently applied to the Political Agent for redress, which it was not in his power to directly afford them. Shaik Hamad although ardently desirous of limiting these abuses cannot influence Shaik Easa, who in his extreme age is completely dominated by his wife. Apart from these insur mountable difficulties, the personal relations of the ruler with the Agency have greatly improved during the year, but owing to his senility he is unfor tunately incapable of discussing reasonably any important matter. ^ His deci sions are invariably those of his wife and no reason can prevail. Business had therefore to be conducted with Shaik Hamad, who however has no power to carry out any decision he may arrive at and can seldom persuade Shaik Easa. Allowing for his extremely difficult position, Shaik Hamad has behaved very creditably. T r ade. —During the early part of the year trade was abnormally depressed, but revived later as a result of the improvement in the pearl market. This was unexpected and obviated a great deal of anticipated distress among petty traders. Shipping. —The mail system which was dislocated in 1921 owing to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, has again become normal. One foreign ship only, flying the American flag, visited the port of Manameh during the year. H. M. Ships Triad and Cyclawien visited Bahrain on several occasions. Judicial—'Eighi hundred and fifty four civil suits and one hundred and twenty three criminal cases were disposed of during the year, and in addition two hundred and forty four petty cases were dealt with. The Court of His Majesty's Political Agent was closed during the months of July, August and September for recess. The Joint Court has functioned with increasing efficiency, largely owing to the fact that Shaik Hamad bin Easa, C.S.L,who sits jointly with the Political Agent, is genuinely disposed to judge impartially. The reverse was the case when Shaik Abdulla sat in the Court in 1921. Every c^se was then unwarrantably obstructed. There were a considerable number of diving disputes, but practically no resort was made to the f Salifeh ' Court. Consisting as it does of one person, notoriously corrupt and in the pay of the Nakhudas, divers prefer to drop their cases rather than take them before it. They are thus entirely without redress. The Chief Qadhi, Shaik Qasim binMehza, has satisfactorily disposed of the large number of c Shara ' cases referred to him. He is now very aged and there is no other Qadhi of any degree of reliability in Bahrain. The Ruler has as yet taken no steps to attract to Bahrain a possible successor to Shaik Qasim. Municipality.- —The Municipality of Manameh has made steady progress and much has been accomplished to improve the sanitation of the town and its surroundings, Several new roads have been made and many of the principalPEBSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 53 Bazaars have been widened and improved. The town is in urgent need of a water supply. At present all drinking water is brought in from a long distance at high cost. The Municipality are also desirous of inducing private enterprise to open an electric power station. The only obstacle to the execution of these two very necessary improvements is the conservatism of the aged Ruler, who declines to allow them to be introduced, although he has not been called upon for any financial or other assistance. Medical.—TYiv services of Assistant Surgeon J. Woodsell were acquired for the Victoria Memorial Hospital, which has greatly improved in efficiency and popularity since his arrival. The hospital building is in urgent need of repair for which, however funds have not been available. Small-pox has been prevalent most of the year in a mild form. An epidemic of Influenza occurred during the hot season. Climate. —The rainfall in the spring of 1922 was above the average and grazing was unusually good in the interior of Manameh Island. The autumn rains entirely failed. The hot season was milder than that of 1921. Tearl Fisheries. —The results from the average pearl fishing were those of a normal year. There was an unexpected revival of the pearl trade and the large stock of pearls which had accumulated owing to the depression of late years was entirely disposed of. Selling prices showed an advance of from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, on those of 1921. A single pearl found by a Bahrain boat sold for one lakh of rupees. In connection with the pearl trade a Monsieur Ruben, a French Jew accompanied by his Secretary Mademoiselle Marcelle, visited Bahrain and remained for several months. A representative of Messrs. Rosenthal also visited the Islands and purchased pearls to the value of about thirty lakhs. The Sultan of flajd. —The Political Agent visited Ojair in March on behalf of the Political Resident who was unable to go, and presented the insignia of the O.I.E. to Shaik Bin Jiluwi, Amir of Hassa, in the presence of a large gathering of notables. T1 e Political Agent accompanied His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq to Ojair on November 28th and met the Sultan of Najd. The terms of a treaty defining the boundary between Najd and Iraq were drawn up by His Excellency the High Commissioner and were accepted by His Highness the Sultan. Mr. Holmes represent fng London Einancial interests visited the Sultan at Hassa about the same time and obtained a concession for the exploita tion of oil and minerals throughout the province of Hasa, an area of about thirty thousand miles. Ruler of Shaik Abdulla bin Qasim A1 Thani visited Bahrain in October. In the course of a private interview Tvith the Political Agent he expressed apprehension of the increasing power of the Sultan of Najd, whose influence with disaffected persons within his dominions was causing him uneasiness. He was particularly anxious for a gift of guns from Government to increase his prestige which appears to have considerably decreased. 'Persian pretensions to Bahrain. —A campaign has been conducted in the Persian Press, with the object of urging the Persian Government to revive the claim to Sovereignity over Bahrain. Some of the articles appear to have been inspired by a few malcontents in Bahrain who designate themselves the 'Nationalist Party.' At the recent Postal Conference held at Busbire a Persian delegate, while not at the moment pressing for the Bahrain post office to be handed over, intimated that his attitude was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrain. Honours and Awards. —The insignia of the following decorations were awarded to the persons named during the year : — C. S. I. to Shaik Hamad bin Easa. M. B.

During the first half of February Ibn Sa'ud issued fresh orders to his subjects that nothing was to be imported into Kajd through Kuwait and several merchants who were then on tbeir way to Kuwait to purchase com modities turned back accordingly. Trade between Najd and Kuwait was not again resumed during the year. On the 11th March, Paisal ad-Dawish with a large force of Ikhwan attacked the 'Iraq tribes grazing round Abul Ghar. He then went onto Shaqra and attacked the camel police of Yusuf al-Mansur, inflicting consi derable loss on them. Aeroplanes were sent out to reconnoitre on the 13th and again on the 14th, and were heavily fired on by the Ikhwan who were encamped to the south of Shaqra. The aeroplanes retaliated, and the Ikhwan fled southwards under a heavy bombardment. Early in May Ibn Hallaf, of the Sa'id section of the Dhafir, perpetrated a series of raids m the neighbourhood of Safah and Qar'ah, killing a consider able number of Ikhwan. On the 5th July a party of thirty-five Dhafir and Aslam Shammar under a Dhafiri named Nu'man, attempted to raid a party of Kuwait subjects at Kuwaikib, eleven miles north-east of Jahrah, but without success. On the 24th September a party of Ikhwan, consisting of three hundred camels and fifty horsemen, under Ibn Ashwan, arrived at Subaihiyah and camped there, ostensibly to prevent raids from the north. On the following day a small party of Awazim, who were returning to their tribe from Kuwait, were held up by them and asked what they had been doing in Kuwait in contravention of Ibn Sa'ud's orders. They replied that they had not been in for the purpose of trade at all, but merely to collect some debts. They were told, however, that that was no excuse, as Ibn Sa'ud's orders were perfectly definite and Najd tribesmen were forbidden to enter the town for any purpose whatso ever. Their money and camels were confiscated, and the men returned to Kuwait on foot. The Ikhwan remained at Subaihiyah for some days and then withdrew. On the 27th September two Kuwait merchants, who were on their way to buy sheep from the Shammar, fell in with a raiding party of the Sa'id section of the Dhafir, under Muhammad bin Shiaihan, at Lamkh, between Wuqbah and Ansab in the Atwal adh-Dhafir, and were robbed of all their money and property. The Frontier between Kuwait and Najd. At a conference held at 'Uqair from the 27th November to the 3rd Decem ber between His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq and Ibn Sa'iid, at which the Political Agent was also present, the question of the frontier between Kuwait and Najd came up for discussion. An agreement was arrived at by which the frontier starts from the junction of the Wadi al-'Aujah with66 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE the Batin on the west. Prom this point, leaving Eiqa'i to Naja, it runs in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semi circle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish Agreement, dated the 29th July 1923, and thence follows the red semi-circle to the sea, south of Has al-Qulai'ah. The above forms the southern boundary of the recognised territory of Kuwait, but the tract of country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea, and on the south by a straight line running eastwards from the Shaqq in the west, through 'Ain al-'Abd, to the sea north of Has al-Mish'ab, is recognised as common to the two states of Najd and Kuwait, in which both shall enjoy equal rights, until such time as a fresh agreement be arrived at between them, with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government. The above Agreement, which was accepted and signed by Ibn Sa'up at the time, has been submitted to Shaikh Ahmad for approval. (The Shaikh approved the Agreement in January 1928). Najd Customs. In April the Shaikh of Kuwait received a letter from Ibn Sa'ud urging him to agree to a request which he had previously made that the Najd Cus toms dues on goods exported from Kuwait to Najd should be collected in Kuwait town, and promising to agree to the resumption of trade between Najd and Kuwait if he would do so. He said that he would either himself establish a Customs post in Kuwait, or let the Shaikh collect the dues for him, as he might prefer. The Shaikh after discussing the matter with the notables of Kuwait, refused Ibn Sa'ud's request. This question was also discussed at the 'TJqair Conference, and subse quently, on his visiting Kuwait, His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq talked the matter over with Shaikh Ahmad and succeeded in persuading him to adopt a more reasonable attitude. He informed Ibn Sa'ud that he had done so, and that the Shaikh was willing to meet him half way in the matter, and was prepared to receive a visit from a Customs expert on his part to frame a friendly arrangement in communication with his own experts to be conclud ed between the two parties. Kuwait Customs Administration. Khan Sahib 'Abdul Latif has continued to manage the Shaikh's Customs throughout the year, and the system has worked satisfactorily. Piracy. A case of piracy against a Kuwait hum on the Shattal-'Arab was reported in February. According to the ndkhuda's statement, as he was passing Mu'amir on his way up stream shortly after midnight on the 5th of the month a boat, with apparently only two men in it asked for a tow. A rope was thrown, and, when the boat came close up, eleven armed men, who had been concealed in it, rose and boarded the hum. They seized everything of value on board, and swore that they would murder the nakhuda and crew if they re ported the matter to the authorities. The men were so intimidated that they said nothing about having been robbed until they returned to- Kuwait four days later. The Shaikh then reported the matter to the Political Agent who referred it to the Divisional Adviser, Basrah. A gang, which had committed other robberies in the neighbourhood and was probably the one in question, was subsequently broken up. Arms Teaffic. The smuggling of arms and ammunition from Kuwait still continues to a limited extent, but the present Shaikh is undoubtedly trying his utmost to stop the traffic, and is meeting with considerable success. Arms are chiefly smuggled by sea to the smaller ports on the Persian coast between the Shatt- al-'Arab and Lingab, hidden in the general cargo of sailing boats they arePERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1023. 57 frequently taken out in small fishing boats, and trans-shipped into larger vessels at sea. They are also taken in lesser numbers to'Iraq by land ; this however, is more difficult, as the town is surrounded by a wall on the 'land side in which there are only three gates, and the Shaikh has prohibited the ex port of arms except by licence. An interesting method of concealing rifles on a boat was detected^ in March; two rifles had been lashed to the farman, or yard, with a lap of sail round them, and hauled to the top of ^ the mast. On this occasion, as in the case of a consignment of eight rifles and some ammu nition which were seized while being smuggled from the town in a small fishing boat in October, the Shaikh confiscated the boat as well as the arms, and imprisoned the crew. In August twelve rifles and over two thousand four hundred rounds of ammunition were discovered in a Kuwait boat at Bah rain and confiscated by the local authorities. On his return to Kuwait the nahhuda was at once arrested by the Shaikh, who awarded him a most drastic punishment for contravening his regulations. In the latter half of Septem ber a Dhafiri was arrested near Jahral with two rifles which he was bringing from Kuwait. The Shaikh imprisoned him, but subsequently released 'him and restored the rifles at the written request of Shaikh Hamud as-Suwait. He wrote to Shaikh Hamud that he was only doing so as a special case, and would not do so in future, as he had absolutely prohibited the export of arms except on licence. He added that he would only grant such a licence to his tribes men on a written request from him, and with the previous approval of Govern ment. The Shaikh informed the Political Agent of what he had done, and asked him to tell the Divisional Adviser, Basrah, and request him also to warn the Dhafir. On the 80th October the Shaikh captured and confiscated eight rifles which were being smuggled into 'Iraq by the land route. The gun runners had left Jahrah before he received information about them, but he at once ordered a pursuit. Unfortunately th^re were only two horsemen available at Jahrah at the time, and they did not like the idea of closing with the party when they sighted it, but contented themselves with opening rapid fire in the air to give the impression that there were more of them. Their ruse was successful, as the gun runners abandoned the rifles and made off. The rifles had been stripped and made up in a bundle. It afterwards transpired that these rifles were being taken to Khamisiyah. Murder. On the 22nd March a locally born British subject of Indian origin mur dered his wife by shooting her with a rifle. The man escaped to Basrah, but returned to Kuwait on the 24th April and was arrested by the Shaikh. On the matter being referred, it was decided that the case should be dealt with by the Shaikk in consultation with the Political Agent. The man was un questionably guilty and made no attempt to deny the charge. The Shaikh found the accused guilty of wilful murder, but, after some delay, merely sen tenced him to five years' imprisonment. The Shaikh's action was most sur prising, in view of the fact that he had all along appeared to consider that the man ought to be condemned to death if found guilty as a warning to others. Political Detenus. Shaikhs Mahmad and Gharib of Sulaimaniyah arrived from Bombay on the 27th January, on release'from prison in India, and remained in Kuwait as Political detenus till the 10th September when they were .repatriated. Pearl Fishery. The Kuwait pearling fleet was an extremely small one, only 226 boats visiting the banks. The season opened badly as regards the catch, but improv ed later, and was considerably better on the whole than that of the two pre vious years. The market for pearls was also better. Water Plant. Work continued on the Water Distillation Plant supplied by Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co., Limited, Muhammarah, throughout the year, but it has xi-30 o58 administration report of thu still failed to give satisfactory results. Early in January new copper tub^ plates were received from the United Kingdom to replace the original steel plates, and these were fitted by Mr. G. B. Pratt of Messrs. George Scott &amp; Son (London), Limited, the makers of the Plant. On the 16th March Mr. A. Campbell, Chemical Engineer of Messrs. George Scott &amp; Son (London), Limited, arrived to supervise the working of the plant. In April a six days' trial was attempted but the plant failed to make the capacity, and Mr. Campbell decided to close down. The chief trouble he found was the rapid formation of a very hard type of scale on the interior of the tubes, which he was unable to remove sufficiently quickly with the tube cleaner which he then had. He accordingly cabled to his firm asking for a more efficient kind of tube cleaner. On the 12th June Mr. G. B. Pratt died of heat stroke after a short ill ness, and Mr. Campbell continued the tube cleaning operations alone. Even after the arrival of two new tube cleaning instruments he experi enced great difficulty in removing the scale. This, however, was due to the fact that the scale in the tubes was of old formation ; and subsequent experience has proved that with the new instruments he can remove newly formed scale with comparative ease. The next trial was attempted in the beginning of November and in the first twelve hours the Plant made 225 tons water. During the night, however, the pans primed over and a considerable quantity of salt water got into the tank, making it quite undrinkable. The trial was accordingly abandoned. Another six days' trial was started in the latter half of December, but this too proved a failure, the Plant again making salt water. Agency Launch. . As it had been decided to remove the steam launch Lewis Pelly from Kuwait, she was sent to Basrah on the 9th May, to be towed to Bombay by R. I. M. S. Lawrence sold there. She has since been replaced by a large motor launch, which is not only much cheaper to mamtain a but is in all respects more useful for the work required. Honours. On the evening of the 1st January telegraphic intimation was received from the Hon'ble the Political E.esident in the Persian Gulf that His Majesty the King-Emperor of India, had approved of the grant of the honorary title of C.I.li to His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad-al-Jabir as-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait. His Majesty's Grants conferring on them the Dignity, together with the Badges of the Order, were delivered by the Political Agent to His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad-al-Jabir as-Subah, C.I.E. and Ahmad ath-Thunaiyan as-Sa'ud, who was then in Kuwait, in the Shaik's Audience Hall on the morning of the 3rd June, being the birthday of His Majesty the King-Emperor, Medical. 1^,040 out-patients, including 2,877 women and 2,516 children, were treated at the Agency Charitable Dispensary during the year, the daily average being 32^9 as compared with 21 , 24 in 1921. On the men's side of the American Mission Hospital 1,606 patients were treated; and on the women's side 2,287. Despite the fact that the daily average attendance figures for 192^ exceed those for 1921, yet the health of the town showed a distinct improve ment. In 1921 small-pox and measles accounted for a high infantile mortality, whereas in 1922 there was a marked decrease. The most prevalent diseases were digestive troubles, tuberculosis and granular opthalmia. C^lng to the prevalence of plague at Basrah and Muhammarah during JTay and June, quarantine restrictions were imposed on all arrivals fromPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1922. 59 those ports, other than first class passengers by steamer. The quarantine arrangements ran smoothly, the Shaikh exercising a strict control over them. Arrivals by steamer were quarantined in a special sailing boat provided for the purpose m front of the Customs House until released by the Quarantine Medical Officer, while arrivals by sailing boat were similarly quarantined m the boats in which they had arrived. This entailed a certain amount of discomfort to the passengers, hut in future the conditions will be more favourable, as His Majesty's Government having terminated the lease of the ground to the south of Bandar Shuwaikh on which they stand, the Shaikh has been given the use of the Wireless Buildings as a Quarantine Station for the town. American Mission. , Dr. N Leak arrived from England on the 27th January to take charge of the medical work of the American Mission until the return of Dr. Mylrea, and remained in Kuwait until the end of the year. Miss Strang arrived in Kuwait on the 25th March to join the Mission. Rev. G. Van Peursem arrived from Muscat on the 7th April, intending to spend the summer months in Kuwait, but had to leave for Basrah, en for Bombay, on the ith May, owing to the illness of Mrs. Van Peursem in India. Eev. E. E. Calverley and Mrs. Calverley (the lady doctor of the Mission) left for America on the 12th April. Eev. J. E. Moerdyk arrived on 14th October in relief of Rev. E. E. Cal verley. Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, O.B.E. and Mrs. Mylrea, arrived in Kuwait the 15th December, on return from a long visit to America and England. Miss Van Pelt was also in Kuwait throughout the year. Visits. {British). His Excellency Major-General Sir P. Z. Cox, G.C,M.G. 5 G.C.I.E. K.C.S.I., High Commissioner for 'Iraq, arrived in Kuwait in H. M. S. Cyclamen on the 8th December. The Shaikh visited him on board on his arrival. The High Commissioner returned the Shaikh's call on the morning of the 9th December, and left for Basrah the same afternoon. {Foreign), Shaikh Sir Khaz'al Khan Sarda^r Aqdas, G.O.I.E., with two of his sons, arrived from Muhammarah on the 9th Eebruary, and remained in Kuwait until the 18th March. M. Auguste Goguyer arrived from Bahrain on the 7th April to collect outstanding debts due to Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co., Muscat, and left for Bombay on the 27 th May. Ahmad ath-Thunaiyan as-Sa'ud, C.I.E., Ibn Sa'ud's representative at a conference which had been sitting at Muhammarah to delimit the frontier between 'Iraq and Najd, arrived from Muhammarah on the 26th May to await Ibn Sa'ud's reply to his report, and remained in Kuwait until the 12th June, when he left for Bahrain en route for 'Uqair. Father Joseph of the Erench Carmelite Mission, Baghdad, arrived from Muscat on the 26th August, and left for Basrah on the 10th September. Naval and Marine. The following ships of His Majesty's Navy and of the Royal Indian Marine visited Kuwait during the year :— K. I. M. S. Nearchus arrived on the 2nd January and left on the 3rd. H. M. S. Triad arrived on the 20th January, and left on the 24th. Jl. I. M. S, Nearohm arrived on the 14th March, and left the same day.00 administration report of the H. M. S.

Near dim arrived on the 22nd September, and left on the 23rd. H. M. S. Cyclamen arrived on the 8th December, and left on the 9th. Postal. There has been a weekly service of mail steamers from India throughout the year, and a fortnightly service from Easrah. To supplement the latter mails were also sent from Easrah to Tao as opportunity offered, and brought from there in water boats by a special postman. E xchange. The rate of exchange of Maria Theresa dollars varied from Rs. 170-2a. 3^. per cent, in March to Es. 189-3a. in December. British sovereigns fell from Es. 17-12a. in Jauuary to Es. 16-8a. in December. Turkish pounds fell from Es. 15-13«. in January to Es. 14rl2a. in December. C limate. The total rainfall during the year was only -96 inch. The summer was an exceptionally mild one. * J J. C.

J.CG1FDAnnual Report of the Persian Gulf Political Residency for the year 1923. Review by the Polilical Resident. * * During the year Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor held the office of Political Resident, but proceeded on six months , Personnel. leave on 7th April returning on. 17th Octo ber, during which Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Knox held charge of the Besidency. Mr. H. D. (x. Law, I.C.S., Captain Gr. L. Mallam and Major H. Pierpoint, •l.M.S., were respectively Secretary, Under Secretary, and Residency Surgeon throughout the year. For the purposes of this Review the sphere of the Persian Gulf Residency naturally divides itself into two divisions—Persian and Arabian. . • I.—P ersian. The principal feature on the Persian side was the consolidation of his power tw ™. * ^ w ht : • . r. by Reza Khan Sardar Sepah who remained Power of the War Minister Reza Khan. t \V* „ i? ttt i • ^ i . . Minister for War and virtual Director of Persia throughout the year. On the 'fall of Mushir-ed-Dowleh, he assumed the duties of Prime Minister as well as Minister for War. But this fact made no difference to his actual power ; throughout the year he was the absolute ruler of Persia, while towards the end of it he become de jpre as well as de facto head of the Government. His Imperial Majesty the* Shah (who had returned to Persia in December 1922) became more and more terrified of Sardar Sepah, and finding all intrigues, etc., against him of no avail left the country in November 1923, leaving his brother. Prince 'Wall Ahd, as Regent and Reza Khan undisputed master of the field. \ Towards the end of 1922 the War Minister began to convert the Government Military Government. country more and more into a Military Administration, and throughout the year under review the process has continued. Most of the Governors- Genera! and Governors are mere figure-heads, the General Officers and the Officers Commanding Troops being quite independent and doing all sorts of Governmental acts without instructions from, or even consulting the titular Governor. Actual Military Goverors were appointed during the year to Bebbehan, Kazerun, and several other places in Fars. As a sign of the times it may be noted that the Governor-General of Fars was requested to vacate a con- eiderable portion of the Arq which has been the Governor-General's official resi dence and office from time immemorial to make way for the troops ; similarly the. Governor-General of Arabistan (or Khuzistan as it is now re-named, this old name having bee» revived) has been turned neck and crop out of the Fort at Slrashtar where the Governors-General have always lived and which, it is believed, was buiU by a former Governor-General on the site—a very command ing one which dominates the whole to™—of a very old building. These things are indications which way the wind blows and it looks as if in a few years, if Raza Khan survives, there will be a regular (un-camouflaged) Military Government throughout the country. The other notable achievement of the Persian Government during the year Recovery of Arrears of Eevenue. ^ Settlement of the arrears of revenue due from various tribal heads and others in the south. Firstly during the Summer Colonel McCormack, one of the American Advisers with the able assistance of Mr. Peel, His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz, made a settlement with the Bakhtiari Khans who agreed to pay tumaus 500,000, partly in cash and partly in instalments over some years. LceiFD2 annual eepoet op the As a set-off tlie Bakhtiaris were allowed to claim arrears of revenue from Char Mahal, Aqili and, strange to say, Lirawi, which district for ten or twelve years the Bakhtiari had been attempting to get into their clutches but had been frus trated by the efforts of the Kesidency and Legation. The fact that the B ^khtiari had been allowed to claim fourteen years' arrears of revenue from Lirawi was only known to the Residency long after the evfent, when the Fourth Quarterly Eeport of the American Advisers came out and the settlement appeared in it. A protest has been made against this highly objectionable portion of the settlement. In November Colonel McCormack visited Arabistan and again, with the assistance of His Majesty's Consul for Arabistan, made a settlement of arrears of revenue with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, by which the latter has agreed to pay tumans 500,000 in cash and instalments over twenty years ; besides this the direct and indirect revenue for the future was fixed. Subsequently at the very end of the year, Colonel McCormack, after passing through Bushire and giving orders about Hayat Baud revenue went to Shiraz and effected settle ment of arrears of revenue with Qawam-ul-Mulk and Saulat-ed-Dowleh. At the end of the year troops were sent from Shiraz into Dashti and Dashtistan to collect the arreras of revenue from the Khans of their districts who had paid none for years. The column was still operating at the end of the year. In September the Qashkuli guards in the Mishun area mutinied and , ^ ^ threatend the staff—certain members Anglo-Persian Oil Company. being act , ually fired on . Having robbed a certain amount of the Company's property, the guards decamped. It is known that the Saulat-ed-Dowleh engineered this coup in order to break the Company's agreement with the Qashkulis ; whether he did so at the instigation or with the connivance of the Persian Government is not known. It is possible, however, as the Persian Government objected to the agreement between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Khans. Jt seems probable that the Company's agreement with the Saulat will also be rendered void by the affair—a result which he pro bably did not expect, but which is much to be desired. After five weeks a mili tary guard was sent from Shiraz and the Company's employees returned to their posts, and resumed work.. Considerable lo'ss wa:s of course caused to the Company by the outbreak. II.—A babian Section. The principal event on the Arabinn side of the Gulf Was the introduction of „ , . „ „ the long -talked-of reforms at Bahrain in rain Reforins - June by order of His Majesty's Govern ment. This was done by Colonel Knox who proceeded to Bahrain and, finding that the old Shaikh Isa was quite obdurate in refusing to introduce reforms, or to withdraw and allow his heir-apparent. Shaikh Hamad, to do so, was compelled to recommend to Government that Shaikh I^a should be put on one side willy- nilly, and this was done. The reforms were begun by the reorganization of the Customs Department for which Mr. G. N. Bower of the Imperial Indian Customs Department was deputed. Mr. Bower was speedily able to effect great economies and regularise the recovery of duties and payment of receipts to the Treasury : so successful in fact was he that by the end of the year, in spite of the fact that prices (and therefore ad valorem duties) had gone down, Mr. Bower was able to show that revenue showed an average increase of Rs. 1,150 per diem over the average of the preceding years. Other reforms in the shape of improved Courts of Justice ; establishment of a Levy Corps ; Revenue Survey and the improvement of the conditions of the Pearling Industry have been suggested and will, if and when approved, be gradually introduced. The present Ruler,^ Shaikh Hamad, is carrying on the administration well and listens to advice. It is a hard job for him as he is not a very strong man and very easy going, and to carry on the reforms he has to run counter to the whole weight of the opinion and wishes of the A1 Khalifa family. The next most important matter on the Arabian side was the transfer of the political charge of Nejd and Kuwait from 'Iraq to the Persian' Gulf Residency. This took place in accordance with the decision of the Cairo Conference, on ^the retirement of Sir Percy Cox from the High Commissionership of 'Iraq. Since June therefore the Resident became the medium of communication between His Majesty's Government and Bin Sa'ud, and has dealt with the external political affairs of Kuwait and Bahrain under the orders of the Colonial Office.PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL EESIDBNCY, 1923. 3 In 1921 tli(3 Anglo -Persian Oil Company had asked for permission to Oil Concessions. negotiate with Bin Sa'ud and the Arab ^ in n . . , principalities on the shore of the Persian rnv co ? cessi ? n ^ search for and exploit oil, if found, in their territories. his ma er hnng fire for a long time but during the year permission was given for negotiations to^commence. In the autumn of 1922, however, a certain Major Holmes ac mg on behalf of the Eastern Syndicate appeared on the scene and nhfn 0 - H ining P e rmission of His Majesty's Government, went to Eiyadh and obtained a general concession for minerals and oil from Bin Sa'ud. The result of this was that by the time the Anglo-Persian Oil Company started to negotiate with the Shaikh of Kuwait and Bahrain, those potentates, taking their cue from Bin ba ud, declined to have anything to do with the Company. So far, although these Shaikhs have not been able to show any valid reason for objecting to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's draft concession they will not look at it, and are most anxious to do a deal with the Eastern Syndicate. It appears that Bin Sa ud and the Shaikhs following his lead are afraid of the Anglo-I ersian Oil Company as being a Government concern which is likely to encroach on their sovereign rights. As regards Muscat : the Sultan gave an undertaking to the Resident not to give a concession to anybody not approved by the British Government but owing to his absence at Dhofar from March till the end of the year it was not possible to open any negotiations with him. There are signs however that the Sultan will not follow the lead of Bm. Sa'ud and the two Shaikhs but will be ready to give a concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The only other matters of interest at Muscat are the finances and the Levy Muscat. ' Corps. The former are unfortunately in proposals had to be made for retrenchment 7 ^ year The Levy Corps on the other hand done very well under Captain McCarthy 11 0 \ eT 111 a ve ^ efficient co ^ion to hS successor when he left for India to pass his examination in March.

It is hoped that it will be possible to carry out the multi fanous duties of the Corps with 200 men, but it will be hard work.

On the Arabian side, beyond the Bahrain reforms the year has not produced much : at all events it has been a quiet year with no disturbances or lighting near the Coast.

It is fair to say that in the matter of the visit to Bushire of Haider Khan (which will be dealt with later) 'Nasr-ed-Dowleh showed plenty of determination, proved himself a man of his word, and was sensible and friendly. K arguzabat. Yamin-ul-Mamlik combined the duties of Governor and Karguzar till April when Sadiq-ul-Mulk, a rather conceited and inexperienced young man from Tehran, was appointed as acting Karguzar. He remained in Bushire in that capacity till 29th July when he left and was succeeded by Muazz-es-Sultan, who had once before been Karguzar here. The latter remained as Karguzar till the end of the year. Formerly believed to be strongly anti-British, Muazz-es-Sultan has been careful this time, with a friendly Governor on the spot, to be ostensibly more impartial. He is a man of independence and strong character with whom our official relaions have been on the whole satisfactory, throug, in correspond ence, he is given to intemperate and even uncivil language ; and is far too ready to make a case out of the most trivial issue. F inance D epartment. The year was marked by great activity on the part of the Finance Department represented in Bushire by Hakim-ul-Mamalik, the local Controller. With the help of the Military he succeeded in recovering arrears of revenue from the Khan of Angali, from Salar-i-Ashjaa (Agent of Nizam-es-Saltanah, leaseholder of Dashti), and from some of the Shaikhs of the ports along the Coast. Early, in the year the official in-charge of the ' Indirect Taxes ' was instructed to collect these on behalf of the Finance Department ; and later on the local Control ler of Finance was ordered to take over formal charge of the department of Indirect Taxation. These taxes levied on caravans leaving Bushire was former ly one of the principal sources of income to the Municipality who used the pro ceeds for various purposes to the benefit of the local public : and this move on the part of the Central Finance Department caused consternation among all classes in Bushire who feared that the income would be remitted to Tehran and would no longer be available for local use. Meetings of protest were convened by the Governor and attended by the public, but in spite of this opposiion the order remained inforce. The Municipality however has not suffered as all receipts are duly credited to that body by the Finance Department. The Finance Department also attempted to get hold of the money collected by the Customs Department by means of a small impost on every package clear ed and handec^over to the Education Department in Buhsire for the upkeep of the three local schools. This attempt to appropriate funds voluntarily collected for years past for the good of institutions in which the public are all keenly in terested aroused the greatest indignation ; and the bazaar was closed by way of protest. On this occasion the Finance Department gave : way, and the old arrangements continued in force. SECTION 5. Military.- —The steady ascendancy of the military in every sphere of Govern- in ent was a marked! feature of the year in Bushire as doubtless it was in most other parts of Persia. The War Minister's -policy of securing a strong centraliz ed Government in Persia by means of a MiHtarySfiegemonv which could oulv be acquired at the expense of the authority both of tribal leaders and the Civil re- nresenatives of the Government was first introduced into Bushire bv Reza Khan himself when he visited the South of Persia in December 1922. The outward and visible signs of the new order of things, which may be said to date from the beginning of 1923, were :— (1) The overriding of civil authority. —Thus it was plain to overbody that the son of Haidar Khan who had been arrested by th^ War Minister's orders in Bushire was detained in custody by Eeza Khan's mil alone. The Governor of Bushire was powerless in the matter and all orders on the subiect wer^ com municated direct to tbe local military by the army authorities. Thus also, the local police force remained under the orders of the head of he Militarv detach ment in Bushire throughout the year notwithstanding the protests of both Gover nors that without some show of force at their disposal their authority could never be asserted. The same tendency was shown w other wavs as for instance in the transfer 'to military control of the Persian Customs boats ' Persepolis ' and 11 Muzalfer ' early in the year.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1923. 7 (2) Strengthening of Military forces in the South. —As a preliminary to tli© extension of military power over the tribes in the South, also incidentally as an argument in favour of the reduction of the British Military Garrison in Bushire, the Persian Military Forces were increased early in the year by the arrival of about 100 regulars from Shiraz. Subsequently the Amnieh tufangchis on the Bushire-Shiraz road were dismissed and the protection of the road was handed over to the military authorities who placed several small detachments on the road. The local forces were strengthened from time to time and detachments were sent out to outlying ports and places in the Hinterland ; so that by August 1st, 1923, and December 31st, 1923, their disposition was roughly estimated to be as fol lows :— August 1st 1923 December 31st 1923. Busliire .. .. .. 100 men .. 100 men. Borasjun .. .. .. 100 „ .. 100 „ Behbehan .. ..

Sarhang Saifullah Khan from the Shiraz brigade visited Bushire for a month in the spring : and Mohammed Taqi Khan, Officer Commanding the Shiraz Brigade, carried out an inspection of the local forces in the early autumn. The discipline and morale of these troops seem to be good. They are at any rate well informed, fairly punctually paid and are not only taking themselves seriously but are taken seriously by everybody. It can be readily imagined that this sudden appearance in the South of a national army in being, on however mod est a scale, works a profound change in the whole situation of affairs in this part of Persia ; and there can be no doubt that the little army here commands the situation. One may doubt the wisdom of the policy of sending out small detach ments such as the party at Dilwar whose object is to check smuggling into the interior (particularly of arms and ammunition), but at all events it is a sign that the Persian military department is alert to control affairs and to make its presence felt everywhere. There can be no doubt as to the success of the army in keeping order on the main road to Shiraz. A state of good order and of confidence reigns all along the road to the immense benefit of trade and to a degree which has not been known in modern times. Nor is it possible to question the generally tranquilizing effect which the presence of these troops has already had in the Hinterland. When Zair Khidar Khan, the notorious chief of Thangistan, was murdered along with his younger son in April, civil war and disturbance on a considerable scale might easily have come about. A detachment of over 100 men were at once sent out from Bushire to keep order in the district and arrest, if possible, the murderers, and they were able to return in a month after having prevented any outbreak of real disorder in the tribe. Towards the end of the year a considerable force of about 600 infantry with 4 machine guns, 100 cavalry and 30 artillery with 2 mountain guns arrived in Bushire from Shiraz, with the object of collecting revenue from Dashti and Dashtistan, and generally asserting a moral ascendency over the tribes possibly also of disarming them. The heavy rains of December prevented them from doing anything very decided before the close of the year. The success of this expedition therefore remains to.be seen. The influence which the Military have thus been able to exert on the local situa tion has of course, profoundly weakened the power of the local Khans. They now stand or fall as they are supported or not by the army. Thus Ghazanfar- es-'Saltaneh the Zabit of Borasjun, lately a power in the land, was in the autumn pressed by the Military to increase his revenue from 6,000 to 10,000 tomans (to^ swell the Military budget). His protests resulted in his immediate replacement by his nephew Atha Khan (formely known as pro-British) who with the help of Shaikh Mohammed oi* Chakutah (equally known as anti-British) found the requir ed amount. The same method if applied to other Khans—and its success in this case promises that it may be—-must result in the ruin or disappearance of the Khans. Whether this break up of the tribal system will be a good thing or a bad thing for Persia is beside the point. It is in process of being accomplished and is the deliberate object of the Army Command. This shufflmg of the cards has the further effect, seen in the Borasjun case where our late friends and enemies are brought into the same camp, of eliminating what little there remains of British influence upon tribal affairs in the Bushire Hinterland.8 ANNUAL EEPOET OF THE The Military were given another opportunity of encroaching on tribal ground by the unfortunate debacle at the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's work at Mishum account of which will be given later). The departure of the tribal guards and the forced closing down of the Company's drilling operations till arrange ments could be made for their security gave the Persian Government a chance they were eager to take of ousting the tribesmen who had been formerly respon sible to the Company, and handing over the duty of safeguarding the work to military detachment of some ten men, and Non-Commissioned Officer and an officer. So far the arrangement has worked satirfactorily. SECTION 6. T he P olitical S ituation. The temporary increase of anti-British feeling which had followed the War Minister's visit to Bushire in December and which had been occasioned by his proclamation regarding the presence 'of British troops and his imprisonment of Allah Karam Khan, did not long survive the unconditional release of the latter towards the end of January. Attempts were made to fan the flame by posting up placards purporting to have been written by Allah Karam intimat ing that the British had intended to occupy Bushire if Allah Karam had been harmed in any way ; but the placards were removed by the Military and publicly disowned by Allah Karam himself, and the excitement over the whole incident soon fizzled out. So when the body of the ' martyred ' Shaikh Hussain of Chakutah who had been killed in a fight with the South Persia Rifles was brought into Sabzabad for internment in a Man solemn specially built for its re ception, the attempts of Shaikh Mohammed, his son, to turn the ceremony into an anti-British demonstration were entirely fruitless. Nor did Zair Khidhar of Tangistan's death cause any recrudescence of animosity in Bushire, though the Shiraz press was particularly venomous on that occasion. Indeed the studied aloofnes of the British in Bushire frOm local politics gave no opportunity for opposition though possibly it aroused curiosity. Certainly this was the' pre vailing feeling when Haider Khan, C LE., of Hayat Baud came to Bushire in mid-summer ostensibly to make his peace with the local representatives of the Persian Government. The persistent attempts made -by the Persian Govern ment last year (and narrated in last year's report) to coerce Haider into agree ing to a re-assessment of his revenue and to giving formal guarantees of loyalty and submission to their authority were not abandoned. As no issue seemed likely to be reached by the protracted negotiations between Haider Khan and the local Finance authority, the Political Resident felt it necessary to report the whole matter to the Minister at Tehran and ask that a definite settlement be definitely reached by the Central Government one way or another as soon as possible. Meanwhile ftie Prime Minister and War Minister had given our Minister a definite assurance that no action would be taken against Haider Khan without our being informed beforehand. In spite of these orders the Finance Controller one day, apparently on his own responsibility, sent an Inspector over to Kharag with four 1 Cossacks ' as a personal escort, with the object of assess ing the revenue coming in from the pearl fishery of Kharag which was then going on. Haider Khan who had been prepared for such a contingency had collected an armed force on Kharag and prevented the landing of the party who returned discomfited to Bushire. This unfortunate incident, occasioned though it was by the rash action of the Finance Controller, could not be overlooked. It was perhaps inevitable that the War Minister should regard it as a deliberate insult to his army. In dny case he immediately ordered that if Haider Khan did not at once give the guarantees demanded of him a military expedition should be sent to subdue him. The consequences of such action would have been deplorable for every reason, and when the Governor His Excellency Nasr-ed-Dowleh (who had just arrived) proposed that Haider Khan should come to Bushire and pay his respects to him, thus giving clear proof of his loyalty, the idea was supported by the Political Resident who urged Haider Khan in his own interests to come in and endeavour to establish relations with the local Government. After receiving guarantees of personal safety from the Governor, Haider Khan eventually came in, spent a week in Bushire where he was hospitably entertained and treated with much courtesy by the Governor, and departed after giving a ' guarantee of loyalty ', apparently satisfied with the results of his visit, politically, although it was not found possible to effect a settlement of the claims of the Finance Depart ment ; and the vexed question of whether Haider Khan or the Persian Govern ment is entitled to the pearl revenues was not even touched upon. In the inter views he ha d with the Political Resident the latter made it quite clear to HaiderPEHSUK GULF POLITICAL HESIDE^CY, 1923. 9 Khan that in the altered circumstances which had arisen since the War, it was not to the interest of the British Governmerit to continue such close relationships as formerly with tribal leaders to the exclusion of the local Persian authorities ; and he was strongly urged to adapt himself to the new situation and arrive at a ' modus vivendi ' with the Governor of Bushire. One result which followed this rapprochment was the inclusion of Hayat Baud Bandar Rig and Lirawi among the districts called upon to nominate candi dates for election to the new Majlis. Voting papers were distributed, and at one time it ^ was supposed that of the total of 13,000 votes permitted for Bushire with its two representatives, Haider Khan would command enough to be able to secure the election of his own nominee. In the end after a great deal of intrigue and wire-pulling Mirza Ali Kazeruni, resident in Tehran, and Ahmed Akhgar of Shiraz were elected to represent Bushire - and its Hinterland. The former was one of the two deputies in the previous Majlis, and is notorious as an anti-British politician of the worst type, who had to leave Bushire some years ago as a result of pressure b^ the British on account of his fradulent bankruptcy and forgery among other things. Akhgar has not even that claim to represent Bushire with which place he has no connection whatsoever. He is also believed to bo strongly anti-British. The election of this man is due to the anomalous fact that a large area in the electoral district of Bushire Dashti ( and Dashtistan) is at the same time under the administrative control and influence of the Governor General of Fars. The voting for a deputy to represent Bushire is therefore controlled not from Bushire but from Shiraz. The Residency has for years recommended the inclusion of Bashti and Dashtistan in the Bushire Province, so far without result except in 1912-14 when it was so included ; the position however now is that the Prime Minister has promised to consider matter when the present Governor-General of Fars leaves. The announcement of the results, of the election was followed by an intensive campaign of bribery and wire-pulling the object of which was to upset the election of Akhgar which the partisans of Nizam-es-Saltanah's son—who was next on the list of candidates- claimed to have been illegal. An official was appointed to hold an enquiry into the circumstances and much money was poured out especially by Nizam-es- Saltanah's faction, but to no purpose ; for the upshot was that Akhgar's elec tion was confirmed. Consistently with the instructions received from His Majesty's Legation, the officers of this Residency remained entirely aloof from all connection with these elections, and from the canvassing and contrjoversy, which went on before and after the ballot was taken. The deportation of the Muptahids from Iraq in mid-summer caused little or no excitement in Bushire. In response to orders from Tehran the bazaars were closed for one day ; but this enforced stoppage of business aroused no sympathy among the trades people. At the end of September Haji Shaikh Mehdi al Khalisi, the Chief of these deportees, arrived in Bushire from Aden, en route for Tehran. He was given an official reception on a very modest scale ; but his visit aroused almost no interest among the public of Bushire and absolutely no anti-British demonstrations as had been expected. The Mujtahid himself handicapped as he was by an almost total ignorance of the Persian language, kept very quiet, and did nothing to foment any ill-feeling. SECTION 7. ♦ R ussian A ctivities. Whatever his secret propaganda may have been (and we have very little indication of any such except the fact that he has an extensive correspondence with Indian nationalists) outwardly the Russian Consul-GeneraPs activities in Bushire do not seem to have been particularly successful. Monsieur Lindin's attenipts to form a communist party and to start a democratic Persian news paper in Bushire both failed—probably owing to lack of funds—and he has not been able to form anything like a pro-Russian party among the business men or officials of the place. Monsieur Lidin is a quiet young man, and has been on the whole discreet He exchanged visits after his arrival with Colonel Knox ; but he had no further rela/tions with the British Consulate throughout the year. He did not call on the French Consul. ~ Lc61FD10 annual eepokt of the SECTIONS. T eade and T eade F acilities. Trade. —During the year, the tendency shewn in last year's Trade Eeport for the reduction of the adverse trade balance, has continued. The value of imports is being reduced and that of the exports increasing. This increase is due mainly to the export of opium. In the year 1922, the total number of cases of opium exported from Bushire was 1,567 at an average price of Tomans 1,200 each. In 1923 the number of cases increased to 4,090 and the price to Tomans 1,400. This resulted in an increase in the value of this export of Ts. 3,845,600 or £76,912 at an average rate of Krans 50=£1. On the whole, trade has been very dull, money being tight, but this quiet period is generally regarded as a healthy sign, as it enables the country to re cover from the inflated conditions which immediately followed the War. No foreign ship visited the port during the year. T eade C ommunications. Roads. —Since the trade of Bushire is mainly due to the use of the town as an entrepot for commerce destined for the interior, the safety of the main artery for the distribution of this trade—namely the Bushire-Shiraz road—is a large factor in determining its volume. ^ Since the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles the road had been guarded by irregular (and irregularly paid) riflemen whose extortions were only slight ly more endurable than those of robbers. Since March 1923, however, the road has been guarded by Cossacks of the regular Persian Army and under this regime, the complaints of travellers on this road have been very greatly reduced. Muleteers and others are very satisfied with this arrangement. There is another-aspect of the military control which was, however, pro ductive of bad results. This is the presence in Dashti and Dashtistan of a Persian force sent there to collect arrears of revenue. The officers and men of this force were in the habit of commandeering mules and muleteers both for Government use and for their own. This became so common that muleteers sometimes refusal to take loads along the road and when they could be persuaded lo do so, demanded extra hire. This naturally increased the price of goods in the interior and reduced demand. The exaction of illegal taxes from travellers on the road continues despite the efforts of the Minister of War in November 1922. ' Navaghel ' or municipal lax continues to be levied at two points on the road on all vehicles and animals. The other taxes ' rahdari ' ' alifi etc., are still collected. The condition of the actual road steadily deteriorated. There was a certain amount of motor traffic up and down, but if it is intended to open up the road on a service scale for motor (passenger) traffic (and a Parsi Syndicate has ambitions in this direction) very considerable repairs and alterations will have to be undertaken. As the Persian Government intends to use the road for large cars and the transport of heavy and bulky military material, it is probable that something will be done. The very heavy winter rains have already done a lot of damage to the surface and it is clear to everybody who has seen the road that to put it into proper order, and to keep it in reasonable repair, will be a very costly business, especially so long as the existing alignment, which was never meant for motor traffic, is adhered to. But the cost of the diversion which was aligned by the engineers of the British force in 1919 and which in volves building a new road over hilly country for about 60 miles, will probably be heavier than the Persian Government can face at present. P ostal F acilities. As had been arranged at the Postal Conference held at Bushire in December 1922, the Indian Post Office handed over charge to the Persian Postal Authori ties on 14th April. It was hardly to be expected that after little more than 6 months the Persian Postal service should be able to invite serious comparison with that of the Indian Postal Department with its 60 years * experience in the Grtilf. And in many ways the new service is indifferent. There has been at times an insufficiencv of stamps, and there is regularly a ereat delay in the delivery of the 'nareels. The rupee money order and-V. P. P. system has almost ceased to exist. The defects are not due to lack of willingness on the part of the localpersian gxjle political residency, 1923. 1 1 Persian Postal Officials, and a tribute is due especially to Monsieur Chauviaux, Inspector General of Posts in the South, for his energy and invariable courtesy. But he has been hampered by lack of experience among his staff, and lack of funds to pay them punctually. Inelastic financing arrangements due to the system of Treasury administration introduced by the American Advisers also give rise at the close of the year to a serious congestion of parcels for up- country in the Bushire Post Office. Some 7 tons of parcels were lying wait ing to be taken on whicH the contractor refused to handle as he was already owed 1,500 Tomans by the Persian Government. The local authorities had no power to pay up or even make advances against this debt, and the Central Administration refused to accord sanction. The state of affairs would have been even worse than it was if the Inspector did not make advances out of his own pocket. With a staff insufficient owing to consistent ill-health, which has also not been, paid for months, the Postal Department in Bushire at the end of the year was m a thoroughly bad way. oltrrekcy. The restrictions imposed by the Persian Government on the export of specie continued to have the baleful effect which was noted in last year's report. Smuggling which it had been the very object of the embargo to prevent, was indulged in freely. Nevertheless trade between Bushire and Behbehan and other places along the littoral, where there are no banking facilities of any sort, was almost strangled. The obstinate refusal of the Persian Government to allow the transport of Krans from Bushire to Ganaweh for the payment of wages to the numerous employes of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company working there and in the Bikarz area, resulted in a serious state, of affairs in the Sprin-- Che men had no wages and the contractors had no means of importing food and stores without credit in Bushire which thev were unable to provide without sending m money. A state of famine- very nearly ensued. Eventually the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was compelled to run the risk of transporting nilhon by land The consignment got through' without mishap. It was not till July that, after the repeated representations of His Majesty's Minister at e l 1T S n ' ^ P ro ^ es ^ s ^ entire trading community at Bushire, British and Persian the embargo both on the transport of Krans under cabotage and on vhe export of rupees, was removed by the Persian Government. B ritish F irms. In the course of the year Messrs. Dixon &amp; Co. of Manchester went into voluntary liquidation. No liquidator was appointed in Bushire but the Aiesopotamia-Persia Corporation undertook to take charge of, and'sell such tlie goods belonging to the firm as were lying in Bushire at the time. ' SECTION 9. B ushire H interland. Mention has already been made of Haidar Khan's relations with the Government ; of Ghazanfar-es-Saltanah's enforced relinquishment ot the Khanate of Boras,]un ; and of the disturbed state of affairs in Taneistau consequent upon the murder of Zair Khidhar. There is little else of importance io record regarding the Bushire hinterland, as the nps and downs, and inter- tribal feuas and jealousies that formerly used to comprise the historv of this part of Ears have now been more or less obliterated by the pressure of thp new military organization in the South, which has in effect reduced all the Khans to a dead level of insignificance relatively to the power of the Persian Gov ernmejit as represented by the Army. If any Khan keeps his- head above thp general level it is Shaikh Mohammed of Chakutah who, born intriguer that he is, has succeeded in keeping in with the Military and using such precarious influ ence as he enjoys m this way to assert sopae predominance over the other Khans U was due m large measure to this man's influence, that Akhgar was elected as a Deputy for Bu shir em despite of the wishes of the whole of the communitv steady hostility to Haid^Khfrn^ ^ ^ ^ lnaintaills his a 'itude of .STrwe Trade.—Twenty-sevent slaves who had taken refuge respective'v dLlg the year. g ' ^ AbbaS 12 ^ BuSllir0 ^ Were ^mitttd14 annual eeport of the APPENDIX.

Hospital. —The new hospital was occupied in April 1923. Its design is a compromise between what is needed for a hospital on the one hand and local Per sian ideas of architecture coupled with insufficiency of funds on the other. As a result, when occupied, it lacked electric light, a water-supply, cookhouses, quarters for staff, ( and a sanitary and drainage system. Electric light lias been installed, two engines purchased and, thanks to the Anglo-Persian Oil Com- pany, a free supply of kerosine oil and petrol for power. A proper drain has been nnide into the sea, latrines constructed and a water-tank on the roof for finishing purposes supplied by an automatic electric pump from a well, is in course of erection. A large ' Ab-ambar ' has been Constructed to be connected by a semi-rotary hand pump to another tank on the roof for the supply of water to the operation theatre and dispensary. The hospital has carried on its work under difficulties while these additions have been made, and it cannot yet be considered be other than an Out-door ' Dispensary. The question of staff has to be settled if the hospital is to take ' In-patients The old staff, ample for out-door dispensary is paid by the Indian Government. It is quite insufficient for the needs of an In-patients , hospital, and this question, together with that of the provision of quarters for staff and the erection of cook-houses will be brought before the hospital com mittee as soon as the electric-light, water-supply and drainage systems are finished. During the year the total number of cases treated were :-r- Out-door 10,776, with 516 minor operations. In-door 164, with 148- operations. Quarantine. —In Charbar plague broke out in February and terminated in July 1923.

More especially for one who has experienced the turmoil of formerTears it is gratifying to testify that the ; detente ' of the early part of 1923 has been coirv ented into- a tranquilhty' the like of which has not been seen since the end ol IS asr-ud-Dm Shah s reign There is no doubt that the peasantry and populace as a whole are grateful for the security now enjoyed, and travellers and caravans along the mam road from the eea to the capital are spared the apprehensions and risks with which any journey was undertaken. All credit is therefore due to the Persian military force in Ears, and to the new ' Amnieh ', or road-guard semce for the part they have pkyed in making their presence felt in several parts ot the province and m intimidating bands of highway robbers. Certainlv tae knowledge that the reins of government in the capital are in stronger hands than for many years past, and that behind the comparatively small force in this large province there exist considerable bodies of troops in Isfahan and Tehran available tor service, with detachments working at the re-establishment of the authority of government m all other provinces, has materially aided the task of both military and civil authorities in Ears, and had its salutary effect on tur bulent tribesmen and bandits. Perhaps the most appreciable and evident bene- iit must be attributed to the 1 Amnieh ' road-guard service, which under an energetic and conscientious chief—Yawar Malikzadeh—has suppressed the out standing evil on the Bushire-Shiraz road 4 rahdari ' .or blackmail under arms by the local riflemen supposed to protect caravans and by local chieftains, who drew tiiei errom a large income to which they have tenaciously clung. This 4 rahdari ' had practically ceased by the end of 1923, and all that remains to be eradicated are tribute m kmd from muleteers and camelmen in the shape of small quanti ties ot tea alid sugar, and a tendency to create monopolies of the sale of fodder at the various stages for the benefit of local headmen or indeed the ' Amnieh ' department itself.

The admission of responsibility by the ' Amnieh ' service for recovery of goods robbed or payment of compensation is of value to Trade, and the actual payment of compensation will, it is hoped, influence Assurance Companies in Great Britain at least to reduce the rates of insurance i land Persia.

The next feature to be recorded is the effort of the Einance Ministrv wHIi tile States Advisers in the capital, to obtain a greater hold , n the revenue, and to increase it. A more business-like spirit and inculcatloii16 ANNUAL REPOET OF THE of honesty and zeal has been evident to all, first under Haji Izz -ul-Mamalik thea under Haji Fain-ul-Mulkj yet no one better than the senior departmental officers realize the uphill task, which they have before them in this province, and, on their frank admission, the progress made is far from satisfactory. Not only are portions of the province in derelict condition, unable to produce crops or revenue, but the economic situation has been unfavourable to landowners and tax-payers, so that in many cases the latter have thrown it on the administration to take the government tithe from produce in kind in distant districts. Vested interests like those of the clerical leaders and their supporters use their influence to escape* taxation : and, when in the winter of 1923 the administration decided in the interest of sanitation in Shiraz and to minimize fraud on the excise branch through the distilling of raw spirits in private houses of the Jewish quarter, to limit all distilling to one building outside the town, the clerical leaders supported by the press demanded the suppression of this distillery in the name of the Islamic prohibition on the drinking of fermented liquors. (This, though not a few of the leading Mullahs and nearly all grades of the population of Shiraz are notoriously wine and Araq-bibbers in secret). The insistence by the United States Advisers on the payment of all receipts into the Imperial Bank of Persia by the various provincial departments has been a sound reform. So also has been the fixing of budget limits on the telegrams sent by departments (except the Military). The flying inspection by Cplonel MacCormack and his Persian colleagues from Tehran in November was all to the good. The administration is now building large warehouses in the Artillery Square so that all crude opium brought in from the districts may be refined under its direct control instead of on the premises of traders as heretofore, and also to increase the tobacco excise. Various small sources of excise have been consolidated and the ' Nawaqil ' dues on all .pack animals transporting mer chandise from Bushire to Isfahan have been applied with greater strictness to all animals owned by inhabitants of the urban area of Shiraz. Under the direct pressure of the Ministry of Finance in Tehran the Qashqai chieftain, Soulat- ud-Douleh, has been compelled to pay an instalment of 40,000 Tumans (£8,000) towards the Tumans 130,000 (£26,000) at which the Finance Ministry has compromised some 300,000 Tumans claimed as arrears of revenue of the Qashqai tribes. Similarly, during Colonel MacCormack's visit, the other great magnate of Fans, Qawam-ul-Mulk, effected a settlement of the dispute he had with the government over taxes, payable for the past two years on a sliding scale, with a reduction for the expenses of collection : the military expedition to Dashti in January 1924 enabled 1 the revenue agents to collect from that district 23,000 Tumans (£4,600), the equivalent of two years' land tax being accepted to cover- much larger arrears : and the taxation of the villages of Burazjun district has been removed from the control and farm of the hereditary Zabit, assumed by the revenue agents direct and raised to 11,000 Tumans (£2,200). But, even with these efforts, the land revenue collected in the first eleven months of the year March 22nd 1923-24 has been far below the scheduled standard of 798,000 Tumans (£159,600).

A study of the economic situation and needs of Fars is being separately Bubmittedr and m this despatch only brief comm-ent is made as regards the year 19^3-_;4. The situation of trade in Shiraz and other towns has been increasingly unhealthy during the past months. Speculation in the boom, which so soon cracked in 1919-20, not only .reduced the small capital of most Persian traders in r ars to the lowest dimensions, and in some cases rendered them practically insolvent, but the fall in prices landed them in heavy loss on the stocks they still hold. Sales still proceed at a loss on a generally falling market, and to keep themselves afloat they give further orders, only to sell again at a loss. Eeady money has been uncommon in dealings, and paper commitments unreliable, and paid at long date. ^ For the first nine months of 1923 heavy dealings in opium, at extremely high prices, while relieving the pressure on landowners and benefit- ing peasant cultivators, ultimately plunged the leading dealers into serious em barrassment, because the Far Eastern market refused to pay the high price of 1922-23 and left the Shirazi merchants with large quantities of chests, still unsold. Following this there has been a reckless sowing of opium in the late autumn of 1923, to an unprecedented extent, owing to the hope of cultivators and landowners throughout the province to obtain once more the high local prices of 1922-23. If the crop is as large as expected the holders of chests of the 3923 crop must be faced with losses which will further shake credit in Shiraz. Incidentally the opium operations of 1923, in the drawings in rupees for financ ing purchase, have adversely affected the sterling exchange. With the bazaar so lifeless for months together, and business in cottons and sugar so unprosper- ous, there is considerable pessimism among traders as to the future : indeed some observers apprehend that if restriction of the trade is enforced in the Far East by the League of Nations a crash will follow in the bazaars of Shiraz anfl other places in Persia. Local politicians are preaching the encouragement of exports and economic development by the Government. Some trials are being made by a handful of landowners of American and Iraq cotton seed. The rain fall of the winter of 1923-24 was exceptionally heavy, and favourable to agri culture. G overnors -G eneral, and various events in S hiraz. When the period under survey opened at the end of May 1923 Prince Sarim- ud-Douleh was Governor-General, having held the post since December 1922, and the counting of votes for the elections to the fifth Majlis was almost com plete. There can be little doubt that from beginning to end votes were not only bought and sold from peasantry brought in for the purpose, but that manv of those in the ballot-box (for the election went on for a month or two) were changed for others according to the panel chosen for election first by the Governor-General and later by the military administration. The number of candidates ran, into several hundreds. The outlying districts voted chiefly according to the ' returning officers for the peasantry took no interest in the proceedings. Unfortunately for the Governor-General he quarrelled in June with the military commander over a change in the panel of official nominees desired by the latter : and certain disappointed elements in Shiraz took the extreme step on July 1st of pouring petrol into the ballot-box, putting to flight the 1 returning officers ' by a discharge of firearms, and then going into sanctuary ( u bast ') at the Persian Telegraph Office with their supporters, as a demons tration against the Governor-General. Sarim-ud-Douleh accused the Military LcGlPD% 16 ANNUAL REPORT OP THE Command of having connived at tliese disorderly proceedings, and Brigadier- General Fazlullali Klian Zahidi, with an ambition to succeed to a military governorship in Fars, added fuel to the fire by demanding the use of the Gover nor-General's quarters in the Government House for military requirements, and the removal of Sarim-ud-Douleh to another courtyard. Without waiting to resign, the Prince left Shiraz in a temper for his home at Isfahan on July 14th. Meanwhile the elections were suspended, the object of one section of the * democrats ' being to force a new election. On August 13th M. Tompakoff,.the Russian Soviet Consul in Sl)iraz t closed the Consulate and returned to Tehran. During his year's residence in Shiraz he had been active in communist propaganda among the more extreme politicians, newspaper writers and a limited circle of acquaintances : he had also held several large gatherings to celebrate anniversaries of the Soviet, at which lengthy speeches explanatory of the internal and external policy of the Soviet were' made ; but presumably the absence of any Russian subjects in Shiraz and of direct Russian interests made it unprofitable for the Soviet Gov ernment to maintain a representative for the time, as the archives have been sealed and handed to the custody of the provincial government. Early in August His Highness Nusrat-ud-Douleh, G.C.M.G., eldest sou of prince Farman .Farma, was appointed Governor-General and arrived in Shiraz. From all points of view his term of office was a great improvement on those of his predecessors. The working of the provincial secretariat had fallen into confusion under the indolent regime of the opium-smoking Sarim- ud-Douleh, who in :an endeavour to win popular favour by ultra-democratic manners in the end pleased nobody and quarrelled with not a few : letters would remain unanswered for months on one excuse or another. Nusrat-ud- Douleh, besides being one of the most alert of the younger politicians of Persia,, is a hard worker, and possesses real talents for administration. From the pcftnt of view of British interests I must record my appreciation, for His Highness has dealt expeditiously with claims and correspondence, and done his best to. settle outstanding cases. His attitude throughout has been very friendly to British subjects in general as well as to the Consulate, and he has more than once hinted that he desired to recover the good opinion of His Majesty's Legation. He rapidly gathered all threads of the provincial administration into his own hands, and skilfully checked the signs of military predominance and interference in civil affairs. His first efforts, aided by the delegation from Tehran of a special commissioner of enquiry into the burning of the ballot-box, were directed to the completion of the elections for Shiraz, and then in the Outlying districts of Fars. In the result it can hardly be said that the fourteen deputies sent to the fifth Majlis are representative of the voice of the people, or travelled and enlightened men. Those chosen for the five seats for Shiraz town and district were all turbaned folk, with a clerical upbringing. The two great magnates of Fars, Soulat-ud-Douleh and Qawam-ul-Mulk, each from identical motives of neutralizing in Tehran the latent hostility and in fluence of the other, while as representatives of the nation protecting them selves from pressure by the Central Government, had themselves elected for district and tribal constitutencies : both now appear' to have repented of the intentions to proceed to Tehran, and to have resigned in favour of the nm- ners-up. The two deputies for Dashtistan and Bushire obtained their election by intimidation on the part of local agents, and are dangerous firebrands- and intriguers. Indeed eight of the fourteen deputies for Fars and the Gulf Ports are men with a bad angiophobe record, and members of the extremist democrat or i nationalist ' party. Another step taken by Nusrat-ud-Douleh has been to increase the number of districts with sub-governors directly reporting and responsible to the Governor-General, and this has tended to extend the influence of the provincial administration. At the end of 1923 the Government of Behbehan and the Kuhgilu, for 13 years an appanage of the Bakhtiari, was replaced under Fars : lack of communications between Shiraz and Behbehan, however, gives the provincial government difficulty in establishing contract. Except for Ahmadi, which is under Bushire, all the former powerful chief tains along the Bushire-Shiraz road, have lost influence and been harried by the authorities of Fars during the year. His Highness, elected both for Kermanshah and for Tehran, decided in March 1934 to relinquish his post aud take his seat in the Majlis, Though hisperslot gulf political resideitcy, 1923. 19 expenditure has been greatly in excess of the 1,500 Tnmans (£300), the present emoluments of the position, it is understood that the next appointment will be on a much lower scale, and it is difficult to imagine how the Governor-G-eneral will be able to keep up the position and necessary influence without making money by underhand and illicit means. M ilitary A ffairs. Turning to military administration, the force in Fars and tl]e Gulf Ports has been increased, chiefly by recruits sent from Kerman, to about 2,000 officers and men, by now fairly well-drilled though not altogether well-found in uniform and accoutrements. This figure does not cover the detachment in Behbehan and the Kuhgilu, which has been organized by the Divisional Command in Isfahan^ and may total some 300 effectives. By March 1924 the force in Shiraz had dwindled to a ration strength of 404 subordinate officers and men, and some 3p officers, owing to the rest being absent on expeditionary work. Military activities in Fars have been as follows :— (i) In the spring of 1923 a force from Isfahan penetrated to the north west boundary of the province, occupied the.district of Simirun and the summer-quarters of some of the Qashqai and the Kuhgiiu : with the exception of some 200 men left in the Kuhgilu the rest were subsequently withdrawn, after hostages had been taken and heavy fines levied from the principal district chiefs. {ii) In June the chieftain of Humaijan, Mir Abbas., was summoned to destroy the forts, and subsequently arrested in Shiraz. On the refusal of his sons to obey, a force of 350 men with guns was sent out from Shiraz in July : they were resisted, and lost 27 killed and wounded before breaches were made by gunfire in the strong chain ^ of forts, and the rebels fled. • The force then proceeded to super intend the destruction of towers of the Dushmanziari, Jawi, Kustam in the Mamasanni country and of Kashkuli towers in the neighbourhood of Humaijan, and took drastic steps against the chiefs by imprisonment, fines and looting of villages,- which brought about a marked return to security in that lawless region. Mir M^kur and other sons of Mir Abbas, having taken to the hills as outlaws, defied a cavalry detachment and local levies sent to round them up, plundered caravans and from November to March again established themselves in some of the Humaijan forts, despite the military post in the vicinity. Moreover, their father, taken out in December by the intervention of a Mulla and ( democrat ' leader to induce his sons to surrender, escaped from his guards owing perhaps to connivance of the party, and rejoined the rest of the band. Their ruthless treatment of caravans belonging to their enemies by March 1924 made a certain area 50 miles from Shiraz somewhat unsafe. The Brigadier-General found it impracticable and too costly to take active measures against Imam Quli Khan, chief of the Rustam clan of Mamasanni, who had so stoutly with stood a force in 1922, and decided to treat with him for voluntary submission. (in) In October 1923 the arrival near Shiraz of Soulat-ud-Douleh on the tribal migration south was made the occasion for a demonstration to impress the Qashqai chieftain in the shape of manoeuvres at which he was entertained with ceremony and officials and notables of Shiraz were guests. The policy of the central government and of the military towards Soulat-ud-Douleh has remained that of the ' velvet glove ', and the 1 steel*hand ' has not been disclosed. But, notwithstanding the countenance given him in his action against the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy., Ltd.j in'September, and the actual support in 'his candidature for the Majlis at Jahrum in November, there are signs that he is uneasy at the ultimate inten tions of the central government towards him. He was called upon to pay arrears of revenue amounting to 300,000 Tumans and thought it advisable to make no difficulty about compromising for the pay T ment of 130 ; 000 b^ instalments; and full revenue for the current20 ANNUAL. REPORT OF THE year : and it is understood that tlie central government are making enquiries as to the validity of the grants on which he holds—some say illegally—the large domains from which he draws his wealth. If so, he may before long illustrate in his person the justice of the second part of a rhyme in Turki current among his own Qashqais, as he has hitherto that of the first part :—' Geujin war mllkin ne lar e, geujin yok milkin ne lar e'—when you have power, what's the good of having property (you can take whose you like), when you have no power, what's the good of property. (iv) Towards his rival Qawam-ul-Mulk the military attitude has been stiffer. To reassure the Minister of War of his good faith and obedience to control he voluntarily surrendered in July the old Turkish mountain and field-guns lent to his late father in 1916 by the British Government for the purpose of quelling the insurrection at Shiraz : and he further entered his eldest boy in the Cavalry. But in July the expeditionary detachment harried his tenants in Dushmanziari wihout paying any respect to his feelings : and in the latter part of September, on his going to Isfahan to meet the Minister of War and express his readiness to obey any commands, Sardar Sipah indicated that he would prefer Qawara-ul-Mulk to reside at Tehran, and quit Fars. Qawam-ul-Mulk undoubtedly contemplates the likelihood of the central government depriving hini of his hereditary government of eastern Fars, and of the Khamseh tribes as well : and from October to December 1923 he was pro jecting a tour in Europe to escape from his difficulties, but this was cancelled by the Ministry of Finance ordering him to eastern Fars to recover revenue. (v) In November a detachment of some 600 men with 2 guns and 4 machine-guns was sent to the large district of Dashti lying between the first coast range and the sea, which had not paid revenue regularly if at all for some twelve years, and has fallen into great disorder. The detachment met with no opposition from the local chieftains and remained collecting revenue, which was finally com promised at the scheduled rate for two years (some 23,000 Tumans) till the middle of January when they returned to Burazjun, leaving at Khurmuj, the chief village, a garrison of some 150 soldiers which subsequently had to be withdrawn. {vi) Early in February 1924 the Chief of the Persian General Staff, Brigadier-General Amanullah Mirza, returned from Europe via Shiraz bringing with him to Bushire several aeroplanes, Citroen cars and war material, which it has hitherto been impossible to bring up-country owing to weight and the impracticability of the road for mechanical and wheeled transport. Up to the date of this report two aeroplanes, flown by French instructors engaged for the purpose, had reached Shiraz and both have been damaged by falls. (vii) On February 12th the expeditionary detachment, mentioned in sub section (v), about 600 men left Kazerun via Mamasanni in the direction of Behbehan. Its objective is believed to be the disarma ment of the Boir Ahmadi tribe of the Kuhgilu. (viii) In December notices were posted, ordering the inhabitants of o surrender their firearms or obtain licenses. This has been followed by another order for permits, with photographs of bearers, to be taken out for shot guns. Hitherto the number of arms surrendered by the populace has been small. For some time the intention of the military to proceed to the disarmament bloc of the two nomad tribes, Qashqai and Khamseh, has been current, but it is generally apprehended, even by military officers, that the operation can hardly be radical, as the more modern and valuable weapons may be hidden for the time being. In terminating this section of the report it may be remarked that in the eyes of the public of Fars the prestige of the existing force is in March 1924 perhaps hardly as high as in the summer of 1923. Their operations have been superficial rather than thorough : and there has been a certain amount of friction among the higher officers. Those who have had a European education as wellpersian gulf political eesldettcy; 1923. 21 as training are inclined to view the e^-Cossack officers from'the north as amateurs without a grasp of military discipline, punctuality, straightforward ness and administration, and not real soldiers : the various elements from whicJi officers and men have come, Russian-trained Cossack Brigade, Swedish-trained Gendarmerie, and Bntish-tramed S. P. E. doubtless do not always l.lend well and the irregular life led by some highly placed officers does not produce a good effect on the civil population. In December a number of officers of the garrison were arrested imprisoned or sent away, on the ground that they had fomed a plot to seize the Brigadier-General. The last-named, Fazlullah Khan Zahidi certainly is an ambitious politician, and appears more concerned with political intrigues than the military programme. From the beginning of March 192+ with the assistance of a handful of ' democrats ' of the extrfme party he has movement Varl0US S P 0 P^e to give an adherence to the republican C ommunications. Early in January 1923 the Ministry of Public Works began to impose tolls oil animal transport on the bhiraz-Kazerun section of the road to BusUnv i 11 ! a f t0 H ls Majesty's Legation against the breach of Article if the Anglo-Persian Commercial Convention of 1903, which laid down that (once the customs duties at the frontier had been paid on goods) tolls or other exactions might not be imposed except on - carriage-able ' roads, and then only after the completion of a road (for wheeled traffic) or of its principal sec tions as regards such sections. Supported by both technical and practical evidence that the caravan track was not 44 carriage-able ' throughout its length oi tin oughout the year, neither horse-driven vehicles nor motor-lorries ever having been able to use the track for the transport of merchandize on account of the gradients and passes up to 7,800 feet in a length of 180 miles, British official opinion considered the levy of tolls before the necessarily costly ex penditure on levelling had begun injurious to British treaty rights : from another point of view Persian mercantile opinion objected to the toils on the ground that the money would neither be employed to improve the condition of the road nor benefit the transport trade, but be diverted to other uses by officials and the government ; .while muleteers broke up the toll-gates when first put up and protested vigorously to Tehran. The central government was however deaf to all remonstrances, ignored the British contention that the road could not possibly be termed 4 4 carriage-able '—during the rainy season each year the 10 miles of marsh behind Bushire cannot be crossed by any vehicle—and con tinued to levy tolls on the Shiraz-Kazerun section. The cost of the scanty sur face repairs did not exceed 8,000 Tumans (£1,600), and the bulk of the monev taken was transferred to the Ministry of Finance, Tehran ; the number of journeys by light passenger cars, chiefly Fords, which, using the now worn-out track made by Indian troops in 1919, were able to reach Bushire from Shiraz and vice- versa in the six good months of the year, was not above 50. Such passenger cars did not of course benefit trade. By the end of 1923, with' the vigorous policy of the new Persian Govern ment in Tehran, new factors had arisen. Not only did they desire to improve means of communication between the' capital and the sea for military reasons but also apparently to emancipate themselves from the route via Iraq and have an all-Persian route to the sea ; a German-Persian transport company had been floated in Tehran to undertake the carriage of goods by motor-lorries (out of the question as long as the gradients on the passes had not been improved by scientific engineering) ; and the Persian Government was importing war material, to the transit of which via Iraq there was presumably some objection. A Commission headed by the Minister of Public Works and one of the United States Advisers was therefore sent to make a report on the cost and technical requirements for reconstruction of the Bushiro-Shiraz road for mechanical transport, and arrived at Shiraz in January 1924. As it happened the delega tion met with heavy rains, and had difficulty in getting their cars (with the aid of man-handling) over the marshy part of the road. The opinion formed by the delegation on its return was understood to be that at least £100,000 would be required to make the road initially practicable for heavy mechanical transport (a British engineer officer in 1921 had estimated £250,000 o'r more); and that even then long detours, cutting out Kazarun from the existing alignment, would have to be constructed. The British (and local Persian) objection to the justice LeeiFD @ f i itiiiiitffiu'I 22 ANNUAL, EEFOBT OF TUB of levying tolls would thus appear to have been proved. At the end of the period under report the position was that no wheeled traffic was possible owing to the damage done by the winter rains, that tolls were still being levied, and that two European engineers were being employed between Bushire and Kazarun to improve the bad corners on the passes (at a cost of some £2,000) sufficiently to enable the Persian Government war material to be taken inland. Further, an opium merchant, Shirazi by origin, naturalized British in Hongkong, had offered to take up a concession to make the road and spend some £60,000 on it in three years ; and a Parsee firm in Bombay had sent to Bushire a number of passenger motor-cars in anticipation of permission to run a service. The interest of the Persian Government in improving this road is as much to be desired for the benefit of foreign trade as for the internal needs of the Government : but the point is that from a purely engineering outlook it cannot be improved to benefit trade without a large sum of money being expended. Already there is a movement of protest by Shiraz politicians against the first railway being built from Muhammerah inland, instead of through Fars. In another branch of communications—Posts and Telegraphs—similar pro gress has not been shown, and the service from Bushire to Isfahan is now worse than for several vears past. Under the new regulations by the United States ad visers all receipts have to.be paid in to the local Bank for the credit of the Central Administration ; but the remittances from Tehran for local expenditure are neither regular nor sufficient. In consequence these services are starved and function with difficnlty, wages of the staffs being constantly in arrears. From Tanuarv 5th to 28th the Posting Contractor on the Shiraz-Istahan section struck to forward mails, and in March 1924 still cla ms some 17 000 Tumans (£3,400) from the administration for arrears and accounts unpaid. Ihe contractor from Bushire to Shiraz has also arrears due to him. Owing to orders from Tehran that no more than 100 maunds (736 lbs.) o.. parcels were to be forwarded at a time, from December 1923 to end of February 1924, parcels accumulated in Bushire to the extent of 7 tons, in Shiraz 4 tons, and lay thoie. Strong and repeated representations were made through His Majesty s Lega tion both by the' Residency at Bushire and the Consulate at Shiraz, and the accumulation was fairly well cleared by the beginning of March. This faulty administration prejudiced the use of the postal service by traders for merchan- dtTthe heater part of which was from Great Britain and India. Urgent repairs to the telegraph buildings have also been denied the funds required.

It is with .great difficulty that foreign merchants can bring their claims to a hearing in the recently created Foreign Section of the Governor-GeneraPs office (since economy on the part of the Persian Government has abolished the Karguzarate) and in almost all cases a compromise has to be accepted for a portion of the'debt in lieu of the whole, because that is the line taken by the Persian merchant assessors called in, who have no sense of pronouncing a claim either whollv good or whollv bad. Under the Governor-Generalship of Nusrat-ud-Douleh British subiects have had more attention than previously, but some claims still await the neces sary pressure, and settlement in others has been 4 fante de mieux / A complete written code of laws defining penalties and obligations such as the Ottoman Law in Turkey, does not yet exist in Persia ; nor can that portion already existing be enforced, for the reason that no arrangements for the exe cution of judgments and decrees exist. The whole question is fundamental for the foreign subject and trader (as it is for Persia), because in commercial matters the European foreigner can have no sense of security in investing his'money in Persian economic development and has to proceed with the greatest caution on terms of short credit or by other means in the sale of goods, and because the European foreigner could not live without great risk of oppression and without resorting to bribery like the natives of the country, were ^ extra-territorial jurisriction and treaty rights abolished, as the Persian nationalists and newspapers often urge on their Government. The Press of Shiraz—There is no doubt that the rise of the Press to great power in Persia has contributed to a reawakening of the national sentiment and a desire for reforms and modern development among the townspeople and a certain proportion of the literates outside the towns. The newspapers have been tireless in preaching the need for better and more extended educational facilities throughout the country, possibly not foreseeing the result when numbers of boys reach manhood without prospect of earning their livelihood owing to the total lack of industrial concerns, and disinclination to follow the trades of their fathers. In warning their countrymen against the evils of foreign intervention and reliance on foreign economic assistance, the newspapers have* perhaps done a service to foreign countries as well as to their own. But the licence of the Press of Shiraz, as opposed to the liberty of the Press, the utter disregard of the Press Law, organised blackmail, pursuit of personal vendettas, abusive language and reckless slanders on private persons and officials have just as /certainly harmed the morale of the inhabitants of Fars. Against any youthful publisher of a news-sheet they are defenceless. In Shiraz there are now nine or ten papers fpr a reading public in the pro vince of perhaps 2,000 persons, and the average number of copies of each printed weekly 300 to 400 ; three of the editors are under the age required by the Press Law, two only have been for short periods outside the province, and three have a smattering of English. The book of ' Democrat Policy ' printed in Bombay about 1912 is said to lay down many excellent principles ; but those who know both state that these principles and rules are broken and disregarded by the various lodges which now describe themselves as 44 democrats ' (variatim ' nationalists ') in Fars. There may be some 2,000 affiliated members in Shiraz and the provincial -town- ehips, but not more than 200 active participants, and the movement would collapse if it were not for some 30 or 40 enthusiasts, who make use of it to obtain a stranglehold on the administration of the province, promote their private schemes, benefit themselves, render themselves immune from suppression ; while the rank and file affiliated to the movement obtain the support of the leaders when in difficulties. To quote the paper ' Gulistan ' in July the following list of Committees and Clubs in Shiraz (population about 35,000) is given ' so that all may know the confusion now prevailing in this town -(1) Western Democ rats (2) Eastern Democrats, () 3 True Democrats, (4) Real Democrats, (5) Independent Democrats, (6) Eastern Islamic Union, (7) Western Islamic Union, (8) Islamic Nationalists, (9) Communist Committee, (10) Socialist Democrats, and so on up to 21. several of them with not more than 20 members, and these constantly drifting apart in antagonism and rivalry.24 AUTNUAIi EEPOET OF THB The editors, who are free lanees, with the thirty ' democrat ' or ' nationalist ' leailers now dominate the attitude of the province, and tie the hands of the civil administration to an extent impossible and unbelievable in most countries • there is no such thing as public opinion, and the rest of the population, while often chafing at the domination of such persons, is cowed and afraid to make itself heard for fear of spoken and printed abuse or threats. ' The editors of 4 Gulistan,' ' Asr-i-Azadi,'' Istakhr,' ' Khurshid-i-Iran ' have made it part of their personal creed to be violently anti-British on every possible occasion. Since British policy during the past two years has been complete abstention from intervention in Persian internal affairs, these men are generally forced to go outside Persia to find fuel to keep alive-a sentiment of antagonism among their readers to everything British. Thus in the past year, in March and April 1923, the murder in a bloodfeud of a Tangistani chief, who had opposed us at Bushire in the war, was not only stated by these papers to have been instigated by the British, but for several weeks formed a pretext for a passionate outburst against everything British. The deputy for Bushire in the Majlis telegraphed to the papers of Shiraz calling for revenge. The editor of ' Gulistan' organized a ' pilgrimage ' to the site of the graves of 14 Persians serving in the South Persia Rifles, executed in 1918 for treachery and murdering a British Captain and Sergeant, and delivered orations from the pulpits. For months these papers have published lying statements of British ill- treatment of the Persians resident in Bahrain, urging the Government to assert full sovereignty over these Arab islands, and obtain the wealth of the pearl fisheries. From July to November the papers mentioned called on Islam to join in a holy war against the British, who had expelled the Shiah religious leaders from Iraq in order to humiliate the Shiah religion. In October there was a public demonstration of respect and sympathy, ordered by the central government, for the Arab Mujtahid, Sheikh Mehdi-el-Khalisi, who after being deported from Iraq passed through Shiraz on his way to join at Qum other members of the Shiah clergy of Mesopotamia who had made a voluntary exodus to Persia. Despite the evidence to the contrary and the knowledge of the Ulema concerned that their quarrel had been with the Arab Government of Iraq and not with the British representative in Baghdad, the circumstances were distorted by the news paper writers, anglophobes and clericals into a charge of oppression by the British Government, and in Shiraz the passage of the cleric was made the occasion for a fresh outburst of anti-British sentiment. The failure of a mail-steamer to wait for post-bags at Bnndar Abbas was said to be an attempt to damage the Persian postal service ; the British quaran tine doctors in the Persian Gulf were alleged to have pocketed 12,000 Tumans for examining corpses sent for burial to the Shrines ; Arabistan was represented in a series of articles in the ' Istakhr ' to be entirely under the control of the ' fishermen of London ' ; the Imperial Bank of Persia was declared to have paid not a single penny to the Persian Government as royalty for 36 years. More virulent and troublesome still have been some of the so-called transla tions from Indian extremist papers, such as 'Zamindar' of Lahore, ' Al-JamaV of Calcutta and others, with astounding misrepresentations, e.g., one-third ot the population of India, in which the women are gradually included, are m the British prisons ' and the reports that the British were being driven out of India bv a general revolution. These Shirazi editors out-Herod Herod m their constant prlssnre for the complete removal of all British interest from India, Iraq and Esfvpt. In March 1924 the editors had meetings with two delegates of the Khilafat Committee for India, on their way to Angora. What the impres sion conveyed to the simple reader in Fars who does not learn the real tacts of the position may be, it can only he imagined. Even in such a remote internal matter as the demand for a Bepulfo^wMch on the suggestion of newspapers in Tehran is now being torced on the fhirazis bv this little party of editors and ' democrat leaders with military stump orators are dragging in their' Anglophobia charging against the Qajar Shahs that they gave the British the concessions to t he European Telegraph Department, the Imperial Bank ot Persia, the ^g ) Persian Oil Company, Limited, and have deprived Persia of as (jVer }[' ( , ar ,l in the pearl fisheries of the Gulf.

Any Persian • affecting sympathies or relations with the British is denounced by these men as a 4 traitor Officials in Fars, are friendly, recognizing the correctness and disinterested ness of the British attitude towards Persian affairs ; merchants and resident notables equally so, recognizing the value of the friendly relations to which they have been used for decades past ; the heart of the people is as a whole sound. Only we are faced with the extraordinary position of a small hand of malignant men leading by the nose the rest of the province in a policy of ill-will towards Great Britain aiid everything British ; and they have gone to such extremes for so loiig that it is unlikely they will turn over a new leaf, unless given a strong and compelling lead. Neither has the central government stepped in to cheek the movement in Fats, nor is there any section of the Press of persons of position courageous enough to contradict the views of this band. To anyone with long years of friendship and sympathy with Persians of all classes, the continuance i)f this propaganda and terrorizing of local opinion is saddening. British Interests. —With the exception of 1 sabotage ' among the tribal guards at the site of the drilling in September, which was undoubtedly the result of intrigue by Soulat-ud-Douleh and other Qashqai chiefs, and which obliged the work to be suspended for some two months, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, have made good progress with their exploration for oil at Bikarz-Mishun in the Nailati hills. A Persian naturalized in Great Britain has also formed a limited company at Manchester for the sale of piecpgoods to Sh^raz and other places. s » At the request of Colonel Trevor I am sending two copies of this report to Bushrro for use in compiling his annual Administration Report of the Residency in the Persian Gulf ; you will no doubt warn him if you consider any portion cofiflicts in any way with your views. Kcte on events Bikarz Area during 1923. 1. General.—In the early past of the year good progress was made in development and the unmetalled motor road from Ganowah to Mishun (61) miles was completed on February 8th when a car first completed the through joirney. Drilling was actively proceeded with in two areas and made good progress di spite the unfortunate stoppage of all work during September and October referred to below. Work was stopped from September 11th to October 29th and much damage ceased. Since the resumption of work conditions have improved steadily and g(od progress is being made. 2. Political. —Conditions at Ganowah have always been most satisfactory, thnnks to the constant friendliness and assistance of Haidar Khan, C.I.E. In the forward area of Bikarz political conditions in the early part of the year were difficult and became gradually impossible, culminating in the forcible stoppage of work by the Kashkulis from September 11th to the 29th October, Family dissensions amongst the Khans oyer money paid by the Company, and over positions of authority in the District, gave the Sardar Ashair (Saulat) the opportunity he needed to break the power of the Kashkulis and upset their agreement with the Company. In this endeavour he was deliberate and com pletely successful. The Persian Government watched developments with approval as they coincided fortunately with their policy of breaking up tribal power generally. When appealed to, the Persian Government disclaimed responsibility for past events but accepted responsibility for security in the future, thus marking the end of tribal agreements. For the first time for many years Government found itself in a position to assume responsibilitv and to send troops into the area.. An officer and 9 men arrived Bikarz on October 9th Accompanied by 5^ tribal (Kashkuli) guardu provided by the Saulat under their orders. Work has proceeded satisfactorily^ AjKTKTTAL BEfPORT OF THE' since and the area is qnietly being settled.

Shuja Nizam, C.T E held the post of Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas till 5th June, when ho' was succeeded by Agha Hassan Hoshiyar, Salar-i-Nizam, with the title of Gov ernor of Bandar Abbas and Minab. The Bandar Abbks post is no longer under the Governor of the Gulf Ports, but has been transferred to the direct control of the Minister of the Interior * at Tehran, by whom the present incumbent was nominated. It will be observed that it has been raised to a ' Hakumut ' and that Minab has been included in its jurisdiction. Shuja Nizam though illiterate was a practical and experienced administra tor. He was well disposed towards this Consulate and his proclivities were decidedly pro-British, but he was not able to do much, being in a constant state of nervousness owing to the uncertainty of his position. In his present retreat at Rudan, he still casts covetous eyes in the direction of Bandar Abbas, and quite recently, after remitting a heavy bribe to Tehran thought he had regained his former post and actually made preparations to assume charge. It would appear, Shuja Nizam was duped by his so-called agent who fled the country after encashing a draft for 5,650 Tomans sent him for the purpose of securing the post. 1 . Salar-i-Nizam has held appointments as Deputy Governor at Sakiz and Baneh respectively about ten years ago. As a Military Officer he served at Kermanshah under the Nizam-es-Sultaneh who afterwards obtained for him the Commissionership of Police in Kurdistan The impression so far created is that he is weak and incompetent and reports also credit mm with being corrupt. On assuming charge in June last, he assured His Britannic Maiesty's Consul ot his Inendly inclinations towards the British and expressed a desire for close co-operation with this Consulate. His administration-so far has not justmed his earlier professions. Although receiving advice and assistance from His Britannic Maiesty's Consul, on several occasions, Salar-i-Nizam has not done much to settle out- standing claims of British subjects m his district.7 ?t2rsian gulf political residency, 1923.

The latter has made several attempts to appoint one or other of his satellites bu{ these have proved unsuccessful owing to the stout opposition offered by the townspeople. As a result, the town has been left uncared for and is in a deplorably insani tary condition. P ersian A rmy. Bandar Ahhas.—The first outward and visible sign of the existence of a Rational Army in Persia was evidenced in this district by the arrival at Bandar- Abbas from Kerman on the 22nd January of a detachment of 130 infantry under the command of Naibs Amanullah Khan ^nd Sohrab Khan.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1923. 29 TRe troops were met outside the town by the Deputy Govern'or and local officials as also by a huge concourse of the inhabitants, and were accorded an enthusiastic reception. The men were accommodated in a house formerly occupied by the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia. It is situated about 300 yards from His Britannic Majesty's Consulate and has smce been established as the Head quarters of the Bandar Abbas ' Kushun.' Their equipment was a mixture of that of the late Swedish Gendermerie and to the fcouth Persia Rifles, from the remnants of both of which the men had apparently been recruited. Local guards at the ^ Hakumat,' Imperial Bank and the Finance Depart ment, hitherto consisting of tufangchis, were taken over by Persian regulars. Shortly after arrival, the Rais-i-Kushun introduced the ' Curfew Order.' This led to interference with British subjects and townspeople alike but owing to representations made by His Britannic Majesty's Consulate the order was lescmtied., 20 Baluch Sowars were enlisted in March. The Infantry detachment was distributed in the neighbouring districts to protect the caravan routes, and about 30 men were stationed at Minab. The result was that complaints of extortion by the Surbazes immediately began to pour in. The presence of persian troop^ at Minab addedio the troubles of the in habitants who were now preyed upon by both Baluchis and Sarbazes. On one occasion in March when the looting of 8 camels was reported near Eudkhaneh Soor, the Sarbazes who were despatched after the robbers beat the Kaiantar of Rezwan and arrested the Kattldiuda of Kalkazi. The latter was released after investigation of the case. Illtreatment of the troops at Bandar Abbas by the Officer Comn^mding caused a number of Sarbazes to take ^ Bast ' in the Telegraph Office on the lltii March and complain to Kerman. They x return)ed to their barracks on receiving an assurance that an officer from Kerman would be deputed to enquire into their grievance. Several complaints were received during March on account of excesses being committed in the town by Sarbazes. Bandar Abbas was en fete on the occasion of the visit on inspection on the 28th March of Sarhang Mahomed Khan, Commanding at Kerman, who was accompanied by four ollicers and 30 Sowars. Mohamed Khan was met by the Deputy Governor at Nakhl-el-Nakhuda and received a tremendous ovation from the inhabitants who turned out to welcome him and assembled in front of the ' Kushun. ' The flag staffs in the town were decorated by day and illuminated by night. A salute of 11 guns announced the arrival of the Colonel. As the result of his intvestigations locally about 20 Sarbazes were very severely flogged and two sent to Kerman in chains. Sarhang Mohamed Khan departed for Kerman on April 1st leaving Sultan Abdul Husain Mirza in command at Bandar Abbas. During May sickness prevailed amongst the troops and the whole of the original detachment was invalided and the garrison recruited locally. On June 28th Naib Ali Asghar Khan relieved Sultam Abdul Husain Mirza in command. Under instructions from Tehran, the Police force of tufangchis was abolished in August and its duties transferred to the regulars. Disarmament of the local inhabitants was decided upon by the Central authorities but on further consideration the orders sent to the Rais-i-Kushun were countermanded. • , . „ Unaah —Yawar Mi Asghar Khan arrived from Bushire on the 6th Septem ber to establish a garrison. He brought 60 men under a subaltern Naib Mumr Huzoor. His arrival caused a great impression in the town. The local merchants called on the Major and conveyed general satisfaction of the townspeople at the arrival of Persian troops. r + i, * At a reception held, patriotic speeches were made m which a Nationalist hot head Pxnrpssed a hope that Bahrein and Oman would be recovered from th« British by the Persian Army. UUfDso ANNUAL REPORT OF TBE C ondition of the country. Bandar Ahfyas. —The town itself was remarkably free from crime, in spite of there being no organised Police Force. The duties of maintaining peace and good order were perlormed by the Governor's tufattgchis. No murders were recorded. A burglary is said to have been committed in the Persian Post Office in February and a sum of Twenty-five tomans lifted. Two important cases of theft were reported in May. In the first of these property worth 2,000 Krans was removed from the house of a British Indian Pahlaj, and in the other 4,000 Krans in cash were stolen from the house of Mr. Vaz of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited. These cases were brought to the notice of the Deputy Governor, whose en quiries failed to trace the perpetrators, or to recover the stolen property. A party of Bahichis from Minab raided Khajita on the night of the 12th May and carried away six camels. These were afterwards restored. -The district has been comparatively quiet throughout the year. ;On the 7th June 7 donkeys were robbed at Kong but were recovered a day or go later. A burglary was attempted on the night of the 22nd-23rd October on the premises of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited, by an employee of the Company and the Manager seriously injured. The burglar Ghulam Qambar surrendered himself to the Consular Agent and was handed over to the local authorities. He was tried and sentencea to receive 100 lashes and to undergo a month's imprisonment. On the 7th December a murder was committed at Shinlas, four mile's west of Lingah. Minab—A chronic state of insecurity prevailed throughout the year.in the town and district, which were as usual exposed to depudations from Biyaban and Bashakird. In spite of the presence of a garrison at Minab, very little attention appears to have paid to the condition of this district. The notorious Ibrahim Khan and Abbas Khan were fairly active, undoubt edly encouraged by the indifference shown by local Acting Deputy Goveror and of the Governor of Bandar Abbas, During April and May the state of affairs in that quarter grew so serious that the more important merchants, Persian and Indian decided to quit the town and come in to Bandar Abbas, Tribal Warfare between Mir Barakat of Biyaban and Zargham-es-Sultaneh of Rudbar in October added to the troubles of th6 district. On the 4th October fighting took place Jagin between Bashakirdis and Rudbaris in which the former led by Mir Barakat were worsted, losing 30 men in killed and 15 wounded. The casualties amongst Zargham followers did not exceed 4 killed and one man wounded. The trouble arose through Barakat looting livestock and dates belonging to Minab is, and his son at the same time raiding Sarneh and Karium and demanding payment of his mother-in-law's dowry from Zargham. Jogin was occupied by Zargham and Mir Barakat withdrew to Kohistaq, Zargham shortly afterwards occupied Minab at the invitation of the in- habitants. Later, his men advanced against Kohistaq and in the fighting that ensued, he severely punished Mir Barakat whose casualties were estimated at 26 killed and 8 wounded as against 3 killed and 10 wounded on the side of the attackers. Kohistaq was nearly captured and was only saved by Zargham's force being compelled to retire owing to treachery and shortage of ammunition. Zargham was eventually compelled under orders of the Kerman Military authorities to evacuate Minab and return to his own country.V PERSIAST GULP POLITICAL residency, 1923. 31 Condition of roads.

The authorities were requested to take action which resulted m the return of the Ghulam's wife. On May 10th, fifty bags of loaf sugar belonging to British Indian Merchants were robbed from a Baluch caravan of Serzah on this road. A part of the booty was recovered later by the Kalantar of Shamil, whose men killed three of the robbers and wounded two others. Bashakirdi tribesmen raided Shamil as a reprisal for the action taken. * Mine.}). —As in 1922, all the roads leading from Minab were unsafe during |he year and robberies have been frequent In April Agha Hassan, contractor of the bazar and 44 Pahsalari ' taxes at Minb travelling to Rudbar for the purpose of selling rifles, met third Eudbari tufangchis, who were supposed to have been guarding the road, at Murad Kushtek 'While having tea with the turfaiigchis the contractor and his servant were shot dead and money and his rifles carried away. The looted property was recovered through Zargham and handed over to the murdered man's heirs. A reward for the capture of the murderers was offered and two of these were apprehended by a certain Mirza Ibrahim Bashakirdi. On November 15th, some Lari, merchants returning from Mlnab to Bandar Abbas were attacked on the road by Baluch highwaymen, and robbed of 1,000 tomans in cash. The Rais-i-Kushun was despatched to recover the looted property, but failed to do so.

Trade and Commerce. Bandar Ahhas—There was a slight improvement m trade during the past year, both imports and exports showing a small increase over the two preceding years. Foreion exchange has been steadier thus enabling merchants to transact their business with more confidence- The latter cleared their expenses in 1922 but their returns for the past year should show some profit. No failures have been recorded during 1923. The local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia has-been able tobuy a sufficient amount of Foreign exchange to allow of it selling to importers ot foreign goods at a fairly low average rate for the year. It was thought that the opening of the Duzdap rouet would divert from Bandar Abbas the bulk of imports destined for the interior that ^sed hitherto to be introduced through the latter. It is not found that the trade of Bandar Abbas has so far been affected to any appreciable extent. Goods despatched via the Duzdap route take as long to reach their destination as through Bandar Abbas, but the former is the more expensive route ^Dur g November and December fh^ D uz^t V roi^ considered to be unsafe and one or two caravans reported to have been robbed.. peesian gulf political eesidency, 1923. 33 'F? 16 P ros P erit y of Bandar Abbas depends almost entirely on its use as a dis- tnbutmg centre for import into Soutliern x Persia and the handling of export from the interior for shipment. &amp; ^ The local trade is small and unimportant. Very serious inconvenience and embarrassment to British Indian importers was caused early in the year by the promulgation of a Persian Law prohibiting the export of silver rupees by sea from Persian Ports in the Gulf and levying an embargo on the export of all specie in Cabotage. Merchants were not able to avail themselves of making remittances by the Money Order system through the British Post Office, to which the above orders, also applied. The result was that large cash balances belonging to the British Post Offices at Bandar Abbas and Lingah were held up in the case of former up to first week in September. In June the Mejliss amended the law raising the embargo against the export of rupees and of specie in cabotage, but the Director of Customs did not receive his instructions till the 10th July. The British Indian Steam Navigation maintained a regular weekly service both from Bombay as well as from Basrah, and vessels of Messrs. Frank Strick &amp; Co., called'once a month at the port direct from London via Antwerp. Fifty steamers other than mail steamers and all under the British flag, called at Bandar Abbas during the year. Lingah. —There w r as a good pearling season with fair prices. ' Business in general was better than in 1922- The boat building yards were busy throughout the year. About forty boats, of different sizes were^built, fourteen of winch were to the order of people on the Oman Coast. About 5,247 donkeys arrived from Lar during the period under review with merchandise consisjting chiefly of carpets, roses, oil seeds dried fruits and almonds. During the same period, some 12,138 camels entered the town with firewood, charcoal and sailcloth from the vicinity of Khamir, Deshgoon and Mahtahy and other places. The British India Steam Navigation Company's mail steamers called regular ly every week from Bombay and fortnightly from Basrah. 13 Vessels of other Companies all under the British flag also called at the port. Weatheb. Bandar Abhas and Lingah. —The rains were rather late but there were good falls in April and October in Bandar Abbas. Heavy rain also fell in October 111 Lingah where the water supply collected in the tanks is sufficient for the next year* The heat in Bandar Abbas at the end of May and throughout the months of June, July and August was intense and the town was practically deserted by end of June. Minab. —This district, as usual, enjoyed more rain and crops were moderate ly good. # Political Situation'. Our prestige is said to decline but no marked evidence of this-was observed during the year under review. A little capital was perhaps made by a few evil wishers in the town when the British Post Offices in the district were closed down. The policy pursued by this Consulate is one of friendly and helpful sympathy. The local Persian officials have on the whole exhibited no. overt hostility but have been found to be courteous and if anything friendly. The relations of HrMajesty's Consulate with the administration have been harmonious throughout. , , ^ ,, Thp nnmprmm anti-British demonstrations reported by Reuters and the English I^e™^\o have taken place at Tehran have not had their counterpart at.

Mujtabids in the Juma Masid was a half hearted affair and failed to rouse any enthusiasm- The novelty of the Persian Kushun having long ago waned, nobody in Bandar Abbas cares or troubles about its existence now-a-days. More importance is attached to the Army in Lingah where the Commander more or less ignores the Civil Officials and interposes his interference in purely civil cases arising amongst the inhabitants. T he P ersian M ejliss. ' Balloting for the election of a Deputy to the Mejliss at Tehran extended througout June, July and August and resulted in the return of the sitting member Haji Sayed Mahomed Baqir, Dast-i-Ghaib. The proceedings resembled anything but those of a Parliamentary election and very little interest was evinced by the man in the street. The result can hardly be said to reflect the will of the majority and was undoubtedly attained through the influence of the Governor Salar-i-Nizam. No elections were held at Ling ah. In November one, Nehmatullah arrived from Lar with ballot papers for election of one Deputy for Lar and Lingah. The townspeople declined to record their votes contending that as the interests of Lingah and Lar were not identical, there should be a separate representative in the mejliss for their town.

No- 1 well was carried to a depth of 3305 feet Progress has been disappointingly slow on account of adverse conditions and distance from sources of supply. No conclusive result has yet been reached. Towards the end of the year No. 2 Test Well was started only with a view to getting more accurate information regarding an oil show which was encoun tered at about 1600 feet in No. 1. No attempt is being made to drill a deep well and the work is progressing satisfactorily. Salt. During the year 7200 tons of NamaMan salt were shipped for the use of the Abadan Refinery. Practicallv the whole of this quantity was transported m British India Steam Navigation Compay's steamers the Company not having had a suitable vessel for the purpose at the time. Apart from salt, there is no mineral exploitation in Qishm Island. There are sulphur deposits in various parts but that mineral is either too impure or too inaccessible to justify commercial exploitation. Imperial Bank of Persia. Mr. A. B. Hutchison remained Manager of the Bandar Abbas Branch throughout the year. Commenting on the Bank's transactions, Mr. Hutchison observes that the condition of silver Krans in circulation, in Bandar Abbas and the surrounding districts is deplorable and causes not a little inconvenience to the Bank as also to the customs and merchants in general.persian gulf political residency, 1923. 35 In former years tlie local branch used to accept mutilated and light weight touns at par on behalf of the Persian Government. When collected in any quantity, such coins were sent to Tehran where they were melted and re-minted. Owing to the Persian (xovernment having declined in recent years to bear the cost of i e-minting the local branch has now been compelled to refusq accept ance of bad-coins tendered by the public. The present Manager states that he cannot sie-e any prospect of an increase an the trade of Bandar Abbas, during the coming ye&amp;r, at the same time express ing an opinion that he forsees no reason why there should be a decrease in the volume of trade. In his opinion, if oil were struck on f Qishm. Island in paying quantities., the port of Bandar Abbas would assume an important commercial position, in the Persian Clulf. / Red 'Oxide from Hormuz.

This year the attendance at the dispensary again fell off during the hot weather. Large numbers of the inhabitants left the town on account of the intense damp heat. A fair number of patients come in from the surrounding .villages for treatment and people attend on arriving with caravans from the interior.36 ANNUAL keport of the Dispensary Building. —The dispensary building is in a good state of repair. No money was expended on repairs during the year. The furniture, fittings and equipment are in a serviceable condition. Epidemics. —No epidemic diseases broke out in the station during the year.

All cases operated on recovered. . Sanitation of Town. —The sanitation of town is bad. The inhabitants prac tise no sanitation. The interior of a good many houses revearrubbish heaps and these form ample breeding places for flies. Advice given on the dangers of these conditions receives a deaf ear. Cause of the Prevalence of Malaria. —The practice of storing water in open cisterns and earthenware vessels furnish all that is necessary breeding mos quitoes. Most of the houses are provided with these cisterns and shallow wells. The water is seldom or never changed. Mosquitoes can always be found and maiaria gives the highest percentage of cases treated. Lingah. —Assistant Surgeon S. Gr. Jackson performed the duties of Quaran tine Medical Officer throughout the year. Towards the end of the year there was much trouble on account Of the out break of plague at Dubai. An exodus of the Persian colony to this coast ensued and large numbers landed at various places along the coast and found their way by land in to Lingah. The Quarantine. staff were kept busy searching the town zmd rounding up strangers. Five cases of plague were discovered of whom three died. Dispensary. —The dispensary which was formerly accommodated in the * out-house attached to the residence of the Quarantine Medical Officer was moved to a small house in the town. The attendance tends to increase steadily. The number of patients in 1923 was 2,203 as compared with 1,630 the year before and 1,521 in 1921.

For the rest it may be said he is pulling the strings all the time in order to be in favour with everybody. He was brought up in Russia and visits the Russians and keeps m with them : where locally he cannot defeat an adversary he makes terms with him. ■ He came to Kerman with the idea that he could elect asmall block of men to help mm m the Mejliss. This he found impossible^and he brought in all parties member of the Mejliss for Nishapur but it is suspected that the Prime Minister attempted to turn him out he turned to the democrates who supported him with the result 1 hat when the elections came 3 democrat members were elected. One or two of these will however probably be unseated on petition owing to the methods used. The Governor-General is now, in order to unseat one of these members, whom he elected but to whom he is no longer attached, exposing the methods which were really those which he sanctioned and used.' At the same time his various intrigues have broken the democrat party as an entity, the various sections being nearly as often against each other as together. The Governor-General desired to. proceed to Tehran to take his place as member of the Mejliss for Mshapur but it is suspected that the Prime Minister does not desire the presence in Parliament of so able a debater and parliamen tarian. Sardar Moazzam has the reputation of being the second best speaker in Parliament. Mujallal-es-Saltaneh left for Tehran at the beginning of September his relief Muazid-i-Azam arriving on the 18th of the same month. He was a member of the old school and though he held good certificates Karguzar. froin previous Consuls—he had held his i • i o appointment for 5 years—he was emi nently 01 the type which faces towards the sun as represented by the longest purse. He was valuable, fond of wine and good living and kept a large harem. On the whole he was fairly satisfactory. The new Karguzar Muazid-i-Azam is a man of a more modern tvpe favour- able to Europeans and European ideas but too timid to be successful. He is aiso apt to act rather as an advocate for the Persians than as a judge. He is attempting to put the Karguzari upon a basis of rule and regulation which Is sometimes vexing to those accustomed to the easier regime of bygone days.PERSIAN.

While the expedition did not cover the Persian troops with glory they did establish'the fact that a Persian army was being formed which would in the course of time by superior cohesion be able to deal with Baluch raiders. In June the Officer Commanding troops moved the garrison out to Sar-i- , Asaib 3 miles from Kerman where the recruits were put through a considerable amount of work in physical exercises and drill. The men looked a fine lot physically. They were however without proper rifles and as ammunition is scarce have no opportunity of being trained in the use of their arms. They. remained at Sar-i-Asaib till September and the Officer Commanding built offices and godown for military purposes. It is intended to turn the place into permanent summer quarters for the garrison. In July attempts were made to enlist a camel corps from Narmashir Bam and Jiruft districts but though these attempts were repeated till the end of the year nothing definite had come of them. In August the detachment which had been posted at Jiruft was recalled owing to the severe type of malaria by which they were being rendered useless. Many of the men had to be kept in hospital for a considerable period the officer in charge taking many months to recover. Recruiting continued throughout the year, recruiting parties causing con siderable trouble to the people and at the same time giving a source of income to the officers in charge of the recruiting parties : one officer alone is reported to have made Tumans 2,000 from payments for exemptions. Owing to the alarm caused recruiting was temporarily suspended. . About 700 recruits were enlisted and some 500 men sent to Shiraz. In October Mahmud Khan, Amir-i-Lashkar, the General Officer Command- im* the Southern Army arrived from Ispahan. He was accorded a very con siderable reception, the biggest of any official since the Farman Farma was appointed Governor-General of Kerman many years ago, thus marking the position of the army in Persia. While he inspected the troops and their training, his chief activities were .n connection with Baluchistan affairs and will be noted under that heading. At the beginning of December all the available troops left Kerman for Rudbar under the command of Naib Sarhang Mohamed Khan, the Officer Com manding Kerman, to bring to heel Zargham-es T Saltaneh an important semi- Baluch chieftain of that place. Amir Shaukat who was given the governorship of Jiruft, Isfandiqeh, Jabal Baris and the surrounding districts was placed m political charge of the movement. Said Khan another big robber chief came in and Zargham-us-Saltaneh after retreating to the hills also came in and made terms. The troops at the end of the year were still in Rudbar and a permanent garrison is to be posted there in connection with the proposed move on Bampur next year. Mahmud Khan, Amir-i-Lashkar, is a man of some character but like most upper class Persian is a poor Mohammedan, he is a heavy drinker and led a verv dissolute life at Kerman. He made a considerable amount of money while there, purchased Tumans 1,500 worth of carpets and remitted Tumans 2 000 to Ispahan. He is considered a capable man but there was little oppor tunity of judging his work directly. He is distinctly a man of common sense. Naib Sarhang Mohamed Khan is a young man of about 26, of pleasant manners aud fond of European society. He has made a good deal of money at Kerman over enlistments and his various campaigns. He keeps his men at work and trains them well to the extent- that is possible with the limited means at his command. As already noted he was formerly too friendly with the Soviet Consulate and far too much a supporter of those who were pushing Bolshevism. This attitude has changed. The police are thoroughly unsatisfactory and rarely recover any stolen „ . , property. In the old days when the Governor-General was responsible for the roads and the police he was also called upon to pay for any losses by theft gr robbery. Now the police are responsible and the Governor-General does not pay them or the Amnieh consequently he can hardly be pursued for losses.PERSIAN gulf political residency, 1923. 4l The Eais Nazmieh receives Tumans but 80 per mensem and the post has been the perquisite of the army, . 1 property Nalb ' EalS ^ 1:llmSelf been P rosec »ted for being in possession of stolen His Majesty's Consul has personally had much to Complain of and even when he himself discovered the thief of a diamond ring and other things in his in the (Consulate WaS 6 as tlle thief was I' 146 evidently the Police spy Local Politics.

Mulla Farajullah. For Rafsinjan— Mirza Shahab, ^a Sheikhi and a member of the Socialist party. As a Sheikhi he belongs to the same sect as the Ibrahimi family. The elections for Bam were conducted with great heat. The Governor- Genera^ showed a tendency to back the Bolshevist friend Agha Mehdi until His Majesty's Consul protested to him privately against his supporting a man who had shewn such open anti-Btitish tendencies. Thereupon he changed his support to the Wakili family Amir Ihtisham, a clever opportunist to whom the IbraMmi family had no objection. The extreme democrats however objected to the Governor-General using the same methods at Bam, Sirjan and Jiruft as had resulted in the election of their candidates in Kerman and Rafsinjan and with the powerful support of Sulaiman Mirza the Socialist deputy and member of the new Cabinet they were able to get the elections suspended per manently just as the election boxes with votes for Amir Ihtisham had been collected. An inspector was to be appointed from Tehran who has not yet arrived and in this condition the election still remains. Bam is democratic to a degree which may be called Bolshevistic and it is to be feared that Nazim-ut-Tujjar who was arrested and deported by General Sykes and is now in Tehran will be elected. At Sirjan the conditions were much the same beyond that before the sus pension votes had not been taken. An inspector was appointed in the person of the new Karguzar Moazid-i-Azam but on the complaint of the democrats his appointment was cancelled. The falling cabinet of Mushir-ed-Dauleh was evidently afraid of the Democrats and though refusing to listen to the Moderates' complaints gave way at all times to the requests of the local democrats. These elections are now being completed and it is anticipated that a new candidate Ata-ul-Mulk stated to be the nominee of the Sirdar Sipeh will be elected. U61FD^ ANNUAL EEP&amp;ET OF THE The Jirnft elections had not been opened at the end of the year. The elections for Balnchistan by an absurdity mus^ depend upon the mil of the rebellious Dost MohameeL The leader of the Democrats has been throughout Darghai the Editor of 1 ho anti-British newspaper 4 ^ Nameh Farhang.'' This paper was suppressed and eoptmued suppressed till the end of the year but with the support of Bulaimau Mirza has been republished at the time of writing. At one time His Majesty's Consul had some meetings with this man ex- plaimng to him that the British Government was as democratic as could be OGSired but his natural conceit and ambition made him consider that an extremist attitude would pay him best and on the occasion of the May Day Celebrations at the Russian Consulate he made extreme Bolsheyistic speeches which caused ills Majesty's Consul to cut off all relations with him. The other chief democrats are Agha Mehdi, Intizam-us-Sadat, Rafa'i and trie members of the Bam democrat committee, R ussian A ctivities, iv ?? e activities of the Russian Consulate were great as long as Mirza Ibrahim Khan the Russian Vice-Consul remained in Kerman and later with the ariival of the new Consul. The Governor-General informed His Maiestv's Consul that it was due to his energies that Mirza Ibrahim Khan was removed. M. E vet sky the Consul was a harmless man whose progress in the Persian langnage was small and whose devotion to arrack did not decrease After th« departure of Ibrahim Khan and until his relief by M. Zavlovskv the Russian Mmsniate was hardly heard of. No greater proof of the necessity of a Consul British or Russian, knowing the language could be instanced, ' the P art of the yeaj however great activity was displayed and the V ice-Consul had frequent meetings with workmen and cultivators instigating them not to be content with their present earnings and telling them that if the? made a stand the Soviet Government would help them. Kad ttey been content with this no great objection conld perhaps have been made bnt they openly advocated methods of violence and the Consulate Mirza Hassan Khan Mutabzadeh of the Ibrahimi family, himself a landowner con nected with landowners put up a notice in Bam signed with his name instigating ;he peasants to rise and take revenge on the Sardar Nnsret and Sardar Muialhil revenge not only on their property bnt, on their persona.

In addition the Enssian Consul can^ve support whirls of use at the present time and thus those whom it would ultimately destroy are willing to assist it for the present assistance it affords. On May day a big reception was held at the Consulate. Almost all the local democrats were present and some carpet weavers and cultivators. . J' he EnssiaJi Consul made an Inflammatory speech which was translated by Mirza Ibrahim at great length and in which the Soviet Hymn was given. Among other things the Russian Consul said ' Labourers and cultivators how lung will you slumber. We made a revolution in our country when there was no one to help now we are here to help you. Down with these tyrants unless vou destroy them wholesale you cannot enjoy freedom Dargahi and Intizam-us-Sadat made speeches in reply in revolutionarv sii am.

C ondition of boads. Duzdah Road. —In February the Duzdab-Kerman post was held up near Garageh and a few parcels were taken. At the same time a caravan of tiour was attacked and six donkeys loaded with flour carried away. This was recover ed by troops from Duzdab. In April the road was for a month rendered unsafe for caravans by the Baluch robbers who invaded the Narmashir district. They held up the Bam road near Tahrud until the arrival of reinforcements from Kerman as noted under the Army. Carpets, etc., were temporarily sent by the Bandar Abbas road. A small caravan was carried off near Tahrud including some prisoners. The post came through regularly with practically no molestation no doubt owing to the fact that it is carried and protected by Baluchis or semi-Baluchis. * Khorasan Road. —At the end of January a caravan of Khorasani merchants was looted by robbers towards Khabis. Khabis is one of the happy hunting grounds of the Baluch robbers from Bampur and the Sarhad. In November a band of Ismailzais from the Sarhad again raided a caravan of Sistanis and Khorasanis near Khabis. They killed three men and wounded four, carrying away 110 camels loaded with dates. Bandar Ahhas Road.-—In the first half of March the post from Bandar Abbas was robbed between Pur and Daulatabad where the district of Fars comes down on to the road. In April a robbery took place at Saadatabad near Gakum Tumans 1,500 worth of goods consigned to Khan Sahib Ibrahim Gelladari were carried off. In October Haji Sohrab Khan chief of the Luri tribe was arrested in con nection with a robbery on the road 8 months before. Tumans 2,000 were re covered from him and paid to various claimants. In November a caravan of piece goods and sugar was attacked near Daulatabad and 4 loads and 3 donkeys were carried away. Baluch raids.—In February gangs of Baluch robbers carried away a number of sheep from the Sabughi and Palangi tribes in the Narmashir district. In April a party of 200 Baluch robbers raided Narmashir carrying, away large quantities of loot as noted under the Army. They were under the leader ship of Wali Mohamed Khan Shirdil Narmashiri. In May they attacked a caravan wounding a man and carrying away his wife. In the same month it was reported that small parties still continued to carry away all they could lay their hands upon. They stripped the agent of the Deputy Governor of Bam and took his rifle. The outlying roads of the Bam districts were practically closed to traffic and people hardly 'ventured from one village to another. In October Baluch raids were again reported from Narmashir. In the middle of November a party of Baluchis attacked near Tahrud a caravan loaded with ghi and dates. Ali Shah Khan Baluch of Sipi -Nusretabad in charge of the Amnieh recovered the stolen property. At the end of the year a very considerable raid, made by Yar Mohamcdzais from the Sarhad and other Baluchis under Wall Mohamed Khan bhirdil Sarmashiri occurred. Reports of numbers vary upto 900 men but it may be taken that some 500 men in two parties of about 250 each took part, iney looted the whole country stripping, Narmashir and Jabal Bariz. It is estimateapeesiak' gulf political residency, 1923. 45 that they carried away Tumans 200,000 worth of loot in camels sheep and grain while, an unusual thing in such raids, they destroyed what they could not carry away. The raid was beleived by the Government officials to be intended to draw the troops away from the expedition against Zargham-us-Saltaneh but the destruction of supplies and the carrying away of all campls would look as though Dost Mohamed were intending to make the assembly of an army in Bam and Narmashir difficult. Baluchistan affairs. —Dost Mohamed the de facto ruler of Baluchistan which province has for some 17 years been out of the control of the Persian Government has with his myrmidons for some time been giving trouble on the Mekran frontier. , In April he accused British officials of having warned him that the Persian Goyernment was about to attempt to assume control and of having said thev would assist him to resist by supplying him with money, arms and ammuniUon, a wilful perversion of the truth. In October His Majesty's Government were considering the advisability of having a special consular officer for Persian Baluchistan and His Majesty's Consul met His Majesty's Consul for Seistan at Quetta where frontier matters were discussed with the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchis tan including the subject of the expedition which the Persian Government propose to send to Bampur next year. For the present the Persians have decided to occupy Khwash, Bam and Rudbar on the Baluchistan frontier the latter two being already held by the. end of the year. The visit of the Amir Lashkar was mainly in connection witlr this expedition and after visiting Bam and studying the question he returned, to Ispahan. In the meantime Diwan Begi former Governor of Bam has proceed ed to Bampur with a Yawar of the Army and is discussing with Dost Mohamed the question of his submission. Should he prove recalcitrant columns frdm Kerman and Duzdab will in conjunction march against him. Amnieh. —The Amnieh requires to be considerably improved before it can be considered to be in a satisfactory condition. It has been posted upon the roads to Duzdab, Bandar Abbas and Yezd as follows :— The Amnieh to Duzdab though only 35 in number keep the road fairly safe, at any rate as far as British interests are concerned, since they are Baluchis. The fact that in the Sarhad we have been subsidizing the chiefs of the robber tribes may also have something to do with the fact that the post is practically never molested. ^ On the road to Bandar Abbas there are apparently no men at Daulatabad or in Fars at Pur Ahmedi, the two points at which generally speaking caravans are attacked. It is interesting that 19 years ago His Majesty's Consul put up a scheme for the protection of the road much on the line now adopted but laying stress on the necessity of garrisons at the points named. Condition of Country. —-Excellent rain fell during the winter and spring continuing to the end of May. Floods occurred in the early part of February causing very great damage in the country both around Kerman, Rafsinjan and Sirj an. The damage to ' kanats ' was very great amounting to several hundred thousand tumans. A part of the poorer quarter of Kerman town was destroyed some 30,000 tomans worth of damage being done. A sum of 940 Tumans was subscribed in Tehran and Kerman for the sufferers and the Russian Consulate gave Tumans 540 which was distributed through Dargahi. A very severe earthquake occurred on September 22nd at 1 a .m v in the morning. The centre of the earthquake was at the foot of the Lalehzar moun tain 60 miles from Kerman. In Googher village 80 people were killed at the first shock. The total casualties amounted to aboilt 300 to 400. There were no casualties in Kerman town but many houges were damaged. Trade. —The trade that the town of Kerman and much of the district live upon is the export of carpets and it is well to emphasize this fact by placing it first before dealing with the question in general or in detail. LcGlFDANNUAL EEPOET OF THB The following was the total of value of carpet exported To America ,, ,, To England ,, ,, To Torento .. To France .. .. ., To Switzerland .. . , 1 To Canada .. To Sydpey Total Krans 7152599-30. The general question of Trade in Kerman has been pressed repeatedly from Tehran. It is difficult however to see how our 'trade with the Kerman province can at present be improved. The main articles of import are piece goods, sugar, tea and Kerosine oil, the balance consisting of necessities such as metals for vessels, cooking and otherwise, manufactured articles such as lamps hinges. More than 90 per cent, of the piece goods are imported by the Hindus from Manchester and India all being actually despatched some direct from England by the order of the Hindis' offices in Bombay and Karachi. Tea is necessarily from India or China, but Indian tea from Calcutta is practically the only import. Sugar is imported from India but as India itself imports from Java the main part of it is Java made. Kerosine oil comes in the main from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Works. Glass china lamps and hardware are imported from Bombay and are mostly Foreign made. His Majesty's Consul has just given a free ticket to Karachi to a large importer of such articles and ha^ informed him that if he wishes this concession to be repeated he must see that he purchases material made in the British Empire. In a free trade country with' purchase in the cheapest market it is not likely that he will find much in the way of British glass or. crockery. His Majesty's Consul can see only one way to determine that British goods are purchased and that is to have a paid British Trade Agent on small pay who will be in a position to receive orders on samples from British companies, receiv ing the ordering commission on sales. To present favouritism he should act under the eye and inspection of the Consul. This plan has however not been found acceptable by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, as savouring of Bolshe vistic methods as associating the Governmont with the. Trade. This may be so but the plan is the best one and personally His Majesty's Consul can see no objec tion to the Government being associated with the Trade of its country to keep such trade as exists from being encroached on by the Russians. ^ t Kerman is a poor district lives entirely in its agriculture and its carpet and shawl trade. The people are poor and haye no margin for the purchase of luxuries. With reference to the opening of new trade until the country is developed His Majesty 's Consul can only echo the opinion of Major Lorimer in 1913 when he said in his Trade Report ' in the present condition of the country it would be cynical to call on foreign compierciaf pjiterprise to direct its attention further to Kerman.'' The country may shortly be developed and therefore Consuls must keep their eyes open for such future development when they are actually likely to be possible but for general import at the present minute in the words of the Report on the Commercial Mission to South lEaster# Persia for 1905. Exports consist of barpets, guns and pistachio nuts. The exports of carpets is mainly in the hands of foreign tirms, 50 per cent, of the total manu facture of the fine carpet known as the Kerman carpet being in the hands of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Lipited of London, with its main office at Smyrna. The other firms in order of importance are :— American-Armenian-— Messrs. H. S. Tavshanjian. Messrs. Costikyan. Krans. 6296195-50 418362-05 240139-40 100359-40 53622 -56 34708-25 9212-20PERSIAN GTJLF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1923. 47 Messrs. A. M. Karagheusian. Messrs. B. Kazanjian. Messrs. S. Telfyan, all represented in Kerman by Armenians. The Swiss Firm of— Messrs. A. E. Wetli has now joined up for purpose of carpet export with Messrs. Whitmann of New York. It is now represented by the Head of the firm Mr. A. E. Wetli. Persian exporters of carpets are few, the chief being Messrs. Dilmaghani and Company, who have been acting with Messrs. Wetli. Messrs. Kazwini and Company, who purchase for an American firm in New York. Exports to the United Kingdom consist mainly of Tribal carpets. The Kerman carpet has been ruined by designs imported from America carpets which are washed in acids in America to give them a silky glow and are then clipped for sale. The acids ruin the durability. The export of gums notably tragacynth has not been successful though the present low prices ruling may make export a better proposition. The Kerman Tragacynth is inferior in quality and quantity to the Hamadan Kermanshah product. Pistachio nuts were exported mainly from Sirjan and Eafsinjan and are a paying crop but trees take 8 to 10 years to give results and some 20 to 30 years to come to full maturity. Banking and Influence of Trade on Banking. —The Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia States that the diminution in the import trade resulted in a weakening in the competition for the increased supply of exchange accruing from the growing export of carpets and Bunking profits benefitted proportionately. The demand for financial accommodation was unabated but in view of the general trade depression it was necessary to exercise considerable caution. There was steady trade increase between Kerman and Yezd on account of Henna. The second six months brought a demand for bills on Meshed as a result of the demand for tribal rugs from that place. It is understood that these were to h* exported to Constantinople. The market for shawls, which mainly go to Tehran and Tabriz, was quiet and consequently exchange on Tehran was not so plentiful as usual. . Exchange on Bandar Abbas depends upon spring and autumn imports and in the winter upon exports of cotton and pistachio nuts from Rafsinjan. The market for gum tragacynth fell off. Excellent rains last season produced improved grain crops and plentiful herbage so that the cost of living fell considerably reacting on the landlords wno were compelled to restrict their patronage of the import in luxury trade. Trade while dull and lifeless has resulted in no failures during the year. The exchange during the year varied from Krans 303 to 358 per 100 Rs. BRITISH INTERESTS. 1. Political. In general it may be said that there has been little change fwJ P 0Sltl(&gt;11 dese fbed last year. The British, no longer the arbiters of . e 0± governors have still been looked upon as having considerable infiu- wA n 111 Te . ll . ra ? 1 ' and 1 . t ! ie task of His Majesty's Consul has not been to attempt to take part m the political and other struggles which have taken place but to keep out of them. His influence had he experted it would still have been powerful enough to influence the elections of at least three of the six members of ^ a W tQ t 1 he ^ 0 l vernor - Gene ral regarding the latter's support to be withdram^ 0 Were ope ^ ly ^ olslievisti£ was sufficient to cause that support frai i ex P os 3^ on of ^e Government policy has caused Persian officials to 1 J e flos ^ llt y which they showed at the beginning of the vear—a 7 v.

In attemping to understand this the Persian credulity the Persian desire to believe an exciting story must be understood. An example which has just occurred will make this clear. A well known friend of the British came to the Consulate to state that the Persian papers wrote that according to Moscow wireless hostilities had broken out in Afghanistan and the truth was being concealed to pre vent the Persians joining in the hostilities. It was evident that he half believed the story. He was asked if he had ever even during the war heard of anything in. Reuters ou the British telegrams which were false. He admitted this to be a fact. He was then asked whether he had ever heard of a false statement issued from the British Consulate. He replied he knew that such a thing had not occurred. In answer to a further question he admitted that Moscow news was frequently false. He was then asked why since the British Consulate had stated there was no war he considered the matter further. He replied that the Persians we're a credulous nation and it was no doubt owing to their desire to believe sensational news that the Russians were able to deceive them again and again. His Majesty's Consul passed by the fact of his considering the fact of Britain wishing to avoid Persia entering the war. A further story will illustrate the position of the officials. The new Bais-i- Malieh, the Karguzar and on6 or two other officials who were distinctly friendly to the British desired to start a club asking the British Consul to assist. Later the Rais-i-Malieh stated privately that they had had to give up the idea since they were told that they would not be well reviewed as being pro-British. The person who told them was -undoubtedly the Governor-General who had no desire of seeing his officials in daily meeting with the British officials and the British colony. Similarly the new Rais-i-Post was afraid to take a lift on a snowing day to his house in the Consul's car for fear that democrats should accuse him of pro-British tendencies. The fear was over sensitive and ridiculous but is quoted to show conditions. Yet over stress must not be laid upon this condition its influence must not be over exaggerated, it frequently merely brews caution and nothing more. The abstention of the Consulate from the elections and from supporting this man or that for governorship has unquestionably had a very great effect in showing that we have no axe to grind but this should not prevent us using the amount of unofficial assistance or remonstration which must it is imagined be used even in civilised countries between themselves. There was in Persia in general considerable unrest and demonstration over the expulsion of the Mujtahid Mohamed-el-Khalasi from Iraq. In Kerman owing to the action of the Governor-General little activity was shown, while since the leading divines were on good relations with this Consulate they were only too glad to have an excuse .to take no action. The Tehran newspapers drew attention to the fact that in Kerman alone there was no demonstration and said that tho priests apparently considered it a religious duty to please the British officials.

J- Biggs in January. The girl school in under the charge of Miss M. J. Stewart and the children Welfare and Midwifery under Miss Stratton assisted by a trained Armenian nurse. « • Bishop Linton of Ispahan inspected the Mission in the month of May and baptised 15 converts. The conversion of these men one of whom a boy from the mission school was the son of a well-known official, caused a considerable stir among the Mullas. The Governor-General spoke to His Majesty's Consul on the subject pointing out that such conversions were against the terms under which the mission was allowed to remain in Persia. The excitement died down sooner than rhight have been anticipated. The conversions were mainly due to the activity of a Miss Aidin a half Armenian and a young lady of considerable personality. As she left the place it was not anticipated that the question would arise again for some time out the matter Avas referred to His Majesty's Minister who stated that we undoubtedly could not approve of any active proselytizing. • 4 Consular Proceedings. The Karguzari work was fairly satisfactory though Mujallal-us-Saltaneh did very little during the time before his departure. The total cases settled, by the Karguzar in conjunction with the Consulate in which the interests of British protected and Foreign subjects were concerned was 38, and compensation recovered amounted to Krans 47,974-70.- 52 cases were pending at the Karguzari at the close of the year. There were two cases against British protected or Foreign subjects.. No criminal cases were disposed of. (Sd.) L. B. H. HAWORTH, His Majesty's Consul Kerman.

Persian Baluchistan. —In July rumours were current that Sirdar Dost Mohamed Khan was collecting a force at Bampur with the intention of raiding British Mekran but later it appeared that his intention was to reduce independ ent chiefs and to instal Sirdar Husain Khan of Gaih as paramount chi^f. He came to Mekran in November, defeated Mir Hoti of Lashar and occupied Fanuch. It was reported that Dost Mohamed extorted six thousand Tomans from Mir Hoti. The chiefs of Bint agreed to recognise Husain Khan as their supreme chief and to pay one-third share of the revenue to him. Dost Mohamed returned to Bampur immediately the Bint chiefs agreed to his proposals. Claims. Some of the old claims made by the British Indian subjects against tlie chiefs and the people of the Persian Baluchistan were settled during the year.

Since Islam Khan's death there has been a dispute about thfs d^vi won and Husam Khan has all along disputed Nagdi Khan's claims but was not aWeto do anything iii tlie matter until this year when with the help of his father- in-law, Sjrdar Dost Mohamed he was able to get a portion of his share.

Tliey all seemed very inendly and offered assistance. Nagdi Khan complained of' receiving no subsidy and the grievance he was labouring under was that though head of the whole district, the British Government did not recognise him as siich. 1 assured him that if his statement was correct the matter would be represented and arranged accordingly but he must at special request hand me over the men who were responsible for firing into our camp at Surag and also the man responsible tor cutting the line between Sadaich-Surag section. He agreed and ordered Mir Ayuo Khan and Mohamed Ali Khan, to proceed to the ^ene of interruption i rom reliable authorities I understand that the culprits are a gang headed bv son of Haji Hoti and relatives. It has also been stated- that a blood feud exists between the relatives of Haji Hoti and the sons of Islam Khan. Nagdi Khan and Ayub Khan offered to kill the man for cutting the line but I did not approve df this. The petty subsidised headmen of Eapch district also called to receive a present and their half-yearly subsidy. As tliey have given us absolutely no assistance during the year, I refused to interview them, have given them no presents and have already recommended by wire to have their subsidies |ield. Mohamed Ali Khan has been paid a present of Rs. 75 for assisting in restor ing communication. I am of opinion that the only way to solve the problem in me present unsatisfactory political situation in the Karwan district is to officiallv recognise Nagdi Khan as the stronger chief and pay him a subsidy. The Gov - ermnent will not Be put to any extra expenditure because I can recommend that UOTD54 aknital. eepoet of the ■ the subsidies paid to the following petty useless headmen be reduced and some of them to cease entirely. The following headmen received subsidies as follows ;—• For the whole year— Mir Yahya Khan Mir Alae Mir Hassan Bek Mir Shahsowar Mir Esau Sherkhan Mir Gool Mohamed Mir Abdoo Total Rs. Rs. . 500 . 200 . 200 . 50 . 50 . 50 . 50 . 1,100 Now proposed— Mir Ayub Khan in place of Mir Yahya Khan Mir Alae... Mir Hassan Bek • Total Rs. In hand Rs. 450 100 100 650 450 This amount of Rs. 450 be paid to Nagdi Khan yearly, with an agreement that if the line tampered with again the subsidy will also cease. I think if this could be arranged, matters will undoubtedly improve in the Karwan district. The Dasht of the Gaih District. From Balband to Tez Hills is still administered by Sirdar Husain Khan. As stated before the Bandini district is also under Husain Khan at present. On his recent tour through Rapch, Bandini and Bir he spoke to me twice on the phone. He expressed his loyal feeling towards the British Government. He also complained and commented about the 1 Char bar customs share and said that Sirdar Din Mohamed won because our Government was more in Din Mohamed's favour and was assisting and protecting him. When asked to assist and punish culprits who damaged the line in the recent interruptions he replied that the matter should be referred to the chiefs who receive the subsidy for that district. Most of his replies in conversation were verv childish. Now that he is guided by two able Wazirs of Dost Mohamed Khan matters may improve. I was anxious to have a personal interview with him but owing to shortage of rations he could not wait until our arrival at Bir. The petty headmen, i.e., Mir Khair Mohamed and Mir Shah Beg, with Mullah Shahdullah called. The latter is the brother of Azim Khan who was killed at Gharbar through a misunderstanding. They all seemed friendly and loval to the Government. Shahdullah is still worrying about a subsidy and has managed to get a letter of recommendation from Sirdar Husain Khan which I am enclosing herewith. In my opinion he seems a level headed man, respect able and looks honest. His brother Azim Khan seems to have rendered Gov ernment good service. I think if the subsidies of other headmen from Bandini to Oharbar could be reduced and out of the balance a subsidy arranged for Shahdullah, it would be advisable as I think he is a man who will come of good use some dav. Hot Lai Mohamed of Khir is in my opinion useless and not deserving of^Rs. 100 a year for doing nothing at all. Through his district I must admit that the line has not been tampered with but this is not on account of him The people are much more friendly and peaceful. He has been dealing in the slave trade and also has extorted some live-stock and instigated one oi his relatives to steal 8 coils of wire and tools from the lineguard. ^This was reported to me on the 26th instant. On hearing of our approach he has abscondedpeesian gulp political residency, 1923. 55 lywards Nagwar. If his subsidy could be held for a while and reduced to half j think he will then come to his proper bearings. The other half I strongly iccommend that Shahdullah should receive. Hot Nezar Mohamed of Sirgan, whose subsidy was transferred to Hot Lashkari in consequence of a letter which Mulla Moosa, Munshi to the Charbar Telegraph Office prepared and eventually proved to be unauthorised and Mulla Moosa lost his appointment over it, called and said that he received the subsidy for the half year ending 30th June of the current year. He said that the amount was paid to him through Hot Gool Mohamed who saw me yesterday. Since Nezar Mohamed's subsidy ceased through Mulla Moosa's mischief, I think he should now be recognised as the Sirgan head-man and the usual subsidy paid to him as before and not to Hot Lashkari who is a, brother of Hot Gool Mohamed of Parag and has nothing to do with Sirgan. Gaih District. This district is managed by Sirdar Husain Khan as before. With the help of Sirdar Dost Mohamed Khan, Husain Khan has become much stronger and with the guidance of two able Wazirs of Dost Mohamed Khan matters may improve. Dashtyari District. Sirdars Din Mohamed and Mahmud Khan are joint chiefs of the district. This administration seems to be quite satisfactory. Din Mohamed is still the stronger chief. Both of them appear to be loyal to the British Government, It is mmoured that Din Mohamed and Dost Mohamed Khan are contemplating arranging a meeting at Lashar where they wish to settle about the Charbar customs allowance and make peace between Husain Khan and Din Mohamed. Bahu District. Mirs Subhan and Ahmed Khan are still in charge of the district and are managing it quite satisfactorily. They are quiet and un-interfering and treat their subjects well. General. There has been no satisfactory rain-fall. In October the Jask district had some and a little fell at Rapch. Famine conditions are still prevailing. The arms and slave traffic have decreased. • The feeling towards the British is satisfactory with most of the chiefs and people of the country except the Karwan lot. They are very wild and I am afraid it will take a long time before they become reconciled. During the year there was a fight between some frontier tribesmen and men of the Levy Corps stationed at Suntsar. I understand that 12 tribesmen were killed. Annual Administration Report of the Ahwaz Consulate 1923. Personnel. —Mr. E. G. B. Peel continued to hold the post of Consul and Captain E. H. Gastrell the post of Vice-Consul throughout the year, Mr, Eahmatullah Khan returned from long leave on SQth March 1923 an* I resumed his post of Head Clerk, Sheikh of Mo hammer ah. —His Excellency has had an anxious year. Tie has watched the gradual collapse of the Bakhtiari Khans with mixed feelings, unable on the one hand to conceal his satisfaction at the arrival of this somc^ what tardy nemesis but alarmed at the same time at the crumbling of the barrier interposed for so long between himself and the forces of the Central Government, When he learnt of the intended movement of the Persian troops to Arabistan he made Ahwaz his headquarters and has never left it since except for very brief visits to Mohammerah or Basrah. He felt that the presence of troops in Northern Arabistan would provide a rallyinc: point for all the ele ments hostile to himself and that local disturbances would be fomented by the50 ANNUAL HIPORT Olr THE troops in order to saddle him with the responsibility and provide them with an excuse for mterfermg with his territories. It was only after Sir Percy Lorame s visit to Ahwaz.m October .when he brought with him a letter of assurance from Sirdar Sipah with regard to the Sheikh that the latter defmitelv decided^ to throw m h-is lot with the War Minister, but to enable him to do- this without reserve he was insistent that a meeting between Sirdar Sipak and himself should be arranged without delay. Unfortunately Sirdar Sipah lias not yet been able to spare the time for a visit to Arabistan although he has expressed himself as most anxious to meet the Sheikh. During the visit of His Britannic Majesty's Consul to Tehran in the summer an eltort was made to reach an understanding on the subject of the Sheikh's revenue but the American Financial Adviser refused to commit himself It was finally arranged that Colonel MacCormack, Director of Internal Revenues should visit Arabistan and discuss the question with the Sheikh in person' The -Colonel reached Ahwaz in the middle of November and after a week's hard work succeeded in effecting a settlement the terms of which were as follows ; The Sheikh to pay 500,000 Tomans on account of arrears of revenue,, Tomans 300,000 being paid in cash and the balance in instalments spread over 20 years The future Direct and Indirect Eevenues to be consolidated at Tomans 150,odd annually, from which a deduction of 20,000 Tomans was allowed to cover'the Sheikh's pension and other legitimate charges. It was agreed that the Indirect. Eevenues of Arabistan should continue to be collected by ipe Sheikh's agents, and not by the officers of. the Persian Revenue Department. In spite of the settlement of this long standing dispute Between Hi^ Excellency and the Central Government there are still plenty of rocks ahead.. The Central Government is determined to assert its authority throughout Ara bistan or rather Khuzistan, as it is to be known in future and it is not to be supposed that the Sheikh and his Arab tribesman will watch this process with, folded hands. Bakhtiari. —The family feuds of the Bakhtiari Khans which had broken- out afresh after the Shalil incident of July 1922, were .skilfully exploited by the' Central Government and by the first week in February Amir Mufakbam and Sirdar Zaffar found themselves compelled to resign the office of Illkhani and Illbegi. All the leading Khans with the exception of Murteza Quli Khan and Sirdar Fateh gradually assembled in Tehran and a homeric struggle ensued between themselves and the Minister of War as to the amount of compensation to be paid by the Khans for the losses inflicted on Persian regular troops at ShaliL The odds were heavily against the Khans. Their position as virtual hostages at the capital, the despatch of 250 troops from Isfahan to Chahar Mahall, ostensibly to capture some notorious robbers but actually to show the Khans' that their homes were at the mercy of the Persian Government, and finally theif own inte-rminable bickerings all Combined to weaken their bargaining power and it was only by the strenuous efforts of His Britannic Majesty's Minister that the compensation was eventually fixed at the comparatively moderate sum of 150,000 Tomans. No sooner however was this crisis safely passed than fresh pressure was brougiit to bear on the Bakhtiari Khans in the shape of a demand by the en 1 Financial Adviser for arrears of revenue amounting to- Tomans one million five hundred thousand, of which it was demanded that Tomans one hundred thousand should be paid in cash and the remainder in instalments spread over a term of years. This demand was of course excessive but the Khans made little or no effort to prepare their case and when two months had elapsed without any reply being vouchsafed their private estates outside Tehran and Chahar Mahall and Arabistan wore suddenly seized by officials of the Persian Revenue Department supported by Military force. This drastic if somewhat arbitrary action brought the Khans to their senses. After protracted haggling amongst themselves and threatening to throw themselves on the mercy of the Shah and so forth they eventually wrote to Dr. Millspaugh nominatinjr two of their number. Sirdar Jan^ and Amir Jang, to represent the whole body of Khans in any discussions which might take place. Numerous conf^on^es foUowed and the American Adviser finallv agreed to accept Tomans 500,000 excluding the rpvpmie of Aomli. Tomans 50,000 were to be paid at once and the balance in instalments of 30,000 Tomans a year.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDE IT CY, 1923. 57 In the jneantime Sirdar Sipah had been encouraging the separatist ten dencies ot the Oliahar Lang sections of the Bakhtiari tribes by allowing them to nommate their own tiibai governors and by placing them directly under the control of the Governor General of Isfahan. This was a severe blow to the prestige of the Illkhani and Jilbegi of -Bakhtiari. Those appointments had been bestowed on Sirdar Mohtasham and Amir Jang at the end of May but at the end of August they informed Sirdar Sipah that they could not continue to hold office unless the Chahar Lang tribes were again placed under their control It was therefore arranged that Amir Jang should meet the Ohahar Lang Chiefs in Isfahan and endeavour to reach a settlement through the mediation of the (rovernor GeneraL The attempt was unsuccessful and the complete separation of the Northern Chahar Lang Section (the Mahmoud Salihi) gradually became an accepted fact. ^ The status of the Southern section (the Kuinarsi tribes of Janeki) still remained doubtful at the close of the year. Laying claim to the whole of Southern Bakhtiari including the Malamir plain and the Oilfields area the Janeki Khans could, if freed from the control of the Bakhtiari Governors and supported by the Central Government, make the position of the Bakhtiari Illkhani and Illbegi intolerable. The authority of the latter in the south would be completely undermined and only a representative of the Persian Government supported by troops could then hope to keep the peace among the mutually hostile tribal units to the North and North-East of the Oilfields. No doubt this is what the Central Government is trying to bring about but in the meantime the position is ono of great difficulty for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Urgent representations made by His Britannic Majesty's Minister to Sirdar Sipah both before and after the former's visit to Arabfstan in October have elicited from Sirdar Sipah little beyond a declaration that the operations of the Conmanv will not be allowed to suffer bv any alteration in the status quo. Dizful and 57ms7?iar—There have been radical changes in this district since the last annual report was w r ritten. The Vice-Consul at Dizful transferred his headquarters to Shushtar in March, the Shushtar Consular Agency 'being abolishoi as from March 31st. The Vice-Consulate itself was abolished in December 1923, the post having remained vacant since the previous May. In proposing the transfer of the British representative from Dizful to Shushtar and his subsequent withdrawal from Shushtar also Mr. Peel wrote as follows in January 1923 ;— ' So long as the Central Government in Tehran remained impotent the interposition of the neutral zone of Dizful and Shushtar between the territories of the Bakhtiari Khans and the Sheikh of Mohammerah served to minimise causes oi inction between the rival chiefs with beneficial results to Arabistan generally. A forward policy oh the part of the Persian Gov- ernfnent naturally draws these parties together with a view to protecting their common interests and renders the position of any British represen tative one of extraordinary difficulty in attempting to reconcile the oppos ing views of the Persian Government's representative .and the powerful chiefs whose territories lie to the north and south.. The position is rendered still more difficult by the fact that our Consular representative at Dizful was until a year and a half ago the ck facto Governor of that district. In view of the present political situation in Persia I have.no doubt that the wiser course is to eliminate the British representative at Dizful and allow the three opposing forces in Northern Arabistan namely the Persian Gov- ernment, the Bakhtiari Khans and the Sheikh of Mohammorah to work out their proper equilibrium without aid or hindrance from us British Political interests in the Dizful area are in the nature of a 4 damnosa haereditas ' and no time should be lost whether on political or economic grounds in closing down the Dizful Vice-Consulate.' The event has fully justified this decision. His Excellency Mushar-ud- Bowleh who had lived on the bwt of terms with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, His Britannic Majesty's Consul and the local people resigned in October and shortly afterwards the long advertised Arabistan detachment consisting of 250 Persian troops under command of Colonel Baqir Khan marched into Shushtar and occupied the Government buildings which had just been vacated by the retiring Governor-General. Moayyed-ed-Dauleh (not the individual of the same name who herld the post in 1922) arrived in November as Governor General but is little Tnoro than a cypher, all real power being concentrated in the hands of Colonel Baqir Khan. The behaviour of the troops has been excellent and the Le6lFD «58 ANNUAL KEPOET OF TH© inhabitants of Dizful and Slmshtar appear to have adapted themselves to the new regime without serious ditiicuity. Anglo-Persian Oil Company. —The Fields Manager writes as follows : ' Production—The demand for crude oil has been greater than ever with the result mat me tlirougnput nas been increased auriiig the year, and the boosting stauons, wnicn couid naraiy nave copied wiin tne increased quantity before the recent expansions and improvements were completed have be6n equal to all demands made upon tnem. Accommodation. —The following additional buildings have been com pleted during the year , 40 Bungalows. 120 Clerks' quarters. . 144 Artizans' quarters. Thus conditions in the way of accommodation have been much improved. In addition new workshops and stores buildings at Eaiihead have been con structed and are now in commission. T v Company.'s Ahwaz offices nave been transferred to Khazaliyeh which is about a mile from the town of Naseri, and the whole of the staff are now domiciled in the. same area. Obvious advantages accrue from this centralization in a district some distance removed from the native quarters and the bazaar. Primarily more healthy conditions obtain and the control of sanitation is much more easily effosted. Secondly, accommodation is better and not so limited, and at the same time it is far more convenient for the Company's employees to be housed nearer the scene of their labours. Labour. —The Company continues its policy of replacing Indian labour as far as possible by local labour. All unskilled labour and, an increasing amount of skilled labour is at present performed by the natives of the country. The system of training Artkans in our own workshops continues to give-' fairly satisfactory results. An average number of 224 apprentices^ have been undergoing training at the same time during the present year, but latterly (i.e., during the last quarter of the year) the number has in^ creased to close on 300. About 10 per mouth are successful in passing the trade test and are then put on Grade I terms of Artizans. As their expe rience increases opportunities are afforded them for passing higher tests and thereby improving their grade. Transport. —A 2 , -—B'' Gauge Light Railway was completed during May of last year running from Dar-i-Khazineh to Maidan-i-Naftun, and has im- • proved considerably the transport facilities in the area. The length of the line is 38^ miles and the average tonnage carried per month stands at about 2,000. This reduces to a negligible quantity tlie goods for transport by motor and animal vehicles on this section of the road.' . Foreign Interests.-—The French Archceological Mission continued its opera tions at Shush from January to March 1923. During tho last weeks of their stay the members of the Mission fohncl themselves sandwiched between the- Arab forces of the Sheikh of Mohamnierah and some rebel tribesmen of the Amleh Lurs and for a few days were virtually prisoners m their chateau which had been selected as an asylum by the rebel chief tain. A Russian Consular Agent nailed M. Batmanoff reached Ahwaz on the 23rd November. He knows no language but Russian and is consequently un approachable except through his interpreter Mirza Ibrahim Nami of Tabnz who is an ardent Socialist and speaks Russian, French and German fluently.-Fonnal calls were exchanged between the Consular Agent and His Britannic Majesty s Consul but so far no other' intercourse has taken place. Tjimrh Road —The average rate of mule hire from Ahwaz to Isfahan was . «W-'f»s The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation forwarded onlv 2031 Cwt. m 19^, compared with 3271! Cwt. in 1922, and 51254 Cwt. in 1921. No robberies of British goods were reported on this road during the year. (Sd.) E. 0. B.

The General Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, put up i proposal to His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq, suggesting that He Company's Security Department at Abadan be authorised to issue ' ihatt- 01-Arab ' visas to all W fide employees of the Company and independent British Tiaders at Abadan subject to the general supervision of the Vice- Consulate at Mohammerah The proposal was formally accepted by the ' Iraq Government m August statements of visas granted, issues made and the fees are forwarded to the Vice-Consulate on the 1st of each month. ^ Considerable rouble and inconvenience was experienced by Persian subjects, during the month of September on account of the Kargu^ar refusing to issue Passports for Basrah and journeys to 'Iraq. Several Persians appealed to this Vice-Cosulate, and representations were made, but the Karguzar stated that ne was acting under instructions received from his Government at Tehran. A Library called the '/ Khazalieh Kara-at-Khana ' was opened in February and a club called the Persian Union Club, was started in June. The Prime mover was a Persian named Ayat Zada. It soon became know that Mohammerah news was being reported to Tehran. So a month later, the Sheikh ordered the closing down of both and Ayat Zada and another Persian were instructed to leave Mohammerah, failing which they would be punished. Tj 113 Annual Reception in honour of His Majesty the King Emperor's Birthday was held on 2nd June.

Customs. —Monsieur Cordonnier was Director of Customs during the year and the Department worked - satisfactorily. An order was received from the General of Imperial Customs, Tehran to dispense with the services oi all Foreigners in the Customs Administration. As a result of this the services of four of the senior employees were dispensed with, without the pay ment of any compensation for long and faithful services rendered.

Consular Escort. —Two local Persians are maintained as guards, during the day and the Sheikh arranges for Ghulams at night guards. • ^ '^British Interests. —The lAjiglo-persian Oil Company, Limited, informed this Vice-Consulate, that, with effect from 1st January, Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited, ceased to be Managing Agents of the Anglo-Persian Qil Company, Limited, Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, having gone into Volun tary Liquidation. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, made considerable progress with extensions, and new installations and Tanks were erected during the year. The European staff has been double and there is a slight increase in the Labour employed, which now totals 10,577. Over a thousand 'Iraqi employees have been replaced by Persians. During the period 1st January to 8th December 310 Tankers were loaded with 2,725,586 tons of Oil. The Pipe line capacity and pumping stations have been increased. The Company's distributing organisation in 'Iraq and Persia have been developed. Two serious Epidemics of Plague and Cholera occurred which sightly impeded the progress of work and interfered with the routine of the Refinery, during the year. There were approximately 500 deaths from Plague and 1,000 deaths from Cholera. Great credit is due to the Medical and Sanitary Officials by whose strenuous efforts the Epidemics were got in hand. 'Security Department. —Early in the year a Department was formed consist ing of Ex-South Persia Rifles men, in order to keep order and^protect the Com pany's property. Later in the year this Department became known as the Security Department in charge of a European Security Assistant. It is the intention of the Company to completely abolish farrashes and increase the figure of Security Guards to 250. The Security Assistant has also been invested by Government with, the Powers of a third Class Magistrate. At Mohammerah the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Head Office, has con tinued its work. / Several n^w houses have been built for the staff. Roads have been built and several Motor cars are in use. There is a motor car service between Moham merah and Abadan ; Mohammerah and Basrah and MohammeraJi to Ahwaz. The Imperial Bank of Persia. —This Bank carried on its work during the year, Mr. W. N. Cuthbert was manager throughout the year. Owing to the increase of work it was found necessary to appoint a second European Assistant during the year. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited. —Mr. J. Marshall was Deputy Manager of this firm until February when he was relieved by Mr. C. Black who continues in the appointment. Quarantine and Health. —Assistant Surgeon C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., held the appointment of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. The Charit able Dispensary in the town continued to be well attended. A severe outbreak of Cholera and Plague occurred at Abadan and Moham- merah, during the year. The Basrah Authorities took necessary precautions by placing a Police Cordon to stop all road and river traffic between Basrah and Mohammerah ; only Oil Barges and Tugs and sea-going vessels were allowed to enter that Port flying Quarantine flag, when they were inspected by the Port Health Authori ties. The same precautionary measures were adopted between Mohammerah and Abadan, and Mohammerah and Ahwaz. No passengers were allowed to proceed without first obtaining Emergency permits from the Quarantine Authorities at the different ports. There was practically no communication between the three places during the month of August. (Sd.) C. H. LINCOLN, Acting H, B. M.'s Vice-Consul, Mohammerah.PEESIAN GULF POLITICAJL.

Gazdar, M.B.E., held the post of Superintendent and Treasury Officer from 12th March till the end of the year. Sub-Assistant Surgeon U. K. Vakharia remained in charge of the hospital throughout the year. Foreign Represevitation. —The French and American Vice-Consulates re mained closed throughout the year. His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent remained in charge of French and American interests. Ruling Family. —His Highness the Sultan, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, C.S.I., was in residence at Muscat from beginning of the year till 11th April when he left for Dhofar in H. M. S. Triad. He remained there till the end of the year. Saiyid Said eldest son of His Highness and Heir Apparent of Muscat State who joined the Mayo College at Ajmere in 1922 continued to be well reported on by the College Authorities. Accompanied by his tutor Khan Bahadur Siddiq Hasan he paid short visits to Muscat dtiring the Summer and winter vacations. The Council of M misters .—The composition of the Council of Ministers remained the same as last year. It functions with delatoriness and during the absence of His Highness to Dhofar found a new excuse for procrastinatiou by reserving decisions on important matters pending his return. Saiyid Nadir the President when remonstrated with averred that it was impossible for the Council to arrive at a unanimous decision as the second me'mber, the member for Finance, invariably opposed any suggestion he made and the third member, the Minister of Religion, was too old to do any work. The fourth member, the Minister of Justice, not being an Arab is treated.by the other three as a nonentity, hut has to be tolerated by them as he is the only one who can read or write. The Council cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory but is possibly the best vehicle of Government for the time being. Finances. —Captain E. D. McCarthy, I.A., was appointed by His Highness to be Financial Adviser to £he Muscat Government from 1st January in addition to his duties as Commandant of the Muscat Infantry. He was transferred to India in February and was succeeded by Lieutenant R. G. Alban, Indian Army who remained in charge till the end of the year. In spite of the efforts of the Financial Adviser it appeared as the year were on that it would only be a matter of time before the State went bankrupt unless Customs dues were raised or new sources of revenue found. The causes of the inability of the revenue to meet the expenditure are briefly decline in trade, higher cost of administration and in some cases pecula tion by officials. The last two have received the serious attention of the Financial Adviser and much progress has been made in economy and purification of the administration. The decline in trade is a very different matter and appears almost inevitable in its occurrence. Of course it must be remembered that the State now pays for its own pro tection in the form of a local Corps whereas formerly an Indian regiment main tained by the Government of India was stationed at Beit-el-Falaj. In order to meet the deficiency in revenue, temporarily at any rate, various new minor taxes have been instituted, and a change in the method of collecting the date revenue (Zakat). is contemplated but it is feared no real financial security can he felt until the Customs duties, which, after all, are the main sources of revenue, are increased. The Financial Adviser is very active in the reform of the Customs Adminstration and has made several tours to the outlying Cus toms Houses but it seems fairly clear that until a suitable sea-going vessel is nrocured by the State adequate supervision is a matter of extreme difficulty. Negotiations are being opened for the purchase of a steam tug capable of putting to sea in almost any weather and it is hoped that this will solve the64 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE In the Autumn Abu Saleh the Indian Director-General of Customs was found unsatisfactory and dismissed being replaced by Mr. Sikander an Egyptian. Tribes of the flultancite. —The attitude of the Beni Bu Ali remained un changed. Although they were not actively hostile to the Muscat Government, they lost no chance of pursuing their claim to independence and continued writing letters to the Agency on the subject. Their contentions were not treated seriously and it is hoped that in time they will settle down. The A1 Saad after the lesson they received in 1922 remained peaceful and gave n!o trouble during the year. Tribal disputes resulting in murders occurred between the Bani Jawabir and the Bani Wahaib at Ruwi and Wataiyah and threatened to develop into regular feuds. The Muscat Government were fortunately in a position to take strong action and put an end to the trouble by imprisoning the leaders of both sides. During the early part of the year Sur was in a state of disturbance for some time, several tribal murders having, occurred among the Aramah and Mokhanna tribes and smuggling was on the increase. In June Sheikh Rashid, Minister of Religious Affairs, accompained by Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness, visited Sur amd endeavoured to settle the tribal disputes but their efforts were in vain. In July Mr. Zuber one of the Ministers of the Council accompanied by Captain Alban, Financial Adviser and 150 men of the Muscat Infantry with machine guns left for Sur. They occupied the fort of Sanaisla and the tribal leaders were summoned. The dispute settled by the blood money being paid and the arrears of Customs duty, viz., $6,400 being surrendered on the spot. The tribes were also fined $4,-000 for their misbehaviour. Affairs in Oman. —Mohomed bin Abdullah al Khalili continued in the position of Imam. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh remained as the Chief of the tribesmen. In July Sheikh Khalfan bin Sanaiyan, Sheikh of Nakhal was treacherously murdered and the Imam was alleged to have been concerned in it. The affair looked like producing serious complications in Oman but the situation was saved by the timely arrival at Nakhal of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh who was able to teffect a settlement. Army Traffic. —No purchases of arms or ammunition were made from the Arms Warehouse during the year. Slave Trade. —16 slaves took refuge at this Agency of whom 14 were manu mitted ; on investigation one was found to be a freeman and the case of the other is doubtful. British Subjects and British Interests. —193 'British Subjects and 314 British Protected persons were registered during the year. Trade is almost entirely in the hands of the British Indian subjects. The price of dollars varied according to the fluctuation of the silver market and local demand. The aver January March May July September November Total Imports for the vear ending 31st March 1923 amounted to Rs. 66,40,500 and Exports to Rs. 27,69,900 as compared with Rs. 70,94,670 ^nd Rs. 20,85,285 respectively the previous year.

E. EAE, Majtr, Political A gent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muscat I*61FD -66 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Administration Report on the Trucial Coast for the year 1923. The year 1923 was a fortunate one in the Trucial Oman in having no history : there is practically nothing to record. Khan Sahib Isa bin Abdul Latif was Eesidency Agent throughout the year. The traffic in Baluchis kept up in a desultory way. Experience shows that qw Tr-nA* in y ears of ^ad harvest in Mekran the Baluchis and Mekranis sell their children and relations of limited intelligence to Arabs from the opposite Coast. We have also found that Mekranis as a whole are partial to the trade. Cases have occurred in which female Baluch slaves after being manumitted and repatriated have returned to their Arab masters finding home life in Mekran too hard. Other cases have come to notice of men selling children, getting them released and manumitted and again selling them some months later. It is difficult to contend with this trade when the victims (?) of it seem more in favour of it than otherwise. The Eesidency Agent has done his duty in the matter well, having been very active in tracing and recovering newly enslaved Baluchis and Mekranis, and ha's incurred a good deal of odium thereby. \ The only event of any importance was the revolt of the Headman of Haira, Abdur Rahman bin Mohamed, against the Shaikh of Shargah in July 1923. After some difficulty a peace was patched up between Shaikh Khalid and Ikfe Abdur Kahman but the latter was banished to Ras-el-Khaima. A certain amount of work in mining oxide done at Abu Musa by Messrs. Strick's representative on the Island under the supervision of the Company's Agent at Bandar Abbas, but so far no oxide has been shipped to Europe. The only affair of any importance wds the long outstanding case of the Ras pi Khaima murder at Ras-el-Khaima of a Somali sailor which took place about four years ago. The Somalis claimed blood money which the Shaikh of Ras-el-Khaima refused to recover causing much ill feeling thereby, and it seemed probable that they would take reprisals on Ras-el-Khaima men going to the Red Sea. For a long time the Shaikh refused to pay the blood money. But after a great deal of pressure and some threats he was persuaded to pay it in the interests of his travelling subjects. Shaikh Abdulla bin Rashid, who had succeeded his father Shaikh Rashid Umm-ul -Kawain. P 111 ^ a f ew weeks before, was murdered # ? . • on m t in Q c toher by a slave at the instigation or Ins cousin Shaikh Hamad bin Ibrahim, who succeeded him ^ according to plan . The latter for some time was not very firm in the saddle but was re ported to have made matters up with his rival cousin and uncle towards the end of the year.

No doubt the Shaikh, A j man _ wll o is excessively turbulent by nature, received a lesson in 1921. The normal delays to ships owing to the shortage of boats passed all bounds Debai. during the year. Repeated letters to the •»*- i j , . . Shaikh had no effect. Shaikh Saeed bin Maktoom being quite incompetent.

TREVOR, Lielt.-Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. E. I M. a 14 LAWRENCE IBth March 1924. Confidential. Administration Report of the Bahrain Political Agency for the year 1923. ' 1, Personnel. —Charge of the Political Agency was held throiighout the year by Major C. K. Daly, who was also in charge of the duties of the Indian Assistant which post retained vacant. 2. The Ruler of Bahrain and Al Khalifeh family. —After the effect of the warning given by the Honourable the Political # Resident to the Ruler in March 1922, (see Administration report for that year) had worn off, Al Khalifeh family had endeavoured to stifle agitation among their Shiah subjects, by a return to mthless oppression. This policy was continued in the early part of 1923. No single clause in the undertaking, given by Shaik Easa to his subjects in 1922^ was acted up to, and efforts of Shaik Hamad bin Easa to ameliorate the situa tion were frustrated by other members of the family who followed the policy of the Ruler, as dictated to him by his wife. Members of Al Khalifeh family continued to rule over their individual spheres, wherein they had unfetered powers, in spite of the Ruler's previous undertaking that Shaik Hamad should alone have powers of punishment. Oppression was in fact assisted by a mock court which had been set up, and was presided over, by Shaik Selman bin Hamad, a tyranical youth, who has definitely thrown in his lot against his father, and is bitterly opposed to all idea of reform in the administration. Junior members of the family, who felt any diffidence in yielding their autocratic powers, and feared restraint from Shaik Hamad, took disputes between them and their Shia subjects to this court, where the most flagrantly unjust decisions were given. Armed with such decisions, with which they could appeal to Shaik Easa, Shaik Hamad was powerless to oppose them without.incurring the com bined opposition of the senior members of his family. Much oppression continued to take the form of compulsory leasing of date gardens belonging to the Shaiklings, to the Shia farmers, at rates which could not possibly be remunerative to the latter and the terms of which they inevitably failed to fulfill, whereupon they were subjected to various forms of punishment. The more powerful Shaikhs were in the habit of. letting whole estates, contain- ing many gardens, to one Shia, who would be appointed ' Wazir ' over the locality. This individual would in turn sublet the gardens to his own advantage. In- asmuch as he had the ear of the Shaik and the official position of Wazir, such officials were responsible for a great amount of oppression. A number of cases of confiscation of the property of Shias occurred on The flimsiest pretexts. Practically all the gardens now owned by Al Khalifeh family have been so acquired during Shaik Easa's rule, from the original owners. Probably two thirds of the total date gardens are now owned by Al Khalifeh, very few of which have been legally obtained. Every effort was made by reactionary members of the ruling family to stir up religious hatred between the Sunni tribes and the Shias. The Sunnl tribes and pearling Nakhudas, hitherto enjoying absolute immrmjtv from control oy the Rulers, resented the agitation of the Shias, which they foresaw might eventually lead to reforms inimical to their interests. The Government of India, in consultation with His Majesty's Government, had for some time had under consideration the desirability of introducing some6S annttal report op the reforms into the administration. It was felt that misrule having reached such a pitch, our failure (as protecting power) to correct abuses, might be unfavour ably commented upon in neighbouring Shia countries. In the meantime the Sunni tribes, together with most of the ruling family, had determined to make desperate efforts to coerce the Shias into submis sion. An armed, and entirely unprovoked attack took place upon the Shi a village of Barbar, carried out by the Dowasir tribe. Several persons were wounded, property was looted, and women molested. The Ruler made no attempt to obtain redress for the injured, and leaders of the Shia community who appealed to him were threatened with further re prisals should agitation continue. Outrages on Shias, continued in the out lying villages, for which nobody was punished or arrested. Religious hatred, always most acute in Bahrain, not unnaturally became intensified. The Persian community sympathised with their co-religionists the Baharaneh, while the Najdi community were bitterly opposed to them. In May, riots occurred in the T^wn of Manameh between Najdis and Persians, resulting in several deaths and many wounded. It was established that the riots were, without doubt, premeditated- and instigated by one Abdulla A1 Qosaibi who was acting temporarHy (in the absence of his brother Abdul Aziz Qosaibi) as the Agent in Bahrain of the Sultan' of Nejd. There were strong grounds for supposing that he would not have dared to adopt such a line without being assured of, at least, the tacit approval of the Sultan. ft was firmly believed by Shaik Easa and others that, in view of Abdulla&gt; Qosaibi's position as the Sultan's agent, no action would be taken against him. Had this, in fact, been the case, the door would have been opened to Najdis to combine with the Sunnis to coerce Shias and to interfere, in innumertble ways,, in the internal affairs of Bahrain.. Such action would have the approval of the Sultan of Najd, ostensibly on religious grounds, inasmuch as it would assist his co-religionists, but in reality, in furtherance of what has manifestly become his policy in regard to Arab states in the Gulf r namely to gradually reduce them to a state of subser- vince to Najd by interference in their internal affairs. Qatar has become, for all practical purposes, a province of Najd, by such means and signs have not been lacking of a smilar policy at Oman and elsewhere. During the disturbances in Manameh, the Dowasir tribe again took the law into their hands, and in pursuance of the- policy advocated by Shaik Easa and his wife, carried out an unprovoked attack on the village-of AIL The attack took place by day with flags flying, and not attempt at concealment. Several persons were killed, the village looted and women raped. The situation was not devoid of serious possibilities, it being impossible to guage to what extent Najd support might be forthcoming for the Dowasir, who had let it be known, that they had been promised assistance. Shaik Hamad, who had at his disposal no more than a handful of ill-armed fidaWis, themselves Najdis, was obviously unable to take any steps to control the situation. On May 17th the Honourable the Political Resident arrived in .the mail, and His Majesty 's Ships ' Thiad ' and ' Crocus ' also reached Bahrain. ^ Pro tracted negotiations took place with the Ruler, Shaik Easa bin 'Ali. In view of the Shaik's advanced age, and manifest inability to rule, lit alone deal with the difficulties inseparable from the introduction of reforms. His Majesty's Govern ment desired that Shaik Easa should hand over full powers^ including control of the Revenue, to his heir-apparent, Shaik Hamad bin Easa, retaining, as a matter of courtesy, the little of ruber. Shaik Easa as had been his custom 1'or years past, proved quite intractable and resolutely refused advice tendered' him both by the Resident and his own sons. He was finally informed that Government had no recourse, in the interests of his country, and the peace of the islands, but to transfer the active conduct of affairs together with control of the Revenues, to Shaik Hamad. Shaik Easa accepted the situation with an ill grace; and has never ceased to associate himself with all who are opposed to Shaik Hamad, and to en courage discontented members of the family and the Sunni Headmen, in any form of agitation, or attempts to coerce the Shias to assist him, which action he fondly imagines, may force Government to once more place the conduct ot affairs in his hands, a contingency which is manifestly impossible, but which Shaik Easa, and still more, his wife, are incapable of realising to be the case.PERSIAN' GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1923. 69 gliaik Hamad sent for,' and detained for a few days, the leader of the Powa .sir, Ahmad bin Abdulla. He was required to produce certain people of jns village who it was believed had been wounded, during the attack on 'Ali, To do so, would have proved their participation, or at least made it difficult to explain their wounds. He excused himself on various pretexts. In spite of the evidence of hundreds of witnesses, including the wounded persons, the Dowasir protested that they had no knowledge of the whole affair. Such also was the intensity of religious feeling that scarcely a Sunni could be found who .ciid not stoutly deny that the .Dowasir could possibly commit such a crime. The nephew of Khan Sahib Yusuf Kanoo, C.I.E., M.B.E., K.I.H., who owns motor cars for hire by the public, declined on his uncle's advice, to hire his cars to the headmen of 'Ali to enable them to bring wounded Shia women and others to hospital. Under such circumstances it was impossible to hope for justice from any tribunal composed of Sunnis only, and a mixed tribunal would have taken opposite views, and merely intensified the existant ill-feeling. Any attempt to determine the responsibility for the crime by means of a ' Majlis '—the oqnivaleiit of an Indian Frontier * Jirga ' would have been abortive. Shaik Hamad accordingly inflicted a fine on Ahmad bin Abdulla, for failure to control jiis followers. The money was paid by subscriptions by the Sunnis, and was devoted to payment of compensation to the wounded and heirs of the killfed. The punishment was of course inadequate, and shortly afterwards a well Imown Shiah Alim and his companion were murdered on a road near the Dowasir village of Budaiyeh, under circumstances which clearly pointed to the murder, bning an act of revenge by the Dowasir, the victim having given evidence against them in the previous case. The fact that the Buler failed to take any action in this case still further encouraged those opposed to his rule, particularly the Sunni Nakhudas, who apart from their dislike of reforms calculated to make them amenable to law on a common footing with Shias, were apprehensive that the reforms would ineludfe some check on the serious abuses which have crept into the diving trade, from which they derive their fortunes. They are wealthy and conse quently influential. Encouraged by Shaik Easa, and Shaik Abdulla and other members of A1 Khalifeh, who resented the curtailment of their powers, and assisted by some Egyptian and Persian agitators, they embarked on a calumni- ons press campaign, ostensibly aimed at what was termed ' British Interfer ence ' but in reality with the object of wrecking the reforms, and causing the overthrow of Shaik Hamad and a reversion to the rule of Shaik Easa, under whom they could expect absolute license. In October, one Abdul Wahab Zayaini ( a member of a family, all of whom have derived their fortunes from pearling) whom in spite of the fact that he and his family had in the past enjoyed complete immunity from taxation, had continually intrigued against the Ruler, commenced holding secret meetings and endeavoured to obtain signatures to a petition to the Resident. Some ten persons signed such a petition, couched in unbecoming terms, complaining of the interference of the British, objecting to the initiation of reforms, and demanding the return of the rulership to Shaik Easa. Funds were collected for a press campaign and an Egyptian agitator, notorious in the Grulf, was sent to Bin Saud and to the Ruler of Qatar to enlist their sympathies. The Honourable the Political Resident visited Bahrain on November 1st. Shaik Hamad requested him, in writing, to remove from his dominions Abdul Wahab and another, and Ahmad bin Abdulla A1 Dosari, who were stirring up his subjects against him and creating ill feeling. TFe Government of India, in view of the Shaik's request sanctioned their deportation. Meanwhile, how ever, the headman of the Dowasir, Ahmad bin Abdulla, had presumably guessed the Shaik's intentions, or was nervous as a result of the murder of the Alim, referred to above. He therefore had decided to leave, together with any of his tribe whom lie could influence, for the mainland, ostensibly because he could not brook the new regime. His departure was arranged to synchronise with the presentation pf the petition by Abdul Wahab, and the Nakhudas had great hopes that such action would terrify Shaik Hamad and cause him to resign (determied effiorts to frighten and cajole him into resignation were made) or force the hand of Government to replace Shaik Easa. LeGlFD70 ASTtftfAL EEPOfcT 01' THE Ag a matter of fact, it has always been customary for the Dowasir headmeix to visit the mainland at that season of the year, for a few months, and they doubtless had it in mind to return if the scheme failed. As however, otlier Nakhudas threatened to take the same action, and it was considered by the -Ruler highly undesirable that the Dowasir should have a footing' both in the Najd and Bahrain camps, which would enable them, under the protection of the Sultan, to raid Bahrain, or continue to commit outrages and flee to their fellows on the mainland, the Resident authorised Shaik Hamad (and assured him of support) to inform the Dowasir that they must, within a specified time limit, elect either all to return and submit to Shaik Hamad's rule, or all to depart to the main land. In the latter case they must expect their possessions in Bahrain to be confiscated by the Ruler's Government. The remaining Dowasir made serious efforts to induce Ahmad bin Abdulla and his party to return, but the latter undoubtedly fearing that he would be brought to book for the murder of the Alim, about which details were beginning to become known, and having in he meantime been offered some inducements to settle on the mainland, by Bin Saud, declined to come back. Before the expiry of the time limit, the remainder accord ingly left and joined him at Dhamman, on the Hassa coast, about midway between Bahrain and Qatif. The Dgwasir have always been the backbone of the resistance of the Sunni tribes to Shaik Easa's rule, and the most oppressive and tyrannical of the tribes, both in their dealings* with their ^aharaneh date-garden farmers, and their divers in the pearling boats. TJie Ruler has never been able to control them, and has never collected revenue from them. Their departure from Bahrain has assisted Shaik Hamad to assert his authority more than would ever have been possible had they remained, engaged in constant intrigue with the Sultan of Najd. Trade.-—Th-Q trade of the Islands greatly improved during the year under review. The pearl market was exceptionally good. Monsieur Ruben visited Bahrain together with a Monsieur Raebin and bought a considerable stock of pearls. Mr. Pack, representing Rosenthals also came and bought petrls valued at between fifty and sixty lakhs of rupees. Several local merchants visited Paris during the year, to dispose of their pearls. It is notable that no purchasers for the British market seem to be forthcoming. The trade seems almost entirely confined to Jewish firms in Paris. Imports from all sources for the year amounted to £2,454,571 and Exports to £860,589. About two-thirds of the imports tre transhipped at Manameh for the mainland, and do not figure under 4 exports Shipping.—No foreign ships visited the port of Manameh during the year. His Majesty's ships paid the following visits— B. I. M. S. Nearchus .. .. .. Three. H. M. S. Crocus .. .. . • Four. H. M. S. Cyclamen .. .. .. Six. B. I. M. S. Nearchus .. .. , .. Three. R. I. M. S. Lawrence .. .. • • Five. Judicial.— hundred and eighteen civil suits and one hundred and ninety-one criminal cases were disposed of during the year in the Court of His Majesty's Political Agent. The Court was not closed during the hot, season as the Political Agent did not proceed to India on the annual recess. The Court was closed during the month of Ramadhan. Since the conduct of affairs was transferred to Shaik Hamad bin Easa, he has insisted on pearling Nakhudas'bringing their accounts to his court, whence disputes have been referred to the Chief Qadhi, who has disposed ot them m a satisfactory manner. The appalling usury which such cases have disclosec calls urs-ently for remedy. Cases have occurred in which the Nakhuda claimed as much a^ Rs. 2,000 from the diver, whereas after proper inspection ot the accounts in the Qadhi's court, it has been found that considerable sum was actually due to the diver, from the Nakhuda. A typical set ot divmg accounts, which the Political Agent had an opportunity to examine (by reason of the tact th^t the particular Nakhuda happened to be a British subject and could be com: pelled to produce his accounts in court) disclosed that all the divers were apparently heavily in debt to the Nakhuda. The debts were of such a natmePEBSIAN GULF POLITICAL EESIBENCY^ 1923, 71 that it would be impossible for the divers ever to pay tliem off, so that in accordance with divmg tradition thvy would be compelled to continue to dive annually for the Nakhuda. It was found that it the diver could succeed in repay ing the debt, he would, actually have received, on the average, five or six rupees per mensem, for each actual month of diving. Even it the debt were not re covered from him, the amount, on the average would not exceed Rs. 30 per men sem. A cooly in Manameh earns, on the average, Rs. 45 per mensem. A diver's work is extremely hard and fraught with danger. The system as at present worked amounts therefore, for all practical purposes, to enslavement, from which divers have been unable in the. past to obtain any redress from the powerful and united class of Nakhudas. MunicipaUty. —The Municipality of Manameh lias continued to do excellent work and the Town can claim to be the most sanitary in the Gulf, Shaik Hamad is desirous of introducing a water supply and Electric powers, which Shaik: Easa had for so long opposed. It only remains to discover a suit- , able and reliable to carry out the work. Customs. —At the request of Shaik Hamad an officer was deputed by the Government of India to oversaul the State Customs Department. Mr. G. N. Bower of the Imperial Customs Service was detailed for this duty. The customs receipts have been improved to the extent of Rs. 1,000 per diem, without increase of duty, due solely to efficient supervision. The landing wharf which was built some years ago but never completed, is now being finished. Suitable sheds are on order, for erection on the wharf for the protection of merchandise. Mer chants have been in the habit of petitioning Shaik Easa for this for many years past. Inasmuch, as the customs receipts are .the main Revenue of the State merchants have every right to expect reasonable protection for their goods while in the customs premises, A light railway line is about to be laid from wharf to sheds, which will considerably reduce handling charges, now abnormally high.

The hot season was unusually mild owing to the prevalence of a ' Shimal ' or North wind. Autumn rains were above the average. The Sultan of Najd. —Local relations with the Sultan of Najd have been somewhat strained. Firstly on account of the necessity of deporting his Agent Abdulla Qosaibi, as above described, which he resented, and secondly, owing to the Sultan's policy of gradual interference in Bahrain affairs, which manifested itself in the shape of encouragement to disaffected Sunni tribes, such as the Dowasir and the reception and ostentatious entertainment of, discontented members of A1 Khalifeh. The introduction of reforms aimed at affording to the Shiah inhabitants some relief from ruthless oppression, is peculiarly distasteful to the Sultan of Najd, who holding as he must (at any rate before his Ahkwan subjects) the extreme views of the Wahabites, regards all Shiahs a/ unworthy of any consideration. He has in Qatif and Hassa, a large number ui Shiah subjects. These were originally inhabitants of Bahrain, who before the capture of Hassa by Bin Sand, had crossed over there, preferring Turkish rule to'oppres- sion by A1 Khalifeh. They are closely related to the Shiahs of Bahrain and many of them own property in the Islands, or shares in such property, under Muhammedan succession Laws. Bin Saud is doubtless apprehensive lest the movement for better conditions which has been so active in Bahrain, sliould spread to his own Shiah subjects, whom he has during the past year, taxed to the utmost limit. The Sultan has hot displayed any friendliness towards Shaik Hamad bin Easa, -whose policy of co-operation, and endeavours to reform conditions in his country, he regards as a retrograde step. This is not unnatural, the Sultan being the most autocratical Ruler in Arabia.72 aitjrual eeport of the « The Ruler of Qatar. —The Shaik of Qatar maintains the friendliest relations with Sjtiaik Hamad bin Easa, He has steadfastiyrefused to assist members of A1 Khalifeh who are opposed to the new regime. In his own territories the Shaik is now powerless. Any attempt to enforce his rule is frustrated by malcontents appealing to the Sultan of Najd, whose power the Shaik fears. Cases have occurred of persons being arrested by armed followers sent by the Sultan, not merely within Qatar territory, but actually in the Town of Doha, where the Euler resides. That he bitterly resents such inter ference is clear from repeated attempts made by him to gain some promise of support from Government. Persian pretentions to Bahrain—The campaign in the Persian press re ferred to in the Administration' Report for 1922 has continued spasmodically throughout the year. The Persian Government issued instructions to its officials in Gulf Ports to treat Bahrainis as Persian subjects, and the Persian Consul at Najaf issued a notice to the effect that Bahrainis should register them selves at the Consulate as Persian subjects. , Such action can hardly be regarded as serious, nor can the Persian Government hope for any tangible results from it, but it is probably an inexpensive means of pleasing public opinion in Persia, and of advertising the solicitude of the Government for Persian interests abroad. The few Persians resident in Bahrain who are responsible for anti-British propaganda in the Persian press, are persons of no standing, who engage in this pastime apparently out of aj desire for notoriety.

K my ait F boktiers*, ^'oTsOth April the Shaikh was informed that His Majesty's GoverBmeut TSOOgnized the frontier with 'Iraq which he claimed.PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL EE SIDE IT CX, 1923. 73 The frontier line of Kuwait is therefore as follows :—starting from the southern portion of Ras-al-Qulai'ah (42 miles from Kuwait), with the town of Kuwait as centre, it describes an are towards the west until it intersects 29° Latitude, and from this point runs in a straight line to the Batin, opposite the junction of the Wadi-al Aujah with the Batin. The line then runs northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan ; then eastwards, passing just south of Jabal San am, Safwan and Umm Qasr, and so on to the junction of the Khaur-az-Zaubair with the Khaur 'Abdullah. The territory en closed within the above line and the Persian Gulf, together with the islands of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah, 'Auhah, Kubbar and Umm-al-Maradin, is recognized as belonging to Kuwait. The tract of country bounded on the north by the southern portion of the Kuwait frontier as described above, on the east by the sea, on the west by the Shaqq, and on the south by a straight line running due east from the Shaqq, through 'Ain-al-Abd to the sea north of Ras-al-Mish'ab, is recognized as common to the two States of Najd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy equal rights. C ondition op the C ountky, Trade with Najd remained closed throughout the year^ Beyond a few raids of minor importance, there were no incidents of interest in or affecting the desert territory of Kuwait. A very marked tendency was noticeable amongst Najd tribes to take refuge in 'Iraq from the exaction of Ibn Sa'ud and at the close of the year Kuwait Conference was being watched with intense interest, to see wheher 'Iraq would agree to Ibn Sa'ud's demand that such refugee tribes should be compelled to return. 1 A ems T eafpic- i Two consignments of arms and ammunition, apparently smuggled from Kuwait and destined for Dubai, were captured and confiscated by the Customs Authorities at Lingah in March. The first consisted of fourteen rifles and the second of twelve. In July the Shaikh of Kuwait confiscated a consignment of twenty-three rifles which were being smuggled from the town by land. A few days later he received a letter from Yusuf-al-Mansur, saying that the rifles were for him and asking him to release them. The Shaikh replied that, as he had absolutely pro hibited the export of arms except on licence, lie regretted that he was unable to comply with his request unless asked officially to do so by Government. He added sarcastically that no doubt a true friend of Government like Yusuf-al-Mansur would have no difficulty in arranging this. Yusuf-al-Mansur wrote again that he was, as Shaikh Ahmad said, a true friend of Government, and again asked him to return the rifles, fyit the Shaikh categorically refused. N ajd C ustoms. The question of the re-opening of trade between Kuwait and Najd, and to collection of Najd customs in Kuwait had been discussed at the 'Uquair Conference in December 1922. Subsequently, on a visit to Kuwait, His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq had talked the matter over with Shaikh Ahmad and persuaded him to agree to receive a visit from a Customs expert on behalf of the Sultan of Najd tq frame a friendly Agreement, in com munication with his own experts, to be concluded between the two parties. Ibn Sa'ud had been informed of this. A long delay ensued, however, in which Ibn Sa'ud said he was'awaiting an invitation from Shaikh Ahmad to send a representative, and it was not till the 16th April that his representative actually arrived in Kuwait, in the person of Saiyid Hamzah-al-Ghauth (a native bf Madinah, who had passed through Kuwait with letters from Ibn Rashid in September 1920). From the first, the Najd envoy took the line that there were only two ways in which a Customs Agreement was possible : either that the Sultan of Najd should keep a Customs official in Kuwait to look after his interests, or that the Shaikh of Kuwait should p^y him a fixed sum annually. Lu6lFD _74 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE . Samd Hanjzah-al-Ghauth was extremely tactless in the attitude he adopted m Kuwait. He spoke of Shaikh Ahmed as having begged Ibu Sa'ud to smrt an envoy—which was not only untrue, but seemed to serve no useful purpose— and also talked a great deal about Ibn Sa'ud's rights,' which naturally annoved the people of Kuwait. On the other hand Shaikh Ahmad wias far from tactful and showed from the first that he had little hope of any Agreement being arrived j it i * 011 ? - vi t'i l. i a er a ^ ew da y s . ( ' ie accommodation which he allotted to Saiyid Hamzah on his arrival was certainly not in Keepinc with bis position as representative of a friendly Buler. ' After considerable pressure, the Shaikh produced a schedule showinK the land imports and exports (less rice which was not shown) for the vear 1 A TT (7th .October 1918-24th September 1919), which he chose as being after the Blockade and before the quarrel between Shaikh Saliin and Ibn Sa'ud It showed the duty charged per bale, bag, etc., in some cases considerably below 4 per cent., and, at the rate of exchange for dollars then existing the total receipts amounted to only Es. 1,16,000. He subsequently agreed to these figures which Saiyid Hamzah said he could not accept &gt;as correct, being checked with the actual books by Saiyid Hamzah and the Political Agent, but the books were difficult to follow and little could be learnt from them. The negotiations proved entirely abortive, and Saiyid Hamzah-al-G-hauth left Kuwait for Riyadh on the 19th May. He was, however, accompanied bv Shaikh 'Abdullah-as-Salim as representative of Shaikh Ahmad, who had appa rently written to Ibn Sa'ud that he saw no chance of coming to an agreement on the terms proposed by Saiyid Hamzah-al-Ghauth, so he had decided to let him return and send a deputation of his own headed by his cousin Shaikh Abdullah. Shaikh 'Abdullah-as-Salim returned to Kuwait on the 27th June and it soon became know that he had come to a private understanding with Ibn Sa'ud, by which the latter was to recognize him as his agent in Kuwait, with whom alone he would correspond, and was to allow trade between Kuwait and Najd to be re-opened in return for the whole of the Customs dues on exports from Kuwait by land, other than those destined for the Shaikh's own subjects or for 'Iraq, which Shaikh 'Abdullah was to collect and remit to him. Shaikh 'Abdullah at first urged Shaikh Ahmed t^ settle the matter himself without consulting his people at all, as,'he said, it was nothing to do with them. The Shaikh, however would not agree to this, and eventually it was decided that Shaikh 'Abdullah should come to the Shaikh's audience chamber, and tell the people himself what had passed between him and Ibn Sa'ud, and Shaikh Ahmad would then see what they advised. On the evening of the 30h June a meeting was held at which Shaikh Ahmad, Shaikh 'Abdullah-as-Salim, Shaikh Jabir-as-Subah, and five of the leading notables were present. Shaikh 'Abdullah first described his journey and Ibn Sa'ud's presents, and then dwelt on the vital importance of accepting his terms. He said that as soon as they did so, he, as his agent, would send Ibn Sa'ud's men out,to tell the tribes that they could come in to Kuwait for trade. At first no one spoke tben Shamlan-ai-'Ali, one of the leading pearl merchants, said that friend ship with Ibn Sa'ud was most desirable, but they were not going to have trade with Najd re-opened at the expense of their own Shaikh's Customs dues. .They then all demanded that another meeting should be called for the following day, at which the rest of the notables of the town should be present. The Shaikh agreed to this, and he and Shaikh Jabir-as-Subah left the palace. Shaikh 'Abdullah- as-Salim then addressed them again and urged them to agree to Ibn Sa'ud's terms. Shaikh Yusuf bin 'Isa, schoolmaster and intriguer, then took up the tale and said that they would never have rest until they accepted Shaikh 'Abdullah and gave him their full support. On the 1st July a meeting of twenty-one of the notables—without the Shaikh or any of his family-—was held in the house of one of the leading townsmen named Hamad-al-Khalid, and the matter was discussed again. Yusuf bin 'Isa addressed the assembly and said that they would never have any rest until they agreed to these terms and got trade re-opened : the only thing to do was to fix the export duty at Re. 1 a bag in the case of rice and 4 per cent, for everything else in accordance with the old Kuwait custom, and to acknowledge Shaikh 'Abdullah- as-Salin-as-Ibn Sa'uds agent with, a free hand in ail matters relating to the desert jPERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, 1923. 75 proper accounts to be kept, and tlie proceeds of all export duty, except that on goods destined for the Shaikh of Kuwait's own subjects or for 'Iraq, to be remit ted to the Sultan of Najd half-yearly by Shaikh 'Abdullah. When they understood that Shaikh 'Abdullah Salim, and not an outsider, was to be Ibn Sa'ud's agent, the majority agreed and drew up a document embodying these points. Shamlari-al-'Ali, however, objected and said that he did not agree . Hamad -as-Saqar said that it was a matter of foreign policy which concerned the Shaikh alone, and that they had no right to, interfere. One or two others said the same, but.seventeen out of the twenty-one actually signed the document, and Yusuf bin 'Isa at once sent it to Shaikh Ahmad. Shaikh Ahmad was very much distressed at the whole affair, and for some days it was uncertain what action he would take. On the 8th July he sent for Shaikh Jabir-as-Subah, Hamad-al-Khalid, Shamlan -al- 'Ali, Hamad-as-Saqar, Yusuf bin 'Isa, and Ahmad-al-Humaidhi and, when they had assembled, asked them their views. Shaikh Jabir-as-Subah said that he would never agree to the proposal in any shape or form, as he was strongly opposed to letting Ibn Sa'ud get a footing in the town. He could not understand why, after all- the lengthy negotiations on the subject with Government which had taken place, and which Shaikh Ahmad had broken off, he should ever even think of accepting this. He saw no harm in his giving Ibn Sa'ud a fixed sum if he liked, but it would be wiser for him to arrange matters through His Majesty's Government. Hamad-al-Khalid advocated fixing a standard 4 per cent, export duty, and remitting it all to Ibn Sa'ud through Shaikh 'Abdullah who alone should corres pond with him. He suggested that they should try this for a year, and reserve the right of discontinuing it if it did not prove satisfactory. Hamad-as-Saqar said that they could not agree to hand over the Customs to Ibn Sa'ud, but lie thought that the Shaikh might try and satisfy Ibn Sa'ud by giving him a fixed sum of money—not Customs dues—and try to come to an arran. gement with him for trade to be re-opened. Shamlan-al-'AIi said that he thought on the whole it was better for the town that trade should not be opened, as the Ikhwan were nasty people to deal with, and Shaikh Ahmad could not keep them in order. Shaikh Ahmad then asked them to think the matter over for a couple of days when he would see them again. On the 10th July the Shaikh summoned the same people and also Shaikh 'Abdullah. The same opinions were expressed and much acrimonious talk in dulged in, but nothing was decided. Shaikh Ahmad, after vacillating for two days more, finally wrote to Ibn Sa'ud rejecting his terms. He said that he was willing to come to an agreement if Ibn Sa 'ud wished it, but if so, he too had conditions to lay down. On the 20th August Shaikh Ahmad received Ibn Sa'ud's reply ; he merely said that if Shaikh Ahmad would like to put forward his conditions he would consider them. He added however, that he could only agree to an arrangement by which the land export dues were collected by a staff other than the Shaikh's ordinary Customs officials, and that he could not accept less than 7 per cent, on the value of all goods exported from Kuwait to Najd. During a visit to Kuwait in early June the Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Knox, C.S.I., CI.E., Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, had suggested to Shaikh Ahmad that a solution to the difficulty might be found if an experienced Brrtish Customs official were deputed to examine the question and advise as to an arrangement which would be suitable to both parties. At the time the Shaikh agreed that it would be very nice if such an agreement could be arrived at. When, however, this proposal was formally made to him, and to Ibn Sa'ud, in October, neither Ruler evinced the least desire to have'the dispute settled, and so the proposal has been abandoned. Kuwait Customs, KUan Sahib 'Abdul Latif has continued to manage the Shaikh's Customs throughout the year, and the system has worked satisfactorily. In April the Political Agent discussed with the Shaikh the question of the export duty of Ee. 1 per 11 tons levied by his Customs Department on stone and /76 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE sand, large quantities of which were required by the Anglo-Persian Oil Comoanv for building operations at 'Abbadan. The Political Agent reminded the Shaikh of a recent conversation in which the latter had assured His Excellency the Hisrh Commissioner for 'Iraq that he would never think of charging more than 4 ner cent, on anything and asked him if he realized that at existing prices he was charging over 3 /2 per cent, on stone, and considerably more still on sand The feliaikh replied that he had purposely fixed a very high rate of dutv on stone to discourage its export, as there was only a limited quantity, and it was badly required for the town itself.

The history of the provinces of Pars, Khuzistan an'd Kerman and the District of the Grulf Ports during 1924 has been closely connected with the fortunes of Sirdar Sipah, the Persian Prime Minister and Commander in Chief, on account of His Highess' continued policy ©f bringing all distant provinces under his com plete control. At the beginnina: of the year a strong canvassing in all Provinces was being conducted by the military in favour of making Reza Khan the President of a Republic. Thais the population .generally—the priests only excepted—at first received with some benevolence, though not with enthusiasm. In March a temporary sot-back occurred owing probably to the fear that the proposed Republic might regenerate into a Socialistic Soviet after the eventual withdrawal of Beza Khan from public affairs. . When the word Republic was made 1 taboo ' the return of Reza Khan to power was generally welcomed. 8ince then he has not allowed the grass to grow imder his teet. At the close of the year he is virtually Military Dictator of the whole country^ The Muhammerah BeheUinn. —The outstanding event of the year in South Persia has been the rebellion of ^Shaikh Khazal, Sardar Aqdas. This has been well and succinctly, described by Mr. Peel. His Excellency misjudged the extent of Reza Khan's power and believed that the Bakhtiaris would combine with him self and the Lurs to effect the Prime Minister's downfall. In his inmost heart he probably believed that, however offensive hi® attitude might become to the Central Government, His Majesty's Government would not allow his semi- independeaat position to be shaken/ His judgment proveidl wrong—as he was constantly warned that it would be—and his power as a ruler is now broken. He is too old and broken In health ever to recover his former position, while his sons do not seem to possess the right temperament to engender confidence in the mind of the present or even of future Prime Ministers* The conduct of the Military—In other parts of South Persia martial propa ganda, followed by uncertainty as to the future of the Army, coupled with the irregularity of their pay, created a very unsatisfactory situation for several months in the year. Junior officers and the rank and file got badly out of control. In Bushire the Residency had to complain of half a dozen minor outrages com mitted against British Departments or commercial concerns. In Lmgah the S.S. ' Monadnock ' incident and in Bandar Abbas the mobbing of two Hindus were symptomatic of a situation which almost became intolerable. Repeated protects to the Officer Commanding at Bushire eventually produced the desired effect. Since September there has been no unprovoked recrudescence of trouble so far as foreigners have been concerned. The murder of ex-sergeant Cox near Kunar Takhteh in October was a crime of a retaliatory nature. The visit of the American man-of-war ' Trenton ' in August to carry away the remains of Major Imbrie had a salutary effect On the mihtary and the popu lation generally as it brought home to all Persians m the Gult the humiliation which they had incurred through the momentary lapse of their Capital to bar barism. t . Nevertheless we frequently continued to he a r of the oorruptlo 1 i of^ ness ofthfnSita^ soZiSSted upon by Army Headquarters at Tehran, are a sham. . . ^ ^ Civil aov&amp;rmteni-^te powers of all governors Mvfe been much restricted hv the Interf~ ot the nuUtary ^ the result there have heen fewer changes of minor appointments. 4 , The collection of revenue t^o« f tont So«.h Pers^has gone steadily for- ward and many Khans have paid up large ^ ^ ^ Tn Ppr^iflTi Baluchistan unrest continued owing to the intrigues of Sardar Muhammad of^^mpur, Din Muhammad of ' Whom are subsidized by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. I fl390PD . .2 Oil. —Tlie experimental operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Mishnn (' Bikarz area ') and on Kishm Island continued throughout the year. The prospect of these fields—and especially Kishm—giving a satisfactory return is apparently waning. II.—East and Central Arabia. Muscat. —The financial situation of the State of Muscat and Oman has rnarkedlv imoroverl. The mere announcement that Mr. Bower, of the Indian Imperial Customs Department, was coming to. Muscat in December 1924 to over haul the Customs Department and inaugurate reforms seems to have stimulated the collection of duties in a marked degree. It is hoped that the appointment of Captain Thomas, O.B.K., to the Ministry of Finance in April 1925 will still further benefit the State. His Hisrhness the Sultan spent only sixteen weeks at Muscat during the year. It is regrettable that he dislikes his Capital and his official duties so much ; more especially as his most powerful brother, Saiyid Nadir, who presides over the State Council, is unreliable, an intriguer, venal and tyranrical. The Sultan's elder son, Saiyid Said, is a bright boy, who is earning good opinions from every one when he returns home oni vacaton from Ajmer. The State's relations with the tribes of Oman continue to be unsatisfactory. A particularly unfortunate incident occurred in June, when the Bani Battash ambushed a detachment of Muscat Infantry three miles inland of Quryat and drove it back to the coast. For this ill-conceived expedition Saiyid Nadir was solely responsible. Trucial Oman. —The only event of importance has been the deposition in November of the Shaikh of Shargah, Khalid bin Ahmad, by his kinsman Sultan bin Saqar, eldest son of the chief who died in 1914 and son-in-law of Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad, Headman of Haira, who assisted in the coup d'etat. The new Shaikh was born in 1903. He seems at present to look very much to the Residency Agent for advice and guidance. The Shaikh of Dibai T s treatment of his Bunniahs is not sympathetic. He does not welcome the increase in their numbers, which is the natural result of his town being made the steamers' port of call for the ' Pirate Coast '. Nor does he seem to realize the other benefits Dibai receives from being constituted a ii maritime port '. The Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company may still possibly elect to substitute Shargah for Dibai, if Shaikh Said biii Maktum's Cargo-landing arrangements are not improved. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who murdered his brother and predecessor in August 1922, is not giving satisfaction in his treatment of traders' claims. He spends most of his time in petty warfare against the Bedouin living in and about the Baraimi oasis, where the Shaikh's power seems to be diminishing. Qatar. —Shaikh Abdallah bin Jasim bin Thani had an easier time than in 1923. This was due partly to Ibn Saud's pre-occupations elsewhere and partly to the fact that His Majesty's Government had firmly reminded the Sultan of Nejd of his undertaking to leave Qatar alone. Shaikh Khalifa bin Jasim continues to be a thorn in his brother's side. The Chief's relations with this Residency were as cordial as ever. Bahrain. —The year has been one of great progress in the Bahrain Islands. The Budget Estimates for the Arabic year commencing 1st Muharram 1343 (3rd August 1924), which showed an opening balance of Rs. 370,000, anticipate an expenditure of Rs. 1,276,690 and a closing balance of Rs. 246,310. Reforms have been introduced in the Customs Department, to the charge of which an Englishman was appointed in January 1924 ; in the Defence Forces by the creation of a State Levy Corps, commanded by an officer of the Indian Army, and the reorganization of the Police ; and in the Pearling Industry, by the inauguration of a new system of ^ Divers accounts ' T . The Municipality of Manama have much improved the- condition of the town, widening thorough fares and constructing a masonry sea-front. At the commencement of the year, in the absence of Shaikh Hamad on his annual hawking expedition to Lingah, a murderous assault of the type, which had become common in Bahrain but which it may be hoped is to be the last one, was perpetrated by Arabs, led by members of the A1 Khalifa family, on certain SShiali villagers of Sitra, several of whom were killed and wounded^The crime was successfully dealt with. A number of convicted persons were sent to Sukkur J ail in India. The leaders were sentenced to death though they had escaped to Qatar. A serious epidemic of plague, introduced probably from Dibai, overran the islands in April and May. It is estimated that 4,000 deaths occurred. The pearl trade was somewhat dull. The chief causes were the disquieting fluctuations of exchange between the rupee and the franc, and the appearance in the market of Japanese cultured pearls. These apparently can only be distinguished from genuine pearls under X-ray examination. As regards the much discussed oil concession, the negotiations between the State and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have made no progress. This is still due partly to the competition of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and partly to the general reluctance of the upper class to admit into their midst so large a community of privileged persons as the successful Company will employ when they proceed to work. Kuwait.— chief event of the year was the Conference of Arab States, presided over by Lieut.-Col. Knox at Kuwait, which was attended by represent atives from Iraq, Trans-Jordania, Najd and Kuwait. The failure of Hejaz representatives to appear made the proceedings almost abortive, though a number of minor questions between Iraq and Najd were tentatively settled. Major More has fully related the series of raids and counter-raids which occurred, between Nejd and Iraq and Najd and Kuwait. The main intention of the Ikhwan (Akhwan) was undoubtedly to punish the sections of their tribes who had seceded from Ibn Saud's rule. The Sultan generally expressed regret and willingness to give compensation if Iraq or Kuwait subjects were injured. At the same time he maintained that his people's raids were reprisals for injuries inflicted on them by his rebellious subjects. Diplomatic relations between Kuwait and Najd remained generally good in spite of the raids and the attempts of the Sultan to prevent imports for Najd passing through the, Kuwait Custom House. The Eastern and General Syndicate, following up their success of 1922 with Najd, have obtained an oil concession from the Rulers of Najd and Kuwait jointly in regard to the Neutral Zone area of these two States. The inhabitants of Kuwait are very averse to the granting of a concession in their territory. Najd.—In the early part of the year, the Sultan of Najd, Abdul Aziz bin Saud, was directing from Hasa the conduct of his delegates to the Kuwait Conference of Arab States. As soon as the Conference's failure was recognized, raids and counter- raids across the Najd borders were the order of the day. From August onwards His Highness was fully occupied with affairs in Western Arabia. He reached Mecca about the middle of November. The Sultan's correspondence which passed through the Bahrain Political Agency and this Residency was always conciliatory in tone. Slave Trade. —In May the fact came to notice that the slave dealers of Central Arabia had commenced to export to the east coast for sale numbers of u white ' girls who had been raided in their infancy from the Christian districts of the Turkish Empire in Asia. The Political Agent, Bahrain, heard of five girls who had been taken via Kuwait and Bahrain to Qatar. The Political Agent, Kuwait, also heard that a number of notables in his town had recently acquired white (Armenian) women. Major Daly cleverly succeeded in getting the five girls returned to Bahrain. But then, it may almost be said, our difficul ties began. One, who was enceinte, insisted on returning to her master, a Persian in Shaikh Abdallah bin Jasim's service. The four others were sent in charge of two American Missionary ladies to Basrah. After a good deal of trouble with the local authorities they were declared entitled to freedom and were made over to four Christian families for adoption. Within a few weeks two of them disappeared ! They were probably enticed away by Muslim fanatics who objected to their second conversion. : It is evident that these girls, who have forgotten their own language ^nd religion, are happy enough in the houses of well-to-do Arabs. Nowadays, slaves do not seek freedom unless they are ill-fed or have been Severely punished. In the latter case they are probably idle and vicious, so that they go from bad to worse after being manumitted.Resume.—To mm up, I may almost repeat word for word wliat my predecessor wrote last year. As regards Persia, the year has been one of general progress. The stability of the Capital is being extended to the outlying parts. Roads are safer. More reverie has been collected. The main problem before the country is that of balancing the national budget. When Reza Khan is able to reduce his military expenditure this should Hot be a difficult matter. Now that the arbitrary rule Of the Shaikh of Muhammerah has been crushed, it is quite possible that British trade in general, and the affairs of the 1 Anglo-Persian Oil Company in particular will benefit not only fn Arabistan and Khuzistan, but perhaps all the way to Tehran. On the Arabian side Ibn Saud is the outstanding character and factor. It remains to be seen how far his ambition will carry him, and whether he escapes the pitfalls that are in his way. Reforms in Bahrain are proceeding quietly. Muscat finances give some promise of improvement. Kuwait is getting poorer, through the jealousy of Ibn Saud. On the backward Trucial Coast there has been little change. CHAPTER II ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1924 Bushire and Hinterland. S ection 1. Personnel.

Richmond, C.B., Commander in Chief H. M.'s Ships and vessels, East Indies Station, visited Bushire from the 24th to the 27th October, S ection 5. Local Government Governor of the Gulf Ports. —Nasr-ed-Douleh was Governor until the 28th May, when he was ordered to hand over charge to the Karguzar, Muazzad-es- Sultan, as he had been accused of taking bribes in connection with the Lirawi- dispute. He was friendly in his attitude towards the British, but not of a suffi ciently strong character to be more than an amiable nonentity. Viqar-ul-Mulk,- who succeeded him, took over charge on his arrival on the 22nd June. He is also of a friendly disposition towards the British, but is handicapped by lack of c.riving power and lack of wealth, and by the fact that the military are the real power in the land. He has, however, been fairly active in municipal matters and has attempted to improve local security. Karguzar. —Muazzad-es-Sultan was Karguzar until the 4th November. He' was anti-British in his tendencies, and was very difficult to deal with, magnify ing every trifle that he could take up. On representations being made by His Majesty's Consul-General, the Legation at Tehran were able to obtain his 1 reiief, and Agha Muhammad Mirza Ali Khan, Muntasir-ul-Mulk, O.B.E., arrived .and took over charge on the 4th November. He is a much more pleasant man to deal with and definitely friendly, but perhaps deterred, by the difficulties of appearing outwardly pro-British and of falling foul of the ruling power, the- nnlitary, from appearing as pro-British as he would wish to be. Lc390FDFinance Department. —Hakim-ul-Mamalek remained throughout the year as local Controller. The year has been again an active one. The Land Tax was increased by 35 per cent, in October. Early in the year an order was re ceived from Tehran for the disarming of Dashti and Hayat Daud, but on the advice of Mirza Taqi Khan, Head of the Cossacks, it was rescinded, and on the Khans of Dashti promising to pay up half their arrears of revenue, the troops were withdrawn, leaving only a few picke. Later in May a force was despatched to Dashti by the Acting Governor-General of Fars to collect out standing revenue to the extent of about 12,000 tumans. The Khan of Bahadur Rig also paid up 6,000 tumans this year, and has pro mised to pay a further 6,000 tumans in the course of the next six years. S ection 6. Military. ihe Military ascendency in every sphere of Government continued to be observed throughout the year. His Highness Reza Khan, Prime Minister of Persia and Commander in Chief of the Imperial Forces, passed through Bushire in November en route for Khuzistan to settle the rebellion of the Shaikh of Muhammerah. He arrived on the 25th November from Shiraz and left on the 26th for Bandar Dilam. Sartip Fazlullah Khan, Commanding the Troops at Shiraz, visited Bushire from the 26th to the 29th May and inspected the troops there. The disposition of the forces in the Bushire area was estimated to be roughly as follows at the beginning and close of the year: J Ist January. 31st December. Men. Men. Bushire .. 100 130 Borazjun .. 100 50 Behbehan 80 to 100 \ 2,500* ' Dilwar .. 10 3 Lingah „ .. .. 60 50 Dashti .. 400 30 Dilum .. 15 400* The discipline and morale of the Troops appear to be much as they were last year. They take themselves quite seriously, are fairly punctually paid, and would have to be reckoned with by anybody. A hangar for the Aerodrome was made by the Persians in January, and there has been much energy shown locally. Free flights were given in February to local notables, and in March an aeroplane flew to Shiraz. S ection 7. The Political Situation. The two political storms which broke over Tehran and Central Persia, the pro-republican movement at the beginning and the defection of the Shaikh of Muhammerah at the end of the year, passed over Bushire and the immediate hinterland with little more effect on the customary apathy of the population than a vague anxiety among the more influential Khans, as to what would be the ultimate effect on themselves, their property and position, of events over which they had no control. The military authorities in Bushire made some attempt to promote a pro-republican movement in the town itself, but the mer chants showed themselves completely uninterested. The increases are due to the expedition against His Highness the Shaikh of Muhammera 1News of the full force and import of Reza Khan's bid for a republic had hardly reached Bushire when the movement suddenly fizzled out at Nauroz^ forcing Reza Khan to resign office and leave the country to find a new leader. His subsequent reinstatement as Prime Minister found Bushire quite willing to accept any turn of events, dictated by the military, whose influence remained supreme. The struggle between the Shaikh of Muhammerah and the Persian Gov ernment brought the storm centre closer to Bushire. It seemed at one time that the Shaikh with the support of the Lurs and the Bhakhtiari was about to declare himself as the champion of the Khans of South Persia, whose independence as well as his own had recently been seriously undermined. During this critical period Ilaidar Khan of Hayat Daud more than once solicited the advice of the Political Resident as to the course which in his own interest he should best adopt. He was advised to take the utmost care to do nothing to arouse the least suspicion that he was not a loyal subject of the Persian Government, which hardly a year ago he had publicly professed himself to be, Haidar Khan wisely acted on this advice, and there is little doubt that by so doing he saved himself from sharing the fate of his son-in-law, Ahmad Khan Angali, who was arrested by the military apparently to prevent the possibility of his assisting the Shaikh of Muhammerah. With the arrival of the Prime Minister himself at Bushire on the 25th November and the subsequent collapse of the Shaikh, the local Khans were forced 1 to abandon any hopes they may have momentarily entertained of a return to their old independence. The attitude of strict aloofness from all connection with the pro-republican movement adopted by this Residency in accordance with instructions received from H. M.'s Legation, and the friendly efforts of H. M.'s Government towards a settlement of the crisis in Arabistan seem to have stifled efjjpctively any recru descence of anti-British feeling in Bushire. If the growth of definite anglophile tendencies can hardly at present be observed, some satisfaction may be derived from the fact that the year has been successful in establishing still more firmly the control and authority of a stable Government in Persia. Though a distrust of foreign influence may be the immediate result, there can be no doubt that the present conditions in Persia make for an increase in British trade and, it is hoped, a fuller confidence in the disinterested^ policy of H. M.'s Government. S ection 8. Trade and Trade Facilities, Trade. —During the year adverse trade balance has been reversed, and there was a small margin of Exports over Imports. The figures indicate a general improvement, but business has been heavily handicapped owing to the continued tightness of money, due largely to the prevailing system of monopolies and to the continued embargo by the Persian Government on the export of grain, lamb skins, silver, etc. Large importers, too, are hampered by the villagers having no money until their opium crop has been purchased. Communications.—The Shiraz road was just passable for motors up to the end of November, but the heavy rains then rendered it impracticable except for animals. The actual security of the road however, improved during the year owing to the presence of the Persian regular troops. Postal Facilities. —These showed a great improvement under M. Chauviaux, and approached a very much higher level of efficiency. Unfortunately, he left on the 22nd October and was replaced by a Persian, M. Arjmand, who is a very poor substitute. There is now a great deal to be desired, particularly in the delivery of par cels, which are greatly delayed. S ection 9. Miscellaneous. ' Two British subjects, Messrs. M. B. Hicks of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., Shiraz, and G. P. Cox, motor mechanic, left Bushire for Shiraz on the 26th October. Their car broke down near Churun, a village 40 miles south of Kazerun, and Mr. Cox went to the village to obtain assistance. He was obstructed by Bahman Khan, local chief of'the Road Guards. A quarrel ensued, and Mr. Cox struck8 the man, who died after an hour and a half. Messre. Cox and Hicks were de tained by the Road Guards until they heard of Bahman Khan's death, when one of them shot Mr. Cox dead at a range of two yards y when all the Gruards decamped. The news reached Bushire on the morning of the 27th, and Major Nicholson, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon, accompanied by Mr. Clarke of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., Bushire, and a Persian Naib, proceeded to the scene and performed autopsies on the bodies. Yawar Ali Asghar Khan, Commanding the Troops in Bushire, also proceeded as far as Borazjun. H. M.'s Consul, Shiraz motored down to Churun, accompanied by a Persian officer, Yawar Qasim Khan, and collected evidence regarding the incident. Mr. Cox was buried at Kunar Takhteh on the 28th, and H. M. 's Legation have taken up the matter. _ An incident occurred on the 10th September at Ganaweh, when Haik Azizian, a telegraph operator of the Indo-European, Telegraph Department, stabbed Sub-Assistant Surgeon Sobhraj of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at night in the back. It appeared that the latter had gone to the house of the former at night and entered a room in which Haik's wife was in bed. Haik chased the Sub-Assistant Surgeon out and got a knife and stabbed him. The Karguzar, Gulf Ports, investigated the case at our , request, but as the evidence was scanty, he decided that no sentence should be passed, in view of Haik hav ing already been under suspension for three months. The Sub-Assistant bur geon was discharged from service by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and will not be re-employed by them. APPENDIX I. Memorandum by Major M. A. Nicholson, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf, on the working of the Resi dency Dispensary and Charitable Hospital, Bushire; and the Quarantine Administration in the Gulf for the year 1924. Personnel. —Major Pierpoint, I.M.S., went on leave March 26th, 1924.. Cap tain Rooney, LM.S.,. the Senior Medical Officer* Persian Gulf Ports (Military), then officiated as Residency Surgeon in addition to his other duties, until the arrival of Major M^., A. Nicholson,, I.M.S., who took over from him on 17th Sep tember 1924. The Residency Dispensary and Charitable Hospital, Bushire. —Owing to the absence of a substantive Residency Surgeon for six months of. the year, very little progress was possible in the task of converting this ins^tution from a Dis pensary Basis to that of a Hospital. Much necessary equipment, such as beds and bedding, etc., have yet to be supplied; while the problem of the staff necessary for the care of In-Patients, and of their quarters remains as yet unsettfed. The following table shows, the work dona during, 1924,, in comparison witJi the two previous years:— 1921. 1923.. 1922. Out-Door Attendances .. 18,747 10,776 13 461 In Patient Admiss'ons .. ..

The Quarantine Service. —With the Persian Quarantine the usual difficul ties arose. At one time payments were six months in arrears. On the. Arab side financial obligations were duly and promptly carried out. Plague. —At Dibai on the Trucial Coast Plague continued from the previous year. The outbreak was severe- but as there are no Quarantine or Medical Staff, at this place, figures of cases and case mortality are not available.The outbreak created considerable panic amongst the population of Dibai, 'vv-ho fled wholesale to Bahrein, Lingah, Kishm Island, Bunder Abbas, and their adjacent coasts. The voyage was usually made in sailing vessels, with the fixed intention of avoiding being quarantined. By landing on secluded parts of the Coast, well away from any Port, a certain number evaded the regular Quarantine Service. The Persian Authorities were requested to put a stop to this procedure; but it was usually not until the request had been repeated or the force of the request brought home to them by the appearance of plague within their limits that they attempted to tackle the very difficult problem in an effective manner. Plague was thus introduced into Lingah, Bunder Abbas and Kishm Island on the Persian side and into Bahrein on the Arab Side. Plague also appeared at Mohamerah and Abadan, being probably, imported litre from Basrah. The single case of plague in Bushire was traced to Mohammerah. The following table details the number of cases of Plague and the case mor tality actually reported at the various Ports during the year. It must be remembered that save at the Anglo-Persian Oil Companies Sta tion at Abadan, no regular Health Service exists within any of these Ports &lt; and that these figures only represent the number of cases and deaths coming to the personal knowledge of the Quarantine Medical Officer concerned. They in no way represent the full extent of the outbreak. Thus the Quaran tine Medical Officer only reports the 31 cases with 3 deaths seen by himself Tit kishm Island during his visits there. From local reports given to him he estimates that the total number of deaths from Plague on Kishm while the epidemic lasted was probably nearly four hundred:— — Cases. Deaths.

SUMMARY FOR EARS. (Prepared from the Diaries of the Consul, Shiraz). This does not pretend to be more than a brief resume of the situation in Fars for the calendar year 1924, which, though on the whole an uneventful year, was actually filled with, the tjross currents of factions struggling with one another for supremacy. Civil Government. —His Highness Nusrat-ud-Douleh, G. C. M. G., as stated in last year's report, accepted his election as Deputy to the Mejlis for Kerman- shah and left for Tehran on the 12th March. No permanent successor was ap pointed for nearly six months, and Mushirus Sultan, delegate from the Ministry of the Interior for the conduct of the elections, acted as Governor-General until the 20th June, when orders from Tehran brought his term of office to a close, whereafter Mutarjim-ul-Mulk, Director of the Persian Telegraph Office, was ordered on the 7th July to officiate, which he did nntil His Excellency Vossugh-ud- Douleh, who had been appointed permanently, arrived on 22nd August. Local Politics. —Sartip Fazlullah Khan Zahidi, Commanding the Shiraz Bri gade, a young and pushful soldier, with desires on a political rather than a mili tary career, and the immediate goal, the military governor-generalship of Ears aided by the extremist newspapers, was zealous in stirring up anti-dynastic and pro-republican feeling in Shiraz in March. The leaders of the ^ democratic ' extremist faction held meetings outside the town gate in the first place, and then, becoming bolder, inside the town itself. Inevitably anti-British feeling was drag ged in, and people were urged to refrain from buying British goods. On the 1st April a circular telegram was received from the Prime Minister which threatened to punish anyone advocating, or mentioning even, a republic, and which directed the agitation to be dropped. This had very little effect on12 the agitation, which was still kept up by the military, though the general public- had by the middle of the month lost interest in the question. In July a military governor was appointed at Kazerun, and on the 1st August martial law was proclaimed in Shiraz, Yawar-Muhammad Taqi Khan Arab appointed Deputy Grovernor-General, and strict censorship imposed over both the Postal and Telegraph Departments. The General Officer Commanding warned the Mullahs and others against making political speeches in mosques, and threatened to enforce this order strictly. However, on the Governor-General's arrival the General Officer Coliimanding was informed by the Prime Minister that his position was inferior to the Governor-General's, though the Military Deputy Governor-General continued in office. Martial Law and the cersorship however, still remained in force, and civil authority was therefore much curtailed. TI iq quasi-military regime was not popular and in September the censorship was removed, and in October there was a meeting of the clergy to protest against the control of the military, and there was a strong demand for Shirazis to be appointed, aiid not Tehranis, to the higher posts at Shiraz. The Amir Lashkar in Janub arrived at Shiraz at the end of August, and it was clear that he and the General Officer Commanding Shiraz did not hit it off. The General Officer Commanding is an ambitious soldier politician and considered himself as good as his superior officer. He entertained hopes of his Brigade being made independent, and went on leave to Tehran to see what he could do. Finance Department.—The mullas and their party were pleased when earlv in the year they received a telegram from the Prime Minister which promised action in connection with their protest against the Araq distillerv, which had been officially established ' coram publico ' by the Finance Director ^in a building on a main avenue outside the town. The latter had two objects in view in estab lishing this central distillery : (1) the localisation of the distillery in one building instead of several, and the consequent facilities that this would give him for collecting the excise tax, and (2) the removal of the nauseating smells inherent in the process from the streets of the Jewish Quarter. The promised action resulted in-the distillery being closed in March, but, as all utensils were left there., no araq was made at all. In August, however, the distillery was re-opened, and though there was a little disturbance, it was easily suppressed. Opium. —^Warehouses were erected by the Finance Department during the year to enforce greater strictness in, and control over, the opium trade. Hither to merchants had been allowed to conduct the preparation of the crude drug on their own premises, and no attempt was made to enforce the banderole rules as to the sale of sticks for smoking. Colonel D. W. MacCormack, United States Financial Adviser, reached Shiraz in April to settle difficulties with the landowners and merchants re the new Government Regulations concerning opium cultivation and preparation. A settlement was reached estimated to bring in additional revenue of 60,000 to 70,000 Tumans per annum. While in Shiraz, he also obtained agreements for increased revenue from Qawam-ul-Mulk, Soulat-ud-Douleh and Sardiar Ashair. Soulat-ud-Douleh. —At the beginning of the year the Prime Minister telegra phed to the General Officer Commanding Shiraz to seize and return to Sardar Ihtesham and his full brother, Ali Khan Salar Hishmat, their estates, which had been possessed by the half brother Soulet-ud-Douleh for some years. The General Officer Commanding deferred compliance until Soulat reached Tehran, ^ le ^ &gt;I ^ me Minister hoped to be able to force a settlement on all the parties and heal the open sore which has been the cause of the Qashqai dissensions for the past 18 years. Other Khans. —In September the troubles in Arabistan began to make them- ai T ( ^ ^ ie militar y arrested Salar Ashja, son of Shaikh Husain Chakutai, and Ahmad Khan Angali, presumably to prevent them assisting the Shaikh of Muhammerah. The former was very spon released. In October most of the Khans and tribal chiefs were persuaded to send Inval telegrams to the Prime Minister, who wired to the General Officer Commanding instructing him to make the local mullas also declare themselves as opposed to the Shaikh. His Excellency Qawam-ul-Mulk was requested by telegram to offer a force of tribesmen to assist the military. He replied after some delay that he was always ready to ob6y the orders of his Government, but that jt would be very13 difficult to comply vnik this request of the Prime Minister, and that unless he collected a large number of tribesmen and himself assumed the learclership he did not believe that any tribal expedition would be prac ticable, since a small body of tribesmen would never reach Arabistan as the men would desert on the road and return to the hills, while on the other hand it womd take two or three months to assemble a large force of tribesmen. He received a reply from the Prime Minister that the latter was anxious for the moral support of the tribal chiefs against the Shaikh, and requesting the Qawam to furnisli 100 armed horsemen to be placed at the disposal of the military, and adding that a larger force would not be requested from the Khamseh \ribe. The Qashquis, who had also been addressed, supplied SO horsemen. Visit or Prime Minister. —His Highness Reza Khan, Sirdar Sepah, passed through Shlraz at the end of November on his way to the front and was accom panied by Amir Iqtidar, Minister of the Interior, Sardar Assad, Minister of Posts .and Telegraphs and Amir-I-Lashkar-I-Janub and others. When in Shiraz, as a result of petitions, he tried to get surplus stocks of grain from Isfahan and Kerman to alleviate the distress caused by high prices. He was sncocssful and his measures had an appreciable result. Miscellmieovs.' —Highway robberies were as frequent as ever durmg the year, every month producing its quota, Mir Mazkur being as usual well to the fore. The year ended with heavy rainstorms, completely dislocating all traffic on the Isfahan-Shiraz-Bushire Road. CHAPTER IV. Consular District of Bandar Abbas. ADMINISTHATIOH EEPOET FOR 1924. P eksonnel. Bandar Ahhas.—Mr. Gr. A. Richardson, O.B.E., held the post of His Majesty's Vice Consul with the personal rank of Consul throughout the year. Lmgah. —Assistant Surgeon S. G. Jackson held the post of Residency and Consular Agent till the 24th April, when he was relieved by Assistant Surgeon E. M. Cuzen. Assistant Surgeon Cuzen proceeded on leave to India on the 8th June and re turned and. resumed charge of his duties on the 10th November. Dnring his absence Assistant Surgeon E. T.

Bandar Abbas. —Agha Hassan Hoshiyar, Salar-i-Nizam, held the office of Governor of Bandar Abbas and Minab up to the 28th November, when he was dismissed and Mirza Ali Nakhi Khan, Wathiq-i-Huzoor, appointed Deputy Gover nor of Bandar Abbas and the Islands. Wathiq-i-Huzoor arrived from Bushire and assumed charge of his post on the 8th December, 1924, the Kargnzar Agha Sadid-es-Sultaneh officiating in the meantime. It will jbe observed that the Bandar Abbas post which was raised to a Governorship under the Ministry of the Interior in June 1923, has been reduced to that of Deputy Governor and placed once more under the control of the Governor of the Gulf Ports at Bushire. Salar-i-Nizam's personal relations with H. B. M. Consul were friendly throughout his tenure of office at Bandar Abbas but in his official capacity he was not very helpful, and inclined to be lazy. It was difficult to elicit a reply from him when addressed on matters affecting British interests. It was generally agreed that he was weak and incompetent and moreover corrupt. Wathiq-i-Huzoor his successor was Deputy Governor of Lingah before secur ing his present post from the Governor of the Gulf Ports. LcBgoPD14 He appears to be friendly and! on paying his first official call to H. B. M. Consul was not slow in declaring his pro-British tendencies. Lincfah. —Mir Jafar, Debir-i-Akram, the Deputy Governor was dismissed on the 21st March and gave over charge to Hisam-uI-Wazura the Karguzar on pro ceeding to Tehran. He was succeeded on the 14th July by Agha Wathiq-i-Hnzoor who held the post till the 7th November when he was relieved by the present incumbent Alt Akbar Khan* Movaqqir-ul-Mulk. Debir-i-Akram was a weak and vacillating official. Ali Akbar Khan is 26 years of age and is described by ; our Consular Agent as u carrying a grey head on green shoulders y '. Minah. —Qaid Muhammad Ali Khan continued to officiate as Deputy Gover nor till the 13th January when he was relieved by one of Salar-i-Nizam's satellites Sheikh Abdul Ali. Sheikh Abbas, a former Deputy Governor, took over charge on January 27th and remained in office till the 22nd June. Sheikh Abdul Ali already referred to and Mirza Eeza Khan officiated in turn till the arrival on the 30th August of the new Deputy Governor Agha Salar-i- Ihtesham who held the appointment till the end of the year. The acting arrangements at Minab were made to serve Salar-i-Nizam's pri vate interests. The appointment has now been separated from the Bandar Abbas admini stration and transferred to the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The present incumbent, Agha Salar-i-Ihtesham, promises to do well and a marked improvement in the condition of the Minab district generally has been observed since he arrived-there. The claims and grievances of British Indian traders have received greater attention and the present Deputy Governor appears anxious to work in Co-opera tion with H. B. M. Consulate. Kishm Island. —The appointment of a Governor of the Islands in the Persian Oulf with headquarters on Kishm Island and under the direct control of the Cen tral Government was created as an experiment in March, 1924. The first incumbent, Mirza Ahmed Khan, Mushar-i-Afkham, arrived from Tehran and took over his duties at Kishm Island on the 23rd March, but resigned after-a very short stay and left for the Persian Capital via Bushire on the 15th May. The post was abolished on account of the Mejliss refusing to vote the necessary funds for its maintenance. The administration of the Islands then reverted to the jurisdiction of the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas. Karguzar ate. Bandar Ahbas. —Sadid-es-Sultaneh continued to hold office throughout the year. Harmonious relations were steadily maintained between the Karguzarate and H. B. M. Consulate. Agha Sadid although friendly enough is neither a firm competent official. He is evidently afraid of the steady nationalist intrigue prevalent in this district, while very fond of intrigue himself. His secret reports to Tehran are generally incorrect and exaggerated. Lingah.—Agha, Hisam-el-Wazareh remained in office throughout the year. He proceeded on two months' leave to Bushire in August and September, the prin cipal object of his visit to the Chief Karguzar at headquarters being to consoli date his position at Lingah. Agha Hisham-el-Wazareh is a wily individual, corrupt and disolute, and may be described as ' degenerate '. Although assuring H. B. M. Consul on his visit to Lingah at the end of 1923 that better relations between himself and the Agency would be cultivated in future, he has persisted in his obstructive and evasive tractics when British cases are referred to his Court. A change of the present Karguzar at Lingah is called for in the interests pf both the Persian Goyetnment and ourselves.15 Finance Depabtment. Bandar Abhas. —Mirza Abdul Reza Khan held the appointment of Finance Agent throughout 1924. Several questions arose with the Finance Department owing to its demand for the payment of taxes which had not previously been collected from foreign subjects in Persia. The Finance Agent was acting in such cases under instructions from Bushire and Tehran, but is himself amenable to reason in his dealings in general with H. 3. M. Consulate. Agha Hakim-ul-Mamalik, the Director of Finance at Bushire paid a visit to Bandar Abbas between the 22nd February and 7th March. Lingah. —Mirza Khalil was removed from the post of Finance Agent in January, as the result of the visit of inspection paid in December, 1923, by Mirza Humayan Khan, an Inspector of the Ministry of Finance. Mirza Farajullah Khan held charge till 26th June when he was relieved by Mirza Maliomed Hussain Khan from Bushire. With the «xit of Mirza Khalil, the perpetual friction at Lingah for many years between the local authorities and the Consular Agency disappeared. Except for a few instances in which it was attempted, unsuccessfully, to im pose on British subjects payment of Mustaghilat taxes, no trouble was experienc ed during the incumbency of the present agent, who is not unfriendly on the whole. Mimh —Mirza SSdiq Khan proceeded on leave to Ispahan in Angnst having been relieved in the duties of Amin-i-Maliyeh by Mnstapha Khan, Amm-i-Darbar. Customs. Bandar Abhas.—Mosienr H. Paqnet held charge of the post of Director of Customs throughout the year. His relations with H. B. M. Consulate were most cordial and his regime was beneficial to British trade interests. On his arrival at Bandar Abbas he found the conduct of affairs in the Cus toms in a very lethargic state but he soon got a move on, weeded out useless and incompetent members of his staff and accomplished much towards reorgam- zation of his department locally. . li? . . , He effected several improvements in the Customs House itself m the shape of sadly needed repairs of warehouses but was hampered from doing more on account of lack of funds. ^ Monsieur Paquet deserve^ great credit for the work done by htm under ardu- ous circumstances, . „ -o The increased revenues that will be realised at the end of the Persian year are noUn a small measure due to his assiduity and vigilant supervision over his subordinates . „ ,, p.

Syed Zamoon continued in office throughout the year. He is young, an adept in intrigue, and an intimate associate of the notori- ous Karguzar. _ His administration of the post office is not satisfactory and several com plaints were received in regard to delays in the distribution of correspondence. Mma6.—There was no change and Mirza Hussain Bushiri continued in olhce throughout the year. P ersian T elegraph D epartment. Bandar Abbas. Haji Khan, the Rais-i-Telegraph was transferred to iiushire as acting Director in June and the post has been held since bv his brother Mirza Ali Akbar Khan. Haji Khan amassed a small fortune during his tlfree years tenure of office partly by divulging official news and by black-mailing local officials. It is believed that he was subsidised by Salar-i-Nizam in order to ensure his position. M unicipality. Bandar Abbas. —Meshedi Ali, the Rais-i-Baladiyia was dismissed in Febru ary and the direction of Municipal affairs taken over by Salar-i-Nizam. A committee consisting of local officials and merchants was appointed shortly afterwards and may ambitious schemes, inter alia, electric light for the town, the laying down of a pipe line to bring drinking water from Naiband and the installation of an ice-plant, were projected. These however, did not materialise owing to the private members quarrelling with the Governor and demanding public elections. The question was referred to Tehran. In the meantime, the sanitation of the town continued to be neglected and the municipal receipts misappropriated by the Governor's satellites. Lingah. —Here too, the Baladyia merely exists on paper and no attempt at municipal work is made. In February, Haji Ahmed Hakim was selected by the merchants as Rais-i- Baladyia. He is prehistoric and his only qualification for the post appears to^ be his i grey beard , . Taxes continue to be levied and the Deputy Governor Ali Akbar Khan casts longing eyes in the direction of the municipality over which he is en deavouring to obtain full control, as he realises that there is money to be made. P ersian A rmy, Bandar Abbas. —Naib Ali Asghar Khan was in Command of the' detach ment throughout the year.17 The strengtli of his Command which is under the Kerman Army, and in cludes Minab and Jask consisted of 200 Infantry, 20 Sowars mounted on horses and camels, one machine gun and two small guns used for salutes. The garrison of Bandar Abbas comprised 120 Infantry and ten Sowars. Naib-Awwal Mirza Ali Khan Naseri who arrived from Kerman on 24th November with reinforcements, assumed Command of the local garrison on the departure for Minab on the lUth December of Naib Ali Asghar Khan in con nection with military operations it was intended to take against Bahadur-es- Sultan Mir Barakat Khan of Biyaban. The health of the troops stationed at Bandar Abbas, of whom some thirty nien have been recruited locally showed a decided improvement over the pre vious year. Naib-Awwal Khalil Khan, of the Medical Services, who arrived from Kerman in October, 1923, was in medical charge throughout the year. The troops present a far smarter turn out than formerly and are drilled regularly. Their conduct however, leaves much to be desired. Frequent complaints 'against the military for excesses committed in the town were received, but Naib Ali Asghar Khan who is himself a dissolate and corrupt officer took no steps to grant redress to the wretched inhabitants. A serious incident occurred during the Mohurram procession on the 12th August when some regulars forcibly entered the house of an Indian shopkeeper, arrested him and another British subject, and maltreated both whilst being led to the barracks. The incident was provoked by certain of the townspeople observing two Persian women of questionable character enter the house in question, and making a report to a non-commissioned officer whose men were patrolling the streets on the occasion. The troops were paid very irregularly as their Officer Commanding, it was an open secret, traded with the money received from Kerman for the disburse ment of their salaries. Naib Mirza Ali Khan, the present acting Commandant who comes from a military stock has a smart appearance and is said to be a capable officer. During the year under review there has been a growing tendency hitherto lying dormant, on the part of the military to usurp civil power, a tendency from which Naib Mirza Ali is not immune. Minab. —The detachment stationed here was under the Command ofaNaib Mahmood Khan who on relief by Naib : Sani (2nd-Lieut.) Mirza Hussain Khan in November, proceeded to Kerman. Thirty Infantry-men are ordinarily posted at Minab but owing to projected operations against Mir Barakat, the strength of the force was increased by the end of the year to 100 men with one machine gun. J ash.—On the 6th March, 30 men in Command oi Naib Syed Ahmed Khan arrived from Kerman and were despatched to garrison Jask. Ling ah. —Yawar Ali Asghar Khan, who came from Bushire in September 1923 and established a regular garrison, handed over Command to Naib Munir Huzoor in February, 1924. The latter was recalled to Bushire in June owing to numerous complaints against him for extortion preferred by the townsfolk. Vakil Bashi Asghar Khan was left in charge of the detachment till he was relieved on August 29th by Naib Abdulla Khan. This officer was recalled in November for his bad handling of the case of the S.S. ' Monadnock ' which will be referred to later. Agha Amir Khan Sherwani succeeded, and was in command at the close of the year. The strength of the garrison was between fifty and sixty but it is expected that this will be increased to 100 and barrack accommodation is oeing arranged accordingly. The men possess a smart military bearing, are efficient at drill but are badly clothed. , Lc390FD ,18 Ag-ha Amir Khan whilst inclined to be intensely patriotic, is a chronic alcoholic, addicted to opium and is reputed to indulge in every sort of vice. Encouraged by the weakness and incompetence of the local officials the military element has during the year under review made further progress in the direction of interfering in, if not actually assuming charge of the civil administration. In September, owing to a fracas between local coolies and some of the Chinese crew on board the British steamer 44 Monadnock ' that was discharging case kerosene at Lingah, the Officer Commanding troops sent aboard a N. C. 0. and four armed soldiers who arrested the Captain and four Chinese seamen and brought them ashore. They were detained for a short time in the military barracks till released on the intervention of the Consular Agent. This case was ultimately settled at Bushire, The ardour exhibited and the interest evinced in the Persian Troops last year by the local residents, especially the merchants class, as demonstrated by the crowds that assembled every evening to witness them salute when the Persian flag was hauled down at sunset has now completely fizzled out. The cause is not far to seek. The conduct of night patrols whose principal object is to molest women in the streets has disg-usted their former admirers. Instances have also occurred in which doors were broken and private pre mises intruded upon. In August, one of the regulars who was an habitual opium smoker attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself with a rifle whilst on sentry duty at the main barracks. The cause was attributed to ill-treatment at the hands of the Vakil Bashi then in temporary Command of the detachment and also to non-payment of his salary for several months. The N. C. 0. responsible was arrested and taken to Bushire. C ondition of the C ountry. Bandar Abhas Towm.—The town continued to be without a regular police force, whose duties were carried out partly by the Governor's tufangchis and partly by military patrols. Nevertheless, it was fairly free from crime on the whole. No murders were reported during the year, but the dead body of a Persian tailor was found in March on the sea beach opposite the village of Kajita. Foul play was suspected and two arrests made in this connection. After several months' detention the two men were released for want of evidence against them. Two thefts occurred in June, one in which the house of a Persian merchant was broken into at night and cash and clothing valued at 1,640 krans carried off * in the second which occurred the following night, property worth 150 krans was removed from the shop of an Indian goldsmith. Nothing was recovered in the former of these cases, but H. B. M. Consulate succeeded in obtaining compensation for the British subject. In two other instances in which British Indians reported thefts of money and property from their premises, investigations on the part of the authorities went to show that no access to such premises of the complainants had been obtained from external sources, and the evidence recorded by the Consulate supported the conclusions arrived at. Lingah.*—The Badio Station of the Indo-European Telegraph Station was reported to have been broken into on the 12th January and Bs. 5,258 and a bundle of confidential documents said to have been stolen. Prolonged enquiries into the matter by the local authorities failed to elicit any clue to this burglary and nothing was recovered. In February, a Persian accused of stealing a razor was severely flogged by the Officer Commanding Troops on two consecutive days, and died from the effects of the castigation on the second day. In July, the corpse of a man was found in a water tank about a mile from the town. Foul play was suspected but subsequent investigations revealed nothing.BandaT Ahhas District. —In view of the presence of a stronger Persian force at Bandar Abbas, internal disorder except in the outlying district of Biyaban was not so marked as in previous years. In July some fighting occurred between rival Zabits at Kishar in the vicinity of Bandar Abbas and resulted in a few casualties. On August 18th a local merchant Haji Ali Surooi, was kidnapped bv Kouri- stanis a few miles from this town but was released a few days later 'by Syed Abdullah of Biyaban who pursued the tribesmen. Minah—Thefts were rife in the town in the early part of the year, due chiefly to the activities of the followers of the notorious outlaws Ibrahim Khan and Abbas Khan, encouraged to a great extent by the inaction of Salar-i-Nizam. After a momentary lull, the depredations of the above mentioned brigands Were extended to the surrounding villages and assumed somewhat serious pro portions in August, It is true that four or five persons were arrested by the authorities, but no recovery or restitution of stolen property in the majority of instances was recorded. There was a decided improvement in the^ condition of the Minab district in the last three months of the year under review, attributable to its separation from the Bandar Abbas administration, and the appointment of Salar-i- Ihtesham as Deputy Governor. The strengthening of the garrison had a bene ficial effect too. On December 16th, a small body of regulars under Naib Sani Mirza Hussain Khan accompanied by Kaid Mahomed Ali a former Deputy Governor was despatched to Azimabad to arrest Abbas Khan. The latter escaped to Rudan owing to an unfortunate incident en route in which the Vakil Bashi of the detachment was shot accidentally, compelling the force to return. Biyaban.—The chronic state of unrest that has existed in the Minab district for many years can properly be ascribed to the promptings of Mir Barakat Khan and to the activities of his adherents in that locality or of his immediate refractory followers. The attention of the Central Government was directed towards the final subjugation of this notorious Chieftain but preoccupations in other parts of Persia have perhaps stayed their hands in employing military force to attain their object. Early in March Mir Barakat finding himself in a tight corner owing to the presence of an appreciably strong force of regulars based at Minab and drawn from the Kerman army for the purpose of enforcing Zargham-es-Sultaneh, of Eudbar into submission, fled from his stronghold when called upon to present himself at headquarters. He reached Bandar Abbas in a dhow and informed the local authorities that the object of his arrival was to tender his submission to the Persian Government. He put up in the house of an Awazi Contractor for Crown Lands, and al though supposed to be under military surveillance, secretly left for his country at the end of March. _ During his stay, he was summoned to the Telegraph Office and had conver sations on two occasions with the Officer Commanding at Kerman. It is believed that Salar-i-Nizam and the Officer Commanding Troops at Bandar Abbas both connived at Mir Barakat's departure. Towards the close of the year, the Central Government, owing to the fact of their having troops to spare near at hand were in a more favourable position to take definite action against Mir Barakat who has for years past defied their authority and been a thorn in the administration of this outlying district. It is expected that operations will be shortly undertaken to put an end, for all time, to the depredations of this recalcitrant Chief and establish order and security in the Minab and Biyaban districts. Kishm Island. —Some little trouble occurred during the closing days of 1923 owing to an order issued by the Provincial Director of Customs to leVy teskhera fees. The inhabitants of the village of Kishm who trade in dhows with the Oman Coast resented the order as th#fees had not hitherto been col lected from them.20 A Kishmi on return from Dubai was imprisoned for refusal to pay the tax whereupon the inhabitants surrounded the Zabit's office, assaulted the latter and wounded his Munshi. The Customs and administrative officials fled from the village and came to Bandar Abbas. The Director^ of Customs accompanied by the Governor and the Rais-i~ Kushun visited Kishm village in the above connection. . Later a party of local merchants also proceeded to that place and an amicable settlement was arranged with the inhabitants. In August a band of Kauristani tribesmen from the mainland raided the village of Laft on the Island, looted four houses and carried off 2,500 krans in cash and eight bags of rice. No action appears to have been taken by the authorities nor any result achieved. C ondition of R oads. The security of the routes leading from Bandar Abbas into the interior does not strike the ' powers that be ' as being of very great importance in their own interests as also of trade in general. Little or no attention was paid to this question and except for a few guards from the Amnieh Department at Kerman on the road leading in that direction, other routes were left unprotected, and at the mercy of tribal highway men. Bandar Abbas-—Isin route. —One robbery was reported in June when merchandise belonging to a Persian merchant and valued aj: 2,000 krans was looted by Kauristanis. Bandar Abbas-Kerman route. —A caravan conveying goods belonging to British traders was attacked on the 7th October and two loads of piece-goods worth 2,400 krans carried off. A British Indian subject whilst travelling from Kerman to the coast early in November, reported that his caravan had been attacked en route in the Fars area and he himself robbed of all his belongings valued at Krans one thousand. Bandar Abbas-Minab route. —The state of this road was bad for the first nine months of the year but that of the other routes proceeding from Minab to Rudan and Rudbar, etc., was worse and practically closed during August and September. However, no looting of the property of Indian traders on this road was reported during the year. Lingah.-v-ThSi-nk^ to the very adequate arrangements made by the adminis tration of H. E. the Qawwam-ul-Mulk, the Lar-Lingah road continued to be safe and peaceful throughout the year and not a single case of robbery was reported thereon, A ems T eaffic. No cases were reported during the year in this Consular district. Information from local Custojiis sources was received to the effect that 250 rounds of mauser rifle ammunition imported into Charbar on account of Din Muhammad Khan Baluch was confiscated by that Department in February, but the ammunition was subsequently retaken possession of forcibly by that Chief's Baluch followers. S lave T eaffio. Bandar Abbas. —Seven slaves sought asylum at H. B. M. Consulate. Of these five received manumission papers ; one died of small-pox and one slave absconded before the necessary certificate could be issued. Ling ah. —Six slaves applied for their freedom of whom four had been manumitted up to the end of the year. P ersian N avy. The Gunboat Pehlevi recently acquired by the Persian Government arrived from Aden on the 18th December and sailed for Bu shire on the 27th December. She is a small fuel burning vessel built in Germany and armed in Italy. The Gunboat was brought^ut by a Russian Armenian Skipper and a Ger man Crew, There were no guns on board when she called here.\ 21 There was great excitement when the ' Pehlevi anchored in the roadstead as she had been expected for some time. The local officials and the prominent Persian merchants went on board, but were very much disappointed when they found that the vessel was very small and more of.the type of a revenue steam launch than of a ship of war. A viation. The year under review was a remarkable one for the visits of aircraft. Nine aeroplanes called at Bandar Abbas, comprising two British, three American, one French, one Dutch, one Portuguese and one Argentine. These were (1) the Vickers (Amphibian) in-charge of Squadron Leader A. Stewart Maclaren accompanied by Flying Officer W. N. Penderleith and Ser geant E. Andrews, on her ' round the world ' flight. The machine came via, Baghdad and Bushire and alighted on the sea in front of H. B. M. Consulate at 4-20 p.m ., on the 22nd April and left for Charbar en route to Karachi the following morning. The' aviators were accorded an enthusiastic reception by the officials and towns-people who turned ont in throngs to witness the landing. (2) The French Breguet Biplane (19 AZ type) piloted by Lieut. Polletier D'Oisy of the French Air Service on the Paris-Tokio flight arrived on the 28th April and continued the voyage to Karachi via Charbar the next day. (3) The Portuguese machine, an old Breguet type in charge of Captain A. B. Paes with Captain J. M. De Beires as pilot, en route to Macao, landed on the aerodrome on the 2nd May and proceeded to Charbar the following morn ing. (4) Three United States Air Service Biplanes, engaged in the ' World Flight ' and under the Command of Lieut. Smith arrived from Karachi at 4-45 p.m ., on the 7th July and took off at daylight on the 8th July from the aerodrome.

The aerodrome was maintained in an efficient condition, and with the excep tion of Major MacLaren's Amphibian that alighted on the sea, was utilized by all the aviators referred to above for landing and taking off. Flight-Lieut. Taylor of the Eoyal Air Force arrived on the 18th September to inspect the aerodrome, Air Store Depot and the Petrol dump, and left for Bushire a week later. Lieut. H. Halverson of the.U. S. A. Army Air Force visited Bandar Abbas in May as Advance Officer in connection with the American 4 Bound the World Flight B ritish I ndian T eoops. The Detachment of the 3115th Punjab Eegiment under Captain D. P. G. Shewen based at the Naiband camp, about three miles from Bandar Abbas was relieved on the 10th February by one Indian Officer and 35 other ranks of the 3119th Hyderabad Eegiment with Lieut. B. G. H. Benson iii Command. Captain Shewen accompanied by one Indian Officer and 51 other 'Tanks embarked for India on the 17th February. Colonel D. H. Powell, M.C., A.Q.M., General, Western Command accoim- panied by Major C. V. S. Jackson, R.E., disembarked here for the day, en route to Bushire, on the Srd April and visited Naiband in connection with its evacua tion and the disposal of buildings and military stores at that base. On the 19th July the British military evacuation of Bandar Abbas was carried out by the embarkation for Bushire of 16 Indian other ranks, and the Xip390FDI 22 t transfer of one Indian Officer and il men to H. B. M. Consulate to complete the authorized strength of the guard. The'Military Works personnel were left at Naiband pending the disposal of Machinery and stores and the demolition of the buildings which was decided on.. Mr. Godfrey, A.C.R.E., Persian Gulf Ports visited Bandar Abbas in the above connection on the 21st June and remained till the 7th August. During the year, the following Officers inspected the Indian Troops station ed at Naiband. (1) Lt.-Colonel C. B, Scott, D.S.O., 3[15th Punjab Regiment Commanding Troops, Persian Gulf, arrived on January 9th and proceeded to Jask on January 13th. (2) Major W. C. Kirkwood, O.B.E., 3|19th Hyderabad Regiment landed for the day from the I. G. T. Steamer 44 Patrick Stewart ' on February 25th. (3) Major 0. Masters,.

Robney, I.M.S., Senior Medical Officer, Gulf Ports, inspected the Hospital and lines of the Infantry Guard at H. B. M. Consulate in November. Lieut.-Colonel A. G. Shea, D.S.O., accompanied by Major Masters inspected the Hospital and lines of the Consulate Infantry Guard in December. V isits of H is M ajesty's and F oreign S hips of W ae. Bandar Abbas. —H. M. S. ' Triad ' paid two visits to the port in April and October respectively. Ling ah. —None of His Majesty's ships visited the port during the year. The Royal Indian Marine Steamer ' Lawrence ' called at Bandar Abbas four times during the year and twice at Lingah. Royal Italian Navy. —The Cruiser ' Calabria ,r arrived on the 8th June and sailed for Bushire on the 10th June. During her stay visits were exchanged with H. B. M. Consul and the local authorities. V isits of H is M ajesty's R epresentatives. Bandar Abbas. —The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.L r C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf arrived in the R.LM.S. ' Lawrence ' on the night of the 25th February. He visited H. B. M. Consulate in the forenoon next day and returned td Bushire the same afternoon. Lingah,—En route to Bandar Abbas, the Political Resident called here for a few hours. B ritish I nterests. I ndo- E uropean T elegraph D epartment. During January the wire was cut on this line. Bandar Ahbas-Kerman Telegraph Line, —The culprits were caught and punished by the local authorities and a fine of Krans 350 recovered for the damage done. Again in May, some fifteen insulators were found broken. A sum of 100 krans was recovered from the culprits, who belonged to - a caravan of Farghanis. During the month of November the line was maliciously damaged, near a place called Bandekunaro thirty yards of wire being removed and forty insu lators broken. The damage done was estimated at 270 krans.23 Communication by the lawid line with places in the interior was interrupted for twenty-four hours. In this case, the olfenders could not be traced for want of precise details to identify them. Ling ah Radio Station. —Eeference has been made in another part of this report to the burglary reported to have been committed on the office of this station. A nglo- P eesiak G il C ompaisty. Staff. —Mr. N. Sutherland, the . Company's Manager W Kishm Island on going home was relieved by Mr. A. Sharp. Test wells at Salakh. —Mr. Sharp reports as follows :—Early in January it was finally decided to abandon No. 1 well owing to heavy pressure of salt water and fluid mud being met with at depth 3303 feet. The greatest depth reached was 3305 feet. Some of the casing was withdrawn and the well abandoned. No. 2 Well reached a depth of 1661 feet with small oil shows somewhat higher up but so insignificant that it was decided to abandon this well also and the casing was withdrawn in June. However, some weeks later oil was discovered to be flowing from the well and on being connected to a tank the quantity amounted to 1000 gallons approxi mately per day. Throughout the remainder of the year between 400 and 1600 gallons per diem continued to flow from this well. The oil so obtained was found to be of very high grade and partially refined. No further drilling was done during the year but the abandonment of the Company's operations on Kishm Island was postponed indefinitely. Minerals. —There are three minerals known to exist on the Island namely Salt, Sulphur and Iron pyrites, only one of which is worked, i.e., salt. Salt. —During the year, 6100 tons of rock salt were quarried from the mines at Namakdan, all for the use of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's refinery at Abadan. The sulphur deposits occur near Namakdan - but it is believed that the deposit is not sufficient to pay for working expenses. Iron pyrites exist in small quantities above the salt mines, but apparently their exploitation would not prove a paying concern. Geological Survey in the Bandar Abhas Hinterland. —Messrs. Fowle and Long, Geologists of the Company arrived at Bandar Abbas on the 14th Novem ber and proceeded to the interior towards Khamir for the purpose of making a survey. Later they worked in the direction of Eudan, where oil is said to exist. Ling ah.—X. find of oil from a well dug in an old house purchased by a divine Syed Jafar at the village of Kung, which is about two miles from the town of Lingah was reported in March. Mr. J. McAdam, a Geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company inspected the so-called oil well in August and took samples of the oil found therein. No feports on the result of the examination have been published up to date. I mperial B ank or P eesia. Mr. A. B. Hutchison continued to hold charge of the Bandar Abbas branch of the Bank throughout 1924. During the year the Bank at the request and on behalf of the Persian Gov ernment have been accepting light weight and mutilated krans at par and for warding them to Tehran to be re-minted. This, it is expected, will gradually rid the district of bad Persian silver coins. As far as can be inferred and in view of the coftsiderable increase of both the Import and Export trade, the operations of the Bank's branch here have been satisfactory and it has more than paid its working expenses.V 24 The following figures in regard to exchange transactions at Bandar Abbas during the year have been furnished by the local Manager. According to Mr. Hutchison's report the volume of business done in rupees during 1924 was considerably greater than in the preceding year. Hormuz Island. —The mines here, as usual, were worked by the same Conces- sionnaire Haji Muin-ut-Tujjar but Messrs. Frank Strick &amp; Co. of London have the first call on the mined product and in virtue of an agreement with the aforesaid Concessionnaire enjoy a monopoly for shipments of Oxiid'e to Europe. The export of Red Oxide from the Island during the year amounted to 6000 tons of which 4150 tons went to the United Kingdom, 900 tons to Philadelphia, 750 tons to India and 200 tons to Hongkong. ^ All the above shipments were on account of Messrs. Frank Strick &amp; Co., with the exception of the last consignment of 200 tons wliich was for Agha Mahomed Nemazi at Hongkong. Bandar Abb as. —There was a decided improvement in trade during 1923- 1924, the latest year for which statistics from the Customs Department are available. Both Imports and Exports showed an appreciable increase over those for the two preceding years. The total volume of trade amounted to £1,897,000 roundly of which the imports included £1,420,000 and Exports £477,000. Bandar Abbas, however is only the port of entry for merchandise and acts ps a clearing and forwarding station for places in the interior of Southern and South-Eastern Persia. A very small quantity of the goods imported are taken up for local con sumption. The roads from Bandar Abbas to Kerman, the main avenue of the trade of this district, were fairly safe during the year. It would appear from the figures in regard to imports and exports referred to above and which show a very material increase over those for the preceding- year, that the Duzdap route in spite of the advantage of having railway com munications with India is not gaining very much ground in the direction of securing the monopoly of the trade with South-East Persia. In the opinion of the Branch Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia the merchants of Bandar Abbas are now trading on a more normal basis and appear to have done a fairly prosperous business. There were no failures during the year. Imports. —India occupies the first position in the table of countries export ing goods to Persia through Bandar Abbas, and the United Kingdom comes next, the imports during 1923-24 amounting to £796,000 and £279,000 respec tively. The principal imports from India are coal, specie, piece-goods, yarn, dyes, rice, flour, tea and coffee, provisions and condiments, those from the United Kingdom consisting chiefly of Cotton piece-goods, Yarn and Twist from Manchester. % A fair proportion 'of the quantity of piece-goods shown as having been importpd from India were really of British . manufacture and had been re exported. Highest sterling rate Lowest sterling rate Average sterling rate Krans 47-| per £1 Krans 40^ per £1 Krans 43 per £1 Highest rupee selling rate .. Lowest rupee selling rate .. Average rupee selling rate . .• Krans 336 for Rs. 100 Krans 298 for Rs. 100 Krans 310 for Rs. 100 B ed O xide of I eon. T eade and C ommeroe,25 The other important items of import into this district are loaf sugar from Belgium, France and Egypt, granular sugar from Java, Twist and Yarn from Japan and dyes of German origin. Exports. —The principal exports are Carpets, raw cotton, wool, specie, almonds, pistachio nuts, raisins and other dried fruits, dates, ghee, asafoetida, oTims and Red Oxide of Iron. Carpets are chiefly of Kerman manufacture and are exported to the United States, India and the United Kingdom. All the raw cotton goes to India which also takes up the bulk of the dried fruits, dates, asafoetida and gums shipped from this district. Favourable markets are found at places on the Oman Coast for native produce especially ghee, dates and dried fruits. The value of exports to Oman was £67,875. Shipping. —163 steam ships with a total tonnage of 347,500 entered and cleared at this port during the year ; all with the exception of five vessels were under the British Flag. The British India Steam Navigation Company Ltd., maintained its weekly service from Bombay and Basra respectively, and Messrs. Frank Strick &amp; Co., sent one or two ships every month with cargo either direct from London or via Antwerp. In March the German ' Hansa ' Line of steamers inaugurated a regular bi-monthly service from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf. The S.S. ' Hohenfels ' arrived here on the 10th April and four other vessels called during the remainder of the year bringing cargo. It is believed that the 4 Hansa ' Line are running in co-operation with Frank Strick &amp; Co., and that the same fixed freight rates are being maintained by both these companies. Ling ah. —The volume of trade at this port fell appreciably from £393,200 in 1922-1923 to £288,702 during the year under review. Imports. —Imports showed a decrease of £100,000 during 1923-1924 due mainly to a big drop in the value of merchandise received from India. The lines adversely affected were principally rice, sugar and piece-goods. Crockery, cutlery, glassware and lamps of German manufacture find much favour in the local bazaars and owing to their cheapness have completely but down the sale of similar commodities from Japan with which the market was heavily stocked during the Great-War. Exports— exports during the same year declined to the extent of £4.000 attributable to the poor market for pearls that obtained abroad. Shipping. —86 vessels, 84 British and 2 German with an aggregate tonnage of 166,195 entered and cleared during the year. The subsidiary mail service in the Gulf of the British India Company continued to call weekly on the up trip and fortnightly on the down trip. Sailing Craft.—IS boats were built on the local yards during 1924 the majority being ear-marked for Dubai. The entire pearling fleet at Lingah comprises 25 or 30 boats. Three casualties were reported, being dhows laden with dates and firewood. Two were wrecked and one vessel sank whilst on her way to Koweit. Meteorological. Bandar Ahhas—The heat throughout the months of June, July, August and September was oppressively intense especially during July when the thermometer registered 110° F. in the shade on several occasions. The Summer exodus was very marked and the town practically deserted by the end of June. „ ' Rain fell between the 17th and 24th January but there was no more rain till the 19th of December when with slight intermissions it poured mcessently till the 27th of the month. It is estimated that 10 or 12 inches of ram fell during the above period, which is a record for the previous five years. Le390FD26 Earthquake Shocks. —Three very slight shocks were felt during the year. Lingah. —Here too it was abnormally hot. The Summer began early and lasted long. Rain was badly needed during the greater part of the year. There was an unprecedented heavy downpour in December which did a considerable amount of damage. P olitical S ituation. The policy pursued by His Majesty's Consulate continued to be one of helpful and friendly sympathy towards the weak administration obtaining in this district as also towards the miserable population committed to its care. This, combined with a strict neutrality and non-interference with the internal affairs concerning the governing and governed has assisted considerably in maintaining harmonious relations with both. The attitude towards politics of ' the man in the street ' met with in this district, is one of stolid indifference, a few of the younger generation of officials educated in Tehran alone being interested therein. -^bout a month prior to the Nauroz (March 2lst) the Governor Salar i- Nizam, under instructions it is believed from Reza Khan and the Minister of the Interior, attempted to incite a feeling of hatred and enmity against the Shah and the Kajar family and raise locally the popular cry prevailing in many othei 1 eountl T for a change of the existing form of Government in Persia. His^ efforts met with little if any success and a telegram signed by all the ad- ministrative officials and a few of the principal merchants was despatched to the Capital merely to fall in with the popular demand of their fellow countrv- men m other parts. . Nothing materialised to the sad. disappointment of the nationalistic minority and all talk of a Republic then a favourite topic of conversation at the M( ?S 1SS 7 eS liel(i by the Governor an(i at meetings in the house of other officials, suddenly ceased and the movement, if it can be called one in the proper sense at least as far as the Bandar Abbas district was concerned, soon fizzled out. The abrogation of the Caliphate and the expulsion from Ottoman soil of the reigning Caliph failed to raise the least excitement locally. Events following the regrettable incident m Tehran in July in which th* American Consul lost his life necessitating the imposition of martial law did not nnd their counter part in this quarter of the Shah's Dominions. . Owing to lack of communications and of a local press and in view of the strict censorship of telegrams enforced at the time, details of the detestable crime were very late in reaching Bandar Abbas. The principal merchants were absent recessing in the neighbouring hills and the poorer classes pre-occupied in harvesting the date crops at Minab and the surrounding villages. This town was in fact practically deserted. The sense of national pride that pervaded the hearts of certain of the younger inhabitants especiallv at Lingah when the newly fledged Persian Army came into being m the Gulf Ports has long since waned and the Cossack is now a by-word of contempt in these parts. Q uarantine and M edical. Bandar —Assistant Surgeon D. L. Mackay, I.M.D., held the post o Quarantine Medical Officer of the port throughout the year and remained in charge of the Consulate Dispensary and of the Charitable Dispensary estab lished m the town. This officer performed his duties in a highly satisfactory maimer and the energetic and effective measures adopted by him to eliminate plague imported into the town from Kishm Island call for special mention in this report. Prevailing Diseases : —Those most prevalent during the year were. Malaria, iseases of the Eye, Diseases of the Digestive System, Respiratory diseases, Diseases of the skin and Dysentry.T]i&lt;3St3 groups of •diseases are tabulated below for comparison with the previous year :— 1923. 1924. Malaria ,, 1043 893 Diseases of the Eye .. 515 520 Respiratory Diseases .. 381 369 Diseases of Digestive System 660 836 Diseases of the Skin .. 204 199 Dysentry 73 97 Diseases of the Digestive System and Dysentry show an increase. Malaria a decrease. The other groups show no appreciable difference. Deoths.-^-No deaths occurred in the Charitable Dispensary during the year. Attendance of patients. —The attendance of patients at the Dispensary as compared with the two previous years is as under :■—- 1^22. Total Out-door patients treated ,, ... 4526 1923. Total Out-door patients treated . 4452 1924. Total Out-door patients treated .. 4419 The above figures show that the attendance at the dispensary continues to 'be good. The attendance fell bff during the hot weather, and may be accounted for by the inhabitants leaving the town for various inland villages where a water supply was available, and where labour could be obtained during the date season. A considerable number of patients came in for treatment from surrounding villages, and a fair number from caravans arriving in the cold season, u i' ■ : |M; h Dispensary BuiMings.- —Tlie Dispensary building- is in a good -condition. No money from funds was expended during the year. The floor of the operation room was repaired and the expense met by TIaji Sheikh Ahmed Oelladary, a local merchant. A well was built in the compound of the dispensary which supplied a great need, the expense in this case being met by Haji Mukhtar Divani another local merchant. The latter is erecting at his own expense ten small cubicles for the purpose of accommodating poor persons coming in from distant villages for treatment at the dispensary. When completed the cubicles will be of great convenience to the^ poor. The furniture and fittings with the Medical and Surgical equipment are in a service able condition. Epidemics. —An epidemic of plague broke out in the month of May- Mortality amongst rats were first noticed in the middle of April. Fortunately the epidemic did not take on a violent form. In all thirteen cases occurred resulting in seven deaths. Of tire 13 cases 8 came under treatment in the Ouarantine Station and the plague huts which were erected outside the town Untreated . ..Cases 5 .. Deaths 5 Treated ,, Cases 8 .. Deaths 2 Total . Cases 13 .. Deaths 7 The epidemic seems to have first made its appearance at the ports of Dubai and Bahrain and from thence spread. The Island of Kishm became infected and it was reported that something like 400 deaths occurred there in the course of two months. All the cases that occurred in the station of Bandar Abbas were persons who had been long residents. Anti-Plague Inoculations. —On the outbreak amongst tho rats, Anti-Plague Taccine was obtained from the Par el Laboratory and inoculations freely carried out. 1888 persons were inoculated of whom only 67 were done at Kishm as the inhabitants of that place refused to submit to inoculation. It is satisfactory to observe that no case of plague occurred amongst persons inoculated at Bandar Abbas and from a statement of a Kishm merchant rf the 67 cases inoculated there, only one developed plague three days after iuoculation oid died ; all the others escaped attack.28 Small-pox. —A few cases of sporadic small-pox occurred in the town. Eeports were received that the disease was very prevalent in the outlying villages. 930 persons were vaccinated against 523 in the previous year. A large percentage of the cases vaccinated were persons from outlying villages where, according to their reports, small-pox was rife. Medico-Legal Cases. —Nil. Post Mortems. —Nil. Operations. —The number of operations performed in the dispensary during the year compared with the two previous years is as follows :—• 1922. Cases .. .. .. .. 195 3923. Cases .. .. .. 246 1924. Cases _ .. 186 Host of these may be classed as minor operations and were as follows Incisions for drainage of superficial and deep abscesses. Reduction of fractures and dislocations. Excision of tumors, Extraction of cataracts in the capsule. Iridectomies, Dental extractions for caries. All cases operated on recovered. Sanitation of Town. —The sanitation of the town is very bad. No sanita tion is practised by the inhabitants. The Municipality makes a poor attempt to keep the streets and alley ways clean. These are usually found to be dump pits for rubbish and refuse. Dilapidated houses and huts are used as public latrines. All matters and advice given as to the dangers of these conditions receive no attention. It is wondered that epidemics of Cholera do not occur. Cause of Prevalence of Malaria. —The practice of storing water in open cisterns and earthenware vessels furnish all that is necessary for breeding mosquitoes. Most of the houses are provided with these and shallow wells. The water is seldom or never changed. Mosquitoes, can more or less always be found throughout the year. Malaria gives the highest percentage of the diseases treated. Lingah. —The duties of Quarantine Medical Officer were performed by Assistant Surgeon S. G. Jackson from the 1st January to the 24th April r succeeded by Assistant Surgeon E. M. Cuzen who remained in charge, till his proceeding on leave on the 8th June. Assistant Surgeon E. T. Gfarthwaite then held charge up to the 10th November when Assistant Surgeon Cuzen resumed charge and held the appointment for the remainder of the year. Considerable help i-s extended to the Quarantine Department by the Pireetor of Customs by employing his staff to assist in preventing boats arriv ing from plague infected Islands landing passengers surreptitiously along the coast. The Quarantine Medical Officer reports the inconvenience arising from irregular payment of the salaries of his establishment who owing to sanction from Tehran being necessary for the disbursement of their salaries, sometimes, remain unpaid for six months at a stretch. The Quarantine building is reported to be in an unsatisfactory condition and with the exception of one room is virtually a heap of debris, owing to damage done by rain. Dispensary. —This continues to be in a small and unsuitable building. The attendance during the year under report was 1857 as compared with 2303 in the preceding yean The prevailing diseases were digestive troubles and ulcers*. The figures for attendance are as follows :— Men ... _ ... 1,404 Women ... 216 Children (Male) .. TJ3 Children (Female| ... 64 Total .. 1,857 The proportion of women who attend is very small and is attributable to the fact of there being no facilities for proper privacy at this institution,.29 E conomic C onditions. Bandar Abbas,—The masonry cisterns constructed all round the town for collecting drinking water for the use of the population and the wells in the vicinity were practically dry owing to the absence of rain during the greater part of the year. The scarcity of water caused much hardship and distress during the Summer months to the poor and brought about an unusually big exit from the town to the hills and to Minab, Isin and other places. The failure of crops in the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas necessitated the introduction of cereals and food-stuffs for the inhabitants and fodder for animals from other districts. There was a rise in prices in consequence. Lingah. —Conditions similar to those existing at Bandar Abbas obtained here during the year. The market was dull owing to the drop in the prices of pearls. A comparative table is appended showing the average prices in Bandar Abbas and Lingah during the years 1922, 1923 and 1924.

D. Gr. Law, I.G.S., on the 24th September. Mr. Law continued in charge till the end of the year. Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim held the appointment of Extra Assistant Resi dent, Kerman/ throughout the year. From 24th October, however, his designa tion was allered to that of ^ Indian Attache to H. B. M.'s Consul, Kerman. 2. Consulate ivork. —The total number of cases settled by the Karguzari in conjunction with the Consulate in which the interests of Foreign subjects under the Consulate protection were concerned was 25, and the compensation recovered amounted to Krans 19,885. 9 cases were pending at the end of the year. No criminal cases were instituted or disposed of during the year. 52 Biitish subjects were registered during the year 1924. 3. Indo-European Telegraph Department.—Mr. J. Hamilton remained in charge as Superintendent of the Kerman office throughout the year. At present the staff consists of 5 European and 10 Armenian Telegraphists. Mr. J. C. Smith, remained in charge of the section Kerman Sub-Division till the end of September when he was relieved by Mr. R. Ellis, Assistant Superintendent, Dehaneh Baghi. Mr. J. P. May was posted to Dehaneh Baghi, vice Mr. Ellis. Mr. P. E. Dormer, remained in charge of the section Southern Sub-Division throughout the year. No new offices were opened nor any offices closed in the Province throughout the year. The Telegraph offices at Bam, Baft and Sirjan are run by Armenian Signallers. '4. Imperial Bank of Persia. —Mr. C. A. Gardner was Manager of the Bank until 25th March when Mr. F. Gr. T. Nelson took over charge. Mr. P. W. Douglas was Accountant throughout the year. 5. British and British-protected Firms. —The following is the list of British and British-protected Firms working in Kerman :— (i) The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Ltd. (ii) Messrs. Mohamed Ali and Bros. (m) Messrs. Bardwil Bros. (iv) Messrs. B. Kazanjlan and Co. (v) Messrs. Costikyan and Co. (vi) Messrs. A. and M. Karagheusian and Co. (vii) The Wetli Co., Ltd. (vUi) Messrs. H. S. Tavshanjian and Co. (ix) Messrs- Telfeyan and Co. (x) Messrs. Atiyeh Bros. The total value of carpets exported by these Firms during the year was approxi mately as follows :— Krans. Kerman carpets and rugs . • • • Tribal rugs 450,000 Total .. 7,450,000 Early in the vear the Governor-General, Sardar Mau'zam, suddenly introduced hv proclamation a set of rules for the improvement of industrial conditions in the carpet trade—which as a matter of fact are very much bet. ^ tS they used to be. They involved among other things shorter working hours, more holidays (on full pay), segregation of male workers better accommodation, etc. This unexpected annmmcement c al ;sed l flu the commercial dove-cots. Representations were made to ^ Consulate by the firms concerned in the carpet business regarding the injury to their m.eiests whT4Tese rtde^ seemed to them to threaten to the Consul and the Governor-General some trifling modifications were agreed to -i • -i 4ii + i-»nrfip&lt;5 Shibseouentlv however the proclamation which were acceptable to both parties. fHioscqucut^v 1 K f was cancelled by order from Tehran on account ofprotestsitis said, from the master-weavers. Nothing more has been beard ot the matter.32 Par see Early in the year Captain Bumboat, a Parsee, e;r-meinber of the I. M. S., spent a fortnight in Kerman studying industries. Three other Indian Parsees from Yezd visited the town shortly after with the object of investigating the possibilities of engineering and irrigation schemes. Nothing has so far come of these missions. (The present position and future prospects of British trade will be discussed in the Trade Report). 6. Church Missionary Society and its work. —The work of the C. M. S. in Kerman consists of (^) Educational, and (h) Medical and welfare work. The Rev. A. K. Boyland, returned from leave at the end of May and took over charge of the educational work from Mr. H. E. Biggs. There is a boys* school which teaches English, Persian and Arabic to about 55 boys. The girls' schools, where English and Arabic are taught and Persian embroidery, is, in charge of Miss M. J. Stuart. A hygiene lecture is given once a month by welfare workers, specially on the care of babies. The girls' school has over come the opposition which it had to face when it opened in December 1921 ; and in three years the numbers have risen from 18 to 102 including 12 little boys. Great interest is taken in the hygiene lectures and these would do even more good if parents would only leave the girls longer in the school. But they are taken away all too soon either to get married or to earn their own living. The medical side of the Mission was in charge of Dr. C. M. Schaffter, till the end of May when he left for Yezd. Dr. Gr. E. Dodson, then took over the men's hospital and Dr. (Miss) Mary Price the women's hospital ; Miss E. 0. H. Stratton, remained in charge of the town welfare work. Miss E. J. Petley, and Miss E. M. M. Seagrave, assisted as nurses. The beds in both hospitals were ill constant demand throughout the year, patients coming from a radius of 100 miles ; while a certain amount of the medical work of Kerman and Bam has been performed by three former assistants of the men's hospital in Kerman. Dr. Dodson, reports that the health of the carpet weavers, who work in the main industry in the town, while still leaving much to be desired is distinctly! less bad than it was 15 or 20 years ago. The work of the medical mission is rapidly on the increase. In 1924 there was 565 in-patients and 540 major operations compared with 447 and 201 respectively in 1923, while 2,144 women out-patients attended the women's hospital as against 86 in the previous year. Visits to the patients' houses show a similar increase. In the words of Miss Stratton, the principal object of the welfare work is 4 ' to get in touch with deformed carpet weavers 4 so that expectant mothers may be taken to hospital to receive the medical attention they so sorely need.' In all 59 confinement cases were undertaken during the year—mostly Moham medans. Work on the new hospital was carried on steadily, and it is hoped that the new building will be completed by next year when it will be capable of accommodating 70 to 80 in-patients. 7. Political Interests of the Consulate. —The European community in Iverman is about 30 in number. Of these roughly one-third belong to the C.M.S. one-third to the I, E. T. D. ; and between them, the Bank, business community and Consulate make up the remaining third. To look after their interests is the chief business of H. B. M.'s Consul here. Politically it is his task to expound—and practice—the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Persia which remains one of friendly sympathy coupled with resolute non intervention in affairs which Persia must manage herself. To do this is not so easy as it sounds, for several reasons. To begin with Kerman is so habituated to the historic diplomatic rivalry between Britain and Russia, that almost every question is liable to be given a pro-British or a pro-Russian complexion. The activities of the present Soviet Consul—which are dealt with later—encourage this tendencv. The one question always uppermost in the minds of the leading officials .and non-officials in Kerman is whether Reza Khan is at any particular moment pro-Russian or anti-Russian. And these terms are held by all to be synonymous with anti-British and pro-British. The solution of every big ques tion is believed to hinge on whether British or Russian influence is paramount in Tehran. And in every local intrigue in which the Soviet Consul takes a hand, the British Consul in spite of himself is too often credited with a desire to uoik in the same way on the other side. Thus when the Soviet Consul was adver tising the merits of the Sinclair Oil Concession, His Majesty's Consul was approached by the Governor-General with an offer to work up demonstrations against it and in favour of a British concession.33 In the second place most of the officials have a firm belief that if His Majesty's Legation only chooses to exert its influence it can do much for its friends ; and those who so describe themselves never give up the hope that the Legation will do so.^ When they find themselves harassed by local intrigue and know that the Soviet Consul is working against them, it is perhaps natural for tliem to turn to the British Consulate. And the Governor-General did this—* as well as the Karguzer and Rais-i-Maliyeh—more than once ; asking for gome assurance of British support against their enemies. On such occasions non-intervention is a thankless task : and is hard to explain to our staunch supporters who find it equally hard to understand. One friendly 4 die-hard 1 of the old school voiced a common opinion when he said to me once with a smile : ' your Government may talk about non interference, but 1 am perfectly sure it is interfering ; only you are doing so now in a more secret way ! f) By that, however, he really meant that the British Legation has influence in Tehran, and uses it in matters of large policy. It is realized that our non interference in the purely internal and domestic affairs of Persia is a reality and is going to be adhered to. Perhaps it is even dawning on them that it is all for the best in what—for them—-is not the best of all possible worlds. Our friends are quick enough to express their resentment at the influence of the Soviet Consulate in their Jocal affairs ; and it is an obvious answer to those who ask us to use our influence on the other side that they are inviting us to do the very thing they deprecate : that to have one party playing that game is bad enough, but if we joined in it it would make confusion worse confounded. As for onr ' enemies,' the policy certainly has borne good fruit. The situation is enormously improved as compared with a year ago. They may not love us ; but they no longer suspect us. They are, by now, fairly convinced we have no subtle, ulterior motive which will be harmful to the country. Open abuse of the English in the Press and on the platform—so common a year or two a go—is a thing of the past Even veiled antipathy is dying ouL As we leave them alone, they are content now to leave us alone. Everything of courts is decided ultimately by the attitude of Tehran. But if that continues favour able, and if we can only get to grips with them, the day of good understanding with the local 44 Extremists ' is perhaps not so far off now. 8. Communications.—There was a remarkable freedom from highway robbery during the vear. Early in March a caravan of 16 donkeys laden with, rice ghee and carpets was attacked by Baluchis on the Kerman-Bam road, and everything was carried away. In autumn a number of sheep were stolen on the Kerman-Bam road, and a small caravan was attacked on the Kerman-Yezd road. But in this case the stolen goods were recovered. The Duzdab -Kerman road remained open throughout the year and no robbery took place. The Amniveh department early this year posted 20 mounted camelmen on the Kerman-Pahreh section of this road. There are also 12 Ammyeh guard^ paid from Kerman, on the Fahre-Dnzdab section, an attempt on the partof the Military to post 50 more camel sowars for guarding the desert between Shurgaz and Sipi mountains fell through. The condition of the so-called ' road ' from Duzdab to Bam which however is nevertheless an essential link of connection between Kerman and India and which 1 think the leading officials of Kerman are determined to maintain if possible, received such serious damage from torrentialrams mpecemW at the date of writing it is no longer possihie for motor ^ Figures of the trade carried along this road and a discussion of its commercial value will appear in the Trade Eeport. The postal service between Duzdab and Kerman was excellent throughou the iar. 1 Letted come punctually in 6 days from tTIate' Even in the most stormy weather this winter the post was » fotVeeks The parcel post is not so satisfactory parcels being he d ^p somctimes for weeks in Duzdab : presumably owing to delays in getting through cus o . B.—L ocal G overnment and P olitics, Governor-General. 9. Local Officials.— Govemor-Generah—^h^ German Mua^zam, of whom an account was given m the 1 t y P Lc390FD34 f ijl^ for Tehran to take a seat in tlie Medjliss, on the 6th April. Naib-Sarhang jti» llS ' 3e Mohamed Khan, Officer Gommanding* Troops in Kerman, officiated as Governor- ;|fi 11181 General till 2nd Jnne when Nizam-ud-Danleh arrived from Tehran and vook jiicd over charge. Nizam-ud-Dauleh remained in office throughout the year. Like Sardar Mua^zam, His Excellency Nizam-ud-Dauleh is decidedly anti- Bolshevik and his attitude towards this Consulate has been friendly and snlcere. ^ In personal relations he is sociable, pl easan t and courteous. But as Governor- t^on d-eneral he is handicapped in two directions. In the first place he lacks the p ; C certainty of firm support from Tehran. In the second, perhaps because he lacks that support, he has not shown sufficient, strength of character. If he does take up a strong line he is easily frightened out of it. He started off by having to face the opposition of the Officer Commanding the troops who officiated as Governor-General and who throughout the year thought more of strengthening his own than the Governor-General's position. My predecessor has recorded ki his 'Diary several instances showing the reduced power of the Governor- General in these days. On one occasion His Excellency had to apologize to the Adlieh for beating a servant who had quarrelled with one of the Malieh staff. On an other, when he endeavoured to take summary action against a confectioner who had infringed a local Municipal regulation, a number of shopkeepers immediately proceeded to send telegrams to Tehran, and the Governor-General had to climb down. Nominally responsible for law and order, actually he has no authority over the Military, or Amnieh and next to none over the Nazmieh (Police). He endeavoured to strengthen his position by forming an alliance with the Rais-i-Malieli and the Karguzar in the cause of good order, as against the democrats led by Dargahi and Rafii who constantly endeavoured to stir up mischief. But it is quite Certain that he would never have been able to secure deportation of these two men in the autumn without the concurrence of the Kais-i-Qushuh. These incidents and his opposition to the Rais-i-Nazmieh brought Nizam-ud-Dauleh towards the end of the year into conQict with the Soviet Consul ; and a mysterious incident in which the latter's ' interpreter was attacked at night by some men dressed as soldiers, as a result of which the Soviet Consul endeavoured to get a public apology from the Governor-General, still further embittered their relations. The Kais-i-Qushun who was then on intimate terms with the Soviet Consul was generally supposed to be intriguing with the latter for the recall of Nizam-ud-Dauleh ; the ' democrat ' party were against him ; his former ally the Eais-irMalieh was recalled ; rumours were current that he himself would shortly be removed. At the close of the year Ms position was undoubtedly very weak. On the other hand, there are a large number of people, both among the official classes and among Muitahids and others who sympathise with the Governor-General's; policv and who would rally round him 1 should his position with regard to Tehran become less ambiguous. And while he is not a strong Governor, he has stuck to his principles staunchly enough. He makes no secret of his belief that his countrv has more to get from friendship with Britain than Russni ; and in Muharram during the period of tension which followed the death oi Major Imbrie, he used his infiuenee effectually to prevent any disturbances. Financial Department. —Mirza Ali Naqi Begleri was Rais-i-Malieh through out the vear. Before the year ended he was under orders of recall on a charge of corruption. He was a pleasant man, friendly to this Consulate ; but lue intrigues of his own and the Governor-General's enemies Were too much tor him. He had incurred the displeasure of the ' democrats '—those lovers of intrigue and disorder—by throwing some of them out of his department. Ihd result was a systematic attack which brought down on him a commission of investiga tion headed bv a politician of extremist views, Kamal-u'l-m izareh. It is generady supposed that Mirza Ali Naqi Khan had exposed himself to charges of ^o«8 corruption in regard to the collection of opmm revenues. He himself attubuted his recall to Russian intrigue and the enmity of the democrats and other pro- Russian politicians. Though he disclaimed any intention to inlx in pontics, the intrigue of the democrats and the Soviet Consulate made it almost impossibl at that time for any official to be neutral. From their^point of view he ms regarded as being in the enemy's camp ; and his downfall was a cause ot satis- faction to them and of disheartenment to the Governcr-Gener al. Kurffuzar.—M'asi ' ? zil-i-Azam remained Karguzar during thd 5 rear - 1 4° not find myself in complete accord with Colonel Ha worth's estimate of this official. To my mind he seems to be unusually ■independent, to have ^ souna judgment and to be fair minded. He was dragged willy-nilly m o 16 P ^ , camp of the Governor-General in the same way as the Revenue the intrigues of the opposition. But since the Revenue Agent s recall Mua Z1 &lt;1 i-Azam has stood out of politics entirely and keeps himself strictly to himself.35 A pleasant man socially lie is also easy to work with officially; as a result, the relations between this Consulate and the Karguzari haxfe been most smooth, and the many cases that arise here have been satisfactorily adjusted. Police Department. —Sultan Allah Yar Khan, Officer Commanding the Ar tillery in Kerman, officiated in charge of the Police Department till 23rd July when Yawar Mahmud Khan ' Nauzari ' arrived from Tehran and took over charge. Ill recording, early in the year, that the Muavin-i-Nazmieh had been recalled to Tehran, Colonel Ha worth observed that the police force was in a very bad way and an official of a new type was needed to put it in order. Mahmud Khan * Kauzari ' who managed to retain his position against all attacks till the end of the year, is certainly an official of the new type. He is the man who com- loanded the Khurrasan Brigade after the death of Mohamed Taqi Khan in Meshed in 1921 and he officiated as Grovernor-General of Khurrasan for a time. Since he came to Kerman, he has been a source of trouble of one kind or another. He has quarrelled with the Eais-i-Qushun ; and defied the (xovernor-Oeneral. He poses as a patriot but in reality seeks nothing but personal power, his brief taste of which in Khurrasan has merely whetted his appetite. He is essentially not a man of peace; as such he has made a natural alliance with the Soviet Consul here, and has proved a thorn in the flesh of the Governor-General from the day he arrived. At the same time he seems to want to be on good terms with this Consulate. He is a curious problem. He gives the appearance of not quite knowing his own mind. A turbulent man, he has at present too many enemies here to be able to do much harm; the Governor-General wants a quiet life and the Eais-i-Qushun does not want a rival ; ' Nauzari's ' position there fore is insecure. In his own department he is probably efficient and he is cer- tainly a disciplinarian. yidJieh. —The Department of Adlieh passed through considerable vicissi tudes during the year. In March, in accordance with instructions from Tehran* the department suspended work altogether and a separate ^ department of in vestigation ' was formed by the Governor-General to attend to the complaints, etc., filed in his office. Early in April Mirza Abdul Rahim Khan, the Ilais-i- Adlieh, was recalled to Tehran. By the end of the month however Tehran had changed its mind and orders were received to open the Adlieh in Kerman- Mirza Ahdal llahim Khan who had then got as far as Yezd turned round and came back again. He remained in charge till the end of the year. A suggestion which he made to the Central Government that his department should open branches in the districts of Eafsinjan, Sirjan and Bam elicited the reply that this question would be considered after a departmental examina tion of all Adlieh employees had been held by an officer who was shortly leaving Tehran for the purpose. So far as is known this officer never materialized and the departmental examination has never been held. Mirza Abdul Rahim Khan is a courteous and friendly gentleman of the old school, who for the most part keeps out of politics. Telegraph Mukhatib-us-Sultan, Bais-i-Telegraph, was in charge of this department both at the beginning and at the end of the year. In his Diary for the week ended 20th January Colonel Haworth mentioned that this official had been ' finally dismissed '. But Mukhatib-us-Sultan has the power of the Phoenix. By the end of March he was still in Kerman, though not in charge of the department, anxiously awaiting the Governor-General's de parture and hoping to be able to work his reinstatement as soon as Sardar Mua'zam left Kerman. In this he was successful. By the end of April he was reinstated and though he has since tottered more than once he is there still. His intrigues and disloyalty to the Governor-General towards the end of the year caused His Excellency to send to the telegraph office for despatch to Tehran an ' en clair ' telegram recommending his possitively final dismissal. A reconciliation was, however, patched up. Socially, Mukhatib-us-Sultan is exceedingly good company. But he is an inveterate intriguer, and quite unreliable. Municipality Municipality in Kerman has led a chequered existence. Karly in the year Sardar Mua'zam'attempted to form a municipality on proper lines, principally for the purpose of cleaning and lighting the town. It was decided that the revenue department should subscribe 300 Tumans from the' Navaqil but nothing had been done when he left. In July Nizam-ud-Dauleh made another attempt to organize this so-called department and have a com mittee and president appointed by election. This too failed; and Agha Mehdi r a Kermani and local champion of the ' democrats ' was left in possession of the field. A t one time he flirted with the Soviet Consul; and he certainly never used his influence on the side of the Governor-General He had no relations with the British Consulate. IJealth Officer. —In the course of the year Dr. Musa Khan, a physician with French Cjiialiflcations and English experience, who had come to Kerman with Sardar Mua'zam and was in charge of the Nurieh hospital (a Waqf institu tion) as well as ex-offieio Health Officer for the town, resigned and left Kerman as he was unable to obtain either his pay or medicines from the Mutawalli in charge of the hospital funds. Dr. Musa Khan was a man who took keen interest in his work. He had written a comprehensive report on the serious state of public healtjh in Kerman town owing to the appalling extent of syphilis and of opium poisoning; but nothing had come of his efforts to get some practical measures introduced in Kerman to combat the opium evil. Nor could he obtain much support from the officials of this place with regard to his claim against the .Mutawalli. He left Kerman in disgust in October; and the post has not sines been fllled. The above is a sad record of divided counsels, mtriguey suspensions and dis missals. It is small wonder that the year has little progress to show in the matter of local administration. I have already mentioned the failure of the Governor-General's attempts to reorganize the municipality, and of the scheme for extending the administration of justice. Another plan which came to grief Avas a proposal to take in hand the scandalous mismanagement of the Waqf revenues and hand these over to an impartial committee. On the credit side may be entered the opening of registers of births and deaths: the clothing- of em ployes of various departments in proper uniforms: the formation of a Chamber of Commerce (which was to meet for the first time on the 1st January 1925) and tbe oath taken by the employes of Finance Department in the presence of all other officials that they would not rob the Government, The machine has, in fact, Just carried on with a good deal of creaking and stopping. But it is difficult for the best men to work honestly and hopefully in present conditions. Salaries are small—in many cases they have been re duced in the year—-and not punctually paid. And officials are far more busy over intrigue than over their Job. This, is inevitable so long as the tenure of their appointments is so insecure as it is at present. Everyone feel's he is at the mercy of local intrigue, backed by wire-pulling at the Capital JSTo one can rely on the support of the Government. 10. Local Politics.—Elections. —When the year opened the elections in Sirjan and Jiruft were dragging their weary course. In Bam they were still suspended. By the middle of February, they had been completed m Sirjan and Jiruft by the election of Atta-ul-Mulk for Sirjan and Sardar Nusret for Jiruft. In Ram, eventually. Amir-i-Ihtisham was elected. Attempts made in Tehran (supported by the 4 democrats ' here) to have the election declared invalid and to put in Nazim-ut-Tujjar, a notorious Anglophobe, did not sueeeed.. The Republican Movement. —Eeza Khan's, historic failure to carry through the movement in favour of a republic in the early spring was attended in Ker- inan by the usual demonstrations. Shops were closed, numerous telegrams were sent to Tehran and all classes of the people were compelled to join in the agitation. The democrats were particularly active, making separate arrange ments in a tent of their own for collecting and forwarding telegrams. The^ movement collapsed on the 1st April on receipt of orders from Reza Khan him self; and though there was a last flicker of activity, sedulously puffed into a flame by the Rais-i-Qushun a month later, it soon died out. So far as can be gathered this movement entirely lacked genuine support in Kerman or the, districts.. Murder of Major Imbrie. —This tragic event had a most disquieting effect on JCerman although it was never found necessary for Martial Law to be^ declared in the town. A feeling of nervousness seemed to spread through the place; and during the month of Muharram there was a feeling that some dis turbance might break out at any time. But the Governor-General had pro- hibited inflamatory speeches in public and nothing happened..Ardbhtan trouble.—Thar a was a great deal of talk and speculation about tMs affair while it lasted. The Russian wireless was busy with the report that ^ high officials in Kerman ' were in favour of Shaikh Khaza ' al ^ the Russian ^ Kusia ' which was circulated by the Soviet Consul contained a number of gross mis-statements of our attitude in the matter; and the satisfactory outcome of the negotiations at Ahwaz was hailed with great relief by tlie Governor- Oeneral and all moderate officials and non-officials. The Press.—The Press in Kemian has hitherto been chieiiy represented by the notorious demogague Dargahi's occasional publication 44 Nameh Farhang This paper bad teen stopped in 1923; but, although he had received no sanction lo republish, one number appeared in middle of February. A second issue appeared the 15th April in which Dargahi openly attacked Sardar Mua'zam tl'.o ex-Govemor-General in regard to his conduct of the elections. In a sub sequent number published at the end of July Dargahi, who was theia candidate for a vacancy in the Medjliss and who was being warmly supported by the Soviet Consul, issued another number in which he vented his spleen on English policy in Asia. Tbis was the last number ©f the 4 4 Nameh Farhang '' issued dur ing the year. Dargahi's dangerous intrigues had brought on him the hostility of the Ilais-i-'Quislmn as well as of the Governor-General, The Local Govern ment managed to get orders from Tehran for his deportation ; and, though this was immediately cancelled, tlie up-shot was that the Governor-General who ha;l practically tendered Ms resignation over this issue was permitted to take such action in regard to Dargahi as he considered advisable in the interests of the peace in the province. Dargahi who, thanks to the help of the head of the Police, had never been arrested, disappeared to Tehran and lias not since returned to Kerman. During the summer some moderately inclined democrats conceived the idea of re-starting the ' Bidari ' an old newspaper in Kerman. They approached H. B. M. 's Consul for assistance in the matter of money and news. Major Fowie made no promises and referred tne matter to Tehran. Towards the end of the year they had received sanction for the publication, and one or two numbers of their paper have since appeared^ The Editor of the paper, Hashimi, is a de^ uiocrat; but he lias so far kept his paper free from any objectionable political ibias. The Calcutta paper u Habl-ul-Matin '' continued to circulate regularly in Kerman. Its openly bitter tone against Britain and its mischievous lies about the Arabistan crisis in particular were the subject of much surprise and com ment on all sides. It undoubtedly caused a great deal of mischief, 11. Bmsmn Activities.'—(a) Political. —It is all too natural a transition from local politics to Russian activities in Kerman in 1924. Nothing very much happened while M. Zaslavsky remained here as .Soviet Consul, though he gave a certain amount of active support to the democrats while the agitation in favour of a republic was going on. He left Kerman at the end of July and was succeeded by M. Alexander Laktionoff who has proved himself to be a much more active propagandist. M. Laktionoff who was a former member of tie Cheka, and has been actively connected with Soviet propaganda is a man about 45—50 years of age. It is- believed that at one time he suffered imprisonment for 3 years on account of his revolutionary activities. He speaks Persian fluently, knows Turkish and has taken up the study of Urdu. Whether this last is with an object of corresponding with India is not known. It is also not known whether he has any secret channel of communication with India either through Duzdab or Bandar Abbas. But it is worth remarking that on his way from Bushire to Kerman he called on the Karguzar at Bandar Abbas, Sadeed-us- ^altanehj an official who is notoriously unfriendly towards us, M. Laktionoif, 'vyho exchanged mils both with my predecessor and myself, had no other rela tions with this Consulate during the year. He set to work immediately after his arrival to organise '' social centres '' in the Kerman town and province with, the help of local extremists such as Dargahi, Rafii and others. He instructed these people to join hands with the 'workers and try and get members elected froni the working classes, such as weavers, etc., to a Municipal committee. At the same time the process of brow- heating the Governor-General and interfering with the local officials began. By threatening the Governor-General that there would be disturbance in the town unless the latter cancelled summons he had served on two socialists in connection with a local dispute he forced the Governor-General to give way. In August, with the help of the Officer Commanding and the principal socialits, he started Lc39ayD38 propaganda in favour of the Sinclair Oil Concession, giving the matter an anti- British bias. His persistent interference in all local affairs occasionally landed him in embarrassing situations. Thus his support of the Khawanin family in their grievances regarding recruiting brought him up against the Officer Com manding; and he found it often very difficult to keep on good terms at the same time with the latter and with the Rais-l-X^zmieh. But in general his position was clear enough. He was on the side of disorder. He kept in close touch both with the so-called ' Committer of Social Democrats ' formed of the leading political extremists; and with various socialistic Societies suck as the ' Anjuman-i-Ranj'bar ' (or Association of Labourers) which he urged to make demands for higher wages from their employers. His wife meanwhile was equally industrikms teaching Russian—and propaganda—in the Par si school.. 'With the autumn, a period of intensive activity began. He tried hard to save Dargahi from being deported. He plainly took sides against the Firancial Agent when Kamai-ul-Wizareh visited Kerman and there were constant com ings and goings between the latter and M. Laktionoff. He caused news to be broadcasted by the Moscow Wireless damaging to the interests of the Governor^ Oeneral and other moderate official® ; and the G-overnor-General has absolute proof that through the Russian Legation in Tehran he mad© a determined—and very nearly successful—attempt to have His Excellency recalled. He bullied the Karguzar. And when the Pishkar-i-Malieh wag suspended, there is no doubt that most of the officials were genuinely afraid of him and his mtrigues. The Governor-General was driven to, send a bitter complaint against Ms interference in the local affairs to his Government and to expostulate personally with M. Laktionoff, It was of course useless to do so ¥ The Soviet Consul openly ad mitted to the Governor-General that as his Government's policy was revolution throughout the World, interference in the affairs of all countries was a necessary preliminary, \ Judged by Moscow standards, M. Laktionoff is possibly counted a success ful Consul. From the point of view of the best interests of the people of Ker man his intrigues, to a third party, appear to have had a purely pernicious effect. There are hornets' nests in Kerman—as in most places; and if they are poked with a stick the wasps will assuredly come forth. It seems to be the Soviet policy to disturb, and to keep on disturbing them. What Kerman wants is peace,, orderly progress, decent administration uninterfered with by outsiders. M. Laklionoff appears anxious to do his best to encourage those who are opposed to these objects. He takes sides in all disputes; and manages to give to them a sinister twist which helps to keep alive the old division into pro-British and anti-British which otherwise might die a natural death. (&amp;) Commercial activities^ —In the more legitimate sphere of fostering trade with Russia, the Soviet Consulate has been spasmodically energetic. Early in the year lists of Russian firms anxious to do trade with Persia were advertised by means of posters; and orders for piece-goods and other fabrics, hardware, lamps and agricultural machinery were solicited. In mid-summer, with a great flourish trumpets, the Russian Military Attache and an official Cotton Expert— (M. Gregorian)—arrived from Tehran, via Rafsinjan, the prinicipal cotton centre of the province, where they made enquiries about cotton production and advised the purchase of large quantities of American seed from Russians who had imported it into Persia. In Kerman they attended a big reception held at the Soviet Consulate on the 3rd July to celebrate the signing of the Russo- Persian Commercial Treaty. On this occasion they talked of the opening a branch of the Russo-Persian Bank in Kerman in the near future; and announced their readiness to advance seed and money for increased cotton growing. Neither promises has yet been fulfilled. Finally at the end of the year a large consignment of Russian oil arrived from Baku: an official Russian trade agent was appointed; and a shop labelled the ^ Russo-Persian Oil Shop ' was started for the sale of this oil. As the existing arrangements for the import and market ing of Anglo-Persian Oil Co.'s oil and petrol were of the most unsatisfactory description, supplies being inconstant and scanty; and the importers—in the absence of any agency—charging fancy prices, the conditions were ripe for the introduction of better methods. The Russian oil moreover was of good quality and was cheaper. These factors caused an immediate drop in the price, as well as in the sales, of A. P. 0. C. oil and petrol, 12. Military Affairs.^-N&amp;ih Sarhang Mohamed Khan remained in Kerman as Officer Commanding the Kerman Troops throughout the year. He is a clever young man who makes it his business to keep on good terms, at any rate outward ly, with all parties. On one or two occasions he fell out with the Soviet Consul Imt for the most part he is on fairly intimate terms with him. At the same timehf; lias kept friends with this Consulate. He is out to get as much power as lie can for himself. But he is also keen on his profession, keeps his men hard at work and up to a reasonable standard of discipline. The record of the year was a successful one from the military point of view. The expedition against ZargLam-us-Saltaneh achieved its object without loss of blood. Zargham-us- Saltaneh, after remaining in hiding for some time, was brought into Kerman by Amir-i-Shaukat, the Deputy Governor, and then made terms with the Governor- Oeneral and the Officer Commanding. He returned to Rudbar after some time, shorn of all power. Said Khan of Jiruft had also fled when the troops, about 700 in number, came his way. In his absence his property was looted and he was forced to come in and make terms as Zargham-us-Saltaneh had done. The robber Wali Mohamed Shirdil who still defied the Government at the beginning of the year came into collision with a small party of trained recruits coming trom Bam to Kerman in April. The robber lost 2 men killed and the Officer Commanding, Persian Detachment, was wounded. Shortly after this, fearing retribution, Wali Mohamed Shirdil sent a message to the Officer Com manding, Kerman, saying that he was willing to serve the Persian Government, and he promised allegiance on the Koran. He came in, was pardoned, under took to provide 2 or 3 hundred troops to the Persian Army, and was promised an official appointment if he behaved himself. Accounts were also squared (for the time being) with Mir Barkat of Beya- ban. A small column was sent against him from Rudbar early in March. This- was sufficient to bring Mir Barkat to his senses. He submitted and was granted an amnesty by the Persian Government and was ordered to pay up his revenues. Recruiting. —There was considerable activity in the matter of recruiting' in the Bam and Narmashir districts early in the year; and the army made itself distinctly unpopular in this respect. As many as 120 men were sent to Bam to beat up recruits and by April 400 or more had been recruited and trained. Many stories are told illustrative of the dislike the peasants have to enter military service. We hear of cultivators leaving their fields and deserting their homes- to avoid being caught; of men throwing themselves into wells. In some cases it is said land-owners paid fees to get their men back to the land. It was even found necessary to stop recruiting at Bam owing to the complaints which were sent to Tehran. The difficulty in getting recruits is due to two causes ; in the first place military service is much more strenuous than before when the ser vice was generally territorial and a Sarbaz could spend at least 3 or 4 months a year in his own village attending to his own land. Now the Persian regular has to work hard at drill and as the service is no longer territorial, he is liable to be sent on duty anywhere. This year, for example, 600 men were sent to 1 Shiraz after the outbreak of trouble in Arabistan. In the second place the land owners being still responsible for providing recruits in proportion to their land revenues are yet unable as a general rule to buy exemption from this duty. They are constantly being worried by the Military to furnish their quota of recruit s^ and very often have to pay the tenants to induce them to enlist—sometimes as much as Tumans 100 per head. In August a request was actually sent to this Consulate by the Imam-i-Juma on behalf of the land-owners asking for help. The Khawanin, family of rich land-owners in Kerman, also approached the Soviet Consul who sent them a favourable reply, thereby getting himself into difficul ties with the Officer Commanding. This Consulate refused to interfere in the matter. The army may be unpopular; but it has brought peace and security unknown, I suppose, for generations. 13. Jirnft, Rudbar and Persian Baluchistan. —As has already been stated Zargham-us-Saltaneh, the leading chief in Eudbar, has been broken. After his return from Kerman to Rudbar the troops were withdrawn with the exception of a small detachment who remained in Rudbar throughout the year. There is revenue due from Zargham-us-Saltaneh fixed at Tumans 55,000, and Zargham went back to try and collect this as well as to fulfil his promise of providing: 50 sowars and 50 camel-sowars for the Persian Army. Early in August the Financial Agent went to meet Zargham-us-Saltaneh and arrange for the payment of these arrears. So far however no revenue has been recovered and no recruits provided. Amir-i-Shaukat who was appointed Deputy Governor of the Khamseh in cluding Rudbar in connection with the operations against Zargham-us-Saltaneh was succeeded in August by Muzaffer-ud-Dauleh, a nephew of the present Gov- fcrnor-GeneraL40 Persian .Baluchistan. —No action was taken against Dost Mohamed of Bam- pur during the year although it had been expected that a military expedition would be sent agains. him in the autumn. The embarrassments of the Persian Oovernment in other parts of the country prevented this intention from materia lizing. Dost Mohamed was appointed Governor of Persian Baluchistan under the Governor-General of Kerman; but according to His Excellency Nizam-ud- Dauleh he will only retain his position until the Persian Government is free to subdue him. Meanwhile he has not paid a Kran of revenue though he continue^ to send abundant promises to pay. The intentions of the Persian Government in regard to Dost Mohamed appear however to be extremely nebulous. 'The Officer Commanding, Kerman, talks airily of an expedition 2,000 strong in the autumn of 1925. But it seems certain that he has no definite instructions from Tehran on the subject. CHAPTEE VI. ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE MEKRAN COAST FOR THE YEAR 1924. Personal.—Mr. E. E. Gunter, O.B.E., was in Political charge of the Mekran Coast througKout the year. Gun-runnino. —25 Magazine rifles and 23 other rifles of which 6 were Sniders and some ammunition (number of rounds not known) were landed on the coast of Persian Baluchistan during the year. Persian Baluchistan. —Mir Dost Mohamed Khan was appointed Governor of Persian Baluchistan with the title of Assad-ed-Dowleh by the Persian Government. He invited _ all the chiefs of Persian Baluchistan to Bampur to settle the collection of taxes. Some of the chiefs obeyed his orders. Dost Mohamed then went to Gaih to meet those who had not gone to Bampur.. A fight occurred between him and Mir Rustam Khan of Champ in which the latter was defeated. Dost Mohamed Khan recovered and returned to the owner who was a British Indian subject goods looted by the above chief. He sent his Munshi to Charbar with a letter to the Director in which he declared his friendship to the British Government. His agents appear to have made a vigorous effort to collect taxes in the Bahu district ; it was reported that a majority of the inhabitants of that district fled to avoid paying the taxes. The peace of the Dashtyari district was disturbed by a quarrel (in the absence of Mahmud Khan on a pilgrimage to Mecca) between Din Mohamed and the sons of Mahmud Khan. In a fight which ensued Wali Mohamed a son of Mahmud Khan was shot dead by his own followers by accident. Din Mohamed has become more powerful and has expelled Mahmud Khan's Wali from Charbar declaring the village to belong to him alone. It was reported that the whole territory of Mahmud Khan was looted by Din Mohamed's men during the quarrel. Mir Mahmud Khan on return from Mecca, left for Bampur to see Mir Dost Mohamed and to ask him to settle differences between him and Din Mohamed. In March one Seyed Alim Shah from Afghanistan left Jask for Bombay en route to Mecca. During his journey through Persian Baluchistan he is said to have circulated papers inciting the people to take arms against the British Government on behalf of Khalifa on a declaration of war. The information was communicated to the Police at Karachi and he was not allowed to proceed to his destination. In March a Persian officer and 30 men arrived at Jask. Some of them were despatched to old Jask as a. Customs patrol. Claims. —No old craims of British Indian traders against the chiefs and the people of the Persian Baluchistan were settled during the year. Foreign subjects.^-Xo subjects of any foreign European power resided at any port on the Mekran Coast during the year. Telegraph lines. —The lines between Charbar and Jask were interrupted during the year by wilful d^Hge ^s follows ^ Hours, February f , ., ,. 17 March .. .. .. ,, ,. 53 June ., , f .. ., ,. 101 July ., ,. ,,23 August ., .. .. .. .. 24 September .. .. .. .. 118 November .. .. .. .. 27 In the Karwan district the chief of which is Mir Nagcii Khan, the total period of interruption was 186 hours. The interruptions were chiefly caused by the'41 headmen whose subsidies have been transferred to Mir Nagdi Khan. He was warned to take action against the offenders. Slave traffic. 47 slaves were reported to have been sent across to the Arab coast for sale. Two slaves sought refuge in the British Agency at Gwadur during the year ; they were sent to Karachi at the^ Government expense. Subsidies.—UliQ following chiefs were in receipt of telegraph subsidies during the year :— Annual telegraph subsidy. Name of chief. Habitat. Sons. Gabd-Jask Coastal line.

Wrecks. —A Kathiawar dhow ran ashore at Charbar in February during a storm and broke up. The cargo was taken charge of by the Agent of the owners of the dhow. In March a report having been received of the plunder of a Dhofar dhow by Mir Jalal Khan of G-wetter, the Director visited the place in I. Gr. T. S. ^ Patrick Stewart ' to hold an enquiry. It appeared that the dhow was totally wrecked and that the Nakhuda gave about half of the cargo recovered to the chief of Gwetter as salvage and sold the other half in Gwetter and Gwadur. In December a Kutch dinghy sank near Eas Maidani with a cargo of 1,300 baskets of dates from Basrah. The Nakhuda and crew reached Charbar in a small boat. They left for Mandvi in another dinghy. During the year two Persian dhows were wrecked on the Mekran Coast one near Koh-i-Mubarak and other near Jagin. The wreckage and cargo was looted by local inhabitants. Tour. —The Director left Karachi for a tour of inspection on the 16th February and after visiting all Telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf returned to headquarters on the 28th March. On the up trip he interviewed Mir Din Mohamed Khan of Dashtyari at Charbar and on the down trip Mirs Hoti and Mustafa Khan.at Jask. Mr. H. D. Thoy relieved Mr. J. S. Navarra of charge of the Jask Telegraph Sub-Division on 9th April. He left on his annual inspection of the lines between Jask and Gwadur on the 24th November with a Persian escort consisting of one officer, 45 mounted infantry with a machine gun and ten machine gunners s,ent from Kerman. This is the first time that an escort has been supplied by the Persian Government. Mr. Thoy's report on the condition of the country between Biyaban and Gwadur is appended. Lc390FD'42 J ASK. Mr. W. C. Janes was in charge of the telegraph station during the year. Persian officials. —Mirza Abdul Husain, Deputy Governor, was, recalled to Bushire. He was relieved Jby Reza Khan who arrived at Jask on 26th June. Reza Khan held the post for a very short period as Salah Ihtesham was sent from Teheran'to succeed him. The latter arrived on the 16th July but soon applied for a transfer which was arranged. Since his departure, there has actually been no Deputy Governor in Jask. The duties are being carried out by the Collector of Customs. Customs—Mirm Haji is still the Collector of Customs. He appears to have been carrying on his duties satisfactorily. Military detachment. —A detachment of the 3119th Hyderabad Regiment consisting of one British Officer, 1 Indian Officer and 75 other ranks arrived on the 9th February. They relieved the detachment of the 3|15th Punjabis. Navy. —H. M. S. ' Triad R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' and R. I. M. S. ^ Elphinston ' called at Jask during the year. Murder. —In April Shahdad Gwaram, a lineguard of the Jask telegraph Sub-Division, and his, wife were shot by Murad Khan, son of Mir Mustafa Khan of Jask. The woman recovered but Sliahdad died after few days. The matter was represented to Mir Mustafa Khan who did nothing to compensate the bereav ed family. With the Political Resident's sanction his subsidy has been with held pending payment of compensation. Visit. —Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., visited the station on the 17th March. v C harbae. Mr. G-. A. Tomlinson held charge of the Telegraph Station and looked after the interests, of the British Indian traders during the year. Persian Customs. —Mr. Simon left for Bunder Abbas on transfer handing charge of his duties to Mirza Ghulam Husain Shaibani on 28th June. The Customs subsidies paid to Mirs Din Mohamed and Mahmud Khan were with held by the orders of the Central Customs Administration. Din Mohamed was much agitated over the matter and wrote several letters to the Mudir of Customs for payment of his dues. He was informed that subsidies could not be paid until sanction which was asked for, had been received from Teheran. On the 29th December it was reported that Din Mohamed who was to reach Charbar in a few days, would make the Mudir pay his dues by force. The latter asked for our protection and was informed that he would be given shelter within the Telegraph compound if emergency arose. Out of^Rs. 4,000 seized last year by the Charbar Customs from a British Indian subject under the charge of smuggling, Rs. 3,000 were returned to the owner by the orders of the Centrab Customs Administration. In May the Customs Department seized 106^ Maria Theresa dollars belong ing to a British Protected subject on the grounds of smuggling. Representa tions were made to Bunder Abbas and the dollars were handed back by the Customs Department on payment of $ne of Rs. 50. In December the Customs seized and confiscated two camel loads of piece goods belonging to a British Indian trader on the grounds that the goods were smuggled into Dashtyari from G-wadur. The Customs also demanded a fine of Rs. 200. The matter has been referred to His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bunder Abbas, Walis. —Shahdad Abbas who was dismissed by Mahmud Khan took service with Mir Din Mohamed who appointed him as his Wali, vice Sher Mohamed dis missed on 10th February. Soon after his appointment, many complaints were made against him for extorting taxes such as quarantine fees, on all persons coming to Charbar by sea, taxes on goods coming into Charbar from Dashtyari, etc. Representations were made to Mir Din Mohamed about these taxes. The chief replied that octroi duty on the goods was levied only on the Persian sub jects and that he had a right to levy it. The Director of Customs Bunder Abbas Wrote to the chief urging him to abolis.h the taxes. Shahdad Abbas who is a43 British Indian subject living in Dashtyari is said to have purchased the Wali- ship on payment of a large sum of money. Mir Din Mohamed has promised to appoint a Persian subject as soon as Shahdad's contract had expired in Feb ruary 1925. Plague.—In .March two deaths from plague occurred at Charbar. One of the victims -was a Telegraph employee. Eats were found dead in the village and in the houses of the lineguards. Prompt measures were taken ; dead rats were burnt and inmates of all suspected houses were inoculated with serum sent from India. No further cases occurred. Military detachment. —The strength of detachment stationed here was one Indian officer and 30 rifles at the end of t|&gt;e year. Aeroplanes. —The following aviators arrived at Charbar on the dates men tioned against their names and left the same date. British. Major Maclaren. 23rd April. U. S. A. H-2, 3 &amp; 4. Under Lt.

Visits. —Colonel Powell of the Western Command and Colonel Shea Com manding the Regiment finding the troops of the Gulf ports visited the station on 1st April and Mth December, respectively. grwadur. Lai Khan was British Agent at Gwadur during the year. Wali. —Seyed Saif bin Badar, on expiry of his leave returned to Gwadur in •March relieving Mulla Dad Mohamed the Qazi of Gwadur who had been acting for him. Customs. —Abdus Salam Effendi was appointed Collector of the Sultan's customs in March. The relations between the merchants and the Customs Department were good during the year. funding charges—A complaint was lodged against the Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company (Seth Mohamed Reimoo Mowji who died at Karachi in November) by the British Indian merchants to the effect that he was charging them double fees for landing their glDods from the steamer in bad weather. The matter was referred to the Political Agent, Muscat, who has drafted a landing contract approved by the Sultan's Government. This' will remove the cause of the trouble. Visits. —Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., visited Gwadur in R. I. M. S. 11 Lawrence '' on the 15th March leaving the same day for Muscat. In September Seyed Shahab, brother of the present Sultan of Muscat arrived at Gwadur and stayed for about one month and then returned to Mus,cat. E. E. GUNTER, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, In Political Charge Mekran Coast. K arachi ; 29th January 1925, Mr. H. D. Thoy's report No. 153, dated 8th January 1925, on the condition of the country between Biyaban and; Gwadur. B iyaban D istrict. Bahadur-us-Sultan Mir Burkat Khan, is still in administration of the district and has been carrying out the work quite satisfactorily. The present relations existing between Mir Burkat Khan and Mirza Khan of Rudbar are still very strained and there is a rumour that Mirza Khan intends to make another attack on Mir Burkat. Mir Burkat's relations, towards us continue to be very friendly. He visited the station this year and was received and entertained by the Assistant Superintendent Telegraph Station, J ask.44 Jask District. Mir Mustafa Khan continues to control this district assisted by his son Mir Murad Khan. Since the murder of Shahdad Gwaram lineguard by Murad Khan, Mir Mustafa Khan has ceased to have any dealings with Murad Khan and has also forbade Mm to enter his house. Murad Khan appears to be very hurt over Mir Mustafa Khan's action and has promised to pay the blood money to Mir Mustafa Khan and has also asked to be pardoned which Mir Mustafa Khan has granted. The Biyaban and J ask Districts up to Maliki Chedag has been administered satisfactorily and the tribesmen are friendly disposed towards us except the; son of Hoti who still continues to trouble us. . The Persian Government installed three Deputy Governors at Jask but their tenure of office was a short lived one—the three of them only remaining for about two months, which appears to have proved unsatisfactory. Dasht of the Bint District. This district is administered by Nagdi Khan from Maliki Chedag to Lund assisted by the sons of the late Islam Khan, Mir Yahya Khan and Mir Ayub Khan. Yahya Khan who was in receipt of the subsidy for the protection of the telegraph lines has ceased to draw it. The subsidy having been transferred to Mir Ayub Khan also the responsibility of protecting the line. Nagdi Khan is supposed to have received orders from Sirdar Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur that he was to collect the whole of the revenue for this year from Maliki Chedag to Lund and bring it personally to Gaih where Dost Mohamed was in residence. Similar orders were issued to all headmen from Lund to Parag. On arrival of Nagdi Khan and the headmen at Gaih, Dost Mohamed Khan informed them'that the yearly revenue in future was to be paid to him and nothing to Sirdar Husain Khan. During our halt at Rapch Nagdi Khan and Ayub I&amp;ian interviewed me and appeared quite friendly and voluntarily offered their services to do anything which was required by Government. The Karwan chiefs Mir Ali, Mir Hassan Bak, Mir Shahsowar and Mir Gool Mohamed also interviewed me and appeared to be quite friendly. They all seemed to be very upset on account of their sub sidy being given to Nagdi Khan. I explained to them that it was through their own fault and neglect in not protecting the line that their subsidy was stopped. Dasht of the Gaih District. From Balbund to Toz Hills is still administered by Sirdar Husain Khan. I have not had the opportunity of meeting Sirdar Husain Khan but from all* accounts heard. Sirdar Husain Khan seems very friendly disposed towards the British Government. On arrival at Bir, Mir Khair Mohamed, Mir Shahbeg and Moola Shah- abdullah interviewed me and all seemed friendly. Shahabdullah enquired about a subsidy, I informed him that I would put his request before vou. Shahabdul lah appears to be a very respectable and honest man and offered to do anything for Government. I have received no complaints of anv misbehaviour against the headmen of Bandini, Bir, Khir, Sirgan or Parag and the line through these districts has not been tampered with in any way. Gaih District. This district is more or less North and is under the control of Sirdar Husain Khan. The relations between Sirdar Hus.ain Khan and Sirdar Dost Mohamed Khan of Bampur are not at all friendly. Since Dost Mohamed Khan has taken all the revenue from the different districts and allows Husain Khan just what he tJainks is sufficient. The two Wazirs sent by Dost Mohamed Khan last year to help Husain Khan have returned to Bampur. Dashtyari District. Sirdars Mahmud Khan and Din Mohamed are the chiefs of this district and the relationship between them continues to be strained. A quarrel took place between Mir Dilawar Khan, son of Mahmud Khan and Sirdar Din Mohamed during the absence of Mahmud Khan on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Dilawar Khan shot one of his men Ahmed by name outside the Talang fort at Dashtyari as he(Dilawar) heard Ahmed intended taking his life. Bilawar then, went to the house of Jellai (Wazir of Din Mohamed) where Ahmed's wife was stopping with Jellai's wife, Jellai being away Gaih, ordered the woman out and set fire to the house. Jellai's wife wrote to Jellai at Gaih informing him of Dilawar's behaviour. Jellai arrived at Dashtyari and after about seven days s^hot Shahdost nephew of Dilawar. About four days after the death of Shahdost, Dilawar went to Jellai's house and fired at a blacksmith and his wife (servants of Jellai) killing both of them. Jellai was out at the time of servants were shot. Jellai informed Din Mdhamed who was at Gaih who imparted the news to Dost Mohamed who was also at Gaih. 400 men and a small cannon were placed at the disposal of Din Mohamed by Dost Mohamed. Din Mohamed set out to attack Dilawar who was defending the fort at Talang. Din Mohamed's men opened fire. No casualties reported on Din Mohamed's side. The fight is sup posed to have lasted for four hours and then ceased. Mir Mahmud Khan now appears on the scene, after hi^ return from his, pilgrimage. He disembarked at Gwadur and then took a dhow to Gwetter and then by camel to Dashtyari ; on his arrival at Dashtyari (Buna) he heard of all that had happened. Mahmud Khan wrote to Din Mohamed and told him if he wanted to fight to come and fight at Buna. Mahmud Khan with 200 men entered Buna fort and awaited Din Mohamed's arrival. On arrival of Din Mohamed and his men, both sides opened fire, the casualties on Din Mohamed's side were three men killed and on Mahmud Khan's side two killed and the fighting stopped. The Moolas of Dashtyari are endeavouring to make peace between Mahmud Khan and Din Mohamed and there is, every hope of peaceful negotiations being arranged. The above information was received from Charbar by telephone. Bahu District. This district is under the control of Mir Subhan and Mir Ahmed Khan. Mir Subhan and Mir Ahmed Khan have also had a quarrel on account of Mir Jelal Khan of Gwetter refusing to pay Mir Subhan his one-third share of the 'revenue from Gwetter. Mir Subhan went to Din Mohamed who was at Dasht yari and informed him of Jelal Khan's refusal to pay his third share and asked for assistance. Din Mohamed who was preparing to visit DoSit Mohamed who was at Gaih asked Mir Subhan to accompany him which he did. During Mir Subhan's absence Mir Ahmed Khan who.is not on friendly terms with Din Mohamed on hearing that Mir Subhan had gone to Din Mohamed for assistance went himself to Ibrahim Khan at Irufshan and asked for assistance to loot and destroy Mir Subhan's property. Ibrahim Khan with about 100 men accom panied by Mir Ahmed Khan arrived at Bahu and started looting and setting fire to Mir Subhan's.property. On Mir Subhan's return to Bahu he retaliated by looting and destroying Mir Ahmed Khan's property. Mir Ahmed Khan, on hearing that Mir Subhan intended to attack him, set fire to his fort. Before* the arrival of Mir Subhan, Mir Ahmed Khan is supposed to have taken all his belongings and set fire to his fort himself and proceeded to Gwetter to his brother Jelal Khan. Gekerak Durig the month of December the Jask district and Rapch had a heavy rain fall. The other districts, only having slight showers, rain is badly needed other- wise famine conditions will continue to prevail. The arms and slave traffic is till on the decrease. The general condition of the country at the time of writing is satisfactory and all the chiefs friendly disposed towards us. CHAPTER VII.

After discussion with the Provincial Director of live nT' who 1 rea 1 dll y recognized the difficulty, the Inspector was ordered to &gt; ashore and only control goods brought by Native Craft for that port.4g In May there was further trouble as Persian Craft refused to call at the 'Iraq CustomSj post. The Karguzar protested against the payment of Port dues by craft flying the Persian flag on the grounds that all Persian craft had the right of navigation in the river. The Director of 'Iraq Customs Baghdad, the Collector of Customs Basrah and His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul visited and discussed this question with the Karguzar and the Provincial Director and the two latter were informed that the question of Persian craft calling at the 'Iraq Customs post had no connection with the payment of port dues. An arrangement was arrived at whereby all craft would continue to call as before and this is working, smoothly. There was incessant rain during January as a result of which the Karun River rose several feet. The country was flooded and most of the Arab villages along the river sade were swept away and great damage was done to the crops. It was reported that there was great loss of life and enormous loss of property and live-stock. The Sheikh of Mohammerah commandeered motor launches and ballams and sent grain and food stu^s to those rendered homeles,s. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company also placed some of their River Craft at the disposal of the Sheikh for this relief work.^ The office of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consulate and other British Firms were closed on 3rd June in honour of His Majesty the King-Emperor's birthday. A reception was held at the Vice-Consulate at which the Karguzar,, Deputy Governor, Local officials and Heads of British Firms were present. On 6th June the Deputy Governor held a reception in honour of the pre sentation to the Persian Prime Minister of a photograph of Hazrat Ali from the Holy Places in 'Iraq. His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul was invited to attend. The Karguzar and other Persian officials and notables were presents No speeches were made.

Sultan Mustapha, the head of the Police Force in Arabifen, has recently arrived from Bushire and is^to reorganize the Force. He has made his headquarters at Ahwaz. There seems little doubt that great progress will be made by this Departmeent. AdliyeJi. —This Department still ceases to exist and most of the petty cases which hitherto were referred to and tried by the Head of the Police are now referred to the new Military Governor who is having a busy time with all sorts of claims dating back several years. The Military Governor stated that an Adliyeh would soon be organized in the town. BaladiyeJi. —There has been a marked improvement in this Department since the Military Occupation. The Military Governor General has appointed the Karguzar Rais-al-Baladiyeh and he in turn has appointed Agha Yousuf Abdi his Deputy' and some of the leading local merchants members of Com mittee. Far more interest is, now being taken in the sanitation of the town.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, made consi derable pi ogress with extensions, new installations and tanks during the year. Plant has been put into operation to enable a considerable increase in the pro duction of all products to be effected. A -new bench, the largest yet constructed in Abadan, was commenced in February and is hearing completion. It will deal with 1,700 tons, of crude oil per day. Twenty five 2-£ million gallon tanks have been brought into commission during the year and the total storage capacity in Abadan now caters for 780 000 tons of oil. Packed oils have continued to be supplied to the local markets and loading is now greatly facilitated by the installation of power driven conveyors to the jetty, and in order to supply cheap fuel and cheap kerosine to meet the require ments of local markets bulk supplies are available at convenient distribution centres, throughout the country. An extensive scheme for the construction of new living quarters for work men of the most up-to-date design has been commenced and quarters for a thousand men have been completed. There is also an extensive programme being carried out for the erection of bungalows for the European staff which ir nnn umbers The totai Iluinber of employees of other nationalities is now 10,000 men. . T . lie Pipe line capacity and pumping stations, have been increased. The dis- ti ibution organisation in 'Iraq and Persia have been developed.

M, Consul wrote :—- ' In spite of the, settlement of this long-standing dispute (i .e., the revenue question) between His Excellency and the Central Grovemment, there are still plenty of rocks ahead. The Central Government is deter mined to assert its authority throughout Arabistan, or rather Khuzistan as it is to be known in future, and it is not to be supposed that the Sheikh and his, Arab tribesmen will watch the process with folded hands.' This forecast proved only too correct. The Sheikh who was still simmering with resentment over the revenue settlement which he declared to have been forced on him by the British became mdre and more annoyed as minor forms of encroachment began to multiply. The Persian Government announced its intention of sending a Karguzar to Abadan who was also to act as Deputy Governor ; the Adliyeh at Shushtar began to summon Arabs, living in the Sheikh's territory to attend the Court ; a salt monopoly in the Sheikh's terri tory was given by the Ministry of Public Works to an Iraqi subject without the Sheikh being consulted in any way ; a Rais-i-Baladiyeh was appointed for Abadan although the Sheikh's revenue agreement provided that all indirect, tares were to be collected by himself ; steps were taken to asses.s the value of the Sheikh's date gardens with a view to further laxation ; heads of Persian departments in Ahwaz, instigated by the Russian Consul, met constantly and abused the Sheikh and the Commander of the Persian troops in Khuzis.tan did his best to foment trouble among the Arab tribes. Reports continually reached the Sheikh from Teheran that the Minister of War harboured sinister designs against him. His suspicions were aggravated by the persistent propaganda of Saqt-ul-Mulk the Governor General and Colonel Reza Quli Khan who had s;icceeded Colonel Baqir Khan as Commander of the Khuzistan detachment. The latter admitted to H. B. M. Consul that for six weeks he had steadily^dinned into the Sheikh's ears the fact that Sirdar Sipah and the Amir-i-Gharb were bent on overthrowing the Sheikh as soon as the posi tion in Luristan allowed troops to be brought into Dizful. When therefore the Sheikh received an official letter from the Prime Minister informing him that his firmans were cancelled, his indignation knew no bounds. He at once realised that this gave him an excellent opportunity to rally his tribes round him. He visited the Chaab Chiefs and informed them that the unconstitutional Government of which Sirdar Sipah was the head was bent on depriving them of the lands which they and their forefathers had owned for generations. His harangues met with such a favourable response that he lost no time in taking the Chaab Chiefs over to the Beni Turuf countrv and scaling Qorans with them as well. In all the written undertakings entered into with his Chiefs it was stipulated that whatever happened no harm was to be caused by Arabs to the persons or property of foreigners. Once the Sheikh was thoroughly satisfied as to the loyalty of his tribesmen and of the notables of Dizful and Shushtar w^ho had also sealed Qorans with him, his attitude began to harden in spite of the insistent advice of H. M. Vice-Consul that he should abandon his warlike preparations pending the conclusion of the negotiations proceeding in Teheran. He roundly asserted that he could not tolerate the presence of Persian troops in Arabistan and that he would insist on his revenues being restored to their prewar basis. He spent monev lavishly and his follow ing increased daily. The Sheikh was convinced that so favourable a moment for defending his rights would not recur, and it was with considerable disappointment that he received the news of Sirdar Sipah's recantation of the attitude he had taken up towards the Sheikh's firmans. He was, still hesitating what course to pursue when the arrival of a threatening telegram from the War Minister threw the tat once more mto the fire. He regarded it as proof positive of Sirdar Sipah's sinister intentions and made up his mind to a struggle a outrance. While he was m this mood Amir Mujahid arrived suddenly'from Ram Hormuz. The Sv ? WaS tll ? (3er or d e rs of banishment from the country, was not sjow to profit by the occasion ; the Arab Chiefs were called in to hear the contents'of the threatening telegram and responded by throwing their aqals and chafiyehs on the ground and vowmg to follow the Sheikh to the death. The most bidding51 oaths were then exchanged between the Arab Chiefs and Amir Mujahid who tried to induce the Sheikh to march at once on Shushtar and turn out the Persian garrison. The Sheikh was with difficulty restrained by H. B. M. Vice-Consul from doing s,o. At this juncture Mr. Peel returned from Teheran and in two lengthy inter- -views with Sirdar Aqdas endeavoured to allay his feares regarding the inten tions of the Prime Minister. It was immediately obvious that the Sheikh was determined to provoke an open rupture with Sirdar Sipah at any cost and by mobilizing every form of political pressure of which he was capable, to drive- Sirdar Sipah from office or obtain s^uch guarantees from the Persian Government as would enable him to live without fear of molestation in the future. He felt that he had gone too far to draw back and that even if a temporary peace were patched up between himself and Sirdar Sipah through the good offices of the British Government the struggle was bound to be renewed, and in a more acute form, at no distant date. He demanded that his allies, Amir Mujahid in parti cular, should not be molested, that all Persian troops should be withdrawn from Arabistan and that the revenue settlement to which he had agreed under force majeure should be revised. In the meantime he would not provoke hostilities but would defend himself if attacked and would leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety of the Pipe Line. The Sheikh's original plan of campaign was to march on Behbehan, evict the small Persian garrisons there and at Shushtar, mobilise the Bakhtiari and other tribes, with whom he had long been conducting negotiations, in his favour and wring from the Persian Government a recognition of hi^ semi-autonomous position in Khuzistan. He believed that the keen desire of H. M. Government to prevent any military operations in the vicinity of the Oilfields and Pipe Line would induce them to bring pressure to bear on the Persian Government to secure at least a partial acceptance of his demands. When he realised the extent to which he had alienated the sympathy of H. M. Government and the measure of moral support which the latter were pre pared to extend to the Central Government the Sheikh abandoned this plan and nought the active support of the Bakhtiari Khans and tribesmen. The Bakh tiari s were not slow to respond. Murteza Quli Khan, Shahab-es-Sultaneh and most of the younger Khans openly joined him. With the exception of Sirdar Assad and Amir J ang the Senior Khans gave him their secret sympathy and moral support. By the middle of October the military preparations of the Gov ernment were well advanced and as no formula had been devised in the mean time which would satisfy both the Persian Government and the Sheikh a conflict seemed inevitable in the direction of Behbehan. At this point a triangular meeting at Bushire between the Prime Minister, Sir Percy Loraine and the Sheikh was suggested by H. M. Government and was agreed to by the Prime Minister provided the Sheikh first tendered his formal submission to the Central Government. Even though a minor offensive by the Persian troops on the Zaidun front had already commenced, the prospect of Sir Percy Loraine's early return enabled H. M. Consul to obtain promises from the Sheikh and Murteza Quli Khan on the 8th November that their tribesmen would make no attack on Zaidun or Behbehan until Sir Percy Loraine should reach Ahwaz, and on the 10th November a promise from the Sheikh, that, provided the Prime Minister definitely guaranteed the meeting at Bushire, His Excellency would telegraph his submis.sion to the Central Government as soon as he had seen Sir P. Lorain'e. Sir Percy Loraine reached Ahwaz on the 13th November and the Sheikh's telegram of submission was despatched to the Prime Minister at Shiraz on the 14th. It soon became apparent that the latter was determined to evade his promise to attend the projected conference at Bnshire. He finally agreed to meet H. M. Minister and the Sheikh at Ahwaz where he arrived on December 4th by ear from Hindijan accompanied by a large retinue. During the interval a large force of Persian troops had reached Dizful from Khorramabad. The Sheikh and Sirdar Sipah swore mutual friendship on the Qoran. During the ensuing negotiations it was arranged that a temporary Governor should be ap pointed for Ahwaz who would have no authority to interfere with the Sheikh's authority over Arab tribes, and that Persian troops should remain in Northern Arabistan until the spring, when, provided the pacification of Luristan were complete, the main body would withdraw, leaving mere detachments. Since then the military occupation of Southern Arabistan has proceeded steadily. Military detachments have been ported at the headquarters of all52 tribes who previously owned allegiance to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Sartip Fazlullah Khan has been. appointed Governor General of Khuzistan and has taken np his headquarters at Ahwaz where there is a garrison of 1,500 troops Ahwaz, Mohammerah and Abadan each hr^ve their military Deputy'Governors and the Sheikh and his sons have ceased to function,. The Nazmieh has been taken out of the hands, of the Sheikh and is Rapidly being reorganised by Persian officials. The old regime is thus definitely at an end and the change has fortunately taken place without any serious interference with the activities of the Ansio- Persian Oil Company, Bakhtiari. —The tribal Governors, Sirdar Mohtasham and Amir Jang had succeeded in making themselves thoroughly unpopular by the middle of summer. The strained relations between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Central Government gave the opposing faction an opportunity to organise their forces with the result that at a conference of all the leading Khans, at Isfahan in Octo ber the Illkhani and Illbegi tendered their resignations and were succeeded bv Sirdars Zaffar and Jang. Amir Mujahid has fortunately been compelled to leave Persia for an indefinite period. Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd. —The Fields Manager writes as follows ' The drilling of new wells in Maidan-i-Naftun area has continued with satisfactory results, and good progress has, been made on outside tests m the vicinity of the Fields, proving further extensive areas. The great demand for crude oil continues and our production durino* the past year has been greater than ever, Pipe Line throue-hout bein«- approximately 4,500,000 tons. ^ &gt; 0 The following additional accommodation at Maidan-i-Naftun has been completed during the year :— 20 Bungalows. 2 Clerks quarters.

During the past year 161 local apprentices were passed out as Grade I artizans, and 515 apprentices wLe under going training at the end of the year. The number of Indian artizans employed on the 1st January 1924 was 729 and on the 31 s t December 1924, 623, which s.hows a decrease of 106 on the year. The railway from Dar-i-Khazineh to Fields has cam'prl ^ J.. v monthly tonage of 2 577 tons.. Motor mam road have now been eliminated. The health of the Company's staff has been remarkably good durinf the past year. There were 3 European deaths or .67 per c«nt. A considerable number of small-pox cases occurred amongst the native employees and it was undoubtedly due to the i the Company's medical staff that a'serio™ ouffi^eS^ • 4 Inte ^ ests -—Monsieur Batmanoff, who now calls himsplf Cnnqn] instead of Consular Agent, can congratulate himself ol a yeL oTusef JwH judged by Bolshevik standards.

It seems probable that the Lynch Eoad will shortly find a serious rival in the Pizful -Khorramabad road by which goods will be transported to Teheran more qnicklv and cheaplv than via Isfahan. At the moment, however, the pacification of theLurs is not complete and the almost total absence of supplies on the middle portion of the road is a serious obstacle to muleteers. CHAPTER IX.

A short skirmish took pla«e in which Saiyid Nadir s loss was 2 killed and 3 wounded. Nine boxes of ammunition and 9 camels were taken by the enemy. The Muscat Infantry was at that time with out a European Commandant. Saiyid Nadir and his party were compelled to return to Quryat. Prompt orders were despatched to Saiyid Nadir to return to Muscat with all his men. He however at first demurred as he naturally felt54 sore at his defeat by the Bani Battash tribe. He wished to advance again with reinforcements from the Muscat Infantry for which he applied to the Council ' f J^ i tr er o His for reinforcements was not however complied with and H. M. S. ' Triad ' was despatched to Quryat and Saiyid Nadir with all nis men were brought back to Muscat. Eventually it was arranged that Shaikh bultan of the Bani Battash should meet the Political Agent at a convenient snot on the sea coast. On the 6th of September, the Political Agent proceeded to meet the Shaikh at Quryat m R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' and on the 7th the meeting took place at which the Hail incident was fullv discussed. Saiyid Nadir was blamed for acting on his own impulse and without the full concurrence of the Council of Ministers. Shaikh Sultan represented that he had sent warn- Sai y I\adir not to proceed towards Hail with an armed force as if he did so he^ would meet opposition. Saiyid Nadir however would not listen ,and the meltable result took place. Reparations were demanded from the kJiaikh or the Bam Battash and the immediate return of all the lost propertv His personal submission at Muscat to His Highness the Sultan on the latter's return, from India was also insisted upon. Lost property, as far as possible, has been i^stored by the Shaikh. As regards the personal submission of the bliaikh.

The ostensible reason for the capture of the caravan was that the Bani Bu Ali alleged they had an outstand ing murder case against the Hijryin tribe and that the latter's caravans should be prevented from coming to Sur. A third tribe, the Bani Easib, who were the owners of the camels, were beaten'and their valuables confiscated. Subsequently the Shaikhs of Jaalan levied a tax of one dollar per camel on all laden camels going to and coming from Sur. Shaikh Isa bin Saleh how ever protested against the imposition of this unauthorised tax which affected his tribesmen and wrote a letter to the Political Agent on the subject. The Muscat Government was asked to write and enquire into the matter. The Shaikhs of Jaalan however denied the truth of the report, perhaps as they did not want to press matters too far. Saiyid Hamud bin Hamad, the Wali of Sur, has been practically powerless as legalds what happens in Sur, and has spent a good deal of his time at Sib smerely to escape his equivocal position. The Wali asked the Muscat Goveru- ment to give him some Arab levies to enable him to enforce his authority there but he was merely directed to carry on his work as well as he could. His liighness appears averse to any action, and it is difficult to see what he can do without help from the British Government. In November, the Shaikhs of Jaalan forced as Shaikh, a member of their trit)e on the Jannabah tribe at Sur in place of the old Shaikh. The new Shaikh is a relation of the Shaikh of Masirah. The Jannabah did not however favour the appointment and wished to have back their former Shaikh. There was some trouble over this appointment and the Shaikhs of Jaalan asked the Muscat Gov ernment to depute one of their Ministers to Sur to settle the dispute. To do this would admit the Jaalan's right to appoint Shaikhs- which is the pre rogative of His Highness the Sultan. The Council of Ministers refused to depute one of their members and replied that the Wall*should be referred to as he was the Government representative. ?. indu tradcr ' Watoomal Keshoomal, was kid- the ? edou f s i Musharfah tribe. Prompt action was taken by this Agency and the Local Government pressed the Wali of Sur to obtain the release of the man immediately. The man was released and brought back safely In September, the Political Agent visited Snr in E. I. M. S ' Lawrence ' to enquire mto the state of affairs in Sur. He found things far from beL satisfactory and the Sultan's authority disappearing. The Political Resident has been addressed as regards this state of affairs. ^■v ffair f S T in Mahomed bin Abdullah al Khalili has continued in the Saleh 88 the Chief of the tribesmen through • • i Xll i U i kl1 .

Alban, I.A., held the post of the Command ant from the lst( January to the 31st March, when he was invalided to England. His post remained vacant till the 9th July, when Captain Gr. J. Eccles of the l|4th Bombay Grenadiers arrived and assumed Command of the Muscat Infantry on the 10th July. Captain Eccles continued to hold the post till the end of the year. The men of the Infantry have continued to be efficient and their health good on the whole. Saiyid Salim in Faisal, His Highness's brother and Saiyid Mahmood, His Highness's cousin, resigned their posts of Jamadars in the infantry. The former has since rejoined the Infantry and has been promoted to the rank of Sabedar. Visits of Officials. —The Political Resident did not visit Muscat during the year. Mr. E. E. Gunter, O.B.E., Director, Persian Gulf Section, visited Muscat by the L G. T. S. ' Patrick Stewart ' on the 23rd February. His Excellency Rear Admiral R. W. Richmond, C.B., Naval Commander in Chief of the East Indies Station visited Muscat on the 18th October on H. M. S. ' Chatham ' flagship. Various Military officers of the regiment at Bushire visited Muscat on inspection duty of their detachment. Foreign Interests. —One Suleiman bin Abdullah al Baruni arrived in Muscat from Mecca early in August. He is said to be a well known Tripolitan agitator. He came on a visit to Muscat and to see His Highness the Sultan of Muscat who happened to be in India at the time. Baruni remained in Muscat as the guest of the Local Government till the 15th September, when he left for the interior at the invitation of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh. Here he was well received aT?d entertained by the Omanis. Suleiman Baruni however fell sick and being unable to return to Muscat remained at Sharkiyeh till the close of the year. He addressed a letter to His Majesty King Faisal of Iraq asking for a paid appointment. A reply has been received from Iraq for communication through this Agency that no appointment was available, but a short visit might be paid. On the 25th June, the Italian Cruiser 44 Calabria ' arrived at Muscat from the Persian Gulf and saluted the Muscat flag. Ceremonial visits were exchanged by Gustavo Aroldo Caccia, Capitano di Vascello and the Ministers of His Highness the Sultan. R. N. Calabria ' left for Aden and Kisimayu on 26th June. No French man-of-war visited Muscat during the year. French interests in Muscat are now non-existent. The Persian Gulf and the East Indies Squadrons. —The following ships of the Persian Gulf and the East India Squadron visited Muscat during the year :— H. M. S. 11 Cyclamen on 5th January, 4th July, 15th October, and 15th December. H. M. S. ^ Triad ', on 3rd February, 12th February, 22nd June and 26th November. H. M. S.

Lntton of the American Mission have been the only members of the mission in Muscat during the year leaving as usual for the summer recess. They talk of removing the mission to Mattrah as Muscat is now at a low ebb as regards population. Dr. Hosman paid professional visits at Sib in March and at Sohar in December. Climate and Weather. —Total rainfall during the year was 1.04 inches con sequently the supply of drinking water in Muscat is becoming scarce and brackish. Diminution of rainfall during the last 7 years has been most marked. The summer was most trying and more severe than for many years past, C. Gr. CEOSTHWAITE, Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent and H. B. M.'s Consul, Muscat* CHAPTER X. ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE TRUCIAL COAST OF OMAN FOR THE YEAR 1924. Personnel. —Khan Bahadur (so created on the King's Birthday) Isa bin Abdnl Latif was Residency Agent throughout the year. Slave Trade. —Ten slaves^, mostly negroes, were manumitted from this Coast during the year. The traffic in Baluchis, generally women and children, has not been entirely suppressed. These form the most convenient commodity which Mekrani gun-runners are able to give in payment for their imports ! The Arms Traffic, however, is also dying out. The Residency Agent is endeavouring to recover a number of kidnapped- children whose relatives profess to have traced them to various towns. Shargak. —The behaviour of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad was generally un satisfactory towards his townspeople. A rising occurred in November, assisted from outside by the H-eadmen of Haira and the Beni Katab Bedouins. After fojir days' hostilities during which eight persons were killed or wounded a truce was called. In the negotiations which followed, and at which the Shaikhs of Dibai and Ras-al-Khaimah and the Residency Agent assisted, Shaikh Khalid abdicated in favour of his young cousin. Sultan bin Saqar, w T ho was acclaimed as the rightful heir. It is now said that when Saqar bin Khalid died in 1914 he only appointed Khalid bin Ahmad to be regent during the minority of his son Sultan, and that Khalid has proved himself a disloyal guardian. II. M. S. ' Cyclamen ' arrived off Shargah as soon as possible after news of the rising reached Hen jam. She remained there until the settlement was reached and the agreement signed. The persons and property of British subjects suffered no injury. Shaikh Khalid had very thoroughly alienated from himself all sympathies of this Residency by his mismanagement and apathy in regard to the burglary of a Haiderabadi's shop, which occurred in March and was believed to have been perpetrated by his men: It remains .to be seen whether he will quietly settle down in some out lying village of the State, which he will be permitted to govern, or whether he prefers the role of stormy petrel, troubling all his erstwhile sovereign brothers. During the year, Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co., in accordance with their agree ment with the Shaikh of Shargah, shipped 20 tons of red oxide, which had previously been mined and left by Messrs. R. 'Wonckhaus &amp; Co., from Abu Musa Island as a sample to England. They did no mining themselves during the year, although their representative, Mr. Habakkuk, spent some weeks on the Island. Dibai. —A terrible epidemic of plague which commenced in December 1923 and ended in Ajml 1924 is believed to have started at this place and to have carried off several thousand victims. Dibai ton and the neighbouring villages— also Shargah were deserted by every one who could get away. The Residency Agent went to Ras-al-Khaima. Numerous fugitives carried the diasease disastrously to Kishm Island and a few cases appeared in Lingah.58 Delays to Mail Steamers again occasionally occurred. One vessel stayed five days at anchor and then over-carried all her cargo to Ba^rali. This neces sitated an extra call on the homeward voyage. In the latter part of the year there were no complaints. The Bunniahs at Dibai have complained loudly against the Shaikh for in creasing the rents of their shops by 500 per cent, in the course of a few years, and not allowing them to expand into other quarters of the town. As a matter of fact the rents they now pay—Rs. 950 per annum tov a small double room—are not higher than those paid in Bahrain. The traders also complained against the Hamal Bashi (State landing Contractor) for delaying the delivery of their goods. Complaints of this nature at one port or another are continually before the Residency I Ahu Dhahi.—Shaikh. Sultan bin Zaid's attitude towards the recovery of foreigners' claims against Abu Dhabi traders is still unsatisfactory. He spent most of the year in fighting the Beni Katab and Bedouin in and around Baraimi, his allies being the Manasir. Periodically it was said that peace was declared or a truce arranged through the mediation of other Shaikhs, but nothing lasting resulted. The Shaikh of Dibai was very nearly involved in the warfare as a number of his camels were carried off by Beni Katab. Ras al Khaimah. —Nothing to report. Umm al Qawani. —Nothing to report. Nothing to report. CHAPTER XI. ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN FOR THE YEAR 1924. % Personnel. —Charge of the Political Agency was held throughout the year by Major C. K. Daly. Captain D. R. Smith, held the post of Assistant Political Agent from June 9th to October 10th. The Ruler of Bahrain and Al Khalifah family. —Sheikh Sir Isa bin Ali, K.C.I.E., has continued his attitude of passive resistence to all changes made by Sheikh Hamad for the better rule of the islands, but as he now has little influence, and Sheik Hamad has to a great extent consolidated his position, his attitude no longer causes inconvenience. The agitation against the introduction of reforms, brought in by the Deputy Ruler Sheik Hamad bin Isa, C.I.E., which was so manifest in 1923, gradually diminished and finally disappeared. This agitation proved to be the work of the pearling nakhudas, who feared th,at by the removal of some of the obvious abuses in the pearling industry they would suffer finan cially. Their feelings were played upon by sympathisers of Sheik Isa among Al Khalifah family, who felt that the establishment of ordered rule under Sheik Hamad would curtail their powers of oppression. In January 1924 the disaffected members of Al Khalifah made a final effort to intimidate the Shiahs, to whose agitation for better treatment they ascribed the new regime. The sons of Sheik Khalid had been banished for their partici pation in the Sitrah outrage, (see Administration Report for 1923) and were living on the mainland opposite Bahrain. They landed in Bahrain in January and were joined by their eldest brother Ibrahim, a number of fidawis, (mainly Nejdis) and other persons of bad character encouraged by the prospect of loot. An armed attack was made on the Shiah village of Wadian in Sitrah with the object of taking vengeance on the persons who had given evidence at the former trial. Several Shiahs, including women and children, were killed and wounded. A great outcry was raised by the whole Shiah community. They came in thousands to the Agency and remained surrounding 'it for several days,crying out for the punishment of the evil-doers and the protection of their com- munity. . . Sheik Hamad was away on a hunting trip and he was immediately recaliecl ; for Sheik Muhammed, his brother who was acting for him &gt; was quite useless m the emergency, and his sympathies were probably with the aggressors. On his return, Sheik Hamad endeavoured to take action, and by various subterfuges, succeeded in arresting some of the participators in the outrage, though the sons of Sheik Khalid were allowed to escape to the mainland. The Hon'ble the Besident visited Bahrain and was successful in persuading Sheik Hamad to take action against the men who had been arrested. A trial was duly held, adequate punishment awarded, and the death sentence passed on the sons of Sheik Khalid, who had escaped arrest. _ Doubtless Sheik Hamad only brought himself to pass such a sentence in consideration of the fact that they were safely out of the way, and that it was extremely unlikely that it could ever be carried out. Nevertheless the effect was profound members of the ruling family having hitherto been secure from punishment for any offence. A1 Khalifah have now realised tbat the new regime is firmly established, and glaring oppression of Shiah subjects has ceased. During the crisis it became apparent that Sheikh Hamad, with no force what soever at his disposal, beyond a few dishonest and unreliable fidawis, had no means of maintaining law and order, or of exerting his authority. H.e was himself acutely aware of this, and applied for permission to raise a Levy Corps on the lines of the Muscat Levies. This request was acceded to, a Levy Corps was formed in June, and Captain A. Campbell, Indian Army, appointed to com mand it. Reforms in the local administration.—During the year under report Sheik Hamad made considerable progress with the introduction of reforms into the local administration. The overhauling of the Customs Department which had been commenced in September 1923 was completed, and plans were laid for improvements to be carried out during 1925. Mr. C. de Grenier arrived in January and took up his duties as Director of Customs, under a three year contract with the Sheikas government. The main abuses in the pearl diving industry have been checked, and pro gress is slowly being made towards obtaining improved conditions for the divers. During the season a system was introduced, whereby all pearling nakhudas are obliged to give each of their divers a copy of his individual account, this is entered in a divers book ' which the latter keeps in his possession. The svstem was found to work remarkably well during the 1924 season, and the divers are learning to protect their own interests. The principal difficul ties are experieneed over the accounts for previous years. In the case of many divers these cover a period as long as eighteen years. Many of the nakhudas kept no intelligible accounts ; others had accounts which were utterly unreliable. These difficulties are overcome by a settlement in the Shar'a Court. The Qadhi's decisions are now accepted without dispute by the nakhudas, and he usually contrives to secure tolerable terms for the divers, ajid to reduce to a reasonable figure the huge debts which the nakhudas claim as outstanding against nearly every diver. The new accounts are then opened in the ' divers' books ' with the balances proved in the Shar'a Court. Under the new system of annual accounting there should be no further serious oppression on this score. The state is further taking steps to limit the advances which the Nakhudas make to their divers, in order that no diver may become virtually enslaved through being hopelessly in debt, which has always been the case in the past. The nakhudas are required to keep a '' general account '' shewing the out- lay on each boat, value of pearls sold and consequent share of each diver. The diving season lasts for four months and ten days, and the State has laid down that no diver shall receive, under any circumstances, less than Rs. 260 (which amounts to Rs. 2 per diem) for the season. This step resulted from the analysis of the accounts of a very large number of divers, from which it was apparent that the majority of divers did not, in the past, actually earn as credits in their accounts as much as even Re. 1 per working day, although they usually received from Rs. 2 to 3 per day in advance ; most of this was however recorded as a debt60 recoverable from the diver, so that each season left him further in debt and completely in the nakhuda's power. A few years of careful supervision on the p^rt of the state, particularly with regard to the ^ general accounts,' should enable the majority of divers to become free of debt and to enjoy their legitimate earnings. The divers themselves have not been slow to recognise the advantages of the new system, and freely resort to the courts when they consider themselves oppressed. The opposition of the nakhudas to the production of their accounts in court has disappeared. In previous years the nakhudas, with one accord, declined to produce their accounts in any court except that of. the Salifah' which was presided over hya corrupt individual appointed by them, and in their pay.^ In the solving of the 7 many difficult problems which had to be faced during the introduction of these reforms. Sheik Hamad has most willingly conferred with the Political Agent, and has shewn himself really desirous of removino- . abuses. In this attitude he has been staunchly supported by Sheik Qasim bin Mehza, the chief Qadhi, who had for many years vainly endeavoured to induce Sheik Isa to control the activities of the nakhudas. Record of Rights —The Deputy Ruler has been anxious to proceed with the compilation of Record of Rights in landed property, in order to put a stop to the depredations of the various members of A1 Khalifah which has been the cause of so much unrest of late years. Before he can proceed with this plan a survey of the islands is necessary. It was hoped that this survey could have been carried out in 1924, but the difficulty of obtaining trained personnel for the purpose has necessitated its postponement until 1925. Meanwhile however i 8 - i e ^T U ^ 1 ? U ^ er ^ las ^. e . en a ^ e settle a considerable number of land disputes' wmch should much facilitate the work of recording rights when it is ultimately smarted In the course of these settlements large number of cases has come to light m which Sheik Isa (generally as the result of false information supplied by ins fidawis) had sold the same land several times over, or in selling a plot of state land had given documents which included neighbouring plots already owned by others. In such cases, Sheik Hamad has either compensated the iniured t ^ P A 0 . ts of state land ' or refu nding the purchase money ^ Isa - t* 118 Purpose he budgeted an adequate sum of money in 1924, and intends to budget for similar expenditure, where necessary, when the record of rights is finally made. This action has removed a great'deal of the dissatisfaction which existed, and is tending to make him deservedly popular. pr ° pe r!;y h f ve now t0 be registered in the state land omce, so tnat such injustices should not recur. Education.—In the budget for 1924 the Deputy Ruler set aside monthly a heLtendst? ^ u d ' A t S S® 011 as sufficient capital has accumulated , ® , s , uppI y a 1111X011 felt w ant by opening two elementary schools.

The following visits were paid by His Majesty's Ships— H. M. S. Crocus—Five. H. M. S. Cyclamen—Seven. H. M. S. Triad—Two. In November the Commander-in-Chief visited Bahrain in H. M. S. Chatham together with His Majesty's Ships Cairo, Colombo, Lupin, Triad, Crocus, Cyclamen and Bapidol. While the above ships were in harbour two steamers of the British India company were also present, making a total of ten ships in harbour at once, a gathering unprecedented in Bahrain. VisHs were paid by ships of the Royal Indian Marine as follows— E. I. M. S. Lawrence—Seven. R. I. M. S. Elphinstone—One. Cable Ship Patrick Stewart—One. Visits of Government Officials. —The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel A. P Trevor, O.S.I., C.I.E., and the Hon 'ble Lieut.-Colonel F. B. Prideaux, C.S.I., C.I.E., each visited Bahrain twice. His Excellency Rear Admiral H. M. Richmond C. B., Naval Commander- in-Chief arrived on November 14th, and left Bahrain on November 19th. Mr. E. E. Guntur, O.B.E., Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs visited Bali- ram in March. Visit by Aeroplanes.—On June 8th three aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force station at Shaibeh (Iraq), under the command of Squadron Leader Peck, arrived m Bahrain, and returned to Iraq on June 12th. During the interval several flights were carried out over the Islands. The Deputy Ruler Shaik llamad bin Isa, C.S.I., and the Political Agent, were given the benefit of a flight ot one and a half hours duration, which enabled the Shaik to obtain an air view ot the whole of his dominions, and included a visit to the Bahrain pearling fleet, winch was then at work on the pearl banks some forty miles from Bahrain The experience Was greatly appreciated by the Shaik, who invited the Air Force Umcers to repeat their visit whenever possible. The landing ground which had een prepared for the occasion by the courtesy of the Shaik, was found to be satis- l aC ^ ry V» i 1 beei } markcd witl:i the necessary pillars, ^nd permanently reserved by the Ruler for aircraft in the future. Bahrain, with its favourable position is perhaps worthy of consideration as a future air station, in view of the proposed air service between England and India. It is believed that the Ruler would welcome the establishment of an aerodrome. Judictal.—The number of civil suits filed in the court of the Political A^ent : o r m T g W 76 f r WaS J 0U - r ll ^ dred and seve n Criminal cases were disposed &lt;ot The court was closed during the month of Ramadhan.

Medical. —Assistant-Surgeon R. Holmes was in charge of the Victoria Memo rial Hospital throughout the year. The number of out-patients treated was .. .. 4,126 The number of in-patients treated was .. .. 113 Epidemics. —Plague, which was probably introduced from Dubai, was. pre valent with great severity during the early part of the year. It is estimated that over 4,000 .deaths occurred from this cause. The outbreak started very slowly and could, in all probability, have been checked, but for the ignorant pre judice of the population who were unwilling, on religious grounds, to co-operate in adopting the necessary measures, although the Sheikh was prepared to provide a segregation hospital, and financial assistance for families segregated. Anti- plague inoculation was resorted to, but it was extremely difficult to induce the inhabitants to apply for it until the epidemics had assumed alarming^ proportions, by which time inoculatior had lost much of its value as a preventive. Seven hundred and thirty-seven inoculations were given in the Hospital and 3,141 were given outside. Great credit is due to Assistant-Surgeon Holmes, who worked extremely hard during this trying period. Small-pox was sporadic during the year, but vaccination was little resorted to. ^ Forty-eight medico-logal cases came before the Political Agent's Court, the majority of which were cases of common assault. Medical Arrangements made hy the Bahrain State. —Early in the year the Bahrain State purchased a fine boom (dhow) built in Kuwait, which was fitted out as a hospital boat for the use of the Bahrain pearling fleet. It was unfortu nately impossible to secure the services of an Assistant-Surgeon in time for the diving, but Assistant-Surgeon Holmes volunteered his services, and made a short visit of about ten days duration to the pearl banks towards the end of the season- A considerable number of cases were treated,- sick divers often jumping over board and swimming some distance from their own dhows to the hospital boat in their anxiety to obtain treatment. It is hoped that the services of a sub- assistant-surgeon will be procured in time for the next diving season. The State has opened a small free dispensary in the town of Muharreq, which the Shaikh intends to improve in due course. The Sultan of Nejd.—Sultan Abdul Aziz ibn Sa'ud was at Rivadh at the- beginning of the year. He moved to Hasa about the 15th January and thence to Qasim about the 15th April. Early in May he proceeded to Rivadh, where he remained till the beginning of November, when he left for Mecca. He remained at Mecca until the close of the year. At the end of July a report reached Bahrain that the Sultan had despatched nf S 6 m T' h o stl Jl ttes Wlt l m Yahya of Yemen in the neighbourhood ot hjbha. Nothing further was heard subsequently in this connection A report was received at the same time that a large force was being-assembled at Artawiya to attack Trans-Jordania via Hail and Kharbut. Early in Auo'u«t it was reported that this force .had left Hail for Jauf. This was confirmed by onteUthAu^sT aM_0n 3 Pla0e ten mifes SOuth of ATmr ' a » &gt; , ; 0 Si the Sa r^® t f me all0t ^ er . of Akhwan from Riyadh was despatched nf TT. •« ?A Ce . eap A t 1 nred Taif 011 the 9th September, defeated a force of Hejaz troops under Amir All sent out against it and entered Mecca without any resistance about the middle of October.

The Mission is known to be63 anxious to establish a hospital in Nejd, but it is believed that the Sultan does not welcome the proposal though he is in need of medical assistance ; he is dis trustful of the introduction of any foreign influence. Postal. —There has been the normal service of mail steamers throughout the year, weekly from India, and fortnightly from Basra. It would be of great advantage to the islands if it were possible to introduce a weekly service to Ind.a during the pearl season. Mails for Europe can now be despatched from Bahrain via Baghdad and the Motor Mail service to Beirut, which effects a considerable saving of time for the homeward mails, owing to the service from Basra being^pnly fortnightly. Climate. —Rainfall was slightly below the average. The surjimer was milder than usual. CHAPTER XII. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1924. Personnel. —Major J. C. More, D.S.O., held charge of the Political Agency throughout the year. Assistant Surgeon E. M. Cuzen, I.M.D., was in Medical Charge of the Agency .and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer from the beginning of the year till the 21st April ; Assistant Surgeon J. Gr. Johnstone, O.B .E., l.MJ)., from the 22nd April' till the 15th June ; and Assistant Surgeon J. W. Woo'd-seil, M.C., I.M.D., from the 16th June to the end of the year. Condition of the country. —Trade with Najd remained closed throughout the year, and there were even indications that Ibn Sa'ud was anxious to stop the import of goods from Kuwait by sea through Jubail and other ports. On the 15th March the Ikhwan, under Faisal ad-Dawish, raided the shephered section of the Zaiyad and other 'Iraq tribes at Ummal-Has.him, a few miles within 'Iraq territory to the north of Bir Ansab, the most westerly point of the neutral zone between 'Iraq and Najd. It appears that the disciplined force of the Ikhwan consisted of ab6ut a thousand men. These, however, were joined by an indiscriminate mob of ill-armed Bedouin, attracted by the hope of plunder when the word went round that Faisal ad-Dawish was going raiding. These latter came and went at will, and, although they swelled his numbers, were really more of a hindrance than a help to Dawish. From the Ikhwan point of view the raid was badiy managed, and not very successful. The advanced guard pressed too far forward and lost touch with the main body. When they cam3 up with their objective, it was late in the day and their horses were tired out. The 'Iraq, tribesmen defended themselves stubbornly, and succeeded in withdrawing nearly all their camels to safety, though they lost a considerable number of sheep and donkeys. About thirty 'Iraq tribesmen were killed, and seven of the Ikhwan. The Ikhwan camped on the spot that night, and remained there all the next day* The following morning three British aeroplanes passed over them. Faisal ad- Dawish assured them that they had nothing to fear from them that day, but told them that the aeroplanes would no doubt bomb them the next day if they could find them. They accordingly withdrew forthwith; and retired to a place of safety. Considerable anxiety was felt in Kuwait at the end of March as the result of a report that Dhaidan al-IIithlain, the paramount shaikh of the'Ajman, was- advancing to raid the 'Iraq tribes which were grazing in Kuwait territory, and also to punish the Diyahin (a sept of the AuM Wasil sub-section of the Buraih section of the Mutair), who some time before had seceded from Najd and taken refuge in 'Iraq whence they had raided into Najd, and who were then encamped near Jahrah. A panic ensued amongst the 'Iraq tribesmen, and also amongst the inhabitants of the villages of Fantas, Abu Hulaifah, Fuhaihil and Shu'aibah,, on the coast to the south of Ras al-Ardh, who flocked into Kuwait for refuge. The report was premature, however, as it transpired afterwards that Dhaidan al-Hithlain had never left Sarrar, which is his normal headquarters. The scare was beginning to die down, when, at dawn on the 25th April, a party of r Ajman under Dhaidan al-Hithlain, together with some Mutair, raided the country round Jalib ash-Shuyukh, ten miles south-south-east of Kuwait,64 They failed in their main objective, which appears to have been to punish the Diyahin who were^ camped near there, but killed eleven men and wonnded over twenty—all Kuwait subjects—^and plundered a number of sheep, donkeys ajjd camels. The raiders then went to Fantag, the most northerly of the four vil lages mentioned above which are known collectively as the Qusur, but were driven off by the villagers. Ori the morning of the 27th April all the inhabitants of these Qusur villages came in panic into Kuwait, saying that a large force of Ikhwan was advancing, but their fear proved to be entirely without foundation. These events caused much nervousness in Kuwait. On the 27-th April a meeting of the leading townsmen was held, and, although the Shaikh assured them that they had nothing to fear, and said.that he had written a letter of com plaint to Ibn Sa'ud and that no further action was necessary, they insisted on the wall being strongly manned at night as a precautionary measure—and this was done for some considerable time. On the 14th May the Shaikh deceived a letter from Ibn Sa'ud, expressing his regret at this raid, which he said he was equiring into. On the 19th he receiv ed Ibn Sa ; ud's reply to his formal letter of complaint, and in this he definitely promised to have restitution made. The animals were eventually returned in the beginning of August, less such as had died—which, however, constituted a very considerable number. On the 7th May a raiding party from 'Iraq sighted a force of Ikhwan with three standards at Mujdair, which apparently consisted of eighty horsemen and three hundred camel riders under Haif-al-Fuqam of the Sahabah sept of the Muwahah sub-section of the Tlwah section of the Mutair. The 'Iraqis at once retired, but on the 8th they saw the same force at Shuqaiq, less than forty miles south of Jahrah, and gave warning of the fact at Jahrah on their way through. Some alarm was caused when the news reached Kuwait, but two days later the force retired to the south again without doing anything. An important tribal affray took place at Nuqair, 110 miles south of Kuwait on the 20th May. Habis bin 'Ashwan, of the 'Ubaiyat sept of the Aulad Wasil sub-section of the Buraih section of the Mutair, had raided the 'Awazim. The latter had appealed to Ibn Sa'ud who had ordered restitution to be made, and had told the 'Awazim that they were at liberty to attack Ibn 'Ashwan if he failed to comply with this order. As Ibn' Ashwan kept making excuses and refused to dis gorge all the plunder^ the 'Awazim, under their paramount shaikh, Ibn Jami' of the Had alin sub-section of the Ku'ah section of the tribe, attacked him and captured all his property. Ibn 'Ashwan, who had only about 150 men with him and was greatly outnumbered by the 'Awazim, but up a very stubborn fight, but he himself, his son and more than half his followers were killed. The 'Awazim also suffered very heavily. On the 31st May Ibn Shuqair, of the famous Dushan family of the Muwahah sub-section of the 'Ilwah section of the Mutair, (to which Faisal ad-Dawish also belongs), and founder of the Ikhwan village of Qaryah, or Jaryah as it is always, pronounoed, attacked the Dhafir at Qusair, some thirty-five to forty miles south west of Nasiriyah. At first the Dhafir were overpowered and forced to retire. Afterwand's, however, they rallied and counter-attacked the Ikhwan who were then collecting booty, and inflicted a crushing defeat on them^ Ibn Shuqair himself being: amongst the killed. In the latter part of June Ibn Sa'ud's son, Faisal, arrived at Qaryah to try and settle various tribal disputes on behalf of his father, and remained there for some time. It was he who finally effected the return of the plunder taken by the 'Ajman in the Jalib ash-Shuyukh raid. On the 5th August a party of Ikhwan, believed to have been Mutair from Qaryah, raided Mudairah, a camping ground on the north side of Kuwait Bay, some nineteen miles from Jahrah, and plundered over two hundred sheep belong ing to Kuwait subjects. On the 26th December a party of Tkhwan raided the Zaiyad and other 'Iraq tribes near TJmm-ar-Rahl, about sixty-five miles south of Nasiriyah. On the 28th December the raiders were located and bombed by British aeroplanes, and fled, abandoning the sheep which they had plundered. Some of these sheep were subsequently found by Kuwait Arabs in an exhausted condition to the west of Jahrah, and were looked after by the Shaikh's orders until they could be handed pver to their owners.m Arms Traffic. — One of tlie precautionary measures taken by the Shaikh at the time of Dhaidan al-Hithlain's raid at the end of April was a registration of arms in the town. On the 1st May it was reported to the Shaikh's Chief of the Police that a • Najdi shopkeeper had a store of rifles hidden away, in addition to four which he had registered. On being questioned the man denied this, and gave a written guarantee that he had none. The Chief of the Police, however, was not satisfied, and on searching his premises, found sixty-two rifles hidden beneath some wool in a store-room. The iShaikh confiscated these rifles—as also the four which he had declared. Just at the close of the year the Shaikh captured and confiscated two con signments of arms which were being smuggled from Kuwait, the larger consisting of twenty-one rifles. In one case the rifles had been loaded in a boat, hidden in the straw, etc., on which some sheep were standing, and were detected by the Customs Department. The other consignment had been buried in the sand out side the to™ wall, no doubt preparatory to being loaded into a boat, and was discovered by chance by some of the Shaikh's.servants who were out exercising his horses. In the latter case the smugglers were not traced ; but in the former they were arrested and imprisoned. Slave Trade, —During the summer months the existence of a traffic in Arme nian slave girls became known, and the Shaikh was induced to take steps to suppress it. On the 14th September he issued a proclamation to the effect that the traffic in Armenian girls was prohibited within the boundaries of Kuwait, as they were free-born and it was unlawful to enslave them. Anyone dealing in them in future would be liable to punishment, and anyone who then had any was to communicate with the Shaikh. Subsequently, at the Shaikh's request, Mrs. Calverley of the American Mis sion individually inspected sixteen girls whose names had been given to the Shaikh or heard of by the Political Agent, but none of them wished to be rescued,, or even acknowledged that she was a Christian. With one exception, all whom she saw were fair enough in complexion to have been Armenians—some being very fair—and two or three had recent tattoo marks, Mrs. Calverley thought that some were probably lying, but that the majority were speaking the truth, and did not know anything about their origin—as might well be the case if they had been taken from their homes when quite small. In any case she was satisfied that all of them were contented and that none wished to be rescued, so no further action was taken in their case. Pearl Fishery, —The Kuwait Pearling Fleet was larger than it had been for several years, and consisted of about 450 boats. The catch on the whole was small, and not so good as that of 1923, largely due to the fact that the yield of oysters from the northern banks, where the smaller boats of Kuwait fish, was considerably below the average. The pearl market too was not good. Oil Concession. —Major F. Holmes, of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd.j arrived in Kuwait in March to negotiate with the Shaikh for an oil con cession. In April the Shaikh of Kuwait, jointly with the Sultan of Najd, granted a Concession to the Syndicate for the whole of the Neutral Zone, in which both Bulers have equal rights. Messrs. Popham and Heim, geologists of the Syndicate, left Kuwait on the 28th April with an escort provided by Ibn Sa'ud, to conduct a preliminary survey of the Neutral Zone, and also for that portion of Hasa for which the Syndicate has obtained a Concession. Water Plarit. —Mr. A. Campbell, of Messrs. George Scott and Son (London), Ltd., having completed the dismantling and removal of the Kuwait Water Dis tillation 'Plant, left for the United Kingdom on the 24th March. Conference.--A Conference of representatives of Arab States, under the presidency of Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Knox, C.S.I., C.I.E., with Major J. C. More, D.S.O., as Secretary, had assembled at Kuwait in the middle of December 1023 to discuss various matters outstanding between them. Subih Bey Nashat, Minister of Communications and Works, 'Iraq, accompanied by Shaikh 'Ajil ^1-Yawar of the Shammar, Shaikh 'Abdullah al-Musfir aVMudhaifi, and a sec retary, represented 'Iraq ; Colonel 'Ali Khulqi Bey (now Pasha), Minister of66 Education, Trans-Jordania, represented Trans-Jordania ; while tlie Najd Dele gation consisted of Saiyid Hamzali-al-Ghauth (President), Dr. 'Abdullah Effendi Damluji. Mulla Hafidh Wahabah, Abdul 'Aziz bin Hasan-al-Qusaibi and Saivid Hasliim bin Ahmad ar-Rafa'i. At the oommencement of the year Mulla Hafidh was on his way to Hasa to confer with the Sultan of Najd ; and Subih Bey, accompanied by Shaikh r Agil-al y awar, had proceeded to Baghdad to consult his principaL Subih Bey returned to Kuwait on the 16th January. On the 17th January Colonel 'Ali Khulqi Bey left for Basrah en route for 'Amman to consult his principal. On the 19th January the 'Iraq and Najd Delegations submitted a joint letter to the President in which they stated that, as preliminary agreement had been reached on the majority of the points which had come up for discussion,, with the notable exception of the demand put forward by Najd for the return of her fugitive tribesmen, they considered that nothing more could usefully be discussed unless, or until, their instructions were modified, and recommended a protracted adjournment of the Conference to enable them to consult their Prin cipals. The 'Iraq Delegation left for Baghdad on the 26th January; and the- Kajd Delegation for Hasa on the 1st February. The Najd Delegation returned to Kuwait on the 27th February, less Saiyid Hamzah al-Ghauth and 'Abdul 'Aziz al-Qusaibi, Dr. 'Abdullah Effendi having been appointed president in place of the former. On the . 22nd March Ibrahim Hashim Bey and Colonel 'Ali Khulqi Pasha arrived at Kuwait by air from Shu'aibah Aerodrome near Basrah to represent Trans-Jordania. The 'Iraq Delegate, who had left Baghdad with them, was stopped at Basrah by the Government of 'Iraq, who had received news of the Ikhwan raid at Umm al-Hashim referred to above. From then onwards it was evident that thQ Conference was doomed to failure, and it eventually ended on the 12th April, when Colonel Knox left for Bombay en route for Europe. The various Delegates left Kuwait at about the same time. Medical. —'The health of the town was good throughout the year, and there were no epidemics of any kind. The chief complaints were respiratory malaria,, digestive and eye diseases. 4,769 out-patients, including 1,161 women and 1,034 children, were treated ?rr the Charitable Dispensary during the year, as compared with 6,463 during 1923. On the men's side of the American Mission Hospital 2,971 patients were treated, and on the women's side 3,486, making a total of 6,457, as compared with 5-074 in 1923. American Mission.- —Rev. and Mrs. E. E. Calverley and three children; accompanied by Miss Robertson as the latter's governess, arrived from America on the 17th January, and resumed their work at the American Mission. Dr. P. W. Harrison arrived from India on the 25th July to do the work of Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, 0&gt;B.E., qhmng the. latter '^ vacation. Dr. and Mrs. Mylrea left for India on the 29th July, and returned on the 20th November. Dr. Harrison left for Bahrain on the 5th November. He returned, accom panied by Mrs. Harrison and two children, for duty in Kuwait on the 20th November. Miss Van Pelt arrived from America, via Damascus, Baghdad and Basrah on the 18th November. A daughter was born to Dr. and Mrs. Harrison on 13th December. Miss Strang left for Bombay on the I7th December- In addition to the above Miss Scardefield was in Kuwait throughout the^ year. Frn^s—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited Kuwait in R. I. M. S. Lawrence on the afternoon of the 22nd March, and left for Bushire the same evening. Captain F. H. E. Townshend, R.E., Executive Engineer of the Persian Gulf Division, arrived on the 17th April and left for Bushire on the 22nd.His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa al-Khalifah, O.S.L, accompanied by Major C. K. Daly, Political Agent, Bahrain, visited Kuwait in R. I. M. S. Lawrence on the 25th July. The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel F. B. Prideaux, C.S.L, C.LE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived in Kuwait in R. I. M. S. Elphinstone on the 18th October and left on the 14th. His Excellency Rear Admiral H. W. Richmond, C.B., Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, visited Kuwait in H. M. S. Chatham, accompanied by H. U S. Triad, on the 28th October and left on the 29th. Naval and Marine. —The following ships of His Majesty's Navy and of the Royal Indian Marine visited Kuwait during the year:— R. I. M. S. Lawrence arrived on 22nd March and left the same day. R. I: M. S. Lawrence arrived on 14th June and left the same day. H. M. S. Cyclamen arrived on 26th June and left on 3rd July. R. I. M. S. Lawrence arrived on 25th Juby and left the same day. R. T. M. S. Elphinstone arrived on 13th October and left on 14th. H. M. S. Chatham arrived on 28th October and left on 29th. H. M. S. Triad arrived on 28th October and left the same day. R. I. M. S. Elphinstone arrived on 2nd November and left on 3rd. In addition to the above the Italian Cruiser Calabria arrived in Kuwait on the 20th June and left on the 21st. Royal Air Force. —Group Captain I. T. Courtney, C.B.E., Commanding the Basrah Group, Royal Air Force, with two aeroplanes from Basrah landed at Kuwait on the 14th March and returned the same day. Three aeroplanes, under the command of Squadron Leader E. D. Atkinson, D.F.C., A.F.C., Commanding No. 84 (Bombing) Squadron, Royal Air Force, landed on the afternoon of the 22nd March, and returned to Shu'aibah Aero drome the following morning. Squadron Leader R. E. Saul, D.F.C., of the Basrah Group Staff, visited Kuwait on the 2nd April, and returned to Basrah the same afternoon. Three aeroplanes, under the command of Squadron Leader H. Peck, O.B.E. y Commanding No. 84 (Bombing) Squadron, Royal Air Force, Avhich had proceed ed to Bahrain on the 8th June, left there for Kuwait at 11-30 a.m . on Thursday the 12th June. They encountered a heavy head wind the whole way, and, from Jabal Manifah, a thick sand storm as well. Only one machine, that of Squadron Leader Peck himself, arrived at Kuwait that evening, and it was unable to identify the aerodrome, and landed considerably to the west of it at 6 p.m. Flight Lieutenant H. V. Rowley, with Flying Officer R. F. Randell, A.F.C. r as passenger, in the second aeroplane, which, had landed near Ras al-Khafji, arrived early next morning. They reported that they had seen the third aeroplane on its nose in bad ground between Ras al-Qulai'ah and Shu'aibah, the most southerly of the Qusur villages. Squadron Leader Peck had telegraphed to Basrah, asking for relief aero planes to be sent with spare petrol (his two machines being immobile through lack of petrol), but at 9 a.m . he received a telegram to the effect that two aero planes which had started had been forced to return by bad weather. As the wind, which was then heavy, seemed to be increasing, and as there was also a sand-storm which rendered visibility practically nil) there appeared to be little or no hope of help coming by air that day. Accordingly the Political Agent, accompanied by Flying Officer Randell and a representative of the Shaikh to act as guide, started out in two Ford cars. They'arrived at Shu'aibah village at 1 p.m ., and learned that the two aviators (Flying Officer V. S. Lacey and a corporal) were well, and that they had been into the village that morning, and had been supplied with tea, milk, fruit, etc., by the villagers. As it was impossi ble to get a motor car beyond Shu'aibah, a message was sent to them to come into the village which they did. After arranging with the villagers to provide a guard for the aeroplane, the party started back, and eventually got into Kuwait at 8 p.m.eg Flying Officer Lacey reported that, with a new radiator and propeller, he v^ould be able to fly l.iS aeroplane into Kuwait, and finally to Shu'aibah Aero drome. These parts were at once telegraphed for, and arrived in two aeroplanes in the evening of the 14th June. A supply of petrol having also arrived by R. I. M. 8. Lawrence, all four aeroplanes left Kuwait for Shu'aibah Aerodrome on the 15th June. On the evening of the 15th June Flying Officer Lacey and his mechanic, accom panied by the Agency Munshi, left for Shu'aibah village by sailing boat with his necessary spares, and, after repairing the machine, flew into Kuwait, and on to Shu'aibah Aerodrome on the 17th June. Postal. —There was a weekly service of mail steamers from India through out the year, and a fortnightly service from Basrah. To supplement the latter, mails were also sent from Basrah to Fao as opportunity offered, and brought from there by water boat by a special postman. Exchange. —The rate of exchange of Maria Theresa dollars varied from Es. 166 per hundred at the beginning of the year to Rs. 193 in November. At the close of the year it was Rs. 188-13-4. British Sovereigns and Turkish Pounds averaged Rs. 15-8-8 and Rs. 14-4-0 respectively, but were both somewhat below those figures at the close of the year. Indian Currency Notes fluctuated considerably, being at a discount of as much as 6 as. per Rs. 100 during the four summer months, and at a premium at most other times—the highest being 10 as. per Rs. 100 at the close of the year. Climate. —The summer, although hotter than that of 1923, was not a parti cularly hot one. At the close of the year there was a spell of quite exceptionally cold weather, the thermometer falling to below freezing point, which is most unusual for ICuwait. According to some of the older inhabitants, it was the coldest weather that has been experienced in Kuwait since 1897. 4.32 inches of rain fell during the year, mostly at the end of January, when it was unusually heavy and did considerable damage to buildings, and in the latter half of December.
