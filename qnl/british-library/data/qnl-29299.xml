I understand that our establishment at Khor Quwai consisted of a wireless and cable station with the necessary buildings and accommodation, stores, etc. over and above what was agreed with the Sultan in 1935. All mobile wireless equipment has now been removed and the cable is no longer connected. The buildings with some heavy equipment remain in charge of caretakers. 3. In a future war it is likely that similar facilities would be required at Khor Quwai, and the best thing from our point of view is to keep them in care and maintenance as at present. 4. Nov; that the war subsidy is finished I suppose that the Sultan will be asking us to pay rent for the buildings in care and maintenance. Provided that he does not ask an exorbitant amount we should have no objection to this, but we should like to be consulted before you commit us to anything. Yours sincerely F.A.K.

'V; ILD liDOGE 7th January, 1947 The Hon'ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf Viiith reference to your letter 3-3 of 2nd January, 1947, the present state of affairs at Khor Kuwai is that with one exception all the Naval Base buildings are contained on the peninsular HAS SAL.CB at the North East tip oi tne island. 2. The exception to the above is the transmitting, station and three W/T Masts with a N/T earth array, which is sited about five hundred yards due west of Has 3alib on top of a hill about 160 feet high. The whole is contained in an area about 200 by 120 feet. 3. The whole base is in Care and Maintenance under the charge of a CaretaAer and about six local coolies, who are paid and provided with certain rations by the Royal Navy. None of the buildings are used by the Royal Navy other than by this caretaking party. 4. It is known that Their Lordships attach the greatest importance to the retention of Khor Kuwai and its facilities - particularly the W/T Station - in case of the general situation in the Persian Gulf should at any time deteriorate. 5. From the papers that are available, there is little doubt that the scale of the base far exceeds anything visualised when first permission to use the island was granted by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in 1935/36. In particular the erection of the Transmitting Station might be considered an encroachment. 6. Under these circumstances, it is requested that tne question of their retention in situ may be raised with the Sultan and his permission obtained. It is presumed that the subsidiary Agreement mentioned in the minutes of a conversation held between Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf and C.G.P. in 1943, forwarded to me in your No.24-3 of 3rd January, 1947, still holds for any future period of hostilities. 7. This matter was discussed with the Political Agent, Muscat on 7th January, and I am given to understand that the retention of buildings on Khor Kuwai is not objected to provided that the question of rent, now that the war subsidy has been withdrawn, can be settled* 8. It would seem, therefore, that this question will have to be raised with the appropriate Government department, and I am therefore sending a copy of this correspondence to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station for his information.

Would you please refer to the Political reside:it s telegram Nos. 61 of 15th January and T/3 of 19th January about Naval facilities at Khor Quwai. 2. We feel that it would be better to deal with this question seoarately from that of facilities for the R.A.P. in Muscat and the Air Ministry a^ree. 3. Ab regai-da Khor ^wai, you will be aware that the Bultan’a original agreement for the Nary’s use of the Island was contained in the correspondence forwarded under the Political ties id© n s Express Letter No.C/64 of 2nd April, 1935, a copy of which was sent to the Admiralty at the time. This conveyed the Mil tan s permission for the use of the northern part of the j aland for the purpose of constructing saall buildings for an Ot icwis Club, a Canteen and Store * ouse, together with moorings for a barge. It appears that during the war the Navy put up buildings on a scale considerably larger than was provided^in the original correspondence with the Sultan, but these were held to ce covered by the terms of the War Subsidy Agreement by which the Sultan undertook to give H.M.G. such general facilities as we required in his territory in return for an annual suoaidy of £18 000,This War Subsidy Agreement teramated at the end of 1946 and it is therefore now desirable to re ularise the enjoy ent by the Royal Navy of any facilities at Khor Quwai which they will continue to need beyond the terms of the original Agreement of 1935* 4.

Co'\ 38th April, P)A/1Z^ Hamill ■v&lt; J Aprl 1, The Minister of External Affairs at Muscat raised the question with the Political Agent last month of a British flag, presumably a White Ensign, which was sdid to have been flying at G-hanam Island on Khar ^uwai since January 1943. He asked that the Sultan*s permission should be obtained for it. It will be seen from paragraph 5 of Political Agent Muscat's letter to the Besident No.81/S dated 38th March 1935( a copy of which was forwarded to the G-oveminent of India under express letter No.0/64 of April 2nd 193F) that we have already stated that no flag would be flown, so our position is not a very strong one. 2 . I thought, however, that the flag must be flying for some particular purpose, and probably had some significance in connection with naval signals there, and I therefore asked His Highness in conversation if he frould have any objection to the flag continuing to be flown, provided it was understood that this was simply a war measure. Although His Highness is unduly sensitive in matters of bunting, he readily agreed, but asked that the Political Agent should address him on the subject. This is now being done, and I hope that we shall hear no more about it. I am sending a copy of this letter to the G-overnment of India, the India Office, and the Political Agent, Muscat.

Dear Department, Your despatch No. 685 (E 1795/1795/91) of the 15th April regarding the transfer to Khor Kuwai in the territory of the Sultan of Muscat of part of the naval establishment maintained on the Persian island of Henjam. The Naval Attach^ informs us that the last visit of a French ship to the Persian Gulf announced in the press was that of Rear-Admiral Rivet in the sloop WBougainville 11 in February 1935. Since then the French sloops stationed in the Red See have been occupied in connexion with the Abyssinian war. The next visit to the Persian Gulf is therefore some months overdue and may be expected to take place before the hot weather this year. The Naval Attach^ states that the new developments are not likely to escape the notice of Captain de Villaine, the present head of the French Naval Intelligence, and he considers that it is not improbable that the matter will in due course be brought up for discussion.

He confirmed that his object in writing was merely to get our formal concurrence in what was proposed, and that so far as he could see there could be no objection to the proposal.

My dear Glauson, A few months ago we asked the Commander-in- Ghief Bast Indies to submit the detailed proposals for the small advanced base at Khor Kuwai, and I enclose herewith a copy of his reply. You will note that he is anxious for an early decision as to the removal of the secrecy ban which was imposed last year during the difficult stages of the evacuation. Subject to your concurrence we now propose to inform the Commander-in-Chief that he may approach the Sultan of Muscat through the Political Resident and make the other preliminary enquiries as to labour and materials mentioned in paragraph 3 of Appendix I of the Senior Naval Officer’s Report. We should propose subsequently to examine the detailed proposals from a technical M.J. Glauson, Esq., INDIA 0FRIGS, S.

The Commander-in-Chief has since sent a telegram hastening the reply on this point and we should therefore be grateful if you would treat the matter as immediate. I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Rendel. Yours sincerely?J o q r' f'' ■ s-~ \ .&gt; \~j s^bcHet . KHOR KUWAI. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, No.12/428 of 11th January, 1936. il. No.181/E.I.3273N. The Secretary of the Admiralty. (Copy to The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf). Forwarded for the consideration of Their Lordships concurring generally with the proposals of Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, which appear to be sound and reasonable. 2. I am in complete agreement with Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, remarks in paragraphs 2 and 3. When East Indies letter No.43/E.I.3273E of 28th January 1935 was forwarded, the question of requirements at Khor Euwai was not fully considered, vide paragraph 33 of East Indies letter quoted above. 3. With reference to paragraph 12 of Minute 1 , I concur in the desirability of a small causeway subject to the cost not exceeding the £75 mentioned. 4. With reference to paragrph 2 of Appendix I, it is requested that it may be confirmed by W/T that secrecy is no longer necessary and that His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, may be informed generally, through the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, of the intention to commence building, numbers to live on the island and the fact that they will be armed (vide Sultan's letter of 27th March 1935, forwarded as Enclosure to Admiralty letter under reply). 5. With reference to paragraph 13 of Minute I, it is considered that a Type 52 w/T set would be more suitable than a Type 53 w/T set, owing to the difficulties of maintaining and charging batteries in a hot climate. Provided a suitable generator is selected, which will operate the lights, fans and refrigerator, and provide a source of power for the Type 52 W/T set, the motor generator normally used with this set would not be required, and thus communication with the outside world could be maintained in emergency at little, if any, increase in cost. East Indies, • 10 th February 1936. (Sd) F.F.Rose. Vice Admiral, 0 ommander- in-chief2 • • • SECRET From The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, n-M.S.SHOREHAM at Bahrain. Date ... 11th January 1936. No. 12/428. To ... The Commander-in-Ghief, East indies Station. EHOR KUWAI. The following remarks on Admiralty letter M. 0421/39/35 of 26th October 1935 are forwarded in accordance with your message timed 0922 of 30th December 1935. References. (i) C.in C. E.I T s N0.43/EI.3273E of 28th January 1935. (ii) Chart ro.3452. 1. BUILDINGS. All buildings to be on Salib Peninsula. To consist of:- Officers 1 Club. Canteen with separate building with earth closets. Caretaker and Assistant's Quarters. Native Latrine. Design and construction . Design on the lines stated dm 43/EI. 3273E, App.ll, para.24. Plans for these buildings have been prepared by the Section Officer, R.A.F.Works and Buildings, Basrah, the same type of construction being used as at Bahrain. Some slight alterations to the original sketch plans have been made as the result of experience at Bahrain and these should tend to simplify construction. Siting. It is considered essential that a careful final survey is carried out as recommended by the Section Officer Basrah in App.ll, para.57 of Reference (i) in which he states 'Very great care will have to be exercised in the final siting of the buildings on the Peninsula as the general structure is not entirely satisfactory'. The present Section Officer - Mr.Cox, is prepared to make this final examination subject to the approval of the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Iraq.• • K rnmmm MM 2. INTERNAL FITTINGS. It is considered waste of money putting up these buildings at all unless they can be made reasonably comfortable and inviting. In the original scheme, no provision was made for lights, fans or refrigerators and it is unlikely that much use would be made of Ganteen and Officers' Club during the summer months, when base will be most frequently used , unless these are installed; both officers and ratings are likely to prefer remain ing on board where shade, light, forced ventilation and ice are available, whereas from the health point of view it is most desirable to encourage a change of scene ashore. I consider,, therefore, that the supply of fans, light and refrigerators essential. Enquiries have been made and it would appear that a suitable installation would be a Ijg kw. petrol driven islectric Light set such as produced by the u.E.C., which could be installed complete with internal wiring for about £125. A small shed to house the engine would be required, also refrigerators and overhead fans. An estimate based on Bahrain experience to cover ail these items is £250. 3. jrURNITURE. In the original scheme no provision appears to have been made for furnishing other than at the main base, Bahrain, it is suggested that the essential requirements both for officers' club and Canteen are light osier chairs, tables and a clock, all of which could probably best be obtained in Bombay. I am unable at present to put forward an estimate for the above, but would submit that they should be Admiralty commitments and that I should be given discretionary powers to use a sum up to, say, £100 to purchase what is necessary. 4. IATER. It is proposed to erect 3 in Uo. 500 gallon galvanised iron tanks similar to those provided at Bahrain. These to be placed on a small platform standing on a concrete base and would be made mosquito-proof. No piping would be used. Matting shelter to be built over them as protection from sun. water would be supplied ...supplied from time to time by sloops and in addition a contract would be made for a monthly supply of water by water dhow from Khassab. A water dhow is available at Ahassab and supplies Quoins Light Jiouse periodically. Dhow has a 4u0 gallon wood tank and price is about 30/- a load. This water however cannot be relied on to remain sweet longer than one month. Estimated consumption of local staff is 15 gallons a day. Sloops would normally land their own drinking water when present. A semi rotary pump would be provided for pumping water from dhow to tanks. 5. RECREATIONAL FACILITIES. (a) Bathing . It was originally intended that Ghubna Aarban Bay should be used as a bathing beach for ships f companies. Sharks having several times been observed ib this bay, it is not now considered suitable. Owing to its width, depth of water, irregular bottom and 0 the fact that it is exposed to the prevailing N.W. wind, it is not considered that it could be satisfactorily netted against sharks, without undue expense. Bathing will probably have to be confined to the bays on North and South sides of Salib Peninsula which appear to be shark free, and which can be cleared of coral. (b) Kick-about Ground . The only practical position for this is close to Shubna Karban beach. As this latter has been abandoned for bathing purposes and is a long way from the uanteen, it is improbable that it would be used in summer and seldom in winter. It is not, therefore, proposed that provision of this should be proceeded with, anyway until further experience of requirements has been gained. (c) Tennis court. The only possible position for a court is that shown on the original site plan on Salib Peninsula. Section Officer’s report in App.II, para.20 of Reference (i) is quoted here for convenience. 'This is the only area that could be adapted for this purpose, and even here the ground level renders the cost of construction relatively heavy. As this ground is a natural • •.natural surface drainage area, the court would have to be protected by channels dug round its edges. The construction would be muttee. it is feared that the mud for this would have to be imported as nothing of this nature was seen on the island”. This muttee mud would have to come from Basrah or Bahrain, it is considered, therefore, that the question of construction of this court should be deferred until further experience of requirements and possibilities has been obtained. G-ames are not normally played between 15th July and 30th October. IXAGSTAFF. As no flag is t o be flown, no necessity for this arises, since type 53 tf/T set has its own aerial and posts. j'UEL. it is preposed that one oil fuel barge should be maintained at jsiior Auwai, moorings would be laid by a sloop. Barge to contain fuel oil, bagged coal for use of sloops, diesel oil and a small supply of petrol for use of sloops and electric light plant. A small enclosed lock-up store to be fitted for the latter on the upper deck at the after end of the oil barge - a simple undertaking. Capacity - iuu in i\io.4 gallon tins. All the above fuel could be replenished from time to time by KHUZISTAN” without the necessity of a sloop being present as at Bahrain. it is proposed that suitable locks should be fitted to the pump house and fore and after compartments in oil barge, it is also proposed that no crew should be maintained aboard the oil barge, as there is nothing to pilfer on the upper deck and the barge would be in the full view of the caretaker and assistants from their quarters. Oil barge net to be moved to Khor kuwai until the caretaker and assistants have been installed. &amp;■ ASSISTA NTS. It is proposed that there should be one caretaker and four assistants and that these should be Arab subjects of the sultan of Muscat; suitable men being obtained through the Political Agent, Muscat. TheirTheir duties would be the care, maintenance and improve ments of base as directed, meeting mail steamers and transporting stores from them, maintenance and attendance at oil barge as requisite. They will require a boat, and as tidal stream sets strongly through the nhor it is not considered that less than four men could be employed to manage the boat and do the work required. In accordance with n.H. the Sultan’s wishes they would be armed with rifles, probably purchased locally and a small stock of ammunition, which would be mustered periodically by sloops and an Bxplanation required of any rounds used. The caret^Ker would be held responsible for the safety of the goats on the island in accordance with the wishes expressed in the sultan's letter. It is hoped to obtain a caretaker for Hupees two per diem and the a ssistants for wupee one per diem, but this may have to be exceeded. STORES. under peace conditions it is proposed that an arrange ment be made with the representative of the s.I.S.N.Co. at Bombay for 'Up slow’ mails to call at Khor kuwai as and when required as an additional periodic call port OR their present itinerary, and that mails, fruit and potatoes should be delivered there for sloops present or working in the soutern section. Reference (i) para.34. In the absence of sloop concerned these would be collected by the caretaker and his assistants and stowed temporarily in the Canteen. Quarterly stores, victualling and canteen stores should be sent to Bahrain. ■BUAx.. it is considered that a small native craft would be more suitable than a service boat, since Arabs will be at home in it and not so many men would be required to handle it. Three men would be required to handle a service skiff in the tideway and would hold t the best half a ton of stores, whereas a small native craft worked by three men would be capable of dealing with© 3 ^- tons of stores, ‘fhe price second hand would be about £ 20 . This latter craft is proposed. 11. NAVIGATIONAL AID . It is proposed that a small stone cairn should be erected on the end of has Salib; cairn having a short pole in centre wired and fitted with a red electric light bulb capable of being switched on and off as required. This would be a help to sloops entering at night and is thought would be sufficient for 'KHUZISTAN”; but it is not anticipated that B.I.Steamers would enter at night under any circumstances. Reference (i), para.35. 12. oAUSMAY. At presnat from one hour either side of jl.W. springs a nothing larger than/skiff can scrape acroes the reef which prevents access to the landing beach, uoral will have to be cleared from this reef to make a wide deep water channel. Pulling boats will then be able to land on the beach at all states of the tide but power boats never. After experience at Bahrain it is estimated that a short 50 feet causeway can be constructed with coolie labour from stone available on Salib peninsula and from cleared coral. This would cost approximately £75 and not £175 as previously stated. It is considered that this causeway is most desirable; it will facilitate landing of building stores, thus saving time and money, will facilitate landing of weekly stores, will enable power boats to have access to shore for three hours either side of hish water, will facilitate landing of personnel and in the event of base being put on a war footing will enable war stores etc. to be landed until a more ambitious causeway can be built. 1 would propose that this short causeway be built, as being well worth the money. 13. OOMiviUim 1 LLxTlONS . A simple system of single flag hoists to communicate requirements or sloops to the caretaker is proposed. A Type 53 W/T set has been received in SHORjEHAM and win be available to be landed at the base if and when require, it could be stowed when not in use in one of the buildings and arrangements could • •.could be made to accommodate crew in canteen should they have to be left ashore in the absence of a sloop. This is rather more a matter for future consideration. A w/T hut should not be required. 14. ESTIMATES. An amended estimate is enclosed - Appendix il - embodying all the proposals put forward in this letter. It is preferred not to attempt to amend the estimates for buildings put forward previously cy the section officer, Works and buildings, irqq. There are at present so many unknown factors such as the cost of obtaining suitable labour hire of dhow transport for them, maintaining them on the island with food and water, the cost and method of transporting materials from various places to the island, and the time factor, none of which can be ascertained until preliminary enquiries can be made, in this connection I would refer to Appendix il, paragraphs 32 and 33 of Keference (i).

Supervision . Tentative arrangements have already been made with the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters, Iraq for a reliable Indian supervisor to carry out the work when required. The man earmarked has considerable experience in working on his own with direct labour, and in this case he will be working to detailed plans prepared by Works and Buildings, R.A.F., Basrah. Monthly visits of a British supervisor should not be necessary. A sloop would attend at Khor Kuwai as much as possible in a similar manner to that carried out at Bahrain. It will be necessary to give the Chief Engineer, Air Headquarters as long notice as possible of approximate date supervisor will be required. 2* Secrecy . Instructions contained in the last sentence of Admiralty message to C.in C., E.I. (340) timed 1725/27th March 1935, state that ’’Khor Kuwai should not repetition not be publicly mentioned at this stage.” As far as I am aware this ban has not been lifted. Request I may be informed by signal when seerecy is no longer necessary in order that preliminary investigations as to supply of labour and materials can be made. 3* Labour . It is proposed to obtain some of the masons and craftsmen and all the coolies from Muscat territory. A certain number of coolies are available at Khassab, which is only 12 miles distant. The Naval Contractor at Muscat has been sounded and he appears to be ready to supply, transport and maintain coolies to any part of the Gulf required. Cost could not be ascertained owing to secrecy ban on place involved. Reference has been made frequently in the past to the few skilled craftsmen available at Bahrain sind it is probable that the extra men needed will have to be obtained from Iraq.Page 3. Time Table ', (a) It is proposed that the preliminary inspection of building sites, stone to be used and arrangements for labour referred to above should be made as soon as practicable after SHOREHAM’s return to the Gulf and in conjunction with a time suitable to Chief Engineer, Iraq.. It is anticipated that this could be carried out early in April* (b) That materials should be landed at Khor Kuwai about and of April, by which time v/eather should be suitable. (c) That building work should commence in May as soon as practicable.APP.III Page 1. KJiOR KUWAI A-'P-jH'IDIX III to Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf’s No. 12/428 of 11th January 1936.
