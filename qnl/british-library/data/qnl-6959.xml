Aiticle 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations reads thus:— Article u.u. io tliose colonies and territories which, as a consequence of the J ate war, have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly go\ ei ned them, and which are^ inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by them selves imdt i the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation, and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant. The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf of the League. The character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions and other similar circumstances. Certain communities, formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire, have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory. -S- * In every case of mandate, the Mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in reference to the territory committed to its charge. The degree of authority, control or administration to 'be exercised by the Mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council. A permanent Commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annual reports of the Mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the mandates. (A portion of Article 22, relating only to such territories as Central Africa and the Pacific Islands, has been omitted.) 2. The Anglo-French Declaration of 8th November 1918 says ^ The end which France and Great Britain have in view in their prosecution in the East of the war let loose by German ambition is the complete and definite liberation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks and the estab .ishmen National Governments and Administrations drawing their authority from the mi la i\e and free choice of indigenous populations. _ 'Rritqin are aoreed In order to give effect to these intentions France and Great Britain are a &amp; ieea 10 1866 60 7.20 A' 11 9 whose liberation they are endeavouring to effect and to recognise the latter as soon as they shall be effectively established. Far from wishing to impose any particular institutions on these lands, they have no other care but to assure by their support and effective aid the normal working of the Governments and Administrations which they shall have adopted of their own free will. To ensure impartial and equal justice, to facilitate economic development by encouraging indigenous initiative, to foster the spread of education and to put an end to the divisions too long exploited by Turkish policy : such is the role which the two Allied Governments assume in the liberated territories. 3. Conditions to he fulfilled before the wishes of the people can he ascertained. We think it necessary that an attempt should be made to ascertain what the wishes of the people are, but we consider that before this can be done with hope of success :— (а) The mandate must be granted. (б) The government of the country must be carried on for a short time under a provisional constitution to allow the country to settle down after the • disturbances caused by the war. 4. Wishes of the people to he expressed hij an elected Legislative Assembly. It appears to us that there would be very great difficulty in ascertaining the wishes of the people immediately the mandate has been granted ; and it is considered that the body which is to give its opinion on a matter of such moment as the constitution should have an opportunity to see constitutional government at work for ^a short time and to realise the consequences of any decision they may give. It is therefore proposed that the opinon of the Legislative Assembly (as described below) on the constitution should be ascertained, but not necessanlv immediately. It should be stated, as soon as the proposals for the elections to the Assembly are published the Assembly will be invited, not later than the third session, to discuss the constitution (within the limits imposed by the terms of the mandate), and that until then the government of the country will be carried on under the provisional constituiion outlined below. It would be advisable to retain for the High Commissioner the power to dissolve the lirst Assembly and to put the constitutional issue before its successor. 5. Framing oj a suitable form of Government. There is no difficulty in framing a constitution on paper. In Turkish times there was a complete constitution on paper, but many of its provisions were disregarded. The difficulty lies m framing a form of government which, while giving real power to the native element, will yet hold out reasonable prospects of maintaining peace, law and liberty, and this can only be done if safeguards are introduced. \ e are of opinion that where a native of the country can be found capable of filling an administrative post, he should be employed in preference to anv other person. We are also of opinion that on this canon it will soon be possible to emnlov more natives of the country than hitherto, and in higher posts. 6. Conditions laid down for the Constitution. folloJs:- COnditi0nS : hich the Coastitution must may be summarised as (a) Subject to the tutelage of a Mandatory Power the Government must be an indigenous Government. (b) The form of government must be adopted by the free will of the people subiect to such powers as are necessary to enable the Mandatory Power to perform its mandate. J (c) The constitution must contain the necessary securities to enable the . andatory lower to perform the trlist confided to it, of ensuring the well-being and development of the people. This implies the maintenance ot peace and order. Mandate should he granted soon. tti n ^^ iecommend that a mandate should be granted at the earliest iwsssihlA Following the wording of the Covenant of the League o'ioTs M mandate wdl presumably be to entrust to the Mandatory Power the 'tutele-e of Mesopotamia to be exercised by them on behalf ot the 'League We consider b desirable that the mandate should state that the Mandatory Power is vested with th* necessary powers to carry out the mandate, to secure (in the word V f th P the well-being and development of the people.'

(6) The President of the Council to have a vote only in case of equality of votes. (7) The High Commissioner to have the power of overruling the decision of the majority of the Council, and thereupon the decision of the High Commissioner to be deemed for all purposes the decision of the Council. 1866 A 2(8) The Council of State to be the chief executive authority of the State. State executive decisions, and executive decisions of the various departments issued to the public, should be issued in the name of the Council of State. (9) The British Secretary of a Department, to begin with, to be the c ^ 11 ® executive official of the Department. Arab Members of Council to be attached to various departments, to be consulted by the Secretary on all matters of importance and to have access to all departmental papers, and to have the right to refer to the Council of State anv difterence of opinion between themselves and the Secretaries. Other departments (except perhaps some of the technical departments ^ Public Works), in which there were no Arab Members of Council, would yet ordmanlj have Arab advisers or assistants. i ^ i r ^ t • i ^ aO) Arab Members of Council not to be necessarily selected from the Legislative Assembly but to be ex-officio members of the Assembly with the right to vote. British Secretaries of Departments and other heads of Departments to have the power to attend the Legislative Assembly and to speak, but not to vote. 13. Legislative Assembly. Constitution. ^ , n i , . , (lj We think it necessary that the legislative body either be ejected, or, whicli seems to us preferable, appointed by local bodies who will themselves be elected. This would, however, not apply to the Arab members of the Council of State, who, we have advised, should be ex-officio members of the Legislative Assembly. The present Divisional Councils are in fact probably more representative of the people than they would be under a system of election, but as they are nominated bodies a Legislative Council elected by them would be open to the objection that they were the nominees of the British authorities. The method of election requires further study and consultation with local authorities, and we are not * in a position to submit final recommendations; but we submit in the Appendix methods of election which, subject to modifications to suit local requirements, we believe to be practicable. (2) The exact composition of the Legislative Assembly also requires further study. We suggest provisionally it should include :— • (а) Elected members for the towns and country districts approximately pro portionate to their population on the basis of one to 50,000 inhabitants; (б) Elected members representing the Jewish and Christian communities ; (c) Arab members of the Council of State, who, as we have already advised, should be ex-officio members. (3) On the above lines we calculate that the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly, including the ex-officio members of the Council of State, would work out at about 50. (4) The President of the Legislative Council should be an Arab nominated by the Council of State. He should not necessarily be an elected member, as it may perhaps be found that among the elected members there is no suitable candidate for the post. (5j British Secretaries of Departments should have the right to attend the Assembly and to speak and introduce measures but not to vote. (6) There should be a British Joint Secretary to the Assembly to assist in matters of procedure. (7) Members of the Legislative Assembly would receive a fixed allowance per session. 14. Functions of legislative Assembly. (1) Laws to be issued and taxes imposed by the Council of State:— (а) normally with the concurrence of the Legislative Council; (б) but if the Assembly refuse to pass the law in the way desired by the Council of State, the Council of State, after conferences and again submitting the law, to have power to issue without their consent. We consider it essential that the Council of State should in case of necessity have power to pass laws without the concurrence of the Legislative Assembly. (c) There might be a provision that Bills submitted to the Assembly, if not rejected before prorogation, may be deemed to have been passed. (2) As under the Turkish Constitution, the Council of State to have power to issue temporary laws, which, however, must be submitted to the next session of the Legislative Assembly. (3) Private members to have power to initiate legislation, except as regards constitutional matters and taxation.mternal government of IjeropotCZ'' If G^mudo 8 ^ t0 1Uatter8 explain reasons.

Method of Election to Legislative Assembly. Method A.—(1) Members for towns large enough to be represented by one or more members to be elected by the Municipal Councils. Such Municipal Councils to be themselves elected by tax-paying male householders approximately in accordance with the Turkish Municipal Law of 5th October 1887. (2) Members for the Divisions to be elected by Divisional Councils, excluding the members of the Divisional Council for towns which elect their own member to the Legislative Assembly, or (if it is thought advisable) by separate panels formed out of the Divisional Council representing respectively tribesmen and non-tribesmen. The Divisional Councils to be themselves elected. The method of the election to Divisional Councils requires further study. It is thought that in districts where the tribal system is still in force (and this includes much the greater part of the country) the representative of such districts should be elected by the headmen of the tribal sub-sections. These tribal headmen are the chief men of the smallest tribal territorial unit. They are themselves elected by the tribesmen under them, and they elect the Shaikh of the tribe subject to confirmation by the authorities. In areas where the tribal system is not in force the problem is more difficult. Such areas may include small towns, villages and in a few places a scattered resident population. I.li the small towns there would be no difficulty in forming municipalities in accordance with the Turkish law. In villages and areas with a scattered population, councils of elders for the village or area (nahiyah), which were supposed to exist under Turkish law, but which in practice rarely did exist in Mesopotamia, might be formed. The municipalities of the small towns and the village and 'nahiyah' councils might appoint delegates in numbers proportionate to their inhabitauts, and such delegates could meet togethei and elect the member of the Divisional Council. ' 1 We think a system of selection on the above lines is best suited to the require ments of the tribal areas. It could not, however, be brought into force immediate!} r6 for some of the present Divisional Councils, which are nominated bodies have only been recently formed, and to dismiss them at once would rouse the resentment of members, many of whom have done useful work and deserve well of us. It is necessary therefore to have an alternative method. Method B.—(1) Members for towns large enough to be represented by one or more members to be elected by the municipal electors. i + ^ (2) Members for districts where the tribal system is in iorce to be elected b} tne tribal headmen or by delegates appointed by such headmen. • . • p (3) Small towns and villages, and areas where the tribal system is not m lorce, to be grouped together. The municipalities of such small towns and the village or district councils to choose delegates proportional to their number, who would meet and elect their member. 2. Qualifications for Candidates of Legislative Assembly. (1) Age, say 30. (2) Must pay a fixed sum in direct taxation in the constituency, or must own immovable property of a fixed value therein.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000331_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B343</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000331</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B343</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Mesopotamian constitution.
