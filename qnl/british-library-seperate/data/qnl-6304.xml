                           Lupinin February 1930 (the Lupin Conference) the King of Iraq (Faisal I) had given an assurance to the King of Hejaz and Najd (ibn Saud) that Farhan bin Mashur would return to ibn Saud via Syria subject to a pardon. However, ibn Mashur was allegedly abducted on the way through Syria and this was seen as a broach of Faisal's guarantee to Ibn Saud.The King of Iraq offered to hand over Ibn Mashur's family and property to the King of Hejaz and Najd as a gesture of good faith, a measure which was accepted by Ibn Saud.The discussion in the volume between British officials concerns the practicalities of the case and the need to maintain cordial relations between the two monarchs. It also discusses the agreements at the Lupin conference and implications for British action in this matter.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Secretary to the High Commissioner for Iraq (R S M Sturges); the Private Secretary to the King of Iraq, Baghdad (Abdullah Beg al Haj); the King of Iraq, (Faisal bin Hussein); the High Commissioner for Iraq (F H Humphrys); the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Sidney James Webb, Lord Passfield); the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonial Office; the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Government of Hejaz and Najd; HBM Minister, Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); and the King of Hejaz and Najd (ibn Saud).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Private Secretary to the King of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Monarchy</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Saudi Arabia, Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Sultan of Najd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Syria</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Najd</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00010c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00010c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00010c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
