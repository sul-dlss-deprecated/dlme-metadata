It seems that some years ago, before the system of incineration was intro duced, there actually was a considerable trade in cofiQn-w ood and labads and in the cotton-wool many bodies are wrapped in. Later an attempt w r as made to disinfect them before selling, and the concession for such disinfection was given to an individual, w ho paid £T. 200 for a three months' concession. But^ still later, owing to the abuses that arose, this was put a stop to and the system of burning introduced. The Commission definitely condemned a return to the former system. The practical difficulties in the way of properly disinfecting a large number of coffins and labads would be great; abuses w ould be certain to arise, and inci neration is obviously the only proper fate for such objects. When it is remem bered that most of the bodies brought in coffins are “ fresh ” ones, that the coffin would must be fouled with discharges from these bodies, and that, if sold, it would be made not only into furniture but also into boxes in which rice, fruit, flour and other eatables are exposed for sale in the bazars, the necessity for such a conclusion becomes obvious. The bodies remain in the morgue until the ceremonial washing, the pay ment of taxes and other formalities are completed. It is forbidden to take any body into a house in the town ; but many pilgrims—notably those from Baku, already mentioned—are so attached to their relatives’ remains, that nothing will prevent them taking these with them into the towm. # The majority of bodies—from 80 to 85 per cent, of the whole—before being interred, are carried to the mosque in the centre of the town, where they make the tour of the Sahn-i-Sherif, or principal court of the mosque. This ceremony is the equivalent, for the deceased, of a ziaret, or religious visitation during life. The hamals (porters) wTio carry the bodies are paid a sum which varies from one or tw 7 o piastres up to one or two Turkish pounds (one Turkish pound is of the value of 18 shillings), according to the w ealth and generosity of those accompanying them. If the relations come w ith the body, they generally carry it themselves round the mosque. In the case of dry bodies, several are usually thus carried together, in large coffins lent by the defnieh. After the ziaret and other formalities are accomplished, the bodies are finally interred either in the serdabs around the mosque, in one of the many private tombs which are found scattered through the town of Nejef, or in the great cemetery outside the town. The Nejef cemetery extends into the desert to the north and east of the town walls. The tombs cover an area of about. 2,400 metres in length and 800 metres in width. This area is not surrounded by any wall or railing, and each year it tends to stretch farther and farther into the desert. It contains many thousands of tombs, many of which are merely small mounds of earth or stones, while others have a small brick or stone cupola over them, and still others take the form of small mosques, of considerable size, richly ornamented with coloured tiles and paintings, with inscriptions in Persian or Arabic. Several, of these large tombs are built in the middle of a garden, surrounded by a wall, and not infrequently there is a house of some size in the same enclosure, where the relations of the deceased may spend the day, or even reside for several days. Between the cemetery and the w alls of the town, there has grow r n up a mound, some 30 or 40 feet in height, entirely formed of the earth thrown up in excavating the tombs inside the town, alluded to above. The burial taxes have already been mentioned ; they are called defnieh or turrabieh taxes. The right to collect them is usually conceded by the Evkaf (or inistry of pious foundations) to some private person. The actual conces sionaire is (in 1914) a Jewish inhabitant of Bagdad, who had paid the sum of £T. 13,000 (£11,700 sterling) for a concession lasting three years, covering the interments both at Kerbela and Nejef. His predecessor had paid £T. 22,000 for a concession also of three years, but at that time the bodies of Turkish subjects were not exempted from the taxes, as they were later. Por burial in the Nejef cemetery, whether of fresh or dry bodies, the defnieh tax was 50 piastres ( 85 . 4d.), with an additional charge of 10 piastres,32 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS the proceeds of which were destined for the construction of a hospital in the town. The bodies of Turkish subjects are exempted from the P. 50 tax, and pay only that of P. 10. At Kerbela the tax is only P. Z0 plus the P. 10 for the hospital. It may he mentioned that at Kerbela a fairly gocd hospital has already been built with the proceeds of this tax, and that it is of real use to the pilgrims visiting that town ; hut at Nejef nothing has yet been done with the revenue from the P. 10 tax. Burial in the precincts of the mosque is naturally much more costly than in the cemetery, and the chaige varies according to the position of the tomb. In the annexed plan of the mosque of Nejef, the different portions of the precincts are shown. In the centre is the reputed tomb of Ali, around which is the enclosure known as the Hadra; there are no tombs here. Surrounding this again is the space known as the Htvak-i-Shnif, or inner court of the mosque, which is regarded as the most sacred portion for Shiah burials. Around this is the Sahn-i-Sherif, or great outer court of the mosque, which in its turn is surrounded by walls, against which are a series of arched recesses and chambers, similar to those found round the court of a great caravanserai. These are known as the Aivan ve Oda. Finally, at one extremity of the Revak-i-Sherif is a space called the Tarma, or Heuak- Tarmassi. In all these divisions the ground is covered with large paving-stones, underneath which are the serdabs, or excavations in which the bodies are deposited. The Rcvok-i-Sherif of Nejef contains, it is said, about 100 serdabs, under its pavement and around its w alls. Many of them are of large size and deep, seme measuring 6 or 8 or more metres in length and many metres in depth. The charge for interment here is £T.60 (£54 sterling) and consequently the number of bodies buried here is small. The haffar-lashi, or head grave-digger, informed me that only four persons had been buried here in .the five preceding years, and interments in the Kevak-i-Sherif of the mosques in the other Shiah cities are apparently equally rare. At Kerbela the charge for burial in this portion of the mosque is only £T.12J (about £11). The Sahn-i-Sherif of Nejef contains several hundred tombs. Their exact number could not be ascertained, but they w r ere estimated at something between 500 and 800. They are smaller than in the R,evak-i-Sherif, but they are deep, and each is large enough to receive 9 or 10 or more bodies. The charge for burial here is P.200 to P.250 (£1-13-4 to £2-1-8). The number of burials in the 8ahn-i-Sherif at Nejef is from 200 to 300 a year. At Kerbela the charge for burial in this poition of the mosque is only £T.l (18s.). The Akan ve Oda, or arched recesses and chambers, number 14 on each &amp;ide of the court, and one in each corner, or 60 in all. Bach contains from 4 to 10 serdabs, and each serdab can receive 10, 15 or 20 bodies. The charge tor interment here varies between P.250 and P.500 (£2-1-8 to £4-3-4), and Sometimes is as dear as P.1,000 or P.1,200 (£8 to £10). At Kerbela the charge for burial in this portion of the mosque precincts is only £T.li. Finally, the Tarma or Revak-Tarmassi contains only some 15 (some say 20) serdabs, but they are of great size, and can receive 20 or 30 and even 50 bodies each. The charge for burial here is P.500 (£4-3-4) at Nejef and £T.3 (£2-14-0) at Kerbela. The serdabs are, as just stated, covered over with paving stones, w hich are more or less cemented down after each interment. They are, it is said, mere unlined excavations in the earth. The bodies or packets of bones are laid in them without coffins or wrappings, side by side if there is space enough, or one on top of the other if there is not. They are rarely buried in the earth at the bottom of the serdab, except at Samara, where, it is said, such true burial is not uncommon. Exact data are wanting as to the number of bodies buried in the mosques or cemeteries. The system of registration is very imperfect, and many burials escape registration altogether. The figures given below were furnished by the health offices of Nejef and Kerbela respectively : the true figures would piobably be considerably higher.
