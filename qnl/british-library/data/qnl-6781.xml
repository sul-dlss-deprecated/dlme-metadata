Your telegram No. 233 of .'&gt;lst October. Following from Lord Kitchener. Lord Kitchener's salaam to the Sherif Abdalla. Germany has bought the Turkish Government with gold, notwithstanding that Fngland, France and Russia guaranteed integrity of the Ottoman Empire if Turkey remained neutral in this war. The Turkish Government have against the wish of the Sultan through German pressure committed acts of war by invading the frontiers of Egypt with armed bands followed by Turkish soldiers which are now massed at Akaba to invade Egypt. If the Arab nation assist England in this war that has been forced upon us by Turkey, England will guarantee that no internal intervention takes place in Arabia and will give the Arabs every assistance against external foreign aggression. It may be that an Arab oL' the true race will assume the Caliphate at Mecca or Medina and so good may come by the help of God out of all evil which is now occurring. s. :«);&gt;.4.—Comnuinication from Mr. Chectham to Shcrif Abdulla. After compliments and thanks. We liave understood your reasons and acknowledge the justice of your request. So we have sent to Lord Kitchener (titles) who has replied as follows :— Salaams to Sherif Abdalla ^titles). That which we foresaw lias come to pass. Germany lias bought the Turkish Government with gold notwith standing that Great Britain, France and Russia guaranteed the integrity of the Ottoman Empire if Turkey remained neutral in this war. The Turkish Government have against the wish of the Sultan and through German pressure committed acts of war by invading without provocation the frontiers of Egypt with armed bands followed by Turkish soldiers which are now massed at Akaba to invade Egypt, so that the cause of the Arabs, which is the cause of freedom, has become the cause also of Great Britain. If tin? Amir (titles) and Arabs in general assist Great Britain in this conflict that has been forced upon us by Turkey, Great Britain will promise not to intervene in any manner whatsoever whether in things religious or otherwise. Moreover, recognising and respecting the sacred and unique ollice of the Amir llosayn (titles) Great Britain will guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Sherifate against all external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans. Till now we have defended and befriended Islam in the person of the Turks : henceforward it shall be in that of the noble Arab. It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Caliphate at Mecca or Medina, and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil which is now occurring. It would be well if Your Highness could convey to your followers and devotees, who are found throughout the world, in every country, the good tidings of the Freedom of the Arabs, and the rising of the sun over Arabia. 5.—Communication, unsigned and undated, handwriting of Sherif Abdalla. Respectable and powerful Friend, After paying due respects, yours of the 12th Zil lioga has been received with due honour and reverence, and we have taken it as a basis for action and a reference for the present and the future. In accordance with it, and in view of its fidelity and accord, our country has come to hold most conscientiously to your suggestions, and has undertaken to carry out faithfully what we said in our previous letter and what we confirm in the present one ; and has avoided since our foregoing letter all that affects unfavourably your material and moral interests. Yea more, we are endeavouring to discourage any man who seeks to harm these interests— any one of those who are outside the pale of the Hedjaz colony. If you could perceive our critical position in undertaking the matler you would know that we are doing that which is more important than the performance of that which is naturally imposed upon us, regardless of whether or not these negotiations take place and whether or not an agree ment is arrived at. It is so because religion which justifies it and which is the scle foundation of action, prevents us from working at once. But when the time shall come, and it is not far distant, we can not but accomplish it, even though the Ottoman Empire be not occupied and even though it should muster against us all its army. In closing, 1 would remind you that we act upon the words of him who said, 41 Perform ye the promise ye make to God when ye pledge yourselves.' We then pay to His Highness and yourself our best regards, requesting you to keep this correspondence secret until the right time should come.().--Shorthand Note taken by Messenger ol ;i discourse by the Sherif of Mecca, which took place in privacy at night on the roof of his palace. Ali Hey, please impart my best salaams, faithfulness and friendship to Mr. Storrs, and ray acceptance of what his great Empire has on another occasion proposed. Ali, do your best to make Mr. Storrs understand that he should not consider my answer as a breaking up of relations. It simply came late, and if she had granted our demand when we made it, things would have been better. The day will come when we Avill demand more of her than she is now preparing for us, and perhaps soon. Ali, inform Mr. Storrs that 1 am using all my political and material influence in spreading the British policy (influence) in my country as well in that of A1 Imam Yehia, as he is ray friend and never acts against ray advice. Ali, Turkey is weighing down heavily upon us, beyond the power of our endurance. We therefore oppose the execution of its commands and plans. Yesterday they were planning to send printed circulars or posters to the chiefs of the tribes for distribution among the pilgrims. \Ve oppose the project with all our might and diplomacy; we have opposed it almost to the point ol' breaking up our relation with them) ; and if the Vali had not returned upon his decision, relations woidd have been definitely broken up. And perhaps causes might spring up which would break these relations even before you arrive at your country ; and it might come to pass that the thing would be delayed some three or four or six months. Through ray political influence, rebellion and disobedience had well nigh broken out among the Syrian corps. England will hear about 1113* action, if not now, in the future. Our relations with the Empire are waning, dying, even as a flickering lamp whose oil had run out. Ali, the only thing that prevents ine from rising against the Turkish Empire is the Moslem world, which now looks upon me and feels annoyed with me, especially under the present circumstances. Another reason is this, I cannot forget the favours the reigning house bestowed upon me. But the reins of power have passed from the hands of this family. Among the reasons which strengthen the hands of the Turkish statesmen and give weight to their influence and power is the interception of food materials from our land. This thing has caused great want there. More, they (Turks) have informed the people and the Bedouins that it was Britain which intercepted the alms and thus reduced them to their pitiable state. Ali Bey, we wrestle valiantly, spend much of our substance, and use all our influence to calm down the country. (Ireat Britain will learn of our efforts later on. Now we cannot make demands; we simply pray her to facilitate the question of grains (the coining in of grains). Be it as it may we shall not turn against her or aid her enemies. She shall see. f am bound by three ties; the Caliphate, and, as 1 have already intimated, the favours which the reigning house bestowed upon me. As to the religious tie, you see them now declare openly that the cause of the degeneration of the Moslem nations is religion, and they set themselves to efface it. Yea, some have come to us to pay a visit to the Holy Places (on pilgrimage); and these have mocked and scoffed at the thing, and have not performed their religious duties as it behoves thein to do. From this you w r ill perceive that religious matters have become lax. Therefoie we are no longer bound to obey them. The second tie concerns our obedience to the Caliphate, but there no longer exists a Caliphate, and that for v;irious reasons, among others that their rule projects plans and deeds that are all contrary to religion. The Caliphate- means this, that the rules of the book of God should be enforced, and this they do not do. As to the third, I have already intimated that the Turkish Government has come to be nothing more than Enver and his clique. We therefore are no longer bound to them by any tie.Notwithstanding this ] am of opinion that it will be better now to put ofl' action. This is due to the reasons explained here above, and to the fact that it will be in our interests that this delay be. Say, Ali, are yon satisfied ? Yes, sir. 7. Comimmication from Sherif of Mecca to Mr. Storrs, Oriental Secretary to British Representative, Cairo. To the dear honourable, may God protect him, I present to your dear hononr my affectionate regards and respects, and hope that you will do your best to make the enclosed note, containing the proposed conditions, effective, as you are capable of doing. And in this connection \ declare to you and your Government that you need not be anxious about the ideas of the people here, because they are closely bound to your Government by community of interests. Do not be at pains to send aeroplanes or men-of-war to throw reports and rumours, as was done before, because the matter is now decided. What we desire to beg you is to open the way for the Egyptian Govern ment to send the charitable offerings of corn for the Holy lands. I.e., Mecca and Medina, which were stopped since last year. For verily, the sending of this grain for this year and last would be an important factor in laying the foundations of our mutual advantage. This should suffice for a person of your grasp. In conclusion 1 offer you my best salaams and respects. ^nd Ramadan 1333 (14th July 1015). Kindly do not trouble to send any correspondence until you see the result of our operations; except the reply to the note and its enclosure, which should be through the bearer only; and, if you should think fit, give him a written token to make it easy for him to reach you when we find it necessary. He is all right. Unsigned. S.—Enclosed with forefiroino 1 . o o To his Honour, W hereas the whole ol the Arab nation without any exception have decided in these last years to live, and to accomplish their freedom and grasp the reins of their Administration both in theory and practice ; and whereas they have found and felt that it is to the interest of the Government of Great Britain to support them and aid them to the attainment of their firm and lawful intentions (which are based upon the maintenance of the honour and dignity oJ their lile) without any ulterior motives whatsoever unconnected with this object; And whereas it is to their (Arabs ) interest also to prefer the assistance of the Government of Great Britain in consideration of their geographical position and economic interests, and also of the attitude of the above- mentioned Government, which is known to both nations and therefore need not be emphasized ; kor these reasons the Arab nation sees fit to limit themselves, as time is short, to asking the Government of Great Britain, if it should think fit, for the approval, through her deputy or representative, of the following- fundamental propositions, leaving out all things considered secondary in comparison with these, so that it may prepare all means necessary for attaining this noble purpose, until such time as it finds occasion for making the actual negotiations :— h irstly. —England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by Mersina-Adana up to the 37 c of latitude, on which degree fails Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island, up to the border of Persia ; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf ol Basra ; on the south by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of theposition of Aden to remain .'is it is ; on the west by the Keil Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina. England to approve of the pruclamatiuii ol an Arab Caliphate of Islam. Sccoiiillif. —The Arab Government of the Sherif to acknowledge that lOngland shall have the preference in all economic enterprises in the Arab countries whenever conditions of enterprises are otherwise equal. ThirdLij. -For the security of this Arab independence and the certainly of such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to offer mutual assistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties. Fourthly. — If one of the parties enters upon an aggressive conllict, the other party to assume a neutral attitude, and in case of such party wishing the other to join forces, both to meet and discuss the conditions. Fi ftfihf. — England to acknowledge the abolition of foreign privileges in the Arab countries, and to assist the Government of the Sherif in an international Convention for confirming such abolition. Slxtldij. —Articles 3 and -l of this Treaty to remain in vigour for 15 years, and, if either wishes it to be renewed, one year's notice before lapse of treaty to be given. Consequently, and as the whole of the Arab nation have (praise be to God) agreed and united for the attainment, at all costs and linally, of this noble object, they beg the Government of Great Britain to answer them, positively or negatively in a period of 30 days after receiving this intimation ; and if this period should lapse before they receive an answer, they reserve to themselves complete freedom of action. Moreover we (Sherif's family) will consider ourselves free in word and deed from the bonds of our previous declaration which we made through Ali EIT.* Undated and unsigned. I).—From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif llosayn (titlesj. After compliments and salutations. We have the honour to thank you for your frank expressions of the sincerity of your feeling towards England. We rejoice moreover that Vour Highness and your people are of one opinion, that Arab interests are English interests and English Arab. To this intent we contirm to you the terms of Lord Kitchener s message, which reached you by the hand of Ali Etlendi, and in which was stated clearly our desire for the independence of Arabia and its inhabitants, together with our approval of the Arab Caliphate when it should be proclaimed. We declare once more that His Majesty's Government would welcome the resumption of the Caliphate by an Arab of true race. With regard to the questions of limits, frontiers and boundaries, it would appear to be premature to consume our time in discussing such details in the heat of war, and while, in many portions of them, the Turk is up to now in ell'ectivc occupation; especially as we have learnt, with surprise and regret, that some of the Arabs in those very parts, far from assisting us, are neglecting th^ their supreme oppor tunity, and are lending their arms to tiie German and the Turk, to the new despoiler and the old oppressor. Nevertheless we are ready to send to Vour Highness for the Holy Cities and the noble Arabs the charitable offerings of Egypt, so soon as Vour lliizhness shall inform us how and where they should be delivered. We are O ^ # moreover arranging for this your messenger to be admitted and helped on any journey he may make to ourselves. Friendly reassurances. Salutations. (Signed) Sit: A. 11. M c M ahon. (Apparently dated 30th August 1915.) s. yu2.10. Conimunication from the Grand Sherif of Mecca to His Excellency the Most Kxalted, the Most Imminent, the Hritish High Commissioner in Egypt; may God grant him success. With great cheerfulness and delight 1 received your letter dated 19th Shawal 1333 (3(&gt;tli August 1915), and have given it great consideration and regard, in spite of the impression 1 received from it of ambiguity and its tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our essential point. It is necessary to make clear to Your Excellency our sincerity towards the illustrious British Empire and our confession oL' preference for it in all cases and matters and under all forms and circumstances. The real interests of the followers of our religion necessitate this. Nevertheless, Your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that the coldness and hesitation which you have displayed in the question of the limits and boundaries by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and is a loss of time and that they are still in the hands of the Clovernment which is ruling them, A:c., might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of the sort. As these limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom we should satisfy and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over, but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits and their word is united on this. Therefore they have found it necessary first to discuss this point with the Power in whom they now have their con(idence and trust as a final appeal, viz., the Illustrious British Empire. (Literal translation of the above passage) : ' And therefore they saw the discussion in it iirst the place of their confidence and trust the axis of final appeal now and that is the Illustrious British Kmpire.' Their reason for this union and confidence is mutual interest, the necessity of regulating territorial divisions and the feelings of their inhabitants, so that they may know how to base iheir future and life, so not to meet her (England ?) or any of her Allies in opposition to their resolution which would produce a contrary issue, which God forbid. {Literal translation of above passage as follows) : ' The feelings of its inhabitants to know how to base their future and life for not to meet her or one of its Allies in front of their resolution when the thing comes to a contrary result, which God forbid. ' For the object is, honourable Minister, the truth which is established on a basis which guarantees the essential sources of life in future. Yet within these limits they have not included places inhabited by a foreign race. It is no vain show of words and titles. May God have mercy on the Caliphate and comfort Moslems in it. I am confident that Your Excellency will not doubt that it is not I personally who am demanding of these limits which include only our race, but that they are all proposals of the people who, in short, believe that they are necessary for economic life. Is this not right, Your Excellency the Minister ? In a word. Your High Excellency, we are firm in our sincerity and declaring our preference for loyalty towards you, whether you are satisfied with us, as has been said, or angry. With reference to your remark in your letter above-mentioned that some of our people are still doing their utmost in promoting the interests of Turkey -Your Goodness (lit. ' Perfectness ') would not permit yen to make this an excuse for the tone of coldness and hesitation with regard to our demands, demands which I cannot admit that you. as a man of sound opinion, will deny to be necessary for our existence; nay, they are the essential essence of our life, material and moral. I'p to the present moment, I am myself with all my might carrying out in my country all things in conformity with the Islamic Law, all things whichI tf&gt;n(l to benefit the rest of the kingdom, ami I shall continue to &lt;lo so until it pleases Cod to order otherwise. In order to reassure Your ICxcellency, f can declare that the whole country, together with those who you say are submitting themselves to Turco-German orders, are all waiting the result of those negotiations, which are dependent only on your refusal or acceptanceof the question of the limits and iu your declaration of safeguarding t heir religion first and I lien the rest of rights from any harm or danger. W hatever the illustrious Government of Great Britain finds comformable to its policy in this subject, communicate it to us and specify to us the course we should follow. In all cases it is only God s will which shall be executed and it is God who is the real factor in everything. With regard to our demand for grain for the natives and the monies (surras) known to the Wakfs Ministry and all other articles sent here with pilgrims' caravan, 0 High Excellency, my intention in this matter is to conlirm your proclamations to the whole world, and especially to the Moslem world, that your antagonism is confined only to the party which has usurped the rights of Caliphate in which are included the rights of all Moslems. Moreover, the said grain is from the special Wakfs, and has nothing to do with politics. If you think it should be, let the grain of the two years be transported in a special steamer to Jeddah in an official manner, in the name of all the natives as usual, and the captain of the steamer or the special Mamur detailed as usual every year to hand it over on his arrival at the port will send to the Governor of .leddah asking for the Mamur of the grain at ./ Jeddah or a responsible official to take over the grain and give the necessary ; receipt signed by the said Mamur, that is the Mamur of the grain himself. He should make it a condition that he would (? not) accept any receipt but that signed by this Mamur. Let the captain of the steamer or the Mamur (detailed with the grain) be instructed that if he fmds anything contrary to this arrangement he should warn them that he will return home with the cargo. Thereupon the Mamur and the special committee detailed with him, which is known as the committee of the grain for the natives, will take over the grain in the proper form. Please accept my best regards and salutations, ff von choose to send a reply to this please send it with bearer. 21)th Shawal 13:)3. 'Jth September 11)15. I I.— From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca (with titles). I have received your letter of 19th (? 20th) Shawal with much pleasure and your expressions of friendliness and sincerity have given me the greatest satisfaction. I regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the limits and boundaries with coldness and hesitation ; such was not the case, but it appeared-. t&lt;&gt; me that the moment had not yet arrived when they could be most profitably discussed. &gt; I have realized, however, from your last letter that you regard this ^(|uestion as one of vital and urgent importance. I have, therefore, lost no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your letter and it, is with great pleasure that I communicate to you on their behalf the following statement, which I am confident you will receive with satisfaction. The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, llama, Moms and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. With the above modification, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits and boundaries and, in8 regard to those portions of the territories therein in which (Ireat Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her Ally, \' ranee, I am empowered in the name of the CJovernment of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter :— Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif ol Mecca. Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against all external aggression and will recognize their inviolability. When the situation admits. Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of (government in those various territories. On the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European Advisers and Officials as may be required for the formation of a sound form of administration will be British. With regard to the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra, the Arabs will recognize that the established position and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local populations and to safeguard our mutual economic interests. I am convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible doubt of the sympathy of Great Britain towards the aspirations of her traditional friends the Arabs and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke which for so many years has pressed heavily upon them. 1 have confined myself in this letter to the more vital and important questions, and if there are any other matters dealt with in your letters which 1 have omitted to mention, we may discuss them at some convenient date in the future. It was with very great relief and satisfaction that I heard of the safe arrival of the Holy Carpet and the accompanying offerings which, thanks to the clearness of your directions and the excellence of your arrangements, were landed without trouble or mishap in spite of the dangers and dilficnlties occasioned by the present sad war- May God soon bring a lasting peace and freedom to all peoples. 1 am sending this letter by the hand of your trusted and excellent messenger. Sheikh .Mohammed Ibn Aril' Arayfan, and he will inform you of various matters of interest but of less vital importance, which 1 have not mentioned in this letter. (Here follow the usual compliments.) 24th October 1915. A 12.—Communication from the Grand Sherif of Mecca to the High Commissioner, Cairo. (Literal t ranslation.) In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. To His Excel lency the most exalted and eminent Minister who is endowed with the highest authoritv and soundness of opinion. May God guide him to do His Will. ' 1 received with great pleasure your honoured letter dated loth Zul Hijj (24th October 1915), to which 1 beg to answer as follows (1.) In order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and at the same time to avoid all that may cause Islam troubles and hardships- seeing, moreover, that we have great consideration for the distinguished qualities and dispositions of the Government of Great Britain—we renounce our insistence on the inclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. But the provinces of Aleppo and Beyrout and their sea- I • ©— ^ ^ ,coasts are purely Arab Provinces and there is no difference between a Moslem and a Christian Arab; they are both descendants of one forefather. We Moslems will follow the footsteps of the Commander of the Faithful- ^ hnar ihn Kliattab and other ( aliphs succeeding him, who ordained in the laws of the Moslem faith thai Moslems should treat the Christians as they treat themselves: He, Omar, declared with reference to Christians, 'they will have the same privileges and submit to the same duties as ourselves.' They will thus enjoy their civic rights in as much as it accords with the general interest of the whole nation. I-.j As the i rovinces ol Irak are parts of the pure Arab Kingdom and were in fact the seat of its Governments in the time of Ali Ibn Abu Talib, and in the time ol all Caliphs who succeeded him j and as in them began the civilization ol the Arabs, and as their towns in those provinces were the first towns built m Islam where the Arab power became so great; therefore these provinces are greatly valued by all Arabs far and near, and their traditions cannot be forgotten by them. Consequently, we cannot satisfy the Arab nations or make them submit to give up such a title to nobilitv. Hut in order to render an accord easy, and taking into consideration the assurances mentioned in the filth article of your letter, to keep and guard our mutual interests in that country as they are one and the same, for all these reasons we might agree to leave under the British Administration for a short time those districts now occupied by the British troops, without the rights of either party being prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab nation, which interests are to it economic and vital) and against a suitable sum ])&lt;ii(l as compensation to the Aral) kingdom lor the period of occupation, in order to meet the expenses which every new kingdom is hound to support, at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especially those which are essential. (3.) In your desire to hasten the movement we see not only advantages but grounds of apprehension. The first of these grounds is the fear of the blame of the Moslems of the opposite party (as has already happened in the past) who would declare that we have revolted against Islam and ruined its forces. The second is that standing in the face of Turkey, which is supported by all the forces of Germany, we do not know what Great Britain and her Allies would do if one of the Entente Powers were weakened and obliged to make peace. We fear that the Arab nation will then be left alone in the face of Turkey together with her Allies, but we would not at all mind if we were to face the Turks alone. Therefore it is necessary to take these points into consideration in order to avoid a peace being concluded in which the parties concerned may decide the fate of our people as if we had taken part in the war without making good our claims to official consideration. (4.) The Arab nation has a strong belief that after this war is over, the Turks under German influence will direct their efforts to provoke the Arabs and violate their rights, both material and moral, to wipe out their nobility and honour and reduce them to utter submission as they are determined to ruin them entirely. The reasons for the slowness shown in our action have already been stated. (5.) When the Arabs know that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally who will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace in the face of Turkey and Germany, and that she will support and will elfectivelv defend them, then to enter the war at once will, no doubt, be in conformitv with the general interest of the Arabs. (0.) Our letter dated 29th Shawal loo3 ( ( .)th September 1915) saves us the trouble of repeating our opinions as to Articles 3 and 4 of your honoured last letter regarding administration. Government advisers' and officials, especially as you have declared, 0, Kxalted Minister! that you will not interfere with internal affairs. (7.) The arrival of a clear and definite answer as soon as possible, to the above proposals, is expected. We have done our utmost in making con cessions in order to come to an agreement satisfying both parties. W^know10 that our lot in this war will be either a success which will guaiantee to the Arabs a lifr becoming their past liistory, or destruction in the attempt to attain their objects. Had it not been for the determination which I see in the Arabs for the attainment ol' their objects 1 would have preferred to seclude myself on one of the heights of a mountain ; but they, the Arabs, have insisted that I should guide the movement to this end. • May God keep you safe and victorious, as we devoutly hope and desire. (( nsigned) Dated 27 el Hijj 1333. (5th November 1915.) 13.—From the High Commissioner, Cairo, to the Sherif of Mecca. The Residency, Cairo. After customary greetings and acknowledgment of previous letter. I am gratified to observe that von agree to the exclusion of the vilayets of M ersina and Adana from the boundaries of the Arab territories. I also note with great pleasure and satisfaction your assurances that the Arabs are determined to act i.i coniiormity with the precepts laid down by Omar Ibn Khattab and the early Caliphs, which secure the rights and privileges of all religions alike. lu stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all our treaties with Arab Chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply to all territories included in the Arab Kingdom, as the (tovernment of Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist. With regard to the vilayets of Aleppo and Beyrout, the Government of Great Britain have taken careful note of your observations, but, as the interests of our Ally France are involved, the question will require careful consideration and a further communication on the subject will be addressed to you in due course. The Government of Great Britain, as I have already informed you, are ready to give all guarantees of assistance and support within their power to the Arab Kingdom, but their interests demand, as you yourself have recognized, a friendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Baghdad, and the adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed consideration than the present situation and the urgency of these negotiations permits. We fully appreciate your desire for caution, and we have no wish to urge you to hasty action, which might jeopardise the eventual success of your projects, but in the meantime it is most essential that you should spare no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies. It is on the success of these efforts and on the more active measures which the Arabs may hereafter take in support of our cause, when the time for action comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend. Under these circumstances I am further directed by the Government of Great Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace, in terms of which the freedom of the Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essential condition. As an earnest of our intentions and in order to aid you in your elTors in our joint cause 1 am sending bv vour trustworthv messenger a sum of 20,000/. (Customary ending.) 17th December 1915.

We received from the bearer your two letters dated 9th Safar (17th December 1 ( J15) with great respect and honour, and I have understood their contents, which caused me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction as they removed that which had made me uneasy. Your honour will have realised after the arrival of Mohammed [ FarokiJ Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present, was of no personal inclination or the like, which would have been wholly Tinintelligible, but that everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and that we are but transmitters and executants ol' such decisions and desires in the position they (our people) have pressed upon us. These truths are, in my opinion, very important, and deserve your honour's special attention and consideration. With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication concerning Kl Irak, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, in order to strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and in our words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave the determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice. As regards the Northern Parts and their coasts, we have already stated in our previous letter what were the utmost possible 1 modifications, and all this was only done so to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same feeling and desire which impelled us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France and the agreement made between them during the present wars and calamities; yet we find it our duty that the Eminent Minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for wdiat we now leave to France in Bey rout and its coasts. 1 do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan is of greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of Great Britain, than it is to us ; and will necessarily be so whatever may happen, so that Great Britain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment and advancement which she is endeavouring to establish for them now ; especially as her allies being neighbours to us will be the germ of diiliculties and discussion with which there will be no peace of mind. In addition to which the people of Beyrout will decidedly never accept such isolations and they may oblige us to undertake new measures which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not less than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainty in the reciprocity ot' our interests, which is the only cause that caused us never to care to negotiate with any other Power but you. Consequently, it is impossible to allow any derogation that gives France, or any other Power, a span of land in those regions. 1 declare this and 1 have a strong belief, which the living will inherit from the dead, in the declarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter. Therefore, the honourable and eminent Minister should believe and be sure, together with Great Britain, that we still remain firm to our resolution which Storrs learnt from us two years ago, for which we await the opportunity suitable to our situation, especially in view of that action the time of which has now come near and which destiny drives towards us with great haste and clearness, so that we and those who are of our opinion, may have reasons for such action against any criticisms or responsibilities imposed upon us in future. Your expression 'we do not want to push you to any hasty action which might jeopardise the success of your aim' does not need any more12 explanation except what we may ask for, when necessary, such as arms, ammunition, t^c. I deem this sufficient as I have occupied much of your honour's time. I he^ to offer you my great veneration and respect. I nsigned. Dated 25 Safar, 1334. 1st January IT).—' \'erl)al ' Message. (Written unsigned.) I. It is unworthy of the greatness of (ireat Britain to think that we believe false rumours; we know her justice, &amp;c. &lt;S:c., to her people. '2. You did well in allowing}!.

My dear and beloved Mr. Storrs, My father sends you his best greetings and 1 verily confirm the bonds of my love and old friendship towards you and assure you that I am, indeed, exerting my zeal here as much as possible, as you are doing the same there. (Signed) A. H. l mlated. 17.—Communication from Sir 11. McMahon to the Grand Sherif. The Residency, (After customary greetings.) Cairo. We have received with great pleasure and satisfaction your letter of the 2oth Safar (1st January) at the hands of your trusty messenger, who has also transmitted to us your verbal messages. We fully realize and entirely appreciate the motives which guide you in this important question and we know well that you are acting entirely iu the interests of the Arab peoples and with no thought beyond their welfare. We take note of your remarks concerning the vilayet of Baghdad and will take the question into careful consideration when the enemy has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlements arrives. As regards the Northern parts we note with satisfaction your desire to avoid anything which might possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France. It is, as you know, our fixed determination that nothing shall be permitted to interfere in the slightest degree with our united prosecution of this war to a victorious conclusion. Moreover, when the victory lias been won, the friendship of Great Britain and l-'ranee will become yet more linn and enduring, cemented bv the blood of Englishmen and 113 Freiichmon who have died sid^ by side ligliting for the Cause of Right and Liberty. In this great cause Arabia is now associated and Gud grant that the result of our mutual efforts and co-operation will bind us in a lasting friendship to the mutual welfare and happiness of us all! We are greatly pleased to hear of the action you are taking to win all the Arabs over to our joint cause and to dissuade them from giving any assistance to our enemies, and we leave it to your discretion to seize the most favourable moment for further and more decided measures. You will doubtless inform us by the bearer of this letter of any manner in which we can assist you and your requests will always receive our immediate consideration. ^ on will have heard how El Sayed Ahmed el Sherif el Senussi has been beguiled by evil advice into hostile action, and it will be a great grief to yon to know that lie has been so far forgetful of the interests of the Arabs as to throw in his lot with our enemies. Misfortune has now overtaken him and we trust that this will show him his error and lead him to peace for the sake of his poor misguided followers. W e are sending this letter by the hand of your good messenger, who will also bring to you all our news. With salaams. A. H. M c M ahon. 2o Rabi al Awwal. 18.- Communication from the Grand Sherif of Mecca to the High Commissioner, Cairo. In the name of the Merciful, the Compassionate, to the most noble His Excellency the High Commissioner. May God protect him. After compliments and respects. We received your Excellency's letter dated 25 Rabi al Awwal, and its contents filled us with the utmost pleasure and satisfaction at the attainment of the required understanding and the intimacy desired. 1 ask God to make easy our purposes and prosper our endeavours. Your Excellency will understand the work that is being done, and the reasons for it from the following - Firstly. —A\ e had informed your Excellency that w r e had sent one of our sons to Syria to command the operations deemed necessary there. We have received a detailed report from him stating that the tyrannies of the Government there have not left of the persons upon whom they could depend, whether of the different ranks of soldiers or of others, save only a few, and those of secondary importance; and that he is awaiting the arrival of the forces announced from different places, especially from the people of the country and the surrounding Arab regions as Aleppo and the south of Mosul, whose total number is calculated at not less than 100,000 by their estimate; and he intends, if the majority of the forces mentioned are Arab, to begin the movement by them : and, if otherwise, that is, of the Turks or others, he will observe their advance to the canal, and when they begin to fight, his movements upon them will be different to what they expect. Secondly —\\ e purposed sending our eldest son to Medina with sufficient forces to strengthen his brother (who is) in Syria, and with every possibility ol occupying the railway line, or carrying out such operations as circum stances may admit. This is the beginning of the principal movement, and we are satisfied in its beginning with what we had levied as guards to keep the interior of the country quiet; they are of the people of llijaz only, for many reasons, which it would take too long to set forth, chiefly the difficulties in the way of providing their necessities with secrecy and speed (although this precaution was not necessary) and to make it easy to bring reinforcements when needed ; this is the summary of what you wished to understand, in my opinion it is sufficient, and it is to be taken as a foundation and a standard as to our actions in the face of all changes and untoreseen events which the sequence of events may show. It remains for us to state what we need at present. s. aou. j)u Firsth/. —I'ho amount of 50,000 pounds in gold for the monthly pay of the troops levied, and other things the necessity o{ : which needs no explanation. We beg you to send it with all possible haste. Secondly. —20,000 sacks of rice, 15,000 sacks of flour, 3,000 sacks of barley, 150 sacks of coffee, 150 sacks of sugar, 5,000 rifles of the modern pattern and the necessary ammunition, and 100 boxes of the two sample cartridges (enclosed) and of Martini Henry cartridges and ' Aza,' that is of those of the rifles of the factory of St. Etienne in France for the use of those two kinds of rifles of our tribes, it would not be amiss to send 500 boxes of both kinds. Thirdly. -We think it better that the place of deposit of all these things should be Port Sudan. Pourthly.—~As the above provisions and munitions are not needed until the beginning of the movement (of which we will inform you oflicially), they should remain at the above place, and when we need them we will inform the Governor there of the places to which they may be conveyed and of the in termediaries who will carry orders for receiving them. h'if tidy. —The money required should be sent at once to the Governor of Port Sudan, and a confidential agent will be sent by us to receive it either all at once or in two instalments, according as he is able, and this t ) is the (secret) sign to be recognised for accepting the man. Sixthly. —Our envoy who will receive the money shall be sent to Port Sudan in three weeks time, that is to say, he will be there on the Fifth of 1 9th March. Jamad Awal 1 , with a letter from us addressed to A1 Khawaga Klias Effendi saying that he (Elias) will pay him, in accordance with the letter, the rent of our properties, and the signature will be clear in our name, but we will instruct him to ask for the Governor of the place, whom you will apprise of this persons arrival. After perusal of letter, the money should be given to him on condition that no discussion whatever is to be made with him of any question concerning us. We beg you most emphatically iiOt to tell him anything, keeping this affair secret, and he should be treated apparently as if he were nothing out of the way. Let it not be thought that our appointment of another man results from lack of confidence in bearer; it is only to avoid waste of time, for we are appointing him to a task elsewhere. At the same time we beg yon not embark or send him in a steamer, or ollicially, the means already arranged being sufficient. Seventhly. —Our representative, bearer of the present letter, has been definitely instructed to ensure the arrival of this, and 1 think that his mission this time is finished since 1 the condition of things is known both in general and in detail, and there is no need for sending anyone else. In case 4 of need for sending information, it will come from us ; yet, as our next representative will reach you after three weeks, you may prepare instruc tions for him to take back. ^ et let him be treated simply in appearance. hJighthly. —Let the British Government consider this military expen diture in accordance with the books which will be furnished it, explaining how the money has been spent. To conclude, my best and numberless salutations beyond all increase. (I nsigned.) 14 Rabi al A kliar. (18th February lOlb.) 19. On separate sheet. 1. They (the Turks) order us to expedite tlu journey of a group of Germans to the coasts of Africa (I think the shores of the Ped Sea) and we replied consenting with all readiness. .We await their letter. Upon their arrival here we will inform you by some secret means, explaining what is necessary about their journey and its destination.2. lu Egypt, maybe in Sharcjia, is a place known as Isna al Jabal. Keep it under observation in some inconspicnous manner, because it will be a place from which will be mnde comniiinications with the exterior. 3. They asked us to send as quickly as possible 10,0()0 camels for transport to arrive within 45 days, and we excused ourselves. 4. It is desirable, even necessary, to exercise close vigilance upon the coasts of Yemen, beginning at Leith, because of the money sent to them through our country by Haia (for they are in great need) in order that they may be reduced without trouble (actual fighting). j. The matter uf our personal property 1 is not of great importance to us, because, as they say, there is fallen into the trap something bigger than the bird (i.e., greater things are at stake). G. It is imperative to keep the grain, with the remainder of the provisions and munitions. 20.—Sherif Abdall i to Mr. Storrs. 'To my good and dear friend, With the fingers of joy and exultation 1 received your noble letter dated 1 llabi al Akhar (4th February) and 1 cannot describe my joy thereat, as it set forth true friendship and sure affection. Verily 1 am, praise lie to God, in good health and spirits, and as you well know of a sincere intention and transparent honesty; and my hope, God willing, is the accomplishment of meeting and converse in the very near future, and have instructed the bearer to inform you of what is necessary. (iod protect you. Kxpress our best greeting to the noble Commissioner. 14 Rabi al Akhar 1334. A bdall a iny H osayn. (18th February.) 21.—Verbal message from the Sherif Abdalla to Mr. Storrs. Thanks and messages. My father is following up a policy which requires time, while 1 work out the practical details by means of a secret council of Arab notables and Islamic dignitaries, the result of which he will soon perceive. We have written certain requests, which we hope will be granted without delay or loss of time. 1 request 3,000Z. for myself. Be assured that • very thing is going forward excellently, and success is certain. 1 wish to make the Bedawin work properly and this requires money. 1 desire speedy despatch of letter to Tdrisi, the matter being important. 22. —Communication from Sir A. H. McMahon to the Grand Sherif. (After customary greetings.) We have received your letter of the 14th Uabi al Akhar (18th February), duly delivered by your trusted messenger. We are grateful to note the active measures which you propose to take. We consider them the most suitable in the existing circumstances, and they have the approval of His Majesty's Government. I am pleased to be able to inform you that His Majesty's Government have approved of meeting your requests, and that which you asked to be sent with all haste is being despatched with your messenger, who is also the bearer of this letter. 1 Tins alludes to a verbal message sent to him on the occasion of the last visit of his messenger, informing him that his personal property in Egypt was being well looked after.16 vA The remainder will be collected as quickly as possible, and will be deposited at Port Sudan, where it will remain until we hear from you othcially of the beginning of the movement and of the places to which they may be conveyed, and the intermediaries who will carry out the orders for receiving them. The necessary instructions, as set forth in your letter, have been issued to the Governor at Port Sudan, and he will arrange everything in accordance with your wishes. Your representative who brought your last letter has been duly facilitated in his journey to Jeizan, and every assistance has been given him in his mission, which we trust will be crowned with good results. We have arranged that, on completion, he will be brought to Port Sudan, whence he will proceed by safest means to join you, and report the results of his work. We take the opportunity, in sending this letter, to explain to you a matter which otherwise might not have been clear to you, and which might have given rise to misunderstanding. There arc various Turkish posts and small garrisons along the coasts of Arabia who are hostile to us, and who are said to be planning injury to cur naval interests in the Red Sea. We may, therefore, iind it necessary to take hostile measures against these posts and garrisons, but we have issued strict instructions that every care must be taken by our ships to differentiate between the hostile Turkish garrisons and the innocent Arab inhabitants, towards whom we entertain such friendly feelings. We give you notice of this matter in case distorted and false reports may 11^5 reach you of the reasons for any action which we may be obliged to take. We have heard rumours that our mutual enemies are endeavouring to / construct boats for the purpose of laying mines in the Red Sea, and of other- 7 wise injuring our interests there, and we beg of you that you will give us early information should you receive any confirmation of such reports. We have heard that Ibn Rashid lias been selling large quantities of camels to the Turks, which are being sent up to Damascus. We hope that you will be able to use your influence with him in order that he may cease this practice, and, if he still persists, that you will be able to arrange for the Arabs who lie between him and Syria to seize the camels as they pass—a procedure which will be to our mutual advantage. I am glad to be able to inform you that those misguided Arabs under Sayed Ahmed el Senussi, who have fallen victims to the wiles of Turkish and German intriguers, are now beginning to stetlie error of their ways and are coming in to us in large numbers, asking for forgiveness and friendship. We have severely defeated the forces which these intriguers had collected against us, and the eyes of the Arabs are now becoming open to the deceit which has been practised upon them. The capture of Erzerum and the defeats sustained by the Turks in the Caucasus are having a great effect in our favour, and are greatly helping the cause for which we are both working. We ask God to prosper your endeavours and to further the work which you have taken in hand. In conclusion, we beg you to accept our warmest salutations and expressions of friendship. (Signed) A. II.
