Each of the cases has a page(s) of office notes at the end of their correspondence. In later (1942) cases, office notes are situated before the case correspondence. There is no index to the cases at the front of the file. Each case has a cover sheet with the case number and name of the slave or applicant involved.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 340; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence between ff 303-348, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence relating to forty-one manumission cases, heard at the Muscat Political Agency. All of the cases included in the file are straightforward in nature. Most of the cases include manumission statements taken down from the slave at the Muscat Agency, which were sent to the Political Agent in Bahrain for a decision. In those cases where the slave resided or was owned by a master based on the Trucial Coast, correspondence between Agency staff and the Residency Agent at Sharjah is included, which attempt to verify the slave's story. Correspondence from the Sharjah Agent was returned in Arabic with English translations. In most cases, the manumission statements were given by enslaved individuals seeking their own manumission. In eight of the cases in the file, manumission statements were given by persons seeking the restoration of family members.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00023a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00023a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
