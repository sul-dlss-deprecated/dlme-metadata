He goes on to write that His Royal Highness [Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mīrzā] has asked for two ships for the conveyance of troops to Bahrain, but his proposed mode of payment is such that Bruce has responded by stating that ships are not procured on such terms. Bruce asks for Keir's guidance on this subject and encloses a copy and translation of the eleventh article of the treaty with Persia (not included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x00001d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
