Dwarfism-a genetic condition characterized by unusually short stature and shortened limbs-is frequently represented in Egyptian tomb reliefs and statues, and the remains of dwarfs have been found in tombs associated with the royal cemeteries. Dwarfs held important positions in the administration of the ancient Egyptian government, and they also worked as jewelers, performed in special rituals (in which they were called \"god's dancers\"), or served as midwives. Some were believed, because of their unusual appearance, to have supernatural powers and a special relation to the gods. \r\n\r\nThe dancing posture and the oversized phallus of this dwarf-figure should secure virility and male potency for the owner in this life as well as the afterlife.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1930", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/9556", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Abemayor, Cairo [date and mode of acquistion unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1930, by purchase;  Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-17T15:10:01.847", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1651_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1651_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1651_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1651_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1651_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2172", "Images": "CUR_48.1651_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1651_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1651_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1651_Lft_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1651_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1651_Top_DD_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
