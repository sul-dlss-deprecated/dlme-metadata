In this case I am not sure that the matter is got right in these drafts. The first thing to he clear about is the order in which each of these various instruments we have before us is to be signed and I imagine that the first document to be signed is the agreement between the company and His Majesty*s Government ( vide the terms of the second recital)• It is part of the arrangement that the Sheikh shall have the right to terminate the concession, not only in the cases where the company breaks the terms of the concession itself, but also if the company breaks the provisions of its agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and that in case of dispute on the question of breach of the agreement the arbitration provisions of the concession shall apply. It is necessary to get the company’s agreement to this addition to the terms of the concession. There are two ways of doing this. (1) getting the company’s acceptance of this in the agreement between them and His Majesty’s Government. If this course is followed you would put into the agreement with the company the substance of the v/hole of paragraph 3 of the first letter to the Sheikh, pages 10 to 12, and not merely sub-paragraph (b) as in article 11 of the draft agreement at the moment. In this case the last sentence of page 12 and the letter on page 15 are unnecessary. (2) The alternative course is to say nothing about this in the agreement in the/the first place, hut to set out the whole arrangement as in the draft letter to the Sheikh. Then when the Sheikh has accepted the draft letter, write to the company and obtain their formal agreement to everything that is in the draft letter. 3 The second alternative seems to he in essence that which was intended to he adopted, see paragraph 4 of the letter to the Sheikh on page 12 and the letter on page 15; hut if this is so I do not see how article 11 of the agreement is required. U The next document to he signed, as I understand it, is the concession itself. I have only got before me an old draft of the concession and I am not attempting to consider its terms which are, I imagine in any case subject to negotiations with the Sheikh. But I understand that in signing the concession agreement the Sheikh states that he signs it subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. If this is so then something to this effect should either he in the concession itself or in a document signed at the same time as the concession. The next document which has to he signed is the draft letter to the Sheikh as to which I have no comments except that I should have thought we should want to say in that letter not merely that the company agreed that the Sheikh should have power to determine the concession if the company broke their agreement with His Majesty’s Government (the company’s acceptance of this will of course appear in the agreement itself if article 11 is amended as I have suggested above) hut also that the Sheikh will, if His Ma j esty * s/I Majesty’s Government say that the agreement has been 'broken by the company, exercise his right of termination. Then as I understand it the Sheikh replies to this letter and then His Majesty’s Government say they approve the agreement subject to a further condition. This is page 14. Then the Sheikh has to accept this further letter and then finally the letter on page 13 is sent saying that His Majesty’s Government approve agreement. 7 There are a few other points of wording and detail. Draft Political agreement, page 3, article 1 - In view of the definition in the Preamble it will appear that the words should be ’'the company'' simply. Article 2 would read better if drafted as follows: 'The concession 'between the company and the Sheikh shall not be 'transferred by the company to any other person or 'corporate body without the prior consent in writing of 'His Majesty’s Government. It is understood that His 'Majesty’s Government will not in any case give their 'consent to the transfer of the concession to any person 'except on the condition that the transferee is a British 'company registered in Great Britain and having etc.” ^ Article 3 seems to me to require redrafting. It would appear that the first paragraph really deals with employees other than manual labourers and the second \ paragraph with manual labourers, otherwise I do not understand the working of the two provisions side by side. It would appear that this ought to be amended. Article 6, line 4-1 think we should say 'and approved by the 'Political Resident'. As I understand the position we shall/shall have to obtain jurisdiction from the Sheikh over foreigners in Debai and we shall exercise that jurisdiction by Order in Council and King’s Regulations made under the Order in Council as in $atar and therefore the Sheikh’s regulations about aircraft would be made applicable to British subjects, etc. by King’s Regulation made by the Political Resident. Under the King’s Regulation procedure it is possible to say that the Political Resident approves the Sheikh’s regulations. In any case, strictly speaking, article 6 is hardly necessary at all, because if the position is as stated above we should make the King’s Regulation and it would become automatically binding on the company. I doubt if article 10 is properly drafted. Its proper terms, however, really depend, in the first place, on the terms of the concession. I imagine, however, the concession gives the company right to v/ork in any area provided the land is either State land or unoccupied and in other places provided arrangements are made with the private owners. If this is so the company does not have to obtain the permission of the Sheikh. They have already the right to go there. It would be surely better to say here''without giving notice if to the Sheikh that they are going there and then to say that if the Sheikh unreasonably, in the comuany’s oninion, says he cannot offer them full protection, the matter is to be referred to the Political Resident. As regards the Refinery Agreement it would surely be wise to add at the end arbitration/arbitration provisions similar to those contained in the pre-emption clause. (Sgd.) W.E.

The concessionaire company is an emanation of the Iraq Petroleum Coy., which represents in equal proportions the Anglo-Iranian Coy., the Royal Dutch Shell Coy. and French and American groups; British interests, though less than 50% of the whole, are thus larger than those of any single foreign nationality; it was impracticable to secure a wholly British concessionaire because of a longstanding agreement between the constituent groups of the I.P.C. not to compete against each other in the area in question. The documents which are now almost ready for completion consist of:- (1) The concession itself. Our main concern with this was to see, with the assistance of the Petroleum Dept., that the Sheikh gets a square deal. This has been done. I* u (2) A (political ) agreement between the Coy. and H.M.G. to secure British interests in such matters, for example, as the nationality of employees; the reservation of sites and facilities which mi^t te required/i reqaired for defence purposes or other British interests; pre-emption of oil in time of emergency; and measures to facilitate the carrying out of our responsibilities for protection of the concessionaire. (3) A separate agreement between the Coy. and H.L.Cr. in regard to the possible establishment of a refinery (by which the Admiralty set great store). (4) An exchange of letters between the Political Resident and the bneikh ito be followed by an exchange of letters between this Office and the Coy.) linking (1) and (2) and providing a sanction for the obligations under (2). The procedure follows. gutatig mutandija . that adopted in the grants of concessions by the Sheikh of Koweit to an Anglo-American company in 1934 and by the Sheikh of Qatar to the A.I.O.C. in 1935. In the present c ^^®^J 10wever » have succeeded in obtaining iNttb terms from the Coy. in regard to the question of a refinery; and this is placed in a separate agreement, as it will cover any other concessions which the Coy. may obtain. The main purpose of the draft letter to the other/iy.r/. 'll other Depts. is to obtain their formal concurrence in the signature of the political agreement by the 1.0. on behalf of H.M.G.Minute Paper political Department Please see P.Z .12 on which it was approved that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. (which is the Iraq Petroleum Company without the Iraqi Chairman) should he allowed to negotiate for oil concessions on the Trucial Coast,in the Koweit Neutral Zone and in Muscat, on the basis of the draft concessions on which the Company prepoopcl to base their negotiatiemis which were forwarded with Mr. Skliros ’ s letter of the 10th Pcoombcr 1035, No.P.Z. jS'y /?•(&gt; . 2. The first Sheikh with whom the Company have negotiated for an oil concession is the Sheikh of Lebai. . (ijkik 4a,/UmmI a (hfaiXtu*! ra/ti) Major Holmes, who is acting for P.C.L./, spent some time 'vi/uAV'-Wv^ —• in negotiation with the Sheikh, at the beginning of September. He managed to reach a satisfactory conclusion and the draft concession was initialled with K only a few alterations from the original draft. The only two changes of real importance were in the royalty clause (which of course was a series of blanks in the original draft concession) and in clause 10, in which the Sheikh added a provision about the treatment of the Company 1 s employees w r ho might get into trouble in the State. The draft concession in its final form is in the envelope flagged A. All the alterations from the original draft are side-lined in red pencil. 3. The changes were gone through with Colonel Fowle, the Political Resident, when he was in the office on deputation in September, and were discussed with the r\ Company. On Colonel Fowle’s advice certain further alterations were made in Articles 9 and 10, to safeguard the rights of H.M.G. , and alterations were also made in the royalty Article 5 on the advice of the Petroleum Department, who pointed out that in its form as amendedby Major Holmes and the Sheikh, it did not give the Sheikh a square deal (the details of the Petroleum Department's point.which really does not concern H.M.G.'s interests, are explained in Mr.Gunn's letter of tfc ^ at P.Z. tlfll/ii). &amp; ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ are e 4. In addition to these changes a new draft clause has been added, No. ^ in red inkJ designed t meet the contingency of a difference of opinion between the Sheikh and his neighbours about their boundaries. The Company suggested the addition of this clause (which makes the Politica it is hoped that the Sheikh may accept it. Even if he does not it will certainly be necessary in practice for the Political Resident to resolve any such disputes that may arise. 5. As will be seen from the above remarks and from the final text in the envelope flagged A, the draft ial concession does not differ very substantially commerc frcm the original draft, and the alterations have been carefully scrutinised by the Departments concerned. It is submitted that the concession may be approved in its final form. 6 . To go with the commercial concession there is a draft political agreem ent flagged B ^ WOl* oetween H.M.G. and the Company, which safeguards H.M .G.’s interest This draft political agreement is based on the politi agreement attached to the Qatar concession, which was worked out with great care last year. The alterations are not of any substance (they are mnrk-ed in red ink) except in respect of the refinery clause (which was Article 9 of the Qatar Agreement), and the addition of a new Article (No.lC). It has been agreed with the Company that the refinery clause should be separate frcm the political agreement and it is dealt with below. As regards the new Article t this is rendered desirable by the/Minute Paper.

The Political Resident will be the umpire if the Company considers that the Sheikh is unnecessarily restricting the movement of the Company. •fCJ 7. Apart from these two points *it will be seen that the draft political agreement follows the Q,atar Political Agreement closely, and it is submitted that it may be approved in this form. 8 . The refinery clause in the Qatar political agreement gave a good deal of trouble at the time, and an unsatisfactory canpromise was reached with the A.P.O.C. under which the Company said that it was their intention to erect a refinery if they considered that commercial considerations justify it. The Admiralty are very keen to see as many refineries as possible in territory controlled by H.M.G., and they therefore pressed very strongly that we should take the present opportunity of getting a much stiffer refinery undertaking from P.C.L. It is suggested that the undertaking to be given should cover all the areas on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf in which P.C.L. may now or hereafter obtain concessions, and that the products of all these areas should be lumped together with a view to considering when the time comes whether there is sufficient crude oil to justify the erection of a refinery. The draft undertaking originally proposed by the Admiralty in consultation with the Petroleum Department is at P.Z. 3 3 fi £ f flagged C. The gist of it was that if the total production of theCompany got to 500,000 tons per annum of crude oil they would automatically have to set up a refinery with a capacity of 250,000 tons, and increase the capacity of the refinery pari passu with the increase in the production of crude oil so that it should always be half the crude oil production. The Company said that an undertaking of this kind was totally impossible and that it might involve them in pouring several hundred thousand pounds down the drain, since there might, when it came to the point, be no market for their refined products. They argued that it was essential that commercial considerations should be taken into account in arriving at a decision in regard to the erection of a refinery. This view seemed to this Department entirely reasonable and was accepted by the Admiralty and the Petroleum Department. As a result a compromise has been suggested to the Company and it is understood that they are likely to accept it, or at any rate something not very substantially different from it. The compromise is at P.Z. , flag ged _D , and there are certain passages in it underlined in red which may not be acceptable to the Company. The Admiralty, who are the Department really concerned, do not press for these words if they are not acceptable to the Company. 9. In the circumstances sanction is requested for the conclusion of the refinery agreement with the Company either w r ith or without the underlined words as circumstances may dictate. 10. Finally it is proposed at the time of the signature of the concession and the political agreement (the refinery agreement is to be secret between H.M.G. and the Company and will not be divulged to the Sheikhs concerned) to exchange notes with the Sheikh of Debai similar to those exchanged with the Sheikh of Qatar at the time of the signature of the Qatar concession and agreement. + The draft notes are at Flag E.

As will be seen, the notes are practically identical except that in the present instance it is proposed to add a provision that if the Sheikh is considering admitting a branch of a bank into his Sheikhdom (a reference to this possibility was, as will have been seen, one of the additions made to the commercial concession) he will consult with H.M.G. as well as with the Company as to which bank it should be. The object of the exchange of notes is briefly to secure an undertaking from the Sheikh that he will observe the terms of the political agreement in so far as they concern him, and will regard them as overriding the terms of the commercial concession if there is any conflict between them. They also provide for the application to the political agreement of the \ arbitration machinery in the commercial agreement. Complementary to the exchange of notes with the Sheikh there has, of course, to be a corresponding exchange of notes with the Company, as will be seen from the Q,atar print at Flag F. 11. In view of the fact that the proposed exchange of notes with the Sheikh and the complementary exchange with the Company follow, mutatis mutandis , the lines of Qatar exchanges, it is submitted that they may be approved. 12. It should perhaps be mentioned that in connection with the exchange of notes it had been proposed by the Government of India (P.Z. Z ) in consultation with the Political Resident that the Sheikh should be asked to undertake that in the event of his failing adequately to protect the Company’s employees he should pay such compensation as H.M.G. should think reasonable. This proviso in regard to compensation has been applied to the options which the Company have obtained from the Trucial Sheikhs/Sheikhs. The intention was to bring home to the Sheikhs the importance of implementing their obligations for protection about which they might otherwise not worry unduly. The proviso was of course desirable in respect of the option period when small bodies of geologists and explorers would be wandering about in the interior of the Trucial Sheikhdoms where conditions are by no means safe, but after consultation with Colonel Fowle last month the department came to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to make the proviso in respect of the concessions, since when the Company is working a full blown concession conditions a will be quite different and protection will be^/far more easy and stabilised affair. There will be large bodies of employees, rigs, buildings, etc., and regular guards housed in special buildings. Moreover, the Sheikh will clearly see that his prospect of royalties from oil production depends on the workings of the Company being adequately protected, and he is not likely.to overlook his responsibilities as he might in the case of small bodies of geologists, etc. wandering about the country. Another argument in favour of dropping the compensation proviso was that it has led to a lot of trouble with the Sheikhs in respect of the options since most of the Sheikhs have been very reluctant to enter into what seems to them unlimited liabilities for compensation. 13.

I accept the decision that the Pre-emption Clause should stand part of the Political Agreement. The only comment I have to make on the Draft Political Agreement relates to Article 4. In your letter P.Z.7105/36, dated the 31st October, you agreed that the words 'in all except unimportant or routine matters' should be inserted between the words 'The Company' and the words'shall deal', in the first line of the Article. These words are, however, not to be found in your Draft. This is no doubt, an oversight which you will put right. I have no objection to raise to the verbal alterations which you have made in the Draft Refinery Agreement. I now wait to hear from you that the Shaikh has accepted the principles involved in the Political Agreement and Draft Exchange of Notes. Holmes leaves here for the Persian Gulf on the 4th December.

These comments are being brought to the notice of the interested departments of His Majesty’s Government. As regards the Preemption Clause, it is the case that I told Longrigg we were considering favourably the suggestion for taking this out of the individual Political Agreements and adding it to the Refinery Agreement, and that I anticipated this would be agreed to. Since then, however, we have been going into the matter further and it seems to us inevitable that the individual Sheikhs should assent to the Preemption Clause (which among other things provides for H.M.G. taking over the entire working of the concession in certain circumstances). This being so, the point of removing the Clause from the Political Agreements loses its force (the idea of course is that the Refinery Agreement should not have to be ' submitted to the individual Sheikhs), and we propose to leave it in. No question principle is I think involved! 50 1(5 5000 7 36 Longrigg’s/* 2. Draft Longrigg’s point was merely that the Q complicated Schedule might confuse the w Sheikhs’ minds* But we shall have to leave it to our local people to explain the matter to them in simple language. As regards the last paragraph of your letter, the various drafts are at present under submission for the final formal sanction of H.M.G. Directly this is obtained, we propose to telegraph to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf authorising him to show to the Sheikh of Debai the Draft Political Agreement and the draft exchange of notes, explain them to him and secure his acceptance of the principles involved. The Sheikh will then be -in-a position tu—oonelude—Irfre Commerni a 1-noncess4nn wi.th^-Ma-^or-Ifolines and jjhen we hear by telegraph that this h^s been done we can immediately complete the kiM signature of the Political Agreement^ and authorise the Resident by telegraph to effect the exchange . / of notes with the Sheikh* 3 K The Refinery Agreement we can of course complete at our leisure and independently of the above procedure, since it is a bilateral agreement only and the Sheikh is not concerned. Yours sincerely , P.S. I enclose a copy of the Draft Political A Agreement in its final lb rm.

Skliros CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON • E.C.2 18th November, 1936. Dear Mr. Glauson, I refer to your letter P,Z*7702/36, dated the 28th October to Longrigg (who left last week on a short visit to the Near East), on the subject of the proposed Refinery Clause in the Political Agreements between P-C.L* and His Majesty^ Government in respect of concessions which may be obtained on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. Your revised draft marked 'B” has been duly considered by the Board, and is accepted - not without some qualms. The Board rely on the fact that they can look to K*M.G. for a reasonable interpretation of the phrase u commercial considerations” and that E.lvAG. appreciate in particular that a small production in a number of separate concession areas, even though the total might reach 500,000, might not necessarily justify the erection of a refinery in any one of those areas, if the cost of collecting small parcels of crude oil and transporting them to a central refinery site were a serious item of expenditure. They also think it right that I should draw the attention of H.M*G. to the fact that, even if oil is found in the Trucial Coast, it does not necessarily follow that it will be of such quality as to make it a commercial proposition to obtain from it the particular products in which H.T.G* may then happen to be interested, or to process it in the manner and to the extent necessary to make it comply with the particular specifi cations which may be laid down by the Admiralty or the Royal Air Force, and still rind a market for it at competitive prices. Longrigg has given me to understand that it has been agreed with you that the Pre-emption Clause, which in the -^atar case is a schedule to the Political Agreement, will, in this case, be a schedule to the Refinery Agreement.&lt;g&gt; May I take it that we shall shortly be receiving this Refinery Agreement and Political Agreement for signature, since I gather that all outstanding points have been settled in the correspondence ending with your letter ho*P*Z*7105/36, dated the 31st October; and that the Dubai Draft Notes received with your letter P*2,* 7265/36, dated the 23rd October, have been duly approved by all the interested Departments of H.M.Cr. and are ready to go off to the Political Resident the moment the Political and the Refinery Agreements are signed* Yours sincerely.

And neither does the Shaikh guarantee to the Company what may be caused by unforeseen circumstances, nor will he be responsible therefor. For instance, should, God forbid, an attack be made by an enemy or any accident occurs in spite of him, through any aggressor, the Shaikh shall, in case of such aggression, use his endeavour to ward off an aggression of this nature; but he shall not be responsible for any loss or damage thereby caused. Article Twelfth. —The Company has the right to transfer this Agreement to any other commercial Company; but it shall have not right to transfer it to any Government whatsoever on the conditions that the said Company shall be able to fulfil the obligations of this Agreement and its engagements entirely. The Company shall inform the Shaikh if it transferred this Agreement in the manner aforesaid and obtain his assent and acquiescence. And the Company shall have the liberty to form a single Company, if it finds it necessary, to carry out this Agreement, and that Company so formed shall be identical with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, and the aforesaid Company shall enjoy all the rights and privileges grantedto the Company in virtue of this Agreement, and it must bear all the engagements and responsibilities set forth therein. Article Thirteenth—The Company may terminate this Agreement if it finds it disagreeable for it to act upon the same ; but it shall have no right to cancel it or to abandon it and to discontinue operating it except after three years with effect froi^% the beginning of operation, by giving six months’ previous notice, in writing, to the Shaikh of its intention to do so. And if the said cancellation should take place within thirty-five years from the date of signature of this Agreement, all the lands granted by the Shaikh and any lands or buildings purchased by the Company and any houses or buildings constructed by, and any immoveable properties belonging to, the Company within the State of Qatr shall be surrendered to the Shaikh free of charge. And the wells actually producing at the time of the said cancellation shall be surrendered in a condition considered to be good and satisfactory, as they were at that time. And if the said cancellation should take place after thirty-five years from the date ol signature of this Agreement, all the Company’s properties within the State of Qatr shall be surrendered, in that case, to the Shaikh, free of charge ; and the wells actually producing at the time of the said cancellation shall be surrendered in a condition which is reasonably considered good and satisfactory, as thev were at that time. On the termination of this Agreement at the conclusion of the seventy-five years, stipulated for in the Second Article, or the conclusion of any extension or renewal of its period all the Company’s properties existing in the State of Qatr shall be surrendered to the Shaikh free of charge ; and the wells actually producing at that time shall be surrendered in a condition which is reasonably considered good and satisfactory, as they used to be at that time. Article Fourteenth .—The Shaikh has the right to cancel this Agreement in the two cases mentioned below : — (A) If the Company fails to pay the sums mentioned in the Fourth Article within six months from the date they fall due. Provided that if any dispute should be made by the Company in regard to any payment thereof, the Shaikh shall not cancel the Agreement until arbitration takes place thereon in accordance with Article Sixteenth and unless the Company fails to comply with the award of the arbitrators within three months from the date of the said award. (B) If the Company is in default according to the provisions for arbitration set forth in the Sixteenth Article. Article fifteenth. Ihe Shaikh shall not hold the Company liable if default should occui on the pait of the Company in carrying out or fulfilling the provisions of the Agreement b\ the mere occurrence of force rnajeure delaying operation ; but should anj difference occui between His kxcellency the Shaikh and the Company as to the existence or non-existence of such force viajeurc, the same shall be referred to arbitration, as provided for in the Sixteenth Article. And the shaikh stipulates that the face majeure delaying operation means that which occurs in connection m ith the Company s operations in Qatr and that nothing else must be taken into consideiaticn and must not be used by the Company as an argument in this respect. And the C ompany shall proceed to effect repairs at the time when any damage, ol an} nature, takes place, and the period of the said delay, together with any period reasonably necessary for repairing the damage will be added to the period fixed m accordance with this Agreement. Article Sixteenth. Should any dispute occur between the Shaikh and the Company in regard to the interpretation of this Agreement or of any matter arising therefrom or m regard to the engagements obligator on either of the parties in accordance therewith, such dispute shall be referred to two arbitrators if no agreement can be arrived at for settling it by any other method, and the Shaikh will appoint one of them and the other will be appointed by the Company. Each of the two parties shall appoint his arbitrator within thirty days after receiving the demand therefor iron, the other party. The two arbitrators shall thereupon appoint a thud aibitrator but il the two arbitrators or any two arbitrators appointed instead of them are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within sixty days from the demand loi aibitration, the two parties agree that, in that case, the' third arbitrator shou d be appointed by the Politica Resident; and the Shaikh makes it a condition that he should agree to the third arbitrator.The award of arbitration shall be consistent with the legal principles familiar to civilised nations. The decision of the majority of arbitrators shall be final, and the place of arbitration shall be Qatr. On giving any award, the arbitrators shall fix a sufficient time within which the party against whom the award is given, should carry out the said award. And that party shall be considered at fault only when he fails to comply with the award before the expiry of the aforesaid period and not otherwise. Article Seventeenth. —The labourers employed by the Company must be from amongst the Shaikh’s own subjects or from amongst those approved by the Shaikh, excepting technical employees and the managers and clerks whom the Company may require and whom it cannot find in the country. As the Shaikh prescribes as a condition the dismissal of any employee whose retention is disapproved by the Shaikh, if the Shaikh has observed any irregular conduct on his part. And it naturally follows that the wages which the Company pays to the employees from amongst Qatr people shall be reasonable. Article Eighteenth. —The Shaikh and the Company declare that they base action upon this Agreement on the basis of good faith and pure belief and upon the interpretation of this Agreement in a manner consistent with reason. And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh’s authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the State of Qatr principality and to respect them in every manner. Article Nineteenth. —Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Shaikh in any manner whatever from granting concessions to other parties for anything excepting the Substances mentioned in the First Article provided that the said concessions do not interfere with the rights of the Company or its operations in accordance with this Agreement. Article Twentieth. —The Company will pay all the sums due to the Shaikh, in accordance with this Agreement, into the Shaikh’s account in the Eastern Bank Limited in Bahrein and the receipt taken from that Bank shall be a full acquittance of the Company’s liability for the sum mentioned in the Bank’s receipt. The Shaikh may, from time to time appoint another Bank or other Banks for the purposes of this Article, and this shall be done in writing. Article Twenty-First —This Agreement shall be binding upon both parties and their successors and assigns ; and it has been written in Arabic and English and all due care has been taken to make the two texts identical in meaning. And if any difference should arise as to the meaning or the interpretation of any article, at any time, the Arabic version is to be relied upon. Article Twenty-Second. —The expression year, month and day used in this Agreement shall mean what is consistent with the English Solar Calendar and not any other.

Yy dear Longrigg, V/ould you kindly refer to your letter of the 31st August, No.P.C.28/78, and connected correspondence about the proposed Refinery Clause in the Political Agreements between the Company and His Majesty's Government in respect of the Concessions which they may obtain on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. I enclose a copy of a revised draft Clause which we subsequently drew up in the hope that it might represent a compromise whicla the Company would feel able to accept. As you will see, it is less rigid than the original draft Clause. I showed this revised draft to you a little time ago but gathered from you that you thought it would be quite impossible for the Company to accept it as it stood and that no draft could be acceptable to the Company unless it took commercial considerations into account. We have since considered the matter once more and Longrig; b.ii. iiongrigg, Msq. , Petroleum Concessions Limited, City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C. Gfdfcrr COPY SENT BY AIR OCT 1936 —.

INDIA OFFftE |2. we are now inclined to a^ree that it is desirable to introduce a reference to coniLiercial considerations, which in any case His Majesty’s Government would have in fairness to the Company to take into account when the time came, and that it is unnecessary to make the Agreement too rigid in regal'd to the size of the Refinery -which would he set up, a matter which would necessarily he affected hy circumstances of the time. With these considerations in mind we have prepared a further revised draft which I also enclose (marked ’S’). As you will see, it constitutes a very considerable advance to meet the Company’s point of view, and I hope that you may he able to accept it. If, however, there are any further points in connection with the wording which you wish to raise, we might perhaps settle them in discussion. We agree -chat the Refinery Clause may he separated from the Political Agreement and may he made into an Agreement on its own. In the present revised draft I have accordingly added a preamble. There is one other point which you raise, namely, the /one eztenc o± the area 'to be covered by 'the Reifirery A 0 reenient. ^ou suggested, I thinl:, that it should merely co^er any Concession areas which the Company may have in iianrein, Qatar and the Trucial Coast. You suggested that tue xvOvveio x.eutral Zone and Muscat were too remote from this area to be included. I am afraid that we do not agree v.-icn you on this point, and you will see that I have tiie central Zone and Muscat in the final revised draco. We appreciate that if 500,000 tons of oil were produced by the Company of which a small proportion came from all these Sheikhdoms, it might not be a commercial proposition to set up a Refinery in any one of them. On the other hand, the Company’s total production might turn out to be in Muscat or in the Neutral Zone and oil might not be found in commercial quantities in the Trucial Coast area at all. In this event commercial considerations mi gat well permit of a Refinery being erected in Muscat territory. This, of course, is an extreme case and there might be any number of permutations or combinations which could only be judged in the light of existing circumstances when it comes to the point. It seems/i 4 seems to us that the Company would De lully saleg’uarded by the proviso in regard to commercial considerations. May I assume that, unless I hear from you to the contrary, you are prepared to -u^i^/up the draft in this form to your Bo ard&gt; in which case I will submit it here for approval.

Dear Clauson, With reference to your letter of September &amp;9th regarding the draft refinery clause Tor the Debai Political Agreement, I see no objection to having a refinery agreement between H.M. Government and the Company separate from the Political Agreements covering the individual concessions. As you point out in the fifth paragraph of your letter, such an Agreement would cover all concessions in the area in question which the Company may now or hereafter acquire. I think such an Agreement should cover the Koweit Neutral Zone as well as the Trucial Coast, Qatar and Bahrain, but we might leave out Muscat on account of its geographical position. With regard to the wording of the refinery clause itself, I do not think we can resist Longrigg*s suggested inclusion of a reference to commercial considerations, but it seems to me that there is a distinct advantage in retaining the words in paragraph one relating to the erection of a refinery with a total capacity M. J. Clausen, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.of not less than 250,000 tons of crude oil per annum as it affords an indication of the present intention of the parties to the Agreement# The new form of words'suggested by-Longrigg has some advantage over the Qatar formula as it places on the Company the onus of showing that they would he precluded by commercial considerations from erecting a refinery. I think it is important, however, that they should be asked to demonstrate this to the satisfaction of H.M. Government. What I am inclined to suggest,subject to the views of the Admiralty, is that firstly, Longrigg’s proposed addition should go at the end of paragraph one and secondly, (if we can get him to accept it) that it should be amended to read ’’unless the Company can show to the satisfaction of H.M. Government that they would be precluded, etc.” I see « - * - no objection to Longrigg’s other amendment adding the words ’’and scale and products of” in paragraph two.

In paragraph 4, I cannot help feeling that the suggested text is slightly out of touch with realities; ±f 9 for example, we have a geologist touring on the Trucial Coast, he will almost certainly find himself in greater or less contact with some of the six Trucial Coast Shaikhs, and will drink coffee with them, hire camels, arrange guards, etc. Perhaps it is not quite reasonable to ask him to do this in all cases through our Chief Local Representative. Do you think that at the beginning 01 tne paragraph, and between the words ’’the Company” and the words ’’shall deal”, we should insert some such phrase as ’’over all matters of importance or principle”, or ”in all except unimportant or routine matters”? LLi _j ?» -r Cr, o - 00 O Ui O UJ o &lt; o Q_ I—I Ui UJ Secondly, instead of saying ”he will be ordinarily resident in Bahrain” I suggest that we say ”he will be ordinarily resident in ••••••••••••• or Bahrain”• Thirdly, I can hardly visualise that all the Company’s relations with this or that Shaikh shall be conducted, through H.M.G.’s representative. In such very outlying places it seems to me difficult deliberately to exclude the possibility of direct relations between the Company ana the Shaikh. Is it not more a case for keeping H.M.G. s representative fully informed, and consulting him on all important issues? Even to-day, you will agree, our rela tions with these Shaikhs are not being conducted through H.M.G.’s representative.In your suggested paragraph 10, I do not much like the words 'in any case of dispute between the Shaikh and the Company', I should prefer 'in any case in which the Company feels that the free movement of its personnel within the concession area is being unnecessarily restricted'. The effect of the paragraph is, I admit, much the same, but the wording I suggest contains a reference to the fact that we shall, after all, have paid for the concession rights over the whole area. I note that you will be communicating with us separately about the Refinery Clause. I hope that this means that you are accepting my suggestion to separate the Refinery Agree ment (which affects the whole Arab side of the Persian Gulf containing ten potential concession units) from the Political Agreement which you and we are to make in respect of each individual such unit. It seems a matter from which the individual Shaikhs might very well be kept out and the same applies, of course, to the pre-emption clause. Yours sincerely. M.J.

Longrigg, who is, 1 -think, going away for a holiday at the end of this week heca raised the question again and is wtfy anxious to get an early decision. 1 took the liberty of showing him the revised draft with a view to seeing whether, subject to Admiralty approval, it would be acceptable to the Company. He acknowledged that it was an advance on the previous draft, but he felt very strongly that it still leaves the Company under the threat of having to erect a refinery^ even if it would mean losing a great deal of money over the proposition^merely to suit the convenience of H.M.G. , He said that the £&lt;VIV lAt /favCWrtA Company certainly be 1 quito roady pre^r a refinery if they had some COPY S”:T / AIR MAIL 1956 outlet in view for the refined products and he suggested that one method might * be for tanks to be put down adjacent to the refinery which would be Admiralty property (a rent being paid for them by the Admiralty) and would be kept filled :by the Company for Admiralty requirements.In that case the refinery need only be of a capacity sufficient to fill the tanks within a reasonable period and the amount of storage required would be laid down by the Admiralty. This, at first sight, seemed a promising idea, but on tr&gt;v* merely be a method of saying in other words that the Company would put up a refinery and store refined products provided the Admiralty would guarantee to buy the oil. 2. After some discussion Longrigg suggested the following possible A compromise between Governments requirements and the Company's interests. •He would suggest omitting everything after 'refineries' in the first paragraph and substituting 'unless the Company can show that this would be precluded by commercial considerations'. Instead of specifying the capacity in the first paragraph he would add after the words 'location for' in the first sentence of the s econd paragraph the woras 'and scale and products of'. 3. The object of these modifications would be to protect the Company from having to enter into an entirely uneconomic project, while leaving on them a definite obligation to erect a refinery tWdf oai fidhAtlij rth id' commerical considerations p ~rmi t _ ^ As regards the actual output of the refinery/Draft Paper. ^ 000^2 3G^ M YfiMi 4&gt;nr 'cT^ Department. refinery, the object is to leave this to be settled when the time comes in the ligh? of circumstances^e.g. H.M.G^s requirements, any provision that might m fa 4 A*** • 1 A ^ nK be made for local storage, available markets, etc/, 4 . As we are presumably agreed that H.M.G. would not, in fact, be able to insist on the Company erecting a refinery if it would mean a dead loss to them, 1 should have thought there was something to be said for adopting some kind of a compromise word®&amp; on the lines suggested. What we canttnr do, 1 imagine, is to alter the Qa^ar clause in such a way as to put on the Company a positive CAliJr A W{yt\ &gt; obligation to II.M.G»*o wishes unless commercial considerations forbid it instead of a rather ne g a t ive obligation to consider the matter a^A^/vn^ACA^/ L *~' 5. There are two other points which Longrigg has raised. (1) In regard to the area to which the refinery would refer, he assumed that we should not include the Koweit Neutral zone and Muscat. I said that I thought that we had in mind the Trucial Coast, Qatar and Bahrein. Do 5'QQ, 00c you agree that the 5-»006 tons should be reckoned on this basis? U *Mr QxfaCfc, ante* * caHajA l*j y (2) Longrigg feels rather strongly 4599 that /that it is desirable to have the Refinery Agreement between H.M.G. and the Company separate from the individual political Agreements covering the individual concessions. There is nothing in the Reiinery Agreement which needs the consent of the Sheikhs an d / it needs the consent of the Sheikhs and it might confuse their minds. Moreover, it might encourage them to exert embarrassing pressure on the Company to erect a refinery in their own particular Sheikhdom. I do not think there is very much in it either way, but presumably there will be no objection to having the Refinery Agreement separateand indeed it might be a more logical way of arranging matters than having it in each individual political Agreement. After all it is an agreement between H.M.G. and the Company covering all concessions which the Company may now or hereafter acquire in the area in question. Do you see any objection to having a separate Deed? (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSONIHDIA OFFICE, F.Z.6412/36. Co nfid ential WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 29th September, 1936. S.H.

Millbank, London, S.W. 1 In reply to your letter of 5th September, regarding the Refinery Clause to be inserted in the Political Agreements to be made with Petroleum Concessions, Limited, we have now given further consideration to this matter in the light of the information given in your letter and of Longrigg*s letter of 31st August. There is undoubtedly a real difficulty over this question of insisting on refineries / as demands are being made on the oil companies both in producing and consuming countries. We could therefore only reasonably require the erection of refineries in the areas of production if the refined products can be disposed of. With regard to the terms of the draft refinery clause, you will remember that this was put forward for consideration by the Conqpany after it had been tightened up a good deal, and M. J. Clauson, Esq., India Office, King Charles Street, S.W. 1. r ‘Q- P€L Bt&amp;T. , 19 SEP 1936 ND.A jfficeJSkliros said that he would do what he could with it and would revert to the subject as soon as he had obtained the reactions of the groups thereto* What seems to emerge from the correspondence is that the Company’s principal objection is to the indefinite commitment which the draft clause would impose on the Company, to continue to increase the capacity of the refinery from time to time so as to deal with half their total production, however large it might be. I think it is difficult to insist on this. I have drafted the enclosed alternative clause which if the other Departments agree, we might try on the Conpany. Yours sincerely,14^ Whenever the production of crude oil In-the areas in which the Company holds concessions in the Persian Gulf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the Company undertake to erect on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf within one of the said areas, or in any other place which may he approved by H # M # Government, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons of crude oil per annum.

The Company undertake to complete the refinery or refineries and put and maintain it or them in efficient working order with due diligence and dispatch but in any event within two years from the date on which the selection of the site or sites shall have been agreed between His Majesty’s Government and the Company.

However, when discussing somethin^ else a day or two a u o Longrigg asked whether we were now ready to talk about the efinory clause, and the question now lor deci8i.on is whether we dig our toes in on the present draft clause (which i xmagine we do not propose to do) or whether, and if so on what lines, we should discuss the matter with Longrigg. Would you kindly let ue have your viowe on the matter* If we are to have a talk with jjOiv.rigg preaumauly it had better be an interdepartmental affair/affair and it illicit be daairable to discutas beforehand the line to be taken with him.

Mr. Skliros promised in his letter dated May 29th to revert later to the subject of your proposed formula binding the Company (or, as it may be. Companies) to erect a refinery on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf, as part of the Political Agreement between it, or them, and the Government. Re has been unwell lately and his attendance at the office is, for the time, very irregular# He has asked me, therefore, to deal with the matter on his behalf. As he feared, the Board did not find acceptable the clause which you proposed in your letter PZ#3010/36 dated May 26th. The formula agreed for inclusion in the Qatar Agreement of June 5 th, 1936, makes the erection of a refinery conditional upon (a) com mercial production being, in the Company’s opinion, assured, and (b) commercial conditions justifying such a step. As regards (a), yotur Draft of May 26th generally meets this point. As regards (b), tnis is evidently the crux of the matter. If the Political Agreement, as ultimately signed, does not make the refinery conditional upon com mercial considerations, TT'seoms that it would be tantamount to saying 'the obligation to erect refineries is absolute, even though quite un justified by commercial considerations, and therefore liable to involve the Company in heavy loss'. It is the view of the Board that such an obligation could be accepted only with the greatest reluctance by a Company which had already made the efforts, taken the risks, and incurred the expenses necessary to the location and development of an oilfield. The Boardfoals that such offorts and expanses would have constituted already a very considerable service; it feels, moreover, and in more general terns, that the imposition of uneconomic burdens upon an industry, under the influence of Ctovernmental rather than commercial considerations, is much to be deprecated. It might, of course, very probably happen that the erection of a refinery or refineries, upon a scale to be determined at the time, might be commercially justifiable, or at least likely to involve no serious loss. In that event, there would be no reluctance on the part of the Company to erect refineries of commercially reasonable capacity* If you find it, after all, difficult to accept the formula of Article 9 of the Qatar Agreement as applicable to the Western and Southern shores of the Gulf in general, I suggest that we might pursue the subject by verbal discussion. tj.C• Walton ISsq*, C.S., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l*H.03641/36 -.1 p. z. 5957 iilitary Branch. 17th August, 1936.

We might, however, perhaps try the proposal of a clause on the definite lines suggested, and see how Skliros reacts to it.

In your letter of 30th January you suggested that, while the provisions of Clause 9 of the agreement of 5th June, 1935, relative to Qatar should be accepted as applicable to all the draft concessions, there should be an understanding that not more than one refinery is in question for the Persian Gulf area. We are prepared to agree that there ne&amp;a be no question of more than one refihery for the whole area m the Persian Gulf in which Petroleum Concessions Ltd. obtain concessions, but Clause 9\of the agreement between the Govt, and the A.P.O.C. regarding Qatar does not go\so far as we would like in the direction'of an undertaking to erecta \ ^14 refinery. That clause really does not amount to more than the expression of a ji \ pious hope of thA Coy.’s intention in certain contingencies. In the case of the various concessions for which P.C.L. are applying we would\like to have a clause in the corresponding Govt, agreement^ of a more definite character, and would suggest something\on the 'oil owing/following lines: that the Coy. would undertake to erect a refinery (one for the whole area and not, of course, one for the area of each concession) if the som total of the oil produced in the various concessions exceeded a certain fixed output, say 500,000 tons a year. lie contemplate suggesting a clause on these lines in drafting the various Go vt. agre ement s.f P. Z. 2078/3 6 . 3XPRESS LETTSR fAIR MAIL i From Secretary of State To Government of India. Repeated to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Political Agent, Bahrein. Dated 3rd April 1936. My telegram dated 1st April, No.1135, and connected correspondence regarding negotiations of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in Persian Gulf. 2. It seems desirable to proceed forthwith with drafting of political agreements between H.M.G. and the Company which will accompany the concessions to be negotiated with Sheikh of Bahrein and individual Trucial Sheikhs. Muscat agreement would no doubt follow similar lines, though question of having separate Chief Local Representative for Muscat may arise. 3. It will no doubt be simplest to conclude in respect of each Sheikhdom a separate agreement of a common form, similar to the Qatar Agreement, in which the following alterations appear to be necessary. ( a ) Para.1. Substitute for opening words 'The Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh shall not be transf erred M (b) Para.2. Omit up to first comma. Para.4 . Substitute 'The Company shall deal with the authorities through a chief local representative in the Persian Gulf who shall be a British subject. The approval of H.M.G. shall be required for the person so designated. He will be ordinarily resident in Bahrein and will be responsible for the Company’s local relations with the authorities, which shall be conducted/conducted through the Political Representative of H.M.G. in Bahrein or through any other person who^n the Political Resident may designate”.

(f) Para. 8 . Add at the end 'or their Agent'. (g) Para. 9. It will be necessary to insert a refinery paragraph in each Agreement which will cover the whole area. This will need careful wording; the following is suggested as first draft, but will in any case be subject to observations by Admiralty and negotiation with Company. ’’The Ccmpany declare that it is their intention to erect a refinery on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf whenever their total production of crude oil in this area totals 500,000 tons per annum. If and when this total production is achieved, the Company agrees to consult with H.M.G. as to the best location for a refinery. (h) A clause to the effect that any movements of the Company’s employees entailing special risks (e.g.penetration for/&amp; r- » 3. for more than a certain distance away frcm the coast) should be subject to the prior written permission of the Sheikh. ^In connection with this, provision should be made for placing, so far as possible, on the Sheikhs responsibility for protection of the employees and property of the Company; such provision could be included in the letters to be exchanged with the Sheikhs at the time of the conclusion of the 'political' agreements with the Company, and might be to the effect that in the event of any incident occurring the Sheikh would take all possible action against the culprits and pay any compensation which H.M.G. might consider necessary). 4. I should be glad of your observations as soon as possible on the above amendments, or your suggestions for other amendments, with a view to consideration in due course by H.M.G. The issue of the above has been authorised. (Sd.) J. C.Walton.Draft Paper. POLITICAL if P.Z. 20V8/36. Department. m 3 APR 1936 EXPRESS LBTTKR (AIR MAIL). P.O. Admiral A.M. Pet.

POL BEPT. 19DEC1936 INOiA Oi l- iCE |1. miT'JiHALL, S.'J. 16th December, 1936. My hear Longrigg, With reference to my telephone conversation with Lewisohn on Monday and to my letter of the 25th November No.P.Z.8415/36 to Mr. Skliros, I write to inform you that we sent off a telegram on Monday evening to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf authorising him to show and explain to the Sheikh of Debai the draft Political Agreement and draft Exchange of Notes, and to telegraph to us the Sheikh’s acceptance of the principles involved in them. I also confirm what I explained to Lewisohn on the telephone, namely, that in our telegram we put to Colonel Powle a suggestion that with reference to paragraph 3 (b) of the first draft letter to the Sheikh it might be desirable to secure from him a formal undertaking that he will be guided by the advice of His S.H. Longrigg, Esq., Majesty Petroleum Concessions Ltd. , City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E. C. 2. P.Z.3832/36Majesty’s Government in regard to the exercise of his right of termination. We requested Colonel Fowle ? if he thinks this is feasible, to endeavour to arrange it with the Sheikh. I understood that we need not anticipate any objection from the Company to this proposed addition, which would do no more than put into words what is already implicit, and would be a safeguard to the Company as well as to his Majesty’s Government. Vfe will, of course, let you know when we get Colonel Fowle ’ s reply, and vie will then be able to complete the Political Agreement. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) M. J. OLAUSOiVl ■—'—■ ; Minute Paper. POLITICAL Department. Mr.Wa^on, Replies have been received from the Admiralty and Petroleum Department to our letter of the 2nd December, P.Z. 7856/36. They concur. The Foreign Office Eastern Department apparently referred our letter to their Legal Adviser’s Department, and Mr.Beckett produced 4 pages of notes (copy below). The Foreign Office concurred some months ago in the draft political agreement and referred the matter to their Legal Department at the time. But Mr.Beckett was away. Hence it is the first time he personally has seen it. This explains the 11th hour comments, but it is hardly an excuse for the Foreign Office to expect us to rewrite the document at this stage! As Major Holmes left London on Thursday and as we are already committed up to the hilt to the Company, we can hardly reopen the question of the wording of the documents now. I wrote an urgent letter on Thursday evening to Mr.Rendel (copy below) which explains itself. In the light of it Mr.Renael telephones that they are^prepared Y to concur and they recognize that the responsibility is ours. They hope that Mr.Beckett’s points will be taken into consideration when we come to drafting the next Political Agreement. As you will see, I think two of Mr.Beckett’s points are good and can be met without dislocation of our plans, ur*: | They might be put to the Resident, to whom we must now ^ telegraph on the lines indicated in our letter to the Company of the 25th November, No.P.Z.8413/36.

Foreign Office. S*W.l r~ 11th December, 1936 Immediate. Sir I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you that he has considered your letter No.P.Z.7856/36 of 2nd December on the subject of the negotiations of Petroleum Concessions Limited for an oil concession from the Sheikh of Debai. 2. In the light of this semi-official consultation which has taken place between the Foreign Office and the India Office and in deference to the India Office views as expressed in the course of that consultation, Mr. Eden is prepared to concur in the procedure proposed in paragraph 3 of your letter under reference, and In the signature of the Debai Political Agreement and of the Refinery Agreement by an Under Secretary of State at the India Office on behalf of His Majesty's Government. 3. I am at the same time to draw attention to a clerical error in paragraph 9 of the Draft Political Agreement where the word 'Debai' requires to be substituted for the word 'Qatar'. I am Sir Your obedient Servant The Under Secretary of State India OfficeMy d«ar R«nd«l # ¥ ou spoke to me on the telephone this morning •bout eome eVMfgeetlone which your Leg*! AdTleer'e Department had made about the document* connected with the grant of the Deb&amp;i oil concession to Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and I hpve since had from Brenan a copy of Beckett's note on the subject. Beckett makes a number of useful suggestions and in ordinary circumstances we should probably agree thnt most or all of them should be adopted. The present circumstance* ere, however, rather difficult in th^t we hare already co^witted ourselves rather deeply to the Company in regard to the wording of the various documents. We h^ve 'Iso sent copies of the documents in their final form to the Culf and considerable dislocation will be caused if we redraft them at thie stage. In any cage it would eause considerable delay and we rre, 1 think, ell agreed that it i« mo't desirable to help P.C.L. to come to an e-rly settlement with the Sheikh o f ebai and subsequently U.W.Rendel, 3fn.,C.M.G., foreign Office.with the other TrucUl Sheikhs in order to forestall any danger of in tribes ngminnt them by other American competitors. ^oreower Major Holmes hnS already left Zfrr London on hi^ way back to the Gulf. In ell the circur stances it would be exceeding! embarrassing for u* to reopen with the Company the ouestion of the wording of the various documents, *nd * &lt;3 r ; -ould not t eel justified in doing so unless thers is tny point of real substance involved. Lay 1 now take Beckett 1 * note in detail in the lif^ht of wh't I hrve said above* £&amp;££■*» * to 3 It is the case, as is stated in parser-ph S that the second alternative is what in essence is intended, and strictly speaking Article 11 of the i©litical Agreement ought perhaps to be in the correspondence with the Sheikh, but while the arrangement actually adopted is slightly untidy it clearly does effect what we want to do and we do not feel thnt it is necessary to alter it particularly se it is based on the qatar model. ££££,.»,*i. We agree with Beckett and will request ^owle to make sure that something is put in writing at the/the time of tHe signature of the commercial conceeeion to the effect that this ie subject to Hie Wajeety'e GoYem** ent’a approral. iara. 5. T&gt;iie ie n point which we will eonei'ler urgently (there may be something on the Koweit or $at*r files)and unless there is soma clear reason to the contrary we will suggest to fowle the desirability of getting some sort of formal undertaking from the Sheikh to the effect that he will exercise his right of determination on Hie Majesty 1 « Oorernment’e advice in the event of their informing him that .^Political Agreement hns been broken by the Company* Such * n arrangement would of course be bilateral between gis Majesty's Government and the Sheikh and need not therefore affect our tripartite arrangements with the Company. Para.6. We agree. Paras. 7 ^nti 8. These amendments appear to be merely verbal and are covered by what was said in the first paragraph of this letter. Para.». I do not thin th^t the intention of this Article is really clear to Beckett. The intention is/4. if» thst Article 10 should override the provisions of the eowmercisl concession under which it will probably, as beckett points out, be open to the Company to work roughly speaking in any aree and state. It is laid down in the exchange of notes that in any pnrticul r in which the Political Agreement conflicts with the cowmerciel concession the former shall override the letter and this is what will happen in the present instance. The wording of Article 10 was worked out in sane detail with the Company. They fully understand ^nd h ve accepted It in its present form. With regard to the last sentence of Beckett's note we did not feel th«t it was really n#eees*ry to add an arbitration clause to the refinery agreement in view of the fact that the agreement as it stands really leaves the Company in His Majesty's Government's hands (see ?or instance the words 'unless the Company can show to the eatisf ction of Hie Majesty's Government' in Article 1). In any case we ^re all agreed th*?t this question is to some extent an academic one, since Hie Majesty's Sowernment will not in practice be able to force/^ 5. fore* tH« Company to •reel »nd work a raflnery in tim# of poaeo unlaois eorrasarcial con^idorations justify it, whilo on tbo other hand if commercial consideration* do justify it no difficulties should srlse on the Company* s side. You will see that we propose to meet wh^t appear to us to be the substantial points in Beckett’s note, and in all the cireunatancee we very much nope that you will now feel able to answer our official letter of the 2nd December. Yours sincerely. ft Sc.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001b8_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3872</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001b8</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3872</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/138 'Oil: Debai Political Agreement and Refinery Agreement.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-01-10T22:41:02</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (183 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 184; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
