SUMMARY OF EVENTS IN TURKISH IRAQ FOR THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY 1914. I.—Internal Affairs. (a) Baghdad Vilayet. 1. The lull which prevailed during the month of May continued throughout June and up to about the end of July when news of the outbreak of war between Austria and Servia provided a subject of conversation in the town. 2. During June and July the following military units were sent southwards :— 20 Infantry left by the SS. “ Burhaniyeh ” for Basra on the 23rd June ; 60 Infantry left by the same steamer on the 8th July also for Basra ; 22 Infantry with 2 mules left on the 17th July by the SS. “ Basrah ” for Basra ; 200 Infantry left for Shahtra on the 27th July by the SS. “ Burhaniyeh ” 200 Gendarmes and 10 Infantry left by the SS. “ Hamidiyeh ” on the 29th July. Destination unknown. They carried with them about 75 boxes of ammunition ; On 1st July 450 rifles and 18 boxes of ammunition were shipped to Basra ; On 10th July Colonel Subhi Bey left for Basra to take up the posts of Military Commandant and Wali of Basra. 3. It transpires that the despatch of troops in May * last was to prevent a * See Summary for May 1914, Nos. i-2. quarrel between the Arabs of Amarah and , , . . those of Kut which the Wali of Baghdad thought imminent. It did not however have the desired effect as it was subse- quently found necessary to bring the Sheikhs of both factions to Baghdad, where they were placed under detention. They are not imprisoned but are strictly forbidden to leave the city. J 4. On the 4th June the Wali of Baghdad issued orders for the election of mem- t£ee Summary for September 1913, Nos I 19. for the new j' General Council of the Vilayet of Baghdad. 5. The following are the other items of local interest (a) The appointment on 6th June, as Qadhi of Baghdad, of Ibrahim Shawq Bey, President of the Civil Bidayet Court.

This was the result °f an intrigue between Djemal Pasha (late V ali) Grabowsk ; 1 &gt; the Imperial Ottoman Bank Manager, who both bore him persona grudges. Sevian Bey is a man of the highest integrity and ability. He has been offered appointments in the new Company ° f ^ and als ° “ Lord Incha P e ’ s (&lt;I)_The dismissal of the Qaim-Maqams of Kadhimain and Najef and the nhfce 1 o f f n ti nt f° f tt6 Ba ^ d Commandant of Gendarmes in the FW, ; en f T er BehlJ Bey ’ “-Commissioner of Police at Basra, in the place of the latter.' 2 of the graves has given rise to much offence. At the suggestion of the President of the Municipality convict labour was requisitioned to fill up the moat. On the third day six of the convicts made a dash for liberty. The Gendarmes in charge shot two dead, the other four escaping. During the firing two workmen were* accidentally wounded. 7. On the 7th July the M ali visited Kadhimain addressing the notables there on the subject of education. One of the Killidars of the shrine being impressed with His Excellency s speech presented the Government with a plot of ground for the erection of a school. The ground is said to be worth £ T. 450 and the build ings already on the site about £ T. 250. 8. Lawlessness still prevails in the city. In June nine murder cases were reported, while in July ten cases of burglary are said to have occurred at Saiyid Idris, a suburb of Baghdad. 9. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala reports the removal of the Turkish arsenal from Karbala to Hillah. He states that the military authorities propose in future to make Baghdad, Najef and Hillah centres for the storage of arms and ammunition. 10. Saiyid Jawad*, Killadar of Najef, died there on the 12th June. The * &amp;ee Summary for October 1913, No. IV-5. Vice-Consul in reporting the occurrence adds “ His death will now be a cause of much benefit to the Turkish authorities, who will let the vacant post by auction to the highest bidder. ” On the 24th June the Vice-Consul reported that the son of the deceased Killa dar, Saiyid Muhammad Hasan, had made the following offers to the Wali of Baghdad for the vacant post:— (o) payment of a sum of £ T. 1,500 towards the Baghdad University, f (b) erection outside the town of Najef t See paragraph 12 Mra. ,° f a , S g ai (secretariat offices) for the Government; (c) the erection of two Gendarmerie stations between Najef and Kufa ; and (d) the building of a school at Najef to be named after his deceased father. Under date 8th July, the Vice-Consul reported that Saiyid Muhammad Hasan had obtained the Killidarship on payment of a lump sum of £ T. 4,000 for public purposes, plus a secret donation of £ T. 1,000 for division among the officials of Baghdad and Najef. 11 12 13 11. On the 17th June, the Vice-Consul reported that the V ali had, under orders from Constantinople, prohibited all public preaching at the shrines unless the preachers had provided themselves with a license from the Mufti. The order created some dissatisfaction among the public, who at once attributed it to the Com mittee of Union and Progress as an attempt on their part to'abolish all religious ceremonies. For two successive nights Gendarmes prevented public preaching at the shrines, but on the Mutasarrif hearing that arrangements for an attack on the Gendarmes had been organised, the prohibition was quietly withdrawn. 12. The inhabitants of Karbala and Najef appear to be inundated with subscriptions for the late war, the wounded, the Navy, and for air-ships. On the 19th June, they were asked to subscribe towards the erection of a University at Baghdad. The Wali is said to have sent a comprehensive list of names of the inhabitants to the Mutasarrif of Karbala with orders that he should summon them to his presence and demand from each sums varying from £ T. 20 to £ T. 100. The sum which each one had to pay had been filled in by the v ali and the Mutasarrif had no option but to demand from each individual the sum noted opposite his name. The Wali also sent two special officers to Sheikh Muhammad Kazim Yezdi of Najef requesting his assistance on behalf of the University. 13. The Vice-Consul reports that the local authorities propose selling the valuable Persian carpets in the shrine at Najef and making over the proceeds to the Owqaf Department. The carpets are said to be worth about £ 1. 20,000.14. The Mutasarrif of Karbala visited Shafatha on the 12th July in connection with the scheme of erecting Gendarmerie stations between Shafatha and Karbala. He fixed the site at a place called Dikhna, and the proposed building will be large enough to accommodate 20 men. The Mutasarrif also proposes to erect brick pillars en route to prevent travellers losing their way across the desert. Both schemes have been submitted to the Wali for approval as the provision of the necessary funds lies with him. 15. On the 13th July news reached Karbala of the death of the well-known Mujtahid of Ispahan, Agha Najafi. The “ Fatiha ” ceremony which lasted five days was held at Karbala at the house of the deceased’s brother, Haji Agha Nur ullah, and was attended by a numerous crowd of the Shiah persuasion. The Vice- Consul remarks that by the death of Agha Najafi “ Persia has lost her best, most religious and popular Mujtahid. ” 16. About the middle of July the local authorities at Karbala began distributing Martini-Henry rifles to the land-owners there for the protection of their property. Each such proprietor was given from one to seven rifles and from 100 to 700 cart ridges, according to the extent of his property. The only cash payment demanded was a sum of Reige Piastres 56 (about £ 0-2-4) for each rifle, and a receipt was given to the Tabour Aghassi to the effect that should the rifle be lost or damaged payment of £ T. 2i will have to be made. The Vice-Consul adds that “ every one who has a plot of land is anxious to obtain this decoration and carry it without fear. ” 17. The President of the Karbala Municipality proposes to light the bazaars with incandescent lamps. Funds are as usual lacking, but the President, w ith the approval of the Mutasarrif, proposes to obtain the money required by subscriptions from the shop-keepers who are to benefit by the scheme. Each shop-keeper will be called to pay from 20 to 80 Reige Piastres (about 10^. to 3s. 4d.). The list w~as sent round on the 16th July and the Vice-Consul warned British subjects to refuse payment until the Municipality had referred the question to him. 18. On the night of the 23rd July (the Ottoman Fete day) a demonstration occurred at Najef. A preacher at one of the courtyards of the shrine had about 250 women for his audience. An employe of the Municipality (in conformity with the instructions noted* above in connection with a similar episode at Karbala) , ,, ordered him to desist. This so enraged the * See par&lt;„grap i n mpra. women that they marched in a body to the Sarai, destroying the illuminations in the bazaars en route. More women joined them on the way and on arriving at the Sarai they threw stones at the Qcim-Maqam’s residence and abused and reviled the Turkish Government. The Qaim-Maqam endeavoured to appease their wrath by promises and threats but finding neither effectual he ordered the Gendarmerie to fire blank cartridges at the w r omen. Quiet was however not restored until the Qaim-Maqam issued orders to permit the preach er to continue his sermo.n. The preacher w^as arrested the following day and sent to Baghdad. Enquiries are now on foot to trace the real instigators of this demon stration and some six men are said to have been so far imprisoned. 19. The subscriptions collected at Karbala on account of the Navy Fund amounted, at the end of July, to about £ T. 145. (5) Basra. 20. On the 30th May Mr. Bullard (acting British Consul at Basra) reported that the Minister of the Interior had telegraphed to Saiyid f Talib offering him a t See Summaiy for February-March 1914, choice of three posts, viz. Ambassador, V' ali, No. 1—29. ’ or a Member of the Senate. Mr. Bullard w^as of opinion that Saiyid Talib was nominally on very good terms with the Turks and that the Government was only seeking a chance to arrest him and that Saiyid Talib realising the delicacy of his position preferred to remain at Basra where a numerous body-guard of armed men stood between him and airest. 21. Considerable excitement prevailed at Basra for several days about the middle of June owing to an alleged “ attack ” on tie town by Muntafic Arabs. A great deal of firing w'as heard on the night of the 15th June and the explanation givenwas that a band of Muntafic from 60 to 80 strong approached Basra from Zubeir to attack the city, but had retired after exchanging shots with the guard, leaving one ot their number dead. ^ The W all sent a force of some 600 men with 6 mins tn Zubeir to find the “ brigands ” responsible for the attack, and these were accom pamed by scores of Saiyid Talib’s followers. Some fighting took place at Zubeir several soldiers and Arabs being wounded, but the town was soon occupied bv the dedared ^ ^ 1 ^ ^ Went t0 Zubeir ’ wliere martial lavfwas o • ^Vru Bu ! Iard WaS0f ?

Mr. Bullard in his report to the Embassy about the attack on Basra wrote of Saiyid Talib as follows Talib ba s impressed the Government with the extent of his authoritv and established a claim on their gratitude by assisting them at an appar- ently critical moment; the redoubtable band of Turkish soldiers is reduced by drafts to Baghdad and Amarah, by discharges and sick ness, to a third of its original number, while the Wali, thanks to such favours as the permanent loan of a carriage and a free daily supnlv of ice and to the natural subordination of a weak character to a strong one, is nothing but Talib’s Aide-de-Camp. This change in Talib s fortunes is the more remarkable from the fact that he is a compara tively poor man and can only meet the expense of his Robin Hood generosity to the poor and of his large retinue by levying blackmail on all his wealthy compatriots at Basra. ” (c) Mosul. Vice-ConSr^a^MoTd -- ^ ^ ^ tte our (a) The 1st Battalion of the 103rd Regiment returned from Rawanduz to Regiment 1 be6n replaced h y the lst Battalion of the 104th (b) Sami Bey, the Chief Engineer in charge of the Public orks, has been dismissed by the Wah on the ground that about £ T. 27,000 had been spent by him on the two bridges over the Zab and another over the river Khazar, and that the works were not yet completed. Subse quently the \V ah ordered Sami Bey’s arrest and trial. Orders how ever arrived from Constantinople appointing Sami Bey Chief Erei- neer for the Yemen on a salary of £ T. 40 per mensem. At Mosul he received £ T. 2 &gt;. Sami Bey has since left Mosul for Yemen. (c) The Wali also dismissed the Qaim-Maqam of Arbil, who is said to have been the cause of some bloodshed between the Arabs and Kurds at ^ ° f ^ ^ h * S been ^ -t as Q tim- w Tb :S?rM„ o iS ul l “ ! •&gt;» .i r.ii&lt;. (e) One Sheikh Himaidi with 160 horsemen arrived in the Mosul Vilayet from Baghdad, ostensibly under the orders of the V ali of Baghdad to collect certain taxes from the Shammar Arabs. The W ali of Mosul on hearing of this sent 40 Gendarmes under an officer to arrest the Sheffih .ndbrmg him to Mosul. He also sent his own official to o ect the tax in question from the Shammar. Soon after the Sheikh’s arrest orders arrived from Constantinople to the Wali to release im. T e \\ ah replied that the Sheikh was a notorious robber whohad plundered people to the extent of £ T. 15,000 and until this sum was forthcoming he would not release him. On again receiving per emptory orders from headquarters to immediately release the Sheikh, the Wali asked that a successor should be appointed to relieve him as he declined to release the Sheikh. The YNali’s resignation was accepted, but the President of the Municipality and the Chaldaean Patriarch have telegraphed to Constantinople asking that the Wali may be permittied to remain at his post. II. —British Interests and Cases. 1. Messrs. Young and McCormick, Chartered Surveyors, arrived here about ♦ See Summary for August 1913, No. II-4. ^ Ju ’y in connection with the Baghdad * Tramways and Electric Lighting Syndicate. III. — British Indian Interests. Nil IV. —British Official Matters. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Erskine, who has been ailing ever since his arrival at Baghdad in November 14th, fell seriously ill with pleurisy on June 13th. His condition for a time gave rise to serious doubts as tq his recovery. He left Baghdad on the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” on July 11th en route for Karachi and Europe. Under orders from the Government of India I assumed charge of the Residency and Consulate-General from June 25th. V.— Persian Affairs. 1. On the 14th June the Vice-Consul at Karbala reported that in connection with the approaching coronation of the Shah two reactionaries had left Persia to interview the Mujtahids at Karbala and Najef. Their object was to create an agi tation in connection with the coronation of the young Shah and to try and give the ex-Shah one more chance of regaining the throne. The Vice-Consul said that the Regent had telegraphed to the Persian Consul-General and to the Mujtahids warn ing them against these two individuals. On the 24th July one of them, Sheikh Mahmood, arrived at Karbala, but he received a chilling reception from the Mujtahids. The students combined to get the Turkish authorities to banish him. 2. Towards the end of July local merchants received news that the Baghdad- Kermanshah route was open to traffic and that the Firman Firma had 250 horse men patrolling the route. VI.— Foreign Interests other than British and Persian. 1. Abul Qasim, the Russian Agent at Karbala, has been informed that the Order of the Lion and Sun, 2nd class, has been conferred on him by the Persian Government. The Vice-Consul thinks that this is evidently in recognition of the services rendered by him to the Persians during the trouble in Persia. 2. Muhsin, son of Mehdi Quli Shirwani of Kadhimain, has been appointed Dragoman of the Russian Vice-Consulate at Karbala. 3. Dr. Abdul Rahmanf Farhadoff, the newly appointed Russian Vice-Consul + c g f a f ift 14 at \tt a Karbala, has not yet taken up his t Summary for May 1914, No. VI-4. , i i residence there, and the Vice-Consul reports that he is not expected to do so till after the Ramazan feast. 4 4. News of the outbreak of war between Austria and Servia reached Baghdad at the end of July. VII.— General. 1. On the 30th June news was received here of the assassination of the Austrian Heir-Apparent and his wife. The flags of this Residency and of the R. I. M. S.•V 6 “ Cometwere immediately half-masted and kept at half-mast till the afternoon of the 1st July. I called on my Austrian Colleague on the same afternoon to express my condolences and he returned my visit on the morning of the 1st July. 2. On the 4th July the Residency flagstaff and the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” were dressed in honour of the Independence Day of the United States of America. No reception was held at the American Consulate in honour of the occasion. 3. On the 14th July the Fete day of the French Republic, I attended a recep tion at the French Consulate between 81 and 9 a.m. The Residency flagstaff was dressed during the day. 4. On the morning of the 15th July news was received of the sad death of Lady Hardinge. The Residency flagstaff was immediately halfmasted and the offices closed. 5. The Coronation and Birthday of H. I. M. the Shah was celebrated on July 21st. I attended the official reception held at the Persian Consulate-General between 7 and 8 a.m. In the evening the Persian Consul-General gave a general reception to the Notables and leading Europeans of Baghdad. The Residency flagstaff was dressed during the day. 6. The Ottoman National Fete was celebrated on the 23rd July. The official reception which I attended took the form of a review of the troops of the garrison at 7 a.m. The Wali visited the tent of the Consular Corps to receive their congra tulations. The Residency flagstaff was dressed and the Residency illuminated after sunset.

The principal incidents of a somewhat uneventful month have been: (a) the almrst weekly despatch of troops of sorts in the direction of Basra ; (b) the dismissal of a number of officials; and (c) the strike of the butchers in Baghdad city. 2. As regards (a) supra, 210 infantry* left by the “Musal” on the 11th, and 100 more infantry* followed a week later in the ♦Mostly raw recruits. “ Burhaniyeh ”. On the 23rd May, 180 trained infantry were despatched by steamer and 70 cavalry left by road, while the 29th May witnessed the departure of 85 gendarmes and 100 more trained infantry. It is believed that the cavalry had orders to go to Kut, and the 180 trained infantry to Shatrat-al-Muntafic, while the rest were bound for Basra. 3.

The new Qadhi of Baghdad city is ’Umar Hifzi Effendi of Dr. mascus. Salah-ud-Din (above mentioned) is perhaps the most prominent member of the local branch of the Committee of Union and Progress. He is said to have been dismissed for “ bad conduct ” and to have been fined a Mejidieh (£-0-3-4) for being drunk. 4. The strike of the butchers was due to an increase in the slaughter-house fees and, while it lasted, caused some inconvenience. 5. Major Ismail Haqqi Beyhas arrived from Constantinople to be Command ant of the gendarmes vice Major Irfan Bey§, who is apparently still acting as §See Summary for February 1914, LG.

Wali has received orders lb inerease the num ber of gendarmes here and the Commandant has issued a notice that 200 mounted gendarmes are required. 6. The people of Mendeli are said to have submitted a petition to the local authorities complaining that the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission have given a large slice of their land to Persia and praying that, if their own land cannot be restored, they may be given land of equal area, etc., from the Persian side. 7 8 7. The present Chief of the Staff, 13th Army Crops, appears to be Major (or Lieutenant-Colonel) Sami Bey. I understand that Major Beha-ud-Din Bey^j «jSee Summary for February-March 1914, the former Chief of the Staff, has been placed 1 . 22 . on special duty in connection with Basra and Hasa affairs. 8. The case of Aziz Bey-el-Masri attracted comparatively little attention here, but on the 17th May, while church service was being held at the Residency, Mr. Ahmad Rouchdy, an engineer on the Baghdad Railway, called on me and left C232FD2 his card with a pencil message (in French) on it thanking (through me) the “ British nation ” for having intervened in the matter and brought about justice, etc. (b) Basra Wilayat. 9. In my last summary* I mentioned that Hamad bin Sa’dun (brother of ’Ajaimi) and Muhammad-el-Asaimi, with ♦See last Summary, 1.12. &amp; £ ew f 0 p 0Wers&gt; were the guests of the Wilayat in a house at Basra near the Ottoman Bank. They were soon joined by Tamir (another brother of ’Ajaimi) and more armed retainers. According to Mr. Crow, 50 armed men had been brought in by the 5th May without apparently any protest or objection on the purt of the Wali. The two brothers called several times at the Sarai accompanied by their own guard and, though the Mudir of Police, foreseeing trouble, warned the guard not to carry arms in the Sarai, the Muntafics seem to have paid no attention. On the evening of the 5th May, Saiyid Talib returned to Basra from the businesst w'hich had taken him to Koweit and, collecting 250 armed men tSee last Summary, 1 . 14 . 0 f own? proceeded direct to the house (belonging to Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah) in which the Wali resides. He appears to have told the latter that, unless he immediately turned the two brothers and their retinue out of Basra, there would be bloodshed, and further that, until the above were effected, he himself would not enter the town. His Excellency the Wali seems to have given way at once, and the Muntafic party left in carriages for Zobeir the same night. ’ Ajaimi is not unnaturally incensed at this treatment of his brethren, and is supposed to be contemplating an attack on Zobeir and Basra, 10. Looking to what happened last year, J the Wali seems to have been in- , T T1 discreet and blameworthy in allowing the }See Summary for June 1913,1.1. armed men of the Muntafic into Basra. Saiyid Talib is described to me as dominating the situation throughout the Walayat ; some say he is about to be made a Wali and others an Ambassador or Vice-President of the Senate ! The Mudir of Police who, as noted above, did try and prevent trouble seems to have been the principal sufferer as he was “ summarily dismiss ed ” by the Wali. 11. The Commission which was sent to Koweit to effect a settlement with Ibn Sa’ud§ returned to Basra early in May. Apparently Ibn Sa’ud declined to dis cuss the question of El Hasa, remarking §See last Summary, 1.14. the province was his and that there was nothing more to be said ! He accepted from Sami Bey!| Mutasarrif of Hasa and representing the Minister of War, I|See last Summary, . . ^ letter, a revolver and a Koran and in return sent Enver Pasha (through the same channel) his own particular dagger and a message which is said to have been to the effect that Hasa was his property and he proposed to keep it. 12. It would appear that when the Wali and Ibn Rashidlf met near Suqush Shuyuk and Nasiriyah last April, the ^See last Summary, 1 . 12 . former asked the latter whether he could, if necessary, reconquer Hasa and restore it to the Turks. Ibn Rashid is said to have expressed his ability to do so with the co-operation of 200 Turkish soldiers. Ibn Sa’ud seems to have heard of this conversation and to have informed Ibn Rashid (and ’Ajaimi) that he was no longer their friend and that they must expect trouble. 13.

(ii) Maruf-el-Ressafi, an editor of an Arabic newspaper at Constantinople and a poet; otherwise an ordinary person. (Hi) Kurish Effendi, a native of Kirkuk, who was'formerly chief clerk of the Administrative Council of ’Amarah ; a man without education or private means, and, according to Mr. Crow’s informant, of a somewhat fanatical temperament. All the above are members of the Committee of Union and Progress. 16 Mr Crow handed over charge of the British Consulate at Basrah to Mr. Bullard on the 23rd May and left for Europe. (c) Mosul W Hay at. 17 As’ad Pasha, Commander of the 12th Army Corps, has at last§ got what he r XT TWpmher 1913 w T anted, viz., a transfer. He has been gaz- an 8 d^nu™ 4 ! 0 “ etted as Commander of the 5th Army Corps and left Mosul towards the end of May. 18. The Wall has had some more of the Barzan|| Shaikh’s men arrested and imprisoned and has seized their flocks of II See last Summary 1. 21 . sheep, etc. The Shaikh is reported to be still at Urumiyah, but the Wali gives out that the Persian Government will shortly surrender him. 19. A couple of officers from Constantinople are touring in the district buying horses for the cavalry ; they appear to have £ T. 10,000 to spend on behalf of Govern ment. 20. Mahmud^ Pasha, Chief of the Jaf Kurds, and his brother, Muhammad Ali , . T , Bey, arrived at Mosul about May 20th to *1 See Summary for Marc i- pn , • • di scuss certain questions with the Wali. 21. The Dragoman in charge of our Vice-Consulate reports (a) the arrival from Odessa of a Russian with a name like “ Forba”, who appears to be interested in anti quarian remains ; (b) the departure on four months’ leave of the French Vice-Consul, and (c) some apparently high-handed acts on the part of the Wali towards certain British Indians. Regarding the last named, I am taking such action as is possible at this distance and on the scanty material before me. The absence of a British ** See Summary for February-March 1914, Vice-Consul at Mosul Continues** to be 1.26. “ felt. f II. —British interests and cases. 1. The local authorities recently seized a British subject, Shaikh Muhammad Jawad, Kashmiri, at Samarrah and*put him into prison preparatory to making him serve in the Turkish army. They would not let him communicate with me by tele gram, but he managed to get a petition through. On looking into the case, I ascertained that about a year ago the Turks claimed him as an Ottoman subject and would have made him serve in the Turkish army had he not been the sole supporter of his family. The case came before my predecessor because Muhammad Jawad claimed to be a British subject and declined to pay the local road-tax. Correspond ence ensued and as no answer was received to the Consul-General’s letter of the 14th May 1913 (in which Mr. Lorimer explained why he held Muhammad Jawad to be a British subject) it was believed that the local authorities were satis fied about the man’s British nationality. When therefore I heard of the man’s incarceration in the military prison at Samarrah, I immediately drew the V ali’s attention to the correspondence of last year, etc., etc., and His Excellency lost no time in telegraphing orders for the man’s release. 2. Considerable inconvenience is felt by the Ottoman Government introducing new taxes, etc., and raising existing taxes, etc., without any previous warning. I trust that it may be found possible to supply me with a copy of every law, order. -4 or regulation which is likely to affect British subjects in these parts. No such copy is to be had here. 3. The Wall is demanding 20 yams (1 penny) Hedjaz Railway stamp on every ticket of admission to the Cinematograph Theatre of Blockey, Cree and Company. I have asked him under what law and what section of that law the demand is pre ferred. On an earlier occasion the authorities insisted on a “ special theatre stamp ” of 20 yams (1 penny) being affixed to each ticket of admission, Mr. Cree declined to comply on the ground that in Constantinople Cinematograph tickets had to bear no such stamp. III.— British Indian interests. 1. Opinions seem to differ as to whether the Pilgrim guides posted at Basra, Baghdad, Kadhimain, Karbala, Musaiyi\ Najaf, and Samarrah are or are not doing *See Summary for Novembcr-December and useful work. When I first arrived here 1913 and January9i4, HI. i, some six months ago,* I heard nothing but praise of them but, speaking generally, the reverse is now the case. It is very easy for a guide to be dishonest, and it is very difficult to prove that he has been. One receives a complaint from a pilgrim just before he returns to India ; it is taken down in writing ; there is no documentary evidence (e.g. a receipt) to support it; and it is impossible to bring together the pilgrim and the guide or guides complained against. All that can be done is to send the complaint to the Vice-Consul for enquiry, etc., and the guide of course denies in toto the charge brought against him. People have been recently telling me that the expenses of pilgrims in Turkish Iraq are heavier now than they were before these guides were introduced. On the other hand, there is not the slightest reason to believe that every complaint against a pilgrim guide is a true one ; these men have, I know, many enemies. The matter will continue to receive my attention and, for reasons given in the late Mr. Lorimer’s ^ , -j-, . p , letter No. 1137,t dated the 15t November his despatch No. 1136-30, dated the loth idem* 1913, to^ the Oovernment of India, I shall not be in a hurry to introduce important innovations, etc. IV.— British official matter. 1. As promised in my last summary I give below an account of the recent Oudh Bequest distributions at Karbala and Najaf. Total sum for distribution, £ T. 4, 529',21 7, viz .— A t Nmrt f At Najaf, 2,264,631 2,235,659 22,578 6,394 224,207 896,820 11,14,632 Amount actually distributed Commission at 1 per cent Held over for next distribution Details of distribi-tion. 1 Mujtahid-Distributor 6 Mujtahid-Distributors Others At Karbala. 2,264,586 i 2,215,178 22,646 26,762 160,142 ,. .. 960,828 10,94,208 (Theexpression“ Others ’’includes allowances to Residency Members, subscription to the school, miscellaneous charities, cost of getting small coins in exchange for Liras, etc., etc.) The following are further details of the amount distributed among “ Others’* at either place viz .—• Najaf.

The above were normal distributions, i.e., they included no arrears of previous half years. Of the total sum distributed, one-half (£ T. 2,242 odd) was given to the fourteen Mujtahid-Distributors, and it may be taken as certain that practically nothing out of the sum last mentioned went beyond the Mujtahid-Distributors and their families. Then again many of the Distributors—particularly at Karbala— never attend Committee meetings or distributions in person but send proxies. I have told them that this is quite wrong and will not be permitted in future. Com- mittee books have been started and in them are entered the minutes of each meeting, the names of those present, etc. I shall reduce the “ one-half ” now given to the Mujtahid-Distributors to “ one-third ” as soon as I get a good chance. 3. Lieutenant Withers, R. I. M., Assistant to the Intelligence Officer, Persian* ♦Sec Summary for November-Decembec 1913 Oulf, was at Baghdad for a few da^S about and January 1914, IV. «. May 23rd to try and find out whether there had been any fresh developments in the gun-running business. 4. The usual statement showing work done at the Residency Dispensary is attached and marked “A”. V.—Persian Affairs. 1. His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah writes that, “according to a letter received from the local authorities”, the road between Kermanshah and the Turkish frontier is “ now in order”, and caravans are proceeding. He adds that there is still a dispute between the authorities and some of the tribes, but negotiations are in progress and it is hoped that the tribal forces will disperse._ The latter, who are at a distance from the road, protest their loyalty and promise not to interfere with caravans. From a private source at Baghdad I hear that the Hamaw^andf tribe have joined or are about to join the tSee last Summary, 1.22. other Kurdish tribes who live in these regions and will shortly commit excesses on this trade-route. VI.—Foreign Interests other than British or Foreign. 1. It turns out that the Dr. ’Abdul Rahman J w T ho, according to our Vice' ♦See Summary for February-March 1914, Consul at Karbala, Was shortly to be Rus- V1.1. sian Vice-Consul at that town, is the same gentleman who called on me in April and who described himself on his card as ttt Mr. A. Farkhaty§, Russian Vice-Consul at §See last Summar .v&gt; • 2 - Najaf. He proceeded from here to Karbala, w T here he called himself Dr. ’Abdur Rahman Farhadoff and remained for the most part incognito. Khan Bahadur Muhammad Hasan (British Vice-Consul at Karbala) made enquiries and reports thus about Dr. ’Abdur Rahman: “ When settled, he will work directly under the Embassy and the Foreign Ministry, in which depart ment he is said to be very respectable and of more influence than Mr. Orloff and his successor. When he arrived at Baghdad, he found that the Najaf ” agent is given no pay and that the recommenda- Summary for Fehruary-March 1914, tiong o{ Messrg _ Orloff and Popoff in favour of an allowance of 10 Liras a month had yet remained fruitless. He immediately wdred to St. Petersburgh and within two days a telegraphic order was received for the regular payment to him of Liras 15 a month «TSee Summary for February-March 1914, as pay and Liras 5h as office allowance. V1L The Doctor’s own pay^l has been raised to Liras 60 a month plus Liras 20 for office expenses.” It would seem that the new r Russian Vice-Consul is going to live at Karbala, where he has taken a fine house on a rent of £T.40 a year. His Consular duties will not tire him as there are, I believe, only 33 Russian subjects (of sorts) at Karbala. The number at Najaf is about 300, the majority being students. It is stated that the Russians want to start Vice-Consulates at Kadhim.ain (a suburb of Baghdad), Samarrah, and Khanaqin because Russian pilgrims frequent those places and that the Turks are opposed to any new institutions. ||See vu. 2. The Baghdad-Somaicha branch of the Baghdad Railway was opened with out formality of any kind on June 1st. There is one train a day each way and, including three stoppages, it takes nearly tw T o hours to cover some 41 miles.6 3. A couple of Germans have visited these parts during the month, mz., a Mr. Karl Figdor and a Dr. V. Weickhmann. The former is a go-ahead young fellow connected with some biggish paper in Berlin ; he is travelling through Persia to study the methods of Russian Consular officers there and see generally what the Russians are doing. He said he was in want of a servant who could speak either English or French or German and asked me if I knew of a handy man. I put him on to two men, one of whom turned out to be the Russian Consul-General’s Qawas and the other the Austrian Consul’s Head cook ! Dr. Weickhmann is generally looked upon as a spy ; he is not a robust one. He told me that he had been living in places like East Africa and could not return to his home (Stuttgart) till it was really hot there. He asked whether there would be any objection to his travelling across southern Persia to Baluchistan, and said he understood that he would not be allowed into Afghanistan, etc. I warned him against attempting either journey. He has given out that he has come to study ethnology and that he takes particular interest in the uncivilized Bedouins ! Dr. Hesse, the German Consul, says that the man is a confirmed invalid and will assuredly die if he tries any difficult journey. VII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. I had for some time been expecting a Mr. Hope Johnstone. Several letters and newspapers had arrived for him, and I knew from Mr. Devey, His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus, that he was on his way here. He turned up one morning and came straight to the Residency, where he gave me a distinct shock. He was in a sort of Arab costume, very dirty, hair very long, bosom very manly and exposed and altogether very disreputable. It appears that he had come from Damascus with a caravan of donkeys and had walked almost the whole of the way. In return for a few Mejidies (paid before starting), he was supplied with food like an ordinary donkey driver and given a share of a donkey to either ride or use for the transport of his scanty baggage. When he left Damascus, he had about 2^ Mejidies (£0-4-8) in his pocket; he spent one-third of this sum on such luxuries as dates and local cigarettes, his companions robbed him of a like amount, and he had the equivalent of a shilling or two when he arrived here. Nevertheless he was looking wonderfully healthy and I found him an interesting man to talk to, but he had evidently travelled from Damascus to Baghdad via Hit, etc., in the same suit of clothes. I could not get out of him why he was travelling “ on the cheap ” ; it was not to win a bet, and he did not appear to be short of funds. Mr. Hope Johnstone, who, I was told, talks neither Turkish, Arabic or Persian, left a few days ago with a caravan for Kermanshah, and talked of subsequently going to Russian Turkistan via Hamadan and Tehran.

SUMMARY OF EVENTS IN TURKISH ’IRAQ DURING APRIL 1914. I.—Internal Affairs. (a) Baghdad WHay at. 1. Very little of importance occurred in this Wilayat during the month under report. The Waliand the Commander of the 13th Army Corps, who were not on •See last Summary-, 1.6. their differences. good terms*, met at a dinner given at the Military Club and are said to have made up 2. The post of Assistant Walit, left vacant since the departure of Lutfi Bey t See Summary (or September 1913,1.13. eight months ago, has been given to Khalil Hrjn Bey, who was formerly Mektoobji here. The Wali has also a “ Director of Political Affairs ” in the person of M. Phalere (a Greek, but an Ottoman subject) to assist him in the performance of his civil duties. 3. Sirri BeyJ, the Mutasarrif of Karbala, has gone home on leave and has given + out that, as he has friends at court, he will shortly receive a much higher appointment. His reputation is bad, and he is said to have taken home a lot of money and numerous valuable carpets. During my stay at Karbala I exchanged visits with the acting Mutasarrif (Irfan Bey) and found him a very intelligent and pleasant fellow. Though he had only been there two or three weeks, I found that he had gone into and knew all about the few official matters I had to discuss with him, While I ' was at Karbala, he raised £ T. 5,000 for a water supply for the town from the Husainiyah Canal, and he told me of his plans for improving the roads and sani tary condition of the place. I fear, however, that he is not to stop long as one ’Ali ’Ulwi Bey has been appointed Mutasarrif vice Sirri Bey. 4. Saiyid Muhammad Shariff Effendi, who is styled “ Inspector of the Baghdad Wilayat , arrived about the beginning of the month, He is said to have submitted a report to Constantinople recommending that the unoccupied lands be distributed among the nomadic tribes so that they may be induced to settle down, and he claims that in this way the safety of the roads and the country will be secured. 5. The Head Mudir of Posts and Telegraphs is anxious to establish a telephone system in the city and has called for the names of those willing to subscribe. 6. The Shi’ah community of Baghdad and K a dhimain have formed an Associa tion called the “ Shi’ah Union ” ; the object is to improve the “ religious, moral, mental, educational and financial condition” of the Shi’ahs. 7. The post of Manager of the Awqdf has been abolished, and that Department &gt; has been placed under the Qadhi of Baghdad, who is Prudent of the Canonical ^ / Court. A good many other pcjts have been abolished ; among them are those of the clerks of the Ndhiyahs or Mudirliks (sub-divisions), and the Mudirs have been told to do their own clerical work. Some of the Mudirs are said to be illiterate ! 8. On the military side, I have to report:— (a) the disbandment of the 31 st and 32nd Regiments of Cavalry and the transfer of the men—some 200 or 220 in number—to the Gendarmerie ; (b) the arrival of Brigadier ’Abdul Hamid Pasha to take over the post of Inspector of the Rediff (Reserves) from Colonel Ibrahim Bey, who is an Arab and a member of the Itildf party, is accused by the Committee of Union and Progress of disloyalty to the Government and has departed for Constantinople—probably to stand his trial before a court-martial; (c) the despatch from Baghdad about the middle of April of 100 infantry, 25 artillerymen and 4 machine guns for Basrah and the Muntafik country ; and C162FD India. Foreign No 2 4 .A, 11 SECREl' dated W14 ary s A2 (d) the issue of an order that soldiers are in their spare time to be given practical lessons in agriculture, the selection of a large plot of land for this purpose, and the formal opening thereof by the Wali. 9. At Najaf two sentries on duty at the Military Treasury broke into the latter place in the middle of the night and, having possessed themselves of some £ T. 300, decamped taking their rifles with them ! Efforts are being made to trace them. 10. Six young compounders arrived here early in April for service with the 13th Army Corps, having been sent out by the military authorities at Constantinople. On the day succeeding their arrival they were told that they were not wanted and might find their way back at their own expense. They of course had not the wherewithal, and the necessary funds were found by voluntary subscriptions, chiefly among military officers. This is not the first time that the proceedings of the Department over which Enver Pasha presides has been adversely criticised here. 11. The 27th April, the anniversary of the Sultan’s accession, was on this 0 . i ioiq t n occasion* observed as an official holiday. * See Summary for April 1913, 1. 11. TT • ^ „ .. ... • His Excellency the Wall held a full-dress reception at the Serai which, in my absence on tour at Najaf, Major Scott, I.M.S. attended in company with Captain Scott R.I.M., etc., etc. The Residency flag staff and the “ Comet ” were “ dressed ” during the day, and the Residency and the “ Comet ” were illuminated at night. The public buildings, etc., were also illumi nated after dark, not only here but at Najaf and Kufah, where I happened to be. The reception above mentioned was followed by a review (at which Major Scott, I.M.S., was present in plain clothes) and at which, I am told, a quarrel took place between some inhabitants of the Shaikh and Bani Sa’id quarters of Baghdad and two men of the former locality were killed. (b) Basrah Wilayat. 12. The British Consul at Basrah reports that the Wali (Sulaiman Shafiq Pasha), accompanied by Sami Bey (described as the Mutasarrif of Hasa), left Basrah in the “ Marmaris ” for Suqush Shuyuk and Nasiriyah to meet Amir Ibn t See last Summary, I. 23. Rashid'j* ; he was joined en route at Kurna i See last Summary, I. 22 . by Major Beha-ud-Din Beyt. With Ibn § See last Summary, I. 25. Rashid wag ’ A j aimi§ bin Sa’adun and at the interview which subsequently took place the followers of these two chiefs were paraded in the W ali s honour. The Wali is said to have received two horses from Ibn Rashid, and a horse, a mare and £ T. 500 from ’Ajaimi. The latter gave presents to various others such as the Mutasarrif of Muntafik, the Qaim-Maqam of Suqush Shuyuk, the Wall’s Aides-de-Camp, etc. ’Ajaimi asked the Wali to assist Muhammad-el-’Asaimi (the notorious enemy of Saiyid Talib) || whom he had || See last Summary, i. 20 and 22 . appointed as his sole representative at Basran and who has hitherto been residing at Zobeir in fear of his life. The Wali told him to send ’Asaimi into Basrah. Accordingly on the 28th April Hamad bin Sa adun (Ajaimrs brother) and u See Summarylfor July 1913 , 1. 1 ’Asaimi with some 400 [followers arrived in . . . . the neighbourhood of Zobeir and on the follow ing morning Hamid and Asaimi and a few followers drove into Basrah escorted by a guard of honour of gendarmes and proceeded to the house of Zoheir Pasha near the Ottoman Bank. The Wali went to Basrah at an early hour to meet them. Mr. Crow adds :—“ It is noticeable that the troops and artillery which have been encamped on the fringe of the desert for several weeks past, where they have been exercising and digging rifle-pits in the mounds which skirt Basrah for a distance of some 5 or 6 miles, were withdrawn to Basrah the day following the arrival of ’Ajaimi’s party here. It looks very much as if they had been placed there to meet any pos sible demonstration of the Arabs, and their martial appearance on the road as ‘ Ajaimi’s party entered the town may have been intended as a significant hint of the Wali’s preparations to greet any hostile movement on the part of the Muntafik Arabs on Basrah as was threatened last year. In any case the scare, if there was one, is over. The tents have been removed, the troops marched back to their barracks, and the cannon have all been packed up again in their sheds.” 13. I hear from Damascus that the motor-car** given by the Sultan to Ibn ** See last Summary, I. 23 Rash 1 id cached Median Salih some weeks . , ago, but it seems doubtful if it can be taken across the stony desert to Hail.* See last Summary, I. 15 and 23-24. f See paragraph 12 supra. | Probably the “ Amar Fauzi Bey ” of my last Summary, I. 23. 14. The British Consul at Basrah reports that a Commission has been appoint ed to effect a settlement of the El Hasa question with ’Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud* and left for Kuwait in the Shaikh of Kuwait’s launch on the 28th April. The Commission consists of Saiyid Talib Beyl Naqibzadah as President, and Major Beha-ud-Din Bey|, Major Omar Fauzi Bey! an d Sami Be 3 7 | as members. Accompanying them were (t) a Basrah lawyer (name illegible), (w) Muhammad-el-Na’ama, an Arab notable and landed proprietor, (Hi) ’Abdul Wahab Mandil, and (iv) ’Abdul Latif Mandil. The two last are also Arab notables and the agents at Basrah of Ibn Sa’ud. Mr. Crow understands that the instructions to the Commission are to settle the matter in a friendly way with Ibn Sa’ud at Kuwait. 15. Travelling in the same launch as the Commission were Berhan-ud-Din Bey (Public Prosecutor of the Basrah Appellate Court) and Hilmi Effendi (Direct or of Public Instruction), who were, on behalf of the Sultan, to present to the Shaikh of Kuwait the order of the Osmanieh (1st class) recently conferred on him by His Majesty. As the decoration had not arrived from Constantinople, one— presumably of the right pattern—was borrowed from Saiyid Talib ! The judicial authorities at Basrah were averse to letting the Public Prosecutor go on this mission as his services were required in the Court where much business awaited him, and the President of the Court of Appeal wrote to the Wali pointing out the inconvenience and delay that would be caused by his absence, but His Excellency looked at the matter from a different point of view and replied that it was “ only fair ” to give the Public Prosecutor a “ chance of making a little money” —an observation which appears to have caused some irritation in the Serai! 16. A private letter from Riyadh says that, Ibn Sa’ud having ordered the arrest at Qatif of one ’Abdul Husain, son of Juma’, whom he suspected to be a spy, the man was seized and brought to Riyadh. From the same source I hear of the arrival of 14 camel loads of presents for Ibn Sa’ud from the Shariff of Makkah. Ibn Sa’ud immediately sent the Shariff a large quantity of presents in return, placing a member of his family called Nasir in charge of them. 17. Fighting is reported from’ Ali-al-Gharbi between the tribes of Shaikh Jawad and Shaikh Jandal, and 12 men are said to have been killed and 25 wounded. The above was probably in continuation of the affray metioned by me in my last Sum- mary§ The country round about there § See last Summary, IV. 1. an( j ‘Amarah seems to have been very unsafe lately.Mr. Crow tells me that he heard that the Captain of the “ Musal ” and two persons on board that steamer were kpied by Arabs, but the rumour has not been confirmed here. The Captain of the Euphrates and Tigris Company’s boat “ Mejidieh ” asked the Wilayat for a guard for the journey of that boat up the river in the middle of April, but the acting Wali, after a telegraphic reference to ’Amarah, replied that a guard was not considered necessary. 18 19 18. Fighting in the Muntafik country continued]! during April. The two j| See last Summary, i. 19 . principal chiefs engaged are Khayyun^J 1 See Summary for September 1913, 1. 7. and Suwaylim, and the following is a list of the tribes who have supported the one or the other, viz. : — On Khayyun’s side. —A1 ’Abudah, A1 Shamkhi, ’Atab, Bani Richab (near Hai), Khafaja, Sanajir and Umayrat.

The Mutasarrif of Muntafik is said to have taken the side of Suwaylim—it is not stated in what way—and Khayyun has^had the worsted it, though there has been a good deal of loss of life on both sides. 19. I understand that the Police of Basrah town have been reorganised and the following new posts created, viz., 3 “ Sar Commissaires ’, 5 “ Commissaires ”, 13 “ Assistant Commissaires ” and 71 men.20. Of various rumours, I will mention two for what they may be worth, viz., (a) that the Wali of Basrah will shortly resign and be succeeded by Major Beha- ^ 0 j n ud-Din* Bey, and (b) that Shaikh Khazal * See paragraphs 12 and 14 supra. t -\r -i • i &lt;&lt; • r 6 of Mohammerah has received an impor tant decoration ” from the^French Government! (c) Mused W Hay at. 21. The most important event of the month has been the fighting between the Turkish troops and the Shaikh of Baraizanf (or Barzan as the place seems to be . 0 , . „ to, generally called). A reference to recent summaries will show that this was not un expected ; indeed it has been evident that the Wali, ever since he assumed charge in November last, had determined to come to blows with this Kurdish chieftain. The official account, which has appeared in several newspapers, announced a complete victory for the Government with the loss of two soldiers killed and eight slightly wounded, the route of the Kurds—eight chiefs and a large number of men killed— the headlong flight of the Shaikh with the remnants of his followers, and the occupation of the village of Barzan and its creation as the headquarters of a Nahiyah (or sub-division) of the Wilayat. This account is incomplete and some what misleading. The Wali set out for 'Aqrah, accompained by the chiefs of the Harkiyaht and Surahiyah tribes, and, on reaching the river Zab, attempted to X See Summary for November 1913 to Jan- get across in rafts before properly silenc- uary 1914, 1. 25. j n g the enemy on the opposite bank. In the early part of this operation he is said to have lost a good many men (killed and wounded) and his leading raft was sunk by the Kurds. This made him more cautious ; the other rafts got safely across, and there seems to be little doubt that the casualties among the Shaikh’s men were subsequently heavy. The official account is correct in saying that the Shaikh fled with some of his followers and that the Government troops occupied his village of Barzan. The Shaikh retired § See (Summary for December 1909 and- first to a hill called Shirin Taghi§ (the scene of January 1910, 1, i. a former exploit of his) and is now reported to be at Urumiyah, where he is said to have received a welcome from the Russians. The official account, however, fails to mention an incident which happened at about the same time as the passage of the Zab. Reinforcements were, as previously arranged, on their way from Rowanduz to join the W ali and had to pass the night at a village called Merkasar ; they failed to take the usual precautionary measures, and the Kurds fell upon them and handled them severely. I understand that two Turkish officers were killed and three wounded, and that the rank and file suffered heavily. This contretemps was not noticed by the Wali in his proclamation, but As’ad Pasha made it known. The latter and the Wali are, as I have already|| l|See Summary for November 1913 to January reported, Oil bad terms, and As ad Pasha S 1914 ,1. 20 . hostility was increased by the Wall, when starting out on this expedition, putting in the Mektoobji, a young and inexperienced officer, to act for him at head-quarters. The Wali, on his return to Musal (about April 24th), gave out that he was well aware of the part played by As ad Pasha in this business. He claims to have evidence that the Commander of the 12th Army Corps was not only in correspondence with the Shaikh, but actually helped him in opposing the Government and escaping across the frontier into Persia, and it % is believed that he has sent a full report to Constantinople and asked for permission to convene a court-martial for the trial of As ad Pasha. 22 In addition to the trouble mentioned above, certain other tribes are said to be out ”, viz., the Hamawand under Muhammad Khidhr and Tawfiq Bey (formerly Majors of Gendarmerie), the Jaf and the Duzdi (near Shamamik). They are demanding efficient reforms and giving out that, if they are^orthcoming, they will invite the Russians to come across and introduce them. W hat with the friction between the Wali and the Commander of the 12th Army Corps, the fact that the military officers—many of whom are Kurds, incensed at the loss of their clans men—are generally on the side of As’ad Pasha, and the breaking out of the Hama wand etc. the situation seems to be serious. The Russians are believed not to have acted the part of passive spectators, and certain military officers here seem for November 1 913 to to think that SafwatU Bey has been instigate ^ See Summary January 1914,1. 20. ing the tribes to defy the Government,5 1 1 e t a e 3 y e a f a i 8 t ,1 i I f i t y t 'y i 9 II S a 1 t 3 T a 3 1 1 n t o a 23 Mr Hony, the late Vice-Consul at Musal who knew the Shaikh of Baraizan rtolW and hid heard of this fighting, wrote to me on the 18th April on quite Musal) S,S.S .rE^f •See Summary for Otober 1911,1.9.

In my last Summary I mentionedt that the Wall and the Germans had come to an agreement m writing that, it it tSee last Summary I, 26. was decided to give the town of Musa! a water supply, the work should be entrusted to the Baghdad Railway Company. The “ A 7 ear East ” of the 10th April—a copy of which arrived by last mail—had an article headed “ Musal Reforms ”, and for facility of reference I give below an extract therefrom relating to the proposed water supply “We have been informed from a private and authoritative source that an hen the new Wali, Sulaiman Nazif Bey, was on the look out for a compe tent engineer to study the plans and estimates, it so happened, qui e casually, thatM. Auble, ‘chef de section’ and engmeer of the Berman Baghdad Railway Company, should be travelling to Musal. M. Auble was willing to undertake the task proposed to him by the Wall, but as it would require a month’s work he wr ote to Meissner Pasha tor permission. Not only was it granted, but Meissner Pasha is said to have gone so far as to offer to place funds and technical advisers a le Wall’s disposal to hasten the work. “ Survey and estimate work have begun. The following is a rough outline of a provisional agreement drawn up between the Baghdad Railway Company, on the one hand, and the authorities of the Wilayat ot Musal on the other :— “ 1. The concession is to last forty years. “ 2 . The capital is to be 2,250,000 francs, of which 2,000,000 francs are to be employed in the purchase of material and in construction woiks. “ 3 . Provisional supply, 2,000 cubic metres per diem, of which 1,500 cubic metres to be taxed. Maximum supply, 5,000 cubic metres per diem. “ 4 . In the case of competitive offers the right of priority—conditions being otherwise similar—is reserved for the Baghdad Railway Company ; if more favourable conditions are offered the Ottoman Minister of Public Works is to decide between the Baghdad Railway Company and the competing firms. “ 5. The designs and estimates have to be submitted within three months (he., the agreement was signed in February). f‘ 6 If the Baghdad Railway Company does not i\M the above condi- tions the agreement is declared null and vo&amp;, and the company loses its right of priority, having at the same time to cover its own initial expenses! ” 26.

He stopped for a short time at Musal and called C162FD6 (among others the French Consul or Vice-Consul) there. The latter talked to him about a variety of local subjects, including this one of a water supply for the town, and Mr. Bullard very kindly took down notes for my information. The purport of these notes was very similar to the account which is to be found in the “ Near East ”, but they contained the following variations and additions, the capital to be raised was, he understood, 2,300,000 (and not 2| million) francs, and he was told that there was excellent authority for stating that the odd fanes (250,000 or 300,000) were to go to the Wali! The Railway Company at first asked for a con cession for irrigation also, but the Wall said that he had no power to grant it. There was, however, reason to believe that the scheme for the water supply was to include water for irrigation purposes because the plant to be erected was much more than a mere water supply project for the town would require. The pro posed plant included (a) six Dixel motors of 100 H. P. each—price francs 270,000 ; (6) 50,000 metres of steel pipes—price francs 50,000 ; and (c) two filter-beds at francs 200,000 each. The charge for water was, he was told, to be 3 piastres (or 6 d.) per cubic metre, which he considered a “ crushing tax in a town as poor as Musal ”. 27. The above is the information which Mr. Bullard received from the French Consular Officer before he saw the “ Near East ” of the 10th April and before the French Consular Officer could have seen that paper. Further the gentleman last mentioned got his intelligence from a countryman of his, whom he invited to a quiet dinner with this end in view, who is in the service of the Baghdad Railway Company and who did not disappoint his host, but became loquacious after dessert. Having regard to the above and unless we decline to accept the theory of “ In vino veritas”, I think that we may accept the French Consul’s account as a more or less accurate exposition of the state of affairs qua this “ water supply ” scheme. It is true that the Baghdad Railway Company will later on want water for their own requirements, but even so the capital mentioned in the “ provisional agreement ” (2’25 or 2-3 million francs) seems excessive when it is remembered that the river Tigris flows immediately past and practically on a level with a town which is not densely populated. How are the Concessionaires after paying working expenses, to secure a reasonable rate of interest on a capital of, say, £90,000 ? What real demand for pipe water will there be at the impossible rate of 6d per cubic metre ? Are the people who have hitherto washed themselves, their clothes and vegetables in the river and who have obtained their drinking and cooking water from the same source to be compelled to get future supplies for all purposes from the pipe system ? These, it seems to me, are matters which do not concern us. If, as is probably the case, there is some secrit understanding between the Wali and the Railway Com pany and it relates to some irrig^on project, I do not think we need take alarm because I understand that the northernmost project on Sir William Willcocks , irrigation programme—so far as the Tigris is concerned—is nearer Samarrah than Musal. 28. Another thing that the French Consul told Mr. Bullard was that the Wali had informed him that his Government considered that the Germans were getting things too much into their own hands and that they (the Government) would like to see firms of other nationalities sending in estimates and designs for the water supply scheme. The French Consular Officer addressed his Embassy and received a reply that no French firm was interested in the matter. The Wali made no such communication to our Dragoman. II. —British Interests and Cases. 1. I was at the Hindiyah Barrage on the 20th April and again on May 1st. The “ additional* work ” on which the * See last Summary, II. 1. engineers were engaged consisted of an escape to carry off flood water and was taken up merely as a precautionary measure. The floods came down before they were expected and before work had been com pleted, and a certain amount of damage was done, though not of course to the Barrage. Gangs wer? set to work night and day, and everything had been put right by the time of my sec/ond visit. 2. Mr. Warbrick of the firm of Sir John Jackson, Ltd., and Messrs. Whitelaw and Apted of Messrs. S. Pearson and Son have gone home. III. —British Indian Interests. Nil.IV.—British Official Matters. 1. I was on a tour from the 20th April to the 2nd May visiting Musaiyib, the Hindiyah Barrage, Karbala, Najaf, Kufah, Tajiyah and Babylon. At Karbala and Najaf I attended some of the meetings of the Oudh Bequest Committee at which money was distributed to deserving persons. The accounts are not yet out, and I will notice them in my next Summary. At Karbala I visited the hostel of the Borahs (run on excellent lines) and the “ Indian” school (attended mostly by Persian boys). At the halfway place between Karbala and Najaf I met the Shaikh of Bani Hasan ; he told our Vice-Consul (who was travelling with me) that if he was seen talking to me for any length of time he would get into trouble ! 2. Messrs. Wratislaw and Hubbard of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission arrived here on the 17th April and stayed at the Residency. Captain Pierpoint, I. M. S., the Medical Officer, arrived about a week later. The latter and Mr. Wratis law left for Qasr-i-Shirin on the 5th May, and Mr. Hubbard a day earlier. Mr. Wr at is law’s health had improved by the rest and change of air and scene, but he was still inclined to be despondent about himself. 3. Several of the foreigners on the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, e,g., Mr. Minorsky (Russian Commissioner) and Mirza ’Abdul Razzaq Khan (Persian Chief Engineer) have, for some reason or other, been having their letters, parcels and even telegrams addressed to my care, although Baghdad possesses a Russian and Persian Consul-General. 4. The usual statement showing work done at the Residency Dispensary during the period under report is attached (Annex^ure A). V.—Persian Affairs. 1. His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah reports that the collection of fees on the Baghdad-Kermanshah road (Persian section) has been systematically recom menced. The Kalhur country is also disturbed by quarrels between two chiefs, and the Governor-General has despatched some 200 sowars to Mahidasht to support one of the chiefs. The presence of the sowars is not likely to affect the safety of the road, but it is generally believed that, if the Farman-Farma were to go himself to Kirind or Harunabad, the tribes would at once become obedient. At $gsent they believe that his continual threats to come have been only bluff and that they can do as they like. The Farman-Farma says that he will go if he is given the necessary expenses and two maxim guns. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has made strong represen tations to the Persian Government, and Mr. McDouall tells me that he has “ reason to hope that Farman-Farma will go shortly to the districts and that the road will then become safe again ”. VI.—Foreign Interests other than British or Persian. 1. Young Mr. Xanthopoulo* has^ft Baghdad for Europe with his father and * „ , , 0 , rT „ mother, and his connection with the Bagh- See last Summary, VI dad Railway has ceased. With the pay- ment of £ T. 200 to the family of the Arab who was killed at Samarrah, that incident may be considered as closed. 2. Mr. A. Farkhaty, styling himself Russian Vice-Consul at Najaf, called on tne the other day, but I was out. He must be taking the place of an unpaid Consular Agent whom I met at Najaf during my recent visit to that place, and who told me that he had no work to do. 3. Mr. Popoff,t acting Russian Consul-General here, has left for Europe via tSee Summary for November 1913 to Basrah, and has been succeeded by Baron January 1914, Vi. i. A.

The situation at Samawahj- appears to have improved, and I hear that t See last Summary 13 * the troops there are to be recalled. There but nothing has yet been decided. is some talk of sending them to Basrah, 5. The Wali has written to the authorities at Constantinople recommending the establishment of an Agricultural School at Baghdad. He has also called for ___ tenders for the construction of two bridgest + J (suspension and pontoon) over the Tigris here. The notice appeared in the official organ of the Wilayat—‘ £ Zaurah ’ ’— and I have mentioned the matter to the representatives of certain British firms here. I am getting a translation of the conditions, etc., and will send a copy to the Government of India and the Embassy. Tenders were first called for by some date in August, but this part of the notice has since been cancelled. It is doubtful if anything will come out of it. 6. Brigadier Hasam-ud-din Pasha, the new Commandant of the 13th Army Corps, arrived at Baghdad on the 15th February accompanied by Major ’Isfan Bey, the new Commandant of the Gendarmerie of this Wilayat. The former and the Wali are said not to be on good terms. 7. The local branch of the Committee of Union and Progress gave a soiree at the Hotel of Osman Agha in the Maidan quarter of Baghdad at which . „ , „ T „ subscriptions were invited for the Turkish 5 See last Summary, flee( . § A sum of £ T 130 was co H ected . The total amount subscribed to the above fund by the inhabitants of Baghdad to the end of February was only £ T. 530. I hear of £ T. 1,200 having been raised at Salahiyah as the result—so the “ Zuhur ” newspaper of the 14th February says—of an oration by a school-boy and of another £ T. 70 or so at Balad, but there is no real enthusiasm for this object here. Among other recent moves of the local branch of the Committee of Union and Progress are :—(a) the opening in their school here of a club or debating society called “ Idman” (or “En deavour ’’), the idea being to train the young members as future “ Itihadis ” (or Unionists) ; and (6) the promulgation of an order said to have come from the Central Office advising the Muhammadans to buy nothing from non-Muham madan merchants and shopkeepers. This boycott, it is expi/^ned, was originally directed against the Greeks, but was subsequently extended. The Baghdadis pay little heed to such advice and the local Committee expect no success here. 8. The list of those entitled to vote for the election|| of deputies to represent n c i to t k Baghdad city in the Turkish Chamber p as ummary, . . wag i n middle of February, and the result of the voting was announced towards the end of March thus :— 1 Jamil Sidqi (a Kurd). Shavket Pasha (a Turk). Sassoon Effendi (a Jew). Khalid Bey (a Turk). Taufik Bey (a Turk). &gt; All the above are ‘ £ Union and Progress ’ ’ men. The deputies for Karbala are :— ’Abdul Mehdi Bey ; and Nuri Bey ; while those for Shamiyah are :— Shaikh Mubdin-el-Firaun; and Fu’ad Efiendi Jabazizadah. S9. In the beginning of March the Head Mudir of Posts and Telegraphs was ordered by cypher telegram from Constantj^j/ple to decline to receive communica tions addressed to Qirq Kilisa (near Adrianople). This caused some excitement among the high officials who became aware of the order. The suggested solution of the mystery is that some disaffected ^military officers had about that time been deported to Qirq Kilisa ! 10. According to a private letter fiom Baghadah (on the right bank of the Tigiis above Kut), there has been severe fighting between the tribes residing at Shadi and Samay in the course of which 20 were killed and about 100 wounded. The cause is said to have been a tract of land claimed by both sides. 11. A Frenchman has offered to convey the post betw een Baghdad and Aleppo in motor-cars, but negotiations still continue. It is recognised that such a service is out of the question until the road is improved, and 1 am assured that the Minister of Public Work has ordered the necessary repairs to be done and that the road has been divided into three sections, viz., Aleppo-Bayr, Dayr-’Anah and ’Anah-Baghdad, each under a special engineer. The engineers are ^d to have arrived, and the name of the officer posted to the ’Anah-Baghdad section is Rashid Bey. From all sources—including our Postmaster—I hear of the increasing popularity* of the Baghdad-Aleppo-Constantinople postal * See last Summary, I. 8. .service 12. The cost of internal telegramj(has recently been reduced. The present rates are:— (a) Within the same town or city— 2| Piastres (or 5d.) for a telegram containing 20 words or less ; 1J Piastres (or 2bd.) for each additional 10 words. (b) To other places in the Turkish Empire— 5 Piastres (or lOd.) for a telegram containing 10 words or less. ^ Piastre (or 1&lt;2.) for each additional word. 13. The house of a muleteer here was suddenly searched the other day by the military authorities and 8 Mauser rifles with some 500 cartridges were found. These are said to have been stolen from the military depot here, and the store-keeper and others are under arrest and await trial. 14. I give below a list of the troops in this Wilayat on the 25th March last:— Artillery — 14 field guns Men. 154 8 mountain guns .. 101 4 quick-firing guns .. 66 2 “ Mitrailleuses ” .. 35 Fort gunners (Istikhan) 43 Transport .. •• 86 Infantry — Infantry (including Mishanji) .. - • 603 Telegraph Company .. .» .. 44 Non-commissioned officers’ school (Khochik Zdbit) .. 60 Recruits • • « • ... 480 Cavalry — 112 horses • • • .. 158 Miscellaneous — Military factory • • * * • 245 Grand total:— : 28 guns ; 112 horses ; and 2,075 men.4 (5) Basrah Wilayaf- 15. The new Wali of Basrah (Sulaiman Shafiq Pasha*) left Constantinople * See last Semmary, I. 16. ° n ^ BaSral ^ on the 3rd March. He travelled m the: Russian steamer Saratow ’ as far as Fao and thence came up in the “Marmaris The new Mutassariiof 'Amarah (Salami Bey) travelled with him. The w Saratow ’’ brought 796 men (including 18 officers and a clerk) of the 1st Battalion of the 26th Regiment and 500 cases of ammuntion. Mr. Crow writes that orders- were sent from Constantinople in February last to despatch a military force to t See last Sumaiary, i. u. ^ Hassa against Ibn Sa ud ~f r but that T i J* XI the necessary arrangements had been de- jayed pending the arrival of the new Wali. Though His Excellency has now been n Basrah more than a month, no force has yet been despatched. 16. Mr. Crow has sent rne “ for the information of the Government of India 0 a copy of a despatch which he addressed to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador a ons an mople on Maich 31st, and I am separately submitting a copy of this document to the Government of India. It deals with the new Waifs desire to carrv out certain municipal improvements at Basrah such as the electric lighting of the town, the starting of an electric tramway, the construction of a road from Ashar to Basrah, etc. His Excefleney seems to think that a capital of £ 200,000 will be required for what he wants ; he is hopeful of raising one-haff of this sum local. &gt; \ a ? d M W0 ^ &lt;1 056 B !l ? nancl . er . s t0 hel P h m with the rest. In this same des- P ion« &lt; :i roW -' lent ':l 1 ^ h e activities of the Germans since their arrival at Basrah in 190b and writes: There is no doubt that the Germans will help the Turks m the present instance if we fail to do so.” Basrah has acquired an unenviable ’m i Kh !T at first S1 '^ ht is not attractive, but it must not be overlooked that the place and harbour are likely to become more important in the course ot a few years„ r xH?^ ^’ s ^ ia £ act i n g Wall of Basrah, has been placed on the re tired list, though quite a young man, and was in Baghdad a few days ago. 18. Nadir Bey, Mutassarif of Nasiriyah, was fired at by an unknown Arab and wounded. He was brought here for treatment. r ’^ ow i ards tlie ^dle of March news was received of fighting at Shatrat- al-Muntafiq between the Ab-al-Jahl and the Abu-Najm tribes. Eighty men are said to have been killed. The British Consul reports that the Muntaficj country generally is m a very disturbed condition. 20. At the end of January Saiyid Talib BeyJ issued a printed manifesto te&gt; X See last Summary, i. ii-is ^ \ n ^ a bi ta nts of Basrah and its depen- . , xfo x T n dencies m which he stated that all differ ences between the Central Government and himself were at an end, that all mis understandings had been removed and that he would in future work with the Government for the happiness of Turkey and do all he could to promote the Otto man unity ! There is no reason to take this seriously. According to news from Basrah the Sultan has conferred the highest class of the order of the Osmanieh oa baiyid Talib and a gold medal of sorts on each of his sons§ who are studying at a § See last Summary, i, 15 . French College in Constantinople. The « t x,^ vn a T fo,- newspaper “ Dha’at-it-Tasa ” (“ The cui&gt; £ 0 71 T ) r i P ubll , shed ’ }. !i? le t ve ; at Basrah-has an article vehemently attacking .,mul lahb for his anti-Turkish feelings. The writer declares that the Govern? ment t are well aware of the misdeeds and intrigues of the wily Naqibzadah, who will soon be ruined and pei^ijh.” ^ 21 21. The sum subscribed at Basrah towards the Turkish Fleetff fund amounted |1 See last Summary, I, 15. by the end of January to £ T. 5,000. Collec- , • r « m m tions continue, and I have heard of a dona tion of £ T. 800—some say £ T. 300 only—from the Shaikh of Mohammerah, who ia(74 'M 5 supposed to have received in return the Osmanieh of the first class. As for the.... * a i * Ci-i™ ty-i aT-.r t ft “ Aviation ”* fund, the inhabitants of * See last Summary, I. b. -r&gt; i -i . i i -i. j isasrah are said to have subscribed £ T. 500, and money is still being collected. 22. Major Beha-ud-din Bey, Chief of the Safi, 13th Army Corps, visited Basrah in February on some confidential business ; he was accompanied by the Wali’a Aide-de-Camp, Lieutenant Ibrahim Bey. I asked Mr. Crow to keep an eye on them. It would seem that the visit to Basrah was in connection with some or all of the following matters, viz., (a) to arrange for the troops expected byjthe “ Saratow ” (paragraph 15 supra ); (6) to re-assure Saiyid Talib as to the attitude of the authoritea towards him; (c) to make a military inspection and institute private enquiries about the general feeling in the place ; and {d) to prepare a list of officers (quartered in Basrah) who were to be dismissed or pensioned off. As regards {d) supra several officers (supposed to be friends of Saiyid Talib) have recently been transferred here from Basrah ; two have been sent to Yemen ; and others have been dismissed ot placed on the pension list. 23. The local paper “ Arriyadh ” states that Amir Ibn Rashidf has received . „ . , 0 y I, from the Turkish Government 20,000 ee as , ummary, . Mauser rifles and a few mountain and other guns. This was early in February. A private letter from Constantinople to a man here received at the end of March announced that a deputation consisting of Major Amar Fauzi Bey, Major ’Aoni Bey and Lieutenant Sadiq Effendi is being sent to the Amir to discusss with him matters relative to Traq and N^jd, and that the Govern- ment are giving Ibn Rashid some more rifles (of the latest pattern) and a motor-car. Perhaps the Turkish Government hope that Ibn Rashid will join them in an expedi- „ , , p tion to El Hassat and use these arms against ; See paragraph 15 Ibn Sa &gt; ud j My information, however, is that the two Amirs are at present on good terms. 24. I understand that a letter was received from Riyadh about a month ago in which it was stated that all the important Shaikhs of the tribes in and near Ityjd broke their swords before Ibn Sa’ud in the presence of thousands of tribesmen, i. e., that all these Shaikhs promised allegiance to him and that the particular form of promise adopted is deemed sacred and binding. If such be the case, Ibn Sa‘ud would appear to have a good deal of backing. My latest news about him \ (received March 26th) is that he suddenly left Riyadh for an unknown destination, and appointed one Abdullah to act for him as Amir of El Hassa. 25. Shaikh ’Ajaimi§ of the Muntafiq has recently been in trouble. He was o T .. worsted by the Adh-dhifr tribe, fled to § See last * ummary, . Jabal Sanam and has now sought the pro tection of the Shaikh of Kuwait. (c) Musal W Hay at. 26. According to the reports of the Dragoman in charge of our Vice-Consulate T „ at Musal, the Wali (Sulaiman Nazif Beyll) II See last Summary, I. 20. ^ ^ ^ hig mind to ^ a across the river there, a good road through the middle of the town and a proper water-supply. To assist him in this direction he sought the aid of the Ger mans and Meissner Pasha sent up one of his engineers called Obley (or some such name) on the condition that the works, if decided on, would be given to the Baghdad Railway Company. An agreement to this effect as regards the water- supply project appears to have been signed by both parties on the 16th February. Subsequently Mr. Obley prepared plans for the water-supply and the bridge and, on their being approved by the Wilayat, submitted them to Meissner Pasha for orders. The Dragoman goes on to say that His Excellency makes things very e-tsv for the German Vice-Consluate while in the affairs of other foreign nations he will not go “ beyond a promise ”. I admit that my informant is only a Dragoman and an Orient/al and—possibly not a very capable man—but his letters since I name here last November do not fail to indicate that the Germans are going ahead C98FD6 I in that part ot ’ Iiaq and that we are losing ground. I therefore venture to express , c c r rw u inio T o the hope* that it may be found possible to J _ send very shortly a young and active Vice- Consul to represent our interests at Musal. 27. The Wali is busy organising a campaign against the Shaikh of Baraizan,f f See last Summary, I L 23-25. an d has called in several other Shaikhs in ordelf to secure their co-operation. He seems to have sent 300 Infantry and two mountain guns to Aorah and a somewhat laiger force to Amadiyah, and it is stated that he will himself shortly proceed to 'Aqrah to arrest the Shaikh ('Abdus Salam). 28. Other reports from the Dragoman mention (a) the establishment of a postal service between Musal and 'Amadiyah, and of a telegraph line between Musal and 'Aqrah ; (b) the opening of a Gendarmerie school, as at Baghdad; (c) the arrival of Saiyid Pasha from Damascus to replace General Fatteh Pasha (transferred to the pension list) as Commandant of the Reserves ; (d) the activity of the Wali in indirectly forcing the people to elect as deputies those who belong to the Committee of Union and Progress ; (e) the arrival of the 34th Cavalry Regiment (250 men and 190 horses) from Kirkuk for an object not stated ; (/) the fall in the monthly salary of a private infantry from one Mejidieh (3s. 4d.) to a quarter of this sum ; and (g) the continued insecure condition of the district generally. II.—British Interests and Cases. 1. The minor works whxh remained to be done in connection with the Hindiah Barrage!: have been completed; two or three } See last Summary, ii. 1-5. 0 f the Engineers of Sir John Jackson, Limited, are still out at Hindiyah doing some additional work at the request of the Government, and the others have gone or are about to go home. Mr. Whit/ley spends his time between Hindiyah and Baghdad, the clerical and accounts establishment being at the latter place. Three officers of the firm of Messrs. S. Pearson and Son, Limited, viz., Messrs. Whitelaw, Moore and Apted (formerly engaged on the Mohammerah-Khorremabad railway survey) are also here; they have recently visited Fallujah, Hit, etc., in connection with the irrigation projects there. Mr. Whitelaw does not expect that the Turkish Government will decide under another two months what future irrigation works are to be carried out in Mesopotamia and by whom and on what conditions, so he and Mr. Apted propose going home very shorty to confer with Messrs. S. Pearson and Son, leaving Mr. Moore out here to furnish any further information that may be required. I understand that the work being done at § See last Summary, II. 7.] the Habbaniyah Escape§ consits only little excavation. 2. I am glad to be able to report that Mr. Wilson, the local Manager of Messrs. Strick Scott and Co., has at last obtained permission to erect tanks|| at Garara || See last Summary, II. 8. f ° r tb , e “ tora b' e °f oil in bulk, though I am afraid that this was not arranged without the passing of money into the capacious and by no means empty pockets of the burly President of the Baghdad Municipality Mr. Wilson has started building a boundary wall round his land, but more serious operations are postponed till the arrival of Mr. W*right, an Engineer, who is acting at Chia Surkh fot Mr. tii. B. Soane. The latter is now on his way out and (Inshallah) the gazlhana at Garara should be ready by the end of the year. 3. The matter of the proposed Ottoman Navigation Company has been attract ing a certain amount of local attention. It was announced in the latter half of February that the authorities had been ordered to estimate the value of all the7 (&amp;) ^ JU property of the Nahrieh Company at Baghdad and Basrah, and that the value of the property at the latter place has been estimated at £T. 10,000, and a rumour went round to the effect that the Nahrieh steamers were, from the 14th March 1014, to be made o\er to a new Ottoman (or Anonymous) Company, the capital of which was to be one-half British and the other half Ottoman and German in equal shares. Scon after, Mr. llTills (a senior officer of Gra} Mackenzie of Basrah), and an Engineer of the British India Steam Navigation Company, arrived here and, in conjunction with Mr. Tod (Manager of the Agents of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company) and certain representatives of the local authorities, proceeded to value the fleet, etc., of the Nahrieh. Their labours have, I understand, just been concluded and, though there has of course been no unanimity, there is ample material for an amicable settlement. The Baghdad Chamber, of Commerce submitted a protest to the Wali against the transfer of Turkish steamers to a British firm and represented that the wealthy Muham madans of the city were prepared to put down the necessary funds provided that the concession was given only to Turkish subjects. His Excellency passed on the protest to Constantinople, but the signatories thereto, anticipate no success. 4. The local papers have not kept silent on the subject, and the “ El Mishah ” (or “ the candle ,: ) of the 13th March contained an illuminating article. It began by warning its readers that what Great Britain had done in India she intended to do in Turkish ’Iraq and advised them to “ arm themselves with the necessary ^ weapons to fight the pioneers of the colonising army in this country l” In olden times Great Britain made up her mind to annex India; she sent out merchants who formed a small trading company at Madras at a time when practi cally the whole of the trade of the East was in the hands of a French Com pany. A keen competition arose between these two companies, and there ensued a war which ended in the defeat of the French and their expulsion from India. Subsequently the British encouraged the various rulers of India to fight among themselves and provided them with the implements of war and in the end many independent States were annihilated and Britain subdued thej whole of Hindustan with its 300 million inhabitants, including 50 million Muhammadans ! The paper, in the belief that the navigation concession had been given to the Lynch Company, likens the latter to the old East India Company ! The Lynch Company began in a small way and, in return for assistance rendered by Great Britain 'to Turkey in the Crimean War, were allowed to run a small steamer on the Euphrates. Subsequently two large fast-running steamers took the place of the above boat and both flew the “ cherished Turkish flag,” but after a short time the British flag was substituted. Subsequently the Company misled * ‘ our statesmen ’ ’ and added two more steamers to their fleet. Not con tent with this, they cast their eyes on the Idareh Nahrieh and, but for the powerful opposition of Germany, would have secured the sole monopoly of navigation on all the rivers of Turkish ’Iraq. The Lynch Company are not only concerned with navigation but do an extensive business in trade with agencies at Basrah, Musal, Khanaqin and most of the larger towns in these parts, and “ we do not exaggerate when we say that they hold the reins of trade i n their iron hands and that the native merchants are nothing but subordinates and brokers without influence ! ” The British Government, the paper goes on to say, covet Kuwait, Nejd, Katr, Oman and Bahrain and veiledly support tbe Lynch’ Company, who will be the “ Harbingers of a vast colony here.” To give the navigation into foreign hands is ‘ ‘ like taking the soul out of the body ” ! The Lvnch Company will look after themselves and those who further their interests, and will probably decline to carry Turkish troops when required to suppress ’disturbances in the Muntafiq country, Amarah, etc. The arrangement is a throughly bad one ; it will throw ‘ ‘ hundreds of our compatriots out of work, will put the foreigner in touch with the rural population and thus enable them to sow the seeds of discord between the Ottoman Government and Turkish subjects ”, The writer (Ibrahim Hilmi) concludes by saying that, if in the above comments he has expressed himself strongly, he has done so “ out of respect for and consi- Aaratinn to our Government and in order to warn them against the seditions and intrigues to which the country is now submitted ”. The 15 th March and “ Arriyadh ” (or rose-garden ) of the 19th idem have beenpilgrims and, as he and his father were great friends of my father, when Com missioner at Lucknow, we had much to talk about. 2. A troublesome case which has been going on for more than five years has recently been settled. It was reported to the Government of India and His Bri tannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Cons- * No. 182 to the Government of India and tantinople in the late Mr. Lorimer’s mar- Mari mi. 10 J: ginally-noted* despatches. I need not re- peat what he wrote and merely report that the purchase money (£ T.158)has been repaid to Saiyid Jawwad (the agent of the Faizi-i-Husaini) who has, I understood, transferred it to the Association just mentioned. IV_British Official Matters. 1. During the period under report I made the usual trip to Basrah, etc., in the R.I.M.S. “ Comet ”, leaving Baghdad on the 23rd February and arriving back again on the 16th March. Besides spending two or three days at Basrah— where, on arrival, the river was rough, the “ Comet ” rolled and some of my party suffered from mol de meT —I visited Mohammerah (where, in company with Major Haworth, I called on the Shaikh and happened to meet the Shaikh of Kuwait) and spent an instructive morning at Abadan. On my way down to Basrah we anchored for the night at Shaikh Saiyid and learned that a fight ha#L just taken place between the Arabs of that part and those of Ali-al-Gharbi, in which the former claimed to have been victorious. The men whom we saw were busy loading cartridges in anticipation of a further row ; their rifles appeared to have come from Maskat, and they complained that the price of each such weapon had ^ gone up from 2 or 3 to 6 or 7 liras. Shortly after, the Mut^sariff of Amarah %~ passed us in a small gun-boat to enquire into the previous day s disturbance. 2. I am leaving in two or three days’ time for Karbala and Najaf to attend the distribution of the Oudh Bequest money at those places and make the acquaintance of the principal people there. I hope ^ to put in a few hours at Ballon on my way back. It will be hot by the time I return here and is sufficiently warm even now. 3. The Turco-Persian Frontier Commission are now at Mendali, and I am send ing mail-bags and telegrams there. I have just this moment heard that Mr. Wra- tislaw (who is not very well) and Mr. Hubbard are coming here in a few days for rest, etc. It is very unfortunate that Mrs. Erskine and I will be away, but the Residency will be at their disposal, and we will arrange for their comfort. The telegram which contained the news of Mr. Wratislaw’s approaching visit directs that Captain Dyer (who is attached to the Commission temporarily and who has been spending the last few days with me here) is to take the next lot of mail- bags to Qasr-i-Shirin and not to Mendali as previously arranged. The statement attached (Annexure A) shows the work done at the Residency Dispensary during February and March. (Major Scott, I.M.S., was absent on casual leave during the last ten days of March). The preponderance of female patients is noticeable. V.—Persian Affairs. 1. The Dragoman in charge of the British Vice-Consulate at Musal announces the appointment of a Persian Consul (or Vice-Consul ?) at that place. The officer, Mirza Ismail Khan (with the title of Farid-us-Sultana), arrived towards the end of February via Kirkuk, and subsequently dined with our Dragoman. He is going to make Kirkuk his headquarters because there are some 500 Persian families there and at Sulaimaniyah, etc. He appears to have formerly been Persian Consul at Karbala. VI.— Foreign Interests other than British or Persian. 1. Our Vice-Consul at Karbala tells me that Russia is about to be represented in that town by a Vice-Consul called Doctor ’Abdul Rahman, a native of Samar- qand ; he is expected in a month or so. The Ottoman Bank is supposed to have received instructions from the Russian Foreign Ministry to pay him at the rateof £ T. 5fl per mensem with effect from the 1st January last, but this is highly im probable. The Consular Agent at Najaf has been promised some pay during either this or next year ! 2 . I have not been able to obtain any definite information regarding the * „ , A „ , rT . “ regrettable incident* at Samarah Young ee ftS ummary ’ ' • Mr. Xanthopoulo was brought in to Bagh dad and handed over to the Austrian Consul, and it is stated that a formal enquiry is to be held here. The corpse of the Arab who was shot is supposed to have been exhumed and examined by two Turkish doctors (sent from here) in order to ascertain the bore of the revolver used against him. Three revolvers are said to have been seized at Samarrah, one belonging to Mr. Xanthopoulo. I am inclined to think that there was a woman in the business, and that Meissner Pasha having paid £T.?00 to compensate the family of the deceased, we shall not hear much more of the affair. 3. As regards the Baghdad Railway, I met Meissner Pasha at dinner a few nights ago. He said that in four or five years navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris would, as a profitable business, be a “dead bird ” and that the Germans were putting money into the new Navigation Company—paragraph 3, Part II supra—or\\y to the same extent as in the “ Societe des Transports fluviauz en Orient For the bringing up of material for the railway from Basrah he still relies largely on sailing boats, and he does not expect that the line will be open to Samaichah before the 1st June and to Samarrah before the 1st November or December. VII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. Miss Gertrude Lothian Bell,t the traveller and the archaeologist, arrived t See Summary for February-March 1911, at Baghdad from Karbala on the 24th VIIL 4 - ’ March. She had, I understand, made a most satisfactory journey from Damascus via Hail (the capital of AmirJ Ibn Rashid). At the time she arrived and for J See paragraph 23, Par, I, eapra. a fo&lt;tn;ght after&gt; Mrs Erskine was confi ned to her bed owing to an accident on the “ Comet ” during our trip to Basrah, and we were unable to put up Miss Bell at the Residency. She left on the J 3th April with the idea of going West by North-West to Damascus, and thence Home via Constantinople. Our other distinguished visitors during the period under report include Comte Gonzague Costa De Beauregard w T ho, having completed a tour in India, was on his way to Paris by the Baghdad-Aleppo rpute.

L 1416 .ismJ 2 i] SUMMARY OF EVENTS IN TURKISH 'IRAQ DURING NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 1913 AND JANUARY 1914. I.—Internal Affairs. (a) Baghdad Wilayat. . The Province has been under three different Walis during the period under r PK /a y&gt; o-f 11700 Tolol Ti/iir 5 ! 4 nrlir. ■. - a - ^ See Summaries for June 1913» I. 8, and July 1913, I. 10 and IV. 9. report. The first was Jalal Bey*, who occupied the post for only five months and left for Constantinople via Aleppo on the 26th November. His dismissal or recall was apparently unexpected and is said to have been due to the action he took in the matter, of the trial of the Arab who was „ charged with shooting Ahmadf Bey, the t See Summary for August 1913, I. n. kte Gendarmerie Commandant and a rela tive or great friend of the Minister of the Interior. On Jalal Bey’s departure, MuhammadJ Fazil Pasha, the ‘‘ Grand old * Soe Summary for Au g ust 1913&gt; L 2 ' Man ” of Mesopotamia, became acting Wali in addition to his duties as Inspector of the 4th Army, and continued as such till the 19th January. He is a delightful old Circassian gentleman, whom I had the pleasure of rfieeting on four or five occasions, and our official relations were most friendly. The present Wali is General Djavid Pasha, whose force retreated to Avlona in the late Balkan war and who had previously served in Albania. He arrived at Baghdad from Aleppo on the 18th January and assumed charge on the following day. For some days previously there had been rumours that, though gazetted Wali and Commander of the 13th Army Corps, the latter part of this order had been cancelled and he was to be Wali only. Nevertheless in his first letter to me (dated January 20th) he signed as “ Governor-General and Commander of the 13th Armv Corps”. Still the same rumour continued, and a few days later the local newspaper “ Zuhur ” announced that the Sultan had issued an irdde appointing Djavid Pasha “ Inspector of the 4th Army ” as well as Wali. This was confirmed by the Walks next letter to me which he signed as “ Governor-General and Inspector of the 4th army”. The fact that his Farmdn of appointment has not yet (February 6th) been read seems to indicate that there is a hitch somewhere. 2. The Wali having fixed the 21st January for the reception of the “ Corps Consulaire ” and the 24th idem (“ between 2 and 3 p.m. ”) for his return visit, I called on His Excellency at the appointed time on the date first mentioned and was accompanied by the Residency Surgeon, the Officer Commanding the “ Comet ” and my first Dragoman. The return visit, though fixed by the Wali for 2-3 p.m. on the 24th—as I have said—was not paid till 4-30 p.m. I believe, how ever, that the mistake was due either to the new Director of Foreign Affairs or to the Walks Dragoman, a youth whose manners are frequently capable of improve ment. Djavid Pasha talks French well and was very affable on both the above occa sions ; it is too early to give an opinion of him. He has brought with him a motor car saM to be the gift of the Turkish Government—and he has wisely shown his independence by insisting on paying house rent and by declining to have anything , T . 1A10 t'ito to do with the “ maison de vakf ”§ the § ^Summary for July 1913. IV.9. prop e rty 0 f the notorious ’Abdul Qadir Pasha Khadairi—which was occupied by his three immediate (substantive) predecessors. 3. The trouble at SamawahlJ on the Euphrates still continues. Naji Effendi „ ^ , im o t 4 was at first rather successful, but street '• fighting soon followed, and reinforce ments had to be sent from Baghdad first in November and next in December. Saiyid Tafiar, whose surrender the Turkish Government demanded, has, it is said, married into the Zaiyad tribe and will never be given up. The latest reports are that the majority of the troops have returned to their headquarters and that a settlement of sorts has been arrived at, but that peace is only likely to be tem porary. C726FD 11APR1914 India, Forf^n Secreiary's No j3 •v'l, dated 26 MAR 1914* 2 4. Towards the end of January there was fighting between the Arabs of Aziziyah and Kut on the Tigris. The \\ ali at once sent troops out to keep order. 5. There is no sign here of preparations for the election of deputies to the T urkish Chamber ; the Local Government have not yet drawn up a list of those entitled to vote. Apparently an election is deemed to be imminent for anony mous letters and circulars have been found in the streets of Baghdad advising the people not to vote for members of the Committee of Union and Progress. The latter are endeavouring, through their supporters at Constantinople, to have all influential anti-Committee officials removed, and Musa Chalabi Pachaji, the Director of the Law School here, has been the first to suffer. 6. Subscription lists are in circulation here for three distinct objects, viz., (a) for the poor of Adrianople, (6) to meet the last instalment (half a million lirahs, due for the new “ Dreadnought ”, and (c) for an airship for the Government. All I have heard about (a) is that a Committee has been appointed with the Naqib of Baghdad as President and ’Abdul Qadir Khadairi as one of the members. As regards (b), £ T. 25,000 are wanted from this Wilayat, and each official has been required to give a month’s salary. The public have as yet contributed little or nothing. Subscriptions for the third object are apparently being collected by the ladies from amongst themselves, and their efforts to date are reported to amount to some £ T. 53. 7. It is said that ’Abdul Qadir Pasha (mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 6 supra) is being employed by some one to * See Summaries for September 1913, I. 6 ; bring about a settlement between Shaikh June 1913, I. 5; and March 1913, lost- Qhadhban* of the Bani Lam and the script, etc. Turkish Government. The people of ’Amarah greatly dread Ghadhban’s being pardoned and allowed to live near the Tigris,, again. The Shr.ikh is at present followed by about 350 “houses” only, but once he returned his supporters would increase and there would probably be fighting and trouble on the river in the Bani Lam reaches as in the old days. It is not known who is employing ’ Abdul Qadir as a go-between, but it is believed not to be the Government. Perhaps Ghadhban has offered money to Saiyidf Talib Bey of Basrah, who in turn has t See paragraph (6) ii-io, mfra. sought the assistance of ’Abdul Qadir, now reported to have joined the Nationalists. 8. There is now a daily post to and from Constantinople w'd Aleppo, and the service has improved very much of late. There were rumours in December that Prance was about to take over all the postal arrangements in the Empire as a security for the big loan she is about to make to the Sublime Porte. There has also been talk of instituting wireless telegraphy between here and Basrah and other places. 9. An Association, the object of which is to further education among the Christians of this Wilayat, has been formed and is styled “ Nadi-i-Ikha ” or the “ Fraternity Club ”. The Honorary Secretary is ’Abdul Jabbar Effendi Khayyat. 10. Robberies in Baghdad are not uncommon, especially in the Jewish quarter, and from what I hear the Wali is determined to put them down with a strong hand. (6) Basrah Wilayat. 11. The “ Nationalist campaign still continues at Basrah. Early in Novem- ^ , iniorm b er there was talk of holding a conference + at or near Kuwait tor the discussion of reforms and Arab political interests. The following, among others, were said to be going to attend, viz., representatives of {a) the Shariff of Makkah, (b) Ibn Sa’ud,§ Amir of southern Najd, (c) Ibn Rashid,)| Amir of Jabal Shammar (d) ’Ajaimi,Tf Shaikh of the Muntafik, toge ther with the well-known Saiyid** Talib, Naqibzadah and several others. The news is said to have been published in a Baghdad paper styled “An Nahdhi ”-j'f which shortly after ceased to exist.

The British Consul at Basrah reports (under date 2_n&lt;! December) having received a copy of a Mazbata in Turkish which he understands was sealed or signed in many cases unwillingly or under compulsion—by some 80 inhabitants of the place and telegraphed to the Minister of War at Constantinople. Mr Crow was , of opinion that the document emanated * See previous paragraph. from Saiyid* Talib Bey who was said to be dissatisfied with the judicial proceedings in connection with the murder to ne mssausnea j ^ Farid .|. The MazbaUi opens with t See Summary for June 1913, 1.1. ^ reference (i) to the loyalty of the in- habitants of the Province in spite of much oppression at the ha '^.^ trators to the services they have constantly rendered, and (in) to the pecu 'a^l^ce thefhave ungrudgingly givmi to the Turkish Government. Regre is expressed that, instead of conferring benefits and advantages on those who have served them wel the authorities still pay attention to the false reports of evil d^actoraand intriguers. The Minister of War is reminded that sold^nd civilians are brothers and is implored to prevent the effusion of blood which must result from a fratricidal war. A demand is next made that the F^id Bey case be tried in any Wilayat of the Empire except Baghdad or Musal, the W ah of which loii-pr Province IN* 1 rift Bev) enjoys an infamous reputation.

Bear in mind, Sir, the provinces already lost, the recent wars and their resu s, the independence of Yemen and Albania! Have mercy on your fatherland, your State and your people 1 Such is the outcome of misdirected efforts 1 May God guide our rulers aright! ”. 13. Mr. Crow further reports that the parliamentary elections ended at Basrah at the beginning of January with the follow ing results . § See two preceding paragraphs. || See Summary for October 1912, I. 15. Saiyid Talib§ Bey Votes. 252 Ahmad Na’im!| Bey .. 233 ’Abdullah Sahib 231 Sulaiman Faizi 230 Haji Assa Effendi 226 ’Abdul Bazzak|| Na’ama 220 Saiyid Talib, it is said, proposes to resign. All the above are members of the Liberal party, and the Committee of Union and Progress find no supporters here. The Baghdad newspaper “ Zuhur ” describes the fifth member as Tsa Bahi Effendi and the sixth as ’Abdur Bazzak Chalabi Namazadeh ; it criticises the manner in which the elections were held and remarks that, looking to the number of electors, there are too many delegates. 14. On the French paper “ Matin ” announcing that the Arabs at Basrah had hoisted the British in place of the Turkish flag, Saiyid Talib (so frequently mentioned above) is said to have telegraphed to the Ministers of War and the Interior assuring them that the statement was incorrect and that the inhabitants of the M ilayat were most faithful subjects of the Sultan, etc. He is supposed to have been thanked for his message. 15. As in Baghdad,H subscriptions are being collected to meet the cost of the new “ Dreadnought ”, it is reported that u See paragraph (a) 6 supra. £ T g.OQO—including £ T. 700 given by Saiyid Talib and his two sons (students at Constantinople)—have already been collected at Basrah.4 16. It was given out in Baghdad that Colonel Vehib Bey, who was 2nd-in-com- mand at Yanina during the late siege, had been appointed Wali of Basrah in succes- * See Summary for July 1913, 1, i. sion to Ala-ud-din Be^y who was dismissed last July, but this arrangement was sub sequently cancelled and the new Wali is to be Sulaiman Shafiq Pasha, lately Com mander of the 8th Army Corps. 17. The 2nd battalion of the 111th Begiment left for Baghdad on the 9th December, and the military garrison of the Basrah Sanjaq is reported to consist of the following troops :— Infantry — 38th Battalion, “ Nishanji ” .. 2nd Battalion, 112th Regiment 3rd Battalion, 112th Regiment Artillery —• 2 field guns 2 mountain guns 2 quick-firing guns .. 2 “ Mitrailleuses ” .. Total . 18. The Political Agent at Kuwait (in his precis of news for December) men tions having received a report in the second week of that month to the effect that + Q ... Shaikh Ajaimif had raided the Thaffir J See Summary for May 1913,1. 7.

Shaikh 'Ajaimi is said to have sent men to assist the latter. The cause of the quarrel is not known. (c) Musal Wilayat. 19. Musal news comes mostly from the Dragoman in charge of the British Vice- § See Summary for June 1913, IV. 14. Consulate there and is probably not verv . reliable. There has been no Vice-Consul since Mr. Hony§ left some seven months ago. 20. Asad || Pasha, Commandant of the 12th Army Corps, acted as Mali till || See Summary for October 1913 ,1. 6. November 19th, when Sulaiman^j Nazif Tf See Summary for September 1913 , I. 2 . Bey arrived and took over charge. The T ^ , two are on bad terms, and As ad Pasha has, 1 am told, unsuccessfully tried to arrange a transfer for himself. The new Wali who appears to see much of the German Vice-Consul, seems to have devoted a good deal of his time and attention to “ public works”, such as a bridge across the Tigris at Musal, the improvement of communications in the district and the opening of a new road (20 metres in width) in the town itself. In connection with the latter project (w hich has been started) some 24 houses belonging to Ottoman subjects have been demolished in part or in whole, and the Municipality have declined to pay anv compensation, but further progress has been stayed by the strong attitude tuken up by the Roman Catholic Fathers (of French nationality) whose property is threaten ed and who decline to allow their houses to be cut into or to give up a single metre of land. 21. Unrest and disorder continue to prevail in this District. Rafts and cara- vans have been looted; the Baghdad mails were held up between Erbil and Musal and then permitted to proceed minus one bag containing £ T. 500 ; and five Gendarmerie officers (formerly in service at Salonika) were, while en route to join the W ah, relieved by Arab horsemen of their rifles and other valuables. _ _ The Dragoman mentions the receipt of a letter dated 6th December 1913, from J. D. Bernard and George Reed ”—said to be missionaries— Men. 180 130 200 ;;1 ► 20 5305 reporting that six boys, while on their way to the “ Mission School ”, were attack ed by robbers near Sar ’Amadiyah. Four of the lads escaped, but two were killed. The Dragoman lost no time in interviewing the acting Wali, who sent a strongly- worded letter to the Qaim-Maqam of ’Amadiyah, and apparently six persons were subsequently arrested. No further progress seems to have been made, and I understand that the Qaim-Maqam has lately been removed for failure to deal with the case energetically. The boys referred to above were of course Ottoman subjects, and it is believed that the school to which they were going is the Arch bishop of Canterbury’s Mission School at Bibaidi.* Dr. Johnson of the Church Missionary Society here tells me that he * See Summaries for March-April 1912, heard nothing of the case on his recent V. 10 and October 1913, I. 9. visit to Musxl. 23. A decoration—said by some to have been an Osmanieh and by others a Mejidieh—having been received from Constantinople for presentation, to ’Abdus Salam, the Shaikh of Baraizan,| the Wali t See Summary for July 1913, . 7- . returned the same, remarking that the Shaikh was a robber and a murderer deserving a fatal bullet rather than a deco ration. The Shaikh, on hearing this, became very angry and staited raiding in the vicinity of ’Aqrah. 24. ’Abdul Latif Agha, the brother-in-law of the Shaikh of Baraizan, re cently returned from Makkah bringing with him 30 rifles, which are said to have been either used by the Greek troops or captured by them in the late war. The arms have been confiscated. 25. The Turkish troops under one Talib Bey are stated to have lately had the worst of it in an encounter with the HarkiyahJ tribe (Kurds) near ’Aqrah. , inio T The latest reports, however, are to the {See Summary for October 1913, 1.9. ^ effect ^ ^ o{ ^ Harkiyah has come to Musal, made friends with the Wali and will, with other Kurdish chief tains, join him in attacking the Shaikh of Baraizan. 26. I am informed that, treasonable papers having been found in the house of Captain Abdullah Effendi Jenabaz, the latter was arrested by orders of the Wali. He has been tried, sentenced to death and sent to Constantinople under custody. Abdullah Effendi is a Kurd, a Government pensioner and a friend of § See Summary for February-March 1911, Lieutenant-Colonel Safwat§ Bey, who was I. 2 and v. io. the officer through whom a settlement was arranged, under the late Nazim Pasha’s orders, with the Shaikh of Baraizan in 1910. When Nazim Pasha became Minister of War, he appointed Safwat Bey as Commander in Constantinople, and it is believed that the latter was sen tenced to death in connection with the assassination of Mahmud|| Shavket Pasha, the Grand Yazir of Turkey. Safwat Bey II See Summary for June 1913, I. 6. now j n Musal Wilayat or its vicinity, and the Wali has received orders to arrest him. A reward of £ T. 200 has been offered for information which will lead to the officer’s capture. 27. It is rumoured that the Mutasarrif of Bashkala in the district of Van has, with the aid of the local military forces, demolished the fort of Saiyid Taha^f (who is said to be under Russian protection) See Summary for October 1913, I\. 1. an( j twelve of his followers. The fort is mentioned as being at Nizi, close to the Persian frontier. II.— British Interests and Cases. 1 The great event of the period under report (so far as British interests were concerned) was the formal opening of the Hindiyah Barrage** orjthe 12thNovem ber 1913. The firm of Sir John Jackson, ** See Summary for October 1913, II. 1-2. Limited, had issued invitations to the Governor-General, the chief Government officials, the various Consuls and the prin cipal people residing in and about Baghdad, and the majority of the guests reached Hindiyah on the evening of December 11th and were most hospitably enter tained The Consuls were, I regret to say, somewhat conspicuous by their ab sence, only four (out of ten) attending, viz., the Persian Consul-General, the French Consul (who rode over from Babylon, where he was on a visit), the Consul for C726FDSweden (in the person of Mr. Tod, a Scottish “ international ” at the Rugby game and the Baghdad Manager of Stephen Lynch and Company) and myself. Meissner Pasha, the energetic and popular Chief Engineer of the Baghdad Rail way, was, however, present, and I travelled about half of the way with him. Owing to the recent rain, the “ road ” between Sikandariyah and Musaiyib was in a terrible condition. 2. As the waters had already been diverted through the Barrage in order to allow the dam across the old bed of the Euphrates to be completed, the ceremony was arranged to take place on the Hillah Canal, the head of which is about 450 metres above the Barrage. Across this canal and a short distance below the regulator a temporary earthen dam had been built, and the demolition of this dam would supply the first waters to the Hillah Canal. Opposite to the dam a marquee had been erected, and thither at 9-30 a.m. the acting Wali, his staff, guests, etc., proceeded, accompanied by mounted and unmounted troops and military bands. Arrived there, Mr. Arthur Whi%ly (the firm’s chief representative in Meso potamia) made a speech in French. He began by thanking His Excellency and suite and others for having come there to perform and assist at the inauguration of this first completed irrigation work—a work which “ was destined to bring back to the Babylonian realms the prosperity which had so long been lost through want of water ” and which would “ assure a perennial supply to the district affected.” He thought that the day would become “ historical in the annals of Mesopotamia as the first step towards revivifying a country which in past times was cele brated for its productions.” He next gave the history of the project in the follow ing sentences : “ By the sage advice of the Minister of Public Works at Stamboul, Sir William Willcocks was commissioned by the Ottoman Government to survey and prepare plans embodying irrigation schemes for the whole of the delta of Mesopotamia. The majority of these plans were ready in 1910, and it was at once decided to commence the works of the Hindiyah Barrage and the Habbaniyah Escape, both'on the Euphrates. The former was for the purpose of distributing water from the river to the various canals above its site, and more particularly to the Hillah Canal (the old bed of the Euphrates), while the Habbaniyah Escape was designed for the purpose of taking off and storing the flood waters which were the cause of disastrous inundations annually during the months of April and May. So pressing was the matter that Sir William Willcocks commenced these two works while the OttomamGovernment made arrangements with a firm of contractors for their further construction. In February 1911 the Government made a contract with Sir John Jackson, Limited, of London, and the firm startel operations immediately after. The works here consist of (a) the Barrage with 36 openings—each 5 metres wide by 7 metres high—provided with steel gates for regulating the distribution of water ; (b) a submerged barrage which replaces the old rubble one (situated about 700 metres below) ; (c) two navigation locks ; (d) a head regulator for the Hillah Canal; and (e) various other subsidiary items. To-day sees the completion of the essential portion of the project, but there remain still the strengthening of the earthen dam across the Euphrates and some minor works.” Mr. Whitley then referred to the difficulties encountered, and explained that he was not alluding to those of construction which every Engineer engaged in such operations expected to meet and to surmount. He asked his hearers to cast back to the last two years, aj d they would realise that this had been a very difficult period for the Ministers at Stamboul; yet, in spite of all, work had progressed, and the country should offer thanks and congratulations to the Ministry and to the Governor-General and officials at Baghdad for having overcome obstacles which at times appeared colossal. He concluded by observing that the firm which he represented had had the honour of bringing this work to a successful conclusion and, bearing in mind the fact that the designer, Sir William Willcocks, attached great importance to the Hindiyah Barrage and Habbaniyah Escape being operative at the same time, he expressed the hope that circumstances would permit of his soon being in a position to hand over to the Governnynt the second of these projects duly completed. 3 . The reply of the acting Wali (Muhammad Fazil Pasha), which was in Turkish and brief, was read out by some Secretary or other official. His Excellency congratulated everybody concerned, thanked those present for coming to assist* He refers to the gates of the head regulator. K. D. E. him in the inauguration ceremony, and, before declaring the canal open, said But, the canal, which is to take the place of the ancient bed of the Euphrates and the six gates constructed at the head of the canal* may not be sufficient for the irri gation of this immense District and its inhabi tants, and I promise by the grace of God that I will do my best to rectify this shortcoming and to arrange for other necessary works to assure the life and good of this Lira (district).” (With reference to the above, I should explain that, during the previous 24 hours, His Excellency had been inundated with telegrams and peti tions complaining that an insufficient volume of water would go down to Hillah, and he unofficially gave out on the morning of the 12 th December that he would only open the Barrage provisionally. Mr. Whitley and others (including Meissner Pasha) persuaded him not to do so. I may add that telegrams from the inhabitants of Hillah, which appeared in the “ Zuhur ” newspaper some ten or twelve days later, were to the effect that sufficient water was being received, and I have continued to hear the same from other sources.) 4. The speeches being over, the Wali and some of the principal personages des cended by means of a speed staircase to the temporary dam, where a priest recited a prayer during which the Moslems stood at attention with the palms of their hands extended upwards and repeated “ Amin ” at the end of each sentence. Twenty sheep having been sacrificed on the dam and the Wali and a few others having removed a spadeful or two of earth therefrom, the party returned to the canal bank. A gang of some twenty labourers had been kept handy on the opposite side and at a given signal they dashed down to remove the last obstacle to the progress of the water towards Hillah. This did not take long and in about five minutes, amidst general cheering, the shrill cries of women, the firing of shots into the air by mount* ed Arabs, etc., the water broke through and proceeded do a n the canal. A few Arab women rushed into the water and bathed confident—it is said—that, by so doing, they would in due course beget male (as opposed to female) offspring. The assem- blv lining both banks must have numbered about 6,000 and included many Arabs, with whom Muhammad Pasha seemed to be most popular. 5. After the ceremony Sir John Jackson, Limited, entertained the chief visitors to lunch—about 150 being present—and at its close more speeches were made by, among others, the Wali, Meissner Pasha, Mr. Whitley, Mr. Warbrick (the resi dent Engineer), and Mr. Edmond Becharah,f t See Summary for Apni 1913, II. 2 . (the Engineer-in-chief of the Ottoman Government for Irrigation in Mesopotamia). The latter made an excellent, though somewhat lengthy, speech and incidentally gave the expenditure to date as about + 0 0 k r iqis tt 2 £ T. 380,000. I notice that my prede- i See Summary for October Ulu, ll. ^ • j. o* itt’ii* 117*11 1 * a. + cessors gaveJ bir W illiam W illcocks estimate as £ T. 284,740. This was correct so far as it went, but it did not go far enough. Certain works proposed by Sir William and estimated to cost £ T. 50,000 were not carried out, but certain other works (estimated to cost £ T. 82,000) took their place and have been completed. Mr. Whitley considers that Mr. Becharah's figures (£ T. 380,000) are approximately correct ; this sum includes the cost of the survey by Sir William Willcocks and the money spent by him before Sir John Jackson, Limited, took over charge as contractors. 6 The speeches being over, the party broke up, and the Wali and most of the guests returned at once to Baghdad. The proceedings, though marred by damp cold weather, were entirely successful. Sir John Jackson, Limited, gave a very sporting dance at the Babylon Hotel on December 20th,’ at which all Baghdad were present and which is said to have been the best thing of its kind ever done here. Towards the end of January, it was heard that His Majesty the Sultan had been pleased to confer the order of theOsmanieh (3rd class) on Mr. Whitley and the Mejidieh ( 3 rd class) on Mr. Warbrick, the resident Engineer m charge of the works. 7 7 As for the Habbaniyah Escape, work continues on the small scale followed heretofore Mr Whitley and his staff are awaiting orders as to whether they should proceed there and start operations seriously or should pack up and leave Traq. In this connection I should mention the receipt of a communication from8 Messrs. S. Pearson and Son, Limited, Contractors of 10 Victoria Street Westminster, enclosing a letter addressed to the Wali of Baghdad, in which they express their * See Summary for F-:\ruary-March 1911, readiness to recommence* negotiations for VIIL 2 - the financing and carrying out of some of the irrigation works suggested for Mesopotamia by Sir William Willcocks and intimated that they had also written to the Ministry of Public Works at Constantinople in the same sense. I passed on the above letter to His Excellency on the 7th January, but have as yet received no reply. Messrs. Pearson and Son, I understand, spent large sums of money in the preparation of estimates and surveys some six or seven years ago, and I trust that, should the Ottoman Government decide to carry out the irri gation scheme in sections, their claims will not be overlooked. 8 . Events of minor local interests are:— (a) a change in the managership of the t See Summary for April 1913 , II. 5. Eastern Bank.t Limited, Mr. L. F. Tucker (a brother of Captain T. H. St. G. Tucker of the Indian Political Department) having relieved Mr. Ware, who has been seriously ill with typhoid fever and will go home when fit to travel ; (b) the ap pointment of Mr. J. S. Levack as Manager of Messrs. David Sassoon and Company, Limited, vice Mr. M. R. Solomon; (c) the receipt of orders from the Foreign Office, ^ ^ , London, that the Consulate-General is J See Summary for December 1912 II. 3. i , j . , r ^ r tt i i ^. 14 . to extend to the nrm of Moulds wort 114 Hougie and Company the same protection as would be accorded to the branch of a British firm ; and (d) the continued failure § of Mr. Wilson, the Manager of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, Limited, to obtain permission to erect tanks in the vicinity of Baghdad city for the storage of oil in bulk. It will be remembered that II See Summary for May 1912, viii. 4. some time a g° another British subjeetj| tried for more than two years to get permission to establish a private kerosine store. He gave up the idea in disgust. The law on the subject is clear, and Mr. Wilson has complied with its requirements. The Municipality have approved the site (near Garara down the river) and the plan of the proposed building and are to be at liberty to make inspections when they please, but still formal sanction is, for some reason or other, withheld. I am doing my best to expedite the case. Messrs. Strick, Scott having been allowed some time ago to construct similar tanks at Basrah, anticipated no difficulties here and have imported almost r.U of the necessary and up-to-date material, It may be that the sight of the latter has given rise to the rumour that the British propose to erect a fort, not a gaz-khdna. 9. I am informed that there are about 1,000 oil engines—mostly of British manufacture—now in use here for irrigation purposes, and the area irrigated by It One hectare equals 2-471 acres. the 8511116 is estimated at 130,000 Before the importation of these pumps, the area irrigated by means of indigenous water-lifts was approximately 13,000 hectares only. Some 300 engines are said to be imported annually. III.— British Indian Interests. § See Summary for July 1913, Nos. II. 3. 1. The arrangements introduced by my predecessor for protecting and assist ** See Summary for August 1913 , in. 2. in S Indian pilgrims** who visit these parts continue to work well, and I have receiv ed several letters acknowledging the good services rendered by the Pilgrim Guides. 2. From the number of Indian pilgrims who come to me almost weekly with alleged empty pockets and ask for pecuniary assistance to enable them to return to their country and feed themselves on the journey thither, it would seem that the great majority of them start from India insufficiently provided with funds. No doubt a few may be robbed here or experience bad luck in other ways, e.&lt;/., illness necessitating a stay longer than was intended, and in such cases it is not difficult—^provided the trouble be reported without dealy—to get the truth and afford the necessary relief, but an erroneous idea seems to prevail that there is a large amount of Oudh Bequest money set apart for the sole purpose of helping Indian pilgrims back to their homes. I am issuing instructions with a view to having the real state of affairs and the proper procedure made known, and I trust that what is at present a nuisance will cease. \9 IV.—British Official Matters. 1 . I arrived at Baghdad on the night of November 20th and, with Mr. Lorimer, called on the Wall (Jalal Bey), the Inspector of the 4th Army and acting Wali-elect (Muhammad Fazil Pasha) and the various Consuls on the morning of * See Summary for October 1913, IV. 10 . th® 24th idem. The same afternoon I took over charge* from Mr. Lorimer, who left the next day in the “ Comet ” for Basrah en route to Bushire. 2. The new Residency Guard (from the 102nd King Edward's Own Grena diers) arrived at Baghdad on the 29th December. Some two or three days earlier, the Customs authorities, having heard that they were coming, informed my 1st Dragoman that, without orders from the Wilayat, the men would not be allowed to land “ with their arms”, they said nothing about “ammunition”. Endeavours were made to settle this matter without troubling the acting Wali, but the Head Mudir remained obdurate, pointing out that no rifles could be im ported without special permission. My Dragoman then approached His Excel lency, who immediately wrote out an order directing the Customs authorities to pass the rifles and other effects of the relieving and relieved guards ; there was no further difficulty. The new Guard are all Gujars and tall men ; it is a strange coincidence that almost all of them—including the Indian officer—come from the Eastern States of Rajputana where I last served. The old Guard (from the 2nd Queen Victoria’s Own Rajput Light Infantry)—a smart body of men—left Baghdad the following day. 3. In execution of the decree passed by the Additional Judge of His Britannic Majesty’s Provincial Court here in favour of Charles Sidebotham and against Messrs. Mashal Brotherst—regarding which t See Summary for August 1913, . . there was a good deal of correspondence in September-October last between my predecessor and the British Embassy at Constantinople—I caused a consignment of goods addressed to the judgment- debtors to be seized on arrival at Baghdad. The goods, which consisted mostly of machinery, belting, etc., had come from Manchester in the “ Locksley Hall ” as far as Basrah and thence to Baghdad in the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi gation Company’s steamer “ Khalifah ”. In pursuance of the “ warrant of exe cution ” Messrs. Lynch and Company (the agents of the Company just mentioned) made out the “ delivery order ” in favour of the Marshal of the Court (the person named in the above warrant). The local representative of Mashal Brothers obtained an order from the Procure General (or some such official) to the effect that the consignment was to be handed over to Messrs. Mashal Brothers, the hold- 0 , ers of the Bill of Lading, but the Customs authorities were on thisj occasion on my side and replied that they would hand the articles over only to the persons named in the delivery order. After the usual period, the goods were sold by public auction at the Residency and the net proceeds (after meeting Court costs, customs duty, auctioneer’s fees, etc.,) amounted to £ T. 203. This sum was duly handed over to Charles Sidebotham in part settlement of his decree for £220 sterling, and he left shortly after for the place whence became, viz., Manchester. My acknowledgments are due to Mr. Crow for his timely notice of the approach of the consignment and details enabling me to identiMt ajid to the Customs officials at Baghdad for their general helpfulness ; nor should I fail to mention the pro prietors a Turk and a Persian—of the Tigris Hotel, in which Sidebotham has been living “ on credit ” since July last. These men very generously provided him with board and lodging and left the rest to chance and the word of a Britisher ! 4 . One of the last acts of Mr. Lorimer before he left Baghdad was to reprimand Maulvi Saiyid§ Ahmad, the Indian Distri- § See Summary for October 191 , . • butor at Najaf, for having secretly written to him a letter containing numerous charges against a number of people including the Vice-Consul and in a tone which showed that his object was to damage opponents or those who did not see eye-to-eye with him rather than to serve public interests, and also to order that he be placed last (instead of last but two) on the precedence list of the Mujtahid Distributors of the Oudh Bequest Committee at Najaf. The reprimand, which was administered in my presence, has so far had the desired effect. C726FD5 . Mr. Probyn Smith, Personal Assistant to the Postmaster-General of Bombay, spent ten days heie in January, enquiring into the unsatisfactory state of , c + iqis tv 9 affairs at the British Post* Office. The • See Summery for September 1913, IV. 2. pos) . between Alep p 0 and Baghdad and vice versa has of late improved considerably and is being more and more patronised by those who have correspondence with Europe, and there are complaints of slowness in delivery at our office. I discussed the situation with Mr Probyn Smith, whose inspection was a thorough one, and I have suggested to the Postmaster-General that the staff be slightly strengthened. The Director- General has already issued an order that no Turkish subject is in future to be employed at any Indian post office in Turkish Arabia without the express consent of the Consul-General at Baghdad, and that all irregularities of the kind disclosed in the present case are to be reported at once to the Chief Political Officer at the place where they occur. Mr. Bharucha, our Postmaster, holds a responsible posi tion as he has frequently to correspond with the banks and big business houses, as well as with the foreign Consulates, and is so far doing well. 6 Under instructions from the Resident in the Persian Gulf, Major C. C. R. Murphy Intelligence Officer, visited Baghdad in January to enquire into the alleged traffic in arms and ammunition. It had been reported that the tribes in Lunstan were arming themselves with rifles which reached them through Baghdad and Basrah and that large quantities of arms and ammunition were entering the Gulf through Baghdad from the north. I gave Major Murphy all possible assistance, but I doubt whether the report is correct so far as Baghdad is concerned. The authorities here are very strict about the importation of rifles, and I know a Captain Cowley (of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company) who, though talking Arabic fluently, has tried for months — and unsuccessfully—to &amp; purchase an ordinary rifle here for sporting t See paragraph (c) ^4 supra. , purposes. I have already! mentioned the recent seizure of arms in the Musal Wilayat, and my information is that the rifles brought into Luristan and the Persian districts on the Turkish frontier come from Russia. The matter will continue to receive attention. 7 . Annexure A at the end of this Summary shows the work done at the Resi dency Dispensary during the three months under report. The Residency Surgeon informs me that attendance is always lowest in the cold wet winter months. Y.—Persian Affairs. 1 The road from Kirmanshah to the Turkish frontier is reported to be safe, and the illegal fees collected by the road-guards have been stopped, the guards now receiving pay from the local treasury. 2 . The telegraph line has already been completed to Ser-i-pul Zohab and will shortly be through to Kasr. 3 M Depleske, son of the Russian Einance Minister, ws^as at Kirmanshah for some ten days collecting trade statistics and interviewing/ merchants. As most of the latter are either fully committed to Manchester or Baghdad Jews connected with that city, he is not believed to have the success he desired, and he left for Hamadan. YX. Foreign Interests other than British or Persian. 1 Mr. Xanthopoulo, { the Austro-Hungarian Consul here, has just retired u im o q after more than 40 years’service, but he will J See Summary for September 1913, IV. 8. ^ Baghdad for a couple of months or so. He has been succeeded by Mr. Ladislas de Tahy, who has given up the old Austrian Consulate and taken up his residence in the house§ of ’Abdul Qadir Khadairi on the eastern bank of the river. § See end of paragraph (a) 2 supra. Dozon,]| the French Consul, and Mr. II See Summary for May 1913, vi. 5 and 7. p 0 p 0 ft ? || acting Russian Consul-General, are shortly leaving us. The former is to be followed by a Mr. Guy. 2 . I paid the usual congratulatory calls on the acting Belgian Consul on Novem ber 26th (“ fete patronymique ”) and on the acting Russian Consul-General onDecember 19th (“ fete onomastique ”). The German Consul held an official reception on January 27th (the anniversary of the birth of His Imperial Majesty), which I attended in full dress accompanied by the Residency Surgeon, the Officer Commanding the “ Comet ” and Mr. Gaskin, my Commercial Assistant. The Residency flagstaff and the “ Comet ” were “ dressed ” on the above three occasions. 3. Work on the Baghdad Railway progresses, though not so rapidly as Miessner Pasha wishes. Owing to the large accumulation of material at Basrah—(16,000 tons at'the beginning of November last)—shipments from Germany are being temporarily suspended. According to a statement received by Mr. Crow from Messrs. Lynch and Com] any, the quantity of material imported by the Baghdad Railway Company during 1913 was 34,280 tons, but as this included 1,617 tons of coal and about 2,000 tons of various articles required for the construction of barges and launches, it may be said that the quantity of strictly “ railway ” material imported last year was 30,663 tons. In October last Messrs. Lynch and Company, succeeded for the first time in carrying out their contract with the Railway by for warding 2,500 tons of material in the tugs of the “ Societe de Transports Fluviaux en Orient ”. The Railway Company are buying more land near Basrah, but no precise details are yet available. 4. A regrettable incident has occurred at Samarrah in connection with the railway work at that place. It happened so recently that the real facts are not yet known. It would seem that a large number of Arab labourers, not having been paid for ten days, went to Mr. Xanthopoulo, the Engineer in charge ♦ See paragraph i Of this section. and a son of the late Austrian* Consul, and demanded their wages. He told them that he was not the paymaster and referred them to the proper officer. This was repeated in less polite language by the Circassian watchman, a servant of the Company, who happened to be present. The Arabs got angry and began to abuse the watchman, who replied with interest, and then they set on him and stabbed him once or twice. The watchman pulled out his revolver and shot an Arab dead. Mr. Xanthopoulo is said to be unhurt and to have taken no part in the affray except to try and stop it. The watchman is still alive, and Mr. Xanthopoulo is being brought out of danger by some troops promptly sent up by the Wali. Such is the account as given to me by the new Austrian Consul and some of the German colony. Another version is that the Circassian watchman fired first and was then himself killed. The Arab told the Qaim-Maqam at the prelimi nary investigation that Mr. Xanthopoulo, not the watchman, did the firing. The case is to be enquired into here shortly. VII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. The Turkish members of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, viz.. Major Samih Bey, and Captain Abdul Hamid Bey and three others, arrived here on December 31 st and, after visting Karbala, proceeded to Basrah. Mr. Crow reports that they left for Muhammarah on the 15th January and that the Wilayat, though ordered to purchase 80 horses for them, had not moved in the matter ! The Persian member of the same Commission—with the exception of Tttila-ul-Mulk who had already reached Muhammarah—arrrived here about the same time and included Mansur-us-Sultanah (Assistant Commissioner), Nasir- ullah Cheybani (1st Secretary) and Mirza 'Abdur Razzaq Khan (Chief Engineer). They were in no greater hurry to start work than their Ottoman colleagues for they went to Karbala and Najaf and did not leave Baghdad till January 14th. 2. The Sanitary Commission sent out to enquire into and report on the condition of the various quarantine stations in Traq and other matters and consist ing of Dr. Clemow (British), Dr. Schonberg (German), Dr. Samouel Khan (an Armenian representing Persia), Dr. Walter (Russian) and Dr. Djenab Bey (Turk), spent January in these parts and visited Baghdad, Kazimain, Musaiyib, the Hindiyah Barrage, Karbala, Najaf, Babylon and Khaniqin. They are just returning to Basrah to complete their labours. Dr. Clemow, who was my guest here for ten or twelve days, will go back to Constantinople via India. 3. Among other distinguished visitors may be mentioned the Hon’ble Major- General Birdwood (Secretary to the Government of India, Army Department)12 and Colonel F. Lee (lately officiating Military Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy), whom we had the pleasure to entertain at the Residency. They saw all the usual sights at Babylon, Karbala and in and around Baghdad and, through the kindness of the acting Wali, we visited the Military Factory (a useful and apparently well-run institution, turning out hot and cold weather uniform blankets walking and riding boots, saddles, etc.), the Artillery, Cavalry and n antry lines, and the Military Hospital. The barracks and hospital were fine com modious buildings; the stables were excellent ; and the horses—unfortunately not soon ^ill nearly dusk appeared to be of a good hardy stamp, though deficient in 4. During January the Tigris at Baghdad rose and fell alternately till the reading at the Residency rose to 13f feet on the 25th and 20J feet on the 26th bince then it has dropped to about 8 or 8* feet. A height of 20J feet in January is wdfiout precedent—at any rate during recent years— and the reading on the 26th January 1913 was only 3J feet.

I.—Internal Affairs. 1. In the last week of October, the Assistant Wali of Baghdad, Lutfi Bey*, *Soe last Summary, I— 13 . was still at Musal. He was engaged there t?ee Summary for August, I—16. with Jamal Pasha, Inspector of Gendar merie, in completing the work of the Gendarmerief and Police Reorganisation Commission in those provinces of which he is the President. 2. The sudden departure of Qudrat BeyJ, late Director of Foreign Affairs at +c , , e T Baghdad, seems to have been due to se- nous omcial dimculties in which he had involved himself. In consequence of an assault committed in the French Garden or Club at Baghdad by one member upon another, in regard to which sides were taken, ill-feeling had arisen between Qudrat Bey and Mr. Grabowski, the local Manager of the Imperial Ottoman Bank ; and Qudrat Bey had vindictively sug gested to the Government at Constantinople that the validity of Mr. Grabowski’s title to French nationality, the benefit of which he enjoys, though by race a Pole, should be strictly investigated. Mr. Grabowski, thereupon, wrote to his friend, Ahmad Jamal Bey, who was Wali of Baghdad last year, and is now Military Governor of Constantinople, with the result that Qudrat Bey was officially ordered to apologise to Mr. Grabowski. The official letter, containing this order, came when Lutfi Bey was acting as Wali, and between him and Qudrat Bey it was sup pressed, and a prevaricating answer returned to Constantinople. Later, in the Waliship of Muhammad Zaki Pasha, their action came to the knowledge of Mr. Grabowski, who again had recourse to Jamal Bey; and the order for Qudrat Bey to apologise was reiterated. Qudrat Boy then applied for leave of absence on the ground that his father wished him to get married, and he was told that the leave would be granted, but that the required apology must be made before he left Baghdad. In the end, after vainly attempting to conciliate Mr. Grabowski by assurances short of an apology, Qudrat Bey quitted Baghdad, without obeying the orders of his Government. I mention these unimportant facts because of the present great power of Jamal Bey at Constantinople, and as illustrating the continuation of the close relations, which existed between him and Mr. Grabowski at Adana, and after wards at Baghdad. It is possible that, as is generally believed at Baghdad, complaints by the Per sian Government of Qudrat Bey’s having laid Persian subjects under heavy contri bution, as a preliminary to recognising their nationality, may have had something to do with his abrupt disappearance from Mesopotamia. 3. Sirri Bey, lately§ Mutasarrif of ’Amarah, has been in charge of the Karbala 0 T ,o ^ vr r; Sanjaq during the past month. I saw § See last Summary, I—13 and VI—5. J ^^ something of him at Karbala, while on a tour there which will be mentioned later. He is, as I thought, a member of the Union and Progress party, and he must have influence to have attained his present position so early in life, for he is barely thirty. Personally, he is a fop, though of unwieldy figure ; and in mind he is lethargic and doctrinaire. He described a system, which he had recommended to Constan tinople for subduing the unruly Bani Lam, and others in his late charge of ’ Amarah by studding the country with blockhouses, each mounting a gun, and garrisoned by 15 men, and all connected by wireless telegraphy. It was useless to point out that a smaller number of Arabs with rifles, lying in ditches, could imprison the garrisons of the blockhouses, and so immobilise them, if not starve them into surrendering with their arms. Sirri Bey was also eloquent on a scheme, which he had evolved for policing the read from'Karbala to Shifathah, which he had not as yet so much as seen. C506FD \ 13 DECISIS India, Foreign Secretary’s No 4 8 M, dated NOV 19134. The Samawah* affair has continued to increase in importance, as good judges in tribal matters from the first *See last Summary, 1—8. prophesied that it would. There was con siderable delay in sending off the reinforcement, mentioned last month, due to want of the necessary funds, which were at first refused by the Central Govern ment at Constantinople ; but on energetic representations being made by Muham mad Fazil Pasha, the Inspector-General of the Musal and Baghdad Army Corps, the money was at last provided, and the force marched from Baghdad on the 13th October. On my Karbala tour, already mentioned, I overtook it next day at Mah- mudiyah, and found that it consisted of part of the 31st Cavalry Regiment, two small quick-firing guns, and the 2nd Battalion of the 109th, and the 1st of the 110th Regiments, with about thirty baggage carts. The column was said to be 700 strong, but I greatly doubt whether it even approximated to that figure. There had been a dispute-and, it was asserted, a fight—among some of the officers by the way, and one or more had been placed under arrest. From Mahmudiyah these troops marched to Musaiyib on the Euphrates, and there or at Tawairij, they em barked in boats for Samawah, where they duly arrived in the course of a few days. It must have been resolved ere this to seek a pacific solution of the Samawah difficulty, for the expedition was tSee Summary for April, 1—5. accompanied by Naji Effendif, Suwaidi- zadah, a popular and able Qaim-Maqam or District Officer, belonging to a respect able Arab family at Baghdad, who was charged with the duty of effecting Islahat ^Literally “ reforms,” but in Turkish political An expert in^ Such matters, none Other parlance the meaning is rather “concessions than Shaikh 'Atiyah of Najaf, to whom unpalatable to the Government which, only by j w in refer again further on, assured me inabili^ to impose its wishes, .t.s obliged to ^ absohlfce|y n0 hope that . g aiyjd gr § See Summary for July, 1—6.

Again, on the 13th October a party of about twenty British Indian subjects, going on pilgrimage to Samarrah’ were held up by mounted Arabs, only a few miles from Baghdad. Two mounted gendarmes, who escorted the party, apparently succeeded m beating off the brigands, and the pilgrims escaped without loss; but one of the gendarmes was killed—his’body was subsequently brought back to Kadhimain—and the other wounded. It is said that the slayer of the gendarme has since been captured. On learning that there was no hope of his being appointed substantive Wali of Musal, As’ad Pashalf ceased to show TjSee last Summary, 1—12. an y interest in his civil duties, and applied for and obtained sixteen months’ leave “ for change of air ”. It is doubted whether he will await the arrival at Musal of Sulaiman Nazif Bey, his permanent successor. The last incident of As’ad Pasha’s active administration was a vigorous tussle with the Musal Municipality, whose affairs seemed to him to require probing ; but a Commission, which he appointed with this object, failed to obtain any evidence incriminatory of the City Fathers, and the latter, on this result being announced, locked up the Town Hall, and sent the key to the Acting Wali with a message that they would carry on their duties no longer, as they had been gratuitously insulted. As’ad Pasha then made the amende honorable, and the incident was closed. 7 . It is said that the Turkish authorities have granted £ T. 1,500 to the tribes- men ** of ’Abdullah Baig, who fled over the ** See last Summary, • * border from Persia, after hostilities with Saiyid Taha. The immigrants are at present near Rowanduz, and wish to settle there.3 8 .

Chaldseans, Syrians, Jacobites, and Nesto- rians, not Armenians—are growing more frequent. He states that during the week ending 29th September, eight persons were killed and twelve wounded in the vicinity of Musal town, without any steps being taken by the authorities in consequence. According to his report for the following week, caravans coming in from Baghdad, and also from the mountains, had been plundered; while, at Qaraqosh two Christians had been killed and two wounded, and at Mirki, a village less than a day s journey from Musal, a party of 20 armed Kurds had carried off a Christian woman, belong ing to the Jacobite community. In the former of the two cases last mentione representations were made by the Syrian Catholic Bishop to the Turkish authorities, but without efiect; in the second, however, the woman was recovered, and it was proved that the kidnappers had been one Shaikh ’Abdullah, a Christian mon turned Muhammadan, and a band of Kurdish associates. Towards the end ot October, as reported by the Dragoman^ Kurds attacked the Christian village ot Baratli, only four hours distant from Musal, killing one man, wounding three and carrying off some mules. A caravan arriving from Aleppo was looted by Arabs close to Musal about the same time, a man being killed; “ all roads were closed by the Kurds and the Arabs ; even inside the town murders were taking place. The Dragoman is an Oriental Christian himself, and the apprehensions which he betrays may be exaggerated. If only for this reason it is, perhaps, unfortunate that Musal should be without a British Vice-Consul at the present moment. 9 . On the top of these disturbances have come others of a more specific charac ter arising from the vendetta of the Chiefs of the Harkiyahf against the Shaikh of Baraizan. These turbulent characters tSee Summary for July, 1—8. ^ to pl un( } ere( l an( l burned three villages in the vicinity of ’Amadiyah, and to be demanding money from others, as the price of sparing them. Villages are stated to have been destroyed in the district of ’Aqrah also. There is comiderable alarm among rural Christians on account of these events, and numbers of Christian families are flocking into Musal town. The head of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission at Bibaidi near ’Ama diyah having expressed uneasiness, representations were made by the British Dragoman to the Musal Wilayat, and about 40 mounted gendarmes were sent to ’Amadiyah to preserve order there. A gendarmerie detachment was sent to ’Aqrah also. This was about the middle of October; and a little later the Harkiyah came into conflict with the ’Ashair Sab’ah tribes in their habitat between Musal and ’Aqrah and a party of 40 regular cavalry was despatched from Musal to the spot. 10 Though there cannot be said to be anything even faintly resembling a. general Arab movement in this province, a certain number of Arab “ nationalists do exist in Mesopotamia, and their activity, even m Baghdad, is not impercepti ble. Basrah still takes the lead of Baghdad in such matters, and Saiyid Talib t is still high-priest of the new political creed. JSee last Summary, 1—18. early in October informed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah that another plot by the Committee of Union and Progress against his life had been discovered and foiled, and that about the middle of the month fresh demands for decentralisation would be submitted simul taneously by telegram to the Central Government from all the Arab Wilayats in the Empire. * . # x At Baghdad manifestoes in favour of decentralisation and reform have been arriving by the Turkish post from Aleppo, but the actual place from which they originate seem to be unknown. Another native newspaper^ entitled the An- Nahdha ” or “ The Up-Rising,” began to be published at Baghdad in the first week of October ; its proprietor is Muzahim-al-Amin, a member of the influential Pacha jizadah family; and its tone is decidedly anti-Committee of l nion an progress. On the 16th October, the First Dragoman of this Residency found on hisoffice table a small envelope, containing a slip of paper on which was printed in Arabic : “If you would know the desire of the Arabs you can enquire of ’Abdur Rahman * Haidari the Naqib Effendi, f Yusuf Effendi, J Suwaidizadah, the Pachaji- zadah family and ” (three other less dis tinguished names followed). Mr. Nersessian was unable to discover how the envelope had been conveyed into his office room. *See last Summary, I—19. fSaiyid ’Abdur Rahman, the Naqib of Bagh dad, who is no doubt a true Arab at heart and dislikes the Turks. JSee last Summary, I—19. At Karbala, lately, letters from unknown correspondents were delivered to notables of the town ; they contained denunciations of the present Government of Turkey. The names given by the writers (“ Saiyid Khalaf, ” “ Saiyid Muham mad, ” etc.), were perhaps fictitious ; and it was noticed that all the letters were sealed with seals dated as cut in the present year. No action has been taken by‘the Turkish authorities, except at Baghdad, where the following persons have been called on to appear before the Mustantiq or Examining Magistrate, apparently on some vague charge of causing unrest:— (1) Muzahim Effendi, § Pachajizadah ; ( 2 ) Yusuf Effendi, [[ Suwaidizadah ; §The proprietor of the “Nahdha,“ already ( 3 ) Bey Acting Chief of the mentioned.

The Wali, I under stand, has recommended that the case be not further proceeded with ; but it is said that his objections, which were founded on politi cal expediency, have been overruled from Constantinople. 11 . At Baghdad, this time, it is the unexpected** which has occurred. All the civil and military servants of the Gov- ** See Summary for August, 1—15. ernment have received their pay in full to the end of the last Turkish month, that is to the 14th October. AtMusal, so far as is known, no progress has been made in discharging the arrears due to Government servants and dejection as yet prevails in official circles. The civil employes and pensioners of the Musal Wilayat telegraphed to Constantinople, asking for their stipends ; but the only reply was that £T.20,000 must be remitted to Constantinople every month, after which civil charges might be met from the remainder. In answer the Acting Wali asserted that £T.20,000 could not be collected from the whole Wilayat, even by the end of the year, and suggested that the question might be thrashed out with his successor. 12. The following elections to the Generalff Council of the Baghdad Wi’ayat were announced after those mentioned last month:— tfSee last Summary, I—19. Hillah. 28. Amin Effendizadah Rauf Effendi (apparently the same as for Shamiyah.) 29. Khurshid Effendi. Kut. 30. Saiyid Jasim Effendi. Samawah. 31. Shaikh Muhammad Ash-Shaikh Tahir Effendi.5 The first meeting of the new Council was held at Baghdad in the hall of the Sarai on the 14th October, and there have been several other meetings since. The only report on the first meeting, which I have received, states that “nothing but dis putes on nonsense took place,” and the later ones produced no noteworthy incident, so it may be inferred that this new assembly, though containing the elect of the people, will be of the same subservient character, as others to which Baghdad is accustomed. I understand that Yusuf Effendi, Suwaidizadah, persists in his resolution* not to belong to the Council. more *See last Summary, I—19. 13.

The Shaikh of Kuwait is said to have recently purchased new date gardens at Faddaghiyah on the right or Turkish bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab above Fao. 15. Various military movements are reported from the Musal Wilayat. By the end of September, the 2nd battalion of the 105th Regiment, mustering 157 rifles, had left Musal for Rawanduz. At the beginning of October, the 1st battalion of the 108th Regiment, lately on tSee last Summary, 1—22. 5. e ^t at Tall ’Afar, was transferred from Musal to Kirkuk. The four officers lately cashiered from it had brought a case or action of some sort against Major Fahmi Effendi, the Commandant, which was to be tried by the Staff; and all five were, consequently, detained at Musal. In the second week of October, the 1st battalion of the 105th Regiment, which § See last Summary, 1—22. W&amp;S ex P ec t e d§ to be sent to Rowanduz, went to Aqrah instead, where it relieved the 3rd battalion of the 103rd Regiment. The last mentioned battalion, which left Musal 170 strong, returned with only 120 men; the difference is said to be account ed for by desertions. On the 26th October, Grafts carrying ammunition and powder in barrels arrived from Diyarbakr at Musal, under a military guard of 70 men. At the end of September, the independent Frontier Companies attached to the Musal Army Corps, were distributed as below:— Station. Margawar Saidagan Rayat Sardasht Baneh Khurmah (Hazmah ?)

II.—British Interests and Cases. 1 .

P ieces manufactured on the spot, a day or . , ! , , two before my arrival the partition divid ing the new channel from the present Euphrates was cut through, and part of the river allowed to take its course through the Barrage. The structure, as it stands now, though the sluices are still raised, has an excellent appearance; and its mean ing must at last be obvious even to the most obtuse. Native criticism by the way gradually died away as the work progressed towards completion. It now only remains to close altogether the present channel of the river an operation, which, it is calculated, will require about three weeks more: and, mean while, the remains of the earth barriers, separating the new from the present bed both above and below the Barrage are being dug, and washed away by the combined efforts of workmen and stream. When these arrangements are finished the whole Euphrates will pass through the 36 arches of the Barrage, and then on the sluices in the same being lowered, the river will be ponded up, and as much of it as is required can be turned into the “ Hillah Branch ”, cultivation on which has been languishing for some ten years for want of water. I did not gather on the spot that any opening ceremony will be held. The most spectacular part of the work was the admission of the water to the new channpl and this has already taken place. cnannei, 2. The important question is f ‘ What will happen when the Hindiyah Barrage is finished ?” Will the Turkish Government have the energy, and intelligence to proceed at once with the second work of the Willcocks’ programme the Habbaniyah Escape, of which the object is to relieve the Euphrates in spring rises and avert destructive floods ? And, if they have the will, do they possess the means ? Sir A\ illiam Y\ illcocks’ estimatef of the cost fSeo his “ irrigation of Mesopotamia”, ion, of the new Hindiyah Barrage was pa8 ° s 110 * 111 ' 334,740—50,000 = £T. 284,740; audit would be interesting to know what the actual cost has been, whether more or less. His estimate J for the Habbaniyah t Ibid, page 112 . Escape was £ T. 395,500. The former work has been completed, not without a thousand difficulties, during a period in which at first the financial credit of Turkey was good ; the latter, considerably more expensive, and not so obviously a paying enterprise,' falls to be undertaken, when Turkey has been “ bled white”, and has little to offer even as security for loans ; also it is to be feared that military and naval preoccupa tions, and ruinous sacrifices to prestige, such as the retention of Adrianople, will claim the bulk of such fund, as can be made available. Even so, however it should not be impossible for Turkey to provide £T. 400,000 in the course of say three years to admit of the carrying out of the Habbaniyah work by degrees. The Wali of Baghdad lately told me that he had proposed to his Government that the tithes of Diwaniyah should be offered to Sir John Jackson, Ltd., as security for such expenditure as the firm might incur in carrying out the Habbaniyah project. I understand, however, that Jalal Bey is generally snubbed, or at least his sugges tions are frequently ignored, at Constantinople, which is a pity, for he is an earnest and well-meaning, if not a brilliant, official. I cannot pretend to say whether, in the present case, it is probable that the tithes of Diwaniyah, either at the present rate, or on the scale to which they may rise after the completion of the Hindiyah Barrage, would be sufficient security for the principal and interest of £T. 400,000 ; and in any case it seems pertinent to enquire why local security, the most danger ous of all to Turkey, should be the security offered. Here I may be allowed, perhaps, to place on record my conviction, that, if Turkey should be persuaded into borrowing money for Mesopotamian irrigation on the security of the irrigation works themselves, or of the lands depending on them, or of both, she will find herself edged out sooner or later, both from the control, and from the profits of the enterprise. If I have correctly understood the policy of His Majesty’s Government they do not wish to see what should be the Porte’s■■ fttggsgggr. ^ 37 7 own share of the proceeds of agriculture in Mesopotamia a future great potential stand-by of the Turkish budget—go permanently into the pockets of foreign specula tors, even if those pockets should be British; but they would like British contractors to make fair profits on the construction of the works, and British experts to be engaged afterwards for canal management, agricultural 'colonisation, and the adjust ment of land tenures, taxes, water-rates and dues. The line of action to be recom mended to Turkey, in that case, would be to keep a free hand in the matter, and set aside a moderate but assured sum in the annual budget for carrying on the A\ illcocks’ programme, providing it either from general revenues or by loan on such security, as will give the lenders no power to foreclose on the lands or waters of Mesopotamia. 3. On the 9th October, Mr. John Baird, M.P., private Secretary to Mr. Bonar Law, the leader of the Opposition, reached Baghdad from Aleppo on a rapid tour through Turkey and Persia. Some words, which he once spoke in Parliament, hav ing established for him in Turkey a reputation as a Turkophil, the Constantinople Government took steps to facilitate his journey, so that everywhere he was received with marks of appreciation and respect, and was treated as a public guest. At Baghdad he was to have been quartered on the Mayor of the Municipality, who, in fact, had prepared a suite of rooms for him in his own house; but this Residency had also been instructed to assit Mr. Baird, and rather to his relief, I was able to make my invitation prevail. It would have had an unfortunate effect, if a British politi cian reputed an especial friend to Turkey had appeared to avoid the British Residency, which is the invariable pied d terre at Baghdad of British travellers of any position. On the 10th October, I showed Mr. Baird most of Baghdad town. On the morning of the 11 th, we visited the Baghdad Railway works together, and were heartily welcomed, and shown round by the heads of departments. Later the same day Meissner pasha called on Mr. Baird at the Residency, and had a long conver sation with him. In the evening Mr. Baird left for Basrah, with Mr. Tod, Messrs. Lynch's Baghdad Manager, on board the tug “ Shirin ” of the “ Transports Fluvi- aux”. During his short saty at Baghdad, Mr. Baird exchanged visits with the Wali, etc. Mr. Baird formerly belonged to the diplomatic service. He served at Vienna and in Egypt and Abyssinia, and since his retirement, he has travelled widely in other parts of the world. He speaks German and Arabic, as well as French; and his tact and accomplishments, together with his experience of men and knowledge of the East, have given Baghdad an idea, perhaps, too favourable of what the .!’ British House of Commons must be. Mr. Baird s intentions, when he left Baghdad, were to visit Bushehr in the Persian Gulf, and then travel from Muhammareh and Ahwaz, via the Bakhtiyarx Road to Isfahan, and so by Tehran home, where he was due to arrive before the end of November. 4. Lieutenant H. W. Young, of the 116th Mahrattas, arrived at Musal from Diyarbakr on the 18th October, on his way to rejoin his regiment in India, after a tour through European and Asiatic Turkey. He arrived at Baghdad on the 25th, and left again for Basrah on the 29th. I was sorry to be absent on tour when he passed through, as his father, Sir Mackworth Young, was one of the Lieutenant- Governors, under whom I had the honour of serving in the Punjab; but he found accommodation, and a welcome in the Residency. 5. At the beginning of October, Mr. J. A. Ramage, a Scoto-American, the chief representative in India of Messrs. Singer, the sewing-machine manufacturers, visited Baghdad on business. He intends to open several Singer shops at Baghdad where there is already one, and other places in Turkish Iraq. He estimates that the Persian Gulf region might take 10,000 machines a year, if the business were properly pushed. Mr, Ramage explained that Messrs. Singer have large works in Scotland, as well as in America, and that all the Singer machines sold in India, and the countries adjoining, are Glasgow-made. Messrs. Singer’s business in this part of the world may, therefore, be considered as a British interest.6. British tailors seem unable either to leave Baghdad alone or definitely to enter on business there. This month a Mr. Bover has visited Baghdad on.behalf of •See last Summary, n -3. Messrs Asquith and Lord of Bombay, and has sold goods there as Messrs. Hoar* and Co’s, representative did last month. The latter, I am glad to say, made a satisfac- tcry settlement with the Customs authorities before he went away. He does not seem to have been much to blame for non-payment of duty in the first instance, as he went ashore openly with his boxes from the steamer, without being accosted by any Customs official. 7. I regret to say that a serious robbery was committed on the night of the 28th-29th October in a tent occupied by Mr. Rosario, the Head Clerk of this Resi dency, at Qararah—a suburb of Baghdad, where some families camp in autumn for change of air. Almost the whole wearing apparel of Mr. Rosario and his family, to the value of about £T. 30, was carried off by thieves, while they slept; and some' of them had to return to towm the next morning in their night attire. The night watchmen are suspected, and police proceedings are in progress. 8 . On the 10 th October, Dr. Stanley, the Church Missionary Society’s medical representative at Musal, left that place for Mardin. The object of his journey has not been reported, but the local authorities supplied him with an escort on account of the dangerous state of the roads. On the 24th October, Miss Martin, the Manager of the Girls’ School in connection with the same Mission, started for Bagh dad, travelling via Kirkuk. She also was given an escort by the local government. III. —British Indian interests and cases. 1 . While at Karbala, I visited the dykes, a few miles distant, on which the protection of the town, and its environs against floods depends. I found that they had been destroyed as usual, except the innermost, by inundations from the Hindiyah, and that, unless more rational measures are to be adopted at last, it will be necessary to reconstruct them next year at great expense, for this time they have been ruined throughout almost their whole length. There have been attempts-)* +q q f v. a ■. in,o ^ « to inclu&lt; I e British subjects in the forced contributions by which these dykes are main tained ; and a legal suit connected with the question is still unsettled in a Turkish Court at Karbala. I have been in correspondence on the subject with His Britan nic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, to whom I shall now make a further report. 2 . The principles on which the British Indian School at Karbala is being con ducted do not seem so sound as those, which were'followed:): last year. As the Com- ISee Summary for March-April 1912, V-7. “f- Sti11 n ?gotiating§ SSee Summary for September 1912, III-3. ^ ‘^Turkish authorities in the^ Educa- tional Department for permission to establish the school on a legal basis, I thought it better not to cause excitement, or give the school an officially British appearance by visiting it this time. The attendance has grown, I understand, to over 150 ; but a large number of the pupils are neither Indians nor British subjects, and the chief ambition of the managers now seems to be to make theirs the largest and most reputed school in Karbala. With this purpose, a spacious building has been rented, salaries of teachers have been increased, and school festivities and entertainments have become frequent j still instruction is given to all pupils gratis, even when their parents are in a posi tion to pay fees. At the time of my arrival at Karbala, the school was, consequently, £T. 66 in debt, and it was obvious that the managers were looking to the Oudh Bequest not only to extricate them from their immediate difficulties, but also to give them a handsome subsidy for the future. I set my face against these measures, as demoralising to the school itself, and as an abuse of the Oudh Bequest, and in the end the debts of the school were wiped out by voluntary subscription, all but about £T. 12 . The Karbala Committee ‘of the Oudh Bequest then paid off the small balance of the debt, and granted the school a subsidy of £ T. 48 for the following six months, on the understanding that the managers of the school should try to bring it into a better financial conditionbefore the end of the period, and that they would not expect thereafter more than very modest assistance from the Ouh Bequest. No proper arrangements have yet been made for an English teacher, but until the position of the school has been made secure by its obtaining a license from the Turkish Educational Department, it would be waste of time and energy to take any steps for its better organisation. IV. — British Official Matters. 1 . In May last, a dog belonging to Mr. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant in this Residency, went mad and bit various persons. Two or three months later one of these, a servant, died of hydrophobia ; and the old and cqmfortable belief that rabies did not exist at Baghdad was destroyed. Another of the persons, who had been bitten, then went to the Pasteur Institute at Kasauli in India, where he was found to be infected with the hydrophobic virus, but was successfully treated. On his return to Baghdad he brought a recommendation that Mr. Gaskin also should visit Kasauli, and be treated, as it was uncertain whether he had been slightly bitten or not. Mr. Gaskin accordingly left Baghdad for India on the 4th October. His departure threw upon the Resident the work of Treasury Officer in addition to his own. 2 . To meet the growing requirements of the British Post Office at Baghdad two large and convenient rooms have now been allotted to it instead oi Dne, the number of windows for operations has been increased, and other conveniences have been provided. One advantage of the new arrangement is that it gives separate rooms for letter and parcels work, and that the visiting representative of the Turkish Customs need not be admitted, except to the latter of these. The old Post Office is being converted into a ward in connection with the Residency Dispensary to which it is contiguous. 3 . The Residency Dispensary has, at the same time, been placed on a more regular footing than hitherto. Stock has been taken; the dispensary rooms have been refitted and improved ; and a register of cases treated gratuitously has been instituted. An abstract from this record, prepared by Major Scott, the Residency Surgeon, is attached to show the charitable work done in the Dispensary during September and October (Annexure A). 4 . The accounts of the free distribution of bread made by the Oudh Bequest Committees at Karbala and Najaf during Ramadhan have been made up. They show that 345 persons at Karbala and 379 persons at Najaf were given free bread tickets for that month. The dependents of the ticket-holders brought the number of individuals benefited at each place up to 697 and 640, respectively, or to 1,337 in all. 5 . The following are the stages of the official tour, which I made to Karbala and Najaf during the month, and to which more than one reference has already been made above :— 14th October .. Baghdad to Sikandariyah. 15th .. Sikandariyah to Karbala. 16th-21st .. Halt at Karbala. 22nd 5J .. Karbala to Khan Hamad. 23rd 99 .. Khan Hamad to Najaf. 24th-27th 99 .. Halt at Najaf. 28th 99 .. Najaf to Hillah. 29th 99 .. Hillah to Hindiyah Barrage. 30th 99 .. Hindiyah Barrage to Baghdad. Between Sikandariyah and Karbala, after passing Musaiyib, I diverged a little to the north of the ordinary route, for the purpose of seeing the encampments of the great ’Anizah Bedouin tribe, which for a month or two in the late summer and autumn cover this part of the country ; but all but a few had lately moved away, and the only man of any note that I found was a cousin of the Shaikh Dighaiyim, presiding over one small camp. OjOoFDAt Karbala I was mostly occupied with Oudh Bequest appointments and distribution of money under the Bequest; but I also, as already mentioned, visited the Karbala dykes, and went into the affairs of the Indian school. • On the way from Karbala to Najaf Nawab Sajjad 'Ali Khan, the head of the Indian community at Baghdad, who had come with me to assist me with his advice in various matters, was taken suddenly ill, and could not finish the journey on horse-back. At first I feared it might be an attack of heart disease, but he rallied, and a place was found for him in a passing carriage. After a day or two's rest at Najaf he was well again. At Najaf, as at Karbala, the work consisted chiefly in making new appoint ments, and superintending the distribution of money ; but I also renewed acquaintance with Saiyid Jawwad, the Kiliddar, who is one of the richest and most important notables in Turkish Arabia, and with various members of his family. Some of the Kiliddarzadahs I saw at their town house, and some of them at their country estate of Tajiyah, where I lived the last fiime I was at Najaf; on this occasion, for quicker despatch of business, I had a house in town. At the house of Abul Qasim, the Russian Consular Agent at Najaf, I met accidentally with Shaikh 'Atyah, formerly a celebrated Arab outlaw, but now a person of consideration in the place. On one occasion, with only 15 men, he held out for a whole day in his fort in the desert, some 20 miles from Najaf, against a Turkish force with artillery ; and then slipped cleverly away in the night with his family and followers, leaving a deceptive watch-fire burning. At one time he took refuge at Kirmanshah in Persia, and attempted to become a Persian subject. When Nazim Pasha ruled at Baghdad, he cast himself on the clemency of that straightforward old soldier, in whom perhaps he discerned a spirit kindred to his own, and obtained through him a pardon from the Government. He gave me an interesting account of his first interview with Nazim Pasha, to whom he presented himself unexpectedly, and by whom he was at first in some danger of being misunderstood, through the Pasha’s ignorance of Arabic. Shaikh ’Atiyah, now in middle life, is spare, fairly tall, athletic, and open-faced ; and, if only the Turks knew how to employ such material, he would be useful to them. 6 . The following is a synopsis of the result of the Oudh Bequest distributions at Karbala and Najaf:— Karbala. Classes and numbers of persons paid. Amount paid (in £ T.).

Under the system, which was abolished with the sanction of the Government of India in 1912, the amounts publicly distributed would have gone into their private pockets in addition to these large sums, and the poor would have benefited little or not at all. All the Oudh Bequest arrears in the Baghdad Treasury have been disbursed, and all the vacancies among Distributors and Residency Members of Committee have been filled up, and my successor in Baghdad, who is expected soon, will take charge of the Bequest as a going concern. I intend to report on the present position of the Bequest, before leaving Baghdad, if possible. 7. On my tour, I enquired on the spot into various charges brought against and by Maulvi Saiyid Ahmad, the Indian Distributor, who has occasioned * much • See bet Summery, IV-8. ** In . a 1 dis P ut « between him and Shaikh Mahmud Agha, another Naiaf Distributor, a reconciliation was arranged by Nawab Sajjad 'Ali Khan ; I did not enquire the terms, but from the attitude of the two men to each other after wards it seemed to me that the Maulvi must have apologised to his colleague. A letter, which the Maulvi wrote me secretly, containing serious reflections not only on some of the members of the Karbala Committee, but also on the Vice-Consul, Mr. Muhammad Hasan Muhsin, is still under enquiry. 8. By the death f of Saiyid Muhammad Baqir, Tabatabayi, the adminis- tSee Summary for June 1913, IV—io. tration of a fund, chiefly charitable, known as tne Zandiyah Bequest, became vacant. Its amount is Rs. 2,400 a year. As the terms of the Bequest are not perfectly clear from the documents constituting it, I am referring certain points to the Government of India for authoritative decision before a fresh appointment is made. / 9. From Shaikh 'Atiyah at Najaf, who must be considered a good authority + o , q TV r in such matt ers&gt; I learned that the story t oi Shaikh Ajaimi s having recovered the goods plundered by Dhafir near 'Anah was pure nonsense. The Dhafir were relieved of their ill-gotten gains, but it was by the Mutair, another desert Bedouin tribe ; and the goods in question have all been dispersed, and sold below their value long ago. There is, therefore, clearly no chance of Mr. 'Abdeni’s getting back his two bales. 10. I have lately been informed of my own approaching transfer from the Baghdad Residency to that of the Persian Gulf, where I am to relieve Sir Percy Cox about the beginning of December. My successor here will be Lieutenant- Colonel Keith David Erskine, C.I.E., at present Political Agent, Eastern Raj.- putana States, India. He is expected to arrive at Basrah on the 13th of November. It is remarked here that my appointment to Bushehr somewhat resembles that of my late Baghdad colleague Mr. Orloff, to Tabriz, the two places being, after Tehran, the chief seats of British and Russian influence, respectively, in Persia.

Commer cial caravans have been unmolested of late ; but towards the end of September a pilgrim caravan was looted by Guran on the Baghdad-Kirmanshah road,12 between Kirind and Harunabad, and 175 mules belonging to it, said to be owned in Baghdad and Musal, were carried off.

Germany, and will not return here. The German Consul thus remains for the present without a European Assistant. 2 . Large quantities of material for the Baghdad Railway have been arriving for some time, including full-sized locomotives. Single articles weighing as much as 19 tons have had to be hoisted out of the “ Transports Fluviaux ” barges at the Railway wharf. The Railway Station is beginning to take shape at some distance inland of the town on the west side of the river. The ground is low, and dykes are not being relied on to protect the site from floods ; in stead earth is being piled on it, so as to raise its level about two metres above the plain. The cubic quantity of matter to be moved will be enormous ; for the station, sidings, goods warehouses, etc., will cover a large area ; but there are steam excavators to dig the earth required at a distance, and light railways to bring it in, and distribute it over the site. Meissner Pasha hopes that the line will be open from Baghdad to Samarra by September 1914. On the 9th and 10 th of October, there was a strike of the Arab labourers on the Railway works at Baghdad. The 10 th happened to be the day of Mr. Baird’s and my visit, so that we were witnesses of part of the proceedings. Meissner Pasha was on the spot himself, and seemed to have the negotiations in his own hands, thereby confirming a former impression of mine that his assistants here are all nonentities, and that they are perhaps chosen by him for that very reason. He is evidently a man very jealous of his own authority and reputation. In the end the cause of the strike, whatever it was, was overcome, but not, I think, until the influence, and even the personal presence of the x Naqib of Baghdad had been invoked, and obtained by Meissner Pasha, for they landed together from a motor-boat in the evening. It is difficult to imagine the director of a British enterprise appealing to such a personage as the Naqib for help in a difficulty with his workmen. Meissner Pasha has very decidedly aged since he began work in Mesopotamia. His hair has now turned quite white. It is impossible to avoid comparing his case with that of Sir William Willcocks, and concluding that work under the Turkish Government in such a country of obstruction, annoyance and insult, both acci dental and intentional, as Mesopotamia ought not to be undertaken by men of established reputation, who have passed middle life. 3. When Mr. Baird, M. P., was here, I promoted a meeting between him, Mr. Cree (of Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company) and Mr. Tod (of Messrs. Lynch and Company). In the conversation which followed I was glad to hear Mr. Cree admit that the agricultural produce of the country from Baghdad southwards would be carried by rail to the Persian Gulf, if a Baghdad-Basrah Railway were built, and not by the Baghdad Railway to Alexandretta. Mr. Cree has always l been a great partisan of railway connection with the Mediterranean, though he would have had it more direct than the Germans are going to make it; and, as he is also a very clear-headed man of business, it is encouraging to believers in the Persian Gulf route to find that he now thinks the bulk of the exportable products of the country—for that is what it comes to—will go to Europe by the Persian Gulf. 4. Two poor German subjects, who had been robbed just outside Musal of their passports, clothes, and some money,—such at least was the account they gave of themselves,—came to the Dragoman in charge of the German Vice-Consulate there for assistance on the 4th October. 5. At the beginning of October, a German commercial traveller, said to have come from Mardin and Diyarbakr, spent five days at Musal, and then proceeded in the direction of Baghdad. This was his third visit to Musal.( 4 ? u 6 . Mr. Loiko,* who came to Baghdad to relieve Mr. Popoff, has returned to 4C1 , x 0 ,rr c • Bushehr, where no doubt I shall shortly see nim again. 7.

The 2 nd of September was Bairam, and released pious Muhammadans of Mesopotamia from the tortures of Ramadhan.* *See last Summary, I—1. 2 . The birthday of His Majesty the Sultan of Turkey was celebrated at Bagh dad on the 22 nd September ; there was some doubt up to the last regarding the day upon wdiich it would hill. The Wall’s reception at the Sarai in the morning was short and informal; and at night Turkish public buildings were not illuminated. It had been intended to illuminate the British Residency on this, the firstf suitable occasion that had occurred for some time, but the abstention of the Turkish autho rities from illuminations caused the idea tSeo Summary for June, IV-2. t() be g j veI1 up&gt; 3.

([Possibly the uncle, whose name was not given in the P. S. to Summary for March. 4. On the 6 th September, another column, consisting of the 1 st Battalion of the 108th Regiment, and two mountain guns, which had recently been brought in 9 from Rowanduz was despatched from Musal to coerce Tall ’Afar, a refractory place,^ inhabited by Turkomans lying on the road from Musal to Sinjar, where there has long§ been difficulty about conscription s j u j' » f or jmiitary service. Alter its arrival some notables of Tall ’Afar, including Yasin Effendi and I)awud Agha, were arrested, and sent to Musal, where they were imprisoned. In all 57 military deserters were captured anR will be sent to serve at Basrah, from which place it wall be more diffi cult for them to desert than from Musal. It is understood that there are still some hundreds of men liable to military service at Tall ’Afar, on whom it has not been possible to lay hands. The column was back at Musal before the 22 nd September. 5. After the middle of the month a serious fire occurred in the Ras-al-Maidan quarter of Musal town. The resulting damage is estimated at £ T. 20,000. 6. Letters from ’Amarah say that bloody fighting has taken place near ’Ali- al-Gharbi between Ghadhban, Shaikh of the Bani Lam, and Fahad, one of his rela tions. [| The cause was the standing dispute about lands leased from the Turkish Government. A considerable number of tribesmen are said to have been killed on both sides. The Mutasarrif of ’Amarah, Sirri Bey, a Turk, hired Agha Ja’far’s new Tigris steamer, the “ Muzaffari,” and would forthwith have proceeded against Ghadhban with an insufficient force, but the Wali of Basrah forbade him to move. 7. ’Ajaimi, the Shaikh of the Muntafik, and Salim-al-Khaiyun, Shaikh of the Bani Sa’ad, whose connection^ with recent events at Basrah will be remem- USee Summary for July, I— i. bered, lately sent the Union and Progress newspaper “ Zuhur at Baghdad, for public ation, a telegram, which they had addressed to the people of Basrah. The tele gram condemned the behaviour of the Basrahites in giving ear to mischief-makers (Saiyid Talib and his friends), and called on them to show a proper appreciation of all that the Turkish Government were doing to satisfy Arab aspirations. 8 . Affairs atSamawah** seem to be going from bad to worse. I am informed ££ q i o TO t ^ lat on the 27 th September a telegram was ** See last Summary, I—8. • i - i i i i • i received at Baghdad which caused a great stir in the Sarai, followed by hasty deliberations among the military authorities^ The bad news that came is believed to be to the effect that the Turkish troops at Samawah have met with a disaster, that the town is besieged, and that telegraphic 0 452F.D ■ &amp; rcommunication with it is cut. According to the latest information received to-day (30th September) a force of 210 infantry, made up of drafts from various batta lions, will march for Samawah to-night. Baghdad will thus be left with very few troops, and it is thought that the Radif may shortly have to be called out. The Zaiyad, Budur, and ’Ajib, which are allied to the Muntafik tribe, are stated to be the tribes principally in rebellion. 9. The road from Baghdad to Samarrah, ordinarily safe, is now insecure and Nawab Sajjad ’Ali Khan, the head of the Indian community here, tells me that he would not venture to travel by it with his family, in present circumstances. During the month, an ex-Qaim-Maqam of Kadhimain, and an engineer or con tractor connected with the Baghdad Railway, who were travelling between Bagh dad and Samarrah, were robbed ; it is said that the offence has been traced to Mujamma ’Arabs, and that arrests have been made. Some, however, suspect that the Dilaim of the Euphrates valley are responsible for the insecurity that has arisen. 10 . A robbery of pilgrims bound for Makk.ah on the road from Baghdad to' Fallujah is also reported. If disorder continues to extend, and approach nearer to Baghdad as it has 11 .

A mass of other official changes have taken place in the Baghdad W ilayat within a very short time. ° J The departure of Lutfi Bey, the Assistant B ali, was mentioned last month by anticipation ; it took place, apparently, on the 1 st September. No application has been made by the Wall that this place should be filled-one reason beinv it is said, that the exceptional post of Muawm was only created to facilitate matters or Aazim Pasha, who commanded the troops, besides being civil governor, and that it attention were drawn to its existence now, it would probably be suppressed. Mustafa Nadir Bey, a member of the Committee of Union and Progress, and ||3ee Summary for June, I — i. Maktubji since a considerable time of the M , oc , • n'i r A , r , -I w Baghdad v ilayat, has been appointed to the Mutasarnflik of Muntafik, left vacant by the assassination!! of Bad’iNuri Bey. Sim Bey, a Turk and presumably a member of the Committee, has been trans- fenedfiom Amarah to Karbala, as Mutasamf. The relieved Mutasarrif, Rashid Pasha, a native ot Sulaimamyah in this province, is said to have been dismissed for incompetence. The post of Daftardar at Baghdad, lately vacated by a Union and Progress incumbent on transfer or promotion elsewhere, is now filled by Ahmad Fahim Bey ex-Daitardar ot i amna. J ’ _ S ®P ten ; ber ’ Q udrat Bey, Director of Foreign Affairs, in other words the Wah s political secretary, called unexpectedly to bid me good-bye ; he said that he had suddenly obtained leave of absence, and was starting the next day b.i Constantinople. He also belongs to the Union and Progress party, but during the past year his opinions were not obtruded on foreign representatives as formerly though he still showed himself obstructive, as occasion offered. 3With the departure of Lutfi Bey and Qudrat Bey, who I much suspect will not return, the position of the Wall of Baghdad is reduced to what it was before the arrival of Nazim Pasha in Iraq. 14. Financial difficulties are thickening. At Baghdad the civil officials * duly ♦See last Summary, i— 14 . received half a month’s pay at Bairam s,[,, '7 i ”' “•wS zs rs,rrAti£ as at the end of August. At Musal there is no money ; civil salaries are two to three months behind ; all expenditure has been stopped, under orders from Constanti nople, and it is asserted that the proceeds of the agricultural tithes are being handed teTgibk to ^ e e Partment; ° f Public Debt-a statement which at present I not in- t * ^ Baghdad Custom House has this month been considerably strengthened chiefly, the Head Mudir informs me, so as to improve the handling of the transit trade to and from Persia. From another source, I learn that the number of employes added to the staff is about 25, and that it is doubted whether apart from the necessity of providing posts for employes made supernumerary bv territorial losses in Europe, this reform would have now been obtained. 7 V 16.

I am assured by a European at Baghdad who mixes very intimately in JSee Summary for July, i —i. Turkish society of a 1 nion and Progress d i i , knffi that the assertion! that the latp ey was sent to Basrah to make away with Saiyid Talib at the risk of his own life is perfec ly correct.

The demands of the Committee are numer ous, and some of them are of such a radical nature that the Turkish Government i anno! be expected to grant them. The first demands are that ’Iraq shall remain ( ttoman territory under the Crescent, and that foreigners shall be thwarted and excluded from ’Iraq in every possible way; but these are believed to be only a specious gilding of the bitter pills that follow. If the reformers had their way a U real power would be transferred from the Wali, and the Central Government a Constantinople which he represents, to the General Council of the Wilayat.

Shaikh Sa’id Efendi, a teacher in the A’dhamiyah School. 3. ’Abdur Rahman Pasha, Haidarizadah, President of the Municipality. 4. ’Abdullah Salim Effendi, Haidarizadeh.5 The head of the family of Saiyid 'Ali Effendi (No. 23) is known to me to be bitterly* hostile to the Committee; and !^ 2 : II “ 1 - Yusuf Effendi (No. ll) is the Suwaidizadh, w r ho was f recently arrested, under orders from Jamal Bey, Military Governor of Const, ntinople. The latter is said to be making difficulties about taking his seat on the Council, saying that he now prefers private to public life. 20. A new review, written in Turkish, and significantly entitled “ Jihad ” (holy war), has lately made its appearance at Baghdad ; the proprietor and editor is ’Othman Tzzat Bey, a member of the Committee of Union and Progress. In the third number, there was an attack on a politico-educational society or club at Baghdad, recently formed, which is said to have a membership of about 200, and to include Christians, as well as Muhammadans. The “ Jihad ” ironically con gratulates the society on having received considerable subscriptions from the British, French and Russian Consuls—a “ success which no other association in our country could attain So far as the British Residency is concerned the state ment in the review is without foundation ; and it is denied by the Russian represen tative, whom I dissuaded, on his asking my advice, from taking any steps to con tradict it publicly. 21. The agricultural development of Mesopotamia continues to exercise many minds, and it is difficult to say whether the people here are more anxious that steps should be taken towards disposing of the State domains, or more afraid that any such steps by the present Government would be detrimental to the province. On the 10th September, I telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Constantinople, some confidential information, that I had received, according to which an “ Traq^ Concessions ” syndicate has existed in London in embryo for a couple of years. Two of the most conspicuous promoters are Mr. Haskell, a Jewdsh financier, apparently of British nationality, and Mr. Gulbenkian, a financial agent of the Turkish Government in London. The object of the group is to obtain as large a control over irrigation, railways, and navigation in Mesopotamia, as circumstances admit; the capital of the enterprise has been fixed at £ 1,000,000 sterling, of which only half would be paid up in the first instance ; and irrigated or irrigable land would be demanded as security for the outlav. The promoters seem to think that the scheme would have materialised ere now had it not been for the Italian and Balkan wars, and to be still sanguine. The members of the financial group in question have connections with the engineering firm of Paulings ; but they would probably, if they got concessions here, retain the services of Sir John Jackson, Limited, the Hindiyah and Habbaniyah contractors, on account of the local experience now possessed by the latter. I lately received a visi^t from Manahim Salih Daniel, the principal Jewish land- owner in Turkish Arabia, and a little to my surprise I found that he favoured the introduction of a foreign land company, as the best means of setting the province on Ls feet. He knows Mesopotamia too well to cherish any Zionist illusions in regard to it, and I think, therefore, that his attitude is to be explained by a complete indifference to political consequences, such as i . Turk would style lk want of patriotism”. Manahim Effendi has about 400,000 donums of land in the Mun- tafiq Sanjaq alone of which he can make nothing because of the lawlessness and backward state of the district; and his estates about Hillah, not much less extensive, cannot be turned to anything like full account for the same reason. In the circumstances, it w^ould be absurd to expect him to feel any great tenderness for the Ottoman Government. I said to him, as I say to all who speak to me on the subject, that in my opinion the Turkish Government would make a mistake if they were to sell the land belonging to the State in its present undeveloped con dition when it can fetch very little, and that they would do better to keep it in their own hands for a time until, with the help of foreign experts in irrigation and canal-colonisation, it had been at least partially developed. In the latter case local interest would be more fully consulted, and the Turkish Government itself exposed to less unfavourable criticism, than if they entered now into a deal with foreign capitalists. 22. Towards the end of September, the 1st Battalion of the 104th Regiment and 2 mountain guns, which had been sent fromMusalto establish order at Midiat, C.-452F.D.returned to headquarters ; and it was announced that the 1st Battalion of the 105th Regiment would very shortly be despatched from Musal to Rowanduz. Some insubordination occurred among the junior officers of the 1st Battalion of the 108th Regiment while on the Tall 'Afar expedition ; a Captain, r, Lieutenant, and two Second-Lieutenants are said to have been dismissed the service after an en quiry held on the return of the battalion to Musal. The military garrison of the Basrah Sanjaq, in other words the portion of the Basrah Military Division stationed at Basrah itself, and furnishing detachments at tao, Zubair, Safwan and Umm Qasr, is reported by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to have consisted at the beginning of September of the following troops :— 6 Infantry .— Battalion. 38th Nishanji 2nd of 111th Regiment 2nd of 112th Regiment 3rd of 112th Regiment Strength. 194 130 140 166 Total Artillery.- 2 field guns and 2 quick-firing guns and 2 mountain guns and 2 machine guns and 630 Men. 28 25 8 15 Total 76 To these may be added 37 engineers and 8 men of a telegraph company. + , Turkl ^ at Basrah was represented at the same time by the crew of the Marmans 47 in number and 69 marines. J The “ Marmaris ” left Basrah on the 21st August, and returned on the 26th having, in the meantime, it is supposed, conveyed 150 bags of flour to the Turkish garrison in Qatar. II.— British Interests and Cases. 1. The new* Hindiyah Barrage is nearing completion, and the inaugural •See Summary for July, II—I. ceremony is expected to take place in ,,,,,, ,, , 0 vein her at latest. It is said, however, that about two months will be required after that to perfect the structure and everv- thing connected with it. Some of the iron work for the sluices went to’the bottom of the Euphrates on the way up from Basrah, and, though most was recovered a few pieces were lost The unfortunate result, I understand, is likely to be that not all the sluices will be mounted before the inauguration, and that two or three of the openings m the barrage (or possibly in the head of the Hillah diversion) will have to be closed for the occasion by a coffer-dam instead. It is impossible that the barrage can be of use m raising the level of the river to its intended height until the losses of permanent iron work have been made good, for imtil then thl water must be allow ed to now freely through the undammed openings. It is understood that, probably on account of the anxiety of the Turkish Gov ernment to see a revenue-producing work finished at last, Sir John Jackson, Limited have had rather less difficulty about funds during the last three months than at any Timkish. 8 T^smy mg t ^ elr contrac L notwithstanding the depleted condition of the 2 * * 2. There are no signs as yet of any amicablef arrangement between the Anglo- fSee Summary for July, n— 3 . . Persian and the Standard Oil Companies ; and the rumour that an arrangement wasunder discussion is not confirmed. Their brokers in the Baghdad market do not, so far as can be ascertained, consult each other at all about prices or sales. The attitude of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company here is decidedly aggressive, and its American and Russian rivals seem incapable of competing with its low prices. Lately, its opponents, working through native agents, made large purchases from it, evidently with the idea of acquiring temporary control of the market, and rais ing rates sufficiently to clear off their existing stocks without loss ; but Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company had a larger reserve in hand than was supposed, and immediately after the sales lowered their prices still further, so as to penalise the attempt that had been made. One great advantage of the Mahammareh oil is that, having a short journey, and but little handling to undergo, the tins generally arrive with the contents undiminished by leakage—• a fact which the native public are beginning to appreciate. The experiment of sending Anglo-Persian oil to Kirmanshah was unsuccessful, the cost of carriage thither from Baghdad on pack animals disabling it from competition with Russian oils in price. 3. Mr. J. Bryce, representing Messrs. Hoar and Company, a firm of Bombay tailors, has arrived at Baghdad for the third time in four years to take orders for suits, and to dispose of fancy goods and haberdashery. The retirement of Mr. , „ TT _ ♦Holmes from the Baghdad field has left *Soe , umnviry or ay, • an Opening there once more for a British firm, and Mr. Bryce seems inclined to follow Mr. Holmes’ example by leaving his employers in order to take advantage of it. Unfortunately, a complaint has reached me from the Turkish Customs that on the present occasion, as also previously, Mr. Bryce smuggled his stock ashore at Baghdad, without paying duty, a procedure of which the respectable house that he represents would certainly disapprove. I am enquiring into the matter. 4. It appears that the recent talk about finishing the Zabt bridge according tt o to the original design was mere nonsense. tsee last Summary, II-2. U now gaid that tbe upper structure win be of wood. 5. In accordance with a policy, which the Imperial Ottoman Bank seems lately to have adopted of emphasising its British, as well as its French character, Mr. Jones, an Englishman, arrived here at the end of the month to be Controleur or second in charge of the Baghdad branch. For some years there had not been any British employe of the Bank at Baghdad. III.— British Indian interests and cases. Nil IV.— British official matters. 1. The casej of Abu Muhammad was decided by Major Scott, Additional Judge of the Baghdad Provincial Court, sitting jSee Summary for July, IV—5. with two European assessors, on the 7th September 1913. The prisoner was found guilty of obtaining money by false pre tences, and was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment with hard labour. After the sanction of His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to his removal pend ing confirmation of sentence by the Supreme Court at Constantinople had been obtained, Abu Muhammad was despatched to India, under a military guard of four men. The means of detaining prisoners for more than short periods without injury to their health do not exist in this Residency. 2. Through the appointment of a new Postmaster, Mr. Bharucha, a very un satisfactory state of matters in the British Post Office at Baghdad has been brought to light, and I have addressed the Director-General of Posts and Tele graphs, India, on the matter demi-officially. The abuses arise from attempts that are made by almost every mail to import valuable articles through the British letter or sample post and so defraud the Turkish customs ; from the bribes, sometimes large, which are freely offered in con nection therewith ; from the employment of Turkish subjects, not under British jurisdiction on the oost office staff ; and from the irregular admission of outsiders.TurMsh suhjcets, into the office itself. My attention was first seriously drawn to the condition of the office by a complaint that a packet of diamonds, worthTbout ii. 50, winch should not have been allowed to pass at all, had been stolen after delivery before reaching the addressee. Investigation led to the further discoverv .. the postman, an Ottoman Christian, had embezzled about £T. 20 from funds in his charge. It is to be hoped that the Postal Department will take up the matter energe- ^ W ° rk ! hat he has t0 d0 &gt; a,ld vel 7 'imited assistance^ doing it, the Resident here cannot supervise, except distantly, the work of a hrve and growing post office especially if the facts are studiously concealed from him as they were until Mr. Bharucha’s arrival. ’ i • 3; *?n 912, t ^ ie was sa ^ to l° w est for 23 years, and this season’s Th^Rri? 1 !!

The British postal service is disorganised in consequence, the inward mails arriving at Baghdad with great delay, two together, etc., and the outward mails either missing connection at Basrah, or only making it by starting from Baghdad on a dav inconvenient to merchants. From the point of view of the mails, it is possible that Messrs. Lynchs steamer service might be better arranged; but I have not i.thought it necessary to agitate the question in view of the temporary badness of the river, the difficulties in which the ♦See last Summary, ii-3. failure * of the “ Transport Fluviaux ” 4 t&gt; *i i f , tu £ s h as landed Messrs. Lvnch with the Baghdad Railway, and most of all the fact that navigation in Mesopotamia is at present the subject of delicate discussions. 4. In the early morning of the 1st September, jewellery to the value of £T 30 or £T, 40 was stolen from the house of Major Scott, the Residencv Surgeon in the Residency compound. On the morning of the 5th September, during the absence of Mr. Whitley (of Sir John Jackson’s) and his wife at the Hindivah BarrageTt was reported to me that a burglary had taken place at their Baghdad house. In the first case the robbery was traced to a dismissed servant, whom a sepov of the guard had seen near the house, after his dismissal; and the Residencv Native Agent was able, by threatening the man, to induce him to return nearlv evervthimr that he had taken. In the second case, which I investigated personally along with the Turkish police, suspicioin fell on the servants, and chiefly on Mrs. Whitley’s native maid This led to further developments. On information that Mrs. Berrimar, the wife of the present Gunner of the R.I.M.S. “ Comet,” whom he married here, was the sus pected woman’s sister, it was arranged to search Mr. Berriman’s house, as well as a number of others; but, as Mrs. Berriman denied the alleged i elation ship, ro search was made there. Later, it was found that the women were in realitv full sisters, and that Mrs. Berriman had given false information to the authorities (which she afterwards repeated). So far none of Mr. and Mrs. Whitley’s property, worth about £T. 35, has been traced. I have informed the Officer Commanding the “ Comet ” of the facts, and have asked him to report them to the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, as it seems undesirable that a warrant officer of the “ Comet ” should be a man whose wife belongs to a native family in the town. 5. On the evening of the 16th September, an altercation took place at Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company’s cinematograph, between their engineer, Mr. H. Real, who was one of the spectators that evening, and a Turkish officer of Gendarmerie. The incident arose from the officer’s fez having fallen or been thrown to the ground from an empty chair next him on which he had placed it. The officer struck Mr. Real with a cane, which it is said was broken, and used bad language to him. Mr. Real wisely kept his temper, and has now brought a criminal complaint against his assailant in the Turkish courts. Fortunately, there were a number of respectable witnesses of the affair, from whose statements the court should be able to discover the rights and wrongs of the case. On the night of the 21st September, an encounter occurred in the street leading to the cirematograph, between Mr. Lyte, Acting Captain of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s steamer “ Rhalifah,” who was not entirelvaMStfEha 9 Bober, and an Arab watchman, carrying a stick and lantern. The two grappled and fell on the ground together, the Arab uppermost, but were separated by their com panions. The matter is a little obscure, but I understand that another English man, walking ahead of Mr. Lyte, had struck a dog, and that the watchman resented this, and, perhaps, mistook Mr. Lyte for the other Englishman. Very alarming rumours of what was going on having reached the Residency, I went to the town, and was present at a police enquiry, held in Ziyah’s Hotel/till about 2 a.m. The First Dragoman had to remain about a couple of hours longer for the taking of some medical evidince. The Turkish police seemed to realise at last that a moun tain had been made out of a mole-hill; my object in keeping them up all night over the case was that they should. No objection was made to Mr. Lyte’s leaving Baghdad for Basrah with his steamer the next morning, and possibly the matter will blow over. After this there was a great deal of foolish talk about the possibility of general attacks on Englishmen in the street; and on the 23rd September, Qudrat Bey, Director of Foreign Affairs, visited me by order of the Wali to ask whether there was anything that in my opinion should be done to prevent a recurrence of inci dents. I said that I regarded the occurrence of two similar cases within one week as a mere coincidence; that I know there was no great feeling among the English at Baghdad on the subject, and did not believe that there was more among the Arabs ; that both cases were in course of being regularly settled by law ; and that I thought, therefore, discussions might safely be postponed until another case happened. I added that, if the conduct of any British subject was objectionable, I should be glad, bn the Wall’s letting me know, to enquire into the complaints against him, and to speak seriously to the offender, if he were proved to be such ; and I hoped that the Wali would act similarly on any message which I might send him about provocation given by a Turkish subject. 6. Mr. Fontana, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Aleppo, having informed me that two bales, belonging to his Honorary Dragoman, Mr. ’Abdeni, were among the goods looted near ’Anah in August, and having requested me to do anvthing that was possible, I took the matter of their recovery up unofficially. The Wilayat confirmed a very improbable statement, appearing in the local press, to the effect that ’Ajaimi, Shaikh of the Muntafik, had received the stolen goods from the Dhafir, and would return them to the owners on their applying to him ; but Mr. ’Abdeni’s Baghdad agent, who telegraphed to ’Ajaimi, has had no reply. I will see whether His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah can do anything towards obtaining restitution. 7. In the course of the month, on visiting the encampment of a horse-dealer (Jarullah-bin-Talib of Musal) to see the animals, which he had brought to Baghdad this year for exportation to India, I met accidentally withMijwal, one of the senior Shaikhs of the Shammar, a full brother of the Sb.ikh* ’Asi who is now in rebellion. Humaidi, the present officially recognised ♦See last Summary, 1—7. Shaikh of the Shammar, is less popular with the tribe than’Asi and Mijwal, his mother having been a Kurd of Sinjar, while theirs was an Arab. I was introduced to Mijwal, but the moment my back was turned he disappeared, probably not caring to be seen at Baghdad in society scr likely to compromise him with the Turks, as that of the British Resident. 8 9 8. There is reason to fear that Maulvi Saiyid Ahmad, an Indian Mujtahid Distributor from India under the Oudh Bequest, who was selected by my predeces sor, Colonel Ramsay, and recently appointed by me at Najaf after reference to the proper authorities in India, is making considerable trouble in his new surroundings. Though of much less importance personally than some of the other members of the Najaf Oudh Bequest Committee, he is tryng to take the lead among them all, and, I suspect, to work up an Indian clique against Mr. Muhammad Hasan Muhsin, the British Vice-Consul at Karbala, who has very rightly thrown cold water on the Maulvi’s self-advertising activities. 9. Ja’far Bey, late Turkish Consul-General at Bombay, whom I had met at ' the Coronation Darbar at Delhi in 1911, passed through Baghdad lately on his way to Constantinople. While here he paid a flying visit to Karbala. I gathered that knowing no English, he has been deprived of his post in favour of one Khalid10 Bey, formerly (according to him) an Assistant Professor of Turkish at Cambridge. ) Perhaps, the Porte hope that Khalid Bey will prove a more effectual propagandist of their ideas among the Muhammadans of India than Ja’far Bey. The latter told me that he had recommended to his Government the appointment of a Turkish Consul de carriere at Karachi. I invited the Wali, his Political Secretary, Qudrat Bey, and Kamal-ud-Din Bey, Head Mudir of Customs, to dine with me to meet Ja’far Bey, but the invita tion was declined on the ground that Ja’far Bey was leaving for Constantinople the next day. Ja’far Bey had been told that he could travel from Basrah to Aleppo in a few days by making use of the Ottoman motor boat service on the Euphrates ; on arriv ing here he found that there was no such service, and that he would have a very uncomfortable journey of between a fortnight and three weeks in a carriage from Baghdad to Aleppo. 10. Rashid Pasha, the dismissed* Mutasarrif of Karbala, called on me at Bagh dad on the 26th September. The osten- *See 1—13, page 2. sible object of his visit was to enquire whe ther I could find a British purchaser for a plot of land that he wished to sell in his native town of Sulaimaniyah, to which he is now retiring. I explained the im probability of any British subject wishing to buy land in such a place, and suggested that a local purchaser would be more easily found. From our interview, I received the impression that, if incompetence was a real reason of his removal from Karbala, the action of the Government was not unjustified. V.—Persian Affairs. 1. On the 25th August, the Salar-ud-Dauleh*(* was brought into Kirmanshah by a party composed of a Russian officer, tSee last Summary, V— 2. 0 f the Russian Consulate, a representative of the Farman-Farma, and six Russian and fifty Persian Cossacks. He was received into the Russian Consulate on an ambiguous footing, it being by no means clear whether his position there w T as that of a close prisoner, or of a re fugee temporarily under the Russian Consul’s protection. Mr. McDouall, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, who saw the Salar, reports that he seemed unstrung in his nerves. 2. At the end of August, the Farman-Farma if w T as encamped outside the town of Kirmanshah with 1,400 men, but pro- +See bst Summary, V—3. fessed inability to take steps for the re covery of stolen property on the ground that he had no money with which to obtain transport for his force. * 3. The section of the Baghdad-Kirmanshah road in Persian territory § remained safe during the month of August; but §See last Summary, V— i. a p ers i an village near Qal’eh Sabzi, the Persian border post, was looted by brigands from Turkish territory. 4. I understand that my Persian colleague at Baghdad, the Mukarram-us- Sultan, has received from his Government the Order of the Lion and the Sun, of the first class. He has been ill of late, however, and when I last called, I could not see him. VI.— Foreign Interests other than British and Persian. 1 With reference to alleged] | Russian intrigues on the Turko-Persian frontier it has been ascertained that Saiyid Taha II See last Summary, 1—5. jg the son of one Shaikh Sadiq, who again is the son of one Shaikh ’Abdullah, a well-known man in Hakkari. ’Abdul Qadir, another son of Shaikh ’Abdullah, is stated to be a member of the Turkish Senate. Saiyid Taha is said to have left Turkey, and settled in Persia, on account of a dis pute with some of his cousins about the right of managing a Takiyeh (place of re ligious retirement). Some time ago he attacked and burned Margawar, with the head of the Begat tribe at which place, ’Abdullah Bev, he was at enmity. ’Abdullah Bey then called in some of the Harki and Surchi Kurds, supported by whom, hefell upon Taha at Shno (Ushnu); and the latter, with whom there are said to have been a few Russian troops, had to fly to Urumiyah. It was then that, as related last month, 'Abdullah Beg and his associates came to Rowanduz, and sought to obtain a place of refuge in Turkish territory there. 2. A deserter from the Russian army lately came in at Musal; he was said to have been a sergeant in the artillery, and to be a Jew by race. It w r as at first rumoured that he had been received into the Turkish service, but no one w r as allowed to converse with him, and eventually arrangements were made for sending him to Aleppo. 3. Meissner Pasha, Chief Engineer of the Baghdad Railway, arrived * from 4C , 0 . „ , . 7T i Europe by the Euphrates and Tigris Ster.m JNav:g .tion Company s. steamer Blosse Lynch ” on the 11th September, with Madame Meissner. Considerable quantities of railway material, including full-size locomotives, probably ordered long ago, are now .co f xr in i reaching Baghdad from Basrah, and the tsee Summary for May, VI-1. earthwork f of the line from Baghdad to Samarrah is said to be finished ; but I do not think that the masonry bridges and culverts are ready, and I am informed that none of the permanent way has been laid down. There is, therefore, nothing to show that the Railway Company have as yet found a way through the financial obstacles that oppose them. 4. In the same vessel as Meissner Pasha there came to Baghdad a new Italian Consul, Mr. P. Bertanzi. The Italian Consulate here has been for morej than two _ r T 1 ion vtt o years in charge of the Austro-Hungarian ISee Summary for July 1911, VII—9. i r . ° j , 7 Consul who is understood to have received £500 a year for undertaking the duty. 5. Dr. M. Hesse, the Substantive German Consul, returned with his wife in the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamer “ Khalifah ” on the 16th September, after a year’s§ §See Summary for September 1912 , VI—2. leave of absence in Europe, during which his Assistant, Mr. Kalisch, has acted for him. He was a fellow traveller of Sirri Bey, the Mutasarrif!! of 'Amarah transferred to Karbala ; and the Union and Pi ogress ee — ’ pa8e ' local newspaper “ Zuhur relates with gusto a passage of arms that took place between them on the voyage. It seems that Dr. Hesse asked the Mutasarrif whether he was a Turk or an Arab, —a question which it was notfperhaps very tactful to put in public in present circumstances. The Mutasarrif replied that he was unable to give an answer, but that one might be obtained from a Muhammadan ecclesiastic, who was near. The latter, thereupon, said that the Mutasarrif was “ a Muslim '. The paragraph in the “ Zuhur ' was headed “ What do the Foreigners want of Us.' ^ 6. Mr. Loiko, late Acting Russian Consul-General at Bushehr, arrived at „ c „ * vt * Baghdad by the same boat as Dr. Hesse, n See Summary for May, VI-5. ha £ ng | )ee n Sent to relieve Mr. Popofflj of charge of the Russian Consulate-General here with a view to the latter's proceed ing on furlough. The orders were changed, however, apparently in connection with the approaching delimitation of the Turko-Persian frontier ; and it is under stood that Mr. Popofi will remain at Baghdad for the present, and that Mr. Loiko will return to Bushehr very shortly without having taken over charge here. 7. It is said that Mr. Orlofi,** the titulaire of the Russian Consular post at ..Sue Summary for May, vi-5. Baghdad has been selected to fill the Russian Consulate-General at Tabriz m Persia. He is a man of strong common sense, and at Baghdad his line was always one of close communication and hearty co-operation with the British representa tive ; but at Tabriz, possibly, he may find himself in circumstances where such an attitude will not be so easy to preserve as here. 8. The Austro-Hungarian Consul, Mr. Xanthopoulo, is about to leave Baghdad and retire from the service, which he entered in 1870. After his departure, I shall be the consular officer de carriere of longest standing at Baghdad though my stayonly amounts to four years. Mr. Xanthopoulo is a Greek by race, but the head quarters of his family are at Chanaq on the Dardanelles. Perhaps on account of the present state of relations between Greece and Turkey, he is goiner to winter with his family at Athens, whither his mother, who is still alive, is preceding him- but neither he nor his family have seen the Greek capital before. One of Us sons is an engineer in the Baghdad Railway here ; another is a Lieutenant in an Aus- fnd^ecided Regiment. Mr. Xanthopoulo is physically old, but mentally alert VII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. The exportation of horses from Baghdad to India was in full swing during September. 1 He number sent down to Basrah by steamer this year will run to some hundreds, and prices are always rising. It is understood that the prohibition against exporting horses standing more than 1-40 metres (about 13-1) is still in force, but it does not prevent animals above the standard from being sent openlv to Basrah, whence they are smuggled to India, through Muhammareh and otker- . wise I saw a number of the horses brought in, chiefly from the north, this year • and the quality did not stake me as good. As an illustration of the rise in prices’ 1 may mention that I had lately to pay £ T. 80 to mount myself respectably • and 2 animals which I hoped to get for the Residency for about £ T. 65 were bought bv a Musal dealer for £ T. 93, and taken away to India. Polo, racing, and military requirements in that country have made the Arab horse almost as difficult anil expensive to procure at Baghdad as abroad. The Jambaz fraternity seem extra ordinarily sanguine about the prices, which they will realise in India but doubt- less they know their market well, rr J 2 ;, A 3 . 0 H '.

The month of Ramadhan began on the evening of the 4th August, and since then the usual pall of silence and inactivity thrown by the great fast has lain upon the country. At Baghdad, however, there are many Muhammadans, who pay little heed to Ramadhan ; and I notice that among the employes of the British Residency there are several such. When Ramadhan falls, as it has done this year in the hottest of the months, the fast must be painful, and exhausting to those who keep it strictly. Deprivation of food and tobacco for 14 or 15 hours in the 24 may be trying, but it can be nothing in comparison with the difficulty of abstinence from liquids during the same time, the thermometer ranging above 100°, during the greater part of the day, and non-Muhammadans slaking their thirst repeatedly at short intervals. The hardship is greatest to the poor, who have to labour for their daily bread, and so cannot shut themselves up in their houses, and sleep in the daytime, as the rich do. But even the latter are much to be pitied. I hear that my good neighbour, the Naqib of Baghdad, part of whose professional duty it is to show austerity in all religious observances, is so worn out at the close of each day’s fast that he can only swallow water during the first part of the night, and takes what little solid food he can at the meal before dawn. 2. ’Aun Ullah Bey*, late Mutasarrif of * See last Summary, 1—7. Kirkuk, arrived at Baghdad, at the be ginning of the month, and is still here. He was honourably received, and is still entertained by Muhammadf Fazil Pasha, Summary for April-May 1910.1-6, t]le &lt;&lt; Grand 0H Man” of Mesopotamia, and that for June 1913, IV—11. , i i • f • wno was not atraid to make him his guest in spite of his difficulties with the Government. Muhammad Pasha was Wali of Musal during the first part of the time that ’Aun Ullah Bey was Mutasarrif of Kirkuk. I called on Muhammad Pasha and ’Aun Ullah Bey on the 23rd August, chiefly to show that I had not forgotten the latter’s kindness to Mr. Gaskin and myself, on a tour{ to Kirkuk in 1910, and ^summary for Apni-May 1910 , 1—2 and they returned my visit the next day. Poli tical subjects were avoided in our con versations. ’Aun Ullah Bey’s plans seem to be unsettled; he hesitates between returning to Constantinople at once, and settling here for a time. If he should return to Constantinople, I should not be surprised if he were to make himself felt in politics. He talks little, but his 3 years’ government here bears witness to force of character and fearlessness. I cannot conjecture to what party he would attach himself, but I have a feeling that, in spite of his present dismissal, he has not yet broken with the Committee of Union and Progress. 3. Very shortly after the removal of ? Aun Ullah Bey the Wali of Musal, § See last Summary, 1-7. Muharram Bey was dismissed also. It will be remembered§ that the Y\ ah, while he censured the Mutasarrif, supported his request for military assistance; and the punishment of the Wali may be intended to mark the Porte’s strong disap proval of the military operations that were nearly begun. As’ad Pasha, the Commander of the 12th (Musal) Army Corps, was nominated to act as Wali, in addition to his other duties, on the relinquishing of charge by Muharram Bey. He has thus temporarily succeeded an official with w T hom he was on the worst terms, and he will have the opportunity of doing his reputation much injury. 4. It would now seem that the disaster||, which led to these dismissals befell a gendarmerie, and not a military detach- See last Summary I 7, but the number of men ^ &gt; aide-de-camp, W r hom As’ad Pasha sent to Rowanduz has telegraphed -7, but the number of men killed is now given as 13, not 8. C 377 FD2 to him that 30 rifles, some ammunition and some mules belonging to the detach ment, which were lost, have been restored by the Shaikh of Baraizan. This may be so but it does not settle the case or cases against the Shaikh, on account of which the unfortunate detachment was sent to invade his country But evidently the situation is at least not worse than it was, for 120 mounted infantry nave lately been sent back from Rowanduz to Musal. 5. News has been received of tribal fighting at a place, which, from the Musal Dragoman s report, I take to be near the Shinawah pass between Rowanduz and Paswah. the eombatants seem to have been Surchi and Began Kurds on the one side, and the followers of a certain Saiyid Taha on the other ; it is rumoured that there were some Russians with Saiyid Taha. The two tribes mentioned Government^ 6 COme m ^ Rowanc * uz to demand the protection of the Turkish 6. Further information regarding the trouble* in Sinjar is now to hand. * See last Summary i—9. ^ seems that early in July the Qaim-Maqam • tiii i . of Sinjar reported that the Yazidis of the neig bourhood were harassing the townspeople, and the military or gendarmerie detachment there; and that on his representation, a force was despatched a few days biter from Musal to Sinjar. It consisted of a squadron of the 33rd Cavalry 4™“g UnS - the ! St a u d 2 i 1&lt;1 Battalions of 104th Regiment, the 1st Battalion of the 105th Regiment, and a transport tram of 160 mules, in charge of 80 military drivers carrying ammunition and supplies. Nothing has been hefrd so far of the proceedings of this column on reaching Sinjar. 7. There is trouble as usual with and among the Shammar.

It is stated that the Arab tribes about Samawah, Ja’arah, Shamiyah and Diwaniyah have threatened to make common cause, if the Turks attack any of them, and that the authorities are consequently, leaving offenders against the law unmolested, and are abstaining from calling on the tribes to pay Government revenue at present withheld by them. 10. The attack^ on the Government post near ’Anah in July seems to have been See last Summary, i —3. followed by another on a caravan in the . same neighbourhood in August. About the 18th August, some men arrived at Baghdad, and reported that they had been plun dered between^ahiyah and ’Anah, on the Baghdad-Aleppo route, of some 50 mules loaded with silk, the robbers being Dhafir Bedouins. The Wali of Baghdad sent orders to the Mutasarrif of Karbala to intercept the raiders, but there is no hope of these being successfully executed, as the Dhafir are sure to return southwards by the inner high desert. It is considered possible that they may carry the stolen goods to Kuwait for disposal. 11. On the night of the 15th August, Ahmad Bey, Gendarmerie Commandant at Baghdad, was suddenly shot in the street by an Arab, who lodged two revolver bullets m his body. The criminal was arrested, and the Commandant is still alive. Ahmad Bej was a member of the Committee of Union and Brogress, and themmm Baghdad branch of the Committee at once raised a cry that the offence was a political one, like the murder of Farid Bey, and Badi' Nuri Bey at Basrah and should be tried by Court Martial. The fact appears to be that the Commandant had been employed to carry out some orders connected with a land dispute between Arabs in the country; and the Wali of Baghdad has had the good sense to oppose the Committee s clamour for exceptional procedure. The agitation for martial law has caused some sensation among the Arabs, who say that they know very well what it means; “The Committee, on account of the enmity they bear us, would like to be able to put us to death without question (asked) or answer (given). ” l 2 ' Arrangements were made for a public meeting on the 1st August, outside the North or Mu adhdham Gate, the Forum of Baghdad, to protest against the *See last Summary, i—16. proposed sale at Constantinople of the do- mains of the State in the Baghdad Vilayat in case there was a possibility of their being transferred to foreigners or Zionists! Abdul Qadir Pasha, Khadhairi, a nominal member of the Committee of Union and Progress, and probably the most active and powerful local politician at Baghdad was concerned in the preparations, as were also men of a decidedly Arab nationalist tSee Summary for June 1913, IV-2. 5^6 of politics Suchf as ’Abdul Latif, Thanaiyan, and Jar Ullah, Dakhil. At the eleventh hour the \\ ali announced that a telegram had been received from Constantinople, according to which the lands would not after all be sold at the capi tal, but that instead a Commission would be formed to distribute them amone the people of the country. The meeting was, consequently, not held. It remains to be seen whether the pledge given will be respected. No doubt many members of the present Government, besides rich Jews at Constantinople and elsewhere and foreign financiers, have their eyes on these lands, which will be worth millions in the future, and would like to buy them now for a song. The tempt ition in this case to sacrifice public to private interests, and the future to the present, seems almost too strong to be resisted by the probably corrupt, certainly improvident and impecuni ous, Turkish Government of the day. r 13. About the beginning of August, the Wali of Baghdad received by telegram an official Circular from the Minister of the Interior, describing certain administra- five reforms, which i: is proposed to introduce, apparently, throughout the Otto- man Empire. It may be suspected that the scheme is the outcome of an attempt by the Forte to forestall demands from European powers for better government in The Circular, after stating that the improvement and prosperity of the realm and the happiness of all Turkish subjects are what the Government chieflv aim at seeming, outlined the following changes:— ^ (A) The revenues of all pious trusts (Waquf) tol be spent in future at the places, where the trusts are held, and for the purposes prescribed bv the founders, in accordance with certain rules, which are in course of elaboration. The management of these revenues to be hauded over to councils, representing the religious communities to which the trusts belong. (B) Military service to be performed within the boundaries of the Inspec torate-General of which the soldier is a native, except when concentra tion of troops towards a frontier is necessary on a scale that cannot be arranged with the Army Corps of the Inspectorate-General con- cerned only. (C) Instruction in primary and secondary schools in Arab districts to be given m Arabic, and higher education also to be given hereafter in the language of the country; but no change to be made in the medium of instruction m secondary Government schools, and at the head quarters of \ilayats, Turkish being maintained as the official language. (D) Officials in Arabic-speaking districts to know Arabic, as well as'Turkish • and none to be appointed as such, unless they already know Arabic'.4 {E) Foreign specialists, in such numbers as may be required, to be entertain ed in every Yilayat to expedite the execution of reforms. (F) Supplementary grants to be made from the Central Treasury to Vilayats, to enable them to meet expenditure on education, and public works with wdiich they cannot cope. (G) Decisions of General Councils of Vilayats to be carried promptly into effect. Some unofficial explanations and amplifications by the Minister of the Interior followed the Circular. They were to the effect that: (a) The rule as to possession of Arabic qualifications would not be deemed applicable to alis appointed to Arab ^ ilayats. (b) Qadhis and Presidents of Courts of Justice wmuld be appointed from Constantinople by Imperial decree, but all other appointments w r ould be made locally. (c) At least three of the Ministers of State w r ould be Arabs, and a similar pro portion of other high posts in the Ministries, etc., w r ould be given to Arabs. (d) Of executive appointments, at least five Waliships, and ten Mutasarrif- ships would be assigned to Arabs. (e) In the Senate, Arabs wmuld be in the proportion of tw r o for every Vilayat (? every Arabic-speakng Vilayat). (/) Official procedure in Arabic-speaking provinces would be in Arabic in future, this change to be introduced gradually, however. (g) The powers of General Councils would be extended, and such Councils w'ould consist of Muslims, and non-Muslims in equal numbers. It is not to be anticipated that this programme of reforms will have much effect on the public mind, until serious steps are taken towards its realisation. The people are tired of mere promises of reform, and the Arabs in particular are strongly imbued wdth the idea that the intention of the Committee of Union and Progress is to delude them, and keep them quiet, not to satisfy their aspirations. The political gulf between the Turk and the Arab is wdder and deeper, I believe, in spite of community of religion, than that between the Englishman and the Indian Muhammadan. This may sound a paradox ; but, perhaps, as the years roll on, its truth will become apparent. 14. Tinkering with the judicial system of Turkish Traq, if the expression may be allowed, has been going on for some time, and is probably not over. The Courts of Civil and Criminal Appeal at Baghdad, which were combined into one, some two or three years ago, have now again been separated. Najati* Bey has been appointed President of the Court of Civil *Seo last Summary, I— i. Appeal, a Directorship of Judicial Insti tutions, which he held, being, perhaps, abolished.

Lutfi Bey, Assistant Wali of Baghdad, made a tour to Samarra at the beginning of August, as head of the Gendarmerie % and Police Reorganisation Commission, accompanied by two other +See last Summary, 1—12. members.

Trouble at Basrah seems to be regarded as over for the present, and troops are stillf being sent away from that station, f Sec last Summary. Four mountain guns and 56 artillerymen have now returned from Basrah to Baghdad. Early in August, the 2nd battalion of the 109th Regiment also quitted Basrah for Baghdad en route, it was said, for Samawah. £T.200 had to be borrowed from a merchant for the purpose of despatch ing the battalion to Baghdad. Two guns (apparently mountain) have arrived at Baghdad from Shamiyah, and their place has been taken at Shamiyah by two guns from Samawah. Two machine guns have been withdrawn to Baghdad from the Pusht-i-Kuh frontier, I think from Badrah, and six mountain guns which were m Hasa have arrived here.

I learn from a good authority that the application of conscription to the Oriental Christians of this province has caused them to have recourse to various legal expedients, such as marrying orphans, for avoiding military service altogether; and that the work and course of life of the Christian community is appreciably affected by the vagaries that occur. II.— British Interests and Cases. 1. Mr. Dexter has returned from Musal, after an absence§ of about two months from Baghdad. He reports an excellent § See Summary for June 1913 , ii—3. opening for British machinery. He set up three pumping plants ordered from his firm (Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co.); and the results, when they were set to work, excited the greatest enthusiasm among landowners. Mr. Dexter obtained orders for several more plants. Ihe engines are run with local oil from Qaiyarah. The Musal Municipality have £T. 3,500 in a Bank towards the cost of a water- SU ppl y scheme for the town, and they may move in the matter before long. 2. A much-needed bridge over the Great Zab on the road between Musal and Kirkuk was begun two or three years ago by Turkish engineers. There seems to have been the usual amount of peculation, but 16 piers out of 22 are said to be now finished, and there is talk of the iron work for the superstructure being ordered. If this proves to be correct, I shall draw the attention of British firms to the opening, though it is hard to see how, when official salaries are not being paid regularly, money can be provided for an expensive bridge. 3. I learn that the five tugs|| of the “ Societe de Transports fluviaux en ? Orient”, supplid by Messrs. Stephen Lynch II See Summary for May, II—3. an( ^ are a q f a il ure s. They are the “ Shirin”, “ Sheytan”, “ Shaihab ”, “ Shuhrur ” and “ Susana ”. They are twin screw vessels, a type, which is now declared to be unsuitable for the Tigris, because a screw is not sufficiently immersed, unless kept steadily running, which is impossible in a river, where checks are numerous. The Baghdad Railway Company’s steamers “ Pionier ” and “ Tekrit”, temporarily impressed into the service of the Societe, or substituted for it, are said to be still more unsatisfactory : the former is described as too deep for the river, for which she was not built, and the latter, as too weak to bring up even one barge without great difficulty. 4. It is understood that the Church Missionary Society have decided on a reorganisation, which will place their work in Palestine and Mesopotamia in one and the same territorial division, the staff being made interchangeable. If the result is to infuse a little more life into the general (as distinguished from the medical) work of the Society’s Baghdad Mission, the change will be very accept able.III.— British Indian Interests and Cases. 1. The Indian rogue,* Ghulam Muhammad, arrived at Musal at the beginning • See iaet Summary, iv-t. of Au S u , st &gt; . with , r a n Indian companion, and reported himself at the British Vice-Con sulate, where he stated that he and his friend had been robbed on the way, and had lost their passports, and £T.27 in cash. I am instructing the Dragoman in charge not to issue new passports to them. I suspect that they may have sold them, and in any case they can easily get to Cairo without passports. 2. The results of the efforts j made to organise the Indian domiciled commu t See Summary for January 1912 , vi —7 and nities on an orderly basis, and to protect and assist Indian pilgrims in Mesopotamia are now becoming apparent. Twenty Lambardars or headmen in all have been appointed, as follows :— No. • Town. Quarter. Community. 1 • Baghdad Ras-al ; Qaraiyah, Saba’ Abkar, Murabba’, and ’Awainah.

No Lambardar has been appointed at Samarrah, though there are a few British Indian subjects there. The Lambardars, most of whom have held office for more than a year, have on the whole worked well and satisfactorily, though their appointments are purely honorary. As headmen, some of them have a good deal of work, but the position gives them a little dignity and influence, which they appreciate, among their fellow Indians. The registration of British subjects has become more thorough and systematic, but it is probably still very incomplete, many Indians concealing themselves, ufitilthey find themselves in some actual difficulty. The Consulate-General at Baghdad has granted in all in 1913 no less than 333 certificates of registration, covering 317 male adults, 238 female adults and 447 children—1,002 souls, at Baghdad, Kadhi- main, Samarrah and Ba’qubah, also Musaiyib: of these only 47 male adults, 12 female adults and 19 children are Europeans. (The Baghdad figures in 1912 were 262 certificates, 247 male adults, 190 female adults and 355 children—total 772 souls, including Europeans.) At Karbala this year 532 certificates have been granted for 406 male adults, 461 female adults and 515 children—total 1,382 souls, residing at Karbala, Shifathah, Nukhailah, Musaiyib, Hindiyah Barrage, Tawairij, Hillah, Shamiyah, Kufah and Najaf, also Kadhimain and Salman'Pak. This gives a total of 2 306 Asiatic British subjects in the Baghdad Vilayat whose names are included in registration certificates granted or renewed this year. The Oudh Bequest arrangements for protecting and assisting Indian pilgrims except the Borahs, who are the most numerous class of all, but have an efficient machinery of their own providing—^re now in their third year. The number of pilgrims to whom passes entitling them to assistance were given was : — Persons.

In 1912, twenty-six Indian pilgrims died in the country and charge was taken of their property, the value of which was in a number of cases remitted to relatives in India. IV. —British Official matters. 1 Ort the 26th August, one Sultan, describing himself as the Shaikh of an im portant section of the great Khaza’il tribe on the lower Euphrates, came to the Residency to request British protection for himself and his dependents. He was given the usual answer, that such proposals are not entertained by the British authorities. A similar overture from Musal was declined in like manner through the Dragoman in charge of the Vice-Consulate. . .. 2. The relief* of the Indian military escort of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah was efiected without acci- * See last Summary, IV— 8. dent during the month. The relieved guard, on arriving at Baghdad, were allowed to go on a pilgrimage to Karbala, on return from which they embarked for India. 3. The civil action Sidebotham versus Mashal Brothers has been decided by Major Scott, sitting as Additional Judge of His Britannic Majesty’s Provincial Court at Baghdad. £220 damages have been awarded to the plaintiff. The firm’s local manager, who is a Baghdad Jew, adopted evasive tactics, probably without the approval of his principals at home, and finally contended that the firm were not subject to British jurisdiction at Baghdad,'though he had himself only a short time before registered them in the Consulate-General, under the Ottoman Order in Council, as a British Company. The period allowed for satisfying the decree has expired, and it remains to be seen what action will be required to recover the money. 4. Dr. Johnson, the head of the Church Missionary Society’s Mission here informed me lately that it was intended shortly to begin work on the Mission’s new Hospital at Baghdad, and he kindly asked, if my wife would lay the foundation stone. I pointed out that, as the building was a secular one, and was being erected under a Turkish Farman, Ottoman officials would expect to be invited to any cere mony that might be held, and that, if the Wali were present, it would not be be coming for anyone else to take the principal part in the proceedings. Dr. Johns on eventually decided that, in view of this difficulty, it would be better to lay the foundation stone without any ceremony at all. 5. The Charitable Committee of the Oudh Bequest at Karbala and Najaf having decided to issue £T. 100 worth of free bread to the poor of each of those townsduring the month of Ramadhan, the necessary arrangements were made with the assistance of the British Vice-Consul. It * See paragraph I—i, above. w -jj rea( jj]y understood* what a boon has thus been conferred on weak and poor persons, who would otherwise have had to work as usual every day through the month of fasting. V.—Persian Affairs. 1 . The great Baghdad-Kirmanshah trade route was reported quite safe at the end of the month of July, and I have not heard of any change in this respect. Caravans, however, were mostly using the Kalhur road, in preference to the post road, and they had to pay heavily to the Kalhur Chief for his protection. 2 . The Salar-ud-Daulahf surrendered on t See last Summary, V— 1 . 25 ^ July to a Russian officer in com mand of Persian Cossacks; but, having gone on parole to bid farewell to a Jaf Chief with whom he had been living, he failed to return. He took refuge, after wandering among the tribes for some time, with Falah Beg, the Chief of a small Jaf section, and wrote afterwards to the Sinjabi and Kalhur ‘‘that he had left his conquering army in the hills, and was paying a visit to his dear children in these parts,” and he urged the Sinjabi and Kalhur to join him with all their forces. No response was made to his advances, and it seems that the Salar is now at last thoroughly discredited, and really without any followers. 3 . The local chiefs under Kirmanshah appear to be mostly on good terms with the Government; and the FarmanFarma, the Governor-General of Kirmanshah, who has received machine guns and ammunition from Tehran, has recently allowed some notorious ruffians to be executed by one of his agents. His allowance for military expenses has been stopped, however, as he made no effective use of it. VI.—Foreign Interests other than British and Persian. 1 . It seems certain that M. Orloff, late Russian Consul-General at Baghdad, must have met with some accident on his tour in Kurdistan, though he eventually reached Tabriz in safety, and I have since had a postcard from him from Tiflis. At Sinnah it was said that he had been killed near Merivan, and his caravan plun dered. Dr. Herzfeld, a German traveller, who passed through the same country a little later heard that he had been stripped. 2 . This Dr. Herzfeld, who had been carrying on excavations at Samarrah,J arrived at Kirmanshah on the 1 st August, + See Summary for May, IV— 3. an( j wag hospitably received by His Britan nic Majesty’s Consul, Mr. McDouall, to whose good offices I had recommend ed him. Dr. Herzfeld had travelled via Sulaimaniyah and Qasr-i-Shirin, and obtained presses of an inscription of Ardashir Babakan near the Turco-Persian border of which there was not previously a complete copy, an important historical item being omitted in the only other copy in existence. VII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1 . I was absent from Baghdad from the 5th to the 21 st August on board the “ Comet,” which anchored near the ruins of Ctesiphon ; and there I finished the Persian Gulf Gazetteer, which was the cause • § Seo Summary for August 1912, \I— 2. 0 £ j ourne y§ India about this time last f year. The book is now completed, after labours extending over nearly 10 years, but the mechanical task of correcting about some 2,500 pages of proofs remains to be performed. It can be done at Baghdad, however, where the work of writing could not on account of incessant interruptions all day long. 2 The thermometer on the 23rd August reached 115-3 Fahrenheit in the shade in the Residency garden. This is the highest point touched during the present summer, and represents a much higher temperature in the town. The date was appropriate, coinciding with the 10 th of the native month of Ab, on which day- says a local proverb—■“ the iron nails burn the wood of the house door.” ^ J. G.

Secretary, India. &gt; SUMMARY OF EVENTS IN TURKISH IRAQ DURING JULY (RECEIV ED ON 18th AUGUST) 1913. 1. The mysterious assassination* of Farid Bey and Badi’ Nuri Bey, itself Baghdad. I learn that Mr. Catoni of the Imperial Ottoman Bank was an eye witness of the crime and was about to shake hands with the Military Command ant, when the latter fell dead at his feet. A few days after the double murder, the Wali was successful in inducing rison nearly all succumbing to it. The judicial investigation of the crime produced, in these circumstances, some astonishing results. Colonel Izzat Bey, Commandant of the Baghdad Cavalry Brigade, who had meanwhile been sent to Basrah to assume the vacant command of the Basrah Division, testified that “Farid Bey was sent to Basrah at the instance of the following persons—Najati, President of the Baghdad Appeal Court and President of the Committee of Union and Progress in that town; ’Adil, ex-Minis- -j-And last year Wali of Baghdad; see also last ter of the Interior , Tala at, present Minis- SummaryI, 6. ter of the Interior ; Jamal, Military)* Gov ernor of Constantinople ; and ’Azmi, Director of Public Security at Constan tinople—in order to bring about the death of Saiyid Talib Bey and other persons at Basrah who were pressing for reforms. As a reward, Farid Bey was to be pro moted and given the appointment of Wali of Basrah in addition to that of Mili tary Commandant. The job was previously offered to ’Izzat Bey, but he refused it.” The usual apparatus of significant papers ‘ found among the effects of the deceased,’ cypher wires in their own handwriting, etc., was forthcoming. They included, conveniently enough, a list of 13 persons at Basrah whose deaths had been decreed by the Committee of Union and Progress. The first name in the list was Saiyid Talib’s of course ; another was that of ’Abdullah Sayid Effendi, President of the Court of Testing Charges, the very functionary into whose hands the case now came. On the 15th July Saiyid Talib and ’Abdullah Sayib Effendi visited His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah and sought to impress on him the ‘official,’ in other words their own, version of the affair. Mr. Crow has not expressed a personal opinion as to what really happened, but the facts speak for themselves. The only explana tion, which Saiyid Talib and his partisans can give of the assassination of Farid Bey and Badi’ Nuri Bey, is, apparently, that the assassins, who were dependents of ’Ajaimi, had orders to kill ’Abdullah-bin-Falih Pasha, a Shaikh of the Mun- tafik with whom ‘Ajaimi was at feud and who was with Farid Bey at Fao, but that they bungled the matter. The incredibility of this explanation is its most strik ing characteristic. If an attempt must be made on the life of a tribal Shaikh, two Turks should be killed in his place ? In connection with the deaths of Farid Bey and Badi’ Nuri Bey a true bill of abetment was presently found by the Court of Testing Charges against Salim-al- Khayun, already mentioned, and Hajrani Effendi and ’Atif Bey, the Gendarmerie I.—Internal Affairs. probably an incident of the Arab ‘ Nation alist ’ movement at Basrah, continued to engross public attention there during the month, but excited little interest at Hamad, the brother of the Muntafik Shaikh ’Ajaimi, and Salim-al-Khayun, Shaikh of the Bani Sa ad and ‘Captain of River Police,’ the former of whom had ap peared to be acting in concert with Farid Bey, before his death, to leave Basrah. By the 5th July it was understood that a reconciliation had taken place be tween Shaikh ’Ajaimi and Saiyid Talib, and that ’Ajaimi had telegraphed to Con stantinople exonerating Saiyid Talib of disloyalty towards the Porte, with which he had been charged. Saiy id Talib’s influence at once became supreme in Bas rah, the civil officials, even the Wali himself, and the officers of the military gar- it need not be done when he is in the company of two Turkish officers ; and, even if it is, is it possible that the intended victim, an Arab, should escape and that C312FDCommandants of Basrah and Muntafik, respectively. Of four men in custody on a charge of being the actual murderers, three were dependents of Salim-al-Khayun and one a dependent of Hamad, the brother of ’Ajaimi. The proceedings there fore wore the appearance of a vigorous effort by Saiyid Talib and his friends to carry war into the enemy’s camp by making Farid Bey’s own creatures and allies responsible for his death and that of his companion. It was not to be expected that the present Government of Turkey would acquiesce tamely in the tournure, so frightful for the Committee of Union and Progress, which the case, under Arab direction, had begun to assume. On the 12th July Najati Bey, lately Procureur-General at Baghdad, now Director of the whole Judicial Department there, left for Basrah to take charge of the proceedings. [ 'See above, also Summary for April-I, 7. Tllis Wa f the individual* mentioned by Colonel ’Izzat Bey as being privy to a Committee plot against the life of Talib Bey. Najati Bey reached Basrah on the 18th July in an armed Government motor launch from ’ Amarah. Had he arrived in an aeroplane, even, it would have made no difference ; he could obtain no footing at Basrah, and he even seemed to be in personal danger there. On the 20th July he left again for Baghdad, having effected nothing. A day or two later a telegram was received at Basrah from the Procureur-General of Appeal at Baghdad, calling for the papers of the case ; but they were not sent. Saiyid Talib’s party seem determined to keep the records as well as the management of the judicial machinery under their own control. A by-result of the crisis has been the dismissal of A’la-ud-Din Bey, Wali of tSee Summary for May-I, 5 . Basrah after onlyf two months’ tenure of office. Like his acting predecessor he was an Arab himself, though a member of the Committee of Union and Progress, and his position must have been extremely disagreeable. He probably dis pleased the Committee by failing to declare martial law or take some other strong measure at their suggestion. It is idle to speculate as to how long Saiyid Talib will be able to maintain his present dictatorship. His footing seems to me to be that of an acrobat upon a tight-rope rather than of a man standing on firm ground. Arabs do not willingly submit for long to any but tribal authority, and against that even they frequently rebel. Bamazan and the date season, which are now at hand, will, however, pro bably bring some respite from political excitement. 2. The Baghdad newspaper “ Zuhur ”, the organ of the Committee of Union and Progress at Baghdad, had a leading article on the 30th June in which it inveighed against the- idea of non-Muhammadans being allowed to reside in Mu’adhdham, a pleasant northern suburb of Baghdad containing the tomb of Abu Hanifah, the founder of the Hanafi School of Islam. This is a fresh raking- up of an old unpleasant question, and it is not likely to serve any practical pur pose ; I notice that there is now a large Jewish house on the river, well in the direction of Mu’adhdham. 3. The Constantinople Post, which reached Baghdad from Aleppo on the 11th of July, was very late, and was said to have been attacked near ’Anah. On the 18th July 48 sabres of the 31st and 52 of the 32nd Regiment march ed from Baghdad to ’Anah, where it was rumoured that two gendarmes had been killed. Evidently there is trouble of some sort on that side, perhaps due to the ’Anizah, who at this season come down from Central Arabia to the Euphrates. 4 4. About the 22nd July two Effendis (’Umar and ’Arif), who were travelling by carriage to Aleppo, were robbed by Arabs within a few miles of Baghdad and returned to complain to the Wali. Jalal Bey, after ascertaining that their loss amounted to about £T 50, caused that amount to be paid to them from an unknown source at a sitting of the Administrative Council. No explanation is forthcoming, so far, of this unusual procedure ; possibly the money was advanced from Govern ment funds in the expectation of its being recovered later from some one who could be held responsible for the robbery.5. About the 18th July there was a disturbance near Ja’arah, apparently connected with the same disputes as the fighting there last year. The people tried to expel* Hasan Agha and Haji Mukhif * See Summary for March-Apni 1912—1,8. from certain lands, but troops and gendar mes arrived [to their assistance. Four men were wounded on the Government side. 6. In the last week of July trouble of some kind occurred near Samawah on the Euphrates in consequence of an attempt by Government officials to execute a war rant for the arrest of one Saiyid Taffar, living among the Al’Abas. In a camp between Samawah and Durnaji, the Turks had at the time of the occurrence, it is said, 2 infantry battalions, 4 field guns and a mountain gun, besides which the “Fu- nt” carrying other guns and a machine gun, was on the river near by. The losses to the troops are given as 15 killed, 20 wounded, and 8 missing. The Bagh dad Nishanji battalion and 2 machine guns seem to have started from Baghdad for Samawah on the night of the 1st August. It is stated that various neighbouring tribes, —the ’Ajib, Budur, Tobah, and Zaiyad,—are not unlikely to make common cause with the APAbas, in which case there may be a serious rising. 7. An outbreak is reported in one of the Kurdish districts belonging to the Wilayat of Musal, where all has been quiet since Nazim Pasha’s settlementf with the Hama wand in 1910. It seems that the ts« Summary for August 1910-1, 2 : and for Mutasarrif of Kirkuk, ’Alin Ullah Bey, lately went to Rowanduz and from there sent a detachment of regular troops into the territory of ’Abdus Salam, the Shaikh of Baraizan, to capture some robbers and collect Government taxes. The detachment met with resistance, however, and after losing a lieutenant and 8 men killed, 12 men wounded, and 20 rifles, it had to return to Rowanduz. The Mutasarrif then telegraphed to the Wali of Musal for assistance, and the Wali called on the Commandant of the Musal Army Corps, As’ad Pasha, a Muham madan pervert from the Maronite Church, to take military action; but the Command ant, who has the strongest objection to complying with such requisitions by the civil authority, and who had already been asked to send a force to the north of Musal for the restoration of order, paltered with ' he demand as long nc he could. At length, on the 2nd July, the Musal Nishanji battalion and the st bat talion of the 104th Regi ment, some 360 men in all, with two mountain guns ard 50 mule loads of ammuni tion, started for Zakho and Jazirah, and theSrd battalion of the 105th Regiment, 170 strong, was told off for the expedition to Rowanduz. The Mutasarrif of Kirkuk was still at Rowanduz, calling for military aid from Kirkuk, Musal and Van, and insisting on the punishment of the tribes; but the Wali censured him for having provoked a difficult conflict in the hills at a very unsuitable time and ordered him to come down to Arbil. By the 14th July, the Mutasarrif having then arrived at Arbil, troops had reached Rowanduz, and it was under stood that the 3rd Battalion of the 105th Regiment (170 men), the Battalion of the 103 rd Regiment from Arbil (80 men) and two Battalions from Kirkuk (400 men), besides some artillery, were there. The Mutasarrif next returned to his headquarters at Kirkuk, where he present ly received a telegram from Constantinople informing him of his removal from office. 0 . . 101A T in HeJ is one of the best and most successful tSee Summary for August 1910—1, 10. , . . , , ,, ■ , , administrators seen m this part of Turkey in recent years, and his dismissal has caused general regret and evoked many protests. A subscription of £ T400, for his benefit, was immediately raised by the people to enable him to pay his debts and return to ConSiantinople, his pay being two months in arrear and the Government having refused him travelling allow ance on the ground of his dismissal. I have always heard ’Aun Ullah Bey described as a just and energetic officer, and it is now stated that he had increased the revenue yielded by his Sanjaq from £ T 70,000 to £ T 130,000, had established a technical school, introduced agricultural machinery and effected other improvements, besides maintaining good order every •where with a firm and impartial hand.4 ' Nothing has been done by the troops at Rowanduz since the Mutasarrif’s re turn from the front. 8. The Shaikh of Baraizan recently attacked, defeated, and plundered the Harkiyah tribe while crossing the Zab in his territory on one of their annual migra tions. The Harkiyah Chief, Ahmad Agha, was killed, and his brother was wounded. The pretext was a raid which the Harkiyah were said to have committed on another tribe; and of the spoil taken from them some was handed over to the Shat ariyin and some to the Ottoman authorities ; but all was not accounted for by the Shaikh. The real cause of the Shaikh’s displeasure with the Harkiyah was that they had helped in *See summary for Aprii-May 1910 I, i. Turkish operations* against him in 1909. A The Harkiyah are now cutting the roads irom Musal to Aqrah and Amadiyah by way of retaliation. 9. There is great insecurity everywhere in the Musal Wilayat. A caravan was attacked and a Christian muleteer killed recently between Musal town and Tall Kaif, and there are said to have been numerous other attacks on caravans, some ac companied by loss of life, within a few miles’ radius of Musal in other directions At a very short distance from Arbil, the Dizzai Kurds have been committing robberies on the high road. The Tigris route is blocked above Jazirah by the Kurds of ’Ali Agha, and there are symptoms of a rebellion against the Government inSinjar. 10. The Farman of appointment of Jalal Bey as Wali of Baghdad was formally read at the Sarai on the 5th July. Mr. Sauer, American Consul, and I, unobserved, watched the ceremony, which neither of us had seen before, from under one of the immemorial thorn trees in the Sarai courtyard. The Naqib of Baghdad then re cited an Arabic prayer, which was punctuated most unbecomingly throughout by the detonations of an artillery salute. Finally, Jalal Bey himself read a long speech in Turkish announcing liis policy. His back was to the people and his voice inaudible, but it was afterwards ascertained that lie had said he would give his attention mainly to public security, to material improvements, especially in irriga tion and agriculture, and to education. The proceedings were spiritless, and the Wali looked so melancholy that it was impossible not to feel for him. 11. Constitution Day was celebrated as usual on the 23rd of July, but this year the Walks reception was held in plain clothes and there was no ’ military review. Visitors to the Sarai were informed there by the Wali of the re-entry of the Turkish forces into Adrianople, regarding which an official telegram had been j received by the Wilayat during the night. One Consul to whom the Wali j remarked that “ the Turkish Army had been asleep but was evidently awake now ” was so dazed by this attempt to claim the reoccupation of Adrianople as a military success that in reply he could only ejaculate “ Ah !”. 12. The Gendarmerie f and Police Reorganisation Committee, headed by t5ee Summary for May— i, 3. Assistant Wali of Baghdad, visited Anah during July and returned to headquarters on the 2oth. 13. The Wali has founded a branch at Baghdad of the Muhammadan Chari table Association (Jami at-al-Khairiyat-al-Islamiyah), the President of which at thelcapital is Prince Yusuf ‘ Izz-ud-Din, the heir-apparent. ’Abdul Majid Bey, ex-Deputy for ’Amarah, has been elected president of the Baghdad branch. 14. It is understood that Saiyid Kamil, the only one of the persons^ arrested %See last Summary— I, 6. &lt;rt Baghdad for political reasons who was ^ . . not liberated here, has since been released at Constantinople. The Zaurah , the official Gazette of the Baghdad Wilayat, is now being published in Arabic as well as Furkish. The matter in both languages is the same, and the whole is printed on the same sheet. This may be the outcome of recent§ §See Summary for May 1912 — I, 6. promises on the subject of the Arabic language, but at the same time it is merely a return to the old practice at Baghdad. ?I A i L 5 c 16. It seems to have been notified at Constantinople, on the 28th June 1913, that State lands to the amount of 28 million donums in various Wilayats, including those of Baghdad and Musal, were for sale. In this province the lands, formerly belonging to the Sultan’s Civil List but now classed as State Domains and speci fically described as Amlak-i-Mudawwarah, are very extensive. The scheme, when it came to be known and understood here, excited lively apprehension in many quarters ; it appeared in the light of a surprise sale of the spare land of the province over the heads of its inhabitants to strangers, possibly foreign capitalists. Tele grams of protest were sent to Constantinople, and I understand that Muhammad Fazil Pasha, Daghistani, and even the W&lt; r li himself, remonstrated with the Gov ernment on their precipitate action. It is believed that assurances have now been received that the Government lands in this province will not be sold. It is impossible to imagine a more fatuous policy than the sale of the unoccupied and unirrigated lands of Mesopotamia for what they will fetch in present circums tances, yet this seems to be what was originally intended. When the lands have been made irrigable they will fetch an enormously enhanced price; and in any case they ought to be sold here, not at Constantinople, and the lots should be small enough to give natives of Mesopotamia a chance. 17. On the 18th July, the 3rd Battalion of the 111th Begiment, brought from ’Amarah to Basrah two months before, left again for 'Amrrah ; it was about 150 strong. A J ew days later, 2 mountain guns and some 40 artillery men were re turned to Baghdad. The garrison of Basrah on the 23rd July was about 700 in fantry, but of these only about 400 were paraded in honour of the Constitution. 18. The Dragoman of His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Musal, at present temporarily in charge, informs me that the monthly expenditure of the Musal Wilayat is about £ T. 40, 000, which is more than the average local revenue. The expenses of the Musal Military Division (£ T. 15,000), of the Kirkuk Military Division (£ T. 10,000), and of the Gendarmerie of the whole Wilayat (£ T. 3,000) are regularly met; but the salaries of other officials are falling into arrear. II.—British Interests and Cases. 1. The iron gates* for the Hindiyah Barrage were duly delivered at their • See last Summary-n, i. destination through the energy of Mr. Tod, Messrs. Lynch s manager at Baghdad, who went in very hot weather to Shinafiyah on the Euphrates, where the barges had stuck, and took charge personally of the work of hauling them over the shal lows. The tugs and barges were also got out of the river before it closed for the season, and no claim for demurrage on the part of Messrs. Lynch will now arise. The “ Bulbul ”, one of the tugs, was fired on by Arabs below Nasiriyah on her way back to Basrah, where she arrived about the 11th July, but no harm was done, and the Wali of Basrah was asked to arrange for a Turkish guard from Nasiriyah downwards upon the “ Ishtar ” which followed. 2. Mr. Whitley, Sir John Jackson’s representative here, informed me lately that it was calculated that lands on the Hillah Branch or Old Euphrates which at present yielded £ T. 25,000 per annum to the Government in agricultural taxes, would produce £ T. 70,000 next year, in consequence of the completion of the Bar rage, and £ T. 150,000 the year after. I do not know by whom the calculation was made, nor whether it is reliable. 3. The Anglo-Persian Oil Companyj*, represented at Baghdad by Messrs. . „ „ f a ;i 1019 tt ^ Strick, Scott and Co., are now doing ex- + See Summary for April 1912—11, 4 n / i • n/r -itt-i , i &amp; , cellent business. Mr. Wilson, the agent, told me at the beginning of July that he had lately disposed of 13,000 cases of kero- sine in one transaction, and that his other sales were then at the rate of about 1,000 cases a day. He was about to export 2,000 cases as an experiment to Kirmanshah in Persia, where no oil but Bussian had been seen before in any quantity. The municipal motor launches at Baghdad are now running on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s petrol. During the week ending 12th July, the selling prices of the various oils at Baghdad were : Anglo-Persian G. S. P. 38, Bussian, 39, 40, and American 42 per case, and the number of cases sold were 3,000, 520 and 130, res pectively. The (American) Standard Oil Company were stated to have discon- C312FD6 tinned sending oil to Baghdad pending a territorial arrangement in regard to markets between themselves and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Mr. Wilson is negotiating for the purchase of land near Baghdad on which to erect tanks for the storage of oil, etc., in bulk. He is also endeavouring to obtain the necessary official approval of the site, but this seems more difficult. 4. Messrs.

An ex- cellent map of the city and environs of Baghdad, on a large scale, is among the results of their labour ; printed copies of it will soon be available. The electric scheme will probably be under consideration by the Porte for some time. 5. Shaikh Falih-bin-Banaiyahf of the Bani Lam visited Basrah again and . 0 . T _ while there entered into communication with t See last Summary 1, 5 . His Blit!innk Majesty’s Consul. He in- formed Mr. Crow that Shaikh ’Ajaimi of the Muntafik, according to his own state ment, had been called to Basrah by the late Farid Bey, the Wali, and the Gendar merie Commandant to kill Saiyid Talib ; that promises made to him by the Turkish authorities, who also obtained sums of money from him, had not been kept; and that he desired to complain to the British representative of their faithless behaviour. Mr. Crow repelled these overtures for his intervention with a suitable reply. 6. Inhisnumber of the 28th July, under the title “ Our English Friends ”, Salah-ud-Din, Kirkukli, editor and proprietor of the “ Zuhur,” indulges in a tirade against Britain, which he accuses of faithlessness towards Islam. Sir E. Grey’s remarks in Parliament on the re-occupation of Adrianople by the Turks are the text of his remarks. Europeans in general are styled with a fine mixture of phrases “ Sons of the Cross,” “ Sons of Nero,” and “ Beasts of the West.” III.— British Indian Interests and Cases. 1. A few days before his departure for India on the 22nd of July, M. Zulfiqar t See last Summary. III. Khan*, the agent of His Highness the JNawab ot Kampur, called on me to say good-bye. I understand that he is a Sunni, as was also the last Nawab of Rampur, though the present Nawab is a Shiah,—and he is, therefore, all the better suited to act as an intermediary with the Turkish authorities. Since his first interview with me, Zulfiqar ’ Ali Khan has been to Karbala, Najaf, and Samarah as well as to Kadhimain, and has arranged about accommodation for the Nawab and his suite at those places. He did not tell me much, about his own proceedings here, but from other sources I have learned that the Military Inspector- General of the Musal and Baghdad Army Corps was induced to parade the whole field artillery of the Baghdad garrison for his delectation, and that an inspection of the Gendarmerie was held in his honour at which photographs were taken by a professional photographer, doubtless to be shown in India. These compliments, though unusual, are quite harmless. The Nawab’s agent tried to draw me into political discussions, arguing strongly i that Britain ought to undertake the defence of the whole of Persia against Russia. I I remarked that such an undertaking would necessitate a great increase in the j Indian Army, which I did not think that Indian opinion would endorse. He replied that only “ Gokhale’s party,” meaning perhaps modern Hindus generally, would object, to which I rejoined that their views were worthy of consideration. The prospective visit of the Nawab of Rampur has excited great interest in Indian circles here. Mr. ’Abdur Rabb, the Residency Second Dragoman, at present on leave, and Mirza ’Ali, Lambardar of Old Baghdad and Pilgrim Guide, were in frequent attendance on the Nawab’s agent while he was here. The Lambardar was in fact so pre-occupied with the Agent’s visit that I had to ask him to provide a substitute to carry on his own duties. The attitude of these employes is perfect ly natural, especially as the Nawab will probably make it worth their while to have given assistance.2. The * Indian school at Karbala Seems to be going on satisfactorily.

The Turkish authorities have done nothing to harassj it recently. IV.— British official matters. 1.

The prisoners Joynes (| I!

I allowed the If prisoner Ahmad Din, w hose record at Baghdad was a very f See last Summary-IV, 7. bad ° ne ’ the choice of bein g dealt with by me under Article 81 of the Ottoman Order in Council, 1910, or of quitting the Turkish dominions voluntarily, it being understood that he w r ould remain in custody until his departure. He preferred to leave Turkey on the condition mentioned and started from Baghdad for Basrah, on his way abroad, on the 13th July. It was elicited in his examination that he had been born a Christian in the town of Sialkot in the Punjab, had been a master in a Mission School, and owns land at Jindar Khurd, than a Kariyanwala, f «l“3il Jalalpur Jattan, district Gujrat, but had reverted, on growing up, to the original religion of his family. It might be well that the Indian police should keep an eye on him, as he is sure soon to get into trouble wherever he goes. 4. I have had to deal with the case of another Punjabi Indian, Ghulam Muham mad, a quack eye-doctor, who became involved in a brawl in a low hotel in Baghdad and who was also wanted by the Turkish authorities on a charge of practising medicine wdthout a diploma. He left Baghdad, under pressure from me, before the Turkish summons for him arrived, and I have since heard of his being at Samar- rah. A procession of semi-blind persons arrived at the Besidency one morning soon after his disappearance to complain of having been tricked by him, and I hand ed them over to the Residency Surgeon for treatment in the charitable dispensary. I have warned His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Aleppo that Ghulam Muhammad will probably pass through that towm and has been ordered to report himself at the Consulate there. His fixed residence appears to be in Cairo. From two Bibles which he left behind along with some other effects it would seem that he too must have been a Christian at some time ; or possibly he had taken charge of them for Ahmad Din, with whom he was acquainted and at one time meant to travel. 5 5. ** Abu Muhammad did not take advantage of the chance allowed him of _ „ , , 0 TT7 c escaping and is now a prisoner in the Re- sidency. His case wull be tried by Major Scott, I. M. S., Residency Surgeon and His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, who has recently on my recommendation been appointed Additional Judge of His Britannic Majesty’s Provincial Court at Baghdad. The evidence against the prisoner seems strong, and later it may be necessary to send him under a guard to India, a difficulty which I had hoped to aviod. The alleged fraud by him, which is rather a complicated one, is not without its ludicrous features. Jhe Persian shop-keeper was told that he must pay 90 shillings for failing to register himself as a British subject in past years and replied that he would gladly give 200 to acquire British nationality. He had mistaken £ ‘shilling” for a Persian word of similar sound8 meaning a “hop” or “antic”; on hearing that it meant a coin of the realm his face fell, but he decided to go through with the transaction. 6. Mr. Sawyer, an officer in the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Coy's service, being constantly intoxicated on boardship and at Baghdad, and having on one occasion created a disturbance and done damage to goods in a shop, I offered him the alternative of finding security to keep the peace under Article 81 of the Ottoman Order in Council or of leaving the country of his own accord, he to remain under detention in the Residency until his departure. He chose the latter and left on 15th July for Basrah en route to Karachi, having been 8 days in the lock-up. Had he been left longer at large his behaviour might have got him into serious trouble with the Turkish authorities. 7. An action for £400 damages on account of wrongful dismissal, etc., has been commenced by Mr. Sidebotham, a young English mechanic, against Messrs. Mashal Brothers, his employers, a British firm at Baghdad. I have made it over for trial to Major Scott, in his capacity of Additional Judge. With two Assess ors he has already been engaged on it for some days, and at least a week more will be required to complete the taking of evidence. This and the other cases men tioned above illustrate the growing need for a Political Assistant to the Resident at Baghdad. Not every Residency Surgeon could take up judicial work as Major Scott is doing; and, if I had personally had to try this case, which turns chiefly on petty questions of fact and opinion, all other work would have had to be laid aside. 8. The relief of the Indian military guard of the Kirmanshah Consulate, con sisting of a non-commissioned officer and 6 sowars, arrived at Baghdad from Karachi on the 10th July and left again for Kirmanshah on the 14th. They ar rived safely at Qasr-i-Shirin in Persia on the 18th, where the Residency Qaw- was accompanying them handed them over to Mr. McDouall's representative. No difficulty occurred about their arms on this occasion, all the necessary arrange ments having been made beforehand; but from Baghdad to the Turkish frontier the arms were in the charge and control of a Turkish escort which accompanied them. 9. On the 11th July I paid the Wali an unannounced visit at his house and found him alone. Unlike the majority of Turkish Walis he speaks Arabic quite well. He seems to lead a very solitary life, and his only recreation to be to sit in the balcony of his house overlooking the river about the hour of sunset. He is evidently a painful and diligent worker, and I think he means well, and that his ideas are now reasonable and moderate. Our conversation was inter rupted at the outset by the arrival 'of the Persian Consul-General with his ample flow of talk and persiflage. Jalal Bey returned my call a few days later, but we did not get much further. There is something invincibly stolid and uninteresting about the average Turkish official; he may be a more serious man than the Persian, but he is far less amusing. The house occupied by the Wali has come to be called even by Turkish offi cials,—the 4 4 maison de vakf ’ being placed by ’Abdul Qadir Pasha Khadairi, a leading Muhammadan merchant here, at the disposal .of each successive Wali—it is strongly suspected rent-free. Jamal Bey, Zaki Pasha, Jalal Bey have all occupied it in turn. 10. Mr. 'Abdul Rabb, second Dragoman in the Residency, now on leave, lately informed me that the Committee of Union and Progress had asked him to give lessons in English in their school at Baghdad. He said that he was willing to do so out of office hours, without remuneration, and he wished to know whether I had any objections. I replied that, as the Committee of Union and Progress were a political association, I thought it would be better that he, as a foreign official in the country, should not connect himself with their school. 11. The approach of a general agreement among European nations with reference to their interests in the Middle East induces me to add supplementary * _ , iC , TT n io remarks to those* which I made on related * See last Summary—II, 2, and IV, 12. i • , i ^ subjects last month.A s°i i 9 Apart from ordinary trade, the principal economic interests in Mesopotamia ‘ that are in dispute between European nations are the following, in order of im portance :— 1. Irrigation, 2. Railways, 3. Steam Navigation, 4. Oil Production. Irrigation .—As is clearly shown in the Baghdad Trade Report for 1912, the present trade of Baghdad is largely a transit trade to and from Persia. It seems probable that this transit trade will eventually be diverted from the Basrah- Baghdad-Khanaqin route in Turkey to other routes directly connecting Persian ports with the heart of weste r n Persia. Mesopotamia will then be thrown upon its own resources, Those resources are primarily and predominantly, perhaps even purely, agricultural. They are at present, in com^yirison with those of other similar countries, almost entirely undeveloped. It is their development by irrigation which will one day give Mesopotamia a place in the world and make the province equal, if not superior, to Lower Egypt in population and affluence. Consequently it is the irrigation agency of the future which will control the production, and to some extent the distribution, of wealth. The assessment of land revenue and water rates, perhaps their collection also, will be in the hands of this agency ; and its hold upon the people will therefore be powerful. If irriga tion is made a State concern the local authority of the Turkish Government will be strengthened and the Turkish Treasury relieved ; but if it slips into the hands of a company, or companies, an imperium in imperio may be created, and the profit to the Ottoman Government reduced within narrow limits. Railways.-^A larger export trade, with a correspondingly increased import trade, will demand improved communications. Reasons for thinking that these communications will take the form of railways, not of lines of river-steamers, are given further on under the heading of navigation. Railways, however, will be only auxiliary to irrigation and agriculture, both of which might be greatly extended without their aid. It is to be observed that the railways of Mesopotamia, like those of India and | Egypt, will be of local, not of world-wide importance. The contrary supposition is a demonstrable fallacy, and it is essential that no illusion on this point should be allowed to survive. It is idle to imagine that a mixed land and sea route, involving transit through the territories of different States and resort to water carriage in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of ’Oman sections, not to mention the crossing of the Bosphorus and in some cases of the English Channel as well, can ever compete in cargo traffic with continuous loutes by sea between Europe and the East. Eve i in regard to passengers and mails the superiority of the Baghdad route is dubious, for its discomforts would be great, and its advantage in time over a direct sea service run at Atlantic speeds would be inconsiderable. It is the internal development of Mesopotamia which must make Mesopo^ tamian railways prosper, if they are to prosper. The most premising projected line in Mesopotamia is that which will connect Baghdad with Basrah ; the line from Baghdad by Musal and Aleppo to the sea at Alexandretta is too circuitous to compete with a Baghdad-Basrah line, when the latter is opened. The centre of the irrigated portion of Mesopotamia will be* a little below Baghdad, or about 300 miles by rail from Basrah ; while the centre of the Punjab irrigation colonies, which export grain profitably to Europe in enormous quantities via the Suez Canal, is aboutf 750 miles from Karachi. To illustrate the real nearness of Baghdad to the Persian Gulf it may be remarked that Baghdad, if it stood on the Indus instead of the Tigris, would be situated in Sind, not in the Punjab. It C312FD r * See Planaccompanying Sir W. Willcack’a Irrigation of Mesopotamia,’ 1 1911. f A clerical error in last Summary — V. 5, should be corrected,“one-half to one-third” being substituted for “one-half to two-thirds.’’ This mistake did not occur in the telegrams sent to Simla and Constantinople.10 follows that, to say nothing of imports, the Baghdad-Basrah railway will be a great carrier in the future of exported wheat, and possibly cotton. If the Baghdad- Alexandretta line should be open before the other, a portion of the exports may be temporarily diverted to the Mediterranean basin ; but, on equality of conditions being restored, it will revert naturally to the Persian Gulf. After my appointment to Baghdad I reported to the best of my ability on the question of the Baghdad-Basrah Railway, and my despatches mentioned below may still be found useful: — Despatch. To Government of India. To His Britannic Majes ty’s Ambassador, Con stantinople. 17th October 1910, to His Britannic Majesty’s Am bassador, Constantinople. No. 938 No. 937-57. 17th November 1910, to Government of India No. 1015 No. 1016-63. 20th March 1911, to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambas sador, Constantinople. No. 229-9. 31st March 1911, to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambas sador, Constantinople. No. 268 No. 267-13. Steam Navigation .—Steam navigation, the only existing means of transport, is an interest hostile to irrigation and the economic expansion of the country. It is barely feasible at present in certain seasons, and when the Tigris is drawn on for irrigation it must cease. In this connection the following extract from a min ute written by Lord Curzon in India with reference to the Karun is of interest:— “Any such scheme, if effectually carried out, will practically destroy the Karun as a navigable river, and will put an effectual stopper upon the enterprise of Messrs. Lynch. “ Even now the depth of water is only 3 feet in many places, and the steamr ers run aground constantly on their way up to Ahwaz. A reduc tion of even 6 inches in the depth would block navigation for the four months from August to December. Our Indian experience in the Punjab has shown that large navigable rivers, such as the Jumna, Ravi, Chenab, Sutlej and Jhelum, are drained quite dry for most of the year by big irrigation schemes, and I entertain little doubt that this also would be the fate of the Kanin/' Even supposing the general welfare of the country to be sacrificed, and the Tigris to be declared out of bounds to the irrigation engineer, there seems little prospect of steam navigation on that river surviving in competition with rail ways. The length of the river is about 540 miles between Baghdad and Basrah, ( that of a railway will be about 325 miles. The ascent of the river by steamer •takes 5 days, the railway journey will occupy one. With a railway, communi cation will be daily and regular; with steamers, it will remain uncertain and in terrupted. If the railway takes a central course through the country and has short feeder branches, exports will be brought to it more easily than to the river ; and similarly it will be a better distributor of imports. It is not to be supposed that, once railways exist, goods will be transhipped from ocean to river-steamers at Basrah only to be put upon the railway at Baghdad for despatch to Persia, Musal, Karbala, etc. The question of comparative freights is a difficult one; but if the Baghdad-Basrah is a guaranteed line, which there seems every reason to \ expect, it will be in a position to kill any fluvial rival by adopting low unpaying | freights in the beginning. When the country has made some progress, railway freights need not be high in order to be remunerative. Sir William Willcocks* 'See “ The Near East” of 2nd June 1913. wrote lately; ^ Give the Tigris and Eu phrates escapes into the deserts, and Baby lonia will again rival Egypt, and the railway will be one of the best paying concerns in the world.”Oil Production .—This interest is placed last in the list because its importance is not yet proved, and may not be great. Oil and bitumen exist in the province at various points (Qaiyarah, Duz-Khurmatu, Kirkuk, Mandali, Hit, etc.), but nothing definite s known of their quantity or quality, or of the possibility of work ing them. Remarks .—I subjoin a few reflections on the political bearing of the above facts. The Hindiyah Barrage, the first of Sir William Willcocks* projected irrigation works, has now been nearly finished by a British contractor; but there have been constant difficulties about funds during its progress, and there is no indication that the Porte takes a serious interest in the further execution of the Mesopotam ian irrigation programme. Such being the case, I lately telegraphed to H. B. M s Charge Affaires at Constantinople suggesting that resources might be appro priated by the Financial Commission at Paris to the guaranteeing of future loans for irrigation I was led to take this step chiefly by the consideration that enterprises not provided for (as the German Baghdad Railway will be) by the Paris Commission may perhaps be shelved, of necessity, for many years. I am now apprised that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Foreign Cffice, the arrangement suggested lies beyond the scope of the Paris Commission, and that the most which can be hoped of that body is that it will leave Turkey in possession of financial resources sufficient for general purposes, including Mesopotamian irrigation. It is impossible not to fear that the demands of other projects, such as Armenian reforms, which are more closely under the eye of diplomatic Europe than the unobtrusive but vital interests of irrigation in this province, will endanger the future of the W illcocks programme; and that, through interruption of the work, Britain may lose the foothold which she has acquired, laboriously and meritoriously, in the Mesopotamian field. The only remedy that I can suggest is—if Turkish statesmen will agree to it—an advance of public money from the British or Indian ex chequer, on some general security, for 'the exploitation in the interests of the j Turkish Government of what is now probably the greatest financial asset remain ing to the Porte. In respect of railways, so far as my information goes, construction and man agement down to the Persian Gulf seem to be secured to Germany, but the entrance of British capital into the Baghdad-Basrah section of the line does not s'eem to be barred, and could perhaps be promoted. That a Baghdad-Basrah railway ought to be built, and that British capital ought to enter into it as largely as pos sible, are to my mind self-evident propositions, provided only that irrigation is pushed in a manner which will give the railway, at no very distant date, paying quantities of produce and return imports to carry. As pointed out in one of my railway despatches, irrigation and railway engineering problems are closely inter laced, and could be solved better together than separately. Steam navigation is a British and an old-established, interest; were it not so, little would have been heard of it. As long as the country remains in a state of suspended animation river navigation may suffice and continue; but when irrigation and agriculture assert themselves and the land is covered with hundreds of square miles of grow ing wheat—as would happen under a British Government, to judge by Indian ex perience, in less than 20 years—navigation will at once be found inadequate. Then the antiquated steamers, crawling painfully round re-entrant curves and over sand-banks, will quietly disappear from the side of the railways with their processions of gliding trains. To sacrifice a monopolist position in regard to navi gation for an improved position in regard to railways would therefore seem to me, if the future be regarded rather than the present, true wisdom on the part of Britain. But, if I am not mistaken, it is to the interest of the (German) Bagh- f dad Railway and the (British) Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Coy., for different reasons, to oppose a railway between Baghdad and Basrah. As regards oil, the whole position is as yet too nebulous to admit of an opinion being formed. Only for the sake of clearness, and to avoid periphrasis, I have thrown my observations into a dogmatic form j and I should not have presumed to expressmy opinions so freely as I have done did I not conceive, on the information before me, that the questions touched on are still largely open questions. The policy to be followed must depend largely on the view taken of the pro bable future of Turkey. If it be considered that Turkey can last, some mixture and internationalisation of interests in Mesopotamia may be desirable to obviate I the incidence of polit : cal responsibility (for the maintenance of order, safety of | European lives, etc.) upon a single Power. If, on the other hand, it is thought that Turkey must break up and Mesopotamia become a peculiarly British sphere of influence, then the intrusion of foreign interests other than British southwards of Musal would appear to be fraught with grave future inconvenience. I trust that the momentousness of the parting of the ways which has been reached in the history of the Middle East will be held to justify my remarks. They perhaps go beyond the ordinary scope of a local representative, but they are made deliberately and with a full sense of responsibility after three years’ careful reflec tion. V.—Persian Affairs. 1. The Salar-ud-Doulah has re-appeared in his old haunts; and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah informed me, under date of 24th June, that the Prince was then at Divandarreh, about 35 miles north of Sinneh and was negotiat ing with the Persian Government. The Kalbaghi tribe had declared their allegi ance to him, and he had been joined by some 50 Jaf Kurds belonging to Turkish territory; but the people of Sinneh refused to admit him to their town. On the 1st July the Salar was reported to have gone to Aoraman. By the 9th it was stated that a force of Persian Cossacks under Russian officers had arrived at Sinneh, and that troops were moving against him from other directions also ; and it was believed that the Salar had betaken himself to Jaf territory. 2. At the end of June it was reported that the trade route both below and above Kirmanshah was safe, but exactions were complained of by camel caravans from Turkish territory. VI. — E OREIGN INTERESTS OTHER THAN BRITISH AND PERSIAN. 1. The German school at Baghdad appears to be now efficient and well managed* which it was not before. The present headmaster is a Mr. Krause. The exhibition marking the end of the school year was held on the 13th July. There appeared to be about 60 pupils whose ages ranged from 24 downwards, and they were divided into 4 or 5 classes. Only two of the pupils were Germans ; the rest were natives. German and French are taught in all the classes, English in the two highest only. One boy made a speech in German in which he thanked the German Emperor for having placed the means of educating themselves within reach of himself and his fellow-scholars. My wife and myself were the only Europeans other than Germans invited to the exhibition, at which the Acting German Consul, Mr. Kalisch, presided. Circumstances prevented my availing myself of the invitation, but my wife went, I paid a surprise visit soon afterwards to the Church Missionary Society’s school. It did not strike me at all favourably from the pedagogic point of view, and I am now reporting officially on the subject of instruction in the English language at Bagh dad. 2. The German Vice-Consul at Musal left that place on the 3rd July for Van, where he will pass the summer. 3. Dr. Herzfeld, the German arch geological excavator, left Samarrah finally for Europe, via, Persia, on the 7th or 8th July. 4 4. On the 15th July the acting Russian Consul-General at Baghdad was informed by telegram that Mr. Orloff had arrived safely at Tabriz. Mr. Popoff had been about a month without any news of him and was beginning to be anxious, especially as it was said that Mr. Orloff after leaving Gulambar had had to turn back from a place one stage beyond Tavaleh on the way to Merivan, that he had then found his way through Turkish territory by Bistan to* Baneh, but that he had met with hostiletreatment of some sort at Bustan. According to a letter which His Britannic Mai- esty s Consul at Kirmanshah wrote me, Mr. Orloff was at Merivan about the 1st July, and Mr. Popoff now wonders whether he may have got here by doublina back from Baneh through Persian territory. ^ ^ Mr. Soane, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Qasr-i-Shirin annears to have accompanied Mr. Orloff on the earlier part of his tour in Kurdistan but I have not heard this from Mr. Soane himself, who has been ill lately. .

The political* situation at Basrah, already serious at the end of May, grew * See last Summary 1 - 7 . ' • ■ ' worse during June. The new Turkish Wila- yat Law and the soi disantAx&amp;h nationalist movement suddenly disappeared, and the stage was occupied instead by the factions of Shaikh ’Ajaimi and Saiyid Talib contending around the tottering but unfallen figure of the Turkt ’Ajaimi posed as a vindicator of the authority of the Porte agi.inst the rebel Talib, and he appears to have been received in that character by the Commandant of the Basrah division (Farid Bey) and even by the Waliof Basrah (’Ala-ud-din Bey). About the beginning of June an attack was made by riverain Arabs, probably at the instigation of Saiyid Talib, on the Shaikh's base of operations at Ghabishiyah; while ’Ajaimi continued to hang in a threatening manner on the outskirts of Zubair immediately to the west of Basrah. Meanwhile steps had been taken, no doubt, by ’Ajaimi’s pari isans, and apparently with some success, to obtain condem natory of Saiyid Talib from certain ’Ulama of Najaf; and the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhamn.erah seem to have been approached on ’Ajaimi’s behalf, but without the desired result of detaching them from Talib’s cause. On the 15th June some members of the Sa’dun Muntafik family who are at variance with the head of their house arrived in Basrah, and Montague-Capulet in cidents between their armed retainers and those of ’Ajaimi began to occur. On the 17th it became known to Mr. Crow, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, that one house had been bought and another hired in Basrah for ’Ajaimi; and on the 19th armed followers of the Shaikh were established in them under his brother Hamad. There was reason to believe that Farid Bey, the Military Commandant, was en couraging these movements by the Muntafik Chief; he had at least sent mules and an escort to Zubair to meet Hamad. Before this ’Ajaimi had sent a message to Mr. Crow through Mr. Van Ess, an American missionary, hinting that he might be obliged to attack Basrah in the near future, and enquiring what the attitude of the British Government would be in such a contingency. Under instructions from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador a Constantinople Mr. Crow informed Mr. Van Ess that no reply could be given to the Shaikh’s question. His Biitannic Majesty’s Consul remonstrated unofficially with the Wali on the danger of allowing armed men from outside to collect in the town and on the impropriety of Farid Bey’s conduct in that connection; but ’Ala-ud-din Bey could not be persuaded to regard the matter as serious or to exert his authori ty. Meanwhile Saiyid Talib’s life was considered by his friends to be in danger &gt;—it was in fact at one time reported at Baghdad that he had been assassinated— and the Shaikhs of Muhammerah and Kuwait urged him to leave Basrah and its neighbourhood for a time, but he would not. When the stroke at last fell it was not upon Saiyid Talib. On the 19th June Farid Bey and Badi’ Nuri Bey, the newf ' Mutasarrif of Muntafik “ one of the best t See Summary for Apnl,l-». ^ Turkish writers at Constantinople,” left Basrah together in the Turkish gunboat “ Marmaris,” nominally to inspect military stations on the river in the direction of Fao. They returned on the evening of the 20th to Basrah ; and, as they were landing from a boat in the ’Ashar creek, they were surrounded and attacked at short range by Arabs armed with rifles. The Military Commandant was killed, and the Mutasarrif of Muntafik and a gendarme were mor tally wounded. There was some firing again in the town the same night. The information as yet available at Baghdad does not enable me to conjecture in whose interest or with what object the crime was committed. Time may show whether Saiyid Talib or the domestic enemies of ’Ajaimi had most to gain by it C234FD 1 -*«■**■- I in O ! lu LU O p* CO d 01 ■' - LU 0 fir 13 O lL O 1C, H &gt; d 0and whether the blow was heavier to the Turkish Government or to the Muntafik Shaikh. Ihe late barid Bey, who was an ardent Union-and-Progressist as well as *See Summary for December 1912, I—'5. and efficient soldier, was* Mutasar-rif of Muntafik himself not long ago and may have made enemies of his own there. In any case the assassi nation of the Grand W azir of 1 urkey at Constantinople a few days previously may have suggested the outrage at Basrah. On the 26th June it was stated privately i n the Sarai at Baghdad that the Wali of Basrah had suggested the despatch of a military force against ^Ajairni, who was only a few miles from Basrah ; but that his proposals had been vetoed by Muhammad Fazil Pasha, Daghistani, Inspector-General of the Musal and Baghdad Army Corps. Is it to be inferred from the Wali’s suggestion that, Farid Bey, the friend of Ajaimi being dead, Saiyid Talib has now captured the official ear, as about a month ago he seemed on the point of doing ? On the 27th June I learned that a Muhammadan merchant at Baghdad had received a private telegram from Basrah advising him not to send any goods there, from which it would appear that there is still a feeling of insecurity at the latter place. 2. Further details are now to hand in connection with the expulsion*)* of the f See last Summary, i—8, Jurks from Masa. It appears that Ibn Sa’ud by his victory at Hofuf came into possession of 4 heavy and a dozen other guns, besides a quantity of Turkish Gov ernment specie. The Turkish officials at Qatif succeeded in saving some at least of the contents of the Government Treasury at that place and in conveying it to Oqair. The steamer John 0. Scott, carrying the Turkish troops expelled from Hasa, loitered for some days in the neighbourhood of Bahrain. On the 25th May a detachment from the 1 urkish garrison in Qatar with two small guns arrived off Bahrain in native sailing boats, and on the next day about 400 men with the two guns left in small craft for the Hasa coast under the command of Major Nuns Bey, At the departure of this expedition it was given out that negotiations with Ibn Sa’ud were intended; but instead a landing was effected at ’Oqair, and about 60 men were established in a fort at some distance from the beach. Ibn Baud’s people quickly came down in force upon the invaders, and the latter were apparent ly obliged to re-embark, the garrison thrown into the fort having first to surrender and gi\ e up their arms. After this failure the detachment borrowed from Qatar seems to have been sent back there, while the John. 0. Scott ” conveyed the Ifite Hasa gainson to Basrah, arriving at that place on the 4th June with . about 400 men on board. The ez-Mutasarrif, the Qadi, and other Turkish officials from Hasa, with their families and about 30 gendarmes, had arrived at Basrah some days previously. Ibn Sa’ud’s position still is that he is loyal to the Sultan and will be glad to govern Hasa under him ; but that the administration of the Sanjaq by Turkish officials has been a failure, and that he cannot permit it to be resumed. He is said to have informed the Wali of Basrah officially of his views. It is unfortunate that Captain Shakespear’s { visit to Ibn Sa’ud should have t See last Summary, n— , 5 . preceded by a month only the Amir’s . , ^ attack upon the Turks in Hasa, especially when such publicity has been given to his journey in the Baghdad native press, I had lately occasion to call on the Fathers of the French Carmelite Mission at Baghdad and was made the unwilling recipient of their congratulations on this latest British Success . My disavowal of the existence of British interests in Central Arabia was received, it seemed to me, with more jocularity than politeness. It is not likely, however, that any permanent bad effect will be produced. No political impression in this country has any duration, and already a more plausible counter suggestion has been brought forward by the Muntafik Shaikh ’Ajaimi, who has accused Saiyid Talib to the Porte of bein the author of the Hasa revolution. 3. Military movements due to the political situation continue. The composite infantry unit which left Baghdad for Basrah on the 27th May was ascertained by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to be only 200 strong. On the 3rd June, in the grey of dawn, a large Turkish steamer left Baghdad for Basrah with more troops ; a full military band on board, playing a plaintive Turkish air, gave a pathe-' - r\ 3 tic note to their departure. This steamer carried 140 men, mostly artillery and men of technical corps, with a couple of field or Q. F. guns and 2 or 3 machine guns, also explosives and ammunition. I have obtained what I believe to be a full and accurate statement of the dis tribution of the troops of the Baghdad Army Corps, which I shall reduce to shape and submit to Government as soon as possible. I may partly anticipate it here by saying that it shows the headquarters garrison at Baghdad to be now reduced to the following :— Cavalry. 168 men and 104 horses. Artillery. 16 field guns, 2 mountain guns. 2 Q. F. guns. *No michine guns. Some spare guns, probably heavy or field. 2fi5 men. Infantry. 5 battalions totalling about 740 rifles, and one non-commissioned officers’ training battalion between 100 and 150 strong. Thus in all there are only about 1,300 rank and file of the combatant services at Baghdad at the present moment. Yet there is no sign here or at Musal of the reserves being called out. The allegation that Government does not call out the reserves because it is feared they would refuse to come up is perhaps not without foundation. On the 17th June 57 men were despatched by steamer from Basrah to Qatar. From this it would appear that the Turks mean to hold on to Qatar, if possible, and use it later on as a base for the reconquest of Hasa, No doubt when the t see last Summary, l._9. present troubles are past the Porte will have moref reliable troops available than ever before for service in these eastern regions. 4. The J See last Summary, I—.10. Marmaris ”,J as incidentally shown above, has returned to Basrah from Bombay ; but nothing more has been heard of the “ Hamidieh.” 5. No serious tribal disturbance has as yet occurred in the country, notwith standing the precariousness of the situation at Constantinople. Ghadhban,§ Shaikh of the Bani Lam, and his brother Falih, now appear to be § See last Summary, ii.—6. seeking the favour of the Turkish authorities, M c t c T and there is no immediate apprehension of See last Summary, I.—9. • u j- i i . . , serious] | disturbances by them such as might endanger the navigation of the Tigris. A statement made by Falih to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah some time ago, that he and his brother had killed their uncle Shabib for siding with the Turkish Government, proves to be entirely without foundation. The state of Baghdad city is not satisfactory. In one week there were 5 cases of theft in the Jewish quarter alone, and between the 26th May and the 4th June 6 cases of wounding with daggers or revolvers occurred in the whole town. At the beginning of June some 20 convicted criminals at Karbala succeeded in breaking out of jail. They were pursued by gendarmes who killed two and &lt; wounded one of them; but the rest escaped. * * Treated as a branch of artillery by the Turks.4 An encounter has occurred near Shamiyah between! Government, troops and the A1 Ziyad tribe who are withholding their revenue. Mr. Hony, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal, gives a deplorable account of the state of the Musal Wilayat and of the districts to the north of it. The country between Diyarbakr and Jazirah is in a state of anarchy ; all rafts on the river are being plundered; and jealousy between the civil and military authorities at Musal has so far prevented the despatch of troops to Midiyat, where they are required to restore order, I fear that, unless a strong and respected government is established at Con- stantinople shortly, these local troubles may intensify and extend. 6. Meanwhile, under the party now in power, all omens for the future are unfavourable. At the beginning of June the Baghdad police were engaged in hunting for a supposed emissary of Egyptian and Syrian nationalists. On the 10th of June „ „ , . r « I was informed that the feeling* between see &gt; ummary or. pn , — Turkish and Arab officers in the Baghdad Army Corps was growing worse, and that only .respect for that fine old patriot Muhammad Fazil Pasha, the Military Inspector-General, prevented an open rupture between them. On the top of this came the news of the assassination of Mahmud Shevket Pasha, the Grand Vazir of Turkey, at Constantinople, which was known at the Baghdad Sarai on the night of the 12th June. “ Maulids ” for the soul of the late Grand Vazir were read at the School of the Committee of Union and Progress and at their Club oh the 19th of June. The most striking consequence at Baghdad of the crime at the capital was the sudden but quiet arrest on the 14th June of— , (1) Yusuff Effendi, Suwaidizadah, an Arab, one of the most respected citizens of Baghdad and a t Se© Summary for April, I— .&gt;, member of the Administrative Council; (2) Saiyid Kamil Effendi, Arab, proprietor of the late “ Bain-an-Nahrain ” newspaper ; (3) Shukri Effendi, of Kurdish origin, a teacher by profession ; and (4) Salman Effendi, Arab, an advocate. One Mahmud Effendi, editor of the defunct “ Bain-an-Nahrain, ” was arrest ed simultaneously at ’Amarah ; and orders were issued for the arrest of Hasan % t See Summary for May 1912 , H-19. Sali , h &gt; formerly Qadhi of Diwaniyah, but could not be executed because he was away in Egypt. As it was not clear whether these arrests were connected with the Arab nationalist movement or with the assassination of Mahmud Shevket Pasha, I informed His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador by telegram of them and of the sequel. It was at once noticed that those against whom action was taken were all persons who had been obnoxious to Ahmad Jamal Bey, now Military Governor of Constantinople, when he was Wali here last year; and I have since learned on un impeachable authority that the arrests were made at his personal instigation. Great indignation was felt at the treatment of the Suwaidizadah, who is much res pected, and whose practical loyalty has never been doubtful; and there was talk of disturbances and of an attempt at rescue. Many leading men interested them selves on his behalf, in particular Muhammad Fazil Pasha, the Military Inspector General, whose opinion carries great weight on account of his rank, age, position, disinterestedness, and well known patriotic sentiments. In the event the despatch of the prisoners to Constantinople for immediate trial by the Court Martial there, which had been ordered, was postponed; and on the 16th June all the prisoners were released except Kamil Effendi, who had, it is said, sent a silly telegram to Yusuf ’Izz-ud-Din, the Heir Apparent, congratulating him on the death of theGrand \ azir, which His Highness had at once placed in the hands of the police. Kamil Effendi has since been despatched to Constantinople and, if he gets there in time, will no doubt be hanged. 7. The judicial massacre of political opponents at Constantinople by the pre- sent Government on pretence of their having had a hand in the death of the late Mahmud Shevket has thoroughly disgusted the non-Turkish population of Bagh dad. That it is a judicial massacre is not doubted because of the shortness of the proceedings, notwithstanding the difficulty of tracing out and proving a large con spiracy, if such existed. Such a wholesale sacrifice of victims to the manes of the late Grand \azir is contrasted with the inaction of the same authorities after the murder of Nazim Pasha, “ when not even a fowl had its throat cut ”. Some Arabs remark that such is the natural work of men who have no faith and one of whose principles is Allah-mu-Lazim ” (“ No God is necessary ”); others only say Bah ! Let the Turks exterminate one another ; so much the better ! ” The way m which the Agence Ottomane dwelt on the executions was offensive to all readers, omce reporting them the Agence has confined itself to safe news about Bulgaria, oervia, etc. ; and everyone at Baghdad wonders what it is that is happening at Constantinople and cannot be disclosed. 8. Jalal Bey*, the new Wali of Baghdad, arrived by river from Musal on the * See last Summary, L 4. 22n( ^ J une an d immediately assumed office, but his Farman of appointment has not yet been read at the Sarai. He has, however, found time to open a new public building, a Post and Telegraph Office, this being a diversion of which the modern Turkish official seems never to tire ; and he has called for the plans of the Baghdad electric t See last Summary, ii. i. tramways, which had been| passed by the Municipality before his arrival,- with a \ iew to having them altered. He says the new streets are not being made wide enough. ^ He informs me that Basrah is not under his supervision as it was under that of Nazim Pasha, and, in a restricted degree, of Jamal Bey also. 9. On the night of the 26th June an Arabic piece entitled “ La Trahison ” was acted at the Syrian Church in aid of a charitable scheme organised by the Synan Archbishop. The story was taken from the history of France in the time oi hrancois I, and it related to the murder by a superseded general of his success ful rival, which w'as duly enacted on the stage. Everyone must have thought of rsazim Pasha or Mahmud Shevket Pasha. The Wali, who was sitting in the first row, was visibly discomposed; and the Assistant Wali was heard to remark that the piece w r as ‘ £ mal choisi Perhaps the w r orst part, from the Turkish point of view, w r as the moral, which reflected severely on recent Turkish practice. A biother of the murdered general was in the end induced by a priest to renounce e idea of revenge and to pray, kneeling on the stage, “ Forgive us our trespasses as v\e forgive them that trespass against us’\ The presentation of such a play at such a time could not but strike one as a curious freak on the part of His Grace M. Athanase Georges Dallal, who is a mild and unassuming prelate. Per haps he thought, from a religious standpoint, that it might have a good effect. Very few persons at Baghdad would have ventured on his undertaking, and it is possible that he has not yet heard the last of it. II. —British Interests and Cases. 1. Work at the Hindiyah Barrage is entering on its final Hages. What is immediately required is to convey to the Barrage and place in position the iron gates or sluices that are to close the openings in the masonry dam. These gates are /0 in number and w r eigh 4 tons each. There was delay in obtaining them, due no doubt to the irregularity wuth which the money for the works has been provided by the Turkish Government, and the steamer bringing them from England had unfortunately long passage to Basrah. The result was that w T hen the gates arrived at Basrah the Euphrates had begun to fall for the season. Every effort was made to accelerate their despatch up the river, and Messrs. Lynch s and Sir J. Jackson’s chief representatives both w T ent personally to Basrah Tlie tugs and barges with the gates passed Samawah on the 15th June and all promised w'ell; but they failed to reach Shamiyah within the next few days, and. C234FD6 Mr. Tod, Lynch’s manager, has now gone down the Euphrates to try and bring them over the remaining difficult places by lightering or other means. It is feared that if the gates do not reach the Barrage before the river next rises the work may be damaged by floods, for in anticipation of the timely arrival of the gates the new river bed leading the Euphrates on to the Barrage has been almost completely excavated. There will also be heavy demurrage to pay to Messrs. Lynch if their tugs and barges are detained up the Euphrates during the summer and autumn, and the chance of their being able to return to Basrah at once is daily diminishing. 2. At this critical moment the supply of funds for the Mesopotamian irriga tion works seems to have again failed. I understand that Mr. Whitley, Sir J. Jackson’s local manager, received orders from his firm to close the works on the 20th June unless money was forthcoming. Mr. Whitley’s representations to the Wilayat resulted in £T.5,000 being provided by the Turkish Government, who also sent orders that any money subscribed for the Turkish Internal Loan at Baghdad should be utilised for the works. The latter sum, I am told, amounted to less than £T.1,500, so that the relief obtained will be short-lived. The local authorities are now, it is said, trying to induce wealthy individuals at Baghdad to lend money for the completion of the Barrage. The above information has reached me from native sources, Sir J. Jackson’s representative perhaps not being authorised by his principals to discuss the ! firm’s pecuniary difficulties with me. If the facts are confirmed at London or Constantinople it would be worth while, I think, for the British or Indian Gov ernment to advance public money for finishing the Hindiyah Barrage on some general kind of security. The result might be to obtain for the British Govern ment an advisory position in regard to irrigation in Mesopotamia, and for British contractors a preference in regard to the construction of works under Sir W. Willcocks’ programme. Irrigation, it cannot be too frequently repeated, will be the dominating interest in the Mesopotamia of the futuie. Transport enter prises, railway or steamer, will be ancillary only, and their success will depend mainly on the results of irrigation and agriculture and the growth of purchasing and paying power among the people. 3. The use of oil engines and centrifugal pumps for agriculture is extending up the Tigris north of Baghdad. A number are now at work between Baghdad and Samarrah. Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company’s machines now reach to Tikrit, and Messrs. Lynch and Company have set one up at Musal, where they have a mechanical workshop. The latter firm have lately sent Mr. Dexter, one of their engineers, to Musal to study the extension of their business there ; and they propose to tender for some machinery required by the Musal Technical School, which has obtained a grant of £T.1,000 from the Musal Municipality. Mr. Tod, Messrs. Lynch’s manager at Baghdad, means to visit Musal himself in the autumn ; and Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company are considering the question of setting up a repairing shop there, as they have orders to execute for the installation of a large plant. Mr. Cree writes to me privately : “ I don't worry about the Germans. We will be established and selling British machinery in Musal long before them. Our caution only makes the ultimate end surer”. The good judgment and success of Mr. Cree during the past few years argue strongly for the soundness of his views. III.— British Indian Interests and Cases. 1. I asked the Acting Wali, as I intended, to have the treatment of the . See last Summary, III. l. Indian* Hukmi carefully investigated ; but no reply has been received from the Wilayat as yet, and my own agents have not been able to obtain any fresh evi dence in the matter. 2. On the 19th June a letter of introduction from Mr. Bum, Chief Secretary to the Government of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh in India, was handed to me by Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Khan, an official of the Rampur State, who has come7 to arrange for a pilgrimage by the Nawab of Rampur to this country later in the year. I had already heard something of the pomp in which the Nawab intended to travel, and I therefore endeavoured to ascertain in consultation with his agent what special arrangements were likely to be required. I found that the Nawab desired not only to receive exceptional quarantine and customs facilities but also to be allowed to bring with him a quantity of arms and 100 soldiers (in uniform, armed) of his own troops; to be accorded by Turkish batteries the same salutes as he receives on ceremonial occasions from British batteries in India ; and to be given a permanent escort of Turkish troops during his sojourn in Mesopo tamia. As some of these desiderata obviously present diplomatic difficulties I have advised Mr. Zulfikar ’Ali Khan that the Nawab should submit them offi cially to the Government of India with a view to their consideration. I have also written to Mr. Burn on the subject. So far as I know, the Shah of Persia on his pilgrimage to Karbala and Najaf in 1870 is the only foreign ruler who has been allowed to bring troops of his own into Turkey on such an occasion. I am sure that the Nawab would really enjoy his pilgrimage more if he could be persuaded to make it in a private character. If he tries to give himself importance here he is not unlikely to meet with humiliations at the hands of the Turks. On the other hand, especially as he has plenty of money to spend, the Tuikish authorities may possibly decide to give him a highly honorific reception. The NaWab is probably attached to the idea of a pilgrimage in state, for, if I am not misinformed, he has already deposited something like £30,000 with Messrs. Cook at Bombay to wards the expenses of his tour. I am not sure what impression the Nawab’s visit may make on the Turkish Government and local population with reference to the relations of Muhammadan States and the British Government in India. Something will depend on the charac ter and conversation of the Nawab himself, and something on whether the first visit at Baghdad is paid by the Nawab to the Resident or by the Resident to the Nawab, a point in regard to which the Government of India will no doubt give instructions. In any case, however, the impression made will be evanescent and of little practical importance. IV. —British Official Matters. 1. I omitted to report last month that Mr. M. Mackenna, Chief Officer of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s steamer “ Mejidieh”, committed suicide on board her at Baghdad on the 12th May by shooting himself with a Brown ing pistol. The usual inquest was held, the result being to show that the deceased committed suicide while temporarily insane, and the papers were sent to Constanti nople. 2. The 3rd June was observed at Baghdad as a holiday, being His Majesty the King-Emperor’s birthday. As Turkish official rejoicings were still* partially in ^ 0 f , abeyance on account of the war, no official *See Summary for April I. 11. J i i i .i • j • reception was held this year; and in the afternoon a small garden party only, for the Residency employes, was given. I understand that this mark of consideration was not unappreciated by the Turks. At Karbala, where 1 had left the Vice-Consul free to follow his own judgment, fes tivities were held as usual. 3 4 * * 3. Lieutenant Townshend, R.E., Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf, made his _ „ secondt annual inspection of the Baghdad t See Summary for March-April 1912, VI. 8. Residency buildings between tbe 28th May and 9th June 1913, returning afterwards to Bushire from which he had come. 4. Mr. Cator, Judge of His Britannic Majesty’s Supreme Court for the t See last Summary IV. i. Dominions of the Sublime Ottoman Porte, with Mrs. Cator, arrived^ safely at Baghdad on the 7th June. They left again in carriages for Aleppo, on. their return journey to Constantinople, on the 18th. On the 13th-14th June thev visited the ruin of Ctesiphon on the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” in company with my wife and myself.5. The trial of Joynes took place at Baghdad on the 10th June. The charge* against him having been amended ^by *See last Summary, iv.f2. the Supreme Court, he pled guilty to .ct i on j i __ larceny of £T.441 and embezzlement of £1.180, and also to bigamy. For the first two offences he was sentenced o tour, and for the last offenc* to two years’ imprisonment, in all to six years’ imprisonment, with hard labour. Malta was appointed as the place of his deten- lon He was despatched to Bombay under a native military guard by the British mail steamer that left Baghdad on 17th June. 6. Joynes was accompanied to Bombay by another prisoner, Muhsin ’Ali ran, an Indian, who has a curious history. He was originally a native magis- ra e in India ; but m 1897, having been convicted of knowingly making use as genuine of a document which he knew to be forged (or some cognate offence), he was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and fine. While out of prison on bail pending the result of an appeal which ultimately failed, he fled the country: and after a short sojourn at Masqat, he settled at Kadhimain where he married. Here he attempted, though unsuccessfully, to become an Ottoman subject; and it was decided not to tahe any steps for his removal to India in case of difficulties arising with the Turkish authorities in the absence of an extradition tieaty be- t\\ een Britai i and Turkey. He had frequent quarrels with his own relations by ood and marriage m this country, and his presence as a sort of outlaw was some times very embarrassing to this Residency. On the 8th June, a charge of att3mpted murder having been brought against him by one Manju Agha, who was at once his brother-in-law and his son-in-law he hastened to surrender himself voluntarily to me. After taking from him in his own wilting a request that his surrender might be accepted, I had him placed m custody and proceeded to hear the charge against him. It appealed to be fabricated and was eventually dismissed. Muhsin ’Ah Kh#n, who seemed quite contented with his position as a pris oner, was treated more or less as or parole in the Residency, and no spocial prc- cautions were taken to prevent his escape. He professed to be tired of existing as he did at Kadhimain and to think that his life would be in danger if he went outside the Residency gates. On the morning of the 15th June, however, he was missed. I immediately sent Qawwasses out in all directions to arrest him, if possi ble , and 1 was obliged to refer to the Tuikish authorities though this was what Government particularly wished to avoid, for I was afraid that he might do an injury to Manju Agha or some other of his relations. Fortunately he was recap tured in the afternoon, in a garden some miles down the river, by two mounted Qawwasses who had been ordered to take the road to Qarrah. The capture was a smart one as the old man he is 60 or more—had already disguised himself in Arab clothes. His despatch to India having meanwhile been ordered by Government, he was sent off, as alieady mentioned, under the same guard as Joynes. His immediate family, consisting of his son (Ahmad) by a former marriage, his son’s wife (Saltanat) who is also his own step-daughter, his present wife (Akhtar Jahan Begam) and a small daughter (Maryam) by his present wife, were enabled by the liberality of relations at Baghdad to travel to India along with him and will probably settle at Lucknow. The present wife is a Wasiqah-holder in her own right, and it is understood that the son of the deceased wife has inherited something from his mother. There was a dispute after Muhsin ’Ali’s arrest as to the custody of the girl Maryam which was decided by me, sitting as a civil court, in favour of Ahmad, her half-brother. 7 * * * 7. About 9-30 p.m., on the 21st of June three shots, fired somewhere outside, were audible in the Residency garden ; but such occurrences are too common at Baghdad to call for notice. An hour later, however, Turkish police came to the gate to report that an Indian had bolted himself into his room in a hotel where h e was living, had fired off three shots from a revolver, and did not reply when spoke n to. I went to the place, about a quarter of a mile distant, with a Qawwass, and found a number of Turkish police and gendarmes collected there. It soon appearedIMiJW! ■ ■■■■■■■■■I 6&gt;7 9 that the man was drunk ; and, as he refused to open the door, I had it broken down, secured his revolver, which was lying on the table, and had him taken to the Resi dency. He proved to be one Ahmad Din, an Indian employed on high wages by Sir J. Jackson, Limited, whose wife lately brought serious accusations against him in my Consular Court, and whose conduct I now learn from other sources to have been brutal and violent. The Turkish authorities have not sent for him yet, and mean while he has been put in the lock-up and proceedings have been begun against him under Section 81 of the Ottoman Order in Council (Security for future good conduct and Deportation). This case has drawn attention to another similar one which is now being in- \ vestigated. There are signs of an Indian influx distinct from that of the ordinary pilgrims, and unfortunately some of the first immigrants are of unsatisfactory character. Baghdad seems to have a demoralising effect on young Indians, which is attributable partly to the semi-European style of the life (drinking at hotels, etc.), and to the absence of the restraints to which they are accustomed at home. 8. In another case an Indian, Abu Muhammad, is accused of having obtained £ T. 5 on false pretences from a Persian shopkeeper at Karbala by undertaking to procure for him a certificate of British nationality, which he was not in a position to do. Abu Muhammad, who is a native of Patna, was convicted by my prede cessor at Baghdad of forgery and suffered a year's imprisonment. After his release the Vice-Consul at Karbala, wishing to give him a chance of earning an honest livelihood, employed him as a sort of private clerk, and later he got him a place as a writer in connection with the Oudh Bequest distributions. The Vice-Consul thought that under his own immediate supervision no harm could occur, but the event has apparently belied his expectations. I have issued a warrant for Abu Muhammad's arrest together with private instructions to the Vice-Consul to give him a chance of escaping from the country, after which, the warrant remaining in force, he will be unable to return. This seems to meet the real requirements of the case, as the Persian shopkeeper deserves to loose his money. 9. In the “ Zuhur ” of the 2nd June * “ Muslim ” has again attacked the . see last Summary, IV.-2. management of the Oudh Bequest This time he only says that the Mujtalnd-Dis- tributors who accept money under it will be held responsible in the Day of Judg ment for having caused much injury to the Islamic world, from which it may be inferred that his stock of arguments is nearly exhausted. 10. The Mujtahid-Distributor Saiyid Muhammad Baqir, Tabatabayi, of Karbala died there somewhat suddenly on the 16th of June. He was the most important Mujtahid holding a Distributorship under the Oudh Bequest, and his death is much to be regretted, for his influence was useful and was generally employed on the right side. By nationality he was a Persian. Although much money must have passed through his hands since his appointment in 1892 I under stand that he has died heavily in debt. His funeral is said to have been the most magnificent ever given to a Mujtahid at Karbala, and the shops and bazaars of the town were kept closed for three days out of respect for his memory. The usual deluge of telegrams to this Residency recommending candidates for the vacant Distributorship at once set in and the Turkish telegraph office must have made quite a considerable sum out of it. 11 11. On the 5th June Jar Ullah, Dakhil, the agent of the Najd Amir Ibn Rashid at Baghdad, sought an interview with me ; but I declined, feeling sure that he had something to say about the Arab nationalist movement or the expulsion of the Turks from Hasa. On the 15th ’Abdul Latif Thanaiyan, editor of the suppressed local newspaper “ Raqib ”, wished to see me, ostensibly in connection with the arrest of Yusuf Effendi, Suwaidizadah. As it was clear that intervention on my part in that matter could do no good, I did not receive him. There is absolutely no reason for conciliating Arab nationalists while they are still in the opposition. If ever they should come into power, which does not seem likely, it will be time enough then to arrive at an understanding with them about British interests.On the 29th June I received a visit from a personage of a kind different from * „ , ^ „ T j the two last mentioned: this was Muham- See last Summary, I 4. ^ ^ * the present Inspector . General of tlie Musal and Baghdad Army Corps who has been already twice men tioned above. The old man repeated the assurances which he never fails to make to me of his regarding Britain as the one true and honourable friend of Turkey; and he added that after the loss of Tripoli he had tried, both officially and un officially to enforce this view on the Government of Turkey, but in vain. I said that I knew I could state to him, without being disbelieved or laughed at, that Britain really wished both Turkey and Persia well, and was doing her best to keep them on their feet, as could be seen in Persia, where the British officials were sup porting the new Gendarmerie to the utmost for the good of the country though there was not a single British officer in it. The Pasha remarked incidentally that he often wished to give me information about things, but that he felt it would be improper for him in his official position to do so. I replied that I appreciated his honourable feelings, and that he had probably noticed that I never tried to draw information from him even in con versation. He told me that the present was a time at which no one in Turkey dared to say what he thought; and I had little difficulty in gathering that his opinion of the present Turkish Government is very unfavourable. Muhammad Pasha is very deaf and he talked throughout in a pitch appro priate to a brigade parade ground, which caused me some anxiety lest there should be indiscreet listeners within earshot. 12. On the 23rd June, with reference to matters observed in the last batch of Foreign Office confidential prints received at Baghdad I wired to the Government of India and His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople that Mr. Lynch’sf appreciation of the t Compare Summary for April, II— 8. railway position in this country seemed very faulty. The important section of the Baghdad Railway, it appeared to me, would be that between Baghdad and Basrah. To the irrigated Meso potamia of the future this section would be what the Samasata-Karachi line is to the grain-growing districts of the Punjab in India. The sea journey of the grain from Basrah to Europe would be longer than that from Karachi,, but its inland course to the port by railway would on the other hand be only one-half to two-thirds as long. Possibly grain from middle Mesopotamia might be sent to Europe as cheaply through Alexandretta as through Basrah ; but this seemed hardly probable, especially if the Suez Canal were to reduce its dues in competition with the railway. I thought therefore that grain would be a large and valuable export, and that the Germans perhaps reckoned on obtaining it for the railway, and that this might be the explanation of the little interest shown by them as yet in steam navigation. It seemed to me that Britain should press for the early completion of the Baghdad-Basrah section, with a view to keeping the Persian Gulf on an equal footing commercially with the Mediterranean in re gard to Mesopotamia, and that she should endeavour to obtain a proper degree of direct influence over it. I thought that, when once the railway was open from Baghdad to both seas, river navigation would very soon be moribund. After commenting on other points I mentioned a strange piece of information which Messrs. Lynch’s representative at Baghdad had lately given me. It was to the effect that he had received a mutilated code telegram from his principals in London in which, after apparently stating that they would protest, or that he should protest, against the grant of navigation rights in Mesopotamia to an “ out sider ”, not named, they enjoined him not to associate himself with any agitation on the’ subject at Baghdad. This telegram seems difficult to understand when read in context with the negotiations in which Mr. Lynch has been engaged at home. On the same day I telegraphed to the same authorities suggesting that any admission by His Majesty’s Government of the principle of the abolition of the British post offices in Turkey should not extent to those at Baghdad and Basrah.'■t-.y 11 Here, in view of a possible break-up of Turkey ultimately, and meanwhile of the development of preparatory foreign spheres of interest, it seemed incumbent on the British Government to preserve every kind of priority which they already possessed in Mesopotamia, their proper and natural sphere in the Ottoman dominions. Be sides the Baghdad and Basrah post offices, I mentioned the Residency guard and the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” as appurtenances to be jealously guarded for the present; and I might have added that the desirability of excluding foreign influence from a sphere entirely British was an additional reason for making every effort,- even at the cost of serious sacrifices elsewhere, to prevent the Baghdad-Basrah section of the Baghdad Railway from remaining or becoming a German interest. 13. I visited Jalal Bey,* the new Wali of Baghdad, on the 26th June, and he •See last Summary, I —4. returned my call on the 28th. We were not strangers to each other, as I had had to deal with him three years ago when he was Mutasarrif of Karbala, and very obstinate I remember I found him. He has grown older and greyer : Time and worry do not spare even Young Turks. He and his Political Secretary asked me about the meaning of the play at the Syrian Church, the Wali professing that he could discover no moral in it. I said that I thought forgiveness of enemies was the moral intended. 14. Mr. Hony, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal, proceeded on leave on the 21st June. The Drgoman, Nasir, remains in charge of the Vice- Consulate ; but he is not authorised to negotiate with the Turkish authorities. V. —Persian Affairs. 1. I should have mentioned last month that Colonel Hjalmarson, the Swedish officer commanding the new Gendarmerie in Persia, passed through Baghdad at the beginning of May on his way from Bushehr to Tehran via Kirmanshah. He is a man of extraordinary stature, but he does not seem to have learned much Persian or to be very well able to look after himself when travelling. He was in Baghdad for some time before discovering that there was a Swedish Consul there, and mean while he had taken up his abode with the Persian Consul-General, an arrangement which cannot have been comfortable for either host or guest. The Mukarram- us-Sultan and he came to see me together on the 2nd May, and I invited them both to dinner, but no date could be arranged. Colonel Hjalmarson was accompanied by Captain Klein, the German Military Attache at Tehran. 2. The Persian stages of the Baghdad-Kirmanshah trade route have been somewhat safer of late, but heavy rahdari is being extorted in an arbitrary and uncertain manner from caravans. 3. The Foreign Secretary of the Wilayat, Qudrat Bey, has been stretching forth his hand to vex Persian subjects of late, and the Persian community complain that their own Consul-General, the Mukarram-us-Sultan, is in league wdth him, the function of the former being to claim Persians as Turkish subjects and of the latter to arrange for bribes and divide them with his ally. The chief cause of trouble is disputed nationality, and the claims of the Wilayat appear to be the same j tSee Summary for May 1912 , vi—6. their cases of the same kind with us : viz., that the only admissible evidence of foreign nationality is a foreign passport brought from abroad, that a Consular cer tificate of nationality is not enough, and that the ultimate decision as to nationality rests with the Ottoman authorities, the Consular officer having no voice in the mat ter. Attempts are being made to get the Mukarram-us-Sultan removed on account of his indifference. VI.— Foreign Interests (other than British and Persian). 1. Messrs. Wonckhaus’s agency at Baghdad has been opened by a Mr. Bohn- storff. It is understood that the new agency will take over the representation of the Hamburg-Amerika line from the German firm of Berk, Piittmann and Com pany, and that of the Mannheim Insurance Office from the British firm of Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company.12 , , 2 - 1 determine what is going on about the Baghdad-Samarrah section of the Baghdad Railway. Even the staff seem to make contradictory statements on the subject. I am inclined to think the work is still practically at a standstill. VII. —General and Miscellaneous. 1. Summer is now well begun, and temperatures of 110°, 111°, 112° and 113° m the shade have been registered during the last fortnight on different days. J. G.

The pay of the troops and the salaries of the civil officials here for the Turkish month of April are now about a fortnight in arrear. The Gendarmerie and Police, however, have been paid punctually, as usual, berhaps because discon tent among them would have more immediate bad results. 3. The Gendarmerie and Police Reorganisation f Commission under Lutfi t See test Summary, I, 8. Bey Assistant Wall, have returned to Baghdad after visiting Nasiriyah as well asr Basrah. The President wished to return from Nasiriyah to Baghdad via the 8hatt-al-Gharaf and Kut, but could not do so. He says that the difficulty was want of water, not the state of the tribes in that disturbed neighbourhood. 4. Muhammad Zaki Pasha’s resignation of the Waliship of Baghdad and the Inspectorship-General of the Musal and Baghdad Army Corps having been accept ed, he made over charge of the Vilayat on 13th May to Lutfi Bey, the Assistant Wali, and left on the 24th for Constantinople via the Euphrates and Aleppo. Not withstanding my remarks last month as to the undesirability of a change at such a juncture, I took no action, it being apparent that foreign protests were unlikely to serve any useful purpose. My French colleague did not again raise the question of supporting the Wali, probably because the Oriental Christians of Baghdad had recovered confidence and were no longer troubling him. Some notables of Baghdad telegraphed to Constantinople to urge that the Wall’s resig nation should not be accepted. - 1 On the recommendation of Muhammad Zaki Pasha, the officer appointed to succeed him in the military Inspectorship-General was Muhammad Fazil Pasha, Daghistani, who was understood to }5ee Summary for July 1910, V, have retired j {rom the service j n 191()&gt; but who, as a landed proprietor and an ex-Mushir, has continued to play a large part in public affairs at Baghdad.

In answer to telegrams from Baghdad he professes to have no information on the subject, and it is stated that in any case he cannot leave Diyarbakr, of which he is now Wali, until a successor to him has arrived there. Telegrams have been sent from Baghdad to the Porte protesting against Jalal Bey’s appointment. According to another account, it is Hazim Bey, who was Wali of Baghdad some years ago, that will come to Baghdad, and Jalal Bey will take his place in Syria. 5 5. The new permanent Wali || of Basrah, A’la-ud-Din Bey, arrived there „ „ , A „ T by a Russian steamer on the 2nd May. \] See last Summary, I, 10. His appointment was not intimated to the local authorities before his arrival, and the Porte may have intended that he should appear unexpectedly on the scene, but the news had leaked out long before he came. The Farman of the new Wali was read at the Sarai on the 10th May. „ „ 0 ™ v 1010 P a The acting Wali% ’Ali Riza Pasha, seems «[ Summary for March 1913, P. S. ° . ’ to have left a few days later by sea for his home at Damascus, saying that he intended to retire from the service. His action CI70FD\ caused some surprise at Baghdad, where the Inspector-General of the Army Corps desired his presence. There can be no doubt that, on account of the Arab nation alist movement, the position of Arab functionaries of the Turkish Government in Arab provinces is at the present moment an exceedingly unpleasant one. 6. The amount of official recognition lately conceded* to the Arabic language ♦See last Summary, l f 3. in Mesopotamia does not satisfy the “Mis- bah ” of Baghdad, which claims that Arabic should be the sole official language in this part of the Empire and that only Arabs should be employed in the local administration. From articles in the Tur kish Press of Constantinople, it may be gathered. 1 think, that the present con cessions to Arabic are made in a hypocritical spirit and will be left a dead letter, or even revoked afterwards, if the exigencies of polities admit. 7. Apparently to meet a supposed need for administrative decentralisation, a new law regarding the constitution of Wilayats has been promulgated and is now being carried into effect at Baghdad and Basrah. I am as yet without exact information as to the origin and terms of this lawf ; but whatever these may be, it is clear that the law is regarded in different lights by the governors and the governed in Mesopotamia. The object of the Turkish administration seems to be to concede an appearance of self-government to the inhabitants of the province bv con stituting an elective General Council for each Wilayat, at the same time reserv ing all real power to the VY T ah, who will of course continue to act under instruc tions from the Porte. The object of the Arabs is, naturally, to obtain for themselves some practical control or influence over the administration. This law has furnished the first opportunity for a trial of strength between the Turkish Government and the Arab nationalists of Basrah, a trial which cannot be said to be concluded as yet. t It may perhaps be a new section, or a revised section, of the Wilayat Law of which a part was promulgated last year. If a revision, it should probably be attributed to recent events in Syria. It is spoken of as “ muwaqqat ” or temporary. The native newspapers here seem to have got hold of some of the provisions, but it is doubtful whether the Wilayat even has a copy of the text. The W ilayat Law of last year is supposed to be in force, but its financial provisions at least have not been carried into practice. On the night of the 26th-27th April, the Basrah-Constantinople wire was monopolised by protestors against the more autocratic provisions of the law, who demanded modifications. Their action was no doubt organised by SaiyidJ Talib, and perhaps the most interesting ques- } See last Summary, I, 3. ^ com]Lec ti on &lt;w ith the Basrah agita tions is to what extent they have been fomented by that wily Naqibzadah or how far they are spontaneous and might have occurred without him. The Minister of the Interior declined to yield to the protests; and the Arab notables of Basrah, on the Minister’s reply being read to them at the Serai by the Acting Wali, re fused to take the necessary steps for electing the new General Council. A refe rence was made by the Acting Wali to Constantinople, but the Minister of the Interior only answered that the law was working well in other Wilayats and must be applied in its present form at Basrah, though it might perhaps be altered at some future date by the Turkish Parliament. On the 28th May, Saiyid Talib hinted to Mr. Crow, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, that the Arabs might use force to carry their point and that the leaders might be unable to prevent misbehaviour on the part of the criminal and lower classes of the population, if an actual conflict were to occur. Mr. Crow, accordingly, suggested that a ship of war might be sent to Basrah to protect British subjects and interests, and on the 4th May H. M. S. “Alert ” arrived there. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, the new Wali had arrived at Basrah ; and, even before that, information had reached me at Baghdad that the Turkish Gov ernment were endeavouring to placatt Saiyid Talib and induce him to withdraw his opposition. On the 4th of May, the Wali assured Saiyid Talib that he would do the best he could, within the limits of the new law, to meet the wishes of the Arabs ; and on the 6th he told the Saiyid that he had r( ferred the question to Constantinople. He also promised that Farid Bey, who was being sent from Baghdad to command the Basrah Nizam Division, and who is a Turkish chauvinist, would not be allowed to interfere in ncn-military affairsThere had been trouble at Zubair on the 4th May; but the disturbers of the peace, though apparently the same as on the * See last Summary I, 3. former occasion*, seem this time to have .acted in a sense hostile to the Turks by upsetting the Government’s arrange ments for watch and ward of the town and substituting others of their own. The civil Mudir having reported that his life was in danger, a commission of staff officers and 50 soldiers were sent from Basrah and the movement collapsed. For some days the party headed by Saiyid Talib maintained a determined attitude, and, on the 9th May, it was still felt that an attempt by the Government to apply the new law might provoke armed resistance. Presently, however, a new factor appeared on the scene, and the attitude of Saiyid Talib began to weaken. This new factor was ’Ajaimi, Chief of the Muntafik, who had for some time been addressing boastful letters to persons at Basrah, in which he ^aid that he understood there were intrigues at Basrah against the Turkish Government and that he was coming to punish the intriguers. On the 8th May 'Ajaimi, whose feud with the Dhafir tribe is said at Baghdad to have been settled before his departure from his own country by the Qaim-Maqam of Samawah, had reached a point only some 30 miles from Basrah ; and his approach seemed to disquiet both the Wali and Saiyid Talib. By the 12th May, Saiyid Talib’s tone had changed and he had begun to de clare that he found the new Wali conciliatory and that the demands of the Arabs would be pressed with moderation. ’Ajaimi continued to draw nearer and nearer to Basrah, the Wali appeared uncertain how to act, and Saiyid Talib grew more and more anxious. On the 17th May, when Mr. Crow and the officers of H. M. S. “ Alert” dined with Saiyid Talib, they found his house full of armed men, some of whom had been lent him by the Shaikh of Muhammerah; and the Saiyid informed Mr. Crow that the Wali had left it to him to employ the force of which he disposed, if he thought it necessary, for protecting Basrah against the Muntafik. Saiyid Talib feared, or affected to fear, a raid by the Muntafik on the town of Basrah but he said that he could bring together 30,000 armed men (sic) to repel one. His anxiety seemed to have reference, in a large measure, to his own personal safety. By the 18th of May, ’Ajaimi had reached a place only an hour distant from Basrah and the Wali was in communication with him as well as with Saiyid Talib. Perhaps mindful of his father’s fatef, ’Ajaimi declined to enter Basrah, but the Mudir of Police went to visit him on the Wall’s behalf and returned with a letter. After touch had thus been establish ed, the Wali seemed disposed to recommend that a decoration and an allowance should be granted to ’Ajaimi by the Govern ment, but the notables of Basrah protested against the impolicy of rewarding him for what they regarded as a disloyal demonstration. At Baghdad I have received the impression that Saiyid Talib’s affairs—in spite of his family’s wealth, influence and sacred character and of his own cleverness, knowledge of the world and partly English education—are unlikely to make much headway. Without the support of the Shaikhs of the Arab tribes he can do little ; and, though some of the Shaikhs might come together under his auspices temporarily, it is not likely that the more important among them would long obey him or even respect his wishes. In his dreams the Saiyid may have seen himself with a sceptre in his hand, but in his waking movements he must realise that there are more powerful men in the country than himself, such as ’Ajaimi, who are just as ready to grasp a sceptre as he is. It remains to be seen how far this Baghdad appreciation of the Basrah position is correct. If there is anything in it the Turks should not find it difficult to hold their own at Basrah by playing off Shaikhs against Saiyids and one Shaikh against another. 8. Perhaps more important and more permanent in its results than the present agitation at Basrah is the expulsion of the Turks by Ibn Sa’ud, Amir of Southern Najd, from the province of Hasa, which was annexed to the Ottoman Empire in 1871 when Midhat Pasha ruled Mesopotamia. Ibn Sa’ud entered Hofuf on the 5th May, probably not without the help, or at least the con nivance, of the inhabitants of the town and surrounding villages. The Turkish official reports indicate that a stout resistance was ofiered, but the Arab accounts are to a different effect, and, regard being had to the fact that the Turkish ■f See Summary for December 1911, I, 1; for October 1911, I, 2 ; for July 1911, I, 1 ; etc. (Sa’dun Pasha was decoyed into the power of the Turks at Basrah through Saiyid Talib).4 troops themselves must have been mostly Arabs, the latter must be regarded as the more probably true. The port of Qatif surrendered to Ibn Sa’ud on the 15th of Alay, and before then the Mutasarrif of Hasa had already come down to the coast at Oqair with the civil officials of the Sanjaq and the military garrison Most of these events were reported by the British Political Agent in Bahrain to the Pol tical Kesident in the Persian Gulf under date 12th May, and were telegraphed by the latter on the 14th to His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah, who informed Constantinople and Baghdad. The first authentic news of the occurrence reached the \V ah of Basrah from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, and the Acting Wali or Baghdad sought information from me on the subject. On the 17th May Saivid lahb received letters from Ibn Sa’ud. The latter represented himself as a loyal Ottoman, and assigned misgovernment by the local Turkish officials and their fail ure to pay an allowance granted him by the Porte as his reasons for “resuming direct administration of Hasa. He enclosed a letter for the Wali of Basrah, the delivery or non-delivery of which was left to Saiyid Talib’s discretion. On the 18th May the steamer “John 0. Scott” arrived at Bahrain with a number of the expelled lurkish troops, variously estimated at 300 to 600 men, from ’Oqair and Qatif The amputation of the Sanjaq of Hasa from the Ottoman dominions, whether temporary or permanent, makes a profound difference in the politics of the Persian Gu f, whjch only those who have had to do with the affairs of that region can fully appreciate. For one thing it throws open for trade and political intercourse the shortest line connecting the outer world with Central Arabia, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah thinks that the event will have a repercussive effect in Meso potamia What hne^ the Turks will take in the matter is stijl uncertain. On the one hand, the W ah of Basrah professes to think immediate action impossible ; on the other a quantity of Turkish Government ammunition was consigned from Basrah to Bahram in the British steamer “Baroda” on the 20th May, no doubt for the use troo P s stl 1 11 remaining on the Hasa coast. Previously to this, on the 16th May, 140 recruits belonging to the Baghdad and Basrah Army Corps had been embarked at Basrah on the Russian styamer “Yesta,” their declared destina- mn bemg Hodaidah. The Yaman Division, it will be remembered, is included in the military Inspectorship-General of Musal and Baghdad. 9. The Basrah troubles and Hasa disaster have occasioned some military move- ‘ ments in Mesopotamia. On the 7th May, troops said to number 600 left Baghdad by river. They were said to be for Yaman, but their real objective was believed to be the nearer one of Basrah. They may have been identical, in whole or part with the alleged recruits who were said to have left Basrah for the Red Sea on the 16th May. About 150 infantry, stated to be part of the ’Amarah garrison reached Basrah by steamer on the night of the 21st May, for duty there. In the early morn mg of the 27th May, the Turkish steamer “Musal” passed this Residency downwards carrying troops ; it appeared from subsequent enquiry that they were a composite battalion 400 strong (to me they appeared less) formed, according to the time! honoured Turkish plan on such occasions, of drafts from various units. The British representative at Basrah and in Bahrain will no doubt keep Gov- ernment informed^ of all Turkish military movements extending to the Persian Gulf At Baghdad, it is impossible to ascertain anything of importance, the scene of action being distant The Baghdad troops, mostly Arabs, are very unwilling I understand, to go south to fight for the Turks against other Arabs. Should thev retuse to go, there will be no means of coercing them at hand. If the close of the war leaves Turkey with an army in excess of her requirements in the west —and it is thought that any attempt at a serious reduction of the army might be attended with political danger on account of the concurrent reduction of offi- cers, Anatolian Turkish battalions may perhaps be sent to Mesopotamia before j if would revolutionise all the local administrative conditions. The Baghdad Railway will in any case bring some such revolution about, tardily perhaps but certainly. The Turk will be untrue to his character if government with the high hand does not then take the place of that Government by consent which has been traditional here. I I p to the 21st May, the strength of the Turkish regular garrison from Basrah to the Persian Gulf was understood to be only 300 rifles, of which 160 were at Basrah. In consequence of the arrival of the detachment from ’Amarah on thatdate, and of the addition of the troops expelled from Hasa and the composite batta lion despatched from Baghdad on the 27th May, the garrison at Basrah should now be sufficient, if loyalty to the Government is maintained, to meet all local eventualities. The greatest danger is probably that of distrubances being caused on the Tigris by the Bani Lam, A1 Bu Muhammad, etc., and this is unfortunately just what would cause most inconvenience to British interests. 10. Turkish cruiser “ Hamidieh ” is stated by the Turkish authorities at Basrah, on the authority of the Minister of the Interior, to have left Aden recently for Basrah. From the energy shown by this ship in the Mediterranean it is con jectured at Baghdad that there must be a European officer on board of her. I have no book of reference at hand making it possible to determine whether she could cross the bar of the Shatt-al-Arab ; if not, her voyage to the East will be of little use. Enquiries have been made by the Turkish authorities when the Turkish gunboat “ Marmaris ” will be able to return to Basrah from Bombay, where she had been sent for repairs. The reply of the Turkish Consul-General at Bombay to the Commodore at Basrah seems to have been that a bill of Rs. 90,000 for repairs had to be paid before she could leave Bombay. 11. In the course of the past month the Turkish mail from Baghdad to Europe via Aleppo received the designation of “ the Tartar Post,” and the day of departure was altered from Friday to Saturday. The mail by Musal and Diyarbakr was hitherto “ the Tartar Post,” and the change is perhaps meant to mark the transfer of importance which has taken place from the old route to the new one in the course of a generation. 12. Of Musal affairs there is nothing to report except that unrest and disquiet appear to be general in the Wilayat, though so far without giving rise to violent practical manifestations. II. —British Interests and Cases. 1. Mr. Hogarth’ 1 ' lodged with the Acting Wali by due date the principal plans ' * See last Summary, n, 7 . an( ^ specifications for the Baghdad Tram- . no t n/r ways, the period allowed for the preparation of which expired on the 28th May. Some supplementary papers have still to be submitted, but an extension of time for all had been obtained in advance by the Syndicate’s represenative at Constantinople. Mr. Hogarth reports that he had an excellent reception from Lutfi Bey and that the Baghdad Municipality have since intimated their concurrence in all his proposals. This is how most enter prises begin in Turkey, and it is no guarantee against difficulties in the later stages. 2. Mr. Holme’s venture as a tailor at Baghdad has not been successful and latterly there was trouble between him and his native partner. Mr. Holmes’lived in fair comfort while he was here, and out of the capital that he put into the bus : - ness, which was much less than the £500 reported, he recovered £60 before going av ay. His wife earned on a separate and apparently not unprosperous business as a milliner. Efforts were made by local Jewish capitalists to obtain the services of Mr. and Mrs. Holmes for enterprises, the possibility of which at Baghdad has been proved by Holmes, Bahoshy and Co.’s experiment, and I do not feel sure that the couple will not return to Baghdad. They are going to pass the summer at least in England. 3. It is not clear that the Baghdad Railway Materials Transport Syndicate'!', t See Summary for July 1912 , VI, i. 2° w known a s the “ Societe de Transports Jluviaux en Orient, is yet in working order. The coming mto force of the agreement between the Baghdad Railway Company and Messrs. Lynch is said to be delayed pending the completion of the Societe s fleet • but towards the end of May one of their tugs (the “ Shirin ”) was running, another (the “ Sheytan ”) had been launched from Messrs. Lynch’s dock at Magil, a third (the “Shihab ”) was ready for launching there, and a fourth (the “ Shuhrur ”) had been laid down, while the materials of a fifth were expected shortly from Europe Ten barges had been put together at Messrs. Lynch’s yard, and eight remained to be built. Meanwhile, the railway materials, which have been arriving in very small quantities of late, have been forwarded from Basrah to Baffiidad bvtuas C170FD ° y g * rbarges and steamers belonging to various owners. There seems no doubt that Mr. Tod, Messrs. Lynch’s chief representative in Mesopotamia, will be regarded and treated as the manager of the joint operations, if he is not in fact already con ducting the present ones. 4. Having noticed in the Foreign Office confidential blue prints, which are sent me every week, that it was beingassum ed in some quarters, in connection with general arrangement between Britain and Turkey in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf, that British rights of river navigation in this country depended on the Farman of 1834 granted in favour of the Chesney Expedition, 1 telegraphed immediately, on the 25th May, to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, stating the facts of the case as known to me from recent researches at Simla, and pointing out the danger of our relying on the Farman in question. 5. In its issue of the 6th May the “ Nawadir ” newspaper of Baghdad stated that the British representative at Kuwait recently visited Majma’ah in Sadair, Central Arabia ; that he wished to enter the town, but that the inhabitants prevented his doing so ; and that he then sent presents, including a watch and binocular, to Amir ’Abdullah-al-’Askar, by whom he was brought inside. The editor continues. “ The Consul next ascended Marqab and took photographs. Afterwards he went to ’ Abdul ’Aziz-as-Sa’ud and had an interview with him in Khafs. The Consul said that he wished to buy the country from him, but this proposal was declined by ’Abdul ’Aziz.” It may amuse Captain Shakespear to know that his movements are followed even at Baghdad and what garbled accounts of them are given ! 6. Falih-bin-Banaiyah*, brother of Ghadhban, the principal Shaikh of the Bani Lam, has been for some time endeavour- • * Hl ® n J me ^ be added to tjv 6 ta b le g iven ing to attract the sympathy of His Britannic Majesty s Consul at Basrah to the side of his brother’s Arabs in their differences with the Turkish Government. 7. The chronic nervousness of local chauvinists about British designs in Meso- + See last Summary, I, 5. potamia continues to be more than usually pronounced| at the present time. Salah-ud- I Din, Kirkukli, the Jupiter Tonans of the local “ Zuhur,” writes in the issue of the 26th of May that the carelessness of the Ottoman Government and the steady in crease of British political influence in this country make everyone think that ’Iraq will one day be British territory. III.- British Indian Interests and Cases. 1. Before I had received a replyt from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador t See last Summary, 111 , 1 . at Constantinople in the case of Hukmi, sen of Hallo, I was invited by the President oi the Court to send a Dragoman to b e present at his trial. I replied that I could not do so as the disposal of Hukmi was still under discussion between myself and the Wilayat. At Constantinople, the preliminary delivery of Hukmi to this Consulate-Gene ral and fresh proceedings in his case were demanded by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, who was successful in obtaining the issue of telegraphic orders by the Ministryof Justice for an immediate report on the case to be made by the Procureur- General of Appeal at Baghdad, and who at the same time (14th May) instructed me to endeavour to influence that official to report in a favourable sense. The Procu- reur-General was absent from Baghdad, and I had to be content with an interview with his Assistant instead, which took place on the 17th May. I found this Assistant, on whom it appeared that the duty of reporting would devolve, had his mind already made up and was deaf to all argument. He said that he could not recommend the preliminary surrender of Hukmi, because it would be contrary (1) to Turkish law in general, and (2) to the instructions of the Foreign Min ster in this particular case. It was equally impossible for him to suggest fresh proceedings against the prisoner, because such proceedings would be illegal; not even the Minister of Justice himself could order a repetition of proceedings already held. (It is remarkable how sacrosanct the law is to an Ottoman official, who has a prac tical point to gain by it, and how little it counts for with him in other cases). Ifound it useless to urge that foreign subjects have certain rights in Turkey and that the internal law of the country should be worked in such a way as not to infringe them. The Assistant Procureur-General then informed me that personally he considered Hukmi to be guilty of the attempted burglary with which he was charg ed, that the man’s trial was now going on without the presence of a Dragoman, and that the prisoner had “practically” confessed his guilt. On this I asked for an interview with Hukhi in the presence of the Assistant Public Prosecutor, and one was arranged for the next day (18th May). At this interview the prisoner, a manly young fellow whose bearing made a favourable impression on me, told a long, detailed, and perfectly consistent story which amounted not to a “practical” confession, but to a serious indictment against the authorities. His statement, briefly, was that he had incautiously shown a gold watch to an Arab who entered into conversation with him at a tea shop ; that he had been wakened at night by a noise on the roof of his lodging and went to see what the cause of it was ; that on doing so he was suddenly attacked, tied, dragged across inter vening roofs to the roof of a shop, where he was beaten till he temporarily lost con sciousness ; that when he came to he was handed over by his principal assailant to the police on the allegation that he had been found trying to enter the shop mentioned from above ; that he then found his gold watch gone, as also eight English sovereigns which he had in his pocket; and finally that he recognised in the night-watchman, who handed him over to the police, the Arab who had seen his watch in the tea-shop. The fact that the police, etc., denied that any certificate of nationality was found in Hukmi’s possession or among his effects, whereas the man undoubtedly registered himself at Basrah last November, combined with the fact that a stranger in a town was unlikely to become implicated in a burglary there within a few hours, as it appeared, of his arrival, gave ground for suspicions which there was nothing in the notorious character of the night-watchmen or police of Kadhimain to allay. I, therefore, telegraphed the fresh information obtained to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador and added that I suspected foul play. The Assistant Procureur- General said that the conclusion of Hukmi’s trial could not be postponed, as I re- * A British Indian now employed as a lasted to allow of my communicating servant in this Residency was years in a With the Embassy, for it Was a moral Turkish jail on a charge of murder, of which duty* strongly incumbent on criminal “ British 1 rr “„u,d B havf ?'Z courts to dispo S e of the cases of the prisoners ferred expedition, whereas in the present one before them as rapidly as possible, they were asking for a few days’ delay. On the 27th May I was informed, and the news proved to be true, that Hukmi had been acquitted by the Court along with a Turkish subject, who was tried jointly with him. I have little doubt that, notwithstanding the greater inviolability of justice in Turkey than in other countries, the acquittal took place under instructions from Constantinople, the object being to evade the British demand for preliminary surrender of the prisoner and holding of the proceedings de novo. I am now endeavouring to have Hukmi’s watch traced, which he says was of an unusual shape ; and I propose, in any case, now that the man has been acquitted, to ask the Acting Wali to have his allegations against the Kadhimain night-police strictly investigated. I have given the facts above somewhat at length as illustrating one of the staple branches of Residency business here, and also incidentally Turkish official character. IV.— British Official Matters. 1. Mr. Catort, the Judge of His Britannic Majesty’s Supreme Court for the Dominions of the Sublime Ottoman Porte, t See last Summary, , . w ho is on his way from Constantinople to Baghdad to try the prisoner Joynes, left Jerabluson the Euphrates by water on the 22nd May.

As I expected*, the success of the Oudh Bequest distribution, which was * 0 , . „ TV 0 completed no less auspiciously at Naiaf * See last Summary, IV, 2. , i r i i i -j. j A. 4.1 r than at Karbala has excited the wrath of the Zuhur. In the number of 23rd May a writer signing himself “ Muslim ” argued that the Turkish Government should have the same rights of supervision over the Oudh Bequest as those exercised by the British Government, and urged that the establishment of anything in the nature of schools, hospitals, etc., by means of the Bequest should be resisted. In the number of the 26th May the same writer called upon the heirs of the late King of Oudh to oppose the present system of dis tribution and to see that the intentions of the King were executed. The “ Muslim ° in question may be a disappointed Persian Mujtahid, or the mouth-piece of one. 3. The tour to Samarra which I contemplated! last month was successfully car ried out in May, and was the occasion of the t See last Summary, IV, 4. Residency motor boat making her longest voyage to date. The distance proved to be about 125 miles by river and there was an average current of about 3 miles an hour against her. On the first day (7th May) she ran for 12 hours, excluding a half hour halt about noon, and stopped for the night at Sindiyah, where I put up on shore with Mahmud Beg, a retired cavalry officer living on his estate. The running hours of the second day were similar, and in the evening I reached Istabalat; here Mr. Anton, a German engineer of the Baghdad Railway gave me shelter in his camp for the night. The alluvial country had now been left behind, and it took 3 hours tD reach Samarra the next day against a strong current racing downhill under conglomerate cliffs where a failure of the engine tnight have had inconvenient consequences. As one point the launch remained almost motionless for some minutes, the velocity of the current being nearly as great as her own speed (8 knots). On the afternoon and evening of my arrival (9th May) I interviewed British Indian subjects, visited Dr. Herzfeld’s excavations' at the palace of the Khalifahs, which are about to be closed, and dined with him at his house in the town. After dinner Professor Sarre, another German scholar, arrived from Baghdad with an as sistant. Next day ( 10 th May) I visited the Qaim-Maqam, Yusuf Effendi, the same who expelled the Oudh Bequest Pilgrim Guide last year, I was glad to find that , ™ ttt 7 the Pilgrim Guide at Samarra is newt X See Summary or ay ’ well treated, and that he is able, in spite of his having no official position to transact all necessary business of British sub- i jects satisfactorily on their behalf with the local authorities. During my short stay at Samarra 30 Indian pilgrims arrived there and I was able to realise some of the difficulties of the Guide in meeting them on the other side of the broad river, bringing them across, and finding them billets in the town, all in the teeth of extortion. I lunched with Mustafa Bey de Courten and Rushdi Bey of the Baghdad Railway, two of Sir William Willcocks’ former engineers whom I in troduced to Meissner Pasha in 1911 and whom he immediately employed. Mus tafa Bey is “ Chef ” of a “ Brigade ” and he and his companion are living in some of the buildings of the Samarra railway station which have already been erected on the west side of the river at about 2 miles distance inland. The motor boat got under way for the return journey at 2-15 p. m ., and 1-15, a.m., the next morning (11th May) she stopped at the Residency stairs, having run for 11 hours continuously without a moment’s halt. The most risky part of the journey was perhaps the shooting of the Mu’adhdham and Baghdad boat-bridges after midnight by the light, in each case, of a lantern held by a watchman over the middle of a space between two pontoons.

A representative of the German firm of W onckhaus, already well known ! at Basrah and in the Persian Gulf, has arrived at Baghdad and will immediately open a branch here. I learn from the Gulf that a director of the Hamburg-Amerika Steam Navigation Company, with which the firm of Wonckhaus is understood to have special relations, is expected shortly to visit this part of the world. 3v I learn from a reliable source that the German Government has at f length t See Summary for March-April 1912, VII 7. R plot of land in Baghdad on . i • i • ’ which they will build a Consulate, no onger leaving their representative at the mercy of extortionate native land lords. Ihe site is on the west bank of the Tigris about the middle of the town a little way above the present Baghdad Railway offices ; the land actually secured as yet is not extensive, but I understood that it is hoped to add to it by treaty with neighbours. I hope this action means that the Germans have made up their minds about their position in Mesopotamia and have realised that, for some time to come at any rate, it can only be a secondary one. 4. About the middle 6f May a new German Vice-Consul arrived at Musal in the person of a Mr. Holstein. 5. Mr. A. Orloff, the Russian Consul-General at Baghdad with whom I have lived and worked on terms of the greatest amity for more than three years, start ed for Russia on leave on the 18th of May. He may return in autumn, but he hopes to get employment at home on a committee for revising the Russian law that corresponds to our Ottoman Order in Council. He travelled by the Persian overland route, and I saw him off at the North Gate. He had told me already that he meant to travel pretty extensively in ZohabJ, probably diverging t te last Summary v, 4. ^ main road 'ds before reach- mg Khanaqm so as to avoid difficulties with the Turks ; to have a meeting with Mr. Soane at Chia Surkh ; and to leave the disputed tract by its northern end. Mr. Popoff, the Russian Vice-Consul, is acting for him. 6. The Zu/mr newspaper, which regards itself as the scourge of the foreign intruder in Mesopotamia, has lately turned its attention to the French. The editor (Salah-ud-Din, Kirkukli) apparently wished to visit the Carmelite School at Baghdad and was told that he could not do so until he had obtained permission from the French Consul. In revenge he has devoted a couple of articles t° the French nation, the second of which concludes with an admonition to his fellow-countrymen “ to feel disguised towards the French.” 7. Mr. V iet, French Consul at Baghdad for the last three years, left for Syria and Europe via Aleppo on the 27th May. He also has been a pleasant colleague to work with. Like Mr. Orloff he may return in autumn, but his doing so is uncertain. His substitute is Mr. Dozon, a French Vice-Consul from elsewhere.

The situation is anxious and discouraging for those who compose or * His Highness Agha Khan of Bombay has been recommending this loan as a good safe in vestment for Indian Muhammadans because Turkish stock bearing 4 per cent interest stands at 84. But I think the latter statement can onl y be true of the Turkish securities for which revenues have been assigned and placed under European management, and I hope that many poor Indians mav not su^er by misplac ed confidence in the Turkish Ministry of Finance. The Turkish public, who should know best, do not seem to have any confidence in the bonds as an investment. sympathise with the Turkish administra tion. Subscriptions to the Turkish* inter nal loan come in very slowly, in fact subscriptions seem to have ceased, and the (British) Eastern Bank at Baghdad which agreed to help in the matter has not received any applications for bonds. Offi cial salaries for March were not paid until they had become about a fortnight over due, and then only under special orders from Constantinople. In the interim the Turkish Qaim-Maqam of Fao is said f to have tried to borrow money from the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2. Arab feeling does not appear excited at present, except at Basrah, but everywhere disgust with the past and pessimism as regards the future seem to weigh upon the people. The more intelligent among the Arabs cannot really, I should think, imagine that they would be able to govern themselves better than the Turks govern them ; for, fov the moment, dissatisfaction with the ruling race, or even contempt of it, is what is uppermost in many minds. There are various indications of unrest, but those at Baghdad are not serious so far. Seditious manifestoes and literature from Basrah and Constantinople are in circulation and the prosecution of a Turkish subject who is charged with distribution of some of them has been begun ; but these productions, while they afford much food for political gossip, do not seem to influence opinion. More significant is an incipient coldness which is reported between the Turkish and Arab officers of the 13th Army Corps and the Turkish and Arab civil officials of the Wilayat. 3. At Basrah events have gone faster than elsewhere. On the 23rd April a deputation of notables, organised but not accompanied by Saiyid Talib, the Arab nationalist leader, waited on the Acting Wali, himself an Arab, and de manded the dismissal of certain officers of the Gendarmerie. These officers were accused of dereliction of duty and abuse of power, and a lamentable insecurity now prevailing at Basrah was attributed to their bad conduct. Their real offence, however, seems to have lain in their political opinions and in the foundation by . r r , . ... .. „ ~, Wf them of a secret “ Namus-ile-Quvvet ” or t The name suggests that it was an oitshoct . of the “Committee of Union and Progress”, T OrCC With Honour J Society. Ihe Act- whose worship of force has tainted many youth- ing Wali replied that he COuld not Submit ful minds m Turkey since 1909. to an ultimatum and must have time to refer to Constantinople. It was granted him. Simultaneously with this occurrence, or immediately after, a noisy demon stration took place at Zubair near Basrah. No very clear explanation of it is forth coming, but there is some reason for thinking that it was got up by enemies of Saiyid Talib to distract attention from the complaint against the Gendarmerie officers. If so the occurrence may be taken as an illustration of what would happen if .Arab autonomy were ever established at Basrah. It is reported with regard to various tracts, especially Hindiyah, Diwaniyah, Muntafik and ’Amarah, that the Arab tribes are conspiring to pay no revenue to the Government this year ; and traders are afraid of an outbreak of Arab law lessness at Shatrah in Munh.fik, which was temporarily captured by tribesmen in 1910. The movement in Hindiyah seems to have taken a definite shape and to have caused some anxiety to the Turkish officials among whom there has been correspondence about it. The Hindiyah tribes are said to have demanded the removal, among others, of the Daftardar of Baghdad, who is one of the leading representatives of the Committee of Union and Progress remaining in the Wilayat. C. 124 FDIf the Government insist on trying to collect the tribal revenues this year there will probably be trouble, but some of the local officials most in touch with the people are in favour of conciliation. One important concession has just been made to Arab sentiment. A circular has been received from the Ministry of the Interior directing that in provinces where Arabs form a majority of the population the medium of instruction in the schools shall be Arabic, Turkish, however, remaining a compulsory subject, and that in the Courts of justice and public offices the use of Arabic shall be allowed, 4. The attitude of some of the northern Kurdish chiefs is one which cannot be satisfactory to the Porte. A movement in favour of Kurdish autonomy has been set on foot by Husain Pasha, Badarkhanzadah, of Jazirah, Saiyid Tahir, and 'Abdur Razzaq Bey; and the brother of the first-named, perhaps for this reason, has been suddenly transferred from the Maktubjiship of Musal to the Mutasarrifship of Taiz in Yaman. Mr. Hony, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at Musal, does not anticipate any great development of the Kurdish movement at present; and from what I have seen of Mahmud Pasha, chief of the Jaf, I should be surprised, though he too seems affected by the wave of depreciation of things Ottoman which is passing over the country, if that great tribe were to take any decided line. 5. The attitude of the local nationalists towards Britain is one expectant of support; but it would be criminal to show, and probably foolish to feel, any sympathy with their vague and ill-considered ideas. One or two promoters of the movement have made overtures for interviews with me, but I have dis couraged them. I notice, however, that there is an increasing disposition on the part of leading men, including those who are not concerned in aw^-Turkish move ments, to visit and talk freely to me ; and this is a decided advantage. An interesting acquintanceship that I have lately made is that of Yusuf Effendi, Suwaidizadah, an er-official and a native of Baghdad, who claims descent from the ’Abbaside Khalifahs. One of his sons has been Qaim-Maqam for more than a year of Najaf, where he is much beloved by the people*; another has just been appointed Qaim-Maqam of Kadhimain ; a third is studying at Paris ; and a fourth, who has finished his education at Constantinople, is now attached to the Wilayat offices. The first, Naji Bey, has been studying English at Najaf with the help of an Indian, and Major Scott, the Assistant-Resident, who saw him there lately, reports that he has done so to good purpose ; this may be regarded as a sign of the times. The Suwaidizadahs are much trusted by the Government, but the head of the family is as despondent about Turkish rule in Traq as anyone that I have met. Some of the seditious literature being imported at Baghdad is undoubtedly coming in through the British Post Office. The Wali, however, has said nothing to me on the subject; nor do I see that it would be possible to open parcels or letters with a view to confiscating the contents, if found objectionable. The British Postmaster was lately summoned as a witness to prove the place of origin— it was Constantinople—of some obnoxious papers lately distributed at Baghdad,, and I at once sent him to give evidence. All sorts of wild rumours are current, of course. It is said that Britain is lend ing £45,000,000 to Turkey on a mortgage of the Wilayats of Baghdad, Basrah and Musal, that the British are about to receive important navigation concessions on the Tigris and Euphrates, etc., etc. 6. On the 6th April it came to the knowledge of my Russian colleague (Mr. Orloff) that Fatwas defining the proper attitude of Muhammadans to the Porte at the present juncture had been collected and printed in the Wilayat Printing Press and were about to be issued in the form of a broad-sheet with an objection able unsigned introduction in which Christians were described as “ dogs ” and “ in fidels.” That night Mr. Orloff visited me with the French Consul (Mr. Wiet), bringing a copy of the manifesto. Its real object appeared to be nothing more than to facilitate flotation of the internal Turkish loan. We sent our cards to the Wall’s private house by my Native Agent (Mr. Nersessian), and a reply was re turned that the Wali, who does not know Arabic, would prevent the issue of the3 manifesto if it contained the unparliamentary expressions alleged. Early next morning, however, distribution of the manifesto began, but on a message being sent to the Wali, who had probably been over-reached by some of his subordinates, it was stopped, and the copies that had got abroad were collected so far as possible. The Oriental Christians and Jews of Baghdad knew something about the paper, and its recall from circulation probably alarmed them even more than what they had heard about the contents. On Friday, the 10th, there were rumours of an im pending massacre and a small panic occurred in the bazaar on the morning of that day My French colleague then called on me to propose collective consular ac tion in support of the Wali, whose attitude seemed to be favourable and who was supposed to have tendered his resignation, by recommending the removal from Baghdad of certain Union and Progress officials alleged to be working against him, notably of Muhammad Najati Bey, Proeureur-General of Appeal, It ha.d come to my knowledge that Mr. Orloff was not in relations with the Wilayat on account oUsome acute differences with them, and that Mr. Wiet had had difficulties recently with the Procureur-General, in a case of nationality. T said that three conditions seemed to me indispensable for collective action: first that our German, Austrian and American colleagues should pin with us; second that the Wali should be consulted before we took any action; and, thud, that it should be left to the Wali himself to designate to the Porte the officials whose removal was expedient. In the end it was decided to do nothing immediately, but to watch events; and in the course of a day or two the excitement dmd away There was a slight renewal of it, on one occasion, before the end of the month, 7 The Wali’s position is difficult and weak. Muhammad Zaki Pasha is a Circassian of commanding stature, but he is old and unintelligent. He belongs to the Zmidian regime and he has to work under a Union and Progress Govern ment whose representatives on the spot probably misrepresent his actions at Con- ment wnose P , . resem ki e concessions to foreigners. His wife, whotr^h hTfiold mine that she dislikes Baghdad; and the Wali himself dreads the approkching hot weather. It is not wonderful that he should be trying to escape by resignation or otherwise; and I understand that in present circum stances he would if relieved, se.k a refuge at Pans. He is said to possess large private means. I am altogether at one with my French colleague in thinking thll anv change of Wali before the conclusion of peace, the establishment of more settled conditions, and the arrival of a suitable successor is to be deprecated. The present Wall is a soldier and I am inclined to think that he might rise to the occasion in case of an emergency. The present leaders of the Union and Progress party at Baghdad are tbe Pro- ihepresenr iea (N ■ g ) the Daftardar, the Director of Political cureur Geneial o PP 1 ( a Christian lawyer who finds it to his in- Affairs (Qudrat Bey) ^nd Salah-ud-din, Kirkukli, (edi- terest professiona st jH a ble to embarrass the Wall by the influence tor of the Zuhur ) . 0 f Union and Progress have lost they possess at Cons an ^ ^ Sarai, and they expect to suffer all credit at Baghdad pX and their failure to relieve Ad- later on £or J£«« “X' ” bas more than once attacked the Wall personally, and nanople.

Badi’NuriBey, “ one of the best Turkish writers at Constantinople”, has been appointed Mutasarrif of the troublous Muntafik Sanjaq in this province and has arrived at Baghdad. 10. A new Wali of Basrah has been designated in the person of A’la-ud-Din Bey. formerly Wali of Sivas. He is a native of Homs and a protege of the Com mittee of Union and Progress ; and his difficulties with the Arab nationalists of Basrah are likely to be considerable. 11. Under instructions from Constantinople the 27th April, though the anniver sary of the Sultan’s accession, was not observed as an official holiday. The Wali, however, held a full dress reception at the Sarai, and one salute of 21 guns was fired instead of the usual five. At night the public buildings, the Wali’s house and the Naqib’s house were not illuminated, though the Baghdad railway offices and some other edifices were. The Residency flagstaff and “ Comet ” were dressed during the day, but the illumination after dark was omitted. 12. In spite of political troubles local business is as flourishing, or more flourish ing, than usual. A scheme for bringing water from the Euphrates to Naiaf which has been on foot for the last three years seems at last within measurable distance of realisation. £t. 24,000 has been found, a quarter by the Municipality of Najaf, a quarter by Saiyid Jawwad, Kiliddar, a quarter by ’Abdul Muhsin, Shallash, and the rest by smaller people. The scheme involves a powerful pumping station to raise water 120 feet and drive it 6 miles through pipes. The Shallash and Saiyid Hadi, a son of the Kiliddar, who are now at Baghdad, visited me lately. They have been negotiating with the leading British firms here, but I am told that their expectations are somewhat extravagant. A small company has also been found formed for establishing an ice and flour factory at Kufah and possibly a motor boat service on the Hindiyah. The mechanic of the motor boat of this Residency is one of the shareholders and also the engineer of the concern. He is an Egyptian Arab who worked for some years in the United States. II. —British Interests and Cases. 1. I understand that the advance* of £50,000 given by the National Bank of Turkey to Sir J. Jackson, Limited, will * See last Summary, ii, i. n() j. gu ffi ce fi n i s h the Hindiyah Barrage, especially as work is being carried on concurrently at Habbaniyah. A fresh advance will be required before long, otherwise the operation must again come to a standstill. It would be interesting to know on what security the Bank have already advanced so large a sum on behalf of the Turkish Government, and whether it is a security of which the British Government could approve. It is to be hoped that no financial group is obtaining a mortgage on the lands of ’Iraq with powers of interference in the administration of the country. 2. I have had some conversation lately with Mr. Becharah who came to Baghdad several months ago as an engineer on the part of the Turkish Government to supervise the proceedings of Sir J. Jackson, Limited. He was employed in Egypt until appointed here, he knows English and gets on well with English people, and he seems a serious worker. He is reporting to the Turkish Govern ment on irrigation in the province generally and has recommended the creation of various irrigation circles with an engineer in charge of each, but he has little hope that his proposals will receive attention at the present moment. Mr. Becharah has advised a total modification of Sir W. Willcocks’ Habbaniyah scheme by which the work there would be transformed from an escape into a reservoir : this seems a daring step on the part of a young engineer with much less experience than Sir William. Mr. Becharah realises, I think, that no proper forethought has as yet been given to the orderly execution of the Mesopotamian irrigation programme, and that until the question of land tenures in this prov ince has been settled on a broad basis agricultural progress can only be partial at best.~ 7 ^ 3. Learning that Sir L Jackson, Limited, would be in want of a dredger for clearing the new main channel above the * See last Summary, I, 30 . Hindiyah Barrage after water has been ad mitted to it, I informed Mr. Whiley of the existence at Basrah of* a small dredger which a German firm were finding difficulty in selling to the Turkish authorities there, and he said that he would see about buying it. If he does so, it will be the end of a matter which has given some trouble at Basrah. 4. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s kerosine is making good headway at Baghdad, and the prejudice against it seems to have disappeared. Messrs. Strick and Company’s manager tells me that he had no difficulty in selling off 2,000 eases and that another 3,000 cases are on the way up from Muhammerah. The Anglo-Persian Company’s second quality (“ Palm Tree ”) is sold at 40 G. S. P. or about Ks. 5 per case, which is the price of the Standard Company’s “ Tiger ” brand; but it is a better oil, and I understand that Messrs. Strick are able to get cash for it, while the British firm of Messrs. Blockey Cree and Company, who are the agents for the American oil, have to accept bills. The highest quality of oil made at Abbadan (“ Lion and Sun ”) is about to be placedfcon the Baghdad market by Messrs. Strick, who hope that it will displace the best Russian brands. 5. The Eastern Bank, Limited, seem to be making good progress and have acquired an excellent reputation at Baghdad. They have been very fortunate in the selection of their local representatives, Messrs. Ware and Manwarmg. During the alarm which prevailed at one time dming the month among Christians and Jews, the panic extended to the street in which the Bank is situated and its doors were closed. I endeavoured, on the ground of this occurrence, to get a, Gendarmerie guard for the Bank, which was willing to pay for one ; but the Wall did not agree. He promised, however, that special instructions should be given to the Gendarmerie post nearest the Bank. The Eastern Bank, as already mentioned, undertook to receive applications for Turkish internal bonds ; and the Daftardar of the Wilayat, though a member of the Comnnittee of Union and Progress, seems to regard it with favour and holds out hopes of local Government business in future. Perhaps the Eastern Bank, on account of its connection with the National Bank, which it represents here, stands well with the Committee of Union and Progress ; or it may be that the Baghdad authorities only wish to play it off against the Imperial Ottoman Bank. 6 Messrs. Mashal Brothers, whose start here was attended by many difficul- ties seem to be getting on fairly well now. They run two motor omnibuses carrying 36 passengers each daily m both directions between Baghdad and Ba’qubah (30 miles on the way to the Persian frontier), and as a rule all the seats are taken. I think they look forward to extending their line in the same and other directions when they have discovered by experience what kind of car is most suitable for the country and when they are sure that the business will be profitable. They have now large premises including a good machine shop at the back of the town, and undertake repairs to oil engines, pumps, ordinary ncrrln crpq ptc Two European employes, Messrs. Sidebotham and Niall, live on th^ premises’etc.' Two engineers, Mr. T. J. Hogarth and Mr. G C.

Their duty is to prepare a workable scheme tor camnng out the objects of the Syndicate. They are now busy in making surveys and expect to remain for two or three months. According to the best local opinion a system of external tramways leading to suburbs and the electric local opun J perfectly feasible, and not unlikely to be profitable ; but Us consideLd very doubtful whether internal tramways could be made except at a 'prohibitive cost, there being not a single street at Baghdad at present wide enough to carry a tramw ay. 7 His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal writes under date of 28th March 1913: -‘The Archbishop of Canterbury s Mission had only thmteen Ws in their school at Bibavdi this winter, and it is probable that they will nTli d it worth their while to continue the Mission, which cannot be said to have G 124 ED /resulted in anything and which is * See Summary for October 1912, II, 1. that Mar Sha ’un, the head of the sect, seems to be trying to play the Russians and the British off against one another so as to obtain advantages from both. This confirms the opinion which I expressed after my visit to Musal in 1910 that the Nestorians are undesirable clients. Some of the members of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission lately visited Baghdad, but they said nothing to me about giving up work at Bibaidi. 8. On the 17th April, with reference to apprehensions of the Euphrates and Tigris S. N. Company (Messrs. Lynch) merging themselves with foreign elements under the Turkish flag in a monopolistic navigation combine on the rivers of Mesopotamia, I telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople that such a combine appeared objectionable from every point of view. General trade would suffer at the hands of the monopolists of river carriage ; and the combine, which would be very in- t Possibly the parties to the combine have fl U ential, wouldt do itsbest to prevent taken steps already in tins direction, . . . 1 « .. , the construction ol any railway between Baghdad and Basrah,—Messrs. Lynch because their interests are bound up with navigation and the German Baghdad Railway Company, another of the elements, because they would like Baghdad to be more accessible from the Aleppo than from the Basrah side. Again, from the purely British point of view, there would be a risk of the British element in the combine being in the end swallowed up by others, not to mention the possibility that an Ottoman Navigation Company might be forbidden by the Turkish Government to carry the British mail. &gt;t really wanted by the Nestorians ; they do not want education, they want* protection and money”. Mr. Hony goes on to say In my opinion the most advantageous step that could be taken in the interests of Mesopotamia and its trade would be that the Tigjfris should be thrown open to general navigation immediately, as the Karun was in 1888, and that the build ing of a Baghdad-Basrah railway should be accelerated as much as possible. I may add here that I think British enterprise is perfectly able to hold its own in Mesopotamia under a system of free competition, provided only that the competition is fair as well as free. 9. On the 25th April, under the impression that some discussion of the economic spheres of interest of foreign nations in Turkey might be impending, I wired again to Sir Gerard Lowther pointing out that the most important factor in the future of Mesopotamia, perhaps in that of Turkey, was the projected irrigation of the province. To include all the irrigation works, the British sphere should reach from Hit on the Euphrates and Samarrah on the Tigiris to the Persian Gulf, Samarrah being moreover a place visited by Indian pilgrims. With the addition of ’Anah to the above, the British sphere would become identical with the Wilayats of Baghdad and Basrah. It would be an excellent thing, from the point of view of British oil interests, to add the Musal Wilayat to the British sphere ; but this might be too much to try for, especially if the Samarrah-Baghdad section of the Baghdad Railway were to be transferred to us in any case. Britain has probably more to gain and to lose in this province than anywhere else in the Turkish Empire, and His Excellency could judge how far it would be profitable to consolidate our position here at the cost of sacrifices in other places. III.— British Indian Cases and Interests. 1. The case of HukmiJ, son of Ralo, Indian British subject, is still unsettled. i See last Summary, HI, 2. Tlle man has been illegally in Turkish custody since the middle of February (2j months) ; and the Turkish authorities, though they now admit his British nation ality, refuse to give him up and wish to proceed with his trial. The Wali was quite willing, I think, to surrender him ; but the recent delivery to us of Hasan, son of Agha’Ali, had been a bitter pill to the Wall’s Union and Progress entourage, and this made Muhammad Zaki Pasha afraid to repeat his action. The Procureur-General of Appeal took up an active part in opposing the surrender of Hukmi, and at last the Wali informed me that the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had forbidden it on the ground that ‘ ‘ foreignersaccused of crimes are necessarily detained in the Turkish prison This state ment, at variance with the truth and with practice, reduce me to the necessity of applying to His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador for assistance, which I did on the 30th April. IV.—British Official Matters. 1. The preliminary* enquiry * See last Summary, II, 2. into the accusations against Reginald Joynes was concluded on the 13th. April, when I formally charged him with :— (a) larceny of £T. 441 ; (b) embezzlement of £T. 381; and (c) falsification of accounts in respect of an item of £ 300; in his capacity as accountant to Messrs. Stride, Scott &amp; Co. Joynes then made a voluntary statement in court admitting the larceny, also embezzlement to the extent of £T. 180, but denying falsification of accounts. I charged him separately with bigamy, and this charge too he admitted. Besides observing the formalities prescribed for recording the statements of an accused person, I took the precaution of having Lieutenant A. C. Scott, R. I, M., commanding the “ Comet ”, present while Joynes’ confessions were being taken. Finally, I committed the prisoner for trial by His Britannic Majesty’s Supreme Court for the Dominions of the Sublime Ottoman Porte on all charges. A report from the Criminal Investigation Department, New Scotland Yard, shows Joynes to be a precocious and altogether phenomenal criminal. In 1906, he was convicted at Bow Street of the theft of £12 or £13 from the War Office Luncheon Club, of which he was Cashier, but apparently escaped punish ment under the First Offenders’ Act. He seems to have obtained his post with Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co., by inducing their agents in London to refer to his em ployers, then the Improved Chilling Company, from whom he forged a letter in reply giving himself a good character. At the same time, the Improved Chilling Company lost sight of him, and a few days after his disappearance they discovered that he had made away with £ 63 of their money, chiefly by altering the amounts of cheques. Joynes’ self-possession is one of the most remarkable things about him, and, though abnormal, he cannot be regarded as in the slightest degree insane. It is understood that Judge Cator will leave Constantinople in May to try the cases against Joynes at Baghdad. 2. On my return from India, I took steps for another distribution of money under the Oudh Bequest at Karbala and Najaf. The sums to be divided this time amounted, including some arrears, due to Turkish obstruction last year, to £T.7,033. The distribution went off very successfully at Karbala, and, at the end of the month, it was nearly finished at Najaf also. It took place under the super vision of the British Vice-Consul, Karbala, and was also watched by Major Scott, I.M.S., Assistant Resident, whom I asked to visit both places on tour during the operations. Before this distribution the ” Zuhur ”, the Committee of Union and Progress’s organ at Baghdad, had been commending the opposition offered by the Wali last f year to the British management of the Bequest, denouncing the apathy of his successor in the matter, and urging all and sundry not to place themselves under obligation to the British by accepting money from the Bequest. The success and largeness of the present distribution will probably elicit fresh fulminations from the ” Zuhur ”, but they are not likely to have any effect here while the Committee remains in its present weak and precarious situation. 3. I have already mentioned Major Scott’s journey on duty as Assistant Resident to Karbala and Najaf. It included also Babylon, the Hindiyah Barrage, Tawairij, Kufah and Hillah ; but I will leave him to describe it himself in a report which he is now writing.4. Samarrah, which is an Indian pilgrim resort and where there are a few settled British Indian subjects and a pilgrim guide, has not been visited by any one of our superior officers smce I was there in 1910. I accordingly proposed that I should visit it this year in the “ Comet ” during the spring floods which would enable her to make the passage. The “ Comet ” has been above Baghdad more than once be' ore, and last went to Samarrah in (I believe) 1897 ; but her right to navigate upstream is questioned by the Turkish Government, though it was as serted by His Britannic Majesty’s Government without demur on the part of the Porte in 1885, I had hoped that the present would be a good opportunity for getting the matter settled at Constantinople, but I learn from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that such is not the case. His Excellency suggested that I s' ould go without previous arrangements, but I had to explain in reply that there are two boat-biidges in the way which the Baghdad authorities would most probably not allow to be opened for the “ Comet ” without sanction from Constantinople. In these circumstances, the scheme for using the “ Comet ” must be adjourned, but I still hope to be able to visit Samarrah in the Residency motor boat during May. 5. My tour* up the Tigris in the “ Comet” in March has formed the subject of a not unfriendly but rather tactless * See P. S. to last Summary. article in the “ Misbah,” a Shi’ah Muham madan newspaper of Baghdad. After commenting o . my knowledge of Arabic and of the names of all the canals, tribes, Shaikhs, etc., in the country, the paper goes on to add that the higher Ottoman officials have not similar knowledge and that, if they had, they still would not trouble to talk to the Shaikhs. Effu sions of this sort are unfortunate, but there is no means of preventing them. 6. On the 28th April Jamadar Asa Singh, the Native Officer Commanding the Residency Guard (Q. V. 0. 2nd Rajput Light Infantry) complained to me of insubordinate conduct on the part of a non-commissioned officer and a sepoy and requested that both should be sent away from Baghdad. I held an enquiry, and, though the alleged insubordination did not seem to me very clearly proved, I thought it well that the two men complained of should be sent to the. headquarters of their Regiment, now at Bushehr. They were accordingly des patched as ordinary passengers without a guard to Bushehr, with orders to report themselves to their Commanding Officer there. The latter was informed by telegram through the Resident at Bushehr of the arrangements made, and I presume that the military authorities will take any further steps that may be l required for enforcing discipline. * V.— Persian Affairs. 1, I have consulted Mr. Soane, British Consul at Qasr-i-Shirin, regarding the highway robberyt of 27th September t See Summary for September 1912. IV, 2. 1912 by which Sub-Assistant Surgeon Saiyid Sarfa,raz Husain and Yusuf Khan were sufferers. It seems impossible to determine exactly who the robbers were, but it is almost certain that they were Turkish outlaws settled in Persian territory. In the circumstances, it seems doubt ful whether it will be possible to recover compensation from either the Turkish or the Persian Government, neither of which has any means of dealing with the freebooters. 2. At the end of a letter to me, dated 23rd April 1913, Mr. Soane, British Vice-Consul for Qasr-i-Shirin and Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s work at Chia Surkh, remarks “I do not think there is any likelihood of my coming to Baghd d for a long time : I am all alone here just now, and do not expect any Europeans for some time, as the other field is short of men. We have had a great deal of troub 1 e this year with the tribes, one man killed on our side, and two on theirs.” 2 A m ilitary guard has been re-established at the Turkish Consulate at Kir- manshah ; the last guardJ, it will be remem- j See Summary for December 1912, V, 2. bered, was withdrawn in December 1912.

Kurdish Chiefs seem to be divided in their attitude towards the Russians; some of them, among whom is the Shaikh of Baraizan, would apparently rather not have anv relations with Russia. J 2. It is impossible to find out here what is happening about the Baghdad Railway. I doubt whether Mr. Schroeder, who has been in charge since^f Meissner tySee last Summary, x, i. Pasha s departure, has any information on . . . ., _ the subject. Meanwhile, work is being car ried on 'very languidly, but the staff do not seem depressed. 3-. The on!y flag at Baghdad flown at half-mast on the day of the funeral of the Ring of Greece was that of the British Residency, no other Consulate having received instructions on the subject. The result was a rumour that Lord Hardinge had succumbed to the injuries which he received at Delhi on the 23rd December and l had enquiries on the subject from Consular colleagues and others. J. G.

There are continued rumours here that the Wilayet of Basrah has been *See Summary for February 1913. 1,-13. granted Self-government*. 2. It is understood that Lutfi Bey, the Assistant Wali, accompanied by Jemal Pasha, the gendarmerie Commandant of Baghdad, will make a tour of the Basrah, Baghdad and Musal Wilayets partly to st dy what scheme of reforms might be usefully introduced into these Wilayets and partly in connection with the re distribution of the gendarmerie of the three provinces. 3. All the so-called “ theatres ” and all exhibitions of public dancing have been stopped by an order from the Wali on account of the War. 4. The Zuhur newspaper has published an open letter addressed to the Wali criticising the ineffective steps he hag' taken to collect money for the War. The letter ends by saying, “ You belong if not to the first, then to the second class of the rich people of Turkey, you must therefore give ah your wealth to the State as the Ottoman Government has assured you of a livelihood until your death.” Needless to say the Wali has not taken the hint. 5. The Procureur General of the Appeal at Baghdad has sent a circular to all the Judicial authorities in the Baghdad Wilayet inviting them to participate in subscribing to the War relief fund. Some of the Judicial officials have subscribed half their month’s salary. 6. The Baghdad Municipal Council has forbidden the export of dates. 7. A section of the Arab inhabitants here are endeavouring to encourage the Arabs of this Wilayet to submit a united demand to Constantinople request ing decentralization for ’Iraq similar to what is said to have been granted to the Arabs of Syria. * In this connection prominence is given to a very important consultation, which is said to have taken place at the Shaikh of Mohammerah’s Palace between that personage and the Shaikh of Koweit and Saiyid Talib Effendi and another highly placed°Turkish official who, however, is not named. The meeting, it is said, had reference to the administration of ’Iraq. The conclusion arrived at was that ’Iraq should claim independence or at least self- government. Emissaries have been despatched from Basrah to Karbala and Najaf to prepare the people for future activity. The Arabs are said at present to be divided into various sections :— (a) Those who are partisans of the Basrah movement. (b) Those corresponding with Syria. (c) Those corresponding with Egyptian Nationalists. (d) A separate Baghdad party. (e) Those who are in favour of the Turks. Saleh-ud-din Kerkukli, the editor of the Zuhur, on March 14th devoted a leading article to this question of decentralization. The following is an extract : “ gome Muhammadans desire decentralization. They ought to know that this is not permissible according to Muhammadan Law because the centre of the whole X 8 l a mic world is the town of the Khalifa (Constantinople), Christians are said to b e making great progress by means of decentralizaion, but Moslems must recollect : that Christians have three Gods and can, therefore, have more than one centre. Moslems having only one God can have but one centre.” C64FD . .Early on the morning of March 18th printed copies of a seditious appeal were found stuck on the walls of the courtyards of most of the mosques here and also in many of the hammams (Turkish baths). The document invited the Arabs to rise up against the Turks and demand autonomy or decentralization. The police at once tore down the offending notices and destroyed them. No doubt considerable anti-Turkish feeling exists in Baghdad at present. 8. The Government officials at the Serai displayed some nervousness on March 25th as it was seriously rumoured that the Baghdad partisans of Saiyid Talib Effendi of Basrah would endeavour to seize the Serai. Soldiers protected the Government offices and extra police patrolled the streets. However, no demonstration of any kind took place. 9. The school of the local branch of the Committee of Union and Progress at Baghdad has been reopened. 10. The pupils of the British Indian school* at Karbala expressed a desire, *See Summary for March and April 1913. to their School Committee, to go without v, ~~ 7 * . prizes this year and asked the Committee to transmit the money value of the prizes to the Mutasarrif of Karbala through the British Vice-Consul for the benefit of the Muhammadans wounded in the War. Altogether 100 Mejidiehs (=about T. £19) were sent, of which the Vice- Consul himself subscribed 20. A misleading account of this affair appeared in the Baghdad paper Al Misbak in which it was stated that the money had been subscribed to the Turkish War loan and not for the relief of Muhammadan sufferers. I instructed the President of the Committee to publish a contradiction. 11. A private letter received here from Nasirieh says that in an encounter between Ajeymi, son of the late Sadun Pasha, and the Budur tribe, the former was defeated with great loss. 12. The Baghdad paper Al Misbah announces that according to the horos copes of astronomers England will be utterly ruined during the year 1913. 13. Bobberiesf are still rife in Baghdad town. Thirty pieces of valuable cloth tSee Summary for January 1913 . I,— 15 . belonging to a Jewish merchant were TT eve n stolen from the Baghdad Custom House. 14. A Committee has been formed here under the Presidency of the Wali and the Vice-Presidency of Muhammad Pasha Daghistani to sell the shares of the Internal Loan. So far only £ T. 1,112 has been collected and about £ T. 1,000 in Baghdad town. in the districts of Baghdad Wilayet 15. One Saiyid Muhammad Hibetuddin Shahristani who has visited Muscat has founded there a Muhammadan Society in Oman described as “ Al Ittifaq ” (Union). Its object is said to be the improvement of Islam. 16. The Ottoman Government has increased the monthly salarv of Amp^r Abdul Aziz Assu’ud to £ T. 150. J 17. As a counter-stroke to the present Arab unrest the local authorities have nominated certain Arab teachers and Mullas to advise the Arabs to be faithful to the Turkish Government. 18. Lutfi Bey, Assistant Wali, made a brief visit of inspection at Azizivph on March 14th. ' , r . 19 - Ghulam Riza Khan, Wali of Luristan, has come to Baghdad Kut three of his sons and 220 followers accompanied him. The President of the Municipality and Qudret Bey, Director of Foreign Affairs, welcomed him on his arrival in the name of the Turkish Government. Ghulam Riza Khan is residing at Kazimain.^ B®ghdad has received a telegraphic order that from the com- “attot Uth - I913) ^ ~ 21 It is rumoured here that the Arab Moslems of Syria ’Iraq and Egypt to'residl 0 in al Ar„b ' ) GoVer '} mer ‘ t at Constantinople that the Khalifa ouglA to reside m an Arab country and not in Constantinople. of th^Moslems™ 0111 ^ tllat ^ Klledive of wil1 be electe d “ King and Khalifa f' 2 ', J W0 Chald eans were arrested for spreading a false rumour that there ^\as to be a massacre of the non-Muhammadan population. 23 At the Serai it is stated that the Wali/of Baghdad and Basrah have been ordered from Constantinople not to collect War relief money from the inhabitants ot -Baghdad and Basrah. No shares of the Internal Loan are to be sold to the people of Basrah. £ he W all / f Baghdad is said to be awaiting an order from Constantinople which will instruct him to proceed to Basrah on a secret official mission. 24. The Baghdad paper Al Misbah states that it learns that Mr. Consul fehakespeare (of Koweit) will make a journey into the furthest parts of Najd. W hat object the British Government has in view, in sending him there the newspaper is at a loss to explain. ’ 2d. A man at Najaf refused the other day to pay certain taxes and wounded a Government official who was collecting them. The people who were in the Bazar ot Najal at the time protected the assailant and refused to allow him to be arrested. 26. Arab robbers are said to have attacked out in the desert an Afghan watch man who was guarding a tent belonging to the Baghdad Railway Company in which was kept £ T. 500 for paying the wages of the Railway contractors. 27. Mr. Crow now reports that the Mazbata * which was telegraphed to Constantinople on February 22nd has been signed by some 300 Arab Notables. *See Summary for February 1913. 1,14. 28. The Minister of the Interior has granted the Tapoo Department permis sion to register properties belonging to the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit. .. 2! !- Mr : Pf™’ Brltl ?h Consul at Basrah, gives the following as present distribu- tion of Turkish troops in the El Hassa district: (а) 140 men, 1st Battalion, 112th Regiment. In the El Katr peninsula. (б) 85 Kadro units of the 3rd Battalion, 112th Regiment, at Katif. (c) 80 Kadro units of the 3rd Battalion, 112th Regiment, at Ojeir. (d) 190 men, 2nd Battalion of the 112th Regiment, at Hofuf. 30. The acting W r ah of Basrah is, Mr. Crow reports, about to buy a small dredger from the German firm of W r onckhaus and Co. The Basrah Notables have long been desirous of having all the creeks dredsed* especially the Khendek and Ashar creeks. n , f, 1 - Shaikh Faleh el Bunaiyeh of the Beni Lami and brother of Shaikh Chadban of the Beni Lam tribe visited Mr. Crow on March 12th in disguise of a Dervish. &amp; The object of the visit was to obtain British protection for the Beni Lam from Kut to Kurna on both sides of the Tigris in a dispute about the Muqata’as (Crown lands) with the Ottoman Government. It would appear that the Beni Lam otve the Turkish Government some £ T 162,000 on account of these Crown lands. Shaikh Faleh stated that if the Turkish Government would lease them the own lands for 15 years the Beni Lam were prepared to pay down £ T 100 000 in cash. * 5If no amicable settlement can be arrived at, their programme is to seize and plunder Amara, stop the Tigris Navigation and attack Basrah. The Beni Lam, Shaikh Faleh stated, were not prepared to act in concert with Saiyid TiJib Effendi as their aims and objects were different and they preferred to act independently. The Muntafik tribes whom Shaikh Faleh had visited were, he said, equally Lnti-Turkish. Ajeymi, son of the late Sadun Pasha, who was in camp at Jebel-ul-Mughair had 9,000 aimed horsemen with him. He said Aieymi considered Saiyid Talib paitly responsible for the betrayal and death of his father and for that reason would never unite with Saiyid Tal b. Mr Crow considers that “ the mere fact of Shaikh Faleh’s risking his personal safety alone in Basrah in order to see me and talk the matter over frankly points to the sincerity of the Arab feelings towards ourselves (British) and the implicit fr ith they place in oui friendship. It would not do to alienate them at the present juncture and 1 feel that a cold reception or a rebuff might cost us dearly later, if their plans materialise, as it is quite possible they may in view of the weakness of the Turkish authorities.” IL—British Interests and Cases. 1 The loan* of £50,000 for the purposes of the Mesopotamian irrigation works at Hindie, between the Turkish Govern- *See Summary for February 1913. n,—2, men t and the Naticnal Bank of Turkey, has now been arranged.

Mr. Soane telegraphed me that he learnt that the Turks intended despatch ing a punitive force into Persian territory near the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s oilfields. At His Excellency the Ambassador’s advice 1 brought the matter to the notice of the Wali. The Wali premised me to always respect the rights of the Anglo-Per sian Oil Company’s property, but added that at present it was not intended to send any punitive expedition into Persia. 5. Tribal raids and counter-raids have taken place between the Persian Sinjabis and the Turkish Zengana. The Sinjabi are said to have looted the property of Reshid Pasha near Khanakin carrying off all the cattle and cutting down the stadnding crops. Afterwards, according to reports from muleteers, the Sinjabi practically besieged Khanakin and carried off about 4,000 cattle. Four gendarmes were wounded and one soldier killed and many Arabs were also killed and wounded. III. —British Indian Interests and Cases. 1.

VII. —Miscellaneous and General. Nil. NORMAN SCOTT, Major, I.M.S., British Residency and His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul. Consulate-General ; Baghdad, 5th April 1913. J P.5.—After completing my special duty at Simla I was at Delhi from the 22nd to the 24th February, and various questions relating to the Baghdad Resi dency were discussed there with the Foreign Office. On the 25th I halted at Cawnpore and visited the Cawnpore Woollen Mills, one of the largest industrial concerns in India. They have had a depot with one of their own employes in charge at Baghdad for the last 2 years. I had some con versation with Sir A. McRobert, the Manager of the Mills, who wishes to visit Baghdad. The 26th, 27th and 28th February were spent at Lucknow, where with the pre vious assent of the Foreign Office I showed some leading Shi’ahs a photographic copy of the King of Oudh’s part of the Agreement of 1825 by which the Oudh6 Bequest was founded. There were present at the meeting, which was held on the 27th at the Deputy Commissioner’s house, the following :— 1. Maulvi Nasir Husain, the chief Mujtahid of Lucknow; 2. Saiyid Baqir, Mujtahid; 3. Saiyid ’Abdul Hasan, Mujtahid; 4. Saiyid Agha Hasan, Mujtahid; 5. Mufti Saiyid Ahmad ’Ali; 6. Maulvi Saiyid Muhammad Bazi-ud-Din of Jaunpur; 7. 'Maulvi Saiyid Muhammad Husain, son of No. 6; 8. Khan Bahadur Mirza Nazir Husain, Hakim; 9. Nawab Sadiq Husain; 10. Nawab Ja’far Husain; and 11. Mr. Hamid ’Ali Khan, barrister-at-law. The only new point raised was one insisted on by Maulvi Nasir Husain, who argued that according to the wording of the deed the money must be distributed in cash to those benefited, and that it would not be allowable to spend it^ on hospitals, pilgrim arrangements, etc., for their indirect advantage. The Maulvi’s construction of the deed was approved by Saiyid Karamat Husain, a retired High Court Judge whom I consulted privately the next day; and I foresee that it may become neces sary for me to refer the point to the Government of India. I received a visit while at Lucknow from Nawab Mehdi Husain Khan, C.I.E., better known at the “Abu Sahib” who is the principal trustee of the Husainabad endowment there. Husainabad is the tomb of King Muhammad ’Ali Shah of Oudh, as the Imam- barah Najaf Ashraf is that of King Ghazi-ud-Din-Haidar, the founder of the Oudh Bequest. The Husainabad is of importance at Baghdad because from the endow ments connected with it about Bs. 10,000 a year is spent in enabling poor Indian pilgrims to visit Karbala and Najaf. I asked whether a part of the money allowed to each pilgrim could be sent to the British Besidency at Baghdad, to meet the cost of his return journey to India, and I understood that the suggestion was welcomed and would be considered. Probably these Husainabad payments have been the means in the past of bringing to this country many poor Indians who have not been able to leave it ag. in. I was sorry to find there was little prospect of good Mujtahids being found at Lucknow willing to accept appointments at Karbala and Najaf. At Bombay on the 5th April, I called at the Civil Secretariat with reference to Indian pilgrimages in Mesopotamia and to the relation between railways and steam navigation on the Indus. I thought that the latter might afford some guidance as to tho probable effects of a Baghdad-Basrah Bailway on steam navi gation of the Tigris, but there proved to be little analogy between the two cases. I arrived at Muhammerah on 13th March, where I transhipped to the B. I. M. S. Comet, and on the 15th I visited the ’Abbadan refinery of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Since the beginning of last year a large quantity of plant has been set up, and production is now coming into swing. The atmosphere of the place is one of great activity, and work seems to be carried on at high pressure. ’Abbadan refined oil is now on the local market and even that of the second quality I have found excellent in use; but native opinion seems against it at present, probably because it is a novelty. I spent a day at Basrah, 16th to 17th March, and received much interesting information about the state of the country from Mr. Crow, His Britan Jc Majesty’s Consul. I visited the Acting Wali of Basrah, Ali Biza Pasha, formerly comnanding the Baghdad Army Corps, an Arab of Damascus. He has always been a good friend of mine, but this time he insisted on embracing me. On the way to Baghdad by river I landed at a number of places and did my best to visit the Turkish official at each. At Qal’at Salih I found an Arab Qaim Maquam, a native of Palestine, Khalil Bey, with a small.detachment of regular infantry, probably a company.At ’Amarah the Mutasarrif was a Turk, but I did not see him as he had not reached his office when I called there. I was told that the garrison consisted of one battalion of the 112th and one of the 113th Regiment, and of a Frontier Company which would shortly be sent to Dawairij as an outpost. One of the two Thorny croft motor gun L cats belonging to the Turkish naval establishment of this province was lying at ’Amarah. Her two guns, carried fore and aft, are very small; their calibre seems only about two inches, but from their being water-jacketed it would seem that they are for rapid fire. At Kun ait I found a civil Mudir and a battalion of regular infantry. At Ali-ash-Sharqi, where the Comet halted for a night, there were no Turkish officials or even police. At Filaifilah there w r as a Mudir, a native of the province, who expected that his headquarters would shortly be shifted to ’Ali-ash-Sharqi; the only men at his dis posal were one or two gendarmes. A few miles above Filaifilah I visited Juwai one of the chief Shaikhs of the Bani Lam in a tent beside his fort on the bank of the river. It will be remembered that for the past year or two Juwai and Shabib having been holding lands on lease from the Turkish Government which their relative Ghadhban, who is generally con sidered to be the real head of the tribe, claims should be rented to him. Now, it seems, Shaikh Shabib has joined Ghadaban in his opposition to the Government, and Juwai, who remains loyal, is being bolstered up with military assistance. At the time of my visit a squadron of the 31st Cavalry Regiment from Baghdad was encamped under the wall of Juwai’s fort and had been there for some time. There were also some gendarmes. The Captain of the Squadron, Hasan Bey, and the Gendarmerie officer were present during the whole of my visit, which prevented my receiving much interesting infoimation from the Arabs. I was told, however, and the fact was confirmed elsewhere on the river, that rifle cartridges among the tribes now cost a Qran (about four pence) each, instead of being sold at 4 or 5 to the Qran : this is admittedly a consequence of the British naval blockade in the Persian Gulf. Juwai afterwards came on board the Comet. In case of further development of the Bani Lam trouble the following diagram showing the relationship of the Bani Lam Shaikhs may be useful :— Jundi. ) Madhkur. 1 Midhban. I Banaiyah. Lazim. Shabib. (adother ) ) l Ghadhban. Juwai. The Qaim-Maqam at ’Ali-al-Gharbi was Muhammad Fahmi, a native of Musal and a former acquaintance. At Shaikh Sa’ad, a large Arab village where the ship stopped, the Shaikh, named Falaiyah, came off to see me w T ith two others. On the w^ord “ Osmanli ” being mentioned in some connection he exclaimed quite irrelevantlv, “ The Os manli is done for !” but 1 ignored the opening which he perhaps intended to give. At the important town of Kut I was surprised to find an Arab Qaim-Maqam of Baghdad birth, ’Arif Bey Suwaidizadah, whose brother Naji Bey has been Qaim- Maqam of Najaf for a considerable time. Similarly at Bghailah and Suw r airah the Mudirs were natives of this province, being ’Abdul Latif Bey and ’Aziz Effendi, both I think Baghdadis. The general impressions wffiich I formed on return from India up to the time of reaching Baghdad were that the safety of the Tigris in the Bani Lam country is5 8 threatened, though it has not yet been disturbed, but that this is a purely local mat ter ; that the people of the province generally make less account of the Turks and are more inclined to be civil to foreigners than before; that cmZi-Ottoman feeling, though now sometimes allowed to appear, is not widespread or acute ; and that the large ness of the proportion of civil officials here who are Arabs may before long become a matter of importance. I arrived at Baghdad on the 26th March and found everything in good order. Major Scott deserves great credit for the way in which he has carried on the work of the Residency during nearly seven months and for the excellent state in which he has handed it over. J. G.

APR I b io . Summary of events in Turkish iraq for the month of February (received 25th March) 1913. I.—Internal Affairs. 1. On February 3rd a public service was held at the Serai. The spiritual heads of the Christian and Jewish communities were present at the Wali’s in vitation. The object of the meetirig* was *S« Summary for November 1912, 1-9. ^ ofie] . up prayers for the of the Turkish arms. Troops were brought in from the barracks outside the town to be present at the Serai. The military bands, it was noticed, played mournful music, while the soldiers were marching in. 2 Some slight excitement w r as caused here among the Foreign Consuls, when it became known on February 7th that the local Mudir of Posts and Telegraphs refused to accept any cypher or code telegrams, addressed by the Consuls to their Embassies. No explanation was offered by the Mudir, who simply wrote across a telegram, I wished to have sent, that secret telegrams were no longer accepted by the telegraph department “ par ordre superieure ”. He did not even sign his remark. On sending the 1st Residency Dragoman to interview him, the Mudir repeated the same formula, and would give no explanation. I at once wrote a letter to the Wali, asking him, if the fact, as reported by his subordinate, was true. He replied that the telegraph department had received orders to that effect, but that in his opinion it w'as a very serious step for the Central Government to have taken to prevent the representative of a friendly and neutral power from com municating privately with his Ambassador, and that he would report the matter at once to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. On February 9th, as no further progress in the matter had been made, the doyen of the Consular Corps at Baghdad (Monsieur Orlow, Russian Consul-General) convened a meeting of all the Consuls at his house. Every Consul attended. It was unanimously agreed to present a collective protest to the Wali, stating that this most important order should, in their opinion, have been officially communi cated to each Consul by the Vilayet, and not by means of the Mudir of the tele graph department at the time of their wishing to despatch a cypher telegram. The protest signed by all the Consuls was presented to the Wali next day by the doyen Monsieur Orlow. I informed His Excellency the Ambassador by a telegram en clair how matters stood. I also took the precaution of sending a cypher telegram report on the incident by post to Bushire to be sent in case of need. Fortunately, this was not necessary, as the prohibition was withdrawn on February 14th. 3. Mr. Hony, British Vice-Consul at Musal, reports that the coup de main of the Committee was received with disgust by the population there, except by the mlitary officers. 4. The newly appointed Wali of Musal is, I hear, Muharram Bey, at one time Mutasarrif of Bigha. 5. A written order from the Shaikh-ul-Islam was read at the Serai on February 5th, and was afterwards published in the newspapers. It commands all Muhammadans to collect funds, and send them to Constantinople. 6. A sealed box was circulated in the bazars and streets of Baghdad for the purpose of collecting funds for the War. 7. The Wali has several times tendered his resignation, but each time the Central Government refuse to accept it. ,• ; C. 806 FD8. The “ Zuhur ”, the Committee’s local paper, frequently publishes excit ing articles inviting people either to join the troops in the field of war, or else to subscribe money. The same newspaper devoted a leading article, insulting and calumniating Kiamil Pasha. Its final phrase was that Kiamil Pasha’s only desire was to please the Power to which he was attached (presumably England). 9. The Jewish community held a largely attended service of public prayer in their largest Synagogue on February 13th. The Wall, and other high Turkish officials were present. After the prayer came the usual demand for subscriptions for the War. 10. Towards the close of January (old style), grave doubts were felt by all Turkish officials and pensioners, whether the salaries for the month would be paid. After a week’s anxiety, a telegram was received from Constantinople, ordering the salaries to be paid. 11. On the anniversary of the birth of the Prophet of Islam, a rumour, which proved to be without foundation, was spread that all non-Muhammadans were to be murdered. Complete tranquillity, however, reigned. Indeed, the people seem to me hopelessly apathetic in regard to the success or non-success of the Turkish troops. The French Consul, I understand, brought the rumour to the notice of the Wali. 12. The price of cereals in Musal has risen to unheard of prices, and some of the Notables of Musal, Mr. Hony reports, seized the occasion to make a corner in them. 13. Mr. Crow, British Consul at Basrah, reports that Talaat Bey telegraphed to the local branch of the Committee of Union and Progress at Basrah, and Haider Sherif Bey, also to the President of the Municipality there, asking them to form a Committee of National Defence for the purpose of collecting money, and raising a regiment of volunteers. Saiyid Talib Bey, the deputy for B.israh, convened a formal meeting at his house, and formed a Committee with himself as President. The President of the Municipality informed Haider Sherif Bey of the steps taken by telegram. In view of the feeling of the Arabs to the present regime, no serious steps will, Mr. Crow thinks, be taken in the matter. 14. A more interesting meeting was, Mr. Crow reports, convened by the same Saiyid Talib Bey, at his house, on February 20th. All the principal Arabs attended. A Mazbata was prepared, and is being at present circulated for sig nature. The signatories request permission to summon a meeting of a General Provincial Council, with a view r to elaborate a scheme of reforms of which the Province stands in urgent need. It is suggested to adopt a plan of reforms similar to that sanctioned for the Vilayet of Syria. The request is couched in courteous and temperate terms, but is really a request for an Autonomous Government. It is proposed that the taxes of the Province be devoted to local needs, and that only the balance, if any exists after the local requirements have been satisfied, be sent to Constantinople. A copy of the document is to be handed to the Wali, and its contents are also to be telegraphed to the Grand Vizier, and the Minister of the Interior. {See Annexure A.) 15. Mr. Hony, British Vice-Consul at Musal, has forwarded me a note of his in regard to the political position of Musal, more especially with regard to the policy of Great Britain. The following is an extract:— “ Musal cannot at present be said to belong to any sphere of influence, and it is still an open question, whether it will be joined to the British sphere in Mesopotamia, to the French sphere in Syria, to the sphere which Germany is trying to create for herself, or to the Russian sphere, which is steadily enlarging itself to the North-East of Musal.”(9 li i Geographically Musal would certainly belong to the same sphere as Baghdad and Basrah, and the French seemed to have recognised this. They were for long the most influential nation here, on account of their old-established mission, and the large numbers of Roman Catholics, who looked to them for protection, but signs are not wanting that their influence has declined, and that they are con centrating their forces on Syria. The French Consulate-General at Baghdad has, I believe, been reduced to a Vice-Consulate. The Russians take little interest in Musal at present. Their Vice-Consul habitually resides at Baghdad, only spending a fortnight in Musal each year, but they are working hard to secure the allegiance of the Kurds, in the country between Van and Rowanduz, and each day brings their sphere nearer to Musal. The GermanJ^have not shown much activity here up till now. They have had a Vice-Consul for some years, but^has nothing to do. The Baghdad Railway engineers apply direct to the Vilayet, if they need assistance, and there are no other German subjects. German trade is insignificant. But it cannot be doubted that they will not long leave Musal unattacked. Their outposts are at Urfa and Ras el Ain, where Baron Max Oppenheim has been working assiduously at other things than archaeology. It would not be surprising to hear any day that a large German school or hospital was to be opened here. British interests are at present in a favourable position. British trade is pre dominant, and the great Baghdad houses of Lynch and Bloskey Cree are doing an ever increasing business. There is a small school and a hospital run by the C. M. S. But we are fortified against no attack. Beyond the little C. M. S. school, which is only for small children, there is no place where Enolish can he learnt. Again, the coming of the Baghdad Railway may mean that much trade, which has hitherto come by the Persian Gulf and Baghdad, may be diverted to the Mediterranean-Aleppo route. It remains to be considered what steps might be taken to fortify our position. As regards the teaching of English, this Vice-Consulate recently started classes for that purpose. The greatest enthusiasm was shown, and many applicants had to be turned away, because there w 7 as no room for them. The Roman Catholic schools punished any of their boys, who attended these classes, in terror lest they should be prevented from the true faith, but many boys came nevertheless, and, in self-defence, the Roman Catholics began to take steps towards the teaching of English in their own schools. The head of the Dominicans asked the French Vice-Consul, if he saw any objection to it, and the latter replied that he did not. Unfortunately, one of my teachers got a post elsewhere, and another is likely to leave Musal soon. I cannot afford to pay a sufficient salary to enable a teacher to devote his wdiole time to the classes, nor is it right or expedient that such an undertaking should depend entirely on the private resources of the Vice- Conjsul. I would suggest that (1) the C. M. S. should be urged to enlarge their school, and, if possible, aided financially to do so. (2) That the Jewush school should be encouraged to teach English. I have already approached the Director of the Alliance Israelite on the subject, and he has written about it to the head quarter of the Alliance in Paris. The chief difficulty is the expense. I under stand, however, that the “ Jews Colonization Society ” of London is willing to subvention schools, on condition that English is taught in them. The difficulty might thus be solved, if Sir Edward Grey could see his way to approach that institution on the subject. (3) The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission to the Nestorians has had ideas of sending a similar Mission to the Jacobites. * If Mar Shimun eventually throws in his lot with the Russians, as seems most probable, the Archbishop’s Mission will very likely be compelled to withdraw, and should this be the case, it is certainly to be hoped that thev will turn their attention to the Jacobites. They would, I think, find it a more grateful task. Moreover, the Jacobites are a well-to-do community, and would bear the greater part of the expense themselves. They only want Englishmen, as organisers and teachers. If any of the above projects were carried out, the Roman Catholics wmuld be obliged to introduce English into their schools, for so great is the desire to learn English, that the parents would not hesitate to send their children to Protestant, ✓LL / 11 i * 1ssmmsmmmm i *= 4 Jacobite, or even Jewish schools, if English were taught there, and not in their schools. The Government of India might be inclined to help in this matter, for India could not but benefit by an increase in the number of persons knowing English. I believe that a word or two from the Foreign Office in the right quarters might bring about a great success on the lines above mentioned. If we do not take some steps to enable the people of Musal to learn English, the Germans will certainly take steps to enable them to learn German, to the benefit of German, and the detriment of English, trade, and influence. As regards the change of trade route, I should not be apprehensive of it being detrimental to English interests, but for the fact that British houses are so strongly established in Baghdad, whereas German houses are probably better established at Aleppo. The only suggestion I have to make in this respect is that we should be ready to assist Lynch, or any other British Company, in securing a concession for the navigation of the Tigris up to Musal, and the lower freights ought to assure the pre-eminence of that route over any other. There is one point further to which I would beg to call your attention, I quote from Dr. Rohrbacher’s 'Die Baghdadbahn, pages 42 to 44 :— “ I have personally visited the naphtha springs of Kerkuk, and the neigh bouring springs of Baba Gurgur. Both one and the other are more considerable than similar phenomena in the peninsula of Aspcheron in Russian Transcaucasia, before boring was begun. When we have seen what an important role naphtha products have played in Russia, as fuel for railways, steamships, and many industrial undertakings, and consider the tremendous importance of petroleum in these days as a material for burning and lighting, we ought to attach the greatest importance to the circumstance that the Baghdad Railway will pass close to petroleum districts. The only thing to be feared is that foreign gold and foreign speculators should succeed in securing a preferential right over the exploitation of Mesopotamian naphtha, before any effective German initiative has been taken.” Everything possible should be done by the Foreign Office, and the Board of Trade to ensure that English capital does what Dr. Rohrbach fears. 16. I append (Annexure B) a translation of a circular issued by the author ities at Musal in connection with the raising of money for the new internal loan. Mr. Hony, British Vice-Consul, and his French colleague, represented the matter to the Wali of Musal, and the circular was withdrawn. Its language is so exaggerated, that it was feared it would have a dangerous effect on the ignorant fanatical population. There is a strong feeling of resent ment against the Turks in Musal. The Chief of the Ulema summed up the situa tion in these words. “ We are ordered to pay tithes to the Commander of the Faithful, if he pro tects our honour and our property ; our honour he has lost on the battlefields of Roumeli, our property is daily plundered by Arabs on this side and Kurds on that and, therefore, any money we pay to the Sultan is haram or unlawful.” | The people of Baghdad entertain, I think, very similar ideas, and a Musal merchant of Baghdad, who was sent for by the Commission, who are trying to collect money for the Internal loan at Baghdad, which includes the Wali and Assistant Wali, and other notables, explained the situation to them in practically identical terms. 17. A seditious pamphlet, printed in Hebrew, has been caused to be distrib uted among the Jews of Baghdad by a certain Mr. Wm. Blackstone, an American Missionary. He took the precaution of leaving Baghdad before the distribution took place. The pamphlet first deals with the treatment allotted to the Jews by the nations of the world. As they have received no pity they need not shew anyIt then passes on to say that the Turkish Government is rotten, and the Central authority impotent. A general dissolution of the Ottoman Empire is impending. Now is the time for the Jews to strike for Palestine. Christ for tire Jews is yet to come, but it says he is already in the world, incarnated in flesh and blood, and will shortly declare himself. This is the time for the Jews to range themselves under His banner, and by their money and influence possess themselves of Palestine. If they neglect this opportunity another is not likely to come The Jews of Baghdad are, I hear, secrectly glad at this announcement, but I suspect that they have not given the movement any practical encouragement. 18. The following is an extract from a letter received by a Baghdad merchant from a friend in Armenia.— ' There is no public security in the Kurdistan region. An Armenian Deputy, and six of his followers have been killed. It is rumoured that the Russians are stirring up the Kurdish tribes in the region of Erzeroom and Van to obtain their independence. The Russians are assisting them with money. The famous Beder Khan tribe of Kurds are in favour of the Russians.- The Russians are also exciting the Nestorians against the Turks. II. —British Interests and Cases. I. The almost sole topic of conversation and discussion in Baghdad, for the last fortnight of this month, both among the European colonies and the local in habitants, private and official, has been the astounding series of crimes^committed, I regret to report, by a British subject, Mr. Reginald (Rex) William lord Gerard Paul Joynes (alias de Juignes), whom it was my painful duty to arrest on the even ing of February 20th. The war, politics, and, indeed, everything else has been temporarily blotted out of the people’s mind. On the evening of Sunday, February 9th, about 7-45 r.M., while I was sitting in my office working, an urgent message was sent to me to go, as quickly as possible, to the offices of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, Limited, as it was reported Mr. Joynes, their Assistant Manager, had fallen from the roof, and had broken his back. This urgent summons had been sent to me by Mr. William Wilson, the firm’s new Manager, who had been briefly informed of the facts verbally by one of the Arab door-keepers of their offices. Mr Joynes, who arrived in Baghdad from London to take up tbe post of Assistant Manager (Accountant) last June, in the newly opened branch of Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited, had, from the date of his arrival, let it be generally known that he had private means (some £300 per annum), and that he m no sense depended entirely on his income from Strick Scott’s for a living. He is a tall, thin, pallid, sickly-looking man with blue eyes, and fair hair. I still remember one of his first appearances at the British Club neatly dressed, and with a green velvet soft hat. His sponsor introduced him, and mentioned the fact privately that he would be an acquisition to the small community, as he had been educated at Harrow and “ Jesus” College, Cambridge. His delicate health—“ weak heart for which he said he^had made a voyage round the world with his father, visiting China, Japan, San Francisco, and other places, excused him from playing games, and to all except a few intimate friends he remained a comparative stranger. His chief, Mr. R. 0. Harvey, however, always extolled him and he told every one how plucky Mr. Joynes was often working at the office,- when he should have been in bed.In October, be became engaged to be married to Miss C. S. E. Sommer, a lady doctor, with high English medical qualifications (M. B., B. S., London), and, who was the lady assistant of Dr. Lenders, a German medical practitioner here. She to please him became a British subject, having been born, and her birth regis tered in London, and renounced her German nationality. The marriage was fixed to take place on February 11th and the notice of marriage was duly hung up at this Consulate-General, When, therefore, I received the sudden summons on February 9th my first thought was that a sad tragedy had occurred. I drove to the offices of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, with all haste, and ran up the stairs. I was shewn into a room, where I saw Mr. Wilson, the Manager, and Mr, Levack standing with anxious faces, and Mr. Joynes lying white, and prostrate, on a sofa with Miss Som mer in attendance. I asked “ Is jt true he has fallen off the roof,” but no one could tell me. All that was known was that Mr, Joynes was found lying unconscious in a corner of the inner courtyard of the office near the well. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Levack left the room, leaving me alone with Miss Sommer and Mr. Joynes. I quickly examined him, and found at once that at any rate his back was not broken. His pulse was good, and although he appeared stunned, I said I was happy to say I saw no cause for immediate anxiety. I noticed at the same time he had some scratches on the left side of his neck, which were bleeding slightly. Miss Sommer said that Mr. Joynes had, with the knowledge and approv al of his chief, been working in the office, since 3 o’clock (Monday being mail day here), and that since 4 o'clock she had been sitting reading in his room, while he worked. He without saying anything to her had left the office room about 7 p.m, (in fact she did not clearly recollect him going out of the room), and she went on reading. Suddenly it occurred to Jher that “ Rex ” had been a long time absent, but she thought nothing of it. Then she heard what she took to be the report of a revolver shot, and she became nervous, and went out into the verandah, overlook ing the court-yard of the inner house. From there she thought she saw a human form (it was then almost dark) lying prone in a corner of the yard. She called one of the watchmen, who came running from the outer house up the small stairs of the outer house, and along the verandah of the two houses to where Miss Sommer was standing. The thick door on the ground floor between the two courtyards being closed and barred, The watchman even in that light identified the form as Mr. Joynes, and calling his mate to bring a lantern they ran along the verandah, and down the stairs near Mr. \\ ilson’s room to the courtyard, and just as they came up to Mr. Joynes the second watchman overtook them with a lantern. The watchmen examined him roughly, and tried to unclench his hands (an Arabic custom), but being unable to do so, and seeing him deadly white, and un conscious, and with blood on his neck thought him dying, and that he must have fallen off the roof. Miss Sommer sent one watchman for Dr. Lenders (Mr, Joynes’ friend, and me dical attendant), and the other for Mr. Wilson. Miss Sommer was excited, and nervous, but not unduly so, as Mr. Joynes, as everyone in Baghdad knew was liable to fainting attacks, and she though the had perhaps fallen and hurt himself, as there were some loose pew iron pipes lying in a pile near where he was found. I did not on that evening have all this information in such a concise form, and my endeavours were directed to try and rouse Mr. Joynes for I felt very sorry that an accident should have occurred to him on the eve of his marriage. I suc ceeded in musing him a little, and gave him a few spoonfuls of brandy. He then called out in a dazed way “ Look out he’s got a revolver/’ and I think he added later the “ Safe ” the “ Safe Just then (less than 5 minutes after my coming) Dr. Lenders arrived. I made way for him, as he was Mr. Joynes’ friend and doctor. He examined him all over, and also was of opinion he was partly stunned. I went out and saw Mr. Wilson, and as robberies* had been very rife in the town I suggested to him to examine the * See Summary for January 1913, —lo. ^ went into Mr. Joynes’ mom,and found the small safe all right. We went back to Mr. Joynes, and as he was slightly restless, and groaning, and appeared partly conscious Mr. Wilson said &lt;c Don’t worry Joynes, the safe is all right. ” Mr. Joynes then again mumbled the “ Safe ”, the “ Safe ”. As there appeared to be some credible evidence, that perhaps a revolver had been fired although the watchmen had not heard a report Mr. Wilson, Mr. Levack and myself went downstairs into the inner court yard and along to the recess (under a verandah) where the firm’s large safe is kept and which is situated only a few paces from where Mr. Joynes was found lying- When vre got to the safe we found the door wide open with the safe key which was attached to a bunch of keys, in No. 1 lock and a trouser chain hanging loosely from the key ring with the leather tag torn through. The inner door, which also locks was open, and one of the drawers was unlocked, and half open. A super ficial examination proved that all the gold (Turkish Liras) had been stolen. The firm had received in cash that morning some 300 or 400 Turkish Liras, proceeds of sales of oil. We made a hasty examination everywhere, and found the door leading to the roof open, and we presumed the thieves had escaped that way (a very easy pro ceeding). We then proceeded upstairs, and I told Mr. Wilson at once to send for the Turkish police, and I would send the 1st Dragoman along to be present, wdiile the police investigated the matter. When I left, Mr. Joynes was lying in a dazed state on the sofa. It was agreed that it would be unwise to move him, and Mr. Barter one of his intimate friends volunteered to stay the night with him. The Dragoman stayed with the police until 2 a.m. Next morning I went personally to Strick’s office, and saw the Examining Magistrate (Mustantiq) and Mr. Wilson. When I arrived, Mr. Joynes had been taken home in a carriage, and put to bed. We made again a tour of all the premises, but could find no traces of thieves. However, this was not surprising, as the ground was hard and dry. From the roof it was abundantly evident that the thieves could with great facility have escaped in many different directions. I asked the Mustantiq to take the evidence of the neighbours, and he promised to do so. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Nersessian, our 1st Dragoman then told me Mr. Joynes although still very ill had endeavour ed to explain to the Mustantiq how the robbery had occurred. Mr. Joynes said that at first in the afternoon he was working, writing letters for the mail, and that subsequently he had opened the small safe in his office, and commenced sorting the cash (£ T. 300 to 400), which the firm had received that morning. Then noticing that it was getting dark, as he had received orders from his chief not to leave money in the small safe overnight he collected the bags, and went down to the large safe stituated in a recess in the inner courtyard. He proceeded to open the large safe, and had just pulled one drawer out when he was attacked from behind by a man holding a knife in his hand. The assailant he said put his arm over his mouth. They struggled together, and Mr. Joynes managed to seize his wrists, and forced him out of the recess. At that moment Mr. Joynes heard a noise at his back, and he turned his head instinc tively, and at the same time involuntarily loosing his grip over his first assailant. Almost simultaneously the man behind him struck him a blow on the head with something heavy and soft like a sand bag, and the first assailant pulling a revol ver from his pocket fired at him. The flash of the revolver was the last thing he remembered before losing consciousness, I then learnt that the police had found his double collar (this had been taken off by some one the night before previous to my arrival), and that it had two cuts in it on the left side, and the left sleeve of his jacket also had cuts in it. Ike police had taken away his jacket and collar. Mr. Joynes described his first assailant as a short thick set man with dark Jbair, wearing European clothes, and a fez—a description, which tallied somewhat with one of the clerks in Strick’s office.8 It seemed fairly clear that someone ydth an interior knowledge of the work ing of the office must have planned the robbery, and possibly have opened, or caused to be opened the door leading to the roof, which is usually kept shut. Looking back on it now, I do not doubt that if this incident had happened #\ in London, Mr. Joynes would probably have been arrested almost immediately. In Baghdad, however, no European gave the possibility of his guilt a thought at the commencement. Two doctors from the Municipality asked permission to see Mr. Joynes, with Dr. Lenders, and I heard he was suffering from slight concussion of the brain. On Tuesday, February 11th, I received a note from Mr. Joynes that he did not wish to postpone bis marriage, and that he hoped to be able to come to the Residency wuth his bride, and a few friends at 2 p.m. Mr. Joynes posed as a Protestant converted to Roman Catholicism, and he brought a letter of recommendation from Cardinal \ aughan to the Carmelite Fathers. His fiancee, Miss Sommer, is a Protestant, He gave out that the Carmelite Fathers insisted on his obtaining a dispensation to enable him to marry a Protestant, and that in any case his fiancee disliked the idea of a reli gious ceremony in the Roman Catholic church. Under the circumstances, a compromise was agreed to, whereby their marriage was to be solemnised at the British Consulate-General, by the civil ceremony only. At 2-15 p.m. Mr. Joynes arrived looking very ill, and limping slightly. He informed me he felt a numb ness and weakness in his left arm and leg, which Dr.. Lenders told him was due to the blow he had received on his head. In the presence of Mrs. Scott, Mr. and Mrs. Levack, Mr. Barter and Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Thaddeus, the head clerk, he was duly married by me. Someone said jokingly “The rumour in the Bazar is that you robbed the safe yourself Joynes ” and everyone laughed. Meanwhile, Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Company, Limited had written me an official complaint about the robbery, and also telegraphed to their London Office. I telegraphed informing His Excellency the Ambassador, and also wrote to the Vilayet a letter drawing their attention to the robbery, and asking them to use every endeavour to arrest the thieves, and recover the money, now said to amount to not less than £T. 700. The same morning, February llth, Mr. Wright found the empty cartridge case of a Webley Scott or Browning pistol cartridge in a puddle of water near the well, and close to where Mr. Joynes was discovered. Nothing of moment occurred until Saturday morning, February 15th, when Mr. Wilson called on me, and told me he had heard that at a dinner in Meissner Pasha's house the previous evening Roudret Bey, the Directeur des Affaires Politiques stated before an astonished table that Mr. Joynes had committed the robbery himself, and Lutfi Bey the Assistant Wall on being appealed to said it was true I am told by those, who were present that an uncomfortable pause followed,' and that all the Europeans present were quite incredulous. Mr Wilson called on Mr. Joynes, and the latter was highly indignant, and said he was prepared to bring an action for slander against the two Turkish officials. I told (for even then I did not suspect Mr. Joynes) Mr. Wilson and Mr. Joynes that the affair was a delicate one, and one in which I personally could not move, but that their best course was to call together on Meissner Pasha. This they did and Meissner Pasha was quite frank about it, and regretted such a painful accusation should have been made by a Turkish official against any European in his house. , _ l . n On Sunday, February 16th, Mr. Joynes was taken more seriously ill, being he said completely paralysed on the left side. In the evening, Dr. Lenders, who was a great friend of Mr. Joynes, sent for me, and told me that in his opinion Mr. Joynes 5 paralysis was feigned, but feigned with great skill*9 I visited him at once, with Dr. Lenders, and when I left, I also had real doubts as to the genuineness of his paralysis. This changed the whole aspect of the case. A man capable of simulating a paralysis is probably a man capable of com nitting other frauds. On Monday, February 17th, I began a careful investigation myself. I went to Mr. Joynes* house with the 1st Dragoman, and took down his statement on oath, and subjected him to a rigorous cross-examination. The account he gave of the struggle, the trivial nature of the injuries, his failure to call for help, which was so near, and his failure to have asked the watchman to accompany him down to the safe with a lantern still further aroused my suspicions. Incidentally, I noted that in the excitement of answering my questions he wa s moving his paralysed arm. I then took the sworn statements of everyone in Strick’s office. One of the watchmen established to my satisfaction that the door leading to tk e roof was firmly shut with a strong iron bar fitting into an iron socket after all the clerks had left on Sunday. I also satisfied myself it could not be opened from outside. Mr. Joynes pretended that he had opened the small safe in his room, taken out five or six bags of money, shut the safe, and carried them “ in a pile in his two hands ” downstairs. If it were true, that meant a pause at the office door, which was shut, placing the bags on the ground, as they could not be held in one hand, picking them up again, and shutting the door, which he described as “ kicking to with his foot. ,, Now, Mrs. Joynes (Miss Sommer) said she never heard him leaving the room. Mr.'J'oynes had also made a mysterious visit to his house in the middle of the afternoon of that Sunday, February 9th, leaving Mrs. Joynes alone for 15 minutes, or so in Strick’s office. I formed the opinion (in point of fact correct) that Mr. Joynes had carried the money to his house at that time, and that when he slipped out of the room later he had carried away no money. On the other hand he must have stealthily crept up the roof stairs, and opened the roof door, and then gone downstairs, cut his neck, his hand, his collar, and his coat, and opened the safe, and possibly fired off a pistol. It was now clear in my mind that Mr. Joynes was guilty, but I argued he must somehow have got rid of a knife, and possibly a revolver. The well seemed the likely place, and at 1 p.m., on Thursday, February 20th, a diver after much trouble brought up a Webley Scott pistol, and a razor. I at once sent privately for Mr. Barter, Mr. Joynes’ friend, and on oath he at once identified the pistol, as one Mr. Joynes had b/ought from Mr. Ferguson. The pistol had been repaired at Musal, and the two sides were of a different pattern. I then prepared the Warrant for Mr. Joynes’ arrest, and also a Search Warrant. At 8-45 p.m. accompanied by Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Whitley, and with the Dragomen, and the Head Clerk in attendance leaded on Mr. Joynes. He had just finished dinner. He came into his little drawing room, neatly dressed in his dinner jacket, still limping, and looking ghastly white. I asked Mrs. Joynes to leave us alone for a minute. Mr. Joynes quite cool said, “ To what do I owe the honour of this visit.” I said to him, “ There is no more doubt, Joynes, that you committed this robbery. Will you hand us back the money, which you have taken.” At first, he tried bluster and bluff, and asked me what I was going to do. I said. “ I am going to arrest you.” He then confessed, and he indicated to us, where we would find thres bags of gold, containing in all £T. 441. These bags w T ere marked with Strick, Scott and Company’s name. I then had to break the news to his newly wedded wife. It was a scene too pain ful to describe. Briefly, Mr. Joynes was taken away by me, and imprisoned in the C. 806 FDResidency. I immediately returned having left the 1st Dragoman in the house. As a result of a search in the house that night, and the next day, some startling discoveries were made, e.g., many signed business letters of the firm, relating to money never despatched, others torn up, used telegraph envelopes addressed to deJuignes, envelopes in his handwriting, addressed to the Duchess of Devonshire and Lady \\ inifred Curzon. From inscriptions in books, references in letters, I became suspicious that he was already married. The Manager of the Eastern Bank, Limited, supplied me with the information that he was regularly transmitting money by telegram to a Mrs. Joynes, Dowlands Park Farm, Smallfield near Horley, Surrey, and also to a Mrs. Joynes at 10 Wray Crescent, Holloway. The former of these ladies would appear to be his wife, and the latter his mother. Mr. Joynes now stands charged with larceny, embezzlement and fraudulent false accounting. When I can be supplied with legal proof sufficient to establish the genuineness of the first marriage, I will charge Mr. Joynes in addition with bigamy. , I am now taking the preliminary examination in regard to the first charge. Exactly what sums of money he has stolen, or embezzled can only be ascertained, when the books of the firm are reconstructed, but it will exceed £ T. 1,000. A superficial glance reveals the fact that the books are both deficient and false, and they cannot be correctly audited in their present condition. Needless to say Mr. Joynes has no private means, nor has he ever been to Harrow or Cambridge, although on a.visit to Mohammerah he imposed on many men, who have been educated at one or both institutions. Among the British colony general sympathy and pity have been extended to Miss Sommer (Mrs. Joynes). Messrs. Lynch have offered her a free passage to Basrah, and Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, Limited, a free passage to England. Mr. Joynes debased himself even so far as to barrow £ T. 27 out of the £ T. 45 Miss Sommer had succeeded in saving from her earnings^ saying his quarterly allow ance from England had not yet arrived. The native inhabitants, and unfortunately many of the foreigners regard Miss Sommer, as a sort of accomplice of Mr. Joynes. I am glad to have this opportunity of rebutting such an unwarranted accusation, both unjustifiable and unjustified. She has been cruelly deceived, and taken advantage of by a clever and unscrupu lous criminal. The chief responsibility for this unfortunate affair undoubtedly lies with Messrs. Strick, Scott, and Company, Limited, London. They must have been either grossly deceived or grossly careless. The man has admitted that he has been “ a crook ” all his life. A large share of the responsibility, however, also lies on the shoulders of Messrs. Stirck, Scott and Company’s late Baghdad Manager, Mr. R. 0. Harvey. A superficial examination of the firm’s books shows that no sort of even element ary supervision has been practised by the head of the firm, some of the books having no entry in them since May 1912. Mr. Wilson’s arrival in Januifry last brought things to a head as he was con stantly pressing Mr. Joynes to shew him all the books written up to date, and wished to check the balance of cash in the firm’s safes. Mr. Joynes took the opportunity of also embezzling £ 40 of Mr. Harvey’s private money, and £30 belonging to Mr. Wilson. The real effect of this scandal is difficult to judge locally. There is, however, no doubt it has come as a great shock to many of the native inhabitants here that an Englishman could be capable of such conduct. On the other hand it demonstrates to them that we as a nation do not shrink from arresting, and punishing wrong-doers, even though they are Englishmen, and regarded as such, it is a useful object lesson to the local autho rities. 2. The Mesopotamian Irrigation works still remain all but closed down.It is, however, understood by Sir John Jackson’s representative that the loan with the National Bank of Turkey will shortly be concluded, when the works will be put in full swing again. HI.— British Indian Cases and Interests. 1. His Excellency the Ambassador has informed me by telegram that Saiyid Muhammad Husain {alias Saiyid Faraj) has the right to submit a petition to the Court of Cessation, through the Public Prosecutors of Karbala and Baghdad, * See summary for January 1913, III. —3. asking that the hearing of his case* be transferred to another Court. I have ins tructed the Vice-Consul at Karbala in this sense. 2. The cases of robbery of Bohra pilgrims occurred, one case near Karbala, and another case near Najaf. The Vice-Consul at Karbala has taken energetic action in both cases, and some of the property in both cases was recovered from the thieves. I drew the Wali s attention to the matter, and asked him that steps might, if possible, be taken to recover the balance of the property missing. IV .—British Official Matters. 1. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ghulam Muhammad arrived here on February 19th, on his way to take up his appointment at Kermanshah. 2. The R. I. M. S. ‘ Comet*” left here for Mohammerah, on February 26th, to meet Mr. J. G. Lorimer, C. I. E., I. C. S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, who was expected to arrive there fr6m India on March 13th. V.— Persian Affairs. Nil VI.— Other Foreign Interests. Nil V II.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. Meissner Pasha the other day very kindly showed me over the depot of the Baghdad Railway Company at Baghdad. On the whole, I was astonished to see how little has really been accomplish ed, since the opening of the Railway last July. On the river front at ‘‘ Sinn ”, which is nearly opposite this Residency, on the right bank of the Tigris, some piles have been driven in, and a sort of pier has been built with an 8-ton travelling crane on top. This enables them to unload the barges directly. From the other end of the pier, a set of rails has been laid for half-a-mile in the direction of where tpe future station will be situated, about 1 mile from the river bank. A contractor’s engine shunts the trucks about. Its whistle and general movements create great interest among the inhabitants, and there is always a large crowd on the public path near the railway watching its operations. Some large storehouses have been built for wood, tools, cement, etc., and also a small hospital. One or two houses for the staff have also been constructed. The question of the expropriation of the land for the goods yard, and the port of Baghdad has not yet been settled. Meissner Pasha said it would cost the Railway Company at least one million marks. The railway embankments, as far as Samarra, are now, I hear, completed, and they have begun building the small bridges and culverts with reinforced concrete. Meissner Pasha has not been granted his leave to Europe, but may, I hear be permitted to go as far as Aleppo.12 There is no doubt work for one reason or another is going on very slowly. Several of the Engineers, whose contracts with the Railway Company have expired, are leaving, as they have not been re-engaged. I learn very confidentially from a reliable source that it is thought the Bagh dad Railway in its present form is unlikely to be completed, and that its itinerary will have to be changed, so as to pass by Khanaqin, Kerkuk, Musal and Diarbekir. The materials are being brought up from Basrah by the tugs “Samarra ” and “ Tekrit ” of the Baghdad Railway Company, and by the “ Pioneer ”, which be longs, I believe, to Messrs Y' onckhaus and Company. The tug “ Samarra ” was originally intended to convey the railway materials from Baghdad to Samarra, but that idea has now been abandoned. The tug “ Tekrit ” was meant for use in the port of Basrah. The “ Shirm ”, one of the English-built tugs of the Societe de Transports Fluviauxen Orient, is also working, and brings up two barges of 800 tons each. NORMAN SCOTT, Major, I. M. S., British Residency and Consulate-General, Baghdad ; The 4th March 1913. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Acting Poli tical Resident in Turkish Arabia, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad. ANNEXURE A. Translation of a Mazbata of Basra Notables addressed to the Acting Vali Grand Vizier, Minister of Interior. Our greatest national wish is to assure the future of the country, and to advance the condition and affairs of the community. Impelled by our national and social needs, we submit with deep concern, for your consideration, the following matters Under the impact, and the deepest sorrow, and emotion, we beg to state that we have wept till we can weep no more over the present ruin of our beloved country, the coveted prey of our enemies, who are ever endeavouring to wrest it from us. Wherever we look, the dark clouds of ruin, misfortune, deaths and certain cala mity are plainly seen settling over us like a pall. Both great and small, afflicted, enlightened, or mute, we are to-day, all in one condition of existence. Science, education, commerce, agriculture, and Art, in all their branches, have perished, and are buried deep in the misfortunes of ignorance. Poverty and indigence have seized our whole community in their grasp, and are dragging us along to our destruction. Families, which once supported large numbers of the poor and needy, are to-day themselves in poverty and distress. In short, we are crushed and weighed down by the burden of an abasement, which we cannot endure. What is the sole reason for this condition, this abject humiliation. We have pondered and found one basic source of it, from which spring causes, as widely ramified, as they are beyond computation, and this is the fact, that, in our sphere, science Lnd education, and all they mean are utterly obliterated. Consequently, as the treatment of a malady is indubitably rendered easier by an accurate diagnosis, we beg and request you, in the name of the country and 'the nation, to grant us permission to convene, in extraordinary session, and without a moment’s delay, a General Council of the Yilayat, the formation of which is not merely necessary, but of paramount and pressing importance in order to arrest once and for all the ruin, the misfortune, the poverty and the needs, hich oppress us in the way I have stated, and, while indicating the definite necessity which exists for the discussion of all matters affecting the knowledge, education wealth and prosperity of our people, and country, for passing our decisions thereon, and for taking such steps as may be necessary to carry them out we beg you, in view of the urgency of these concerns, which are matters of Vfe or^death to our people and our country, to authorise the issue of a summons t assemble the General Council of the Vilayat in immediate and extraordinary Session, without regard to the usual time fixed for its meetingANNEXITRE B. Translation of Circular, issued in Mosul on February 18th, 1913, for the purpose of encouraging subscriptions to the Internal Loan. The Governments of Greece, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro, have made a secret agreement to seize our sacred country, and to plunder our property, and capture our children, and our families, and suddenly declared war on us four months ago ; and they have taken advantage of the weakness of our numbers to invade the greater part of our land in Roumelia and the Islands, until they have reached the very gates of Stamboul. And having invaded these lands they now wish to invade Stamboul also, and the rest of our country. But our Government has striven to defend itself in every way, and our army has tried to wipe out the stain on its honour, and the people living near the seat of war have partaken in it, and every one everywhere has subscribed towards the War Fund. For the purpose of our ene mies is the purpose of oppression ; for in the lands they have invaded they have killed more than half the population, sparing neither young nor old nor women, and they have plundered all their possessions and goods, and they poured oil in the mosques, where the people have taken refuge, and burnt them ; and even now they are practising cruelties, which pass belief. Our Government is striving with all its might to recover the invaded lands, and to rescue their unhappy inhabitants, and thanks be to God Most High, who has recently granted us some victories. But the war has seriously increased expenditure, and our Government has decided to issue an internal loan of five hundred million piastres, and the Treasury has issued Bonds, the security for which is the property tax. And the value of a bond of 100 piastres is 120 piastres, or an English pound, and they are also issued for half the amount : and the capital and interest is divided into five coupons, which will be paid yearly on the 30th Tashrin-i-sani, and coupons will be paid in cash by the Finance Departments of the Empire, and they will be received in lieu of cash in payment of taxes. Until the bonds arrive, certificates for the amount required will be issued by the hinance Department. In every country patriotic people are hastening to buy these bonds, thereby assuring their own profit, and helping the needs of the Treasury. So, noble people and patriots, we invite you to show your patriotism by buying these bonds, that we may save our sacred land from the tyranny of our enemies. As we are far from the seat of war, and cannot assist in person, we must assist with our money ; for if we strive not to repulse our enemies, they will succeed in their aims, and the cruelties, which they are doing there they will do here, and they will not be content with your money and your property, but will assail your persons and your honour. Consider this well, people of sense !CONFIDENTIAL. Summary of Events in Turkish ’Iraq for January (received 26fh February) 1913. I.—Internal Affairs. . , !' The Wali sent his aide-de-camp on New Year’s Day to offer me his congra- tu ations. The Assistant Wall, and a large number of the other high Turkish officials, called on me m person. All the Consuls, and the greater proportion of the European colony, and many of the Baghdad Notables, also paid me a congratu- latory visit. I made a friendly return call on the French, German, and American Consuls, and also on Meissner Pasha. On January 14th (the Orthodox New Year), I paid a similar congratulatory visit on the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Consuls. J 2. A private and confidential memorandum, printed in London, has come *See Summary for September 1912—II, 6. u t0 , ^ P 0SSeSsi ° n ’ 0n tiie Subject of the -Baghdad Tramways and Electric* Lighting Syndicate, Limited. The Directors are :—- Mr. J. G. B. Stone (Chairman), 6, Crosby Square, London, E.C. Mr. W. B. Cownie, 3, Lawrence Poimtney Hill, London, E.C. Mr. T. H. Evans, 4, Broad Street Place, London, E.C. Dr. Kurt Loewenfeld, 13, Pall Mall, Manchester. The Secretary (and registered office) :— Mr. E. A. Bond, 3, Lawrence Pountney Hill, London, E.C. The preamble states that the Syndicate was formed on 12th September 1912 i to take over an Agreement between Mahmoud Shahbander of Baghdad, the Conces- / sionaire for the Tramways and Electric lighting in Baghdad, and Mr. W. B. Cownie, mentioned above. The nominal capital of the Syndicate is stated to be £3 lOs' divided into 3,000 “ A ” shares of £1 each ; 600 “ B ” shares of Is each, and 1 500 ordinary shares of Is. each. This amount has already been subscribed. By the creation of 12,000 “ A ” shares of £1 each, and 900 “ B ” shares of Is. each, it is now proposed to increase the capital to £15,150. A report has been prepared by Mr. F. H. Parshall, consulting engineer of Salisbury House, London. This report is of a glowing and sanguine nature, and estimates the profits, per annum, to be derived from the tramways and electric lighting schemes, as not less than £73,150. The actual cash required for construc tion, engineering fees, etc., is put down as £450,000. Mr. Parshall, however, remarks that substantially greater profits than those mentioned above are to be anticipated. The concession will be secured by providing a bank guarantee for, or putting up a deposit of £10,000. It is proposed to form an English Holding Company with a Debenture capital of approximately £550,000. Five per cent, debentures of £100 each are to be issued at a price to realise about £82J net in order to provide the cash required. In addition, there will be a share capital of £400,000. The National Electric Construction Company, who, it is said by their Chief Engineer, have carefully gone into the estimates on the spot, are prepared to carry out the works for the sum of £450,000, mentioned above. The Concessionaire, Mahmoud Shahbander, is to obtain 40,000 shares in the Turkish company (which was to have been formed within four months of the option C742FD ^5 I'M i 4 \\2 Mi being exercised, if War had not occurred, and which has the right of another four months formation time at the expiry of the War), and £3,800 in cash to cover his incidental expenses. With the exception of these 40,000 shares, all the remaining shares will be held by the hmglish Company. On this basis the profit which should accrue to the English company on its holding, is estimated at £56,572 per annum, after having provided for the Muni- cipality s share of surplus profits. 1 l furtlier C{ jlculated”that, after paying 6% on the 550,000 Debentures'of £100 each, a sum of £23,000 would remain over for the London expenses and for the ordinary shareholders. The concession is for a period of 50 years, to date from March 1912. The undertaking is to be free from all taxations, but the Municipality parti cipate m the surplus profits, after the Company has been credited with interest at the rate of 5j% per annum. The terms of the Concession are :—- (1) 1 ramways.—ln addition to four obligatory lines (details of routes not given), the Concessionaire may construct any other lines within a radius of 10 Kilometres measured from the Serai for a period of 10 years, after which the Government has the right to grant permis sion to other parties. All w idenings on the obligatory lines inside the town are to be carried out at the expense of the Municipality. The company propose, in order to secure C at the widenings are promptly executed, to advance a loan to the Municipality, taking as security the Municipality’s interest in the surplus profits. The tramways may be for the transport of passengers or merchandise. (2) Lighting—T \iq Concessionaire is granted exclusive right of establishing and maintaining, within the actual limits of the town of Baghdad, all works necessary for the distribution of electrical energy, with the following reservations :— {a) Installations of telephones or telegraphs. (6) Installations to supply electrical energy for enterprises of transport other than the system of tramways. (c) Installations, which the State may wish to erect for strategic pur poses. &amp; r {d) Installations necessary for the supply of electrical energy for the working of the port of Baghdad. All the cables may be overhead. The Municipality, it is stated, guarantee a minimum of £2,000, per annum for lighting by electricity, and, in addition, the Company count on obtaining all the street lighting, and also the lighting of many private houses. The sole illuminants, at present available in Baghdad, are kerosine oil and candles. The Baghdad Municipality have hitherto proved themselves an incompetent effete, and usually bankrupt body, and I think the company, if it ever comes to anything, have, as far as the four obligatory lines inside the town are concerned, a difficult undertaking. In regard to the lines outside the town, much will depend how the arrival of the railway will effect the distribution, and grouping of the population, as regards the two banks of the Tigris. 3. Humours of the Wali’s resignation continue. These have strengthened since the return of the Committee of Union and Progress to power. Muhammad Pasna Daghistani is said to have refused the post. 4 4. A letter has teen received here by Shaikh Mubdir-el-Firaun, head of the A1 Fatta tribe, from one Saiyid Ahmad Misri, who is at Menama in Bahrein. Thepurport of the letter is that the Shaikh of Bahrein is so weak and afraid of the English that Christian Missions are distributing their harmful and poisonous publi- ! cations among Muhammadans. 5. The Shaikhs of the Nomadic tribes in the Vilayets of Baghdad and Basrah ' are, it is sa:d, preparing to send a committee to London, to ask the British Govern ment to annex this part of Turkey. 6. The educational club at Baghdad, the “ Nadil’ ilm,” has started a course of evening lessons. Five languages are being taught, viz., Turkish, Arabic, English, French and German. Most of the scholars, who attend, are Muhammadans. 7. On January 16 th, the AVali telegraphed to the Minister of the Interior that the Nizam troops, Bediffs, Officials, and, in fact, people of all classes in Iraq were anxious to go to the seat of War, if ordered to do so. On January 18th, Kiamil Pasha replied, thanking the people of this Vilayet for the zeal they displayed in wishing to assist their country, but that at present volunteers were not required. 8. Up to January 19th, £ T. 1,884 have been subscribed here for the War Relief Fund. 9. Over 100 Persian subjects in Kazimain and Baghdad have applied to the Turkish authorities to become Ottoman subjects. 10. On January 19th, under orders from the Wali, the police raided the pre mises of the Club of the Committee of Union and Progress, and made a perqui sition there. It is understood from a confidential source that the Wali received orders from Constantinople to trace a letter sent or received by the Baghdad branch of the Committee of Union and Progress, on June 16th 1912. Whether the search was successful is not known. Many members of the Baghdad blanch, including the headmaster of the Committee’s school, at once resigned. 11. A letter, dated January 5th, from the War Relief Commission of Basrah, addressed to the Baghdad War Relief Comurission, intimates that the inhabitants of Bahrein, including Shaikh ’Abdul Wahhab ez Zayyani have subscribed the sum of 7,500 Turkish pounds for the relief of the sufferers, and have sent the money to Basrah. Altogether, Saiyid Talib Effendi, the Naqib of Basrah, calculates he has re- \ ceived, since the opening of the fund up to the present date, £ T. 36,000 given by the Arab inhabitants of the Basrah Vilayet, and the Persian Gulf. 12. On January 23rd, the Wali sent a telegraphic request to Constantinople asking the authorities there to permit of wheat and flour from foreign countries being imported into this Vilayet, free of duty, as the local price of grain has risen so much. 13. The chief political event of the month here, as no doubt elsewhere in the Ottoman dominions, was the news (first telegraphed to me by His Excellency the Ambassador) of the violent overthrow of the Ministry of Kiamil Pasha by the Committee of Union and Progress, with Enver Bey at their head, and which led to the death of Nazim Pasha. This coup d'etat has so far left the people of ’Iraq very indifferent, even cold. It would appear that the policy of the Committee has few real adherents or sup porters in Mesopotamia. They neither second the action of the Committee’s leaders, nor do they respond to the impassioned appeals published in the Com mittee’s local newspapers. The death of Nazim Pasha, who only a few days previously, it was rumoured had been nominated Gazi or Conqueror, is, without exception, condemned here! His loss is genuinely mourned by a large section of the Baghdad public, who, iii spite of his shortcomings, esteemed and respected him. The serious and reasoning element of the population here are of opinion that this sudden change of Ministry and policy at such a critical moment in the historyof Turkey can eventually only weaken her position, and, perhaps, lead to still fur ther territorial losses, and humiliations. 14. On January 25th, the Club of the Baghdad branch of the Committee of Union and Progress, which after the *See Secuon io above. police* visit to which it was subjected earlier in the month, again opened its doors. Workmen were seen mending the broken panes of glass in the windows. 15. Public security in Baghdad town has greatly diminished again. Re ports of robberies are almost of daily occurrence, especially in the Jewish quarter. I understand a Turkish “ Bimbashi ” was held up in broad daylight, by an armed band, and robbed of everything, including his uniform and sword. A similar band entered a rich Jewish merchant’s house at night, and stole every thing he possessed, including the mattings on the floor. Saleh Effendi, an ex-inspector of police of the Baghdad Municipality, in order to give the present Mudir of Police an ocular demonstration of the inefficiency of the force of which he is the head, advised, it is said, some notorious thieves, on the night of January 24th, to enter the Mudir’s house. The thieves took the advice, and a good deal of the Mudir’s property, but their identity has not yet been dis covered. 16. The Baghdad branch of the Committee of Union and Progress has pub lished a manifesto of an exciting character in Turkish and Arabic. The purport of this declaration is that only the late Nazim Pasha is to blame for the defeat of the Turkish Arms. The Turkish nation has protested (presumably by killing him), and has become young and vigorous again. Every Muhammadan’s duty is to give every thing he possesses to the Govern ment, and he must be determined to die, if necessary, for his country. Battalions of volunteers must be formed, and the whole nation must be pre pared to fight. 17. The “ Zuhur ” newspaper, the Committee’s organ, says in one of its articles that one of the worst mistakes made by the late Cabinet was to appoint a Christian, as Foreign Minister, an occurrence, which had never previously happened in the history of Turkey. 18. His Excellency the British Ambassador telegraphed me on January 14th that an embargo had been placed on the export of cereals from Mesopotamia, but that cereals, which had been purchased before January 12th, would still be free to be exported. The embargo on the export of cereals from Musal to Baghdad was said to have been withdrawn. A case occurred in which the local authorities of Khanaqin prevented the export of barley purchased by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in July from being exported to Chia Suxkh. The Wali at first demurred to telegraphing instructions, but on my pressing him he gave way, and the barley was allowed to be exported. Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company, British merchants, however, cannot obtain their supplies of barley from their agents at Altun Kupri and Tel-es-Shaer in the Musal Vilayet. I have telegraphed to the British Vice-Consul at Musal to ask him to represent the matter to the Wali of Musal. 19. Mr. Crow, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, reports that on a decision of the Council of State the Minister of the Interior ordered the acting Wali of Basrah to have a search made in certain houses, inhabited by members of the Basrah branch of the Committee of Union and Progress. The houses visited by the Police were those of :— (1) Yusuf Effendi Diab, representative of the Committee. (2) Abdul Nabi, mumeyiz of the Mektoubji’s office.(3) The premises' of Union and Progress Club. (4) Muhammad el Asayimi. (5) Mustafa Bey. A quantity of papers were confiscated, including correspondence with members of the Committee, papers, relating to the Vilayet, a copy of the Government cypher, and a special and private cypher used by Abdul Nabi for communicating with offi cials at Amara. A commission has been appointed to hold an enquiry into the contents of the papers. 20. Mr. Crow further reports that, on January 26th, the Arab notables of Basrah assembled in considerable numbers at the house of Saiyid Talib Bey, and drew up a Mazbata, which they signed and sealed on oath. The purport of the Mazbata is that political party differences have brought Turkey to the verge of ruin. Henceforth, as Arabs, they will side neither with the Committee of Union and Progress, nor with Liberals, but will devote their efforts to the cause of Turkey, as a whole, without party distinction. 21. Mr. Crow also informs me that, on January 30th, the 111th regiment left for Amara by the SS. “Burhanieh”, in order. Mr. Crow is informed, to compel the Arab Shaikhs, holding Government land contracts, to pay the arrears due by them to Government. The Shaikhs have, it is said, refused to comply. 22. Shaikh Mubarek of Koweit, who is at present at Basrah in his yacht, in view of the fall of the Kiamil Ministry, regrets, it is said, his donation of £ T. 11,000 to the war fund. 23. The Turkish mail between Musal and Baghdad was attacked, and a bag containing £ T. 270 stolen. Gendarmes from Khaniqin made a fruitless pursuit. 24. A financial inspector, Mr. Jamjian, an Armenian, has arrived at Baghdad from Constantinople, to inspect the accounts of the Vilayet. He has sealed the Accountant-General’s books. • II.—British Interests and Cases. 1. Sir John Jackson, Limited, have now received £ T. 20,000* from the local _ , „ TT , revenues of the Baghdad Vilayet, and ' Su Summary fot D;,oember 1912 - I,&gt;1 - £ T. 3,400 from the revenues of the Basrah Vilayet. His Excellency the Ambassador telegraphed me, on January 23rd, that Sir John Jackson was in negotiation with the National Bank of Turkey for a loan. The recent coup d’etat, however, has no doubt interfered with its conclusion. Meanwhile, the works are all but shut down, a mere minimum of work being carried out. I understand from Sir John Jackson’s representative that Sir John Jackson is again temporarily finding the money to keep the work going. 2. The Customs here refused to pass 375 loaded sporting cartridges destined in transit for the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Kirmanshah. The for mer Manager had been successful in getting loaded cartridges through. The Customs handed them over to the Military Authorities, who confiscated them. As a result of telegraphic correspondence, His Excellency the Ambassador informed me loaded cartridges are not allowed to be impoijbd into the Ottoman dominions even in transit. On the other hand, as the goods were clearly manifested, the Customs ought to have delivered them to the importer s agent for return to the port of origin. HI.—British Indian Interests and Cases. X. The Bidayet Court, in spite of constant reminders on the part of the Residency Dragoman has not yet fixed a date for the t S« Summary for December 1912-111,1. hearing o{ the ca gej of the assailants of Saiyid Muhammad, son of Azim Shah.2. I learn by telegram that an attack was made, near Karbala, on a carriage containing Bohra pilgrims. I sent the Residency Dragoman at once to the Wall to protest, and, at the same time, telegraphed to the Vice-Consul for a full re port. 3. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala informs me by letter that, in his opinion, Saiyid Muhammad Husain 1 '' {alias Saiyid *See Summary for December 1912 III, 2. is havill g a most biased re-trial. The deceased Haji Husain’s employer, Saiyid Qasim Reshti, is leaving no stone unturned to ensure the Court re-convicting Saiyid Muhammad Hussain {alias Saiyid F;.raj). The Vice-Consul makes the serious charge against the Court that the clerks do not correctly write down the depositions, and answers of the witnesses. It will be necessary for me to bring this matter to the notice of His Excellency the Ambassador, by telegram. IV. —British Official Matters. 1. No satisfaction h«^s yet been obtained from the Vilayet for the robberyj' committed on Mr. E. B. Soane by three t£ee Summary for December 1912 —iv, 3. armed Arabs, near Khan-i-Chul, nor have his assailants been able to be traced. V. —Persian Affairs. 1. I have received no news from Kirmanshah this month. Trade, however, continues very slack between Baghdad and Persia, partly, owing to the continued insecurity of the roads, and the heavy exactions of the load guards, but chiefly owing to the high price of transport due to the scarcity of mules, as the Military Authorities have requisitioned large numbers of these animals. 2. His Excellency the Ambassador enquired from me by telegram, on January 8th, whether it was a fact that the Turks had sent troops to occupy Persian territory near or to the north of Kasr-i-Shirin. I replied in the negative. Mr. E. B. Soane has just informed me by letter that he has found out that the rumour was purposely circulated by Samsam-ul-Mamalik (Governor of Kasr-i- Shirin) to the Governor-General of Kirmanshah in order to extort money for extra horsemen from the latter. Mr. Soane adds that no Turkish aggressions have taken place. 3. Mr. Soane, whom, in view of his serious illness, I had pressed to come to Bagh dad, replies to me as follows:— “I should very much like to pay a visit to Baghdad, but it is quite impossible to leave here with all th i tribes around us, and the condition of things the acme of insecurity. Some of the Chiefs, who are very friendly, have been so frank as to tell me that if I go they will not hesitate to attack the place. “ The other day a rumour got about that I was going and not returning, and half the staff came to resign ’ ’. 4. On January 27th, I was able to forward to His Excellency the Ambassador a sketch map of the Tuxco-Persian frontier J ISee Summary for December 1912 —v, i. f r0 m Shemiran to Mandali, embodying the conclusions arrived at during the conference between Mons. Orlow, the Russian Consul-General, and Mr. E. B. Soane. I also enclosed some additional remarks and explanations made by Mr Soane, after having shewn them to Mons. Or low. VI. —Other Foreign Interests. 1. The birthday of His Imperial Majesty the German Emperor was celebrated on January 27th. The Residency flagstaff and the R. I. M. S. “Comet” were dressed for the occasion. The acting German Consul held no official reception, but I paid him a private congratulatory visit.VII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. Mr. A. D. Younghusband, lately Commissioner of Sind, and Mrs. Young- husband, paid a short visit to Baghdad. They visited Babylon, Karbala, and the Hindie Barrage, 2. Two American gentlemen (brothers), Messrs. Popenoe, are now at Baghdad, studying date cultivation. I understand they have been all round the Persian Gulf on a similar mission. They are taking away, it is said, many date “suckers” to be sent to California. NORMAN SCOTT, Major, British Residency &amp; Consulate- His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul, General : , , / Acting Political Resident in Turkish f Arabia, and His Britannic Majesty's Dated Baghdad, the ith February 1913. ) Consul-General, Baghdad,WBBtm I.—Internal Affairs. 1. The Wah Muhammad Zaki Pasha, who has the rank of Field Marshal, carries on the duties of his post in a leisurely manner. He seldom reaches the Serai before ll-SO a M., and is often back in his house by 3 p.m. I am informed confidentially that he has already either submitted bis resignation to Constantinople, or has threa tened to do so, unless the Central authorities supply him with £40,000 to carry on the work of the Vilayet. 1 J He kept good order in the town, and robberies have diminished. Since Lis arrival everything has been going on very quietly and smoothly. People, however, are as usual discontented, and affirm he does nothing. The moment is not a favourable one for a forward policy of any kind with the W ar dragging on, and a dearth of funds in the local treasury. The Turkish officials, as I myself witnessed, while paving him a private visit at his house, treat him, while in his presence, with considerable respect, only speak- ing when Le addresses them, and kissing his hands on their arrival and departure. 2. On December 18th, the V T ali, accompanied by the Accountant General, made a tour of inspection to the Hindie Barrage, and to Hilleh. Mr. Wffiitley, Sir John Jackson’s local representative, told me that the Wali expressed himself as very pleased with the works of whose magnitude he had formed no correct idea, until seeing them personally. 3. There have been persistent rumours of the foundation of a Secret Patriotic Society here, consisting of Arabs, with the object of expelling the Turks. The Society is said to include more than one hundred officers of all ranks. The aim of the Society, in addition to turning out the Turks, will be to establish an autonomous form of Government and to encourage patriotism and Pan-Islam- ism. Correspondence is said to be going on between Baghdad and other Arabic districts, and countries under Turkish rule. The local authorities are said to be aware of what is taking place, and are care fully watching events. 4. The V r ali is reported to have received strict orders from Constantinople to maintain good order in the Vilayet, and to banish all agitators and vagabonds. 5. Ferid Bey, Mutassarif of Muntafiq, has on the order of the Wall come to Baghdad to confer with him on the present situation in the Muntafiq country. 6. On the 10th of Muharram, while the service commemorating the death of Husain was taking place at Kazimain, a quarrel arose between some Baghdad and Kazimain Shiahs, resulting in two deaths. On the same day, it was reported that a gendarme, a Jew, who was on duty at the Shrine at Kazimain along with other Moslem gendarmes, was killed while attempting to take up his post at the Mosque. 7 7. Mr. Hony, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal, reports the arrivaa there of a German flour mill made by Mayfarth and Co., Frankfurt a M, and which il intended to be worked by a mule. The machine has been imported from Alleppo and costs, including transport, about £100. Mr. Hony adds 'There is likely to be a big market for such machines, not in Musal itself, where the advantages of oil en gines are beginning to be understood, but in the surrounding villages, where oil en gines would be too expensive and their mechanism not understood. It is worth noting that this is the first machine of any importance not of English make which has been brought here.” C692FD8. Monsieur Saglio, the new French Vice-Consul, has arrived at Musal. 9. Essad Pasha, the Commandant of Musal, is fulfilling the office of Wnli, with signal success and has shewn himself strong and unprejudiced. 10. The Shammar Arabs recently raided the Milli Kurds at Ras-el-Ain. A punitive expedition against the Shammar left Musal, Deir-es-Zor and Diarbekir, simultaneously. 11 Mr. Crow, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basra, reports the arrival, on December 3rd at Basrah from Baghdad, of Brigadier-General Ali Riza Pasha,' Commander of the 13th Army Corps, to act as Wali. Basrah is now in its normal state. ^ Ajeymi bin Sadun Pasha, in reply to the Vilayet’s letter*, stated he had only ( -kt Kioiorio approached Basrah to settle his tribes of •See summary for November 1912, I—12. t&gt; • at ri i ii • . . Beni Malik and others, in their pasture lands and additionally because he had heard from Nassirieh and Khamisieh that orders had been issued by the Vilayet, declaring him to be a robber, and ordering villagers not to supply him and his men with food—an allegation not without foum dation after Ajeymi’s recent looting of his cousin, Mizied Pasha, of £ T. 71,000. The messengers, who returned from Ajeymi’s camp, warned the local autho rities of Basrah to be on their guard against a surprise attack, as long as Ajeymi is in the vicinity. 12. The British Consul at Basrah gives the following, as the distribution of troops in the Basrah Vilayet (as reported to him on November 14th, 1912): Basrah and environs 280 men Nishanji. Kama 150 9J 1st Battalion, 112th Regiment. • • 73 99 Hudoud Bolouki (Frontier Com panies.) Zain • • 83 99 Fao Hudoud Bolouki. Fao • • 11 99 Fort Garrison.

Mr. Crow, under date of December 7th, makes the following additional notes (a) The Hudoud Bolouki (Frontier Post), consisting of 73 men, returned from Kurnah to Basrah. (b) The 1st Battalion, 112th Regiment, consisting of 150 men, proceeded to El Katr peninsula in November. (c) 110 rank-and-file, and 1 Officer (time-expired men) of the Hassa Contin gent arrived at Basrah from Ojeir at the end of November. (d) Brigadier General Ali Riza Pasha, on December 3rd, brought with him from Baghdad :— 165 men of 2nd Battalion, 109th Regiment. 190 men of 3rd Battalion, 111th Regiment. 12 Gunners. ... 2 mountain guns.3 13. Brigadier-General Shukri Pasha has been appointed acting Commander of the 13th Army Corps at Baghdad. Field-Marshal Muhammad Zaki Pasha, the civil Governor-General, also holds the appointment of Inspector of the 4th Military Inspectorate. 14. Essad Pasha, acting Wall of Musal, has received orders to withdraw all troops from the debateable zone on the Turco-Persian frortier. Most of the troops Mr. Hony reports have been withdrawn from Nagirde and Pess,\a to Rawanduz. Those at Bane and Sardesht have not yet been moved, ostensibly'on account of the great outcry of the inhabitants of those places. This, however, may be an artificial excuse got up by the Turks to retain the troops there. Mr. Hony also learns the Turks have withdrawn from Kochannes to Diza. The Russians are said to have occupied Tergawar. 15. Mar Shimmun, the Nestorian Patriarch, has been promised protection^ 1 by the Russian Vice-Consul of Van, who Surnmary tor Oc,ober 1912 &gt; H- 1 - visited him. The matter was reported to Mr. Hony by the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission. Shaikh Sadik of Neri, a big Kurdish Aga, has thrown in his lot with the Russians. The Shaikh of Barzan will, Mr. Hony thinks, be the next to go. II.— British Interests and Cases. The fina ncial difficulty)* in regard to the Mesopotamian irrigation works ^ ^ . XT . imo tt o continues. It has been necessary for me to t*. aummary for November 1912, II-3. report ^ by t( / Hls Maje3 . ty’s Ambassador, and to the Government of India. His Excellency the Ambassador telegraphed me, on December 18th, that the Minister of Finance had instructed the Wali of Baghdad to pay Sir John Jackson, Limited, £23,400 from the local treasury. After at first expressing total inability to do so, unless a remittance w*as made to him from Constantinople, the Accountant-General has paid up, by instalments. £20,000 from the local funds. This liquidates the Turkish Government’s debt to the firm, but leaves no money over to carry on the works. The Accountant-General asserts he cannot pay more money, until next September. I understand the finan cial question will be discussed between the Minister of Finance and Sir John Jack- sons at Constantinople. Meanwhile, the works are half shut down. 2. Owing to the continued low state of the river Tigris,which fell again after „ „ f XT , inio „ „ a temporary rain rise, and also to the oc- J currence of thick fogs at nights and in the early morning, navigation of the river has been impeded, and the mail service has, consequently, again become disorganised. Two consecutive downward mails, leaving here on Tuesday morning, missed the connection at Basrah. 3. Mr. Holdsworth of the firm of Holdsworth, Hougie and Co., of Mancheste r called on me. The firm trade here as Hougie, and Reuben Aboodi. In order to make his posi tion in Baghdad, as a British firm, more clear, Mr. Holdswmrth intends trading here in future as Holdsworth, Hougie and Co., and appointing Mr. Hougie, who is a Baghdad Jew and an Ottoman subject, as the firm’s paid manager. 4. Mr. William Wilson has arrived here from Bushire, to act as Manager of the Baghdad branch of Strick, Scott and Co., and the Arglo-Persian Oil Company. He will replace Mr. R. O. Harvey, who leaves for Europe shortly. III.— British Indian Interests and Cases. 1.

These articles were practi cally repetitions^ of former ones, which had appeared in the late Wali Jemal Bey’s time, and possibly at his inspiration. I am informed from a good source that the present Wali warned the editor to cease publishing articles, which might offend British susceptibilities. In any case the attacks suddenly ceased appearing in the newspaper, with e savmg clause to be continued” at the end of the last published article. V.— Persian Affairs. 1. Mr. E. B.

The object of this league is to revenge the evils they have suffered at the hands of the Kalhur tribe, who were the principal supporters of Salar-ed-Dowleh. As soon as Ali Akbar Khan, son of Samsam-el-Mamalik, arrives to take com mand, it is probable the league will attack the Kalhur. 4. The roads beyond Kirmanshah are very unsafe, robberies frequently taking ] place, and exactions of the so-called road guards being unusually heavy. The road from Kasr-i-Shirin to Kirmanshah is also in a lawless state. The cost of the common articles of food, such as flour and eggs, have arisen very much at Kirmanshah. 5. The Governor hirman Firma has only 250 soldiers, armed with Werundel and 250 levies, and 100 mujahids with repeating rifles. The 150 Persian Cossacks, with 1 maxim, were recalled to Tehran. The tribes, on the other hand, are said to have thousands of modem rifles. VI. —Other Foreign Interests. 1.

There have been persistent rumours here that the English are going to buy out the Gormans from the Basrah-Baghdad and Baghdad-Musal sections of the Baghdad Railway.

Towards the end of October Lutfi Bey, the Acting Wali, made a short tour in the Vilayet. He returned on November 5th. He was accompanied by the Accountant-General and the Director of the Agricultural Department. He first inspected the Hindie Barrage works and expressed himself as very pleased with the progress they had made. Subsequently, he visited Karbala and Najaf and endea voured to pursuade the rich people there to subscribe to the war fund. About £ T. 450 were collected. From Najaf he went on to Shamiveh to try and effect a reconci liation between two Shaikhs of the tribes in the vicinity, who have quarrelled over the question of the ownership of certain landed property. In this endeavour, however, the Acting Wali failed. 2. A telegram from the Minister of Interior at Constantinople ordered the election of Deputies at Baghdad for the Turkish Parliament to be postponed for the present. 3. A telegraphic order was received fro n Constantinople that all Turkish Gov ernment officials drawing more than £ T. 3 per month must pay a war tax of 10% of their salaries. 4. I hear from a Turkish member of the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce, that a certain Qarasu Effendi, an ex-Deputy for Salonika, has obtained a conces sion for navigation on the Euphrates. No more definite information is avail able at present. 5. While the local artillery were drilling on November 11th, a cannon was fired off, the noise of which was heard all over the city. Great excitement and jubila tion prevailed for a short while, the inhabitants thinking the cannon had been fired to announce the fall of Sofia. 6. On November 12th, Muhammad Zaki Pasha, the new Wali of Baghdad, ar rived. According to the usual British prac- 8ee Summary for October 1912 — 1 , 13. ]) ra goman of this Consulate-General called on him and offered him my congratulations on his appointment and safe ar rival. The Wali received him with great politeness and courtes^y. 7. On November 16th, the Wali received the official visit of all the Consuls at the Serai, in full dress uniform. Accompanied by Lieutenant Campbell of the B. I. M. S. “ Comet/’ Mr. Nersessian, the .Dragoman, and Mr. Gaskin, the Assistant for Trade and Com merce, I called on the Wali. He received our visit most courteously. As he speaks neither French, nor Arabic, conversation had to be carried on by means of the Dragoman. The new Wali, who is said to be over sixty, is a fine looking man with a good presence and impresses one as capable of wielding authority. On November 18th the Wali returned my call, in full dress uniform. *See Summary for August 1911—II, 2. ex-Wali Jemal Bey. 8. The Wali’s firman* was read on Novem ber 16th. It is quite similar to that of the After the firman was read, the Wali made a short speech in which he said *‘Foreigners are our guests in Turkey; we must always treat them with great courtesy and protect them.” 9. The war continues to create little interest, and no excitement here, although the “ Zuhur ” newspaper, the organ of the Committee of Union and Progress, and whose editor is about 18 years old, publishes inflammatory pan-Islamic articles inviting all Moslems to unite in exterminating the Christians. I learn my French colleague, Mons. Wiet, interviewed the Wali in regard to the above articles. I2 3 r •j r , Th * exhortations, however, fall on deaf ears here, chiefly no doubt because the Arabs are disgusted with Turkish rule, and would be glad to change it, and also Jj ause * h , e . Wa J‘ S11 | ce 1118 arrival has taken every step in his power to maintain del and discipline by means of the police at his disposal. Ihe Christians and Jewish quarters of the city are -well patrolled at night. aj ° f 7 a g abollds » on November 15th, collected at the Mosque of Shaikh Ddul t^adir and clamoured to be allowed to massacre the Jews and Christians, baiyid Abdur Rahman Effendi, the Naqib, warned them in strong language to desist from the attempt, and they dispersed. tvt ^ ^\^ 1 ’ however ’ on Ws arrival, sent for the Naqib and his son, Saiyid a nmd Effendi, and solemnly assured them if anti-Christian massacres occurred m the Shaikh quarter he would have them shot. Several Moslems, who were overheard to make boasting statements in the Bazar of their desire to massacre Christians, were imprisoned at once. Public prayers are offered in the Christian Churches and Jewish Synagogues here, for the victory of the Turkish Arms, no doubt as a diplomatic measure. 10. The Bairam was celebrated here on November 20th. The Dragoman of the Consulate-General, as usual, took my calling card to the Wali and some of the other high officials and offered them my congratulations. Judging from the crowds in the streets and the number of guns fired off during the four days’ holiday, the people seemed to be enjoying themselves much as usual. 11. Mr. Hony reports from Musal that orders have been received there from Constantinople that all troops are to be withdrawn from the Frontier Posts of Pesswa, Nagirde, Bane and Serdesht. Mr. Hony says that the anti-Christian agitation in Musal is very artificial and only kept alive by the “ Ulema”. Volunteers for the War have also been discouraged and informed that their services can only be accepted if they provide themselves with warm clothing and are’ capable of standing a cold climate. An impassioned telegraphic appeal (annexure A.) signed by Saiyid Ismail Sadar-ud-din, Muhammad Baqir Tabatabayi and Shaikh Husain-el-Hairi, was des patched by some Mujtahids of Karbala to the Sultan. The telegram was also pub lished in the “ Zuhur ” newspaper of November 20th. The Grand Vizier thanked the Mujtahids, through the Mutasarrif of Karbala, but replied that as the site of the War was so distant volunteers were not required. The really Turkish element of the population are naturally depressed and are incensed, as the true state of affairs becomes known, at the unending series of Turkish victories published in the Agency telegrams here. 12. On November 25th, rumours were current here that Basra was being attacked by some 2,000 Arabs under the leadership of Ajeymi, son of Sadun Pasha. It was also said that the Shaikhs of the Bani Lam were marching on Basra. The Wali and Ali Riza Pasha, Commandant of the 13th Army Corps, remained till midnight at the Telegraph Office in conversation with Constantinople. The result became known next day, when it was learnt that Ali Riza Pasha had been nominated Wali for Basra. He left on the Turkish Steamer “ Mosul ” with two battalions (about 400 men in all) Nizam soldiers on November 27th to take up his new appointment. Two field guns were embarked at Garrara. Mr. Crow informs me that a small scare actually did occur at Basra on Novem ber 25th and 26th, He describes what happened as follows :— “ The bazars and the offices of the Bank were closed. Many Christian fami lies fled from Basra town to the suburb of Achar and some of them A) SBsought refuge at the American and Russian Consulates to the road. Christian clerks in business establishments brought their families to the firms’ offices and a panic prevailed. “ Saiyid Talib Bey, the Deputy and the Acting Wali, at once adopted offensive measures to protect the town. Soldiers and marines and two mountain guns were moved out to the desert at the back of the town and a number of armed Arabs were collected from the districts south of Basra and moved on to the desert with the troops. 4 ‘ The arrival of the armed Arabs from the villages did not conduce to allay the panic as the men came in shouting their Hosa or war cry and firing off their rifles in every direction. There w r ere, however, no casualties. The Vilayet have sent a letter to Ajeymi’s camp, which has been located at Chabda, about 12 hours from Basra. No reply has yet been received. Ajeymi may, Mr. Crow thinks, for reasons connected with his father’s death and captivity, have meditated a coup on Basra in view of the weakness of the garrison, which it is computed only numbered 300 armed men including Nizam troops, marines, and gendarmerie. As nothing occurred up to November 29th, the troops were withdrawn from the desert and the armed villagers dispersed. With the arrival of Ali Riza Pasha, the affair will probably terminate. .. H. M. S. “ Sphinx ’ ’ arrived at Basra on the 27th November. 13. Shaikh Abdulla* Mazindarani, the well-known Mujtahid, died at Najaf * See Summary for March and April 1912 — on No\ ember 24th. Ill, 4 (paragiaph 3). The Persian Consul-General received telegraphic orders from his Government to at once proceed to Najaf and offer the condolences of the Persian Nation to the family of the deceased Mujtahid. He has already left for Najaf. II. —British Interests and Cases. 1. Mr. Collett relieved Mr. Extross as Postmaster in charge of the British Post Office at Baghdad. Mr. David arrived from Basra and has replaced Mr. Collett as clerk. Mr. Extross has applied for a year’s furlough prior to retirement. 2. A telegraphic correspondence with the Embassy and the Government of India was again unfortunately rendered necessary in regard to the amount of ammunition that the new Residency! ■\See Summary for December 1911 -VI, 1. should bring with them&gt; It was finally decided that the sepoys should bring only 32 rounds pouch ammunition. All friction with the local authorities was thereby avoided and the Customs raised no objection. The Wali wrote me a polite letter asking the number and composition of the new guard to which I at once replied giving him the details. The new guard arrived on the 15th November and the relieved guard left on 19th November without incident. 3. On November 16th, the Government of India consulted me by telegram on the exact state of the finances of the Mesopotamian irrigation works. After consultation with Mr. Arthur Whitley, Sir John Jackson’s representative in Mesopotamia, I replied that for some time past Sir John Jacksons have been themselves financing the undertaking and that the Ottoman Gov eminent owe the firm in round number T. £. 16,000. The National Bank of Turkey, so far as Mr. Whitley is aware, have provided no money at all, although Sir John Jackson’s exact financial arrangements are unknown to him. Mr. Whitley had been counting on the fact, which was telegraphed to him from Constantinople, that the Minister of Public Works had on October 23rd requested the Minister of Finance to telegraph a credit of £. T. 50,000 to Baghdad for the Mesopotamian irrigation works. So far no instructions have reached Baghdad.4 | &gt; The new Wali has repeatedly telegraphed to Constantinople urging the autho rities there to send orders, but no reply has been received. Under the conditions at present existing in the Capital, this is hardly sur prising. On November 23rd I informed His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador by tele gram in regard to Sir John Jackson’s affairs as Mr. Whitley had then received instruction from London to close down all the works shortly if the Turkish Government shewed no disposition to liquidate their debt to the firm. Mr. Whitley, who is closely in touch with the Serai, tells me the new Wali is not up in the civil side of his administration and that the Assistant Wali, Lutfi Bey, and the heads of the Departments mostly carry on the current duties of the post. The new Wali, however, shows every disposition to help Mr. Whitley. 4. I was able to inform Mr. Cree (of Blockey Cree and Company) who, for some f inlo , TTTT . time past, has been desirous of erecting a •See Summary for May 1912—VIII, 4. • A , * x - i ji , t i i private store* tor petroleum, that 1 had heard privately from the Embassy that a decree had been given against the Salo nika Municipality, by the Council of State, on their claim to possess a monopoly for the storage of Petroleum oil. Mi. Cree was very grateful for the information. 5. On November 18th Mr. William Wier of the shipping firm of Andrew Wier and Company, London, called on me accompanied by Abdul Kadir Pasha, his local representative. Mr. Wier expressed the opinion that the trade of the Persian Gulf was but in its infancy. 6. Sub-Assistant Surgeon N. P. Bawa, who is serving with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Ahwaz, submitted a petition to me volunteering for service with the Red 'Crescent Society, in the present war. In returning it to him, I asked him to address the British Consul in whose jurisdiction he is residing. 7. Mr. R. Marrs of the University of Bombay arrived at Baghdad towards the end of October. He has visited Samarra, Karbala, Babyldn and the Hindie Barrage. He is studying Arabic. 8. Mr. W. Souter, Inspector-General of Police for Scinde, paid a short visit to Baghdad. He also went to Karbala, Babylon and the Hindie Barrage. 9. The Government of India called for a joint report by the Consul at Basra and the Resident at Baghdad on the question of the delays to which His Majesty’s Mails are subjected to at Basra by the Euphrates and Tigiris Steam Navigation Company, Limited, on the upward trip to Baghdad. I submitted to the Government of India Mr. F. E. Crow’s report and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s explanation with my obser vations, last month. The question of the second barge-j- impeding the navigation of the steamers , .. , j . i iqto has already been dealt with by Mr. Lori- t-Se« Summary for March and April 1912— J J V, 3. mer - III. —British Indian Interests and Cases. 1 Shaikh Muhammad Ispahani of the Indian Educational Department, Bombay, called on me.

The papers relating to the Bahou Begum Trust fund were sent last month eKp Government of India for their orders. \ Ai5 5.

I forwarded last month their peti- 1. Khan Bahadur Muhammad Hasan Muhsin, British Vice-Consul at Karbala, reports to me that the recent distribution under the Oudh Bequest passed off most successfully both at Karbala and Najaf. distribution. Mr. Muhammad Hasan briefly sums up the feature of the Karbala distribution as follows :— In regard to Najaf, he writes :— “ I was very much struck with the friendly attitude of the Qaimakam and the censures which he passed upon His Excellency Jamal Bey (the late Wali of Baghdad) for his administrative mistakes, among which he counted the disappointing of the Turkish paupers. at Najaf, the Vice-Consul writes :— “ On this occasion all had changed, our critics and even some of our enemies had become friends, and, besides the common students, scores of higher class Mullas and some Mujtahids came before the Committee and received assistance at the rates which common paupers were receiving. “ The Committee on their part did their best to please the visitors in order to encourage other people and make the system more popular than before. The result was, therefore, a distribution of which the mem bers are really proud, and, in proof of this, it is enough to say that a manlike Muhammad Kazim Yezdi was among the thousands of those who eulogised the distribution in Najaf and Karbala.” Shaikh Fazl-Ullah, son of Hijjat-ul-Islam, Shaikh Hadi, Mujtahid of Karbala, and also Saiyid Muhammad Ja’afer Shirazi, Mujtahid of Najaf, have both written congratulatory letters to the Resident and at the same tune asking to share under the new scheme. The Honorary Secretary of the All-India Shia Conference has also sent a con gratulatory letter to the British Consul-General in which this passage occurs :— “ It cannot be denied that our British Government has a great regard for its Indian subjects and is ever anxious to adopt all those possible means which add to their comfort and ease. So I, the Honorary Secretary of the All-India Shia Conference, beg to express my heartfelt thanks to you and the British Government on behalf of the entire Indian Shia community.” taneously, both the Embassy and the Viceroy, to be registered as British subjects in ’Iraq. tion to the Embassy and the Government of India, with my remarks. IV.— British Official Matters. In accordance with Mr. Lorimer’s agreement with the Vilayet great care was taken at both places to exclude* all Otto man subjects from participating in the “ I thank the Almighty that the whole affair passed very pleasantly much more so than the previous distribution and we met with no hitch whatever in the course of business. It is enough to say that when the distribution was ended friends and enemies were equally pleased and the Acting Mutasarrif thanked me in person.” “ At subsequent meetings he suggested to me to disregard the prohibition and to extend the charity to any deserving Arabs, whom I knew, if not openly then under false names. I naturally refused the sug gestion.” Referring to the difference between the last distribution and the present one t ifThe newly-appointed Indian Mujtahid, Maulvi Saiyid Ahmad, paid me a visit on November 13th. He proceeded at once to Najaf to take up his appointment. 2. The new Wali has just answered my letter, which I addressed to the Acting Wali in September in regard to the case of the firing on Mr. E. B. Soane, His Bri tannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul. Kasrishirin, to the effect that (1) The Procureur-Gene- ral has dismissed the case, against the private soldier of having robbed Mr Soane s servant of 3 handkerchiefs, for lack of proof; (2) the Commander of the 13th (Baghdad) Army Corps has cautioned the Officer Commanding the frontier post and warned him not to repeat the offence ; (3) the Officer and the private soldier have both been transferred elsewhere ; ( 4 ) the papers of the case have been sent to the Minister of War at Constantinople with the remarks of the Commandant of the 13th Baghdad Army Corps. It will thus he seen that the culprits have escaped practically without punish- ment. In regard to the statement that no proofs were available against the private soldier, the Dragoman actually took Mr. Soane’s servant to the Serai to interview Qudrat Bey, the Director of Political Affairs, and I also recorded a sworn statement nf the servant. Qudrat Bey returned an evasive answer that he was unaware how the proper judicial formalities should begin. 3. On his return from Baghdad to Chia Surkh on November 9th, Mr. Soane was robbed bjj three Arabs armed with rifles and daggers in Turkish territory, near Khan-i-Chul. They stole £ 12-10-0 Stg. and various other articles. The Wali has not so far answered my letter asking for punishment of the offen ders and restitution of the money to Mr. Soane through this Consulate-General. A more extensive robbery on a Russian subject on the same road has been treated by the Vilayet in the same manner. My Russian Colleague’s letter also, not having been replied to. I am informing His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador by telegram in regard to Mr. Soane’s cases. V.—Persian Affairs. 1 There is no news here of the Salar-ed-Dowleh. He is supposed to be hiding in Mazandaran. Firman Firma remains at Kirmanshah. He has appointed Abbas Khan, grandson of the late Daoud Khan to be Governor of Kalhur. The roads remain very unsafe, and 1,500 pilgrims for Karbala are said to be detained at Kirmanshah on that account. 2. Mr. E. B. Soane, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Kasrishirin on November 8th and 9th, held a conference at Baghdad with Mons. Orlow, the Russian Consul-General, in regard to the proposed new frontier line, between Turkey and Persia, to be adopted in the Zohab District. Briefly stated the conclusions arrived at were to accept the mediating Com missioners’ line till the Kuretu river is reached. From there it is proposed to utilise the Kuretu river as far as the village of Kuretu. From that point an obhque line is to be adopted, which will join the present locally accepted frontier, which is delimitated by guard houses until it joins the Elvend river at Kani Biz. From Kani Biz to Mendali an indefinite and so far undetermined line (for want of adequate geographical information) has been recommended, which will leave the present winter lands of the powerful Sinjabi tribe still in Pemia. ^ It may be remarked that there is no present locally accepted frontier from Kani Biz to Mendali. As a compensation to Turkey a cession in the North-East of the territory of Shemiran inhabited by a sedentary Sunni and Turcophil population has been pro posed. Again, for lack of information, the exact delimitation of the proposed ces sion could not be determined.Under instructions from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, Mr. Soane is busy preparing a sketch map, which will embody all his own and Mens. Orlow’s recommendations. VI.— Other Foreign Affairs. 1 On November 4th, the flag of the Residency was kept at half-mast on receipt of the news of the death of Mr. Vice President Sherman of United States of America. 2. The Russian Vice-Consul for Musal (who resides practically all the year at Baghdad) made a short tour in the Musal Vilayet. He visited Kirkuk, Suleimanie, Bane, Serdesht, Koni Sanjak and Erbil. Mr. Hony, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal, writes : “ I hear he been verv active in making military investigations and has also shown con- shLerahle interest in trade conditions.” 3. Dr. Herzfeldt, the German archaeologist, has returned from Germany to Samarra. He has been accompanied by a Captain Ludolf, who, it is said, belongs to the Prussian General Staff. It is asserted by my Russian Colleague that his real mis sion here is to act as a military specialist to the local Turkish authorities in case of real or fancied emergencies. yj£.—M iscellaneous and General. 1 Meissner Pasha, on the arrival of the new Wali, at once placed the Baghdad Railway Motor Launch at his disposal. He uses it daily m going from the Serai to his house and vice-versa. NORMAN SCOTT, Caytain, Acting Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majestey’s Consul-General, Baghdad.

I.—Internal Affairs. i~\ 1. On October 2nd, there was a report current that, the Commander of the XIII (Baghdad) Arm} 7 Corps had received secret instructions from Constantinople to hold himself in readiness to mobilize the reserves at once on receipt of further orders. 2. The Sultan’s birthday was celebrated very quietly at Baghdad on October 3rd. The Acting Wali informed all the Consuls in writing that the reception at the Serai would be held in ordinary Summer dress. Accompanied by Lieutenant Campbell of the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” and Mr. Nersessian, the Residency Dragoman, I paid the customary congratulatory visit. The R. I. M. S. “ Comet, ” and the Residency flagstaff were dressed for the occasion. At night practically no buildings were illuminated except the house of Meissner Pasha. 3. On October 6th, the Acting Wali invited some 50 people to be present at o the Serai. No War had then been declared Summary for October 1911, II, 9. but he made a ^ , rt of is as follows :— The present War between Turkey and the Balkan Powers is one of religion. It is our duty to show our patriotic zeal in a practical manner. Ottomans who are near the Capital are volunteering for service. We are too far away for that but not too far to send money. I expect every Ottoman present to subscribe now as much ns he possibly can. ” Muhammad Pasha Daghistani thereupon gave £ T. 100 and added that, at a future date if necessity arose, he would sell all his property and give the proceeds to the Government, The Naqib also gave £ T. 100. Altogether £ T. 1,045 were subscribed and a telegram intimating the fact was sent to Constantinople. The Notables, who were present at the meeting next day, in their turn, sent for rich Jewish and Christian merchants and proceeded to squeeze money out of them for the War funds. Similar meetings were held on October 12th at Kazimain and Mu’azzam. There was a fair attendance of people. The War was described as one of “ Cross and Crescent. ’ W hether any money was collected is not known. 4. At the Serai on October 8th, in the presence of the Military Officers and high Civil Officials, all of whom were in full dress uniform, a telegraphic edict was read from the Sultan. The edict ordered all the soldiers of the Active Army, the Reserves and the Mustahfizes of the entire Circles of the list and 2nd Inspectorships to be called out and mobilized. Some of the soldiers of the 3rd Mustahfiz were also ordered to be mobilized. 5. Montenegro declared War on Turkey on October 8th, and rumours that the other Balkan Powers would join were current. 6, On October 17th, news that peace had been signed between Turkey and Italy was received. 7. On October 18th, it was learned that hostilities had also broken out between Turkey and Bulgaria and Servia. Later, it was announced that Greece had declared War on Turkey.. C557FD8. His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople informed me, by See Summary for October 1911 , U,] 9. telegram, of the issue of His Britannic (British Neutrality). Majesty’s Proclamation of neutrality, on October 21st, in the above Wars, and a telegram to the same effect was received from the Government of India. I at once advised the Acting Wali by official letter and intimated to him that I should likewise inform all British subjects under my jurisdiction. This was duly done, and a copy of ths former Proclamation of neutrality in the Turco-Italian War was circulated pro-tempore for the information of British subjects. Printed notices were distributed among the people of Baghdad relative to the new War. Their purport is as follows : — “ Hasten to help your Moslem brethren, who are suffering on account of this War. Give your money freely to help Islam.” So far no one here appears to take any interest in the War beyond the Foreign Consuls. All the German Officials are markedly Turco-phil in their opinions. The Ottoman Agency telegrams describe daily victories for the Turks. 9. Murad Bey and Jamil Effendi, two of the Deputies for Baghdad, have arrived here. They are Union and Progress Committee nominees and have receiv ed instructions to organise a demonstration against the present Cabinet. 10. Agents of Ibn Rashid Ibn Sa’oud, and some of the smaller Shaikhs of the Dilaym, had an interview with the Commander of the XIII (Baghdad) Army Corps. 11. On October 16th, the Minister of War sent a telegram to Baghdad inti mating that the Army’s movements must be kept secret. Local newspapers, and especially foreigners, are to be kept in strict ignorance of military news. Anyone disobeying the order is to be punished as a traitor to his country. 12. Qudrat Bey,* the “ Directeur des Affaires Politiques” here, who it was * See Summary for September 1911 , II, understood had been lecalled to Constanti- 7 . nople, has received a telegram confirming him in his appointment. 13. The new Wali, Zeki Pasha, left Deir-ez-zor on November 2nd and should reach here within 10 days. 14. Mr. Crow, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, reported that a certain Essayimi, a member of the Committee of Union and Progress, sent a telegram to the Minister of the Interior, and to several newspapers at Cons tantinople, intimating that Ajeymi, son of the late Sadun Pasha, was ready to march on Constantinople with 50,000 men in the event of any reactionary attempt being made on the Constitution. This was.only a bit of bluff on the part of the Committee. The Mutassarif of Nasriyeh, some weeks ago, asked Ajeymi to join him in an expedition against the A1 Aboodah tribes, who were near Shattra on the Eu phrates. This, Ajeymi refused to do. The Government troops, on attacking the A1 Aboodah Arabs, were defeated losing 20 men. As the Arabs have at present great difficulty in obtaining ammunition, Mr. Crow thinks there is little likelihood of there being any war-like movement among the Muntafiq tribes just now. The garrison at Basrah has been reduced to about 80 men and 159 marines, owing to the units of the 1st Battalion of the 112th regiment having been concen trated at Ojeir instead of being divided up at Umm Kasr, Zobair, Sefwan and Fao.Later in tlie month Mr. Crow reported that Ajeymi, son of the late Sadun Pasha, had overpowered his cousin Mizied Pasha at Gabeshiah, in the marshes, south of the Euphrates and about a day's journey from Basrah. Ajeymi is alleged to have carried off cash to the value of £.T. 71,000. Another cousin of Ajeymi’s, Abdullah Bey, threatens to attack him with 5,000 men to punish him and also, if possible, to recover the money. 15. Mr. Crow informs me that the following Deputies have been elected for the Sanjaq of Basrah :— 1. Saiyid Talib Bey, son of the Naqib. 2. Saiyid Zaid, his cousin. 3. Haji Issa Rahi, the Naqib’s clerk. 4. Ahmad Naim Bey, a former President of the Criminal Court and now a staunch supporter of the Liberal Party, although formerly elected deputy as a Union and Progress candidate. 5. Abdul Razack el Naaza, a friend of the Naqib’s family. Five deputies have been elected as compared with four at the last election. The absence of any official census of the population renders this elasticity of representation possible. Mr. Crow adds “ the attractions of a visit to the Capital at the public expense are, moreover, great for the notables of Basrah, irrespective of party sentiment, and the arrangements in this case seem to have been much in the hands of the candidates themselves.” Saiyid Talib Bey is said to be, to-day, the most influential man in the Basrah Vilayet. Under his influence “ a family party ” has been returned to Parliament. No intimidation was, however, used. The Government abstained from all interference, and this unanimous selection of “ Ittilafjis ” represents the free choice of a united suffrage. The Acting Wali of Basrah summoned the Mutassarif of Nasriyeh to appear before him to answer charges of interfering in the previous elections. He refused to do so, and, as the Local Authorities have no means to compel him, he is being left alone. On similar grounds Serri Bey, a member of the Committee of Lnion and Progress and Mutassarif of ’Amara has been suspended. At Baghdad, the elections have been stopped by telegram from Constantinople. 16. Mr. Hony reports from Musal that Tahir Pasha, the former Wali, has been suspended. During September alone, 167 people were criminally killed or wounded in the Caza of Musal. The Hamawand Kurds are in rebellion again and have held up two or three caravans coming from Baghdad to Suleimanieh. The actual garrison at Musal has been much reduced. Fourteen hundred Tevellud have been discharged. On October 1st, the actual numbers were:— 35th Cavalry Regiment 103rd Artillery .. Nishanji Battalion Transport Corps .. 104, 105 Nizam, 6 Batteries .. 250 .. 250 .. 280 .. 2oo .. 281 Total # 9 .. 1,261 The 103rd Nizam has been transferred to Rawanduz vice 104th transferred to Musal.On October 17th, forty loads of artillery and one hundred loads of small-arm ammunition were sent to Rawanduz. The 105th Regiment sustained a defeat in an expedition against the Goyan Kurds, losing 8 killed and 15 wounded. 17. Mr. de Kirico of the Tobacco Regie, who has just returned from an ins pection tour of the Persian Frontier, informs me smuggling is rife everywhere. The frontier garrisons have been strengthened, and the Turks are building block houses in Persian territory towards Bedra and Suleimanieh, and drive off Persian cultivators who try to till their land. II. —British Interests and Cases. 1. The Reverend W. A. Wigram, D. D., of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission, from Amadia arrived at Baghdad on October 8th, on his way home via India and Constantinople. He stayed with me at the Residency till he left on October 17th. He also paid a short visit to Babylon. It would appear that Mar Shimun, the Nestorian Patriarch and his Bishops desire the English to take more political interest in them and their Church. In fact they wish for an official pro tection such as the Chaldeans enjoy from the French. The Russians are appa rently anxious to offer them this facility, and a Section of the Nestorians have been parleying with them. Mr. Hony writes : “ They ask (the English) that either official protection be granted them or sufficient money be given to their Bishops to enable them to become their own officials,” meaning thereby sufficient money to bribe the real officials to carry out their washes (a naive request which might open the eyes of anyone who still believed in the progress made by the new regime); if neither of these are granted to them they hoped the Mission (Archbishop of Canter bury’s) would not be angry with them if they turned to the Russians”. Dr. Wigram hopes, with the help of His Majesty’s Ambassador, to be able to interest the Minister of the Interior at Constantinople in the Nestorian’s behalf. It is more than probable that their complaints in regard to their sufferings have never gone further than the local Qaimaqam. 2. Mr. Arthur Whitley, Sir John Jackson, Limited, representative in Mesopo tamia, finds himself in a difficult position. The Turkish Government are no longer supplying money for the Hindieh and Rumadie works and I understand Sir John Jackson, Limited, have now advanced from their own pocket considerable sums. Mr. Whitley is awaiting the arrival of Zeki Pasha, the new Wali, with interest and impatience. III. —British Indian Interests and Cases. 1. The judgment Af the Karbala Court in the case* of Saiyid Muhammad Husain {alias Saiyid Baraj) has been quashed * See Summary for August 1912 , v, i. by the Court of Cj/ssation at Constantinople. Under His Excellency’s order, the Vice-Consul at Karbala is instructed to personally attend the hearings of the new trial. 2. Haji Abdul Karim, who since May last has been endeavouring to obtain permission to erect an ice and flour machine at Hillah, has finally, on October 19th, obtained permission from the Vilayet. Every difficulty and obstruction was placed in his way by the local autho rities. 3. The case-j* of Saiyid Muhammad, son of Azim Shah,' has advanced a step f See Summary for September 1912, HI, 1. further. The Appeal Court has acquitted the policeman Mustafa Effendi and the gen darme of illegally detaining Saiyid Muhammad at the police station. The Court, however, convicted the accused of having beaten Saiyid Muhammad.Under a new law, however, a personal petition is required to be presented to the Court by the complainant. Most opportunely Saiyid Muhammad, son of Azim Shah, just returned from India and, under my instructions, he submitted his petition. The Court will now fix a date for another hearing. If Saiyid Muhammad had not been to hand, the accused would have escaped punishment. 4. Khan Sahib Saiyid Ahmad ’Ali Khan of, the Indian Provincial Civil Service, paid me a visit on October 22nd. He is visiting the holy shrines. 5. Khan Sahib Abdul ’Ali, son of Adamjee, the British Indian merchant at Baghdad, returned here from Karachi on October 29th. IV.— British Official Matters. 1. The case* of the firing on Mr. E. B. Soane, British Vice-Consul at Kasr- shrin, remains in status quo ante. * See Summary for September 1912, IV, 1. ^ The Vilayet have returned me no written reply to my reminders. So far as I know the offenders have not been adequately^punished. I note from a Foreign Office “Blue Print” that, in view of the questions likely to arise relative to Zohab in the Turco-Persian frontier dispute, Sir Edward Grey deems it inadvisable that this question should be opened with the Porte at the present moment. V.— Persian Affairs. 1. The conference between Mons. Orlow, the Russian Consul-General and Mr. E. B. Soane, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Kasr-shirin in regard to the Turcot-Persian frontier has not yet Summary for September 1912, V, 2. taken p]ace Mons. Orlow is awaiting instructions from his Embassy. 2. On October 4th, Yar Muhammad Kh an attacked Kirmanshah with 200 mujahids and 700 juanrudis. They had taken the greater part of the town, when Yar Muhammad fell shot dead. His followers lost heart and, in a short time, were routed. In crossing the open spaces, their casualities were heavy as the maxim guns were turned on them. Two hundred of Yar Muhammad’s followers took refuge in the British Con sulate. Firman Firm a granted them an amnesty and sent them to their country under escort. Caravans are proceeding to Hamadan under escort. Telegraphic communication was restored between Kirmanshah and Tehran after months of interruption. The death of Yar Muhammad Khan is expected to put an end to Salar-ed- Dowleh’s rebellion. He is reported to be at Kurveh, half way between Hamadan and Senneh. Other rumours say he is marching on Tehran. A letter from Mr. McDouall, of October 26th, reports that things are in an unsatisfactory state at Kirmanshah. The Army has left for Hamadan to meet their reliefs, who are under the com mand of Sardar Ashja,’ Bahktiari. “ Firman Firma’ Mr. McDouall says, “ sacrifices everything for his own gain”, VI.—Other Foreign Interest. 1. Mons. Orlow, the Russian Consul-General, has had a quarrel with the Acting Wali, Lutfi Bey, and the Directeur des Affaires Politiques, Qudret Bey, over some question relating to Mons. Orlow’s dragoman.6 The Russian Consul-General claims that they insulted him at the Serai.' It is understood Mons. Orlow asked his Ambassador to have Lutfi Bey and Qudrat ■ Bey recalled or to be himself transferred to another,post. . v . , : • On the occasion of the Sultan’s birthday, Mons. Orlow sent his Vice-Consul to represent him, audit was noticeable that the Acting Wali accorded him a very cold reception. [VII. —General and Miscellaneous. 1. Saiyid Yusuf-ez-Zuwawi, a prominent merchant and notable of Muscat, visited Baghdad. He called on me on October 14th. I was pleased to welcome him as an old personal friend and also as a friend and supporter of the English at Muscat. He brought me messages from His Highness Saiyid Feysil bin Turki, the Sultan of Muscat, and from his family. Saiyid Yusuf is revisiting the Holy Shrines at^Samarra, Najaf and Karbala. He is keenly interested in the irrigation proposals in Mesopotamia, and is making a special visit to the Hindieh Barrage. I gave him a letter of introduction to the Chief Engineer. 2. The cold season has at last begun. The heat this year has been very protracted. ^ 3. The Tigris is rising slowly, and, as a result, the navigation and postal service have greatly improved.

I.—Internal Affairs. 1. A severe fight is reported to have taken place towards the end of August at El Ahsa between Ibn Us-Su’ud Abdul Aziz Pasha and the tribe of ’Ajman resulting in the defeat of the latter. 2. Abdul Muhsin Pasha-ez-Zuhair of Basrah, the President of the Club of the Committee of Union and Progress has sent in his resignation and joined the opposi tion Club of Liberal Accord. 3. Robberies in Turkish territory are reported near Khanaqin and Bajlan. The Turkish Zangenah were reported to have rebelled and 20 of them entered the Bajlan district of Persia with rifles captured from Turkish soldiers. In con junction with the Bajlan they raided in Turkish territory. A hundred Turkish cavalry are said to have pursued the raiders into Persian territory, killing three and taking some prisoners. On September 21st, 70 men belonging to the Zangenah tribe in Persia attack ed the Nade tribe at Mandali, killing the Shaikh and robbing 5,000 sheep and 3 mares. 4. The Turkish authorities are reported to be increasing their frontier guards in consequence and to be building forts at Khura Khura and Tila Kuh. See Summary for March and April 1912 , The Wilayat has nominated TTnmaydi, I, 3 . the youngest son of Farhan Pasha, to be Shaikh of the Shammar tribe. On September 26th, Humaydi arrived at Baghdad with about 300 men. He pitched his tents on the west side of the Tigris near the Kher river. It is reported he will leave for Hillah on October 1st. 6. The Mutasarrif of the Muntafik imprisoned a man named Abu Wahayib of the Husaynat tribe for an alleged robbery. The Shaikh of the tribe sent a special messenger to the Mutasarrif demanding his release. He received no answer to his demand. Accordingly his tribe (A1 Husnayat) with the assistance of the A1 Budur, A1 Ghazi and A1 Asakiah have been robbing and plundering the Sanjaq and the Government officials are quite powerless to stop them. 7. Mr. Hony, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal, describes the state of Kurdistan as appalling. He writes as follow’s “ There are no Resident Consuls and very few travellers and so the world remains in ignorance ; but I feel sure that if it were possible to collect details of all the crimes committed there, they would be found to equal both in quality and quantity those enumerated in the monthly crimes report of Macedonia compiled by His Majesty’s Consul- General at Salonica. ” Every Kurdish Agha owns Christian villages and, in addition to extorting money and corvee from them, when the Aghas quarrel among each other—which is a frequent occurrence—their first step is to wreak vengeance on the Christian villages belonging to their opponents. The Bairam passed off quietly. The Sunnis celebrated it on September 12th and the Shi’ahs on September 13th. See Summary for September 1911, I, 5. C509FD There was no suggestion made this year of Foreign Consuls attending the official reception at the Serai.2 9. Nothing official is known here regarding the whereabouts or the date of arrival of the newly-appointed Wali, Zaki Pasha. It appears from private informa tion he has not even yet left Constantinople. Under the regime of the acting Wali, Luffi Bey, every thing remains quiet at 1 present. II.—British Interests and Cases. 1. Mr. H. C. Hony, the British Vice-Consul at Musal, has had an unpleasant ex perience. While making a tour in his Wilayat he encamped one night outside a village, called Har, in the valley at the foot of Mat Yaile (Nestorian mountains). During the night the villagers robbed him of saddle bags containing goods worth about £ Stg. 5. In the morning he summoned the villagers together and asked them to return his goods. As these were not forthcoming, he confiscated a rifle and three daggers from the villagers, explaining to them that they would be returned to them on pro duction of the stolen goods. 2. Meanwhile, Mr. Hony proceeded on his next march. The villagers, however, went in haste to summon their local headman called Mirza ’Ali, a Kurdish Agha. Some three hours later the Kurds overtook Mr. Hony’s party. Five Kurds rush ed from behind a rock and seized the Qawwas’s horse and snatched awav his Lee- Enfield rifle. He shouted out and Mr. Hony, who was riding ahead, turned quickly back. The Kurds, on seeing his approach, drew their daggers and tried to load the Lee-Enfield. Some of the other Kurds ran for their own rifles. Mr. Hony and the Qawwas then fired their revolvers and shot mortally (al though they were unaware of it at the time) the Agha. The fight became general and the Kurds retired for reinforcements as they were put out at their Agha (who was locally reputed invulnerable) having been wounded. Incidentally he sustained part of his reputation as, after bein^ twice shot through the head and once through the chest, he survived some days. Eventually, by riding for their lives, Mr. Hony and his party arrived at another village. Fortunately for them, the villagers turned out to be enemies of the attack ers and drove these latter off. Next day Mr. Hony was able to reach Julamerk and lay his complaint before the Qaimakam. 3. Needless to say the enquiry held was a very one-sided affair as the Qai makam, a Kurd, was an ultra Committee man and a Hamidie officer. Mr. Hony’s telegrams to the Embassy were intercepted and he was practically kept a prisoner at Qudshanis (the seat of the Nestorian Patriarch) for a month. 4. On his return to Musal via Bibaydi he experienced a sinister sequel. The authorities gave him three Zabtiehs to accompany him. One of these, a Julamerk man, endeavoured to delay his departure on every pretext, and on the road he dawdled complaining his mule was lame, and used every device to keep the party back. Fortunately nothing happened and Bibaydi was reached in safety. It then turned out that the Zabtieh was a near relation of the late Agha Mirza ’Ali shot by Mr. Hony and that he had sent word to his tribe of Mr. Hony’s proposed journey in order that they might waylay and murder him. 5. On September 28th, Mr. Arthur Wliitley, Chief Engineer in Mesopotamia of Sir John Jackson, Ltd., wus married at the British Residency to Miss Roberts, sister-in-law of Captain Norman Scott, the British Vice-Consul. 6 6. Messrs. Stanley and Sparkes, electrical engineers, arrived at Baghdad towards the middle of September. They have been sent by the Shahbander Syndicate and See Summary for July 1912, n, 6. tlie National Bank of Turkey to report in a practical way on the electric tramway and the electric lighting scheme for Baghdad.Mr. Stanley told me in conversation that he had formed a very favourable im pression of both projects. The Engineers live out at the Shahbander’s house at Mu’azzam and aie in a good position to form a personal estimate of the large traffic between Baghdad and Mu’azzam. I understand from Mr. Stanley that the syndi cate have the right to construct tramways, within a radius of 15 Kilometres from either the North or East gates, besides the right to traverse the city and cross the new bridge, when it is built, and lay tram lines in what will be the new town. Mr. Stanley is of opinion that the construction of the tram lines will cost little and yield good immediate profits, but he thinks that, in the electric [lighting and ' power scheme, there is a far greater future. It will, he is of opinion, be possible to supply electric motors for irrigation purposes. The syndicate, he thinks, could afford to sell the unit electric force at such a cheap rate as to be able (while making a handsome profit) to quite cut out oil engines as a motor force for irrigating pur poses in the environs of Baghdad, and also to supersede the petroleum lamp as an illuminant in the houses. The great obstacle at present is the widening of the streets. This, however, See Summary for July. 1912. II, 6. SndertakeT 00 ” 16 ’ ^ ^ ^ th0Ug ’ lt W ‘ Se III.—British Indian Interests and Cases. 1. A reminder has been sent to the Public Prosecutor, asking when the trial j See last Summary, V, i. appeal of the assailants of Saiyid Muhammad, son of Azim Shah, is likely' to take place. No answer has been received as yet. 2. On September 25th, a carriage in which were some Bohrah pilgrims return ing from Karbala to Musayib was attacked by three mounted Arabs of the Anizah tribe midway between the two towns. The Arabs wounded the two horses with a lance and also wounded the driver and stole articles to the value of Rs. 170. Some other Arabs rode up and prevented the robbers completing their task and the carriage was able to reach Musayib in safety. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala has taken up the matter vigorously at Karbala, and I, at an interview with the- acting Wali, protested strongly about the unsafe state of the great pilgrim route. Monsieur Orloff, the Russian Consul-General, tells me he has also protested about the lack of public security between Baghdad and Karbala, but, he added, without any effect. 3. The Committee of the British Indian School at Karbala has been forced Sea Summary for March and April 1912, at last to Submit a petition to the Muta- v * 7 * sarrif, asking for a permit from the Wilayat to carry on the school. This is a result of a report sent in three months ago to the President of the Mi’arif by Salami Bey, Inspector of elementary schools, and also the Vice-Consul at Karbala asserts of the machinations of Shaikh ’Ali Mazinda- rani and the Turkish preacher, Muhammad Hassan, two noted enemies at Karbala of the Oudh Bequest and British interests in general. The British Vice-Consul reported the matter to me. I accordingly arranged to see the President of the Mi’arif. I found him outwardly very friendly (although the Vice-Consul suspects him of intriguing with Shaikh ’Ali Mazindarani) and he pointed out to me that the school committee petition was not in order on several points and that it would be necessary for them to resubmit it. Meanwhile he pro mised me he would not close the school. The position of this Moslem school under British protection is a peculiar one, and His Excellency the Ambassador has pointed out that the law in regard to it is not clear. The Vice-Consul at Karbala also reported during the month that the local authorities at Najaf had attempted to bring the Theological schools under some sort of Government control by appointing certain fixed Ulema as professors and by insist ing on prospective students obtaining certificates of scholarship from them.After obtaining the certificates, the candidates are to appear before a Turkish Government committee and be registered, and only then will be recognised as students. The Vice-Consul advised the Indian students not to comply with the Turkish demands, and I hear the matter has been dropped for the present. My Russian colleague told me his opinion was that it was only intended as a ruse to catch Ottoman subjects endeavouring to escape military service. 4. All the British merchants trading with Persia submitted through this Con sulate a joint petition, asking the Wilayat to grant an extention of the period of transit, during which time goods passing through Turkey to Persia only pay 1 per cent from b to 9 months. I am informed the native merchants likewise ap proached the Local authorities. I telegraphed to Plis Excellency the British Am bassador stating the case and, a few days later, he replied that the Central Customs had granted the privilege. IV.— British Official Matters. 1. A reminder was duly sent to the Wilayat in regard to Mr. Soane's case. No reply has so far been'received. 2. On the 27th of September Saiyid Sarfaraz Husain, Sub-Assistant Surgeon in the Indian Sub-Medical Department, and lately Consular Surgeon at Kirmanshah, and Yusef Khan, son of Mr. McDouall, the British Consul at Kirmanshah, were robbed between Khanaqin and Kizil-Rabat while on the journey from Kirman shah to Baghdad. It appears that the assailants were Zanganeh Kurds and colour is given to this by the information contained above {See part I above). The incident was reported to the Wilayat by the Qaimmakam and gendarmes were sent in pursuit, but without avail. Both parties lost articles to about the value of £ 20. I represented the matter strongly to the acting Wali at an interview. 3. The flag of the Residency and the Vice-Consulate at Karbala was kept at half mast on September 14th, the day of the funeral of the Emperor of Japan. 4 . The R. I. M. S.“ Comet ” returned from Basrah on September 26th. 5. The Mudir of Customs here, after a lapse of 7 years during which no ques tion has been raised, once more tried to levy duty on the drugs sent from India for the use of the Residency Dispensary. A few days later, the Mudir claimed a right to open and examine any stores destined for the Residency “ Stationaire ', the R. I. M. S. “ Comet '. The Mudir admitted the stores were duty free, but based his claim to examine the stores on the fact that all stores destined for the Embassy “ Stationaire ' were so treated. His Excellency the Ambassador, however, was able to arrange both matters favourably. The present Mudir is an honest man, it is said, but is a great stickler for the regulations. 6 6. The Vice-Consul at Karbala reports that Shaikh Ali Mazindarani, the Muj- tahid and Shaikh Hasan, the Turkish preacher, are busy plotting against the Oudh Bequest. Shaikh Hasan's hatred of the Indians is so great that, at the serai at Karbala in presence of the Mutasarrif, he publicly declared he would expel Abu Hanifah, the head of the Sunni religion, if he came to Turkey in the guise of an Indian. V.— Persian Affairs. f 1. Wasuq-ul-Saltanah, the Persian Vice-Consul at Karbala, has not received any salary for a very long time. He has had to come to Baghdad to endeavour to arrange matters with the Persian Consul-General here. If he cannot do so, he will have to go to Tehran. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala writes :—“ His (Wasuq-ul-Saltanah’s) failure to make an outward income by means just or cruel is due to his weakness and religion, which prevent him from following a course oftyranny and meanness like former Persian officials here. It has often happened that he and his family went whole days without food because they had no money and could get no credit 2. Under telegraphic orders from His Excellency the Ambassador, Mr. Soane, the British Vice-Consul at Kasrishn in, will shortly come to Baghdad to discuss certain points regarding the Turco-Persian frontier dispute with Mons. Orloff, the Russian Consul-General at Baghdad. 3. On August 19th, Yar Muhammad Khan with Musr.yib and Quli Khan and 300 Mujtahids arrived at Kirmanshah. They had deserted from Firman’s army near Senneh. They opened communications with Salar-ed-Dowleh. On September 3rd, Salar-ed-Dowleh arrived at Kirmanshah with Abbas Khan Juanrudi and some other Kurds. Salar-ed-Dowleh at once seized the Custom revenues. He paid a sum to Abbas Khan, who undertook to turn Firman Firmah out of Senneh. The tribes are employing an expectant policy and are not apparently keen to join either side. From private sources I learn that Firman Firma returned towards the close of September with his army from Senneh and entered Kirmanshah without a fight. Salar-ed-Dowleh and Yar Muhammad evacuated Kirmanshah before Firman Firma’s arrival in the direction of Senneh, where they are now. The armies passed in sight of one another, it is said, without exchanging a blow. The object of each of the Commanders appears to be plunder. The theory current here for some time of a tacit understanding between Salar-ed-Dowleh and Firman Firmah is now regarded as probably correct. Mr. McDouall, British Consul at Kirmanshah, thinks Firman Firmah’s love of money will in the end prove his undoing. The attraction of Kirmanshah is the Custom House revenues. Most of the Kurds have again joined Salar-ed-Dowleh, and Mr. McDouall writes that Salar-ed- Dowleh and Firman Firma may again exchange towns. The state and safety of the caravan routes remain deplorable. VX. Other Foreign Interests. 1. Suleyman Dakhil, the editor of the “ Riyadh ” has, as a sequel to the case brought against him by the Russian See last Summary, VII, 1. Embassy through their Consul-General, on account of his attacking in his newspaper the character of the Tsar, been sen tenced to 3 months’ imprisonment. He, however, left Baghdad before the sen tence was passed. In any case, by appealing he can delay his punishment some years without counting the likelihood of a superior Court quashing the sentence. 2. Dr. Max Hesse, the Imperial German-Consul, left Baghdad on September 9th en route for Europe. He is going on 9 months’ leave, but it is generally understood he will not return. Herr Kalisch will act for him in his absence. VII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. The Tigris remains exceptionally low. In consequence the navigation is much interfered with. The Idarah Nahrieh’s steamer “ Baghdad ” left here on the 12th of Septem ber with the Begum on board. This lady See Summary tor June 1912 , in, i. j ia( j engaged the entire steamer for herself and suite and had, I understand, also retained a British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamer at Basrah to take her to India.

The £ £ Baghdad ’ ’ had run out of coal and the Idareh had to hire Messrs. Lynch’s tug ££ Ishtar ” to bring coal up to it from Basrah.Messrs. Lynch proposed, through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, to bring down the Baghdad mail, which was on board the ‘ ‘ Mejidieh ’ ’ and block ed by the “ Baghdad,” by means of their launch “Bulbul”. The Wali, Mr Crow reports, seemed agreeable, but the Commodore would not agree and Mr. Crow thinks he has probably secret instructions from Constantinople never under any circumstances or even emergencies to permit Messrs. Lynch to run more than three steamers on the Tigris. NORMAN SCOTT, Certain, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and Acting Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad. British Residency and Consulate-General, Baghdad, 12th October 1912,^ in P CONFIDENTIAL. bw 4 ‘r £flt/osv ■ v 1912 , J Summary of events in Turkish ’Iraq during the month of August (received on 23rd September) 1912. ^ 1. The “ Diyadh ” newspaper of Baghdad reports that the Arab tribes of this province are withholding payment of the revenue due by them on account of the State lands that are in their cultivating possession. The paper adds that a sort of at Karbala, Shifathah, Tawairij, and Najaf having been ordered to prevent tribes men from making purchases at those places. According to the “ Riyadh,” the contumacy of the tribes is due to the removal of the late Wali, Jamal Bey, by the new Government of Turkey ; and there is of course no reason why they should not assign this, or any other reason as an excuse. But it will be remembered that difficulty in recovering this year's taxes was predicted by me last month as a result of the tribal gathering convened by the late Wali at the National Fete; and the arro gance engendered in the Arabs by their own superiority on that occasion has pro- bably a good deal to do with the present difficulty in collecting the Government revenues. 2. At the beginning of August raiding by sections of the Shammar tribe con tinued near Samarra. A large number of camels w r hich had been carried off were recovered by a force of gendermerie sent out from that place. 1. The most important of recent events, from the Turkish official point of view r , is the departure from Baghdad on the 17th August of the late Wali, Jamal Bey, whose resignation was accepted some time since. His resignation seems to have been due partly to fear regarding the nature of his treatment by the new Gov ernment, which it is understood w r ill enquire strictly into all cases of tampering with the parliamentary elections last spring, such as occurred at Baghdad, and partly to a desire to give some signal proof of his devotion to the chiefs of his party which may be remembered by them when (if ever) they come into power again. Jamal Bey visited me two days before his departure and told me that, as regarded his own future, “ he would probably enter Parliament or become Secretary to somebody.” With the inevitable sententiousness of the Turk, he add ed that “every man in this world could earn his livelihood by some means or an other.” It was not for me to remark that his political party might no longer have a sufficiency of parliamentary seats at their disposal, nor that a Turkish ex-Wali with a military training and no civil experience might find the competition of Armenians and other despised but intelligent classes severe in the struggle for a secretaryship. On my observing that the new Government would make a great mistake if they were to “ pursue,” by which I meant “ persecute,” the members of the Committee of Union and Progress, Jamal Bey hastily proceeded to answer on the assumption that it was a question of “ prosecuting ” the members of his faction. He seemed already to have given some thought to the subject, and his rejoinder was that there was no charge on which he or his colleagues^could be prose cuted, for their hands were clean, unlike those of the creatures of 'Abdul Hamid ; to take his own case as an instance, his savings would only suffice to carry him to Constantinople. It was afterwards pointed out to me that the ex-Wali’s pay here was £T. 250 a month, that he had held the post for nearly a year, and that his ex penses were to all appearance very small. Consequently his statement about his “ economies ” must be regarded with some doubt. Notwithstanding his fall, the ex-Wall's departure, which took place in the middle of a hot afternoon, was attended by the usual sycophantic crowed, some of them personal enemies wffio feared that Jamal Bey might one day return and remember their absence against them.

He had been more than a month at Kazimam near Baghdad, but he had not ventured to visit me during all that time on account of Jamal Bey swell-known anti-foreign sentiments.

The first excitement about the fall of the Committee of Union and Progress bemg now over, the opinion that no mere change of Government will or can make much difference m the present condition or future fate of the Turkish Empire, and hat the situation is therefore critical, appears to be very generally held at Baghdad. 2. Troubles connected with the superior civil staff in the districts of this pro vince prevail as usually and have perhaps been intensified by the advent of a new party to power. The important Mutassarifate of Karbala'remains unfilled, and the Acting Wah lately told me that he has no one fit to appoint to it. There have been dissensions at Samarra among the civil officials ; and the Qaim-Maqam there who was responsible for starting the whole difficulty about Indian Pilgrim Guides’ has been removed A former Qaim-Maqam of ’Aziziyah, dismissed by the late Wah has emerged from his obscurity and begun to intrigue for an appointment. The Qaim-Maqam of Khanaqm who was responsible for the interference at the frontier with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company^ carts, remains at his post; I under- stand, however, that he is not a Union and Progress official, but one of the old school and that he was not a favourite with the late Wali. Altogether administrative conditions are very unsettled. 3. Preparations for new parliamentary elections have already been begun at Baghdad but there seems to be a doubt in some minds whether, though deputies may be elected, any Parliament will be allowed to assemble or sit at Con stantinople. 4. Mustafa Pasha,_ chief of the Bajlan Kurds, whose detention at Baghdad was announced some Gme ago, was not kept a close prisoner while here. He ap peared to be the guest of Muhammad Pasha, Daghistani, though he did not live in 1 ^ r S i 10us 4 e ’ an(; f k. 6 seemed free to go about as he pleased in the town.

Fowler have found Mr. Bihs a useful agent, and whether the latter has good reasons for deferring to German susceptibi lities, as he seemed to imply that he was bound to do. P V. British Indian Interests and Cases. TurH^r ° f Sa r d Muhammad, a British Indian, who was assaulted by the Tuikish Police more than two years ago in order to extort a confession from him is still unsettled ; and such omens as there are as to the nature of its conclusion are unsatisfactory. Matters promised well last November, when two of the defin quents were sentenced to imprisonment by a Turkish Court; but the delay in executing the sentence became, after a time, suspicious; and I had in the end to press the Wilayat on the subject. The reply wis that the men condemned had appealed, and that execution of the sentence had accordingly been suspended ZlTCr b tf n '‘T ly tnle ; but 1 think the real in tention was that the case i b f ?, rg ? t , ten i % representations made it necessary that the appeal should be called for hearing; but the Dragoman who attended the case reported that it was manifestly the intention of the Court, if forced to come to a decision4 to acquit the appellants on various technical points. The present position is that the Public Prosecutor has taken the file of the case to read, that no date has been fixed for the further hearing of the appeal, and that a fresh attempt is in all probability being made to get the matter forgotten. Already the Turkish autho rities have profited considerably by the delay. The complainant, as well as a number of his witnesses, appear to have left Baghdad. 2. The services of the Indian Pilgrim Guide at Samarra continue to be highly appreciated ; and they are more valuable than usual at the present time when, in consequence of the interruption of the steamer service between Kazimain and Samarra, owing to the lowness of the river, the pilgrims mostly arrive by carriage on the western bank and have to cross the river at Samarra. A returning Indian pilgrim lately told me that the present Guide at Samarra wages a regular war with the drivers, ferrymen, and other extortioners of the place, and that some of these people had even threatened to kill him. 3. Replies have now been received from all the Persian distributors under the Oudh Bequest, whom I addressed at the end of July regarding their acceptance or non-acceptance of the new system, asking them for a definite statement of their position. Some of the answers are satisfactory,some unsatisfactory ; and I have reported to the Government of India on the situation by despatch, and have soli cited their approval to the course which it has seemed to me best to pursue. VI.— British Official Matters. 1. It is regrettable that the late Wali, in his treatment of the case of the firing on Mr. Soane, British Consul for Qasr-i-Shirin, latterly evinced a tendency to come short of the assurances which he gave in the beginning. Whereas the punish ment of the offenders was at first understood to be unconditionally promised, it now appears that the Wali has only requested the Commandant of the Army Corps to deal with the Officer ^Commanding the post and has directed the prosecu tion by the judicial authorities of the private soldier who^assaulted Mr. Soane's servant. The Wali also attempted to re-open the question of a reprimand which he said he had administered to the Qaim-Maqam of Khanaqin, and which he feared after receiving that official’s explanation, might have been unjust. I replied that I was not at all concerned about the reprimand to the Qaim-Maqam ; that the important thing was that the military offenders in the case should be promptly and adequately punished ; and that I hoped His Excellency would soon be able to give me satisfactory assurances on the latter point. I added that Mr. Soane’s case had not yet been raised officially by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Cons tantinople, but that action by the Embassy might become necessary if there were no satisfactory result from the local proceedings. The Wall’s reply to mv last letter was nonchalant in tone, he being then on the eve of departure ; and there seems to be a danger that in this case as in Saiyid Muhammad’s, the local autho rities will, if allowed, resort to elusive tactics. 2. Under orders from the Government of India to proceed to Simla on special duty without relinquishing my present appointment, I made over charge of the Residency to Captain Scott, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon and His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Baghdad, on the 31st August, and left next morning in the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” for Basrah. VII.— Foreign Interests. [Other than Persian and British]. 1. The Russian Consul-General at Baghdad is understood to be now prose cuting the native newspaper “ Riyadh ” in the Turkish Courts, under instructions from his Government, on account of an article attacking the Tsar, etc., in violent terms. VIII.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. The Tigris is very low this year, and the fall of the water has taken place phenomenally early in the season. Already at the beginning of August, the small steamer running on the upper river between Kazimain and Samarra had ceased to ply, and before the end of the month difficulties on the lower river had becomej 5 acute. The Turkish steamer “ Baghdad ” took 15 days to reach Basra from Baghdad ; and a small stern-wheeler of Agha JaTar’s was 20 days or more on the voyage from Basrah to Baghdad. The British mails were seriously delayed, the outward mail on at least one occasion missing connection at Basrah. r J. G. LORIMER, I. C.

August 1912.) ‘ '■ (Received on 19th I.—Internal Affairs. ; . . r, . . ; .... 1. The revolution that took place in Turkish politics during the month of July has already produced some effect at Baghdad. There is nothing resembling a crisis, however ; and the life of the people has not been in any way disturbed. The Committee of Union and Progress has never enjoyed any real influence in this Arab province except what it derived from intimidation; and, as far as can be judged, its present seeming fall is a relief and satisfaction to most classes. Jamal Bey, the Wali of Baghdad, is an extreme Union and Progress politician, and his official powers have been exerted to the full' to promote the bbjects of the Committee in the Wilayat. On the fall of the late Cabinet he seemed tb feel that his position had become unteiiabl6, and bn 6r about the 27th July he asked per mission by telegram to resign hik appoifitment. On the 1st August he announc ed that his resignation had been aece^ted,'and he i^nbw m the position of acting as a temporary substitute for his late self, but it is expected ' that 1 he will shortly be relieved. The Wali of Basriah, another Union and Progress partisan^ has also resigned or been dismissed. These local changes have been rendered more dramatic by their coincidence with the National Festival in a year in which, at Baghdad, efforts were being made to celebrate it \Vith unusual fervour and eclat. ■ A great gathering of Arabs organised by the Wali in honour of the 23rd July is noticed below ; and on the even ing of the day itself there Was a steamer'excursion, got up by the Wali, of which the proceeds were to benefit the schools of the Committee of Union and Progress at Baghdad. It was an evil omen, soon after fulfilled, that the steamer carrying the Wali struck on a sandbank opposite his own house at the beginning of the even ing and could not be got off for some hours. It is expected that the manipulation of the recent parliamentary elections here by the Committee of Union and Progress through officials belonging to their party will shortly be made the subject of a public enquiry. 2. On the 20th July, at a special full dress parade of the Officers and non commissioned officers of the Baghdad garrison at the town barracks, a Firman of the Sultan prohibiting the participation of the various ranks of the army in po litics was read. Verbal explanations were added to the effect that persons under military law must not even talk about politics and that they would be liable to punishment if they did. This seems to have been a last despairing effort of the Committee of Union and Progress to prevent the army from throwing its influence on the side of their opponents. 3. ’Umr Lutfi Bey, the Assistant Wali of Baghdad, expects to be relieved shortly on completing two years’ Service in Mesopotamia. He is not a party man, nor cast in a heroic mould, and his * chief preoccupation at present seems to be to escape being nominated as president or member of any disagreeable enquiry into the proceedings of the Union and Progress party while in power. He hopes to arrive at the rank of Wali some day by dint of seniority. It is a pity that really liberal and well-meaning men in Turkey are so weak as generally appears to be the case. Lutfi Bey practically said to me, in a recent conversation, that in Turkey a man must join one violent party or another or else keep out of politics altogether. 4. The great feature of the 23rd of July celebrations at Baghdad this year was the participation of a huge concourse of armed Arab tribesmen convoked by Hie Wali. The Arabs were collected in a camp outside the town, neat the fortified camp ; their number was at least 3,000, and some Turkish officials placed it at 4,000. The Wall’s idea, which was no doubt suggested by events in Tripoli, seems to have been to demonstrate the strength of the Arab tribes of the Wilayat and their attachment to the Turkish Government—a truly Union and Progress piece of bravado. C360FD/ 2 A limited number of Shaikhs, each with a fixed number of followers, were invited, but others came in who had not been sent for, even from beyond the bounds of the \\ ilayat, and those who had been invited showed an unfortunate tenden cy to increase their importance by bringing retinues larger than those prescribed for them. A few days before the National Festival Baghdad began to be alarm ed by an influx of armed Arabs into the town such as had never been seen in living memory. The Christians in particular became uneasy, not without reason, for the Arabs showed a tendency to confound all Europeans with Italians, signs suggestive of throat-cutting were made to non-Mussulmans by passing Arab cavaliers, and spears and unloaded rifles were pointed in jest. The German Consul and the European gunner of the “ Comet ' were slightly threatened with weapons ; a sailor of the “ Comet ” was called on as a Muham madan to remove his cap with the ship’s ribbon; and a Goanese cook had his hat knocked off in the street. The Commander of the Army Corps is understood to have telegraphed to Constantinople disclaiming responsibility for the safety of the town, and the Wali to have been called on by the Government for explanations. Eventually the Wali seems to have received instructions not to send any Arabs away who had arrived, but to prevent the arrival of more, as far as possible. On this the roads to Baghdad from the west and south were closed, and hundreds—or, according to some accounts, thousands—of Arabs were turned back. On the eve of the Festival apprehensions prevailed. The unstable position of affairs at Constantinople was a disquieting factor; but more immediate was the danger of a disturbance among the Arabs, where the representatives of mu tually hostile tribes were jostling together without effective supervision. An Arab riot might easily have led to the use of arms by the Baghdad military garrison, which the Arabs greatly outnumbered, and the result would have been disorder' full of peril for the peaceful population, especially shopkeepers and Christians, and above all Europeans. As the best chance of matters passing off quietly seemed to lie in the YVali’s programme being carried out as arranged, I did not refer to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople; but such unobtrusive precautions as the circumstances seemed to require were taken at the Residency. On the morning of the 23rd July a parade of troops and Arabs took place in the desert outside the city. My foreign colleagues and I were present by invitation. The Arabs marched past after the troops and were about twice as numerous. They were nearly all armed, and those who carried rifles, as a large proportion did, wore belts full of cartridges. There were few genuine Bedouins among them: most belonged to settled or semi-settled tribes. From first to last, fortunately, no serious hitch or accident occured. The political effect of the demonstration as a whole is likely to be unfortunate While the Arabs were here there was a general feeling that they were the real masters of the town. They, on their part, have probably carried with them to their homes a vivid recollection of the poor figure which the principal Turkish garrison of the province cut beside them. If the revenue/ of the outlying districts is got in with more than the usual difficulty this year, the reason will not be far to seek. The Wali had frequent interviews with the Arab Shaikhs at the Sarai, in their camp—where ao one meeting he bestowed kerchiefs and robes of honour on all of them, and even at his own house. On the two days preceding the festival (the 21st and 22nd July) special gatherings were held for their benefit at the Union and Progress Clubs, but the Wali was not present at these. Committee orators who would gladly see every Arab, like every Albanian, disarmed descant ed on the military virtues and Islamic zeal of the Arabs, exorting them to keep their arms in good order and not turn them against one another but reserve them for use against foreign aggressors. Like many other Union and Progress displays this one had a great deal of nauseating make-believe about it; and the Shaikhs, though they did not fail to profess loyalty to the Sultan and the Government, showed no anxiety to become members of the Committee.5. The Shammar have again* been giving trouble near Samarrah by threat- * See Summary for September 1911, 1 . 2 . enin .g the ' Anizah. On the day of the National Festival some gendarmes were sent out against them from Samarrah and returned with two men wounded but having captured a couple of mares from the Arabs. A gendarmerie reinforcement from Baghdad has since reached Samarrah and the arrival of troops there is ex pected. 6. Various town improvements were under discussion at Baghdad, not for the first time, when the late political crisis occurred. Among these were the widening of the streets, the introduction of electric tramways, the erection of an iron bridge over the Tigris, and a number of less important projects such as the construction of a large race-course with grand stand outside the North Gate. The projeedings in regard to these will be stopped by the Wall's resignation; and some of the projects which were personnel whims of his, such as the race-course will no doubt be abandoned. * 7. On the 12th of July a fire occurred in the Baghdad bazaar and a number of houses and shops were destroyed. Among them were a warehouse belonging to Haji Hamud, a British subject, and a native pharmacy which was insured with a British Company ; in the latter case the contents of the building were saved. The fire pumps of the R.I.M.S. “ Comet ” took part as usual in extinguishing the conflagration. This is the third large fire which has occurred in Baghdad during the summer ; and, had the day not fortunately been windless, which is rare at this season of the year, a large part of the town might have been devas tated. 8. The following data relating to the finances of the Baghdad V ilayat are of interest: they have been specially obtained. Revenue actually collected during the Turkish year 1327 (i.e., 14th March 1911 to 13th March 1912). £. stg. Tent tax Sheep-tax Forests Land registration Rent of state properties Court Fees Educational receipts .. Baghdad municipal revenue Agricultural “ Tithes ” Total 6,509 .. 36,523 .. 1,250 .. 10,706 501 .. 2,360 .. 12,513 .. 15,200 .. 169,951 .. 255,513 Besides the above there are some minor sources of revenue which bring the total up to about £270,000. The total expenditure during the year in the Wilayat was about £300.000. There was thus apparently a deficit of about £30,000 in the local finances. It should be noted that all military expenditure is included in the above figures except the cost of the new Frontier Companies ', which must as yet be small. On the other hand the large net receipts of the Baghdad Customs House, Posts and Telegraphs, and Public Debt Department are accounted for direct to Constantinople and do not figure in the local budget. It follows that, from the point of view of the Turkish Ministry of Finance, Baghdad must be a satisfactory and surplus-yielding W ilayat. The revenue from “ tithes ' is of importance in its bearing on the probable return to capital from irrigation works. The so-called “ tithes 'are not true tithes, assessment being frequently at the rate of one-fifth, or even more, of gross produce. Of the sum collected last year in tithes £68,448 was recovered directfrom cultivators by government agency, and £101,503 was paid into the Treasury by contractors to whom tithes had been farmed. The following are the statistics of tithes for some previous years Year. Recovered by Govern ment. Paid by contrac- . tors. Total. £. T. £. T. £.

T. 170,636=£. stg. 153,572. The question of most immediate interest is the extent to which tithes ” will be increased by the completion of the Hindiyah Barrage only, without any concurrent scheme of canals or colonisation. No forecast of the increase can at present be framed and I think that financiers are inclined to exaggerate its probable amount. XI.—British Interests and Cases. i Mr. Soane, British Vice-Consul for Qasr-i-Shirin, came into Baghdad to assist in the discussion of his own case with * See last Summary, II. 3. t k e Wilayat. The Wali had in the mean- time sent a commission consisting of one civil and one military officer to Khanaqm to visit the scene of the firing and report on the facts. The formal interview took place at the Sarai on the 14th July, and the results were confirmed by the Wall m an official letter to me dated the 16th. The Turkish case was that Mr. Soane was fired on in ignorance of his identity and of his being a European, but that the firing was unnecessary and reprehensible, and that theas^ilt on and robbery of Mr. Soane’s servant was not in any way justifiable. The Wall has accordingly undertaken to move the Commander of the Army Corps to inflict a suitable pums i- ment on the Commandant of the post from which Mr. Soane was fired on and to cause the offender (a soldier) in the case of the servant to be prosecuted accord- ins to law. His Excellency stated that it had also been decided to transfer the offending Commandant and the entire garrison to some other frontier post. In view of the fact that the distance at which fire was opened on Mr. Soane was verv considerable, of the W’ali’s having twice expressed regret at the incident once in writing to the Resident and once personally to Mr Soane, and of the assurances givtn in regard to the punishment of those chiefly responsible, His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’ Affaires at Constantinople has decided that it is unnecessary fir him, for the present at least, to raise the question with the Turkish Government and that, provided the military authorities do not openly protect their guilty subordinates, the incident may be treated as closed. On receiving instructions from Mr. Marling I wrote officially to the W ah asking that he w inform me in due course of the punishment inflicted on the delinquents, and pen - ing his reply the matter remains open. As regards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s road between Khanaqm in Turktv Ini Chia Surkh g in Persia, the Wali has given repeated and explicit assur- ^ rr +ViqI no stpus will be taken to close it* asserts that the action of the Qaim-Maqam of Khanaqin in trying to impose restrictions on theCompany’s carts coming and going by this road was unauthorised, and that the official in question has been severely censured for his misconduct. The decision in favour of the road remaining open is highly satisfactory, and without the acci dent to Mr. Soane it might not have been so easily obtained. 2. It has been necessary to address the Local Government regarding a fire wood depot that exists in the middle of Baghdad town and is contiguous to the house of Mr. G. Thaddeus, a British subject and pensioned employe of this Besi- dency. The depot is a serious danger to neighbouring houses, both by way of fire and as providing burglars with a sort of scaling ladder ; a burglary attributable to its existence was the original cause of my taking action. The Wali answered my first official communication in a temporising manner ; on my second, written after • See I. 7 above and Summary for May. II. thr ^* serious ^es had taken place in the n and VIII. 4. town, ne tried to evade discussion by alleg ing that the matter was one of immoveable property. In reply I pointed out that the personal safety of the Thaddeus family also entered into the question, and I gave it as my deliberate opinion that His Excellency would incur a heavy responsibility by declining my reasonable request that he should draw the attention of the Municipality to the matter. The Munici pality had in fact, before I took any steps in the matter, been approached by Mr. Thaddeus and other householders with a petition ; but months have passed since then without anything being done. The Wali’s reply to mv final letter was rude and unsatisfactory, being written as I think on the day that he tendered his resignation ; but the correspondence exchanged will be sufficient, in case of an accident due to default by the Municipality, to fix some responsibility on the Wilavat as well. 3. The Farmanf for the construction by the Church Missionary Society of t See last Summary, ii. i. a ? ew . ^spital near Baghdad has been re- . , , . ceived from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, checked, and delivered to the acting head of the Mission at Baghdad (the Rev.

VI. 5 . satisfactorily to the suggestion}: made to . ,, -pj . . | .. . , them some time since that avoidable delays m the British mail service should be reduced. During the first quarter of 1912 the average day of arrival of the mail at Baghdad was Friday, and on three occasions it did not arrive till Saturday and on three occasions not till Sundav. During the second quarter the average day of arrival was Wednesday, the mail only once arrived so late as Friday—the former average day, and twice it actually reached Baghdad on Monday. 5. Mr. R. I. Money, the Consulting Engineer of the National Bank, Constanti nople, arrived at Baghdad overland towards the end of June and remained over a month. He twice visited the Hindiyah Barrage. I understand from him, very confidentially, that the principal object of his mission was to report, for the satisfaction of Sir E. Cassel, on the significance of some cracks which had appeared in the new Hindiyah Barrage as partially con structed by Sir John Jackson, Limited. I am glad to be able to add that, in Mr. Money’s opinion, the cracks are superficial and of no importance. While here Mr. Money telegraphed to the National Bank, by the medium of this Residency and His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, suggest ing that, as the Turkish Government grant of £. T. 5.5,000 for the Mesopotamian irrigation works for the year was nearly exhausted, the Bank might negotiate with the Turkish Government for a lien on the permanent contract in consideration of their advancing the money necessary to carry the Hindivah Barrage and con nected works, now nearly finished, to completion without a check. I understand that immediate action was taken by the Bank on this suggestion. Later Mr. Money telegraphed to Constantinople that the following sums were required to finish the works in hand :— Hindiyah Barrage Hillah Channel connected with Barrage .. Habbaniyah Escape C360FD £. .. 107,000 .. 6,000 .. 334,000At the same time he reported that, if a regular supply of funds could be assured, the works below could probably be completed by the times shown:— Hindiyah New Barrage Hindiyah Subsidiary Barrage .. Deviation connected with Barrage Dam connected with Barrage .. Hillah Channel . .. April 1913. .. April 1913. .. May 1913. . .. September 1913. .. March 1913. 6. Mr. Money spent a good deal of time, which must now I fear be considered wasted, in discussing municipal improvements with the Wali of Baghdad, since resigned. The opening up of the town, electric tramways, and the iron bridge were the chief topics ; and Mr. V hitley, Sir John Jackson’s local representative, was asked by the Wali to prepare a plan of the town, besides which he undertook experimental borings in connection with the proposed bridge. There is some reason to think that the Baghdad Railway authorities were separately invited to interest themselves in both matters and that they also have been quietly taking observations. Mr. Money seemed to be impressed by a scheme of the Wali for expropriating strips of lands in the town 3. or 4 times as wide as are required for streets and for reselling the side portions to the public at enhanced prices, thus meeting the cost of the changes without any great expenditure unless by way of a temporary ad vance. I was surprised to find that Mr. Money reported the Baghdad Tramwavs to the Bank as a promising scheme. I should have said that both they and the street widening project were risky business. The natural future of Baghdad lies outside the present bounds of the city, perhaps on the other side of the river where the railway station will be; and, this being so, capital sunk in far-reaching im provements to the old town cannot be expected to yield a proper return. Of course with the help of the Government artificial expedients could be brought into action in aid of favoured capitalists. To maintain ground values in the old town the formation of new quarters could be forbidden ; and in the same way, to assure an adequate return to financiers building an iron bridge, the present wooden bridge could be abolished and restrictions imposed on ferries; but such measures would not be in the public interest. Mr. Money had a count made while he was here and found that about 30,000 persons crossed the present single bridge daily. III. —British Indian Interests and Cases. Nil IV. —British Official Matters. 1. The Turkish intrigues against our administration* of the Oudh Bequest still ♦ See last Summary, IV. 3. continue. The departure of the present V\ all may make a difference, but the ball which he has set rolling will perhaps be difficult to stop. On the 11th July the “Zuhur” the usual press organ of the Wali, contained in extenso a petition, signed by some of the present Mujtahid distributors under the Bequest and addressed to the Shaikh-ul-Islam and the Wali himself, in which the new Bequest arrange ments were attacked. Only one of the present distributors is a Turkish subject, and with him, under my recent temporary agreement with the Wali, I cannot communicate direct. The Indian distributors are loyal. But the opportunity seemed a good one for requiring such of the distributors as are Persian subjects, with whom the Wali had no right to interfere and who form a large majority on the Committees, to state categorically in writing whether they adhere to the new arrangements or not. I t See Annexure A. ^ ave accordingly addressed to each of them separately the letter of which a translation is appended below.f The Wali lately interrogated with strictness Salih, the Jewish banker of the two Bequest Committees, and indicated that as an Ottoman subject he ought to re linquish his connection with them. The Sarraf tells me he replied that his relations with the Committees were of a business character and that, unless His Excellencywas prepared to compensate him for loss of business, he was not in a position to forego employment by them. One of the last acts of the Wali before his resignation was to deport to Persia a son of Shaikh Hadi, one of the Persian Mujtahid distributors at Karbala under the Oudh Bequest. Before his expulsion the man was detained for three days in police custody at theBaghdad Sarai. So far as can be ascertained the reasons for treating him as a political offender were that he had frequently represented his fath er on the Oudh Bequest Committee at Karbala and that he was on friendly terms with the British Vice-Consul there. The policy of the Wali seems to have been to deter all except British subjects from assisting in the work of the Bequest and even from holding intercourse with the British Vice-Consulate; and it appears not improb able that, if he had remained longer, he might have tried to apply it at the next dis tribution to the poor of non-British natioqjlity who came to the Committee for relief. 2. During July the British Vice-Consul spent a week or two at Baghdad, where I had summoned him to discuss the qualifications and claims of various persons to be appointed distributors under the Oudh Bequest in case vacancies should occur. The Wali seems to have had a watch kept, through the police, on Mr. Muhammad Hasan's movements at Baghdad. The Vice-Consul has frequently complained to me of the temptations to which he is exposed at Karbala by the offer to him of bribes. Some time since he was tendered £. T. 50 by an Arab with some young relations liable to military service who wished to be registered as a British subject. On his present visit to Baghdad Mr. Muhammad Hasan brought with him £. T. 80 in gold and a bill for £. T. 60 which had been given him by a candidate for a distributorship under the Oudh Bequest, and which, he said, he had pretended to accept. His object was to give me ocular demonstration of the truth of his complaints. After reproving the Vice-Consul for his inconsiderate action I had a telegram sent summoning the bribe-giver, a Persian, to Baghdad ; and on his arrival, no doubt in full expectation of being appointed a distributor, the money was returned to him in the presence of the Vice-Consul, Mr. Money of the National Bank, and myself. I read the delin quent a suitable homily, but told him that his claims would be impartially con sidered in due time, his improper conduct being for once overlooked. He appeared much abashed and had nothing to say for himself. I have full confidence in the honesty of Mr. Muhammad Hasan who has worked under me now for nearly three years and who seems to be universally respected; but I foresee that his post will be a difficult one to fill when, as must happen sooner or later, he takes long leave or vacates it permanently. V. —Persian Affairs. 1. The state of communication between Baghdad and its commercial markets in Persia is very unsatisfactory. The roads are generally open \f&gt; a sense, but every now and then a great raid upon a caravan takes place, causing loss and alarming merchants. In June a highway robbery occurred at Harunabad, on this side of Kirmanshah, in which over 200 loads of merchaudise were taken; of these 18, worth £400, belonged to the British firm of Blockey Cree and Co., Baghdad. Con fidence had only begun to revive when, in July, another Baghdad caravan was attacked at Bisitun beyond Kirmanshah; this time more than 150 loads were lost. Messrs. Blockey Cree and Company have made several representations to this Residency regarding the state of the Persian roads, and at their instance the ques tion has been referred to higher authority; but it seems clear that the matter is one in which the British Government cannot assume any responsibility and that mer chants who deal with Persia must, in present circumstances, do so entirely at their own risk. 2.

They argue that, being now assimilated as regards taxation and in all other respects to Ottoman subjects, it is a sheer waste of money to pay any thing to the Persian Consular authorities. 3. Mustafa Pasha*, Bajlan, is now detained at Baghdad as a political suspect under the orders of the Wali. From this ♦See Summary for May, in. 4. wou } ( j seem that there is really a quarrel between him and the Wali and that Mustafa Pasha’s declarations to Mr. Soane were sincere. Mr. Soane writes to me that Mustafa Pasha’s relations are seriously con cerned about his treatment by the Turks, and from his letter it would seem that they attribute it to the ordinary friendly relations which the Pasha has had in the past with Mr. Soane, and on which the Wali has placed some sinister political construc tion. VI.—Other Foreign Interests. 1. I understand confidentially from Messrs. S. Lynch and Co.’s Baghdad mana ger that a draft agreement concerning the transport f of Baghdad Railway materi als from Basrah to Baghdad has been drawn fSee Summary for May, vii. i. U p an( j initialled in Europe by the repre sentatives of the parties concerned. According to Mr. Tod the capital of the new Transport Syndicate which is to be formed for the purpose will be £50,000, divided in equal shares between Britain, Germany and Turkey. Any portion of the share allotted to the Turkish assignees which they may fail to cover is to be redistributed equally between the British and the German subscribers. The tugs and barges required are to be obtained half from Britain and half from Germany, and the scheme will probably be in actual operation by next November. Under the present agreement the traffic management of the Syndicate would be entirely in the hands of Messrs. Lynch, but it seems to be feared that this part of the arrangement has not yet been fully settled. 2. The first sod of the Baghdad Railway was cut here on the morning of the 27th July by the Wali of Baghdad in the presence of some hundreds of invited guests. Speeches were made by Meissner Pasha and the Wali, but they contained nothing of note. In the evening a great open air dance and supper were given by Meissner Pasha; they were probably the largest and best organised entertainment of the sort ever seen at Baghdad. 3.

General and Miscellaneous. Nil J. G. LORIMER, I.C.S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and B. B. MAs Consul-General Baghdad. British Residency and Consulate General, Baghdad, 5th August 1912.ANNEXURE A. TO ALL PRESENT DISTRIBUTORS UNDER THE OUDH BEQUEST WHO ARE PERSIAN • subjects:. Baghdad, 24th July 1912. Sir, A short time ago you accepted money from the Oudh Bequest under the new arrangements established by the Government of India. Now I am informed, to my surprise, that you have protested against these new arrangements and have complained to the Wali of Baghdad and to the Shaikh-ul-Islam at Constanti- nople. I therefore ask you to let me know in writing, without delay, (1) whether you approve of the Oudh Bequest new arrangements, or not; (2) whether you are ready to support the new arrangements by taking part in the public distributions, or not; and (3) whether your complaint to the Turkish authorities was compelled or voluntary. Your reply should be sent through the British Vice-Consul at Karbala and should reach him within one week from the delivery of the present letter into your hands If no answer is received from you within the week, or if your reply on each of the three points mentioned above is not satisfactory, I shall assume that you do not wish to be any longer connected with the Bequest under the new arrangements, and I shall consider myself at liberty to appoint in your place someone who appro\ - es of the new system and who understands better than you appear to do the advan tages which it confers on poor and deserving persons, in strict conformity with the intentions of the King of Oudh. No verbal renlv to this letter will be taken into consideration, and, if a writ- ten reply is expressed^ vague or conditional terms, it will be treated as a resigns- tion of your appointment as distributor. Pray accept, etc., (Sd.) J. G. LORIMER. G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C-360 F. D.—24*8-12.—.17—H.C.S.L.MMEMM CONFIDENTIAL ’ Summary of events in Turkish Arabia during June 1912. (Received on 22nd July 1912.) I.—Internal Affairs. 1. Under orders from Constantinople the European method of reckoning the time of day has been substituted, at Baghdad, for the native system. Clocks and watches will not keep native time, which is calculated backwards from the variable hour of sunset; but its abolition is regarded with dissatisfaction by some Muham madans as an innovation of European, that is of Christian, origin. 2. The Wali has ordered a careful census to be taken of Baghdad city, by wards. It is to be precisely ascertained, as regards Muhammadans, how many of them are Sunnis and how many ShTahs ; and in the case of foreigners religion, length of residence at Baghdad, nationality, and the fact of possession or non possession of a certificate of foreign nationality are to be recorded. 3. The Wali has announced his intention of forming a zoological collection at Baghdad. It is to be kept in the Municipal Garden next the British Residency. He is also organising an industrial exhibition. II— British Interests and Cases. 1. A Forman* authorising the building of a hospital by the Church Missionary Society was obtained in the course of June *See Summary for March,— April, V-8. g r ^ ann i c Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. The submission of the Society to the Turkish Government's conditions in the present case is not, however, to prejudice the general question of the privileges of British philanthropic institutions in Turkey. % In the case of Messrs. Mashal Brothers the Wali, in accordance with my request|, supplied me with a copy of the text tSee last Summary vui - 2 . 0 f fae Turkish law regarding Foreign Anony mous Companies (1906). Under this law, for the application of which t &gt;vo Butish firms in Turkey no arrangements have yet been made between the Porte and His Britannic Majesty’s Government, foreign companies are permitted to do busi ness in Turkey only upon certain conditions. One of these conditions is that they “ su bmit to Turkish law”, a provision which is probably intended to exclude con sular assistance, as in the case of questions relating to immoveable property ; and , another is that they must disclose the amount of their capital and other particulars to the Turkish Government. Under instructions from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador I have informed Mr. J. H. Mashal that there is no prospect of his firm being allowed to establish a workshop at Baghdad unless they comply with the law in question ; and it has been left to him and his firm to decide whether or not they shall so comply at their own risk. One of the penalties provided by the law for doing business otherwise than in accordance with its requirements is that offending companies will not be allowed to sue though they may be sued, in the Turkish courts. I have warned the acting Manager of the Eastern Bank, which also commenced operations at Baghdad with out satisfying the requirements of the law in question, of the risks to which the Bank is exposed under this penalty. 3 The An^lo-Persian Oil Company possess an oil field at Ohia Surkh m Peisia, not far from tho Turkish frontier at Khanaqin, which they are now preparing to exploit more energetically than in the past Baghdad is the port of this oil field and will be one of the markets for its produce. Some years ago the Company made a road from Khanaqin to Chia Surkh and hitherto it has been freely used by their carts customs formalities being, I understand, performed at Khanaqm. Lat- terlv however, the Turkish Qaim-Maqam of Khanaqin objected to the free use of the rood bv the Company, stating that he did so under orders from superior au- thoritv On or about the 24th June he seems to have had a discussion with Mr. Soane, ’the Oil Company’s Manager at Chia Surkh and British Vice-Consul for C235FD ' \ 12AU61S12 jQasr-i-Shirin, in which he insisted that only one particular cart belonging to the Company should cross the frontier in future by the Company’s road, and that it should not make more than one journey daily. On receiving news of this obstruc tive action through me, Mr. Harvey, the Company’s representative at Baghdad, took up the matter with the Baghdad Wilayat. Meanwhile on the 25th June, in returning from Khanaqin to Chia Suikh by the road in question, Mr. Soane was fired on from a Turkish frontier post. About 30 shots were fired in all, and Mr. Soane was made to dismount and walk to the post, where he was most uncivilly received by the Commandant. He was simply told that he had been fired on because he was cantering, and a threat was added of sending him back to Khanaqin under a guard. I did not receive news of this occurrence till the 30th June, when I immediately protested in writing to the local authorities, informed His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople and requested Mr. Soane by telegram to come ta Baghdad. It is as yet too early to express any opinion about the incident, for Mr.. Soane’s report to me, though in writing and carefully expressed, is necessarily not complete in every particular, and the Turkish verison of the affair is still unfor mulated. Ill,—B ritish Indian Interests and Cases. 1. The Haidarabad* lady on pilgrimage in this country is, I find, •See last Summary. * he wid ° W of the Mukram-ud-Daulah, her own name being Nawab Nur-un-Nisa Begam. During a prolonged stay at Kazimain she gave a series of entertainments to ’Ulama, Khuddams, merchants, Indians, and Turkish officials, also one to the female relatives of these classes. She is now visiting Karbala and Najaf. 2, The registration of themselves and their ' families by Indian subjects at Baghdad and Karbala has received a great impulse since His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was pleased to authorise the remission of the fee in the&gt; case of indigent persons. Great care is exercised in issuing certificates to new ap plicants, and in a large proportion of cases their statements are sent to the authori ties of their native districts in India for verification. It now looks as if, in course of time, the great bulk of the British Indian community in the Baghdad Wilayat might come to be properly registered, which is not the case at present.. Increasing pressure by the Turkish authorities upon individuals of doubtful nationality has: perhaps something to do with the more favourable attitude of His Britannic Majesty’s Asiatic subjects here towards registration. On a recent tour to Tawairij and Hillah the British Vice-Consul, Karbala,, after completing the British Indian registrations at both places reported the num ber of British subjects at the former to be 89, and the latter 54 souls; these figures, include women and children. 3. The Chief of Police at Baghdad lately enquired of the Residency Second Dragoman, who is employed chiefly on Indian business, whether the British Consul- General would be prepared to co-operate with the ^ ali in expelling from the country such Indians settled here as are without an apparent calling or ostensible means of livelihood. The reference in this instance seemed to be less to Shi’ahs visiting the Holy Cities than to Sunni students and devotees at the shrine of ’Abdul Qadir in Baghdad, who often remain for a considerable time, or even perma nently. I have told the Dragoman to reply politely that this Consulate-General has no funds for the wholesale repatriation of Indians, also that expf^feion would be legal in English law only in cases where something unfavourable could be proved against the individual. I added that I was, and always had been, ready to co operate with the Turkish authorities in investigating complaints of crime or bad livelihood against Indians, but that such complaints were fortunately very rare. 4, With the arrival of the hot weather the Shi’ah pilgrimages from India are ceasing for the season. During June the number of Indian pilgrims assisted by the Oudh Bequest Pilgrim Office was 95, including women and children. The favourite season is from November to April.3 IV.— British Official Matters, 1. His Majesty the King Emperor’s birthday was duly celebrated at Baghdad and Karbala on the 3rd June. At Baghdad an official reception was held by the Besident in the cool of the morning and was attended by the V ali with his Director of Political Affairs and the Commandant of the Army Corps, well as by the Foreign Consuls, and others. In the afternoon a garden party was given in the Residency grounds to about 80 European British subjects, and in the evening, along with an illumination, there was an entertainment for Indian British subjects at which about 150 were present, 2. Soon after the return of the Pilgrim* Guide expelled from Samarra to his post there, the man reported that the ♦See last Summary, vi-i. Qaim-Maqam had objected to his wearing an ordinary turban when praying in the mosque. The argument, apparently, was that having received a special cap and badge he ought to wear these and no thing else. The particular Guide in question is a Saiyid and wears ^ a grCen turban when not on duty. I brought the Guide’s complaint to the notice of the ( V ali, who wrote to me four days later that he had instructed the Qaim-Maqam not to interfere with the wearing of anything except unauthorised uniforms. From the interval of time which elapsed it may be inferred that the \\ ali made enquiries and found that the Qaim-Maqam had really acted as described, especially as it was added in the letter that a further charge against the Qaim-Maqam-of uttering abusive language was denied by that official, 3. The Turkish authorities seem inclined to persist in their intimidationt of I natives of the country, other than British fSee last Summary \ 1-3. subjects, who connect themselves in any way with the Oudh Bequest, The British Vice-Consul, Karbala, reports that many of the Persian paupers at Najaf who received alms in the last Bequest distribution have been sent for and threatened by the Qaim-Maqam. The policy seems to be to single out those whose claim to Persian nationality is at all weak, and, by alarming these, to spread a general panic. On tour at Tawarij and Hillah Mr. Muhammad Hasan received hearty congra tulations from Shi’ahs of some religious prominence on the late successful reor ganisation of the Oudh Bequest. At Tawairij his interlocutor was Saiyid Hadi (Qazvini), “ the most influential resident and landed proprietor ” ; at Hillah it was SaiyidJ Muhammad (Qazvini), a lead ing local ecclesiastic. Their opinions are of value as those of men who do not live at Karbala or Najaf, yet are near enough to be in touch with opinion there, and who have themselves no personal interests to serve, e It has been necesssary to bring to a settlement the case of the Persian § Muj- ec , c M ,, 0 , 01^0 tahid Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani), whose § See Summary tor March 1910, IX -2, ^ ^ wa8 suspended by me in 1910 pending the receipt of orders from the Government of India for the reorganisation of the Bequest arrangements. This is the man who two years ago refused to appear and discuss Bequest affairs, as the other Mujtahid distributors did, and who at the same time would not agree to the ar rangement accepted (and afterwards loyally adhered to) by other Karbala distn- butors, whereby two-fifths of their shares were thrown into a common fund to be disbursed by a Committee. After the arrival of the Government of India’s orders in January 1912 the British \ ice-Consul at Karbala twice, under mr m- struct’ons, visited Shaikh Husain and offered him a share as large as that of any distributor (and larger than those of all but one) at Karbala, on condition of his accepting the principle established by the Government of India as regards only one half of the share being at the personal disposal of the distributor, and of his under taking to be present occasionally at distributions and at other times to send a representative to them. Shaikh Husain, howepver, adopted an unreasonable and even insolent tone to the Vice-Consul and declined to discuss future arrangements until an agreement was reached about his so-called arrears since 1910. As his colleagues had in the interval been voluntarily disbursing tw r o-fifths ♦This is the man who attacked the manage ment of the Bequest two and a half years ago. See Summary for December 1909—January 1010, VII-1,of their allowances through the Committee and as the Government of India had accepted the principle that one-half of each distributor’s allowance ought to be so disbursed, I had decided that only half of the “ arrears ” should be paid to him personally. The negotiations actually broke down on this point, which he chose to treat as a preliminary one, through his demanding that the whole should be paid him unconditionally ; but it was clear from his whole attitude that he had no real intention of co-operating in the work of the Bequest on the lines which have now been laid down. I have therefore sent him the letter * Annexure A to this Summary. of which a copy* is attached. It should draw from him, m case his position has been in any respect misunderstood, an explanation of what that position really is. The increased share which I had arranged for him (Rs. 800 instead of Rs. 500 a month) has not yet been granted to anyone else, and it is accordingly not too late for him to obtain it by giving satisfactory guarantees of an intention to conform to the new system. Shaikh Hussain is of more importance as a Mujtahid than I had been led to suppose, but this disposition is even more unfavourable than at first appeared, and much of the opposition to reform seems to have proceeded from himself and a brother named Shaikh 'Ali who is a notorious political intriguer and who has worked to the best of his ability on the political suspicions of the Turks. 4. Mr.,Muhammad Hasan, the British Vice-Consul at Karbala, was on tour from the 9th to the 14th of June. He visited Tawairij and Hillah, where he held meetings of the resident British Indians, discussed their affairs with them, attended to registration, and selected a Lambardar or headman, for the internal affairs of the Indian community at each place. 5. The Indian medical subordinate till lately attached to His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate at Kirmanshah (Mir Mushtaq ’Ali) passed through Baghdad during June on his return journey to India. He brought with him a quantity of hospital furniture and surgical instruments and appliances, the transfer of which to Baghdad was ordered some time since, and which will be most useful in the Residency dispensary here. 6. About the beginning of June one Kadhim-ad-Dujaili, an individual who took a prominent part in the agitation against the fusion of the Idarah Nah- riyah with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company at the end of 1909, visited the Residency First Dragoman and said that he had come as the spokes man of numerous Arabs on the Tigris above and below Baghdad who wished to place themselves under British protection. Mr. Nersessian replied that the pro posal was an impossible one, but that he would mention to me that it had been made. On the man’s calling again, after a visit to the Naqib’s house next door, the Dragoman informed him that I declined to receive visitors who came on errands such as his. Bearing in mind the suggestion! lately made by Mustafa Pasha to Mr. Soane, t See tat Summary, ni-2. 1?“ inclined' to think that both the Kur- dish chief and the Dujaili may have been sent for the purpose of discovering whether the British really cherish designs on Mesopotamia, as the Turks and Arabs always seem ready to believe. 7. The question of the nationality of Rajab ’AliJ has at last been settled by the V» ali’s admitting, at an interview + See last Summary Vi-6. which I had with him on the 1st July, that the man is a British subject. In this case I was able to produce the actual passport granted in India in 1850 to Rajab ’Ali’s grandfather and another. There are many British subjects in this country whose Indian descent is as indubitable as that of Rajab ’Ali, but in whose favour documentary proofs are not forthcom ing as they were, almost miraculously, in the present instance. The old passport, accepted by the \ ali in Rajab ’Ali’s case, covers a number of other descendants of the two deceased grantees. V.— Persian Affairs. 1. Some interesting papers relating to the Turco-Persian boundary dispute were sent by the Turkish Foreign Office to the Turkish Consulate at Lingah (Per sian Gulf), probably in forgetfulness of the fact that Turkish interests there are incharge of the British Vice-Consul. The documents were sent to me to be trans lated, and when this had been done the originals were returned with translations to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Particulars of the Turkish claim, as revealed in the papers, were telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. The Turkish claim includes nearly the whole of Lake Uru- miyah, the entire basin of its southern tributary the Jaghatu including the Afshar country, also Sinna and its dependencies. Local and consular officers of the I Turkish Government were instructed in the correspondence to work up evidence in favour of the claim,—though what a Turkish Consul at Lingah could have done in this respect, whose post is 400 miles from the nearest part of the disputed border, is not very apparent. The Persian Consul-General at Baghdad informed me lately that the work of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, which has been sitting for some time at Constantinople, did not appear to be making any progress. He thought that Persia would have to give up the attempt to deal with Turkey direct and fall back upon a Mixed Commission including British and Russian representatives. 2. My Persian colleague also informed me, on the 20th June, that he had about ten days previously, under instructions from his Government, induced the leading Mujtahids here to telegraph to the tribes in the neighbourhood of Isfahan and Shiraz enjoining them not to show hostility towards the British Government. As the Mukarram-us-Sultan thought that his instructions must be due to a request from some British authority, and as he seemed particularly anxious that the fact of his having taken action should be made known, I wired what he told me to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. 3. In a former report I mentioned a recent* influx of Persians into this country. * See last Summary, in. A number of these have since been ex pelled again by administrative order. On the evening of the 5th June 40 or 50 of them, some with their hands bound, were collected by the Turkish police from their lodgings at Kazimain for deportation to Persia via Khanaqin. The Persian Consul-General seems to have acquiesced in these proceedings on the Wali’s representation that the men were dangerous anti-Constitutionalists and that they might have a sinister influence on the local population, whose devotion to the Turkish Constitution was not yet fully develop ed. Nothing seems to have been said of how their return to Persia might affect the cause of Constitutionalism in their own country. '. The Persian Consul-General, when I saw him last, was much weighed down ( by the difficulties of his position. He said that every day produced some new game C‘ bazi ) on the part of the Turks, and that he never knew what form their next as sault on Persian interests would take. He mentioned that the Wali was now claiming all the Persians of Ba'qubah, Shahraban, and other places between Bagh dad and Khanaqin as Turkish subjects on an allegation that they had immigrated into Turkey during a famine in Persia with the intention of remaining, and that the only cause of their not having been hitherto registered as Ottoman subjects was the negligence of previous Walis. According to the Mukarram-us-Sultan these assertions are unproved and unproveable. VI.—Other Foreign Interests. 1. During the past month it became known locally that a site on the west side of the Tigris at Baghdad had been definitely selected for the terminus of the Aleppo-Baghdad Railway. Some land there had been acquired by the Railway Company through agents in anticipation of this decision, and what more is needed will be obtained by legal expropriation. The station and sidings will be some distance inland of a masonry ruin known as the “ Sinn ', which is a little above this Residency on the opposite side of the river. The Railway's port, which, it is understood, will become the general port of Baghdad, will have its entrance below the Residency on the further bank, and its head will be about on a level with the “ Sinn '. It is generally expected that the new Baghdad Customs House, the construction of which has been so long awaited, will be built by the agency of the Railway Company on the strip of land between the port and the river, that i? exactly opposite the Residency.This grouping together of railway station, port and Customs House in what will tend to become a German quarter, and perhaps the most important part of the town commercially, is not a favourable omen for British interests ; but, so far as can be seen, the arrangement is good and suitable from the Turkish and general point of view. The only defect is that the Customs House will be on the opposite side of the river from the present business quarter ; but a Customs House on the same side as the business quarter, if a proper site had been selected, would have been no less difficult of access. 2. The landing of iron materials and plant for the Baghdad Railway, brought (I believe) partly by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and partly by the Turkish Idarah Nahriyah in their own barges, is now in progress at a point immediately above the “ Sinn 3. Meissner Pasha stated some time ago that he would shortly visit Khana- qin with the principal Turkish Customs official at Baghdad to choose a site for the terminus of the Khanaqin branch of the Baghdad Railway. His expected journey has not yet taken place, however. Meissner Pasha's present intention is to carry the branch line up the western side of the Diyalah until the immediate vicinity of Khanaqin is reached, no doubt in order to avoid the necessity of building a bridge over the Alwand, which passes through Khanaqin, as well as over the Diyalah. He estimates that the construction of the branch can be completed in eight months time from first to last, doubtless on the assumption that a detailed survey and the necessary materials will be ready before the start is made. VII. —General and Miscellaneous. 1. The Indian papers show that Saiyid Ibrahim*, Naqibzada, received an extraordinary ovation at Bombay, princi- *See last Summary I -i. pally from Memons. The circumstance ex cites some amusement at Baghdad, where the Saiyid's home is, and where he might fairly be described as a nonentity. His uncle and father-in-law the Naqib is said to be much annoyed at the success of Saiyid Ibrahim's tour in India. Saiyid Ibrahim had already succeeded in attracting to himself an unduly large proportion of the Indian clientele of the family, and after this visit the receipts of its other members from Indian sources are likely to be still further reduced in his favour. Also it cannot have been agreeable to the Naqib to see his younger relation described in the Indian press as ‘‘the' Pir of Baghdad. 2. Saiyid Rashid Raza,f the alleged pan-Islamic propogandist, arrived at Baghdad on the 10th June and has been fSee last Summary iX-2. accommodated by the Naqib in a house near the shrine of ’Abdul Qadir. J. G. LORIMER, I.C.S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Brittanic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Baghdad, 6th July, 1912. ANNEXURE A. Copy of a letter dated 25th June 1912, to Shaikh Husain (Mazandarani), Karbala. Sir, You will remember that when I was at Karbala in the spring of 1910 you de clined, though you were then a distributor under the Oudh Bequest, to meet me and discuss with me the administration of the Bequest. Your share as a a distri butor was accordingly suspended by my order. I now learn from the Vice-Consul at Karbala, who has twice interviewed you on the subject, that you decline—both as regards the future and the past—to ac cept the principle laid down by the Government of India that each distributor shall be appointed and retained on condition of his distributing half his share througha Committee to f f deserving 'persons 33 . This, I may remark, is a very moderate con dition, for the will of the King of Oudh lays down that the whole of the money is to be distributed to deserving persons ; and from another point of view it is not in consistent with complete distribution, for both halves are distributed to deserving persons. I further understand from the Vice-Consul that you refuse to bind your self ever to attend the distributions personally or ever to send a representative to them. In these circumstances it is clear that you are not suitable to be a distributor of the charity, and I hereby inform you that your cessation to be such will have effect from 1910, when you declined to appear for the discussion of Bequest business. (Sd). J. G. LOKIMEB, LC.S.@ 1 ^ CrcxattoC _2,4. Iq/2, THE CARCHEMISH EXCAVATIONS. HITTITE DISCOVERIES. The excavations instituted last year by the ; British Museum at Carchemish were resumed during the past spring under the now direction of Mr. C. L. Woolley, assisted by Mr. T. E. ( LavTence, who took part in the first cam- . paign Mr. D. G. Hogarth, the original director, i paid a visit of inspection. Last season a finely built course of masonry was struck at the north end of the citadel mound at a depth of over 20ft., and two important Hittite monuments were found in the narrow trench—a column base supported by lions and an inscribed altar. Mr. Woolley spent the first two months of the past season in removing the overlying deposit from a large area on both sides of this trench in order to determine the nature and period of the build ing which evidently occupied this end of the citadel. It has proved to be a comparatively small fort of crude brick with well dressed facade of limestone and basalt. The occurrence of bricks stamped with the name of Sargon, the Assyrian conqueror of Carcheraish in 717 b.c., makes it probable that we have here the residence, of the Assyrian Governor of the newly-won province. It is ruined down to its basement structures, and so far as yet explored is almost completely denuded of its former contents. But the laborious clearance of it to foundation level, carried out by Mr. Woolley in a most patient and workmanlike manner, will bo of great service for future work, in that it now has provided a large area in which the lower Hittite levels . can be reached and has supplied a criterion of the upper stratification of the citadel The secret of the composition of the huge mound, which rises nearly 150ft. above the Euphrates, has been partially solved. It remains to explore it still deeper, down to (and even lower than) the stratum containing stone implements and painted pottery, which was tapped last season by headings driven into the flanks about 50ft. in perpendicular distance below the summit. The Riverside Quays. During the progress of this clearance on the citadel days of heavy north-west wind occurred, making work which necessarily raises a great deal of dust practically im possible in exposed situations. Driven to seek a field for excavation under the south-eastern flank of the great mound, Mr. Woolley has lighted on a sculptured approach to the riverside quays whose existence was suspected last season but not established. The reliefs which adorned this water-gate were executed in hard, fine-grained limestone, carved in the style of Cappadocian monuments. Nearly a dozen, whole or in fragments, have been recovered; and tho scenes represented, of animals in procession or of sacrifices, correspond very closely to those found on such a northern site as Eyuk—indeed, the most perfect, a scene of offerings being made to a throned goddess, might almost be by the hand which carved the balustrade leading to tho Palace of Eyuk. The original gateway, of which these sculptures formed a part, was the earliest Hittite monument at Carchemish of which any considerable remains have yet come to light, and can hardly be later than the 14th century b.c. It would seem, however, that at a later date it was taken down and rebuilt upon a different level, but for the most part with the same materials: tho original plan, which is also the plan of gateways upon other Hittite sites, was retained, though some what modified by tho intrusion of independent buildings ; many of the reliefs were set up again in their original places, but the gateway itself, and perhaps the approach leading from it to the “ Lower Palace,” were further decorated with new sculptures in basalt. The most im portant of these was a great lion, nearly 15ft. | m length, tho fragments of which were found at the foot of the old river bank. In marked contrast to tho re-us^“d limestone reliefs of the older gateway, this shows strong Meso potamian influence ; the style is conventionalized but vigorous, and the execution, though in so stubborn a material, is delicate and finished. On the lion s flank is a long hieroglyphic in scription carved in relief. The Lower Palace. I rom the water-gate a passage seems to have led to tho stairway and neighbouring buildings, which were found last season below the citadei and provisionally described as the Lower Palace. Here many reliefs had been found ; and the last third of tho season was devoted to preparing this important area for completer clearance. At tho foot of the stairway ex tended a large courtyard of irregular shape. Along the west side ran a wall, found in the first season, and decorated with reliefs of chariots and foot soldiers in the latest style of Hittite art ; to the south two large basalt reliefs had given hopes of further monuments to be found along the southern wall This season only a kttle work could be done here, the main object being to facilitate the laying of a construction rail-way for the removal of the vast amount of debris which covers this lower part of the site, crossed as it is by heavy Roman foundations and buried beneath some 15ft. of stone and earth. However, a short length of the southern wall was laid bare, and here were disclosed five new limestone rehefs of very great interest. One of these shows an archer* mounted upon a camel; the treatment of the animal (which here makes its first appearance in Hittite art) is highly naturalistic and contrasts curiously with tho formal arrangement of the next scenes. In these two deities, one apparently the thunder ged and one having the body of a scorpion, eagle’s wings, and bull’s feet, are clubbing to death a winged bull; two men hold the hands of a captive who crouches between them, and plunge their daggers into his head ; two sphinxes stand in heraldic fashion on either side of a winged horse; two bulls, strongly stylized in Mesopotamian fashion, charge head to head. These reliefs stand in position along tin wall, and give every promise of further similar discoveries when work can be continued in this part of the field. Other Findsj It is clear that Sargon’s capture of the city in 717 b.c. was marked by wanton destruction of its monuments. In many places the pave ment of the courtyard is piled high with frag ments of reliefs and inscriptions thrown down from the Palace, which lay upon the sloping ground to the east, broken to pieces and scat tered broadcast. This season alone, compara tively small as was the area cleared, produced over a thousand such fragments of carved or inscribed basalt. Among these was a great quadrangular block, the base of a relief, in scribed on two sides with one of the longest and certainly the most admirably carved Hittite hieroglyph inscriptions so far known. Several fragments were found of a scene, carved in three-quarter relief, of two deities or royal persons seated beneath an elaborate canopy ; the figures are considerably less than life size, but tne workmanship is of astonishing excel lence ; the delicate modelling of the flash and the intricate detail of the drapery and orna ments recall the best Egyptian sculpture of the 18th dynasty. Besides these, fragments of lions and bulls and of numerous inscribed stelce showed how rich had been the decoration of the Palace ; but more promising still, per haps, was the discovery of part of a large clay cylinder inscribed with Hittite hieroglyphs, j The interior of the Lower Palace yet awaits excavation, and though it is sadly ruined it may well contain more complete documents of a sort which has not occurred upon other Hittite sites. Minor Antiquities. A great advance has been made this year I in the knowledge of Hittite pottery and minor i antiquities. A good deal of information about /organised by companies not by battalions. The Frontier Companies system was inaugurated in 1910 in European Turkey and Anatolia, and in 1911 twenty Frontier Companies allotted to the 3rd Military Inspectorate-General were formed ; only now is it being extended to the 4th Inspectorate-General (Musal Army Corps and Baghdad Army Corps). His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal heard, about the middle of May, that some 2,000 Kurds of the Jaf, Hama wand and Dizzai tribes had joined the new force. If this report referred to the Musal Army Corps alone, I should be inclined to doubt its correctness, because (i) the strength attained by the enlist ment of these Kurds alone would be equal to that of the Frontier Companies in the three Army Corps of the 3rd Inspectorate-General (Erzerum, Erzinjan, Van) and (ii) the rate of progress at Musal would be rapid out of all proportion to what it seems to be at Baghdad. 2. As regards Cadre Units,* I now learn from Major Tyrrell that the ^ . tti i tt i explanation of the confusion regarding * See Summary for February II-l. ,, r . r n t these bodies appears to be as follows. In the recent new organisation of the Turkish Army it was at first intended that each regiment should consist of two full battalions of 4 companies each and a cadre or skeleton battalion of one company. Now it has been resolved to expand the cadre battalions of the regiments into full batta lions ; but each full battalion is to consist of three full companies and a fourth cadre company, instead of four full companies. This, it will be seen, amounts to the addition of one full company per regiment, simultaneously with the sub stitution of three cadre companies —whatever these may be — for one cadre battalion of one company. In the 13th Army Corps, where there is a great shortage of men, this means a rearrangement only, not an increase, of the effect ive strength. The new dispositions have already been made in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Inspectorates-General. 3. It is almost impossible to follow the movements of the small Turkish detachments upon the Persian frontier. According to the best information I can get, the cavalry at Khanaqin towards the end of April were : 2nd squadron (62 sabres) and 4th squadron (65 sabres) of the 31st Cavalry Regiment, also 20 sabres from some squadron of the same or another regiment, and some mounted gendarmes. If this is correct some changes have been made since the end of „ „ « . , A Februaryt. The details mentioned pro- bably composed the small mounted column which Mr. Soane met near Khanaqin on 13th April, and which a few days later, according to my information, returned to Khanaqin, as the Wali had said that it would. At the end of April small detachments from the 32nd Cavalry Regiment were moving about the country in the neighbourhood of Hillah. 4. It will be remembered^ that at the end of April a small force left Baghdad „ TT , Q for Hillah. I now learn that the cause of its despatch was a conflict between Arabs of the B’aij tribe and a detachment of the 32nd Cavalry, which last was accompanied by the Qaim-Maqam of Hillah. The fighting is said to have gone on for five hours, and the troops seem to have had the worst of the encounter. A private letter from Hillah states that there were 120 of the 32nd Cavalry and some gendarmerie at Hillah before the arrival of the Baghdad column. There are rumours that the combined force has since been engaged with the Zubaid Arabs, but nothing definite is ascertainable as yet. 5. The Turkish authorities seem to be still playing with some project for increasing the defensibility of the Fao § See last Summary II-7. Fort§. On the 14th May the Walis of Baghdad and Basrah and the Turkish Commodore at Basrah went to Fao in the “ Marmaris ”, inspected the Fort, and returned to Basrah on the following day. It is said that the Wali of Basrah has urged that the strength of the Fao garrison should be raised to 150 men.6. Towards the end of April orders seem to have been received at Baghdad that “ the 4th and 5th Artillery ” should proceed to Musal and “ the 6th ” to Kirkuk. I understand these numbers to refer to sections or batteries of mountain artillery. On the 27th of May 4 mountain guns with 20 artillery men, 3 of whom were Armenians, left Baghdad “ for Tuz-Khurmatu ”, a place on the road to Kirkuk as well as to Musal, and one at which their travelling escort might very naturallv be relieved by one from Kirkuk. It will be interesting to see whether any more guns follow these, and whether, if they do, any mountain artillery at all is in evidence at the next military review at Baghdad. Possibly all the mountain artillery at Baghdad is being handed over to the 12th Army Corps in expectation, or on account, of the arrival here of new guns from Europe. 7. The process of rearming the Radif'continues. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Musal reported at the middle of May that 1,840 Mausers and 52,000 rounds of ammunition had been sent to Rowanduz for the Radif there or thereabouts. On the 21st May I was informed that a contract had been given by the mili tary authorities at Baghdad for the transport of 500 boxes of ammunition to Musal; but there was nothing to show whether this ammunition was for the Radif or for the Nizam. 8. Shamil Pasha* has been retired on pension. It seems that he drew his revolver on the Commander of the Musal Army Corps, or made as if to do so. * See last Summary II-2. 9. For over a month there have been more than 100 military officers collected in the Baghdad fortified Camp, where they are undergoing a special course of in struction. The instructors are officers on the Staff at Baghdad. The officers forming the instruction classes are of all ranks from Lieutenant-Colonels down wards, and they are drawn from the 12th Army Corps as well as from the 13th. They work five days in the week and are given leave on Thursdays and Fridays, when they flock into Baghdad. More field exercisesf or manoeuvres on a small scale have been held in the vici nity of Baghdad. t See last Summary II-9. J 6 ’Ali Riza Pasha, the present Inspector-General of the 4th Inspection District +See last Summary II- 10. . and Commander of the 12th Army Corps, who is, I think, responsible for these develop ments, seems to be a man of considerable initiative as well as good sensef. 10. Lieutenant-Colonel ’All Bey lately commanding an Infantry battalion here, and Colonel Javad Bey on the staff of the Baghdad Radif Division, formerly Nazim Pasha s consulting engineer in municipal matters, have left for Constanti nople. Both belong to the class ofjthe “ modern ” officer in Turkey, and it is wonder ed whether their being simultaneously ordered to Constantinople has any special significance. If Italy is going to force the pace in places outside Africa, there will no doubt be an increased demand at the capital for Turkish military intellect. H. A fire broke out in the Military Factory (’Abakhanah) at Baghdad on the morning of the 31st May. It originated in the wool store, but whether it was accidental or incendiary is not known ; the Factory was closed for Friday The wool store and a long line of buildings containing most of the older weaving machi- § See last Summary ii- 10 . nery were destroyed.

The Wall left Baghdad on the 1st of May for a tour along part of the Persian frontier and to Basrah. His first halt was at Ba’qubah, and he remained there until the 3rd, when he moved to Balad Ruz. He was the guest at Balad Ruz of a European agricultural expert in the service of the proprietor of the village, M. Zarifi, until the night of the 5th. He arrived on the morning of the 6th at Mandah and spent the day there, leaving the same evening for Badrah. His movements thereafter until the 9th, when he reached Kut on the Tigris and took steamer for Basrah, are uncertain. On arrival at Mandali the Wall addressed a gathering of the inhabitants urging them, as their lands were valuable, to lay aside mutual ^enmities and devote themselves to agriculture, so that they might not be enslaved by foreigners.” He said that his object in coming to Mandali was to inspect the vari ous civil departments ; and he apparently did so afterwards, with unsatisfactory results He also recommended education as a means of escaping the dangei or foreign domination. In an interview which he accorded to some Shaikhs he asked about their cattle and impressed upon them also the necessity for unity and for being on their guard against foreigners. (The only foreigner with interests m that part is the Greek, M. Zarifi, on whose estate the Mali had been staging). At ’Amarah the steamer on which the Wali of Baghdad travelled was joined* * See next paragraph. ' by the Wali of Basrah. The Wali of Baghdad spent about a week at Basrah, during which, as already mentioned, he inspected the Fao Fort. On the 15th of May he seems to have made one of the strong speeches for which he is famous at the Club of the Committee of Union and Progress, and to have said that the Committee of the Liberal Entente was a danger to the country, that its members should be punished 4 “ not with whips but with iron clubs ”, and that he hoped they would shortly be so punished. On the same day he dined with Abdul Wahhab, Qartas, one of the recently elected Union and Progress members of Parliament for Basrah. On the evening of the 16th May, after an excursion to Zubair, he left by steamer for Baghdad, abandoning a tour which he had planned to make by land through the Muntafik country. At Basrah, however, he had already received and conferred with the Mutasarrif of the Muntafik Sanjaq. The Wali returned to Baghdad on the 20th or 21st May. 13. The Wali of Basrah left Basrah on the 6th of May, having ostensibly re signed his appointment there. His resignation was attributed by himself to the failure of the judicial authorities to respect a safe-conduct which he had granted to one of the adherents of the rebelj* ’Ab- t See Summary for February 1-4. „ dul Karim-bin-Saihud. Subsequently a +See Summary or anuary . telegram was received at Basrah from the Minister of the Interior which stated that the Walks recommendation that the re bels ’Abdul Karim (A1 Bu Muhammad) and Ghadhbani (Bani Lam) and certain of their adherents should be pardoned had been provisionally granted, and that in the meanwhile no legal action would be taken against them. The adherent of ’Abdul Karim'who had been arrested was then released ; and the Wali, who had gone to ’Amarah to await the final orders of his Government, returned to Basrah. The above account of the difference, which seems to be accepted by His Bri tannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, is no doubt the correct one ; but my Russian colleague professes to know that the Wali was dismissed for having failed to ma nage the Basrah parliamentary elections to the satisfaction of the Union and Pro gress party and was afterwards reinstated through powerful influence which he brought to bear. 14. One result of the passing of a new Civil Government Law for the whole of Turkey is understood to be the elimination of the Naqibs of Wilayats, where such exist, from the Wilayat Administrative Council, which in future willconsist of paid officials only. This measure is a particularly severe blow to the pres tige of the Naqib of Baghdad who has hitherto enjoyed a great quasi-official posi tion ; but it is not so invidious as it would have been if its scope had been less general. 15. All the members of the Baghdad Municipal Committee have resigned, it is understood as a protest against the view of the Wali, who very properly insists that they should at once compensate the depositors of oil who have suffered by the fire* of 11th May in the municipal oil * See viii-4, below. depot. The Committee, it 'seems, would prefer to procrastinate or, possibly to deny their liability and trust to the delays and uncertainties of the law. It is also stated that the Wall’s desire to spend £T.1,000 from municipal funds on a “ hippodrome ” was a cause of difficulty between him and the late Committee. The Assistant Wall is acting temporarily as President of the Baghdad Munici pal Committee, and a new Committee is to be formed. The Wali appears to be officially advocating a change whereby the members of the Committee would in future be nominated by the civil authority instead of being elected by the popular vote. 16. Sevian Beyf, the manager of the Idarah Nahriyah or line of Turkish river steamers, has now returned to Baghdad after t See Summary for September 1911, H-6. two long absences at Basrah. He says that f Basrah is the natural headquarters of the management of the line, and that their location at Baghdad, which is due to purely official considerations, is inconvenient and unpractical. Sevian Bey is now convinced that the Turkish line can never be profitably or successfully run as a Government department, there being too much interference with the manager, especially from Constantinople, and too little scope being allowed him in regard to the punishment, dismissal, etc., of employes. Sevian Bey’s recommendation is that the steamers, premises and plant of the Idarah Nahri- vah should be let out by the Government to a Company at a monthly rate. The Company should be formed at Constantinople, and the local magnates of Baghdad, who all have private interests to serve, should not be allowed to have much in fluence in it. If the payments were monthly, Sevian Bey considers £T. 5,000 ■would be a sufficient capital for the Company to begin on. It appeared to me, from a conversation which he had with me on the subject, that Sevian Bey had been in correspondence with financial friends at the capital, and that he was himself ready to become the manager of the new commercial com pany under conditions assuring him greater liberty of action than he at present possesses. 17. It does not appear that the Turkish motor J boats on the upper Euphrates have succeeded in making a single voyage + See last Summary H-20. towards Aleppo as yet, and the period of subsidence of the floods is already at hand. Mr. de Genouillac, after waiting some time at Fallujah for a boat, was obliged to obtain a carriage from Baghdad to Aleppo instead. The amateur mechanician has returned to Baghdad. Altogether there are now two good Thornycroft motor boats lying idle on the Euphrates and two large and very fine ones by Yarrow rusting at anchor on the Tigris. Political and General. 18. In the Basrah Wilayat the parliamentary elections at ’Amarah have re sulted in the success of two, and those in the Muntafik country of three, so called Union and Progress candidates. The Musal elections were still unfinished at the middle of May, and there was talk of official pressure and even intimidation being exercised in favour of the Union and Progress Committee’s nominees. The following extract from one of Mr. Hony’s despatches is instructive as showing how political principles are understood here “ Baud Yussefani, the late Roman Catholic Deputy for Musal, seeing the turn of affairs, telegraphed through the Chaldaean Patriarch to the Committee at Constantinople, asking to be ad nutted as their candidate; as he has always been a prominent opponent the Committee of Union and Progress naturally refused. Thereupon Yussefani and the Pat.ia ch went to the French C233FDVice-Consul and endeavoured to persuade him to telegraph to his Embassy to urge the Com mittee of Union and Progress to reverse their decision, pointing out the necessity to French in terests of having a Roman Catholic Deputy.” 19. The progressive Qadhi * of Diwaniyeh, Hasan Salih, visited me lately at * See last Summary Ml. Baghdad. To my surprise I found him to be a Free Mason, though but slightly in structed ; and his having heard that I was a Mason now appeared to be the real cause of his visits to me here and at Hillah. He told me that his initiation dated from 1910, when Colonel Hasan Riza Bey, Nazim Pasha’s Chief of the Staff was trying to found a lodge | in this country and the co-operation of the British Consul- t See Summary for August 1910, V-26. j JeneI ' al ^P^ted. Nothing had come. however, of those schemes. The Qadhi told me that he was going to Constantinople shortly, and he asked for an introduction to the British Embassy there, but I did not give him one. 20. The following is an extract from a translation of a letter, dated Constanti nople, 16th January 1912, from ’Abdul Wahhab, Qartas, to the Editor of the “ Za- mindar,” Lahore, published in that paper on the 6th March last. The writer, it should be mentioned, belongs to the Committee of Union and Progress party and has lately t See IX -2 below. been re-elected parliamentary Deputy for Basrah; while the tone of the “ Zamindar ’’J is, I understand, pan-Islamic. “ I think it would not be out of place here to mention some of the reports I gave to the House since I was elected as a Deputy. My reports can be divided into two parts :—(1) Reports on the the improvements that ought to be introduced in Mesopotamia, Nejd and the Ottoman terri tory of the Persian Gulf, (2) reports on the duties of the Ottoman Government towards its Indian co-religionists. In this latter I asked the Government among things (1) to abolish the duty laid on the Indian pilgrims, (2) to appoint in both Jiddah and Makkah special employes who under stand the Urdu language to help the Indian pilgrims and prevent the ill-treatment to which they might be subjected by porters, camel drivers and others, (3) to open new consulates at Lahore, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, Karachi and Allahabad, and to see that Consuls appointed there and in all the other parts of the Islamic word are religious and able people who will represent the Ottoman Government and not misuse its name, (4) to build a mosque in Bombay in the name of the Otto man Khalifate, (5) to give orders and decorations as a reward to those who subscribe to the Otto man Fleet and Red Crescent Societies, and (6) lastly to start a newspaper in the Urdu language here in Constantinople or in Bombay under the editorship of the Consul, aided by our Indian co-religionists and thus to furnish the Muslim readers in India with the correct news of the Ottoman Eempire. As for the Turkish papers you ask, I think that Tanin and Sabah are the best that will suit you. I shall give the Directors of these papers the address of the Zamindar and tell them to send their papers in exchange for yours, as is usually done everywhere. “ You ask too the name of a, telegraph agency which will furnish you daily with the news of the War. I shall speak to the Directors of these agencies and will give you an answer in a follow ing letter, but I wish you to take this point into consideration that they would possibly charge high rates. It might, therefore, be cheaper to get the news direct from the British agencies.” “ Before finishing up, I wish to express my sympathies with the BriTsh Government and I heartily hope that the two Governments of turkey and England will be able to undersand each other. And will you kindly write &lt; o me in triplicate the names of the gentlemen who deserve orders and decorations as a reward for the sympathies they showed towards the Ottoman Government. I shall also be thankful if you will let me know the particulars of what has been paid or done. Promising to write to you from time to time letters which I permit you with pleasure to publish in the Zamindar, I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, Abdool Wahab bin Kurtas.” The Government of India will no doubt keep a watch on the various schemes here described, and also on the correspondence with which the Turkish Deputy promises to entertain the readers of the “ Zamindar ”. 21. It is to be hoped that news of the war from the Turkish side which the Zamindar may circulate in India will be less flagrantly false than that supplied to subscribers at Baghdad by the “ Agence Ottomane ”. Their telegrams report fresh victories of the Turco-Arab forces in Tripoli almost every day and some times two or three are announced in one day, at Benghazi, Derna, Bu Qamis, etc. The Italians are always beaten back to their fortifications with ignominy and heavy loss, while the defenders of the country hardly suffer at all. If half of whatW), v* 7 is said in the Agency telegrams were true, the Italians would long since have been driven out of Tripoli. These incessant misrepresentations may make most Euro peans smile ; but a German gentleman long domiciled at Baghdad, who knows I the place very well and is in touch with all sorts of people, tells me that thev are believed by Muhammadan readers and that a very aggressive spirit towards all Europeans is begining to manifest itself in the town. I have not myself seen any signs of it. J 22. In stating some time since that the crescentading spirit* appeared to be * See last Summary III-4. dead I should have explained, perhaps, that I did not mean to question the existence of strong political sympathy between Muhammadans of all countries. But the spirit of combination among Muhammadans at large is now defensive, not aggressive. Their aim seems to be to preserve the [remaining Muhammadan countries in statu quo, or at most to recover ground lost in recent times, not to bring Christen dom or any part of it under the yoke of Islam. Moreover the principle of their solidarity, in consequence of the unacknowledged but real spread of free thought and secular ideas among the Muhammadan public, seems to be now much more political than religious. The best antidote to pan-Islamism is evidently the fair treatment of Muhammadan Powers by Christian Powers, for already there is little or no feeling on the part of enlightened Muhammadans against tha Christian powers, such as Britain and Germany, which are believed to regard the present war with real impartiality. I would remark again on the scantiness of the practical, that is of the military, response on the part of the Muhammadan world to the demands of the present situation : it is due no doubt to want of organization, to distance, to differences of language and of race, and to general hopelessness, as well as to the absence of strong enthusiasm. The liberal subscriptions of Indian Muhammadans and others to the funds of the Turkish Red Crescent Society are not only harmless but commendable, and are an important symptom of the chang ing spirit of the age. « III. Persian Affairs. 1. The Salar-ud-Daulah left Gilan, f which is in the Kalhur country, about f See last Summary iii-i. the 28th or 29th of April. His object in going to that place seems to have been to obtain the support of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. The Wali apparently hesitated about meeting him, but was at last induced to go to Gilan by a safe conduct received from the Prince in the shape of a sealed Quran. While at Gilan the Wali lived in his own tents and fed himself and his men, refusing to be the guest of Dawud Khan (Kalhur) who, he said, was a robber and could only entertain him from his unlawful spoils. The Prince and the W T ali spent several days together, during which the latter seems to have maintained firmly that he could only assist the Royalists upon certain con ditions. These were that all the chiefs in the Royalist army should support their followers honestly, without robbery or pillage, afterwards deducting the amount of the pay given from the tribute due by the chiefs to the Shah’s government; that in the course of the expedition travellers and traders should be unmolested ; and that extortion from merchants and others should not be practised. The Wali’s condi tions are said to have been formally conceded ; but he apparently put no faith in the assurances and returned to his own place. He has not since moved in the interests of the Salar-ud-Daulah. The Salar at Gilan'married a daughter of Dawud Khan (Kalhur), the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh being present at the wedding. This is said to be the tenth matrimonial alliance contracted by the Prince during his present campaign. From Gilan the Salar-ud-Daulah seems to have hurried back to Kirmanshah to meet the threatened advance of a Government force under the Farman-Farma from Hamadan. The townsmen of Kirmanshah were now wavering in their alle giance to the Salar and pressing him for a declaration of his intentions, and in reply to them he stated that he would immediately advance against the enemy. He had already summoned ’Ali Akbar Khan, son of Samsam-ul-Mamalik, chief of theSinjabi Kurds to join him at Gilan; but that leader on account of a feud between himself and Dawud Khan, had neglected to do so. The Farman-Farma, who had been at Hamadan since the 22nd April, marched out from there on the 3rd or 5th of May and gained a partial success. Two days later the Salar gave the Farman-Farma battle and defeated his division. The rebels captured 3 or 4 guns, but their victory cost them dear in killed and wounded. The Farman-Farma was extricated by the Amir-i-Nizam with another division and withdrew to a village about 20 miles from Hamadan. Meanwhile Goverr.ment forces under other leaders were hastening to the scene of action from different directions. On the 19th May a fresh collision took place between the opposing armies and the rebels were this time totally defeated, losing, it is said, 300 killed, 200 prisoners, and many wounded. The Salar fell back on Kurbeh, a long way on the Kirman- shah side of Hamadan, having been deserted by most if not all of his Sinjabi and Juwanrudi Jaf Kurds, whom tribal fighting had recalled to their homes. On the Government side a leader named Dr. Sohrab Khan was killed in leading a charge against some Dashti entrenchments ; and Reuter's telegrams received at Baghdad mention the death of the celebrated Yeprim, possibly in a later engagement, for no news of this event has reached Baghdad from any other source. According to native news the Salar-ud-Daulah had returned to Kirmanshah by the 23rd May; he was said to be in desperate straits. By the 28th May the Mujallal-us-Sultan* had come to his aid at Kirmanshah, but brought with him only 100 bandits ; * See last Summary wag understood that the Kurds of the Sinnah side declined to follow his leadership. Meanwhile Dawud Khan (Kalhur) who had hitherto been detained in his own country by tribal dangers, but who could no longer refuse to respond to the summons of the Salar-ud-Daulah, passed Kirmanshah on his way to the front. He had less than 1,000 men with him, and his orders were understood to be to hold Bisaitun on the Kirmanshah- Hamadan road. By this time the Government forces were said to have occupied Kangavar. The Salar's last defeat was no doubt due in part to inter-tribal quarrels in his rear, which drew off the attention of the Kurds composing most of his army, and which eventually caused a number of his best fighting men to abandon him at the critical moment. At the end of April there was a combination against Dawud Khan (Kalhur) between the Sinjabi and the Guran (Kurds), headed by 'Ali Akbar Khan (Sinja bi) ; but hostilities were in this case postponed until the fate of the Salar-ud- Daulah, whom all these tribes apparently supported, had been decided. About the middle of May the Bajlan Kurds round Chiah Surkh, near Qasr-i- Shirin, where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have works, were attacked by Nasr-ud-Din of the Talabanah, a refugee from Turkish territory. The Bajlan were expelled from their seats, and the country round Chiah Surkh became deserted. The reason of this attack is not explained. Many Muradi Jaf Kurds from the Turkish side of the line took part in the fighting against the Bajlan, apparently in violation of orders from their Government. Muleteers arriving at Baghdad towards the end of May reported the country about Sar-i-Pul, above Qasr-i-Shirin, to be swarming when they passed with Talabanah, Hamawand and Zanganah ; but it is not clear whether these hordes had come to engage in tribal warfare, or to take port in the struggle between the Salar-ud-Daulah and the Farman-Farma. If I am not mistaken the Talabanah and the Hamawand are practically all Turkish subjects. At the end of May the Guran Kurds were at Zohab, about 20 miles east of Qasr-i-Shirin, opposing the further advance of the conquerors of the Bajlan, and 'Ali Akbar Khan (Sinjabi) had gone to join them. A more confused situation than exists in the Kirmanshah and Qasr-i-Shirin districts of Persia can hardly be imagined, where the zones of a civil war and a tribal struggle, apparently unconnected with each other, threaten shortly to coincide.-b* 1 4. It does not appear that the Wali of Baghdad can have had much opportu- / nity, during his tour* near the Persian * See n, above. frontier, of influencing events in Persia. By the time he reached Mandali the Salar-ud-Daulah had been gone from Gilan about a week, and the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh probably longer. But the Turkish Wali seems to have made use, or tried to make use, of Mustafa Pasha, the Bajlan Kurdish chief of Khanaqin, as an emissary in some trans-frontier business. According to my information this chief’s services were required to open communication upon some unknown subject with the Wali of Pusht-i- Kuh ; while the British Vice-Consul, Qasr-i-Shirin, heard that it was desired by his means to settle the case of one “ Khurshid Beg Dilo (Turkish subject) of Khan Masi, in Baghchah, who has retired to Persian territory with 40 Savars, owing the Turkish Government about £ T.350.” This might be the outlaw Muhammad Khurshid of the Dawudiyah tribe, who was the cause of difficul- tiesf between Nazim Pasha and the Muta- t See Summary for November 1910, l-l. sarrif of Kirkuk two years ago, were it not that it has been hitherto understood that the political superintendence of the present Wali of Baghdad is limited to the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats and their frontiers. I have it from a good source that Mustafa Bey passed through Ba’qubah a day before the Wali arrived and engaged a carriage for Khanaqin, telling a friend that he was to pick up an escort of ten mounted men there. With these he said he was to rejoin the Wali at Mandali; from Mandali he was to accompanv the Wali to Badrah ; and from Badrah he was to proceed to Pusht-i- Kuh. A few days later the British Vice-Consul at Qasr-i-Shirin reported that there was much talk in his district of the probability of Mustafa Pasha being appointed Qaim-Maqam, on the part of the Turks, of Zohab in Persia to the east of Qasr-i-Shirin. The Vice-Consul reports, under date 21st May, the following curious inci dent which took place after Mustafa Pasha’s return from his trip with the Wall. I quote Mr. Soane’s own words from the letter which he wrote to me “On his return from Mandali * * * * Mustafa Pasha sent a verbal message to me, asking me to send over a confidential man, as he had a message of importance to communicate which he did not care to put on paper, and the messenger returned with an extraordinary story. It appears that Mustafa Pasha, who is pretty independent and resents anv inteference from the Turks, had quite a lively time with the Wali, and came in for some abuse, and returning with his temper upon him, desired me to communicate the following to you. That he, with the populations on the frontier, as far north as Qaradagh, and including Salahia and Kifri, desired to be taken as British subjects, and that if you consented to such a step he would come to Baghdad, take refuge in the Residency, hand over his properties in the Khanaqin district to the British, and declare himself and certain friends British sub jects. “ The day after I received this message, to which I sent no reply, I had occasion to go over to Khanaqin, and assured him that such a request from his part was absolutely out of the question, however it might be regarded, and that it would be far better that he refrained from requesting me to pass on any such message, as I could him tell him the reply to it, without it going anv further. Nothing would satisfy him, however, but that I communi cate with you on the subject, and recommend his suggestion, which I flatly refused to do, verv naturally, and I finally left him without even promising to inform you of the affair, although he continued to press very hard. He professed not to be able to credit my assertion that the even momentary consideration of such a proposition was absolutely out of the question. Although it did occur to me that perhaps the Wali had put him to it, in order to see what would be said, I subsequently dismissed the idea, as I heard from several other sources that his in terview had been a very stormy one, and that he had abused the \Y ali before other people, which is credible, as he is very hot-tempered. Mr. Soane was told that the original cause of the quarrel between Mustafa Pasha and the Wali was that the latter had upbraided the former for being friendlv with him (the British Vice-Consul at Qasr-i-Shmn), and had said that he also suspected him (Mustafa Pasha) of intriguing with the Salar-ud-Daulah. When it is remembered that Mustafa Pasha left Baghdad as the Wall s own emis sary on political business, this explanation cannot be considered probable. Mustafa C233FDPasha’s indignation may have been feigned ; or, if it were real, it may have been due to some difficulty about the negotiations with which he was entrusted, or possibly to the participation of Turkish subjects in the attack upon his own tribe, the Bajlan, in Persian territory. Overtures fox British protection here are too frequent and too insincere to deserve serious mention. Two other such were reported* by me not long _ , , ago. In any case I do not know what •See last Summary III-8 and 9. ^ right Mustafa Pasha had to Speak for the people of Salahiyah (Kifri;, who are not Bajlan and who are under Mahmud Pasha, the chief of the Jaf.

On his return from his x See last Summary i-4. own ^untry whither he lately wentj, he , , , . . crossed the Wall on tour at Ba’qubah and had an interview with him there, probably on the 2nd May. The Wali ordered him to go to Baghdad and awe it his return there, as he had business to discuss with him. Since his arrival at Baghdad Mahmud Pasha has been living as a guest in the house of Muhammad Pasha (Daghistani), ez-Mushir and ex- u a ver I 7 P lc ^ u . resc l ue old-fashioned character and a very loyal Ottoman, though y birth a Circassian. I was lately introduced to Mahmud Pasha at some mount- ed sports at Baghdad ; I had met his son Kaikhusrau Beg at Qizilrobat in 1910, • an . ae a fforwards, I think, called upon me here. Mahmud Pasha seemed very anxious to be friends, but the presence of a Turkish officer seemed to make him uncomfortable, and he insisted in talking Turkish though I addressed him in Persian. He wears spectacles and does not look much like the paramount chief or a great semi-civilised tribe. 4. The British \ice-Consul at Qasrd-Shirin informs me that he has heard * 0I i i ree sources khe occupation by the Turks of the village and district ot Khuluzah, between Baneh and Merivan. I am not sure whether it is to be § See last Summary ni-ii. understood from this that former § state- r • •, ments as to the Turkish occupation of Men van itself are now to be held as incorrect. 5. It is reported that Amin Bey, a new Turkish Consul appointed substantive- 11 See Summary for February ni-e. ly to Kirmanshah,|| left Baghdad to join his post on the 5th May. 6. The mails which left Kirmanshah for Baghdad on the 16th April were plundered on the way, in Persian territory. A letter sent me in this post by His n anmc Majesty s Consul at Kirmanshah w r as not delivered. The offenders are said to have been ordinary robbers, but it is considered more probable that they were some of the Salar-ud-Daulah’s people. at ^ s 1 1 Y a ^ (S a dr), one of the two last remaining members of the late Mujtahid Assembly at Kazimain, and probably the most important of them all, icturned to his home at Karbala towards the end of April. a xr ^ f G ^ ers ^ an Consul-General at Baghdad started upon a tour to Karbala an . a J a a ie of April, and he did not return to headquarters till about the middle of May. The object of his journey has not transpired. 9. There is said to be a considerable immigration of Persians into this country a the present time. Many of the immigrants are settling at Karbala and Najaf; an some, it is said, mean to go to Constantinople, but I should think that those who really do will be very few. &lt;&lt; tti ^ J? esid ?? cy S e ?°nd Dragoman attended a distribution of prizes at the mwvat or Fraternity School, a Persian institution, at Kazimain on the11 24th of May The ceremony was held m a garden belonging to one Alioff, a Russian subject, on the outskirts of the town. Large photographs of the Sultan and the Shah were displayed, and a Turkish military band was in attendance. The Persian Consul-General was nominal president on the occasion, but he did not occupy the chair, and all the honours of the day were paid to Muhammad Pasha* (Daghis- * See ni-3, above tani), who was present, as were also nume- , rous Tur kish officers and officials, including the Commandant of the 13th (Baghdad) Army Corps, the Qaim-Maqam of Kazi- main, and others. • Mr. ’Abdur Rabb reports :— “ The boys recited political poetries on the subject of the excesses of Italy in Tripoli and of the Russians and English in Persia, ending with prayers for the well-being of the two Islamic countries, their union in particular, and unity of Muhammadans of the world in general. It looked very comic to see boys of 6 or 7 years old enlarging in set speeches on the doings of Italy in Iripoli, and tyrannies of Russia and intrigues of England in Persia, etc , etc. f At the end the Persian Consul-General delivered a short speech in Turkish, showing the benefits of education by comparing the East with the West as regards prosperity, dominance and civilisation of Europe, (but) abstaining scrupulously from hinting at political questions of any sort. ” IV.—Central Arabia and Kuwait Affairs. 1. A report by the British Political Agent at Kuwait confirms the alleged t See last Summary, IV-3. defeat *j* of the Dhafir by the Amir of Uail» and adds that Ibn Rashid appears to have been acting in the interests of the Muntafik rather than in his own. The Dawish section of the Mutair, as well as the Muntafik generally, appear to have been on his side; and he is said now to have returned to his own country. 2. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah mentions, under date of 13th May, that a monthly salary of 300 piastres has been allotted in the budget of the Basrah Wilayat for the salary of a clerk of the Tapu or Turkish Land Records Department at Kuwait. The actual appointment of any such official to Kuwait would, it is presumed, constitute a flagrant violation of the local status quo on the part of the Turkish authorities. 3. On the 16th April the Shaikh of Kuwait was invested by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief in India with the insignia of the K.C.I.E., which was conferred upon him on the occasion of the Delhi Coronation Durbar. There was the usual crop of sensational rumours at Baghdad in consequence. V.—British Cases and Interests. L It recently came to my notice that the policeman and gendarme sentenced t See last Summary, V-i. months’ imprisonment for maltreat ing J the British subject Saiyid Muhammad have not yet been confined, though judgement was passed upon them by the Tur kish Court last November. I have been assured by the Assistant Wali that the reason for this is that they have appealed, and that notice will be given to this Consulate-General when the appeal is beard. It will be necessary to keep a watch on the case, however, lest through an oversight the sentence should remain a dead letter. 2. The Wali informed me, towards the end of May, that Messrs. Lynch had p „ „ again been authorised to tow a second § See last Summary, V-3. i e •, i ,i • , ,-i ^ barge § with their steamers until an accu mulation of 3,800 tons of cargo at Basrah has been cleared off. It seems to me that there is perhaps, locally, what would be called in legal parlance, a failure to agree upon the same conditions in the same sense. It is not clear at Baghdad whether “ accumulation ” means a general balance of untransported goods or certain specific goods which were lying at Basrah on a particular date, nor whether “ clear ed ofi ” means cleared off by the extra barge or cleared off by any means whatever. £ JMEach party here probably holds the view more favourable to itself and will regard, or profess to regard, the other as guilty of bad faith if it presses the opposite one. 3. Ezra Effendi * has been to visit me. His Indian tour has evidently made a deep impression on his mind. He is * See last Summary, V-5. greatly struck with the almost absolute similarity of agricultural conditions in the Punjab and Mesopotamia, and with the contrast between the teeming prosperity of the one province and the sterile un- progressiveness of the other ; but he .is not without hope for the future of this country. I showed him some large scale irrigation plans of the Lower Chenab Canal system, which had been supplied to me from India, in which he was much interested ; and I afterwards lent the same plans to Mr. Whitley, Sir John Jackson's chief representative in Mesopotamia, to study as having an important bearing on the work which, it is hoped, will before long be definitely assigned to his firm. 4. A daughter of Sir Salar Jang of Haidarabad, Dakkan, (the Mukram-ud- Daulah) arrived in this country on pilgrimage on the 14th April 1912 and is still here. She has spent a considerable time at Kazimain, has visited Samarra, and is now about to make a journey to Karbala and Najaf. She r is accompanied by about 150 other Indians and is making the pilgrimage with unusual pomp. The Pilgrim Agents have successfully arranged for the convenience of this large party, and a Residency Qawwas has been placed on special duty with her, partly as a dis tinction and partly as a precaution against the ofhci il difficulties, which might easily arise from the presence of so large a body of foreigners travelling together.) 5. His Highness Mir Haji Nur Muhammad Khan of Haidarabad, Sind, is also at the present time journeying in Mesopotamia with some 40 or 50 followers. He brought with him for interment at Karbala, now successfully accomplished, the body of his late uncle Mir Hasan 'Ali Khan, C.I.E., who was much respected and was for over sixty years a loyal subject of the British Crown. Facts like those above recorded serve to illustrate the importance of the Indian pilgrimages to this country. VI. —British Official Matters. 1. It was mentioned in a former reportf that the Qaim-Maqam of Samarra had objected to the wearing of a distinc- t See last Summary, VI-4. British Pilgrim Agent at that place. This objection was the forerunner of acute trouble with the Turkish authorities over the question of the Pilgrim Agents in general; but the matter seems to be now satisfactorily adjusted. The Pilgrim Agency at Samarra had existed for a year without attracting any attention, and at most of the other places where there are Agents their work had been carried on for two years and no friction had arisen. The change of attitude on the part of the Turkish authorities seems to have been due solely to the issue to the Agents of a badge which, it had been repre sented to me, was required to enable the pilgrims to distinguish the authorised agents from impostors. The badge was a metal star bearing in the centre the words in English “ British Pilgrim Agent On the arrival of the Samarra Agent at Baghdad to report his position to me, I wrote an official letter to the Wali in which it was remarked : “ The Pilgrim Agent is a British subject, and his duty is to give Indian pilgrims such assistance as they may require during their pilgrimage at Samarra, as by interpreting, find in' lodgings and carriages for them, etc. The object of the badge is to enable Indian Pilgrims to recognise him A request was added that the Qaim-Maqam might be called on to withdraw his objections to the badge. This was on the 30th April, and on the same day the Wali replied in writ ing : “ As it is contrary to treaties, you will excuse me if I cnnnot recognise, with the exception of the known officers and officials of the British Consulate-General at Baghdad and the British Consulate at Karbala, any official under whatsoever name at Samarra or other places in the Baghdad Wilayat, nor can I allow any other person to wear a distinctive badge .13 I replied the next day in a letter part of which ran as follows : “ I have the honour to explain that the Agent is not an official, and that it is not desired that he should be officially recoginsed by the Turkish officials My con- tentions are (1) that as British Consul-General I am entitled to appoint a private ^ British subject to assist British Indian pilgrims at any place which they may visit in the Baghdad \\ ilayat, and (2) that I am entitled to give such private British subject any special kind of clothing or badge which may be required in order to en able the pilgrims to recognise him By way of explanation, I cited Messrs. Cook’s Tourist Guides and their unforms. The Wali left Baghdad on tour on the day that this letter was sent him and probably did not receive it before his departure. I ordered the Pilgrim Agent (Saiyid Jawwad) to return to Samarra and to re sume his work there, but without wearing his badge until the question had been settled. He arrived at Samarra on the 9th May and was sent for the next morning by the Qaim-Maqam. According to Saiyid Jawwad “ the Qaim-Maqam asked me whether I had brought the order from the Wali. I said that the Consul-General sent him his salaams and had said that, the Wali not being present at Baghdad, the order could not be obtained, and that I should go back to Samarra until the order is sent me. The Qaim-Maqam replied that he recognised neither me nor my Government, that I should at once return to Baghdad, and should also take mv family with me. I said that the steamer was not to start until two days. He replied that I must go and stay with my family on the steamer until it is ready to start, otherwise he would write a report, and bind, my hands and feet, and send me from station to station closely guarded. All the time that W'e were speaking the following persons were present: the Mayor of the Municipality, the Commis sioner of Police, a policeman, and a clerk. I asked the Qaim-Maqam that all that he said might be given me in writing ; whereupon he said that he would never deny it, if he were questioned, and that it was not necessary to write it down. ******** Then I again requested the Qaim-Maqam that I might be allow ed to stay at home, on condition that I should never come out (of my house) or do any work with regard to pilgrims, etc ; but he would not listen to me, and said that I must be present on the steamer at 11 o’clock (native time). Accordingly, I w^ent home to get my family and prepare my luggage. * * ****** ' The next day the Qaim-Maqam himself came on board accompanied by a Yuzloashi and a Zabtiyah to see whether I was there or not”. I believe this statement of Saiyid Jaw r wad to be true in all essentials. It is corroborated by the evidence of the courier of an Indian lady* of high family who happened to be at Samarra at the time, also * See v-4, above. by that of a Residency Qawwas, a British subject, who had been sent on duty with the lady and her following. He may have exaggerated some details; but there is no doubt in my mind that Saiyid Jawwvad was expelled from Samarra by threats, along with his family. The courier de posed : “ Saiyid Jawwrad came and told me in the presence of Muhammad Yusuf, Qawwas, that the Qaim-Maqam had ordered him to leave Samarra at once, else he would send him to Baghdad bound and closely guarded. He seemed very much frightened ; and I insisted very much with him that he should remain that night in Samarra, and told him that the Qaim Maqam would not dare to carry his threat into execution; but he would not hear. He insisted on going on board the steamer, fearing ill-treatment at the hands of the'Qaim-Maqam.” The Qawwas gave the same account of the matter. At the interview between the Pilgrim Agent and the Qaim-Maqam only the Turkish officials mentioned by the Pilgrim Agent were pre sent, so that there is no direct independent evidence of what was said. C233PD, \ But the best confirmation of the general truth of Saiyid JawwacPs assertions is the occurrence, one day previously, of a similar incident at Musaiyib, which is 100 miles from Samarra as the crow flies and situated in a different Sanjaq. The British V ice-Consul at Karbala reported to me under date 11th May as follows :— “ On Thursday, the 9th instant, the Zabitiyah Commandant of Musaiyib sent for Saiyid Hasan, the Pilgrim Agent, and ordered him that under instructions from the Mutasarrif of Kar bala h^ must leave the pilgrim service and Musaiyib, unless he was staying there for a change or for some other business of his own. He showed him the Mutasarrif’s telegram which. Saiyid Hasan said, contained that the appointment of such employes was against treaties, and, therefore, if Saiyid Hasan insists upon meeting the pilgrims on the carriage stations, he should be expelled from Musaiyib. Some argument, however, took place between the officer and Saiyid Hasan, in course of which he told the former that he w’as sent by the Consulate to act as interpreter bet ween the Indian pilgrims and the coolies, etc., and that he could not give up his duty unless he received orders from the Consulate. In reply the officer advised Saiyid Hasan that, ii he did not give up the work or leave Musaiyib, he would be treated by the Government in a way which w'ould be quite unexpected and insulting to him. “ In the meantime, a Zabitiyah turned up and took Saiyid Hasan to the Mudir himself. * * * * * He gave the same warning to Saiyid Hasan and told him that he could stay in Musaiyib only on condition that he should not approach the carriage stations nor have any dealings with the Indians who pass through Musaiyib. His last advice to him was to leave Musaiyib of his own accord before unpleasant steps are taken against him.” The Vice-Consul ordered the Pilgrim Agent, who appeared at Karbala, 20 miles from Musaiyib, on the 11th May, to return to his post “ and attend his work, but very cautiously, and so as not to give rise to any quarrel or fighting with the officials or others.” On the 12th May the Assistant Wali, Lutfi Bey, who is perfectly loyal to his superior officer but seems to me to have disapproved of the WalPs action in regard to the Pilgrim Agents, sent an official reply, under telegraphic instructions from the Wali, to my letter of the 1st May. It was conciliatory in tone and indicated lines upon which a settlement might be reached. In it the objection to the Agents' badges was restricted to badges “ showing that they belong to the Consulate,” a re duced demand which showed that the Turkish authorities had begun to reflect on the case, but an irrelevant one inasmuch as the existing badges had no consular character. i On the 17th May the Assistant Wali came to see me about the question, and we discussed it in a friendly manner ; but he had not the power, apparently, to settle anything in the absence of the Wali. Hardly had Lutfi Bey left the Residency when I received a letter from the Vice-Consul at Karbala informing me that two Pilgrim Agents at Najaf had been deprived of their badges by the local authorities, and that the Agent at Musaiyib was still being prevented from performing his duties. I at once wrote semi-officially to Lutfi Bey, informing him of what had occurred, and urging him to issue suitable orders for the return of the badges and the non-molesta tion of the Musaiyib Agent, by which means the case would be prevented from be coming more serious. As I was to see the Assistant Wali the next day at the Sarai on other business, it seemed unnecessary to do more. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala had protested to the Tahrirat Mudiri, in the absence of the Mutasarrif on tour, against the treatment of the Najaf Agents. They had, according to a telegram from one of them, been carried before the Qaim Maqam of Najaf by the police and forced to give up their badges. In his argu ment with the Tahrirat Mudiri Mr. Muhammad Hasan ‘ 4 mentioned the servants of the shrines, the Chaooshes of Persian pilgrims, and other people who carried tilver badges quite openly and yet no attempt was made on the part of the Government to prevent them/ , The Vice-Consul’s protest was of course un availing. On the 18th May I had an interview at the Sarai with the Assistant Wali, but the best arrangement that I could make with him was that the status quo should be maintained until I had an opportunity of discussing matters with the Wali, who was already on his way from Basrah, returning from his tour nearly a month earlier than had been expected.15 • P*? 21st May the Assistant Mali sent me, officially, the two badges which had been taken from the Agents at Najaf. Meanwhile, almost from the beginning of the case, I had been in constant correspondence by telegram with His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Cons tantinople. On the 3rd May, the Ambassador informed me of apparently erro neous information having been given by the Wali to the Porte regarding the status claimed for the British Pilgrim Agents in Mesopotamia, and I replied placing His Excellency in possession of the whole facts of the case. Subsequent ly, on the 11th May, Sir Gerard Lowther informed me that the Wali had been ins tructed to settle the case directly with me at Baghdad, if possible ; these instructions were, no doubt, the cause of the Assistant Wall’s conciliatory letter of the 12th May. The compromise suggested in that letter was reported by me to His Britan nic Majesty’s Ambassador on the 13th of May ; but 1 remarked at the same time that the ignominious expulsion of the Samarra Pilgrim Agent and the threatened similar expulsion of the Agent at Musaiyib, which had then just come to my knowledge, placed matters on a changed footing. His Excellency then informed me, on the 16th May, that he had protested strongly against the expulsion of the Agents and had asked the Porte to direct that they should be reinstated and that all molestation of them should cease : as a result of these representations orders had been sent to the Wali to re-admit the persons expelled, and the Wali had been again desired to arrange matters with me locally. On the 21st May, the Ambassador informed me that the Wali had wired to the Porte from Basrah denying knowledge of the expulsion of any of the Agents : this denial did not strike me with the surprise that I should have felt had I been a stranger to Turkey. His Excellency added that the Baghdad authorities had been ordered not to interfere further with the Agents pending a settlement of the case, and he enquired whether the expulsion of an Agent could be proved. Two days later His Excellency telegraphed tome again to say that the M ali had complained to the Porte of my having established a “ tribunal ” at Kazimain with a “ shield ’ ’ over the door, and that the establishment consisted of ^ President , a Secretary and a Qawwas ”. Sir Gerard Lowther natural!} enquired what foundation there was for these allegations, explaining that the Porte were much disturbed by the news, and that the present time when a general settlement of Mesopotamian questions was in progress, was a particularly unsuitable one for innovations and incidents. In the so-called “ tribunal ” I had no difficulty in recognising the head office of the Pilgrim Bureau, where a Superintendent, a Clerk and two Pilgrim Agents work ; but the term ‘ ‘ tribunal ’ ’ somewhat mystified me until I found that, on moving into new premises a few days before, the Superintendent had put a board over the door with a card on which was written in ink : “ Mahkamah Ihtimam Zairin ” ie “ Pilgrim Supervision Bureau ”. In Turkish “ Mahkamah ” means a ' Court” • in Hindustani it and the word “ Daftar ”, which in Turkish would have been equally misunderstood as referring to the Daftar Khaqani or Land Becords Department, are the only two equivalents of “ Bureau.”. On the 25th May, I answered His Excellency ’s questions, explaining that independent direct evidence of the treatment of the Samarra Agent was not likely to be given except by British subjects ; and I also cleared up the mis understanding about the “ tribunal.” His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador replied on the next day informino- me that the word “ Mahkamah ” was unsuitable, as being liable to misinterpretation ; that it seemed inadvisable to press the expulsion question, provided expulsion was not any longer enforced ; that the Wali had received very stringent orders to discuss matters with me in a reasonable manner: and that the Porte did not seem disposed 1 to support him in any aggressive or offensive policy. ^ j On the 27th May, I received a message that the Wali was anxious to see me that very day to discuss the whole matter; and in the evening I went to his private house accompanied by Captain Scott, whose presence I thought desirable. The repudiation by the Wali of the undoubted expulsion of the Samarra Agent, whichcould hardly have occurred without orders from him sufficient to warrant the Qaim-Maqam in his violent action, made me feel that it was necessary to be circum spect in my dealing with him. We found the Wali with the Assistant Wali, and though the conversation was a long one, no unpleasantness occurred. I agreed to remove the obnoxious signboard at Kazimain which had been put up without my knowledge. I also accepted a modification of the badge, and promised to send the Wali a list of the Pilgrim Bureau staff. He on his part undertook that there should be no further interference with the Agents, on the understanding that they were not officials and that, if they committed any misdemeanours, they should be dealt with as ordinary British subjects. As to such an understanding there hacP 1 never of course been any difficulty on my part, as is shown by my letter of 1st May. It is a fact, though absurd, that the Wali had no exact knowledge about the badge complained of until I placed a specimen in his hands on the 27th of May, nor had Lutfi Bey seen it till I showed him one on the 17th or 18th. Lutfi Bey declared that he saw nothing objectionable about the badge, though this opinion, I think, he intended for my ear alone. The Wali stared at it for a long time in evident mortification, having evidently expected something different, but he eventually declared that it must be altered, for reasons which he did not attempt to explain. It is possible that in regard to the badge he had been misled by the highly-coloured reports of subordinates ; but I cannot excuse him for having alarm ed the Porte unnecessarily with the “ tribunal ” mare’s nest—evidently after his return to Baghdad — when he could easily have ascertained the true facts by send ing a note or a messenger to me. Perhaps the most ridiculous thing is that the new badge agreed upon, bearing the words “ Indian Pilgrim Guide,” in vernacular, is to be accompanied by a special cap which will give the Agents a more imposing appearance than formerly ; yet this was the Wali’s own suggestion ! Since our interview the Wali and I have exchanged letters ratifying our agree ment ; and he has published a very suitable communique in the press explaining the misunderstanding about the Kazimain “ tribunal ”. The Wali’s fear of the press and his own chauvinistic instincts and impetuous temper sufficiently account for all the trouble that has occurred. In my final letter to the Wali, I was careful to state that the removal of the board over the Pilgrim Bureau door and the altera tion of the badges were “ out of friendship to you, Sir, not because I consider that they are officially necessary.” 2. At the same time that theWali complained of the “ tribunal ” at Kazi main he further excited the fears of the Porte by informing them that I had.appoint ed official headmen for different quarters of the town of Baghdad. He referred, of course, to the appointment of Lambardars* by me in the Indian community. Turkish detectives were employed to investi- * See last Summary, VI-3. gate this simple fact, which (and all about the Lambardars) the Wali could have learned by simply referring to me. His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador had apparently no difficulty in satisfying the Porte, on information supplied by me, that the Lambardars were for the internal affairs of the British community only and that their existence was unobjection able. Consequently, at our interview on the 27th May, the Wali informed me, on my asking him, that he had nothing to say against Lambardars provided that their functions were restricted to dealings between myself and the British Indians. He was, possibly, a little ashamed that the alarmist report which he had sent in behind my back should com} to my knowledge. 3. It is regrettable to find that the subj ect of the Oudh Bequest has been occupy- iny the Wali’s attention under the same conditions of secrecy and prejudice as those of the Pilgrim Agents and the Lambardars. I had already informed t See last Summary, VI-2. Government of the appearance of intri- guesf against the reorganisation of the Oudh Bequest and of the seeming connection of the Turkish authorities with them. That connection is now established beyond possibility of doubt; and the adverse action of the Turkish authorities is showing itself in two ways, through their own subjects and through the Persian Consulate-General and its nationals.At the end of April and beginning of May, ther? were privy intrigues on foot at Karbala and Najaf against the reformed administration of the Bequest. Their objective was evidently the restoration of the old corrupt order, under which the Mujtahids were able to make free with the whole of the funds entrusted to them for distribution. The line of action decided on seems to have been the drawing up of petitions to the Shaikh-ul-Islam at Constantinople, the Wali of Baghdad, etc., in which it should be argued that the new arrangements were * contrary to the King of Oudh’s Will, to Muhammadan Law, and what not. The petitions were also to contain suggestions likely to dis turb the Porte, c.^., that the distribution of charity as now conducted was likely to increase British prestige in Mesopotamia, that it might lead to sedition, and so on. There seems to be no doubt that various petitions were actually drawn up, and more may be heard of them hereafter at Constantinople and Tehran. I am informed that some of the Mujtahids distributors, who had accepted the new conditions by drawing money under them, have now signed the petitions. A part, in forward ing these intrigues which were primarily Persian, seems to have been taken by Saiyid Hasan (Kurd), the Turkish official preacher f who made himself cons picuous at the time of the war agitation, tjSeeSummary for January, ni-2. an( j Mutasarrif of Karbala. These officials seem to have exerted themselves to obtain influential signatures to the petitions. * The effect of the wording of the Will of the Kjng of Oudh was very carefully weighed by the Government of India before they sanction ed the late reorganisation of the Bequest. The Government are themselves the trustees of the Bequest; and the King of Oudh, if he were alive to-day. would be a British subject, the Kingdom of Oudh having merged in British India, it follows, I think, that pretensions on the part ot a Foreign Power to discuss the interpre tation and mode of execution of the Will could not be entertained by the British Government. J. G. L. The attitude of the Wali of Baghdad to the Oudh Bequest came out clearly : in my interview with him of the 27th May, when he said that Turkish subjects could not be permitted to sit on the Bequest Committees at Karbala and Najaf, that all enquiries about the Ottoman poor would have to be made by the Com mittees through the Turkish local authorities, and that any relief intended by the Committees fot poor Ottoman subjects must be disbursed through the same official medium. On my rejoining that the procedure suggested was hardly practicable, and that the result of its adoption was likely to be the virtual exclusion of poor Ottomans from the benefits of the Bequest, he rejoined that this did not matter ; it appeared to me, in fact, that he welcomed this as a probable consequence. I have no doubt, after this, that the withdrawal^ + See last Summary, \ 1 - 2 . 0 f g a iyid Hasan, Hakimzadah, from the Oudh Bequest Committee at Karbala, was dictated by the Wali, also the Saiyid’s letter to the papers. I reported the Wall's views the same evening to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador by telegram, adding that in my opinion the inclusion of Ottoman subjects in the Committees ought really to be regarded as a guarantee that we had no secret political objects in the distribution ; and that, if the Turkish claim to intervene in Bequest matters were entertained, the way would be payed for similar claim on the part of the Persian Government and so for an internationalisation of the Bequest —which was out of the question. I ventured to suggest that His Ex- cellencv might be able to ascertain whether the narrow and distrustful views of the Wali were likely to be shared by the Porte. After our interview the Wali sought to entrap me into an admission, by means of an official letter, that a final arrangement had been reached between us on the subject of the Bequest. I replied, however, that I had not intended our conversa tion to form the basis of an official agreement; that I took note of his views, which I had already reported to the British Ambassador at Constantinople ; but that, pending a decision by the higher authoritties, I should abstain from dealing dirsctK with Ottoman subjects in Bequest matters. Certain action which the Wali has seen fit to take by Persian agency seems even less justifiable than his attempts to thwart the work of the Bequest by means of Ottoman subjects. The nature of his indirect action will be apparent from C233FDthe following extracts from a letter, dated 27th May—which I have received from the British Vice-Consul at Karbala. The Vice-Consul writes : “ On Saturday 25th, the Persian Consul sent * i.e., all the Persian members of the Oudh for all the members * of the Committee and Bequest Committee at Karbala. communicated to them an order which he had . m, ti i * V&gt; Yj j recently received fromt Mukarram-us-Sultaneh t The Persian Consul-General at Baghdad. . J ; J. G. L. 111 repetition ot his first letter about disassociat ing the members from dealing in the matter of the Oudh Bequest. After leaving the Consulate two of them came to me and explained all that was contained in the letter which was addressed to the Consul in friendly terms, not officially. It was headed by the words Unofficial and Confidential and commenced by Fidayai shayam and similar expressions which no senior officer would use to a subordinate directly under his control. “ Discussing about the members it said that formerly a warning was conveyed to them at the instance of the Wali, but a few days ago it seems that the Committee again set up in the Vice-Consulate and disposed of some papers and accounts which were sent to them from Bagh dad in connection with the Oudh Bequest. The news having reached the Wali he has addressed another official letter to the Persian Consulate-General, in which he has very strongly demanded the prevention of the Persian members, and their giving resignation to the local authorities, and announcing! the same in some Baghdad papers f Like Saiyid Hasan, Hakimzadah. see above. ag p roo f 0 f their integrity and submission to the J- • L - order. Should they neglect to do so, the Wali adds, or insist upon attending the Vice-Consulate in connection with the Oudh Bequest, the Government will be obliged to scheme out a severe punishment for them from which they would not be able to escape. Similar instructions were sent to the Mutr.sarrif of Karbala, and the Consul-General was asked to direct the Karbala Consul to take the necessary steps in con sultation with the Mutasarrif, who would be too pleased to help him in the matter. . “ In stating his own order Mukarram-us-Sultan has impressed a strong abhorrence of his being the medium of preventing people from associating in charitable affairs, bW, owing to his inability to resist the Wali, he ordered that the contents of His Excellency’s letter should be communicated to the Persians only, formally, without using force or pressure to make them give up their posts. He, however, mentioned that they should be informed of the Govern ment’s attitude towards the money and the Committee, in which if they continue they will probably cause danger to themselves which he may not be able to redress. “ The Karbala Consul showed them the letter and very mildly advised them to hold aloof from the Committee, or else they will suffer from bad consequences. The members gave hi m different answers ; and there was some argument too, in which the Consul said nothing but stuck to his friendly admonitions which were occasionally expressed wtih feelings of reli gionism and regret for lack of sympathy and patriotism on the part of the members. The Mutasarrif was not a partner of the Consul in this warning, and it is thought that in the next sitting of the Committee some of the members will refuse to attend because of their fear from the authorities. ” There seems to be no doubt that the Persian J Consul-General, who is an eminently sensible man, is really favourable } See Summary for January, III-S. Q U( J} 1 Bequest as UOW managed : witness the following report by the Residency Second Dragoman, an Afghan, who visited him on the 24th of May. Speaking of a tour to Karbala from which he had just returned, the Mukarram-us-Sultana “ said that he told the Mujtahids that, if they thought he had come for the Oudh Bequest, their idea was simply silly inasmuch as he had not the least connection with the money or a shadow of a title to interfere in the matter. Then I gave him the history of the Bequest and the recent developments, such as the neglect of the Mujtahids of the duty of distributors, and an outline of the present arrangements. He was very much pleased and said that a man with a single grain of conscience would never like to wrench a morsel from the hand of a destitute and put it into the mouth of a gardan-Jculuft (— a thick-neck, i.e., a Mujtahid). His declarations seemed sincere, and his ridicule of the Mujtahids was hearty. “ I have noted with much surprise that of late an air of independence of the Mujtahids pervades the whole Persian Consulate-General and its staff. The reason is not known It must be remembered that the Persian Consul-General at Baghdad is, in the present helpless state of his Government and country, very much at the mercy of the Wali and quite unable to protect his own subjects. An instance of this has just occurred in connection with this very matter of the Oudh Bequest. On the19 night of the 26th May the arrest of a Persian subject named Haji Muhammad Taqi (Yazdi) on a charge of having written favourably about the British management of the Oudh Bequest in the “ Sada Babil, ” a local newspaper, was reported to me. His letter, which appeared in the number of the 24th May, ran as follows, it seems perfectly innocent:— “ The Oudh Bequest. ” It is well known that this charitable fund continued to be distributed to the poor by an Alim ai Karbala and Najaf to the amount of 10,000 Rupees a month ( half of which was'dis bursed at Karbala and half at Najaf) under the supervision of the British Consulate until the time of Consul-General Newmarch. That officer, when he saw that the said distribubon was not made properly, appointed 20 ’Ulama in order that the money might be distributed by them at Karbala or at Najaf, and each of the said ’Ulama distributed 500 Rupees ; but, because the poor complained to the dama of India iliat the money was not being distributed properly, Mr. Lorimer, the present Consul-General, made * a humane arrangement in favour of the poor. The change was not made by me but order- He divided f the said money into two shares, one for the ’Ulama and the other for the poor. To distribute the share of the poor he appointed a mixed Committee consisting of Arabs, Persians and Indians under the presidency of the Vice- Consul of Karbala ; and the money began to be distributed in a manner unprecedented for excel lence since the establishment of the said charity, and all the poor received their proper shares. ed by the Government of India after two years’ deliberation. J. G. L. f This description of the change is not techni cally correct. A moiety of each ’Alim’s share is transferred by him to the Committee. This is now the condition on which each ’Alim holds his share. J. G. L. “ Some persons have thought that this way of distribution is harmful to the policy of the Ottoman Government. This opinion is valueless and is a bad one for the poor. We ask this question : Can the distribution of the said money to the poor, orphans, and widows have any connection with political affairs ? ’ It is being distributed since 90 years and nobody has ever thought that it was harmful. How is it that it is harmful in respect to politics ? Persons who think so must think wilfully in accordance with their personal views. ” “We thank all those who have a share in the good work connected with this great charity. “ More especially we thank Sa’adat Agha Muhammad Hasan Khan Bahadur, British Vice- Consul at Karbala, who always does his best in the matter of the distribution, and we ask him in the nam&gt; of humanuy not to listen to the words of partisans who cause harm to the poor orphans and widows. “ We have no doubt that he is a good-hearted and sincere man and that he never ceases from doing good.” “ May God reward him.” I caused the matter to be investigated and obtained, on the 31st May, the fol lowing report from a reliable source :— Haji Muhammad Taqi “ was not put regularly into prison but was detained in a room next to that of the Mudir of Police. It is said that the Persian Consul-General was specially re quested by the Wali not to interfere in this matter as the prisoner is a Persian subject and the Persian Consul-General promised to do so. On 29th instant, the prisoner was asked to furnish a Turkish subject as security, but he could not produce one. The prisoner asked for being tried by the judicial courts under the Press Act, but his request was not allowed by the Wali. “Yesterday in the afternoon he was sent out of Baghdad under custody to be handed over to Persian authorities on the frontier to be taken to Kirmanshah. In the morning, however, a strong pressure had been brought to bear upon the Persian Consul-General to intercede for him with the Wali. The Persian Consul-General went and requested the Wali to set him free, as the punishment undergone by him was sufficient. The Wali did not agree. The Persian Consul-General then requested him that the prisoner may be given three or four days’ time to find a suitable security, but this proposal was also rejected. The prisoner was sent out the very evening. “The Wali is said to be very much put out with the prisoner and considers his article as spreading the influence of the British in ’Iraq to the prejudice of Turkish prestige. “Haji Taqi, the prisoner, is a nephew (sister’s son) of our Vice-Consul at Karbala, and is a Persian subject.” No doubt Haji Muhammad Taqi’s object was to vindicate his uncle’s reputa tion, and the desire does him credit; but he has only himself to thank for the conse quences of his rash interference. The Vice-Consul is a British subject, but Haji Muhammad Taqi is not, and I cannot therefore take any sort of steps on his behalf. I i ’ •An interesting and important crisis in the history of the Oudh Bequest has evidently arrived. The Government of India had only just sanctioned a reform of the Bequest arrangements upon conservative lines; but it now looks as if the direct action of the Turkish authorities and their pressure upon the Persia,n consular re presentatives here might necessitate greater changes. I presume that, if the Turk ish Government hold the same views as the local Wali, viz., that no Ottoman sub ject can have any connection with or interest in,the Bequest under our manage ment, we can only acquiesce. If the Persians allow themselves to be intimidated into boycotting the Bequest as managed by us,—and they have every reason to fear both the will and the power of the Turkish hierarchy to injure them if they hesitate —it is not clear that the British Gove rnment is in any way bound, or even in a position, to argue the matter with ti e Porte on their behalf. The result of the abs tention of Turkish and Persian subjects will be, automatically, to restrict the ma nagement and benefits of the Beque? t to B itish subjects, that is to Indians. Such an issue would of course be hailed wr h delight by all Indians; but the question is a large one, and there might be disadvantages in the change. In particular, it is probable that the influx of Indians from India into Karbala and Najaf would be greatly stimulated. This is a consequence which the Turks themselves would re gret, when they came to realise it; and they will also have to bear the brunt of the wide-spread discontent which will ensue if the very numerous Persian, and fewer Turkish, poor are excluded from the distributions. I am still hopeful that the matter may adjust itself as far as Persian subjects are concerned: the next distribution will bring this hope to the test. 4. To revert to the subject of pilgrim arrangements, I was informed by Muhammad Qasim ’Ali Khan, a gentlemam of good social position from Lucknow, who visited me on the T7th May, that the last time he came to this country on pil grimage, about 15 years ago, it cost him not less than eight shillings to land at Basrah. This time, the Pilgrim Agent assisting him, he obtained his passage to the shore for one shilling. It was a considerable saving in a single item of the expenditure of a single pilgrim at a single place, and I estimate that the money saved to Indian pilgrims in general during a year must far exceed what the Oudh Bequest Committee spend on the maintenance of the Pilgrim Agents. 5. It was only to be expected that the pilgrim arrangements should attract considerable notice in India, but it is in some ways a pity that they have done so. One result is articles in the native Indian press which, though extremely favourable and very laudatory, are apt to be ill-informed and to contain politically tactless re marks. Fortunately, the contents of newspapers published in Hindustani in India are not very likely to come to the notice of the local Turkish authorities, though there is always the possibility of this happening. The connection of the pilgrim arrangements with the Oudh Bequest is generally ignored, probably for want of correct information, and the impression is conveyed that they have been officially instituted by the British Government. In the July 1911 number of the “ShFah Journal”, a review published in the Saran district, I find the following editorial comment, mad) no doubt in perfect good faith, but none the less infelicitous from a political standpoint: “ The alertness and energy of the Pilgrim Bureau will not only benefit the Indians; it will gradually become a source of protection to Persian and Russian Muhammadan pilgrims, whose respective Governments will follow the same lines to provide for their convenience.” This is probably just what the Turks fear. I cannot think of any means fcr preventing remarks in the Indian press, but they will perhaps cease as the pilgrim arrangements here lose their novelty. I also receive some gratuitous advice from Indian sympathisers, who are un known to me. One such, who appears to be an official in His Highness the Nizam’s library at Haidarabad (Dakkhan) has lately sent me a number of suggestions, some of which are of a very awkward character. One is that letters for India should be collected at Karbala, Najaf, etc., and forwarded to the British Post Office at Baghdad under consular arrangements for posting to India ; this would of course be an unwarrantable encroachment on the rights of the Ottoman Post Office, though presumably there can be no objection to individuals sending their letters by pri vate arrangement from Karbala or Najaf to be stamped and posted at the British21 ILHf Ga/ettp ” “ Romhav ” j , ,. ce0 ' ilKlla . “ United Provinces “ All-India Shia’ah Gazette ” of LuXow th? “^saTX^ fTn 33 ‘r® “Shi ah ' of Saran district, and the “ Za^ndt ” of UhoS I haS^ it more prudent not to reply to this communication. tnought it 6.

At the same interview I discussed with the Assistant Wali the nationality of three British Indian subjects whom the Director of Political Affairs had been siim- monmg very persistently through the police in connection with payment of Tamattu The Turkish authorities, in their usual slipshod way, had got the names of two of them incorrectly ; but I was able to bring with me to the Sarai the three persons who were really required. I had no difficulty in convincing the Assistant Wali of the British nationality of all three, and I have little doubt that the result will be equally satisfactory in almost all cases in which the Turkish authorities can be persuaded to meet me fairly in argument. 7. Mr. Extross, the Postmaster of the British Post Office at Baghdad, has been seriously ill for three weeks and unable to perform his duties. Last autumn too he was on the sick list for about five weeks. The remaining staff consists of one untrained clerk and one postman, both of whom are Turkish subiects C233FJ322 During Mr. Extross’ first illness I appointed one of my own clerks to take charge of the Post Office, which he did to the best of his ability ; but he lost a sum equal to his own pay for about three months from the Post Office chest. This may have been due to the dishonesty of his assistants, but the cause could not be traced from the accounts, and he is paying up the deficit by instalments. On the present occasion I have asked Mr. Gaskin, my Commercial Assistant, to lay his proper duties aside and take charge of the Post Office until a relief, for whom I have telegraphed to the Postmaster-General, Bombay, arrives. I have instructed Mr. Gaskin, with a view to avoiding money risks as far as possible, not to accept any postal orders, money orders, or value payable parcels for despatch ; but he has of course to pay or deliver those which arrive from abroad. It is most unfair to anyone without technical training to place him in charge of a Post Office which does so much money business as that at Baghdad ; but the only alternative here was to close the Post Office altogether, which for political, and still more for commercial and general reasons, was impossible. I have now written to the Government of India suggesting that, to meet similar emergencies in future, the clerk should be a trained postal official capable of taking over the Postmaster’s work. I have also pointed out to them the extreme undesir ability, not to say danger, for various reasons of employing Turkish subjects inside a British Post Office in Turkey. VII.— Foreign Interests and Cases (Except Persian and British.) 1. I have seen both Meissner Pasha and Dr. Endrucks since their return from Basrah. \ The former, with a secrecy which he seldom uses, gave me to understand that the question of the transport of Baghdad Railway materials from Basrah up to the Tigris had now been practically arranged. He expected that there would be seven tugs and 18 or 20 barges in all, and that the whole of the running arrange ments would be virtually confided to Messrs. Lynch, though this would not be openly stated. Dr. Endrucks, at a visit which he paid me, took great pains to prove that he was not and had never been an Anglophobe, and that he had not really opposed an arrangement with Lynch, though this had been asserted. His attitude suggests that a ra'p'prcchement has taken place between the Baghdad Railway Company and Messrs, Lynch, and that Dr. Endrucks is a little afraid of being thrown overboard by his own side in the interests of the new understanding. Meissner Pasha has now again left Baghdad, this time in the direction of Musal. I'understand that he has gone to arrange, along with an Ottoman Commissioner, for expropriation of the lands required for the railway on that side. 2. The triumphal entry into Musal on the 26th April of Baron Von Oppenheim, the wealthy German traveller and archaeological excavator, seems to have caused some stir in the place. He had marched straight across country from Ras-al- Ain where his excavations are. He has since his arrival been touring extensively round Musal and has engaged a house in the town ; and engineers who are with him have been taking observations. He is credited with a design of buying up land in the Yazidi country. His ostentatious habits are not unknown to me, as I had an opportunity of observing them last year at Aleppo; but it is difficult to imagine that he is really a dangerous political intriguer. If he were one the Turks, who are adepts at that sort of work, would erenow have found means of restricting the liberties which he permits himself in the way of surveys, etc. 3. The premises of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., a German firm at Basrah, con taining the German Consulate, were burned down on the 17th May, My German colleague at Baghdad, wffio happened to be at Basrah at the time to send his wufe off to Europe, nearly lost a valuable collection of Persian carpets in the conflagra tion. He informs me that he believes the firm s losses are co\eredby insurance, bid; not perhaps those of some of their employes who were living in the house.’ 23 4. v At the end of April two Frenchmen belonging to the French archaeological staff at Susa in Arabistan, Persia, were at Baghdad. They were M. Toscanne and M. de Mecquenem ; the latter, who is the younger, is by profession a mining engineer. On their way up from Basrah they tried to reach the ancient site of Talloh, formerly excavated by a French mission ; but the place is on the confines of the Muntafik country, and they had to turn back. They left Baghdad for Europe via Musal in the company of Mr. Freeman, a young American journalist travelling in the same direction ; but I understand that they will return to field work in Persia next winter. The French system in these hot countries—that of being on the ground during the winter only and of devoting the summer to the elaboration of results at home, seems much more conducive than the German system of continuous local work to the preservation of the hea lth, energy and interest of th 3 staff. The regrettable absence at present of British archaeologists in Mesopotamia, • See last Summary, vii-5. where so many of other nationalities are seen, struck me* again forcibly on the passage of these French visitors through Baghdad. 5. The Duke of Parma was touring in the Baghdad Wilayat in April and May. His behaviour gave rise to some comment, especially his avoidance of towns. He did not, lam assured, enter either Karbala or Najaf, though he camped outside both. His reputation here for eccentricity, which may be quite undeserved, and his near approach to Baghdad were among the causes assigned by quidnuncs for the Wali’a sudden departure on tour on 1st May. The Duke was not everywhere received as being his authentic self ; in fact, at Babylon he was introduced by one member of the German archaeological staff to the rest with the words : ' This is the Duke of Parma, and I am the Emperor of China.” VIII.— Commercial Matters. 1. The Eastern Bank, notwithstanding the unfavourable*)- circumstances which + c VTTI _ attended its opening here, seems in a fair k ummary, - - wa ^ to k ecome established at Baghdad. Mr. Manwaring, the acting Agent, is a discreet as well as an energetic young man. The bitterest opponents of the new Bank are the private Jewish bankers, into whose business it threatens to cut heavily. The Manager of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at first attempted to refuse to recognise Mr. Manwaring as Agent of the Eastern Bank, notwithstanding the possession by him of a power of attorney duly registered in this Consulate-General; but a telegram from the head office obliged Mr. Grabowski to abandon his obstructive attitude. The Baghdad Railway Company at present appear disposed to transfer their financial business, or part of it from the Imperial Ottoman Bank to the Eastern Bank and have already employed the latter to some extent. A fortnight ago, I found that the Eastern Bank were selling bills on home a half per cent, cheaper than the Ottoman Bank ; and a week ago Mr. Manwaring informed me that he had on the previous Monday, the day on which the weekly rate of exchange at Baghdad is fixed, announced his rate at an earlier hour than the Imperial Ottoman Bank and so secured a greater share than they of the business for the outgoing British and Turkish mails yet at a profitable rate. But disquieting symptoms of intrigues are not wanting. Mr. Manwaring has been pestered by visits from members of the local Chamber of Commerce, who strongly advise him to start business “ in the usual way ” by sending out circulars and registering the Bank with the Chamber of Commerce. He has ignored these suggestions, and I think wisely, as the object may be to create an opportunity for refusing to recognise the Bank. The real crux will come when the Bank find them selves obliged to take some client into court; they may then possibly be told that their suit cannot be entertained until they are registered with the Chamber of Com merce and have obtained permission from the Turkish Government to carrying on business in Turkey, etc., etc. 2. With reference to the affairs of Messrs. Mashal Brothers, the Wali has now informed me that, according to telegraphic orders from the Ministry of Commerce, the firm, being an anonymous Company, can only be permitted to open their work shop if they comply with “ the Regulations ” and obtain a “ Baiyannamah ” from24 the Ministry, or else accept Ottoman nationaliy. I have replied asking what Re gulations are meant, and asking that a copy of them may be lent me, if convenient. 3. There has been considerable talk of an embargo on the export of cereals from the Baghdad Wilayat, but none has been officially imposed. I have nevertheless received a complaint of the stoppage of a shipment of grain from Tawainj, on the ^ Hindiyah, which was being made on account of British exporters at Basrah. The truth seems to be that the Wali recommended an embargo, and possibly issued orders for one in anticipation of sanction, but that his proposal has not been approved at Constantinople. 4. A fire broke out on the 11th May in the chief Municipal kerosine Depot at Baghdad ; and the entire contents, the property of private merchants, were destroved. The fire continued burning for several days. It is confidently antici pated that the Municipality will have to make good the losses of the depositors. That unfortunate British firm,* Messrs. * See paragraph immediately preceding. BrotherS) have lost £150 worth of petrol in the conflagration, and they are lodging a request for payment of the value through this Consulate-General. * The Municipality will now perhaps understand that there is risk as well as profit in warehousing inflammable substances at their own responsibility, and this may dispose them to abandon their objection to the establishment of private stores under municipal supervision. Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Company have for more than two years been trying to get permission to establish a private kerosine store,—a right which they seem entitled to claim under the law ; but their efforts have so far been frustrated by the interested opposition of the Baghdad Municipality. IX.—General and Miscellaneous. 1. Saiyid Ibrahim, nephew and son-in-law of the Naqib of Baghdad, left . „ , TV . here for Bombay on the 7th May 1912. t See e.g., ummary or e ruary, . India is a happyf hunting ground for the memoers of his family, hospitality and offerings being forthcoming in abundance ; and it does not appear that their tours there have any political significance. The attitude of the Naqib family at Baghdad to this Residency is very friendly, but without being demonstrative, for the suspiciousness of the Turks imposes great caution on them in their dealings with foreigners. 2. I was informed at the end of May that a well-known apostle of pan- Islamism, Saiyid Rashid Raza, editor of the “ A1 Manar ” newspaper (Egypt), had lately arrived at Basrah. He is expected daily at Baghdad, where, it is said, he will be the guest of the Naqib.. It is understood that this propagandist was not long ago in India and visited the Punjab, where he is said to have reconciled the editors of the “ Watan ” and the “ Zamindar ”, two newspapers described to me as pan-Islamic, between whom there was a feud. 3. A case of plague occurred at Basrah during the past month, and a medical inspection at Baghdad of river steamers arriving from Basrah was for a short time in force. There is no news of fresh cases from Basrah, and the medical - inspection at Baghdad has now been withdrawn. The ideas of the Turkish officials on sanitary matters seem to have grown considerably more sane and reasonable at Baghdad during the last two years. 4. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal writes as follows under date 17th May :—“ Abdul Messih, a deposed patriarch of the Jacobites, arrived recently in Musal; he is old and imbecile ; he intends to go to India, where there has recently been a serious split among the Jacobites. I understand that the presence of this old man is likely to cause great trouble there, and the Jacobites of Musal have been doing their best to prevent him going.” Abdul Messih, accompanied by a priest, called on me at Baghdad between the middle and end of May. He still adhered to his idea of visiting India, and he asked me to telegraph his intentions to that country, but I declined to do so.5. I have lately had occasion to .examine the archives of this Residency, and find that even the oldest, dating back more than a century , are in excellent preservation. An extract from the Residency Letter Book for 1812, under date 21st May, is attached to this Summary. J. G. LORIMER, I.C.S., Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad. British Residency and Consulate-General; ^ Baghdad the 4th June 1912. J Baghdad Diary, 1812. Baghdad, the 21st May 1812. —Wrote and closed the following letter to the Honourable the Governor in Council. To The Hon’ble George Brown, President and Governor in Council, Bombay. Honourable Sir, I have the honour to lay before your Honourable Board the account of an affair, which recently occurred here, and which will forcibly illustrate the unprece dented influence I at present enjoy. It will be necessary to observe that Suliman, Pasha, who governed Baghdad for thirty years with a reputation that scarcely any other Vizir ever enjoyed and is considered as the head of the present Dynasty (all the members of which includ ing the two last Pashas were his personal slaves), left several sons the eldest of whom, Said Beg, possesses in the greatest degree the love and veneration of nearly the whole of the inhabitants of the Pashalik by whom his father's memory is almost idolized. The Pashas and great officers of Baghdad have ever been accustomed to treat this young man with the most profound respect and he is considered as of too high rank to hold any employment under the Government. The present Kiahya Beg, or Lieutenant-Governor of the Pashalik, having an evident view to the succession in case of the decease of the Pasha, who is far ad vanced in years, and fearing the uncommon influence that Said Beg possessed over the people might interfere with his designs, lately began an unjust and impolitic system of persecution against him which had an evident tendency to fix him still stronger in the affections of the people. He took away from him some of his own Georgian slaves and manoeuvred till he persuaded the Pasha to deprive him of one of his principal estates. Said Beg perceiving the Kiahya’s intentions and from his known violent character entertaining some apprehensions for his personal safety and without apprizing any one even of his own family quitted the town and fled with 2 or 3 Georgians towards Mousul, but first most imprudently visited the castle and asked some very improper questions of the officers of the guard. This was enough for the Kiahya who immediately caused his person to be proscribed and seals to be put upon his house and effects, of which a full inventory was ex torted from his secretary. The Kapijilar Kiahyassi (or Military officer next in rank to the Kiahya) was sent with a strong escort in pursuit of him and in a few days intelligence was brought of his having been taken. The most well grounded fears were entertained for his life and the officers of the Police26 were obliged to use uncommon activity to prevent the public expression of the popular discontent. Some Georgians of the place (one of them the Pasha’s seal bearer) were banished, several others sought safety by flight, and a number of circumstances were artfully managed so as to alarm and irritate the Pasha against ^ the unfortunate object of the Kiahya Beg’s jealousy. Things were in this state, when late one evening I was surprised by a visit from Said Beg’s mother who came to throw herself upon the British protection and implore my interposition in behalf of her son who, she said, would certainly be put to death in the Palace where he was to be conveyed privately without passing through the town. I represented to her the extreme delicacy and difficulty of the affair in which the most powerful officers of Government, one of them Said Beg’s brother-in-law, however well they were inclined, durst not interfere. There was, however, no refusing a mother who pleaded for the life of her son, and I was obliged to promise that I would use my most strenuous exertions in his favour. I accord ingly went immediately to the Palace and was admitted to a private audience of the Pasha. I justified my interference on motives of attachment to his person and interests and grounds of real policy, and after a long and earnest conversation in which I found my arguments powerfully assisted by the goodness of his Excellency’s own heart, I succeeded in obtaining the most favourable terms. My negotiation was, however, incomplete until I had conciliated the Kiahya and procured his assent to our agreement. I found this an infinitely more difficult task, but I was ulti mately successful and it was arranged that I was to be present at the Palace on Said Beg’s arrival, to be witness to the treaty that was to be entered into between him and the Government, and guarantee for the performance of it on both parts, and that I was then to take charge of him and conduct him whither I pleased ; I con sidered this as the grand point and quite enough to press at that moment. On the morrow I again visited both the Pasha and the Kiahya when I took measures to secure to the Beg the full possession of his property as before, together with a stipulation for his future liberty and security and a free pardon to servants. I next sent out persons to ascertain the movements of the escort which had charge of the Beg and a confidential man to tranquillize his mind by giving him assur ances of his perfect safety. The next morning was fixed for bringing in of Said Beg, and, as I had promised his mother not to leave him a moment alone with the Kiahya nor lose sight of him till I had safely delivered him over to her, I went to the Kiahya’s palace long before sunrise, and, while waiting for his arrival, a few articles were drawn up with my approbation tending to the future security and confidence of both parties. The Beg was brought to the Kiahya’s palace in a boat, and, after he had written the declaration agreed upon in the margin of a Koran, witnessed by myself and some of the principal officers of the Government, I took him to his Excellency the Pasha, who received him in the kindest manner, and thence conducted him to his own house amidst the shouts of a multitude of spectators, who were rapturous in their expression of affection for the Beg and gratitude to the English Government who had restored him to them. What I felt at that moment would have amply reward ed one for ten times the difficulty and hazard I had encountered in gaining so desirable an object. Indeed the consequences fully justify the measure^and I can confidentlv assert that so great a portion of popularity and reputation could have been acquired by no other means. I must add that the Beg prepared a set of presents to me in arms and jewellery to an enormous amount, but I very fortun ately procured intelligence of his design in time enough to put an entire stop to it. I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, Hon’ble Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, Baghdad ; (Sd.) CLAUDIUS JAMES RICH.

SUMMARY OF EVENTS IN TURKISH TRA]/ FOR THE MONTHS OF MARCH AND APRIL, 1912. I.—Internal Affairs. 1. There are signs at ’ Aqrah of renewed friction between the Turkish authorities * See Summary for December 1910, I, 2. and the Shaikh* of Baraizan. Dr. Wigram of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission at Bibaidi writes as follows to His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal:— • “ For some time past it has been the policy of the Shaikh of Baraizan to depose and turn out the small Aghas from the villages under his rule, specially in the cases where the villages are Christian, and to substitute Wakils of his own, who rule the village, and pay the Shaikh a cer tain percentage of the crops. “ As the Aghas (or their fathers) •mostly established themselves by right of fist, and have ruled very tyrannically, usually imposing corvee on the village for the erection of their small castles, and turning out the owners of the best village lands, one need not waste much sympathy on them. Their rule has resulted in the depopulation of scores of Christian villages in this dis trict, a small number of Kurds who do not cultivate the ground, and pay no taxes, being sub stituted for them. “The policy of the Shaikh, which consists in putting in rulers of the villages who will give the remnants of the Christian population a chance of living, will benefit the Christians, and also, seeing the Christian cultivators work much better than the Kurds, will benefit the Shaikh and ultimately the Government also. ’ Mr. Hony expects that the Shaikh’s policy will be considered objectionable by the Turkish Government, as showing too great independence and local power. 2. The state of the Musal Wilayat leaves something to be desired as regards public security. On March 4th, a caravan was attacked by robbers only some five miles from Musal on the road to Tall Kaif ; two muleteers were killed, and three wounded. Again on the 24th March His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul wrote that the Shammar under ’Ajil-ibn-'Abdul ’Aziz had been raiding within two hours of Musal and that one large landowner was arming his cultivators to enable them to repel the Arabs. The Government appear to be taking no steps. The depredations of the Shammar were restrain- ^ See Summary for April ion, I, i. e q j as fc year, | and they seem determined to make good their “ losses ” by extorting double backmail this season. 3. It appears that the Wali of Baghdad has noK recognised Humaidi-bin- FarhanJ as Shaikh of the Shammar tribe, l^e Summary for October I'.ui I, b probably instead of Hachim-bin-’Asi §who j I was appointed last year. From past ex perience it would seem that the recognition of one Shaikh rather than another is likely to make little practical difference. 4. The official negotiations || with Mahmud Pasha, Jaf, about settling his tribe and granting them special representa- || See last Summary, I, i. bon in the Turkish Chamber seem to have failed. Mahmud Pasha left Musal about the beginning of March and came to Baghdad. It was thought at first that he would be detained there, but he has since been allowed to return to his own coun try. Probably it was considered desirable to consult with/with reference to the Turkish forward policy I) on the Persian y t See ill, n below. frontier. 5. About the beginning of March, according to information received at Bagh dad, an attempt was made by means of the “ Marmaris ' and two small gunboats, accompanied by the Qaim-Maqam of Qurnah as political officer, and supported by a tribal force on land, to deal with ’Abdul Karim-bm-Saihud. The expedition, however, apparently returned to Basrah without having fallen in with the Shaikh. Thisisperhapsonlva version of the patrol** **See laU Summary, arrangements enforced for a time after the last outrage by the Shaikh’s partisans. C 142 FD2 6. Reports are current that things in the Muntafik country are now quieter, and that the new military Mutasarrif, Farid Summary for January 1912,1, 2. Bey * has been very SUC cessful in his new appointment. 7. At a recent visit to Karbala and Najaf, I found those two towns very much improved, but with less of picturesqueness. Some of the Karbala bazaars have been widened, straightened, and raised in height *, and at Najaf the mam bazai has been enlarged into something so spacious as to rival the chief bazaar of Damascus. Jalal Bey, the late Mustasarrif of Karbala and afterwards Wali of Basrah, might have been congratulated heartily on these improvements, but for the manner in which they were carried out. A small part of the old bazaar at Najaf still remains, and the Qaim-Maqam told me that it would not now be interfered with until there was money for the expropriation of the owners legally. The following rhymed Persian epigram on Jalal Bey, which I heard at Karbala, may interest others who have had official dealings with him . Jim-i-jahl o Alif-i-ablalii o Lam-i-lijaj, Har sih dar nam-i-tu jama’ J&amp;lala ; Chih ’ilaj ? “ The J of Jahl (ignorance), the A of Ablahi (=stupidity), and the L of Lijaj (=obstinacy) —all three are contained in thy name, 0 Jalal ! What remedy is' there ? ’ 8. A tour to Najaf has made it possible for me to correlate a number of events? the connection between which was not formerly clear, particularly the sack of o x c * v inn TQ Ja’arah t by Arabs,’Askeri Bey’sJ expedi- t Iz Summary tr oTuXr Itii 1, l] 3. ' tion, and the recent military movement § § See last Summary, I, 5. to Diwaniyah. It seems that some time before the Ja’arah affair, Government deprived the A1 Shibil tribe, who did not pay their revenue regularly, of certain State lands which they held in the Mushkhab tract near Najaf. The lands withdrawn from the A1 Shibil were given instead to one Hasan Agha, son of Farhud of the Bani Zaraij, a tribe whose proper habitat is near Hillah, but whose lands there have been drying up in conse quence of the failure of the Hillah branch of the Euphrates . After Hasan Agha had taken possession of the lands, but before he had paid anything to Government, the A1 Shibil made an attack upon him. and a whole day’s fighting took place ; this was the occasion on which Ja’arah was plundered. The expedition of ’Askari Bey against the A1 Shibil followed, and Hasan Agha was replaced in possession of the disputed lands. At the end of October or beginning of November, the Wali of Baghdad visited the neighbourhood on tour || and realised, II See Summary for October 1911 , II, 5. j t j g £T800 from Hasan Agha on ac count of the lease of the lands. About the beginning of February, however, the A1 Shibil repossessed themselves of part of the lands by force, and Hasan Agha called on the Turks for help. About ten of the Agha’s men were killed on this occasion, and the corpse of oneithem was very barbarously mutilated. The Turkish autho rities on this sent a column to Diwaniyah, as previously reported ; but there was no fighting, and a pacific settlement very favourable to the A1 Shibil was made. By it the tribe recovered two-thirds of the disputed lands while only one-third of it, being the property of’Alaiwi-bin-Rakhaiyis, who would not come in to Askari Bey and who is now an outlaw, was left with Hasan Agha. The latter is now confined to four villages or forts, and it is doubtful whether he will be able to retain even these unless the Turks support him more effectively than hitherto. It is possible, of course, that Hasan Agha undertook to maintain himself without support; and it is open to the Government in any case to cancel his lease and refund the money, which they have taken from him as rent in advance. 9. Two years ago a great find of antiquities was made by Arabs at a place in the Mushkhab tracCmentioned in the preceding pafagraph. I saw some of them at Najaf where they had been brought for sale. The Turkish Government are of course powerless to enforce their laws against traffic in antiquities in the case of outlying Arabs.3 fc j A fresh and very valuable deposit of antiquities seems to have come to light about the end of January at Tall Abu Mukhailah, a place described as situated in the land of Abu Ruwaiji in the Jabur country, at some 20 miles distance from both Diwaniyah and Kufah. Here very lately a fine “ idol ” was found by the ’Awabid and taken from them by violence by the Bani Zaraij. The resulting dispute has been referred by the parties to a theologian at Diwaniyah for settlement according to Muhammadan law : one would have thought that under Shari’at an idol could not be treated as property. 10. The insecurity of the country outside the towns and off the main roads was forcibly brought home to me during a few days’ halt at Kufah lately. I was told that a corpse which passed up the river in the sight of all was that of a man, who had come from Tawairij to revenge the murder of a relation and had himself leen been killed in the attempt. Almost on the same day a fray took place in a village at an hour’s distance and an Arab was killed. When I remarked on these two in cidents to my host, a son of the Kiliddar of Najaf, he immediately mentioned that a nephew of his own had been seriously wounded near Tawairij, only twenty days before. He added that the Government did nothing in these cases beyond issuing summons to court, which nobody thought of obeying. 11. I met at Hillah with the present Qadhi of Diwaniyah named Salih. He informed me that he had arranged for a watercut to be made connecting the great lake of Abu Najm with the old bed of the Euphrates near Diwaniyah r and that this had restored irrigation from the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Diwaniyah, where 16 or 17 oil-engine pumps were now at work. Mr. Cree of Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co. confirms this news generally, and says that the engines and pumps were obtained from his own firm. The Qadhi in question seems to have been also instrumental in getting carriage communication established between Hillah and Diwaniya. If there were more men like him in Mesopotamia, the country would not be so backward ; but his type is rare. II. —Turkish Affairs, Military. 1. The Commander of the 13th Army Corps did not, it seems, travel* down the Euphrates after all. He appears to * See last Summaiyv 1,5. have travelled from Tawairij to Hillah, from Hillah to Diwaniyah and from Diwaniyah to Suwairah on the Tigris. He even tually arrived at Basrah, but whether by steamer on the Tigris or by some less usual route, e.g., the Shatt-al-Gharaf, I do not know. On the 9th March he inspected the fort at Fao. He left Basrah for Baghdad on the 14th March, and arrived at Bagh dad on the 20th along with some troops from Kut,—possibly the column sent to Diwaniyah in the previaus month or part of it. 2. In March there was a quarrel at Musal between As’ad Pasha, the Commander of the 12th Army Corps, and Shamilf Pasha, the Commander of the 35th Division, f Summary for February and March 1911, who V US once As ad Pashas Senior officer. y t i. Shamil Pasha must have departed from a pledge which he took on the Quran before Nazim Pasha to give up intoxicating liquors, for he seems to have been under the influence of drink at the time of this incident. According to information received by His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Musal, Shamil Pasha was placed under arrest, attempted to commit suicide, and was finally sent to Baghdad under medical supervision. Here he is going about freely with other officers and looking much as he did before, only paler. He once had a good name as a soldier in this province, but his military career is now probably at an end. 3. On March 9th His Britannic Majesty’s Consult at Basrah estimated the strength of the Nizam InfantryJ of the 38th t last Summary, Annexure A. Division at 1,280 rifles only, and he included in his estimate time-expired men. This is an even lower figure than that (1,600) which was reported by me to the proper quarter in November last, and it is an inadequate one for a Division consisting of 7 full battalions besides cadre units. On the 22nd March the Basrah garrison consisted of the 38th Nishanji Battalion4 (400 rifles), the bulk of the 1st Battalion of the 112th Regiment (250 rifles), and a Cadre l;nit (100 rifles), total 750 rifles. The small outposts at Zubair, Safwan, Umm Qasr, Vbul Fulus, Fao and Bubiyan near Basrah were then found by the 1st battalion of the 112th Regiment and were included in the figures of the Basrah Garrison. 4. It seems impossible to find out what is being done with the Cadre Units* here, * Se* last Summary H, i. or whether they are skeleton battalions or independent companies. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah mentions only one “ Cadro Buluk ” there, 100 strong, apparently belonging to the 112th Regiment. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal on the other hand, who had previously reported the filling up of a cadre battalion for each of four regiments (104th, 106th, 107th and 108th), now states that there are two “ Cadro Buluks ” to each of these Regiments. This, if correct, shows that the general reorganisation scheme is working out strangely in parts of Turkey. 5.. At Najaf a strange eccentricity of the Turkish military system came to my notice. 1 found ’Abbas, a grandson of the Kiliddar of Najaf, serving as a private soldier in the battalion in garrison there (the 2nd of the 11th Regiment). He is under an engagement to serve 3 months, as a good example to the other young men of Najaf, and he wears uniform and sleeps in barracks ; but, as he informed me with engaging frankness, nothing is required of him in the way of drill out of considera tion for his family. He did not know the number of the regiment or battalion to which he belonged. # 6. A detachment of one company from the battalion at Najaf has been posted at Shamiyah, the headquarters of a Qadha, two or three hours east of Kufah. Men come in from it to Najaf every day to fetch meat and other supplies. The arrangement is likely to be made permanent, and it looks like the beginning of a return to the old system of small dispersed garrisons, which Nazim Pasha tried to abolish two years ago in favour of concentration. , . 7. The present garrison of the Fao fortf is only 20 men, and there are no signs fiSVe Summary for January, II, 5. ^ anything being done to the foru itself. 8. In the Musal Army Corps men, who have completed three years with the colours, have lately been refused their discharge. On the 28th February 120 men of this class were sent to Baneh on the Persian frontier, and a few days later 200 more were despatched in the same direction. This measure was no doubt connect- j See in, n below. ed{ with the forward policy on the frontier. Considerable military activity prevailed in the Musal Army Corps in April. Tents were being ordered, and retired officers and officers of the Rridif were being employed to make good a serious shortage in the commissioned ranks. 9. A military review was held at Baghdad, on the 16th April, of troops returning from some days’ field exercises beyond the Diyalah. The Commander of the Army Corps informed me that there had been a few cases of sunstroke among them. Con suls and other Europeans were invited to be present as the Wall’s private guests. The Commander informed the French Consul that there were about 4,000 men on parade ; but I myself and others, who took the trouble to count them, knew that there were only about 900 infantry, and at the outside 300 other fighting men ! The principal feature of the march past was the transport train, otherwise there was nothing to remark. There are now about 100 military transport carts at Baghdad. 10. On the 27th April some new weaving machinery, which has been installed in the Baghdad Military Clothing Factory (Abakhanah) was inaugurated by the Wall with great pomp in the presence of the principal military officers, the Euro pean Consuls, the newly-elected parliamentary representatives of the V ilayat, and others. The new machines are all of German manufacture. The Commander of the Army Corps, ’Ali Riza Pasha, made a sensible speech in which he estimated that about £. T. 2,000 per annum would be saved by manufacturing locally a large proportion of the material required for the Army Corps.11. I learned lately at Karbala that there are practically no reserves at Kar bala itself, and that the headquarters of the new Karbala Radif Division have al ready been shifted to Hillah. 12. On the 10th February 4,000 old fashioned Mausers were received from Baghdad at Musal for distribution to the Radif centres at Rowanduz, ' Aqrah, Zakho, Dahuk, and Amadiyah. It was probably rifles of this class which were ,. „ , y 1010 TT 0 supplied* to the Karbala Radif Division •See bummary for January 1912, II, 2. J anuar y 13. About the last day of April, a small force marched from Baghdad by night for a destination believed to be Hillah. It consisted of about 180 infantry, taken from two different battalions, with one or two guns. It is said there has been trouble between the Qaim-Maqam of Hillah, who is a military officer and rather venturesome, and the Arabs in the neighbourhood. Civil. 14. At Karbala I went to see the Turkish Government Hospital, of which the . c c . XT i join T r e? foundation was laidt in November 1910. rSee Summary for November 1910, II, 5. Tj- i. u i • i j. i It has been laid out on an enormous scale and consists of one large central block and six other blocks. The roofing has only been begun, and work seems to be lagging. * It is believed that no provision has been made for staff, furniture, instruments, or drugs. The only person to take charge of it at present is the single municipal doctor at Karbala ; “ but of course, ” as'a Karbalai wit remarked to a Turkish official, “ if it is only intended to kill the patients, one doctor will be ample/' I should not be surprised to see the under taking abandoned or the building converted to some other use. 15. A telegram from the Minister of Religious Endowments to the Wali of Baghdad on the 23rd March stated that the Turkish Government had approved J Summary for September 1911, II, 4. a £T.70,000 for the pioposedj great Islamic College at Mu’adhdham. This project is about as likely to be carried to a successful issue as the Karbala hospital scheme. 16. The Wali is establishing a training school for Mudirs at Baghdad. The Mudir is the lowest administrative official holding an independent charge, and so corresponds to the Indian Tahsildar. In accordance with the spirit of the age in Turkey these civil employes are to be taught military drill. 17. When I was at Karbala charge of the Mutassarifik was still temporarily § See last Summary, II, is. held § b &gt;' the head of the Educational Depart- ment from Baghdad. This was Muham mad Rifa’at, a middle-aged, anxious-looking pedagogue with a small son who has learned to speak excellent English in a school at Jerusalem. Since my visit to Karbala Ibrahim Fahim, the substantive Mutasarrif, has arrived there, resigned promptly for reasons as yet unknown, and been relieved by Muhammad Rifa'at. 18. Ibrahim Naji, the new Qaim-Maqam|| of Najaf, is a great contrast to his predecessor ’Aziz Bey, and has earned for |1 See last Summary, in, 5. himself general approbation in a very short time. He belongs to a good Arab family at Baghdad and enjoys an advantage which belongs to few of the higher Turkish officials here, that of understanding the language and the people of the country. 19. The quarantine relaxation^ lately granted at Basrah was qualified by the condition that it should only apply to Tf See last Summary, II, 19. vessels carrying not more than one Indian pilgrim per 100 tons net register. I understand that the difficulty is being simply met by disembarking at Muhammarah, the port immediately before Basrah, any Indian pilgrims in excess of the prescribed numler. 20. The Turkish motorboat service** on the Euphrates is being resumed for the „ * r i ion tt * season without the assistance of a European ** Seg Summary for July 1911, II, 5. . , . t engineer. One of the mechanics sent from Baghdad is a domestic servant, who has received a few days’ training on the motor C 142 FDboat at Baghdad. * See VII, 5, below. A French traveller to Alleppo, M. de Genouillac,* has had the hardihood to take a passage from Fallujah to Maskanah by this line. Political and General. 21. The election^ of deputies to the Turkish Chamber is over in the Baghdad f See last Summary, II, 21 . Wilayat There were great complaints, while the elections lasted, of official pres sure being used to secure the return of Union and Progress candidates. No doubt some pressure was exercised, but it does not seem to have been of an objectionable or extreme kind. Publicly the Liberal Accord party did not succeed in making themselves very conspicuous, but it is a question whether the results of the elections are not really in their favour. The following are the deputies returned for Bagh dad with the number of delegates’ votes which each received : — Saiyid Muhi-ud-Din, Naqibzada, 190; Murad Bey, 185; Fuad Effendi, 182; Sasun Effendi, 162. Of these Murad Effendi, half-brother of the present Minister of War and him self ex-Maktubji of this Wilayat, is undoubtedly a strong Union and Progress man. His opposition! to NazimjPasha will be re- t Summary for November 1910, V, 14. mcm b P red. On the other hand, Saiyid Muhi- ud-Din, who heads the poll, cannot possibly be regarded, though he may be officially described, as a Union and Progress candidate. He is an Arab of the Arabs, he can not speak Turkish, he belongs to a great family which preferred the former regime, and his personal anti-Turkish sentiments are well-known. Sasun Effendi again is an independent at heart, with whatever party he may for the present profess to be connected. One of the two deputies selected for the Karbala-Najf division is Fuad Effendi, Public Prosecutor of Appeal, a Baghdadi and certainly no ardent believer in Union and Progress principles. At Diwaniyah, an easily manageable constituency, a safe seat was found for that flamboyant Union and Progress jour- | See Summary for November 1910, V, 15. nalig( . and e i-Minister§, Isma'll Haqqi' Bey (Babanzadah); Bagdhad, I understand, would have none of him on account of an opinion attributed to him here that Mesopotamia should be placed under an excep tional and presumably rigorous form of government. If the reported successes of the Union and Progress party all over the Empire resemble that obtained at Baghdad, their importance should not be over-estimated. In the Baghdad Wilayat their success amounts to this: that they have been able to secure the election of one or two of their most devoted adherents, while a majority of the seats have gone to candidates, who miy, for the moment, have consented to enter into arrangements with them, but who are really independent if not hostile. In these circumstances, it may easily prove that the power of the Union and Progress party in the Chamber, when assembled, is not on a par with their nominal majority. 22. I have been much struck of late by the increasing freedom with which anti-Committee of Union and Progress and anti-Turkish sentiments are expressed here. Hitherto there was a feeling that opposition to the Committee and to the Turks was treason to the State, but it seems to be making way for a feeling that the Turks and the members of the Committee are only fellow-citizens after all, with whom it is lawful to contend. This growing political confidence of the non-Turkish Muhammadan elements is noticeable even among officials. At Karbala the President of the Bidayat, Shukri Effendi, a Syrian Arab, showed great jealousy and dislike of the Turks in a conversation with me: the subject of a Turco-Arab conflict of interests wasnaturally not of my choosing , and I did not encourage him to pursue it. At *See paragraph is on p. 5 . the Qaim-Maqam * was more cau tious, but he showed disappointment and surprise when I said that I thought the continuance of the party of Union and Progress in power for the present might be the best thing for the country. He blushed, when I asked him at our first interview to what party he himself belonged, and replied “ to the Haqiqiyin ” (the party of Truth). He afterwards gave me to understand that he was an admirer of Lutfi Fikri and Riza Taufiq, the leaders of the Liberal Accord party, and told me that his own candidature at Baghdad as a Liberal Accordist was a probability. It did not take place, however ; but he is now at Baghdad on leave. It was clear also that the eldest son of the Kiliddar of Najaf and ’Abdur Rahman'j* (Pachachizadah), among non- t See viii, i, below. officials, were opposed to the Committee of Union and Progress and welcomed the formation of a new party which would assert Arab interests ; the former is a type of the Arab land-owning class and the latter of the upper Arab merchant community. If political development here follows a normal course, and if the people the country have any real political convictions and courage,—two conditions of which the fulfilment is doubtful,—the support of the Baghdad province wall by and bye be lost to any party which does not concede to the Arabs political equality wdth the Turks. 23. I was informed at Najaf that the Sharif! of Makkah this year, out of friend- 1Summary for February and March 1911, ship*]* for Ibn Rashid, the Amir of Jabal VII, 4. Shammar obliged a body of Hajis, who wished to return in this direction via the Hijaz Railway and Syria to go back by caravan across Najd. Some Hajis also lodged complaints at Madinah against the conduct of the Amir's pilgrim agent towards them; but they were told by the Turkish authorities that this was a matter pertaining to the Sharif in which the Turkish courts could not interefere. 24.

Nationalist re-occupation of the Sharaf-ul-Mulk was not killed in at Baghdad during February about events at Kirmanshah proves to have been on the whole correct; but the date of the town was 7th not 9th February, and the battle but shot by the Nationalists in the course of an altercation. The Baghdad rumours of the recovery of Kirmanshah by the Salar-ud-Daulah and of the plunder of merchants' goods were also true ; the former took place on the 22nd February and cost altogether about 400 lives. The looting was mostly done by the Kalhurs—Dawud Khan's tribe—who had taken little part in the fighting; and foreign subjects were not always respected. Two troopers of the Turkish Consular Guard were stripped in the street, and an Indian sowar on duty at the British Consulate was shot through the arm by a passing Kalhur. Severe reprisals were made by the Salar, after his success, on the opposite party ; among his victims were the Nationalist Governor of Kirmanshah-— the A'zam-ud-Daulah—and his son, other officials and officers, and about 30 private Nationalist soldiers, all of whom were captured and put to death. The Salar- ud-Daulah, after his victory, proceeded to levy forced contributions on merchants of the place, some of them very heavy, and soon gave the towns-people cause to regret having turned against the Nationalists and admitted him once more8 within their walls. The damage done to trade by the disorders at his entering the town, and by his own exactions after occupying it, will cripple the merchants of the place, it is calculated, for two years. On the 12th March certain proposals, and on the 6th April a warning, were conveyed to the Salar by the British and Russian Consuls at Kirmanshah under orders from their respective Legations. From the Salar’s replies it appeared that he aimed at the throne of Persia for himself or hoped at least to establish a semi-independent kingdom in Western Persia. On the 8th of April he left Kir manshah for Harunabad, in the direction of Kirind, apparently to collect recruits for the coming struggle with the Nationalists, who were expected shortly to ad vance against him from the north. His own force was only about 500 men. I have been again for a short time in correspondence with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah, and the above corrections and new facts are taken from his letters, the last of which is dated 9th April. While the Salar was at Kirmanshah, the road * between last Summary, m, 2. Baghdad and that place was open again: now it seems to be once more closed. According to more recent information received at Baghdad from another source, the Salar has since been seen at Gilan, a place only two day’s march from Mandali in Turkish territory. , * 'll 4 * I ;j j 2. The Mujallal-as-Sultan took part with the Salar-ud-Daulah in the recap ture of Kirmanshah by the Royalists on the 22nd February ; but by the 9th April he was at Sinnah with 50 mounted men from the ex-Shah’s army and was threatening an attack on Hamadan, which was then held by the Nationalists with a weak garrison, 3. The Mujtahidf conclave on Persian political affairs remained in session during the whole of March. It now seems t -See last Summary, ill, 4. that the gathering was organised by a restless politician named Shaikh ’Ali of Karbala, and that the Mujtakids them selves were by no means enthusiastic about the programme which he arranged for them. (Shaikh ’Ah is the leading opponent of the reorganisation of the Oudh Bequest; his brother Shaikh Husain, Mujtahid, is one of the former corrupt distributors and has not yet accepted the new arrangements, though he has been invited to do so ; and Shaikh ’Ali himself is known to have done his best to stir up the suspicions of the Turks on the subject of the Bequest). Once the Mujtahids had assembled at Kazimain they were ashamed to disperse without the occurrence of some satisfactory change in the Persian political situation for which they could claim credit. About the beginning of March they began to receive numerous letters from Persia urging them to desist from their political interference, which seemed not to be productive of any good ; and the course of events at Kirmanshah added to their embarrasment. On the 11th March the Salar-i-Ijlas, a brother of the A’zam-ud-Dauleh, the Nationalist Governor of Kirmanshah, executed by the Royalists, held a “ Fatihah ” service at Kazimain, where he is residing, in connection with his brother’s death. Shaikh ’Abdullah (Mazandarani), the doyen of the Mujtahids at Kazimain, was present; but this did not prevent the Salar’s inveighing against the Mujtahids’ policy as destructive to Persia. He said that his grandfather had been summoned to Tehran and killed there by the Constitu tionalists, and now his brother and nephew had perished at the hands of the Royalists. He also blamed the Mujtahids for the death of the SharaKul-Mulk at Kirmanshah, who, he said, was a good man though a Sunni, and the vengeance of whose tribe would cause endless slaughter in Persia. The Mujtahids should either devise some means of preventing the further effusion of blood in Persia, or else they should abstain from meddling in politics altogether. The Mujtahid Shaikh ’Abdullah made no rejoinder to the Salar-i-Ijlas’s attack. On the 13th March the Nationalists at Kazimain generally convened another “ Fatihah ” meeting for the death of the A’zam-ud-DauIeh. This led to grumb ling among the Persians of the place because no ‘ ‘ Fatihah ’ ’ was held in honour of the Mullas put to death at Kirmanshah by the Nationalists ; and, towards evening, feeling and argument waxed so hot that an actual disturbance was ap prehended.Finally, on the 23rd of March, the Mujtahids gathered at Kazimain received, through the Persian Consul-General at Baghdad, a telegram from the officials and notabilities of Tehran in consequence of which they all, except Saiyid Isma’il (Sadr) of Karbala and Mirza Muhammad Taqi of Samarra, immediately dispersed, nothing loath, to their homes. The Sadr has since gone home also. The tele gram was t j the effect that the ex-Shah had left Persian soil; that Russia and Britain had renounced their aggressive intentions ; that a sufficient force was being despatched from Tehran to Kirmanshah ; that all Persians were deeply indebted to the Mujtahids for their patriotic efforts ; and that it was unnecessary for the Mujtahids to remain longer at a distance from their homes or to trouble themselves any further, unless by addressing an exhortation to the tribes of Persia to keep quiet. 4. Besides the manifesto * of Mirza Muhammad Taqi, two other political f documents are current which were issued . * See last Summary, HI, 4. ^ members of the Kazimain conclave about the middle of February. The author of one, dated 14th February, is Shaikh Fath-Ullah of Najaf, a distributor under the Oudh Bequest; in it he analyses the means by which Muhammadans of the present day are being seduced from their faith and the practice of their religion by foreigners. Among the causes of their falling away, he includes the associating of Europeans with Muslims and their treating them with kindness, always showing them the brighter side of their nature and so drawing their hearts to them, especially the hearts of the ignorant who form a majority. 5 ’ The Shaikh concludes with the usual appeal for Islamic unity. The second paper is a pamphlet published about the 17th February ; it begins with an exhortation to Muhammadan unity by Shaikh ’Abdullah (Mazanda- rani) of Najaf, an Oudh Bequest distributor. It urges that, as Italy is attacking Turkey and Russia Persia, while the other infidel Powers remain spectators and therefore probably sympathise with the aggressor, all Muslim should combine in the defence of their common interests. The Shaikh’s exhortation is followed by short supporting articles from 15 other Mujtahids or Mullas. At the end comes a long and fervent anonymous appeal to Muhammadan feeling, in which the British Empire is quoted as the paramount example of the benefits of unity, and the Jews as an instance of the evil consequences of disunion. The anonymous writer attacks the luxury of the present age among Muhammadans saying: ‘‘ The soldiers of Islam did not eat 'pilao, nor drink tea, nor smoke opium, nor take wine, and thus they carried the colours of Islam to the confines of China and Vienna but he ends by advising all Persians to subscribe to the construction of a railway from Mashhad to Khanaqin. It is impossible not to feel for the exponents of by-gone systems of politics and religion who seem conscious that their principles are doomed, even among their fellow-counrymen. Pan-Islamic sentiment has been tested, as ne\er before, by the simultaneous humiliation of Turkey and Persia ; and it has failed to respond effec tively even to such a supreme stimulus. The response indeed has been unexpect edly feeble, even in the eyes of those who looked for but little. The crescentading spirit with all that it connotes seems to be dead ; the voice of the Sunni Mulla and the Shi’ah Mujtahid are ceasing to command attention ; and even Asiatic Muham madan politics appear to be settling down gradually on other bases than those of religion. • 5 On the 10th March the Amir | Afkham and his party, including Saiyid Akbar Shah, were brought to Kasimain under a t See last Summary, in, 3. guard. On the 11th they were removed to Baghdad except Saiyid Akbar Shah, who was allowed as he pleaded illness to re main at Kazimain under surveillance. It seems to have been suggested to the Amir Afkham that he should appeal to the British Consulate-General for assistance, but he did not do so. On the 13th the Amir Afkham was deported, by steamer, to the destination of Basrah, under charge of a police agent and a gendarme. It was understood that he would be allowed to proceed from Basrah to Muhammarah. 6. Late on the night of the 12th March a son of A’la-ud-Dauleh with two other persons, said to be fugitive Persian princes, and 35 followers, arm ed at Kaznnam. C 142 FD7. Towards the end of April the Amin-ul-Mamalik, a Kirmanshah chief now in asylum at Kazimain, was said to have received a letter from the Farman-Farma, Nationalist Governor-designate of Kirmanshah, urging him to try and detach Dawud Khan (Kalhur) from the Salar-ud-Dauleh. The letter stated that the Farman- Farma was moving on Kirmanshah with a force and wished the Amin-ul-Mamalik to join him. 8. On the 13th April the rtimad-ul-Islam (Shirazi), a Mujtahid, who left Persia 6 or 7 months ago and has since been living at Karbala, approached me through the son of Saiyid Muhammad (Kashi), Mujtahid, one of the Oudh Bequest distributors. He represented that he had fled from Persia for fear of the Bakhtiyaris; that even at Karbala he did not feel safe from them ; that he was a man of influence, with many followers at Shiraz ; and that he desired to obtain British protection. He was informed in polite terms that British subjects are born, not made ; and that there is no artificial means of acquiring British nationality. 9. On the 12th March Ghulam Shah Khan, a younger son of Ghulam Biza * See Summary for January, III, 3. Khan,* the present Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh, arrived at Kazimain with 50 or 60 followers, ibome ot his part\ were females, and he was said to have come on pilgrimage. He is a youth of 22 or 23 years of age. His elder brother Aman-Ullah Khan is gene- rally in rebellion against their father, the Wali. On the 9th April he sent a message to me through a leading Indian gentleman hereto the effect that he had not yet had any communication with the Wali of Baghdad or the Russian Consul-General, and that he wished to know whether he could obtain British protection. I replied that I feared that what he wished was impossible, but that, m any case, it was to the British representatives in Persia that his request should be addressed. 10. No British travellers have passed over the Persian section of the Baghdad- Kirmanshah load since July last, when Lieutenant A. T. Wilsonj' came down from f See Summary for July 1911 , vi 5 . Kirmanshah to Baghdad. 1 owards the end • i . . _ . . ’ . . °f April 1912 Mr. Dewar-Durie of the Im- peria Bank of Persia with his wife and child, also Sarfaraz Husain, an Indian bub-Assistant Surgeon posted to the British Consulate at Kirmanshah and accom panied by ms family, were at Baghdad waiting for an opportunity to proceed to Kirmanshah. hortunately Mr. Soane,J the British Vice-Consul for Qasr-i-Shirin t See VI, 9, below. was leaving Baghdad about the same time £ , .. . , . an d kindly undertook to do what he could to forward them safely on their way from Khanaqin. 11. From a Baghdad standpoint the most important question in connection with the present troubles in Persia is the manner in which the Turkish Government may seev to turn them to account. There is no doubt that there are strong partisans among the ofncials here of a forward Turkish policy, and their views are probably shared by at least some of the high officials at Constantinople. The extension of Turkey eastwards could be pointed to by Turkish patriots as a proof that Turkey is not decadent though she may have lost a province in Africa. the situation on the Baghdad border is rather obscure, and with the means at disposal it is difficult to clear it up. It is complicated by its relation to two distinct matters,- the Turco-I ersian boundary dispute and the present insecurity of the Khanaqin-Kirmanshah road. It seems that about the beginning of February the Turks ^occupied Merivan, a place some 20 miles north-north-east of Gulambar (Turkish) and 50 miles west- non h-west of Sinnah (Persian). 1 his circumstance onlv came to my knowledge after the middle of April, and my Russian colleague learned it for the first time through me - f ha\e since then heard that about the end of February the Committee of T nion and Progress at Baghdad received special information that Sardasht and Ban eh “ belonging to Persia ” had been incorporated with the Ottoman Empire, attached to the Sulaimaniyah Sanjaq, and provided with Mamurs, and that some other “ Persian ” villages—of which Merivan may very well have been one—had also been annexed. The news of the occupation of Merivan was given me at C- Baghdad on the 16th April by Mr. Soane, British Vice-Consul for Qasr-i-Shirin,fl I 11 ► who further said that he had good reason to believe that the Turks had now an administrative Mudir at Merivan. Mr. Soane informed me that the people of Mem an and the districts to the south of it were Sunnis, that those of Sinnah were- mostly Sunnis also, and that the line was, therefore, a. favourable one for a Turkish advance. My Russian colleague's views had hitherto been that the Turks intended to claim the 46th nieridian of east longitude as their boundary with Persia, except upon Lake Lrumiyah ; but Merivan lies decided to the east of that meridian. Having dealt with the circumstances which appear to be cefonected rather with the boundary dispute, we have next to consider those which relate, ostensibly at least , to the protection of the Khanaqin-Kirmanshah road. 1 cannot discover with any certainty what the Turkish troops on the Khanaqin ' „ . . i a c. frontier at present are. At the end of Feb- * tfee Annexure A to last Summary. ir-i i e ruary* the 3rd and 5th squadrons of the 31st Cavalry Regiment at Baghdad were under orders for Khanaqin, and part of the 2nd Squadron of the 32ncl w r ere expected to be sent to Kirmanshah, which would involve their passing through Khanaqin. One Frontier Company of infantry had been despatched to Khanaqin, and another* was about to be sent, or had been sent, to Badrah. There was also a report that the 2nd Battalion of the 112th (In fantry) Regiment was at Khanaqin ; but, as this unit belongs to the Basrah Army Corps and was not known to have passed through Baghdad, the statement w 7 as not credited. On the 21st March 20 men of the 31st Cavalry Regiment left Bagh dad for Khanaqin, and besides this I have had no specific information of the depar ture of fresh troops for the frontier. On the 10th April, however, the Superin tendent of Customs at Baghdad informed me in a private conversation that “ a battalion ” had been sent to the frontier for the purpose of escorting caravans as far as Hamadan in Persia. But, on the 13th April, when Mr. Soane passed through Khanaqin, he only met 175 Turkish cavalry in the neighbourhood of Khanaqin and found the place itself altogether empty of troops. On the 4th March I telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople that the local government of Baghdad were being pressed by native merchants to afford military protection to their caravans on Persian soil as far as v Kirmanshah, and I ventured to suggest that the project need not be opposed, provided it were a temporary measure only and were not made a stepping stone to annexation of territory, the present loss to traders from the insecurity of the roads being undoubtedly enormous. His Excellency replied on the 5th March that I should convey to the Wali, but only as coming from myself, the British view that patience should be exercised in the matter and an opportunity allowed to Persia of organising an efficient gendarmerie. I accordingly interviewed the Wali privately on the 6th of March. He admitted that he was being urged to supply military escorts as far as Kirmanshah, but said it w*as impossible that he should entertain the pro posal as a large force would be required for the protection of the road. Besides, the Turkish troops might be fired upon, and this would mean a war beyond the frontier. As I foresaw it was likely, he asked me why we should object to the use of Turkish troops on the Khanaqin-Kirmanshah line when w*e had troops of our own along the road from Bushehr to Shiraz and Isfahan. I w~as ready w r ith my answer, w hich was that to the best of my belief the British troops in South Persia v*ere not utilised to keep roads open or to protect trade, but only as Con sulate guards and as escorts for British travellers. I indicated that the British policy in Persia, so far as I could see, was to secure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Persia and the organisation of an efficient Persian gendarmerie ; and that the success of this very laudable policy would be endangered, especially in the north, if foreign Powers made arrangements for protecting the roads in any of the Persain provinces by means of their ow r n troops. Up to this point there had been no talk at Baghdad of territorial aggression by the Turks in the direction of Kirmanshah, but, on the 13th March, strange rumours began to circulate at Kazimain. It was said that the Mujtahidsjt Kaziniain had empowered the Turkish Government by a written deed to take possession of the countrv up to Hamadan, r.rd that the Wali had reported the offer by telegram to Constantinople, It was added that two or three days previously a Turkish detach ment of 60 men had advanced beyond Qasr-i-Shirin and had been, fired on, two* of them being killed. It is not to be supposed that such an incident as the lastcould have occurred without coming to the knowledge of the British Vice-Consul for Qasr-i-Shirin or His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah ; and this detracts from the probability of the associated rumour as to the Mujtahids having pretend ed to sign away a Persian province in favour of the Porte. At most it is pos sible that they expressed some opinion not inconsistent with the temporary pro tection of the Kirmanshah road by Turkish agency. Nevertheless, after this time, there was constant talk at Baghdad of Turkish movements on a large scale to be undertaken beyond the Persian frontier. On the 13th of April, as already mentioned, Mr. Soane saw a body of Turkish cavalry near Khanaqin ; they were about 15 miles from that place and were proceed ing on the road to Sulaimaniyah. A Turkish officer informed Mr. Soane quite openly that this detachment was going to join in a large cavalry concentration at Sulaimaniyah, and that the ultimate objective was Sinnah. Mr. Soane gave me the news at Baghdad on the 16th April, along with that relating to the occupation of Merivan by the Turks, and I asked him to confer with Mr. Orloff, the Bussian Consul-General, on both subjects, which he immediately did. Mr. Orloff seems to have telegraphed the intelligence to the Russian Embassy at Constantinople on the same day, but I deferred telegraphing to His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador until I had seen Mr. Soane again and learned the result of his conference with Mr. Orloff. On the 18th April I received a telegram from Sir Gerard Lowther enquir ing whether the information supplied to the Russian Embassy were correct: his telegram crossed one of the 17th from me giving him the same information in fuller detail, to which I ventured to refer him. I ventured to suggest that, in regard to the truth of the facts alleged, a reference might be made to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah. On the 19th April the Wali happened to call on me, and I took the opportunity of asking him about the rumoured occupation of Merivan and concentration of a Turkish cavalry force at Sulaimaniayh with the supposed object of advancing on Sinnah. He replied that he had no information in regard to the appointment of a Turkish Mudir at Merivan, which adjoined the Musal Wilayat, but he was not in a position to deny authoritatively that Merivan had been occupied. As regards Sinnah, he said that no doubt 1 was aware of the Turkish Consulate at Sinnah having been attacked—I was not aware of it as a matter of fact, except from his telling me, until I saw the news later in a Constantinople newspaper—and that it had been considered necessary to send a guard of 30 men there. Consequently, he continued, the military authorities had without any reference to him transferred 100 cavalry from Khanaqin to the northward, but that he had protested that the men were required at Khanaqin for the protection of the frontier there, where there had been raids, and that they would shortly return to their station. I did not think it necessary to remark that Mr. Soane had seen 175 men, not 100, on the way to Sulaimaniyah ; nor that the necessity of displacing even 100 men was not apparent when a guard of 30 only had to be furnished ; nor that according to Mr. Soane’s information there was already a Turkish Consular^Guard at Sinnah, My Russian colleague and I made enquiries and found that there had, as a matter of fact, been a raid, on or about the 17th April, on an estate called Haruniyah in Turkish territory to the east of Ba’qubah ; two men had been killed and two horses stolen ; and the depredators were 20 or 25 horsemen, partly Bani Wais, malcontent Turkish subjects, and partly Kalhurs from beyond the border. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah has also mentioned a raid in Turkish territory, apparently in March, by Guran from Persia, adding that compensation was paid at Khanaqin for the mischief done. I lost no time in reporting the Wali’s remarks to His Britannic Majesty’s Am bassador at Constantinople, with the suggestion that Mr. Soane might be authorised to visit Merivan and Sinnah to ascertain the true state of affairs. I have since learned that the cavalry detachment removed from Khanaquin, or a part of it has returned there. Mr. McDoual wrote as follows, on the 26th March, about the Turkish Consular guard at Kirmanshah:— “ The escort of the Turkish Consul has been increased to 50 men. The Turkish Consul has now informed Salar-ud-Dauleh that two parties of Turkish soldiers are coming to Kirman- shab and Qasr-i-Shirin to protect Turkish subjects.13 The Prince hns replied that he cannot* permit it r.nd requested the Consul to send the .°&gt;0 * Compare Summary for January, III, 5. men recently arrived away. They were permitted ^ T . ' to corr ^ »n escort to a Turkish official, who did not come. If they cross the frontier the guards will attack them. He has sent urgent orders to the Sinjabi and Guran chiefs not to allow the Turks to enter 1 ersir n territory. These are both very war-like tribes and different from the Kahurs whose numbers are thejr advantage. ” The Wali of Baghdad informed me officially, on the last day of April, that he was starting the next day on a tour to “ Ba’qubah, Mandali, etc.” He had already told me privately of his intentions, adding that he would strike the Tigris at Kut visit Basrah, and probably return by the lower Euphrates. From reports by His Britannic Majesty s Consul at Basrah, it would seem that the Turks are now moving actively in connection with the definition of their frontier with Persia between Arnarah and JVIuhammarah, and that a movement forward to the iune which they claim seems to be intended. J ^ At Mandali the \\ ali of Baghdad will be only 40 miles from Gilan, where the Salar-ud-Douleh was lately, and perhaps still, is, and he may attempt to enter into some arrangement with him. The position is disquieting and calls for careful watching. It seems that the Turks cherish great designs on this border, but are hesitating as to the possibility or means of carrying them out. IV. —Central Arabian Affairs. 1. The following appeared on the 20th March in the Baghdad newspaper u Riyadh, the manager of which has, as might be guessed from its name, soipe connection with Southern Central Arabia :— “ An Englishman has left Kuwait as a traveller and gone to Najd for the purpose of seeing the country and discovering mines and antiquities and other things in which the British ane interested. He has two guides, one of whom is named ’Uthaimm and will be paid £ T. 150. We hope that ’Abdul ’Aziz Pasha-as-Sa’ud will exclude foreigners from his country as his pre decessors and ancestors did and protected it againrt all evil and harm. ” Possibly this paragraph refers to M. Raunkiaer, a Danish naturalist and ex plorer working under the auspices of the Danish Geographical Society, who left Kuwait for Najd about the end of February last. 2. It is stated that 18 boys from the dominions of Ibn Sa’ud have been admitted, or offered admittance, to the Turkish Normal School at Baghdad. The Turkish Government has undertaken to pay for their maintenance, while they are studying here. 3. According to a letter from Nasiriyah Ibn Rashid, lately came down from Najd to Khamisiyah, near Suq-ash-Shuyukh, for the sake of making purchases. Some of his chiefs at home seem to have urged him to return to Jabal Shammar ; and his presence near Khamisiyah was resented by certain of the neighbouring tribes, among them the Dhafir and Khaza’il. The Amir, after having in vain assured the local tribes of his pacific intentions, found himself obliged to assume the offensive and defeated them thoroughly, taking many camels and much property and capturing 3 Shaikhs of the Dhafir. These events occurred in March. After their defeat some of the local tribes, who are Turkish subjects, began to pay their taxes to the Ottoman Government, which they had not done before. Among these were the Budur and the Abu 'Adhim. It is believed that the letter containing the above statements was written with the express object of induing the Turkish authorities to recommend an increase in the subsidy paid by the Porte to Ibn Rashid. V. —British Cases and Interests. 1. The British Indian subject Saiyid, Muhammadf has now been acquitted by a Turkish tribunal on the criminal charge, t .S ee Summary or anuary , 2 . which was the original cause of his wrongful arrest and maltreatment by the Turkish police authorities in 1910. This result following as it does at a short interval on the punishment of the offending police by a Turkish court, should justify, even in the eyes of the Turkish Government the British demand made in the case. C142FD14 2. I am glad to be able to report that, Messrs ’Abdul ’ All’s claim for £.T.228 agairst the Turkish Government on account of interference with their sale of ice in 1910, has now been settled. 3. After the middle of March the permission granted to the Euphrates and ^ Tigris Steam Navigation, Company, Limited, to tow a second barge with each of their steamers, was suddenly withdrawn. The concession was granted for the purpose of enabling the company to work off an accumulation of 3,800 tons of cargo, but at the time of withdrawal of the permission only 1,568 tons had been transported by the extra barge. It does not’follow, however, that the entire balance of the accumulation remained uncleared off. The Wali of Baghdad telegraphed pri vately to the Minister of Finance on the 18th and 23rd of March, representing that a Muhammadan exporting merchant and Turkish subject would be hard hit if the i prohibition of the second barge were maintained, but without result. The merchant in question was undoubtedly ’Abdul Qadir Pasha (Khadhairi), the Wall’s virtual landlord; and it is probable that the Wali went so far as he dared in the matter, though not out of sympathy with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople having consi dered that the circumstances did not warrant his pressing the matter, the second barge remains for the present withdrawn. There are two sides to this question, even from the British point of view. Since the beginning of the present British mail contract in 1904, the Company- have been enabled, by the strenuous support of the British Government, to increase the number of their steamers from two to three, the advantage of towing one barge per steamer has been maintained in their favour, and they have enjoyed for a time that of towing two barges per steamer. The Company seem imperfectly conscious of the extent of their obligations to Government. The second barge, when permitted, is, I understand, a positive obstacle to the rapid carriage of His Majesty’s mails. It is probable that the profits of the Company from the advan tages which have been secured or maintained for them since, by official British support, are considerably, more valuable than the mail subsidy which was fixed wdien their affairs -were in a less flourishing condition than at present. Never theless, much hesitation is manifested by them when measures are suggested for avoiding delay in the carriage of the British mails. I am inclined to think that the above facts should be taken into consideration when a fresh mail contract falls to be arranged in 1914. It might be endeavoured, for example, to arrange that no subsidy should be paid as long as the company are permitted to use three steamers with two barges each, that a certain propor tion should be paid them when their carrying facilities are reduced below this maxi mum, and that the present full subsidy should be maintained only in case of their reverting to the less favourable conditions obtaining in 1904 when the present contract was made. 4. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah has no doubt reported to Govern ment the circumstances of a collision between the Euphrates and Tigris S. N. Company’s steamer ‘‘Bulbul’’, towing a barge with material for the Hindiyah Barrage, and a launch flying the Eussian flag. The latter w T ent to the bottom, two Arabs were drowned, and the baggage of certain Arab Shaikhs was lost. The incident has necessitated r. journey to Basrah by Mr. Tod, the Company’s principal manager in Mesopotamia. 5. On a tour to Karbala in March, I spent two nights at the Hindiyah Bar rage* as the guest of Mr. Warbrick, the engineer in charge. This fine work is not a very large one and is remark- * See last Summary, 6. a ble for its height (20 metres) rather than for its length (only 240 metres). The foundation is of solid cement; and the massive superstructure is of brick masonry, stone being unobtain able except at a prohibitive price. About the half of the whole work has been finishe d, and it is calculated that (accidents exceed) the remainder can be completed in a year’s time or rather more. The foundations of the head of the new Hillah Branch are ready. Between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 bricks are already in place, and about 10,000,000 will^be used from the first to last. The brickfield, which can turn out 60,000 bricks per week, is consequently one'of the chief features of the works. The country has been denuded of natural fuel, and the bricks are now being burned with coal imported from Britain by the Euphrates. At the time of my visit there were about 2,500 Arabs employed on the works, and I never saw Arabs work so quietly or diligently as these did. Organisation and fair treatment have worked marvels. The engineers assured me that native labour is already cheaper, in relation to its efficiency, than in Egypt. A useful class of native foremen has already come into existence. The wages paid are high, according to previous standards, even children earning as much as four I pence and five pence a day; but the return is satisfactory. There is an excellent hospital on the works, under the charge of a European doctor, capable of receiving both European and Native employes. Tw r o Turkish engineers are employed in the drawing office. The works afford a remarkable display of tactful extemporisation, good discipline, and modern machinery. I am concerned to find that a large proportion of the land 'lying nearest to $ the Barrage are owned by private individuals. Such lands are' almost neces sarily less profitable to the State, when brought under irrigation by a Govern ment work, than State domains; besides which the exploitation is not effectively in the hands of the Government or its advisers. Thus opposite to Babylon the land belongs to Grabet, a native Christian, about Mahannawdyah, which is mid- wav between Babylon and the Barrage to the west of the Hillah Branch, and in the direction of the Barrage, it is owned by the Naqib of Baghdad and his family and a Jewish group headed by Mr. Manahim Salih Daniel in proportions of one-third and tw’o-thirds, respectively; to the east of Mahannawiyah, on the other side of the Hillah Branch, it belongs to Abu Mustafa of Baghdad; and so on. On the march from Kifl to Hillah I traversed lands belonging to Mr. M. S. Daniel, ‘the Qazvini,’ and ‘the KaraidT. It is possible, however, that Indian associations have prejudiced me unduly against large landed proprietors, and- that in this country such may even prove more useful to the Government than intractable individual cultivators who are uncivilised Arabs; and in any case I was assured, in various places, that large tracts of unbespoken Government lands lay at no great distance off. After visiting the Barrage I thought it well to write privately to Sir John Jackson and point out to him that the construction of the main works, on w’hich his atten tion is at present concentrated, is only half the economic battle; and that the distribution of water and the colonisation of the lands will remain as problems, to be solved, when the main works are finished, before there can be any adequate return to capital. I have sent copies of this letter to the Government of India, the Government of the Punjab, and His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople for information. It is to be hoped that the permanent con tractors will be Sir John Jackson, Limited, wffio have already got the current enter prise well in hand; and it is only the permanent contractors who can be expected to realise and bring home to the Turkish Government the requirements of the situation. More than two years’ residence in a Turkish province have rendered f me perhaps unnecessarily pessimistic ; but I begin to apprehend a most disappoint ing check if the main works should be finished without thought having been * administration. Ezra Effendi, the son of Mr. Manahim Salih Daniel, has returned* from India. He visited the Chenab colony and was given every facility for seeing and learning. irrigation engineer and the degree to which that officer is accessible to the meanest cultivator and ready to explain and justify the orders he gives. Ezra Effendi was greatly impressed by the care taken in the Punjab to prevent the wasteful use of water—a vice to which, he says, the Arab cultivator, if not restrained, is just as prone as the Indian. There is no doubt that through Ezra Effendi a successful appeal in favour of British methods has been made to his father, a representative of one gf the greatest landed interests—probably the greatest—in Mesopotamia. *See last Summary, V, 7. What astonished him most, I think, was the professional enthusiasm of the Punjab16 6. On tour I was the guest at Karbala of Afzal Khan, the local agricul tural manager of the Qizilbash family of Lahore (India), and had an opportunity of studying the Capabilities of their magnificent estate of many thousands of acres near Karbala. If I am not misataken the new Hindiyah Barrage will raise the level of the water in the Husainiyah Canal by about two metres and convert these lands, of which at present only a few hundred acres are irrigated with doubt ful profit, into a veritable gold mine. The local Turkish officials are still bent on an old scheme of saddling these Qizilbash proprietors, most unjustly, with a large proportion of the recurring expense of protecting Karbala against floods, floods which do not originate in their lands, which in fact frequently devastate their property, and which the Turkish Department of Public Works could, by the expenditure of a comparatively small sum, put an end to for ever. I have reported on this question before in * See my letter No. 186 to the Government of a , s P e&lt;:ial memorandum*. I was sorry to learn India and despatch No. 185-8 to His Britannic that there is a boundary dispute, involving Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople, dated hundreds of acres of future fine land, bet- ioth March 1911 . ween the Qizilbash family and some neigh bouring proprietors who are Turkish subjects. The enormous enhancement of values, now impending, may soon render such differences unadjustable by friendly agreement. There is also a difficulty, probably of less importance, regarding a main water channel from the Husainiyah Canal, which Afzal Khan states was constructed entirely by himself, and to a share in which a neighbour now lays claim. I have written privately to the Qizilbash Nawab of Lahore, with whom I am personally acquainted, suggesting that he would be wise to revisit this country at no distant date and take stock of the new situation which is arising. 7. There is now a good Indian school at Karbala, which was founded about two years ago and has been maintained up to the present time by the voluntary subscriptions of Indians. Its existence first came to my knowledge about a year ago, and I saw it for the first time on a recent tour to Karbala in March. There are over 100 pupils, mostly Indian orphans; and ordinarily the masters are four in number. Hindustani, Persian, Arabic and English are taught, besides other ordinary school subjects and drill. The boys look happy and intelligent, and discipline and good order prevail. Altogether the school makes a bright spot in the moral gloom of the town. Education in the school is altogether free, even stationery, books, etc, being supplied to the pupils gratis. On the 16th of March a prize distribution was arranged by the Managing Committee, at which an excel lent little programme of songs and addresses was gone through, and my wife presented the prizes. As an instance of self-help on the part of the Indian community at Karbala this school is remarkable. The Karbala Committee of the Oudh Bequest have now decided to grant it a small subsidy so long as its work is satisfactorily carried on, and during my visit to Karbala a considerable sum was collected for it in extra ordinary subscriptions, which was banked and will assure its financial position for some time to come. Efforts are being made to find a good English teacher, and a suggestion on my part that Turkish should be added to the curriculum was well received. Pro mising Indian boys, who receive their first education in the Karbala school, might be sent, hereafter, to continue their studies in the Church Missionary Soc^lby’s school at Baghdad, where they would be taught Engish and Turkish thoroughly and so qualfied for official employment. It would be a great advantage if this Residency, and the British Vice-Consulates under its superintedence at Karbala and Musal, could be staffed entirely with local British subjects, which is not the case at present. 8. The Church Missionary Society have not yet obtained official permission to build their new hospital at Baghdad on the land which they acquiredf last u 1nll year ; but the early grant of a Farman now Tin 6 Um “ ar&gt; rya seems Probable. The local acting head of the Slission (the Rev. Mr. Boyes) has now accepted, on behalf of the Society, the condition insisted on by the Porte which^ P r j nci P al obstacle to a settlement, viz., that the Mission shall pay taxes o e land and buildings, as well as cusloms duty on any building materials im ported. His acceptance is qualified by a proviso that the taxes shall be regularly mi pose an not excessive in amount; and. in reporting it to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, I have noted that it is understood that the present demands of the Porte in connection with the Farrran are final and will not be followed by others. ^ r ' Stanle y’, fora f r ly one of the Church Missionary Society’s doctors at Baghdad, was transferred to Musal early in March. He has re-opened the Society’s hospital there, which had been closed * for some time, and his services were Summary for February and March 1911 , immediately in great request. His arrival J/ 11, 6 \ i • x • t* • • i was b a iled with delight by all classes except those belonging to the anti-British (that is French and Koman Catholic) party. 10. On the 22nd of March the Mission House of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission at Bibaidi was entered by thieves and a horse stolen. His Britannic Ma jesty s \ice-Consul at Musal at once took the appropriate official steps. 11. At Baghdad, where the present Wali has not been very successful in con trolling the bad characters, the houses of two British subjects have lately been entered by burglars. J In the first case, at the beginning of April, Mr. Davis, of Messrs. McAndrews and Forbes Company, returning at 8-p. m. to his house, which he had left locked up, found a man emerging from it and grappled with but did not succeed in detain ing him. The rooms had been ransacked, a lamp lighted, and a number of things placed together for removal. Again, in the early morning of the 23rd April, two burglars escaping from a neighbouring house passed through that of Mr. M. G. Thaddeus, the Accountant of this Residency, and fired five shots with a revolver at or towards Mr. Thaddeus’s brother, who came in their way, but without hitting him. In Mr. Davis’s case the burglar was a soldier ; and in Mr. Thaddeus’s case also one of the offenders, who has been arrested, is a soldier. Both incidents have been specially brought to the notice of the Wali with a view to securing that energetic action which is required when the military garrison of a city themselves take to burglary. 12. : A shocking tragedy has occurred at Kadhimain in the house of a British Indian subject, his daughter and her husband or paramour (a Turkish subject) having been murdered in it in broad daylight. No eye-witnesses of the deed are^ forthcoming, but ‘ Abdul Ghani, a son of the house, has been arrested, the circums tantial evidence against him being strong, also one or two others whom the Turkish authorities suspect of complicity. A Residency Dragoman has assisted in the police enquiries on the spot, and it was to suggestions by him that the discovery of a knife and revolver, which may be important pieces of evidence, was due. The only conjecturable reasons for the crimes if committed by Abdul Ghani which he himself denies—are that he objected to his sister’s doubtful relations with the murdered man, who had, moreover, been a notorious bad character and who, as a Sunni, could not have been welcome in a Shi’ah household even as a son or brother- in-law. . ... 13. The Wall’s reply about the maltreatmentf of Mr. Cree’s cinematograph , 0 __ „ clerk gave a different version of the facts Sammary ' V&gt; 8 ' from that which I received; and, as the matter is not important and Mr. Cree has not pressed it, I have thought better to let it drop. According to the Wali Mr. Cree’s employe was informed of the order for closing places of amusement on the night in question and was not beaten when he defied it, but only admonished. 14. I lately received fresh summonses from the Turkish authorities for Captain McPherson, I.M.S., late Residency Surgeon, and for Drs. Johnson and Stanley of j Sec Summary for February and March, 1911 , the Church Mission Society, in connection VITI &gt; 8 - with the so-called illegal J practice by them of medicine at Baghdad. Captain McPherson and Dr. Johnson have gone C142FDhome, the former 13 months since, and Dr. Stanley has been transferred* to Musal; * See paragraph 5 on pages 14-15. moreover, Dr. Johnson and Doctor Stanley both possess the Constantinople qualifica tion and the local Turkish authorities were informed of this more than a year ago. There was also a summons for a fourth unknown individual whose name appeared Greek, and who is certainly not a British subject at Baghdad. In all the 'circums tances of the case, I have thought it permissible, for once, to adopt Turkish official tactics and ignore the communication altogether. 15; Captain Hore-Ruthvenf, finding it impossible to travel to Kirmanshah in the present state of Persia, returned to ^ See last Summary, v, 5. Baghdad on the 3rd April and took the Aleppo route for Europe. He drove the 500 miles from Baghdad to Aleppo in 12J days with one team ot horses, which nevertheless reached the end of the journey in perfect condition. Mr. Landon, though he waited a few days longer at the Persian frontier, was also obliged in the end to make his way back to Baghdad and so to Aleppo. 16. On the 20th of April I received a visit from Muhammad ’Ali Khan, B.A., a pleader of Meerut (India), who had spent about'a year in Palestine, the Hijaz, and other parts of Turkey. He was connected by marriages, he said, with the Amir of Afghanistan, and the ladies of his family were returning to India by sea, while he, out of curiosity, was making the homeward journey overland by Beirut, Baghdad and Bashrah. He had left Beirut on the day immediately preceding the attack by the Italians on two Turkish vessels there. I did not ask Muhammad ’Ali for his view about the state of Turkey, but he volunteered the opinion that it was worse than it had been when he visited the country some years ago under the old regime. He remarked that he respected the sincere followers of all religions, but that the present rulers of Turkey i seemed to him to have no religion at all. It is probable that the Muhammadans of India are coming to realise, through travellers of the type of Muhammad ’Ali Khan, that the Khalifate, as exercised by the Sultan of Turkey in present circumstances, is not likely to be a credit to Islam. VI. —British official matters. l.\ The following are the stages of an official tour which I lately made in con nection, chiefly, with Oudh Bequest affairs :— Baghdad to Babylon Babylon Babylon to Mahannawiyah Makannawiyah to Hindiyah Barrage Hindiyah Barrage Hindiyah Barrage to Karbala Karbala Karbala to Tawairij Tawairij to Kufah Kufa (Najaf) ..

The reorganisation^; of the Oudh Bequest arrangements lately sanction ed by the Government of India was t Sec Summary for January 1912, VI, 6. carried out in the c0 ^ rse of ^ ^ At Karbala the money was allotted among seven Mujtahids, who were already distributors, but the amounts of their respective portions were increased, twovacancies which had occurred being left unfilled. A share of Rs. 800 per mensem was reserved for a former distributor, who happened to be absent at Kadhimain and from whom it was consequently not possible to enquire whether he accepted the new conditions of appointment. Two of the distributors at Karbala were ndians, and so were three of the seven members nominated by the Resident to ^ ° n .* e ( . ommittee formed under the orders of the Government of India for the distribution of the available funds, viz., a moiety of the whole. The rest of the distributors and nominated members of the Committee were Persians; only one ot tnem, a committee member, was a Turkish subject. The greater part of the money disbursed went in charity, and the'circumstances of each applicant for relief were most carefully weighed, and, if necessary, investi- gatcd out of doors, by the Committee, before any thing was given him or her. Most of the recipients were sufferers from disabilities as age, blindness, ill-health or w-ere persons otherwise unable to maintain themselves as orphan children, widows etc. Grants to individuals capable of earning a livelihood were restricted to a limited number of theological students without means. Such cannot work for their living and study theology, and the Committee considered them to be deserving persons. ® The table below gives a detail of the poor relieved at Karbala on the present occasion from two months’ yield of the fund (January and February 1912) Indian men Their dependents Indian women Their dependents Persian men „ Their dependents Persian women . Their dependents 110 173 146 53 196 440 154 135 \ Total .. 1,407 Out of a sum of about £. T.-367 available for distribution, approximately £. T.-313 was distributed to the above persons. The remainder went mostly in the honoraria of the nominated members of the Committee, which were fixed at the moderate See V, 7 on page 16. uniform rate of £. T.-2 per mensem ; in a grant to the Indian* Free School atfKarbala ; in exchange ; in wages to a banker, a clerk and a messenger ; and a small sum was reserved for incidental charities until the next distribution. At Najaf, where there were already three vacancies, three former distributors were confirmed; two former distributors, who refused to attend, probably as not accepting the new conditions, were treated as dismissed ; and one new distributor (an Indian) was appointed. Two former distributors were absent at Kadhimain and their attitude to the new conditions was not known ; the shares intended to be conferred on them, amounting to Rs. 1,700 a month, were accordingly reserved. A further sum of Rs. 1,000 per mensem was reserved with a view to the possible appointment of two new Indian Mujtahids, about whose qualifications enquiry has been made from the Government of India. The nominated members of Committee appointed were seven, to equal the ultimate number of the distributors; three of of them were Indians, two were Arabs, one was an Afghan, and one a Turk. The principles of distribution were the same as at Karbala, but'at'Najaf the proportion of theological students assisted was greater, in accordance with the differ ent character of the place ; and the number of Indian recipients of charity was fewer, the Indian colony here being small.20 The following were the Indian men classes relieved at Najaf :— • • •• • • •• • 40 Their dependents .. 27 Persian men .. .. 305 Their dependents • • • • • •• • • .. 618 Persian women .. • • • • • • • • .. 164 Their dependents • • • • •• .. 151 Total souls ..1,305 The amount of money actually distributed to the poor was nearly the same as at Karbala, and the other expenses were very similar. Both at Karbala and Najaf the term “Persian” in the tables should be under stood to include a few Arabs and others. I had some doubt, before these distributions took place, as to the advisability of any large part of the Oudh Bequest being devoted to poor relief, pure and simple. But after sitting and working with the two committees for nearly three weeks, I think that even in this way the Bequest may serve an excellent purpose and one in exact accordance with the intentions of the King of Oudh. There are no poor law arrangements in this country, and in the towns of Kerbala and Najaf the number . of helpless people and children, most of them foreigners or of foreign extrac tion, who do not know where to turn for an ounce of bread, is lamentable. But close attention will always be required to prevent the growth of a system of promis cuous and demoralising doles. It is to be hofped that in future the Committee may find a means of setting some money aside for medical arrangements. This may become possible as present dis tributors with vested rights die and are succeeded by others who are willing to throw more than half of their allowances into the Committee funds. Blindness among adults and eye disease among children are, I should say, more common than in India or even Egypt; and I noted two cases of leprosy. The new system was received with high approbation by all whose own inter ests it did not affect unfavourably. The distributors and other members of the Committees all seemed to feel that they were engaged in a good work ; some of them rose to unexpected heights of earnestness and even enthusiasm ; and public opinion was reflected in the dream of a poor carpet-weaver of Karbala, in which I she saw the Vice-Consul (Mr. Muhammad Hasan) anointed on the head by a veiled lady who proved to be the daughter of ’Ali himself. Among the recipients for relief at Karbala were the deserted wife and daugh ter of a former distributor. This Mujtahid, when first appointed, had only one wife ; but he afterwards married two or three others in additjbn, began to keep a horse, etc., and gave nothing to the poor. After his dismissal, which occurred before my time, he disappeared from Karbala. This is an instance of how the money ran to waste under the old system. His wife and daughter at Karbala were only too thankful to receive 10 shillings between them from the Oudh Bequest Committee. But it was not to be expected that the change of system should be ac complished without some, opposition, or that distributors, who had been bat tening upon the Bequest for years at the expense of the poor whom they were expected to relieve, should submit tamely to the loss of even half their emolu ments. The malcontents and their sympathisers are mostly Persian subjects, but they have a convenient weapon at hand in the political suspicions of the Turks. I foresaw* that attempts would be made * last Summary, VI, 6. misrepresent the distributions as con cealing some sinister design ; and I therefore visited the Wali on the day before my departure from Baghdad, and explained to him in some detail the nature of the case. I was careful to visit the Mutasarrif at Karbala and the Qaim-Maqam at Najaf on my arrival at those places, and to keep them au courant of what was being done ; in fact I invited each of them to come and witness the distri bution if it interested him.21 A somewhat disagreeable article on the Oudh Bequest new arrangements appeared in the Baghdad newspaper “ Riyadh ” of the 25th March, in which it was suggested that their motive was purely political; but a later number stated that the action of the British C onsul-General in the matter had been quite correct, and that the 1 urkish authorities had taken measures to prevent political intrigues (apparently on the part of the British Consul-General). I am inclined to at tribute this partial dcwienti to the influence of the W ah, for there is nothing that the new rulers of Turkey fear so much as to be accused in the press of insufficient distrustfulness towards foreigners. Hostile notices also appeared in the “Zuhur” of Baghdad; and these have not, so far as I am aware, been withdrawn. There seems to be no doubt that since my return to Baghdad pressure has been put on all the non-British subjects, who joined the Oudh Bequest Committee at Karbala, to sever their connection with it, on pain of expulsion from Karbala. One of them, a Turkish subject, has now written to the “ Zuhur ” announcing his withdrawal from the Committee, of which he has not yet informed the &amp; Vice- Consul or myself; and the Persian subjects on the Committee are known to be in a state of great nervousness. The Turkish subject in question (Saiyid Hasan, Hakimzadah, the host of Lord Curzon when, as Mr. Curzon, he visited Karbala), was a most useful and active member of the Committee, and at the end of the pro ceedings he distributed the whole of his honorarimn as a Committee member in alms to the poor; it may be judged that he did not resign voluntarily. The Persian members of the Committee seem to have been intimidated by the Persian Consul at Karbala under instructions from the Persian Consulate-General at Baghdad, which in turn had succumbed to pressure from the Wali of Baghdad; but the Turkish Muta- sarrif of Karbala seems also to have held direct communication with them on the subject, no doubt under the orders of the Wali. It would be a mistake to attach too much importance to the present machina tions of the Turks. Mr. Muhammad Hasan informs me that the last time a change was made in the management of the Oudh Bequest, there were similar intrigues by them and by Persians which resulted in nothing. It is by no means certain that the Persians will allow themselves to be deterred by the Turks from helping in the work of the Bequest, and, if they do, British Indians can be found on the spot or brought from India to take their places both as Mujtahid distributors and as members of committee. But it would be a pity, from some points of view, if the arrangements were to lose their present universal Shi'ah character, embracing Indians, Persians and Arabs alike, and were to assume an exclusively Indian com plexion. 3. Lambardars or headmen have now been appointed* by me in most of the * Summary for January 1912 , vr, s. Butish Indian colonies in Mesopotamia, There are six headmen at Baghdad itself, four at Kadhimain, six at Karbala, and one at Najaf. A single Lambardarwill probably be appointed at each of the following places also: Musaiyib, Tawairij, Samarra. Already the Lambardars are proving useful as a means of communica tion between the Indian community and the Residency, and numerous cases in which registration has been neglected by British Indian subjects have been brought to notice by their agency. 4. The question of providing hostels for Indian Shi’ah pilgrims at the Holy Places is being kept in view. A petition from India that arrangements should be made, and the liberal offer of an Indian nobleman in the same connection, were f See Summary for January 1912 , VI, 7. mentioned in a former report.] At Karbala it will probably be possible to obtain a lease of a large, well-built and centrally situated grain-store owned by Raja Saiyid Abu Ja 'far of Faizabad (United Provinces, India) on favourable terms and to convert it at a‘ moderate cost into an excellent hostel capable of accommodating 200 Indian pilgrims, which is about the maximum number ever present in Karbala at one time. Sartaj Jang, Haidarabadi, who offered an annual donation for Indian hostels, will be consulted in regard to this scheme which promises to meet his views admirably. At Najnf it is proposed to hire a good but not very large house, also belonging to Raja Sai yid Abu Ja ’far, as an office for distributions under the Oudh Bequest; and this C142FDbuilding would serve, except when actally in use for distribution work, as a hostel for the accommodation of pilgrims. If possible no room hire will be charged in the hostels to poor pilgrims; and, in each, a shop will be provided on the premises at which all can supply their wants conveniently and at a reasonable rate. The Pilgrim agents continue to discharge their duties to the general satisfac tion ; but at Samarra the Turkish Qaim-Maqam has objected to/distinctive badge bearing the words “ British Pilgrim Agent,” which was supplied to the Agent there, as to the Agents at other places, to enable the pilgrims to recognise them. It seems that the numbers of Indian pilgrims assisted by the staff since the institution of the present arrangements have been:— In 1910, from 3rd February J o 31st December .. .. .. 1,095 In 1911, during the whole year .. .. •• •• •• 1,114 Ir 1912, from 1st January to 18th April .. .. .. .. 613 These figures do not include the numerous pilgrims of the Borah community, which has pilgrim arrangements of its own. 5. The Porte having complained to His Britannic Majesty’s Government with reference to the circumstances* attending the last relief of the Baghdad Residency * „ 0 . T imo X7T . Guard, that a depot of arms and ammu- * Summary for January 191A VI, 4. • &gt; i • • i mtion was being lormed in the Residency, I have reported in detail on the case under orders from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. The allegation that the relieved guard eft their rifles behind them at Baghdad is of course untrue, and the Wali cannot be acquit ted of culpable carelessness in reporting it to his Government. On the 6th March, at a private interview with the Wali at his house, I told him a good deal about the history of the Residency Guard and the usages connect ed with it which appeared to be new to him, He practically confessed to me that what he wanted was a procedure at the relief of guards which would not expose him to newspaper attacks, and in my despatch to the Embassy 1 have sug gested a permissive variation in the arrangements for the future. I pointed out to the Wali that, though there was no rule against it and though the daily appear ance of our men under arms in the public street had only ceased since the occupa tion of the new Residency, we did not allow them to visit the town in uniform even when off duty. I added that I thought he would admit that they were very well ; conducted. The Wali replied that they were “tres braves gens” and that he re marked with pleasure that they never failed to salute Turkish officers in the street, though themselves wealing mufti. In my opinion the question of the presence of a British military guard and a British stationnaire at Baghdad cannot safely be raised until Baghdad has been connected with the Persian Gulf by a railway on terms which will ensure prompt relief of this isolated station in case of danger. It may be possible, when the ! time comes, to arrange for special railway facilities for the Resident to compen- I sate for the loss of the ‘ ‘ Comet ’ ’. 6. At a private visit, which the \\ ali paid to me on the 19th April, I asked him about two cases of disputed nationality— t Ss* Summary for July ion, v, 6. thosef of ’Abbas and Saiyid Muhammad 'Ali—in regard to which I had written to him officially some time before and had received no answer. These cases are under discussion at Constantinople between His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy and the Porte. The Wali replied that he had reported to his Government at length regarding the principles on which such cases should be decided, bot that he had not yet given an opinion as to the nationality of the two individuals in question. He accepted without difficulty a proposal by me that this point should be discussed between myself and the Assist ant Wali or the Director of Political Affairs. This is a step in advance, as a year ago the Wilayat could not be induced to discuss the claims of the two individuals with this Residency. I gathered that the view of the Porte was that persons claiming British nationality should ^invariably be required to produce other documents, such as passports in evidence, besides their certificates of registration. I did not fail to point out that in the case of Indians long settled in this country and theirdescendants, the existence of additional papers was not to be expected, and that it would be only natural, in the absence of such papers, to have recourse to the statements of witnesses or to enquiries from the authorities in India regarding alleged facts of family history. 7, No information has been received here of any rescindment of the order J under which British officers are precluded from visiting Mesopotamia without the special permission of His Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Nevertheless British officers continue to arrive here on leave, and I generally know nothing of their presence in the country until they have left Basrah for Baghdad. If it is desired to prevent unauthorised visits, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah might be empowered to require officers not furnished with regular permission to return from that place. During April, Major A. Hewlett of the Central India Horse (from Bushehr) and Mr. H. G. Gauntlett of the York and Lancaster Regiment (from India) were in this country. Neither was aware of having transgressed any regulation. The former only visited Babylon, but the latter made a tour to Musal. Major Hore- * „ TT , , Ruthven’s* jo rney in this province ex- ee , oa)ove. tended into April; he also knew of po prohibition. Personally I do not think that short visits by British officers to recognised places of interests—such as Baghdad, Babylon, the Hindiyah Barrage and Karbala—are now likely to do harm ; but long tours by them off the beaten track certainly cause suspicion and comment. 8. Mr. Townsend, R.E. of the. Public Works Department, whose headquarters are at Bushehr, was at Baghdad from the 18th to the i8th April to inspect the Residency buildings, which had not been professionally examined for some time. I understand that, notwithstanding some cracks due to unequal subsidence of the foundations, he considers them to be in a satisfactory state ; but a large amount of new pointing is required, to a certain height above ground level, in order to arrest disintegration of the mortar, due to damp, which has set in. 9: Mr. E. B. Soane, Agent of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Chah-i- Surkh and British Vice-Consul for Qasr-i-Shirin, spent some days at Baghdad during April. Mr. Soane, who has lived much in Kurdistan in various capacities and has an unrivalled knowledge of the Kurdish language, brought with him much interesting news of the progress of events in his consular district, which borders on that now occupied by the Salar-ud-Dowlah. Important information, which he supplied in regard to threatened t See III, n, pages io i3. * Turkish encroachments on Persia, has been mentioned already! ; and I hope to be able, with his assistance , to give His Britannic Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople more prompt and reliable news in future of Turkish movements on the frontier between MandaN and Sulaimaniyah. 10. From several weeks’ observation in the British! Post office at Baghdad . o , . 0 . it would seem that the American Consul J last Summary, VI, 5. i i n i i • . at Baghdad sends and receives through it the whole of his official correspondence with both Washington and Constantinople. It appears to be the medium of communication in both directions between the German Consulate and the German Foreign Office at Berlin, but not between the Consulate and the German Embassy at Constantinople. The German Consul, who is at present in charge of Italian interests here, also sends letters to Rome through the British Office, and it has been used by the French Consul in writing to Morocco. Correspondence both ways between the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and the Austro-Hungarian Consulate passes through it. The Russian Consul- General lately received several covers from St. Petersburg by British post, but who the sender was did not appear. As from Beirut onwards some of the Powers represented at Baghdad have posts of their own to Europe, which it is no doubt a point of honour with them to support, their making use to the extent that they do of the British Post Office is a valuable testimony in its favour. In the above remarks no account has been )J taken of the correspondence, whether official or private, of foreign C onsuls at Baghdad with the Persian Gulf, India, etc. VII.— Foreign Interests and Cases (except Persian and British). 1. While on tour at Najaf I met for the first timeAbul Qasim*, the Russian 0 ^ , rTT _ Consular Agent at that place. He is a Shirwani, intelligent, young, and a Russian subject. He said nothing to me about being dissatisfied with his position, and I gathered that he was now receiving pay, but his small house showed evident signs of poverty. He entertained me with extraordinary tales of the oppressions . o . . c in K of the late Qaim-Maqamt of Najaf, Aziz Bev, t See last Summary, III, 5. ^ r'.i J + especially at the time of the war agitation J + See Summary for January, in, 2. i n Rajaf, when the Qaim-Maqam twice wrote to Abul Qasim officially desiring him not to leave his house. The pretext was popular excitement, but the real reason was that Abul Qasim used to go where the Qaim-Maqam went and listen to his inflammatory speeches. 2. At Najaf I was told about 30 Circassians from Russia had visited the town in February, and had given out that they were only the precursors of a much larger number of their tribe who had determined, like themselves, to emigrate from Russia to Turkey on account of the discomfort of their position as Muhammadans in the former country. They came to Najaf on pilgrimage only, and it was understood that their destination was ’Amarah on the Tigris, where the Turkish Government had promised to assign them lands. The leader of the party was said to be the son of a General in the Russian service who was killed in the Russo-Japanese war. 3. The Patriarch of the Chaldaean Catholics has been made a ^ommander of the French Legion d’Honneur. This would seem to show that the French Government have not yet relinquished their traditional policy of utilising the Chaldaejp Catholics in the Musal Wilayat as a medium of French political influ ence. It is difficult to understand the object of such a policy which must often be embarrassing to the French themselves, for they have no practical interests to benefit by it. Also the time is not far off when railway communication with the outside world will introduce commercialism into Musal and relegate ecclesiasti cal power to quiet corners. The Chaldaean Catholic Patriarch is expected, I understand, to divide his time between Musal and Baghdad; but for the last two years his head-quarters have remained continuously at Musal. No doubt the interests of his church in that direction are more important and less secure than at Baghdad. His sub stitute here, the Reverend Stephen Jibri, Bishop of Nisibin, seems to be growing tired of his long exile at Baghdad, which he understood in the beginning to be only a temporary transfer. The Chaldean Catholics claim to be the largest of the Christian communities at Baghdad, and no doubt they are. Their Bishop assures me that they number 1,000 houses, but this estimate seems to be excessive. 4. I was at Babylon from the 7th to the 9th March as the guest of the German archaeologists there. Much progress has been made with the excavations since my last visit two years ago. The great Processional Way has now been traced from the north-east corner of the Fort Palace, through the gate of Ishtar, to an exit from the town between the Temple and of Marduk§, the God of War, and the* Tower of Babel ; here it reached §The “ Merodacb ” of Scripture. ? bridge across the o]d of the Eu _ phrates, of which the piers have been discovered and are the oldest known remains of a bridge in the world. A great deal has been done in tracing the streets of the ancient town, and many of its private dwellings have been explored. The last by their small and mean appearance destroy many romantic prepossessions. A black and white temple of Ishtar, surrounded by private houses, has been care- fu^disinterred, but evidently its architectural pretensions were never consi derable. Altogether some 10 kilometres of underground galleries have been dug by the German Engineers, and some shafts sunk by them in the mound of ’Amran-bin-Ali at the temple of Marduk reach a depth of 24 metres and are perhaps the deepest archseological borings yet made, except at Troy.25 The only feature of artistic interest at Babylon is the gate of Ishtar with its large expanses of wall and its base reliefs in brick of the dragon of Marduk and the bull of Rumman, the God of Thunder. The Turkish authorities refuse to let duplicates of these bas-reliefs, which repeat themselves, be removed to Germany,— a refusal which is absurd as it is unjust. At Babylon they can be seen by hut a few, and they are exposed to mutilation by fanatical Arabs who consider them to be idols. A Turkish Commissioner is attached to the German Archeeolotdcal Mission, virtually as a spy upon their actions. 5. In the course of the past winter, with the consent of the Turkish Govern ment, excavations were begun at Ohaimir, an ancient site about 9 miles south east of Babylon, by a French Mission organised by the French Ministry of Public Instruction. The German Mission, who considered that Ohaimir fell within the scope of their concession for the excavation of Babylon, at first contested the French rights; but they have had to give w^ay. The personnel of the French Mission are a M. de Genouillac, who is an Abbe but enjoys a dispensation from wearing clerical costume, and an enginner named M. Drouin. Both have now T left for France to return when the summer is over and instal themselves en 'permanence ; this year they had only tents to live in. From photographs, which they have taken, it would seem that they have struck a very promising site with objects likely to surpass, at least in spectacular interest, those of Babylon. Their methods, too, seem to have more energy and intuition than those of the Germans, whose mental activity cannot but have suffered by 13 years' systematic drudgery at one task. The French Mission, notwithstanding the political insignificance of France in Mesopotamia, have not been exempt from those rubs which all w r ho have work to do in Turkey must expect. A small tricolor, which they had hoisted at their camp, remained unobjected to for about tw r o months; and it was then suddenly reported to the Turkish authorities as a proof that the Mission entertained terri torial designs, and their arrangements for obtaining native labour were misre presented as intrigues with Arab chiefs in the French interest. The matter seems to have gone as far as Constantinople, and to have been the subject of an interview between the Wali and the French Consul at Baghdad. (It is much to be regretted that the British, who w^ere the pioneers of archao- j logy in these regions, are now unrepresented in the Mesopotamian field. If the matter could be represented through the India Office to the British Museum, or in some other suitable quarter, a learned society or private munificence might perhaps step into the breach. It is important that, at the present critical epoch which will determine future political influence, no means of establishing British interests should be neglected. I apprehend that the Parthian and Greek sites of Ctesiphon and Seleucia, which adjoin one another and are. within a day's journey of Baghdad, would afford fresh and interesting material: they have never, I think, been Investigated. The main building of Ctesiphon seems on the point * See Tour Journal No. i of 1910 under of collapse, * and its features should be date nth February 1910. recorded in detfilgjl before it finally dis appears. A preliminary concession for research at Ctesiphon was said, before the Italo-Turkish war, to have been granted to the Italian f Consul at Baghdad ; t See Summary for September 1911, vn, 6. but '0 advantage was taken of it, and it. j may now be held to have lapsed). 1 6. About the middle of April a rumour spread in Baghdad that the Baghdad Railway Company’s^ proposed trace for the line from Aleppo to Baghdad had been accepted by the Turkish Govern- x See last Summary, \ II, i. ment. I mentioned the report to Meissner Pasha, who replied that the rumour went beyond the truth; there were “ indications ” only, but they were favourable^ Immediately after this Meissner Pasha and Dr. Endrucks left for Basrah by steamer to make arrangements, it was understood, for the transport of railway material to Baghdad. (Meissner Pasha returned to Baghdad on the 2nd May, but I have not again seen him to speak to.) 7. There is talk of recommendations made by the German Consul for acquir ing a Consulate in keeping with the dignity of the German Government at Baghdad—the Consul at present hires a house for himself/and it appears to emanatefrom the German Consulate itself. In my opinion Germany is likely to delay decisive steps until her position in Mesopotamia is a little better defined and con solidated ; and then, probably, we may look for a Consulate-Generaljon the largest and most sumptuous scale. The German Embassy building at Constantinople is an example of the lengths to which Teutonic megalomania, combined in that particular instance with want of taste can run. If I may venture to say so, I think that the British Residency here should be maintained intact in all its appurtenances, such as military guard, stationnaire, etc., until we know on what scale the final arrangements of the German Govern ment in this country will be. In particular, the Turkish design of driving a street through the Residency grounds should be resisted; I have reason to fear that this purely malicious scheme is only dormant, and that it is a fixed item in the programme for Baghdad of the Union and Progress party. The disadvantage at which we should be placed is obvious, supposing the present expensive Ilesidency to wnich we are tied to have been spoiled and the Germans at liberty to create* a larger and better Consulate-General in a position where it cannot be interfered with. tT’' 8. The fiat has gone forth for the expulsion of Italian subjects from Baghdad. It was supposed at first to have been promulgated by the \Y ali on his own autho rity after the bombardment of Sidd-al-Bahr and Qum-Qalasi; but, however^ this may have been, the order was in the end confirmed by the Porte. The Ger man Consul did his best but inofEectually, for the few unfortunate individuals at Baghdad whom the decree effected. Actually it only applied to one merchant (M. Enriquez, a Jew, one employe of the Tobacco Regie (M. de Kirico), one teach er in the Jewish school, and their families. M. de Kirico has applied for and obtained Turkish nationality and so saved himself from expulsion. The others have been expelled. M. Enriquez, who dealt almost exclusively in Austrian and German goods, will suffer very seriously in his business. It is understood that even now the order for the expulsion of Italians is not of universal application in Turkey, and at Baghdad no useful purpose has been served by applying it; but the present Wali is a chauvinist of the most pronounced type and seems to have/determined to do what in him lay to wreak vengeance on Italy in his own Wilayat. VIII.— Commercial Matters. ' 1. The locomotive* supplied by Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co. for~the Kufah- * See Summary for December 1910 , xi, s. Najaf tramway has unfortunately not been a success. I undestand that, as the result of private arbitration, the firm from whom it was obtained are now being obliged to take it back. Abdur-Rahman (Pachachizadah), the principal shareholder in the Tramway Company, informs me, however, that he is getting two new lo 3 omotives to replace it through Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co. The Company, though their trams are perforce still drawn by horses, seem to be in a very flourishing position. Their £ T. 2 shares ate said to be selling for £ T. 6. 2. It is stated that Mahmud Shahbandar, after spending two years at Cons- ^ See Summary for September 1911 , vin, 5 . tantinople and in Europe, has/icceeded in obtaining confirmation^ of his concession for an electric tramway from Mu’adhdham to Qararah, via Baghdad, and for the light ing of Baghdad by electricity. 3. Ya’qub Tsai Pasha, an Oriental Christian of Baghdad, stated at the begin ning of April to a reliable person here that he had obtained permission from the Turkish Government to navigate the Tigris with three steamers and six barges under the style of “The National Ottoman Syndicate”. He added that the capital of the concern would all be British, and that Messrs. Paulings, apparently an import ant firm of railway contractors, are interested. I am told that the Pasha wished to make a beginning by hiring a steamer from Messrs. Lynch, but that the Wali told him he must not hire from that firm under any circumstances. Ya’qub Tsai, whose correspondent in London appears to be a Mr. Faust Lurion of Fenchurch St., is described as an untruthful person; but Messrs. Paulings are being mentioned at Baghdad as possible competitors for the Mesopotamian irrigaton works contract, which, it is said, they would only be likely to undertake with the object of getting into some railway enterprise later.The principal of the above facts were brought to the knowledge of His Brit annic Majesty s Embassy at Constantinople at the time by telegram. 4. The congestion* in the Baghdad Customs House continues appalling. The * Ses last Summary, viii, 2 . Nazir or Bash-Mudir told me on the 10th , i. . . April that there were then 23,000 bales of merchandise for Persia, worth £. T. 250,000, depositd in the charge of the Cus toms at Baghdad. It has been necessary, for want of space, to revert to the old and now illegal system of allowing goods to be deposited in private warehouses under the joint keys of the owner and the Customs House. Mr. Cree of Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Co., tells me that the uncleared goods of his firm are now kept on the firm’s own premises under double locks. If the Central Customs administration at Constantinople understand the state of matters at Baghdad, they can hardly hesitate to sanction an increase in the staff here. This seems to be the only palliative at present possible, and, in view of the productiveness of the Baghdad Customs House, some liberality of treatment would seem justifiable. 5. The Eastern Bankf Limited, lately sent representatives to Baghdad 1 Summary for January, vm, 7 . persons of Mr. E. J. Portham and Mr. H. Manwaring, who arrived here in March. It appears that this new Bank is closely connected with the British firm of Messrs. E. D. Sassoon and Co., and that they have come to an arrangement with the National Bank of Turkey, whereby they will represent the National, Bank at Baghdad and the National Bank will represent them at Constantinople. The Eastern Bank have made an unfortunate start at Baghdad. Adverse reports concerning their manager seem to have been telegraphed to their London office, perhaps with reference to the sobriety of his habits. The management re quested my opinion by telegraph ; but before they could have received my reply, which was sent through the Foreign Office, they transferred Mr. Portham to Bom bay and placed Mr. Manwaring, a quite young man, in temporary charge at Bagh dad. Mr. Manwaring is now reversing the policy of his predecessor in trying to sub-let premises already engaged by Mr. Portham and in hiring others less commo dious but more centrally situated. My reply to the Bank’s query was that the in sinuations against Mr. Portham did not seem to be fully substantiated and that there were possibly intrigues against him. I am inclined to think that there was friction between him and a Mr. Y. A. Yari, whom Messrs. E. D. Sassoon and Co. have lately sent here to open a branch of their own business and to act, apparently, as an expert adviser to the Eastern Bank. In any case these initial accidents have weakened the Bank for encountering the opposition which it is likely to meet with from the Imperial Ottoman Bank, the Turkish authorities, and various Jewish firms and merchants. 6. Messrs Strick and Co., who have long been established at Basrah, have now sent a Mr. Harvey to Baghdad to open a branch of their business there. They appear to be considering the possibility of starting a large general shop at Baghdad on the lines of the Army and Navy Stores, Bombay. 7. The affairs of Messrs. Mashal Brothers, Ltd., a company registered at Man chester but including among its shareholders persons who are Turkish subjects in Turkey, whose local manager here (Mr. J. H. Mashal) is a Turkish subject at Bagh dad, have been giving some trouble. The firm began operations at Baghdad in the summer of 1911, with the idea of running motor cars between Baghdad and Khanaqin and Baghdad and Karbala, and of setting up a mechanical workshop. But though they have imported two ca^s they have not yet been able to run them, and they have not succeeded in obtaining permission to open the workshop. My instructions in regard to the Company were at first of a restricted charac ter, only authorising me to act as a medium of communication between them and the local authorities; and Mr. Mashal seems at first to have tried to arrange the firm’s difficulties himself, putting his personal status as an Ottoman subject in the foreground. Later, when it became apparent that the concern which he represent ed was a British Company, the Turks grew suspicious, and his principals at home had recourse to the Foreign Office, London. His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassadorat Constantinople then called on me for information in regard to the grievances of the firm at Baghdad, which I supplied; and, after the international status of the firm had been further investigated, I was directed to afford it all proper ass^-tice at Baghdad. Meanwhile, on the 22nd March, a petition from Messrs. Mashal to the Wali for permission to install engineering plant had been forwarded through this Consulate- General, as medium of communication, to the Wilayat. On the 19th of April the Wali, being questioned, informed me that all the papers of the case had been sent to Constantinople for orders. Mr. J. H. Mashal had reason to believe, however, that the papers were still at Baghdad a week after this assurance. The work of the firm is at a standstill, which no doubt causes them serious loss, for besides Mr. J. H. Mashal they have an English engineer on their Baghdad staff. They evidently adhere to their motor car scheme, for Mr. Mashal is now engaging a British Indian chauffeur. The difficulties, which they have met with, would prob ably have been mor? quickly overcome if Mr. J. H. Mashal’s dealings with the Turks had not been somewhat ambiguous. 8. The final contract with the (British) National Bank of Turkey for a loan* of , 7TTT . £. T. 30,000 was signed by the Wali and * See Summary for January, the p r e S ident of the Baghdad Munici pality on the 24th April. The capital sum of £. T. 30,000 includes, I understand, Summary (or October . 910 , in, 3. the advancef of f T 10,000 already re- ceived by the Municipality from the Bank. 9. Mr. Holmes, formerly of Messrs. Asquith and Lord’s, Bombay, has opened a tailor’s shop at Baghdad under the name of Messrs. Holmes and Bahoshi. Mr. a P B Holmes is one of the English* tailors who tSee Summary for .Sovember 191C, lx, s. v i s it e d Baghdad in 1910; and he came again, on behalf of the firm which he then represented, in 1911. His partner, Dr. Bahoshi, is a native practitioner of medicine at Baghdad and physician to the Russian Consulate-General. It is understood that each has put £. 500 into the business. IX.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. It is stated that the Shaikh of Kuwait has written to Saiyid Mahmud Shukri Effendi (Alusizadah), an Arab notable of Baghdad, offering him the di rectorship of a school or college which the Shaikh is said to have established lately at Kuwait. It is believed that the Saiyid is inclined to accept the offer. 9 One Maulvi ’Abdul Qadir lately arrived from India with ghilafs, or valuable coverings, from the Haidarabad State (Deccan, India) for the shrine of Shaikh ’Abdul Kadir (Gilani) at Baghdad and for the shrines of Karbala and Najaf. He algo brought cash presents for the Naqib of Baghdad and the Kiliddars of Karbala and Najaf. Such offerings were usual some years ago, but they were disconti nued some three years since. The Baghdad Customs authorities now claim that customs duty should be paid on the ghilafs, which was not the rule before; and this point, though referred to the Department of Religious Endowments at Constantinople, has not yet been settled Meanwhile, it is being arranged 1 hat the Naqib shall deposit Rs. 500 with the Customs and take delivery of the co^ ering for the Gilani shrine, and a similar arrangement will perhaps be made in regard to the other ghilafs. The Naqib family say that such treatment of pious offerings was unknown under Abdul Hamid, and they are “ roundly abusing the Turks and their Constitution as | enemies to religion. J. G.

If this is collect, the outcome must be regarded as very satisfactory. 3. A brother of the late Sa’dun Pasha §, chief of the Muntafik, recently § See last Summary, I. 2 . sought an interview with His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah.

In the first week of February three loaded lighters were plundered by the Al Bu Muhammad malcontents near Ezm s tomb and two empty ones stripped of their gear. The Turkish authorities at Basrah immediately sent the gunboat “Marmaris” and an armed motor launch to patrol the river between Qurnah and Ezra s tomb and arranged convoys for steameis, and no further damage has been reported. It is said at Baghdad that shots were fired from the bank at the Turkish steamers “ Baghdadi ” and “ Bur- haniyah ” of the Idarah Nahriyah, but without effect. 5 There has been trouble of some sort in the neighbourhood of Diwaniyah probably at Dagharah, and troops have been sent to the spot. Precise inform ation is difficult to obtain, but a mixed column of regulars and tronria • t , Baghdad by land for Diwaniyah on the 6th Febmary ; 8 it appe ar8 fotlT 16 ^ companied by two small guns, probably quick-firers of the mountain pattern 611 T' cording to the best accounts obtainable it consisted of about ISO reXlo. ' , infantry, 200 regular infantry, and 200 mounted gendarmes On the . ary some 300 mounted men arrived from Karbala, probably part of tl ' , ni ' and encamped near tide town. The Commander of the Baehdad A,™ co ' umn » AL Riza Pasha, came there from Baghdad on the same day and left i morning for Najaf in a carriage. He returned to Karbala on the 22n0 “ ilowi ?g 24th he started with the column in the direction of Tawairij. The 2n’d battaBon*of the 109th and 110th Regiments are now at Diwaniyab, also the 5th squadron of the 32nd Regiment; but I am unable to say how or when they arrived there. There is probably some connection between the recent withdrawal* of the 37th Nishanji Battalion from Najaf and the * See last Summary, II. i. occurrence of trouble at Diwaniyah. Najaf is really an important military position from the standpoint of internal admin istration, and it ought not to have been abandoned. It is row garrisoned by the 2nd Battalion of the 111th Regiment, which was perhaps the infantry portion of the column despatched from Baghdad on the 6th February. The greater part of the cavalry portion of that column seems to have returned to Baghdad. The Commandant's journey to Najaf was probably undertaken in order to obtain the information necessary for arranging his plans, which are understood to include a tour through the Euphrates districts down to Samawah and perhaps onwards, through the disturbed “Muntafik ' districts, to Basrah. II. Turkish Affairs. (a) Military. 1. The reorganisationf of the Turkish Army is being carefully watched; one separate report on the subject has already f See Summary for October 1911, II. 1. ^ een gen ^ ^ ^ p r0 p er quarters. Interest centres chiefly in the “ Qadro Bulukler ” or Cadre Units which have been formed, and of which there is now one per regiment. It was understood from the first that these were intended to be skeleton battalions, capable of expansion into full 3rd battalions of all the infantry regiments. Hitherto, however, Cadre Units have been regarded in this province as independent companies and styled “ Buluks ” not “ Taburs ”, besides which they had only one officer apiece. His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah a short time since signalisedj a change in this respect and His Britannic Majesty's % See Summary for December 1911, II. 4. Vice-Consul at Musal has nOW reported under date of 31st January : “ The ‘cadre ' battalions of the 104th, 106th 107th and 108th regiments have been filled, and officers are being sent from Musa ; while care is being taken to send only officers knowing Kurdish, care is also being taken not to send those who are natives of the frontier districts. According to the best information at Baghdad, however, the Cadre Units of the 37th (Baghdad) Division of the 13th (Baghdad) Army Corps are still at Bagh dad on their original footing, and what is now intended is to bring them together into one battalion, which will be a “ Namuneh Taburu ” or Model Battalion. The intention as regards the Cadre Units of the 38th (Basrah) Division is reported to be similar. A statement§ of the distribution of the infantry and cavalry of the 13th Army Corps as it was at the end of February § Annexure A below. j s appended to this report. 2. His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at Musal reports that the Commandant of the 12th Army Corps has published a call for volunteers for military service on the frontier; the terms are that they must know Kurdish and some Persian, shall serve for two years, and shall be paid at the same rate as the' Gendarmerie. Mr. Hony remarks: “ These conditions make it evident that the scheme is designed to get hold of some of the frontier Kurds for military service ; in fact it is probably on the analogy of the old Hamadie Cavalry; it is quite likely that lots of Kurds who would refuse to be conscripted by the Turks will not mind volunteering to serve more or less in their own country I have heard from various sources of Rus sian intrigues among the Kurds, and it seems to me that the Turks are doing all they can to get a strong hold over them before the Russians can get at them.” The Vice-Consul adds that 40 men are to be selected from each battalion of the 12th Army Corps for service in the new frontier companies; ic these are to be men of exceptional excellence and knowing Kurdish.” The formation of “Hudud Bulukleri” or Frontier Companies is certainly a fact and it appears that they will be additions to the former military estab lishment in this province. In the 37th (Baghdad) Division they are beingformed by taking ten men from each of the Nizam battalions. It is beheved that they will be constituted in the same manner in the 38th (Basrah) Division. The ultimate number of these companies is still uncertain, but at Baghdad one or two have already been formed. One of them, 100 strong, left for Khanaqin on the 27th February, and a second seems to have been despatched since to Badrah. It is not known here whether anything has yet been done in the same direction at Basrah. It appears to be intended that the companies, when complete, shall provide a continuous chain of detachments from Bayazid in the north to Basrah in the south. 3. Adjutant-Major Rashid Bey is now acting as Chief of the Staff of the 13th (Baghdad) Army Corps, This appears to be the officer so named who was Chief of the Staff of the 12th (Musal) Army Corps until his departure for Baghdad on the 27th January. The appointment is believed to be temporary. 4. On the 15th February a significant incident occurred at Baghdad on the occasion of the unwilling departure of a batch of 45 new military recruits for Kirkuk. The officer in charge, annoyed or alarmed by the heart-rending farewells of a civilian brother of one of the recruits, ordered a sergeant to shoot the brother; and the non-commissioned officer obeyed with fatal results. The officer and sergeant have been placed under arrest and will be tried by court-martial. The affair, which has caused great indignation, is considered to have its origin in the teaching of Nazim Pasha, late Wali and Army Corps Commandant at Baghadad, who always inculcat ed the principle that soldiers must not hesitate to use their arms in the discharge of their duty. A similar incident during •See Summary for November 1910, VI. 12. Nazim p asha ’ s tenure o{ pow will be remembered*. 5. The 37th Nishanji battalion, lately recalled! from Najaf, is now in the tsee last Summary. II. i. Ordugab or fortified camp on the south- east side of Baghdad Town. Its place at Najaf, as already mentioned, has now been taken by the 2nd Battalionbf the 111th Regiment. 6. An old tower at the South Gate of Baghdad Town has been converted into an armoury or arsenal of the 13th Army Corps. I have not heard that any of the pre-existing depots have been done away with. (b) Civin. 7. A clerical error should be corrected in a former! report in which the present Wali of Baghdad figured as “ Jalal Bey ” tsee last Summary, II. 6. Qf Jamal 8. The Wali informs me that it has been arranged to conclude the Baghdad§ Municipal Loan on a £.T. 30,000 basis. I understand that this means borrowing £. T. 30,000 over and above the advance §See last Summary, viii. 4. 0 £ rp^ jq qqq a i rea( jy given by the Nation al Bank. 9. The Wali is now busy with schemes for the improvement of Baghdad Town, and is referring for guidance to town-planning experts in Fiance, no doubt on the advice of Mr. Godard, the French Consulting Architect of the Bagdhad Wilayat. As His Excellency said that he had no good plan of the town, I have lent him one prepared by Commander Felix Jones of the Indian Navy in 1853-54, which is still accurate in all essentials, and he has sent it to Sir John Jackson, Limited, to be traced. 10. His Excellency is anxious to form a police camel corps, and the idea seems a good and practical one. On his applying to me through Major Roux, the French Gendarmerie adviser here, for information about the equipment and organisation of a camel corps in India, I referred to the military authorities at Simla. The latter will perhaps, after consulting the Foreign Department as I have suggested their doing, be able in some degree to meet the Walks wishes. 11. Another scheme ot the Wali is one for preventing floods at Baghdad by embanking the Tigris above the town, and he has asked Sir John Jackson, Ltd.,4 the Hindiyah Barrage contractors, to have a survey made of the river banks for a distance of 130 kilometres upwards. As Mr. Whitley, the firm’s local manager, has not the staff here for this extraneous piece of work, I have at his request wired to the Government of India enquiring whether two Assistant Engineers could be sent him from India, for about two months, on the terms which he offers. It is possible that to contain the river severely above Bagdhad might only be to raise its level here and inundate the town ; but in any case a mere survey can do no harm. 12. I learnt that Sir John Jackson, Ltd. have at present two engineers out on survey, at the request of the Wali, near Shahraban on the road from Baghdad to Khanaqin. I am inclined to connect this with tjie Wali’s* recent tour to the Khalis ♦See last Summary, n. 6. disti ict and with an agricult* iral disaster there last summer, when a dam on the Diyalah river gave way and a severe drought followed. 13. Regarding the Turkish schemef for irrigation from the Great Zab, His fSee last Summary, n. 8.

The whole staff has been dismissed.” 14. The Wali of Baghdad informs me that he has telegraphed the statistics about the Lower Chenab Canal, with which tSee last Summary, v. 7. j supplied! him, to the Turkish Govern ment. I have since had a conversation with him at which I explained how the problem of the allocation of State lands to canal colonists has been solved in India. He seemed much struck by the Indian system, under which the settlers are at first tenants at will under the Government, but are subsequently converted, if they give satisfaction, into tenants with right of occupancy, while ultimately on the same condition they are allowed to purchase the ownership on very favourable terUis. He remarked that the information was very important and that he would wire it the next day to Constantinople, where the Turkish Chabinet were at that moment deliberating on the disposal of State lands in this countly. 15. The levy of a tax on house property in this province seems to be contem plated by the Government, and very rightly so. But there will be intense opposi tion to the innovation, and I hear that a monster petition is being prepared which argues that the exemption of ‘ Iraq from Amlak taxation has been guaranteed by many former Sultans of Turkey in written Iradehs. 16. As before indicated§ the local press has begun to show hostility towards § See Summary for December 1911 ,1.7. Jamal Bey, the present Mali of Baghdad. The “ Risafah ” lately accused him of try ing to sell valuable lands to foreigners,—a charge for which in any evil sense there can be no foundation, as the reference was to negotiations which are beino 1 con ducted, under the authority of the Minister of Finance, with two MuhamnSidans of Java, Dutch subjects. (It is interesting to note, with an eye to the future development of Mesopotamia, that it is being required of the two Javanese that they should become Turkish subjects and that all cultivators brought into the country by them should be Muhammadans and should adopt Turkish nation ality, also that a school and a mosque should be built by them in every village on the proposed estate.) On the 15th February an article appeared in the “ Mudhi- kat ”, an Arabic comic paper published here, connecting the name of the Wali in a scandalous manner, not perhaps without some superficial justification, with that of a European or Levantine lady at Baghdad. Both papers were immediately suppressed, and judicial proceedings against the editor of the “ Risafah ” have already resulted in his being sentenced to four months’ imprisonment. He con-5 tinues, however, to attack the Wall in the “ Saiqah, ” a new paper which he has started in place of the “ Eisafah. ” The Wali lately spoke to me feelingly of the license of the local press and said that a new press law was much needed in Turkey. He admitted that he had acted ultra vires in suppressing the “ Eisafah ” by administrative order, but he said he hoped that he would be supported by his Government in the matter. 17. Wasaf Bey, Procureur-General of the Baghdad Appeal Court, has been appointed President of the Civil Court at Aleppo and will be relieved here by the Aleppo judge whom he is going to replace. Here Wasaf Bey has shown himself reasonable and fair in his handling of questions affecting British subjects, e.g., that of nationality certificates, and that even when the tendency at Baghdad was all the other way. I hope that his relations with His Britannic Majesty's Consulate at Aleppo will be as conciliatory as those that he has maintained with this Eesi- dency. He is not a man of plausible appearance or address, but in action he is satisfactory. 18. Muhammad Tahir Bey, the Mutasarrif of Karbala, has been removed from his post without warning ; a temporary substitute arrived on the evening of the 18th February in the person of the head of the Education Department at Baghdad. The ez-Mutasarrif was an inefficient and undignified nonentity, but beyond this the British Vice-Consul at Karbala had no complaint to make of him. It is thought that his permanent successor will be Ibrahim Fahim, now Mutasarrif of Hauran. This individual once officiated as Mutasarrif at Karbala, where he showed himself “ too light in his manners and too rash and reckless in his official transactions ^; but age and experience may now have brought him wisdom. 19. With effect from the 8th February the period of quarantine at Basrah against healthy vessels from India has been reduced from 10 days to 5 days, reckon ed from the time of departure from the last Indian port. This means that travel lers from India, on arrival at Basrah, will ordinarily be free from all restrictions directly after medical examination and disinfection. The officers of the British India mail steamers will also be able to go ashore during their stay at Basrah, which they have been visiting without the possibility of landing for some 15 years. The abominable Basrah Lazaret will now claim fewer prisoners ; but its reorgani sation should not be neglected on that account, as an epidemic at any port nearer than India would bring it into use again. The change is stated to be due to the adhesion of Turkey to a new International Sanitary Convention lately framed at Paris. {C) Political. 20. The branch of the Committee* of Freedom and Accord at Baghdad , .o it -i i was recognised by the central organisation ♦See last Summary, II. 11. n P ,• f oo j to i at Constantinople on the 22nd February by telegram.

With reference to the forthcoming f elections for the Chamber it has , 0 TT |c, been officially laid down, for the second time, t See last Summary, ^ from Constantinople that the members of Arab tribes not living in towns or villages are disentitled to vote. The Wali, as is natural, is using his influence on the side of the Committee of Union and Progress, to which he belongs. There is no doubt a fear that, if his party goes out, he may lose his appointment. It will be a great misfortune if in Turkey the executive appointments throughout the Empire come to be regarded as at the disposition of every new party successful at the polls. The want of continuity in Turkish ad ministration is serious enough already, and an acute aggravation of it would be frightful. In Greece, I understand, the system of party spoils is followed, to the great detriment of the administration ; and there are some who think that Turkey is about to imitate Greece in this matter.

III. 10. ^ ^ of ^ ^^ ’Ashair. C11FD6 2. According to statements of travellers arriving at Baghdad from Persia,* the Nationalists recovered possession of Kirmanshah about the 9th of February. The Salar-ud-Daulah, it would appear, was encamped outside the town at the time. On hearing of the advance of Yar Muhammad Khan, a Nationalist leader, from the direction of Hamadan, the Salar sent a force to encounter him ; but Yar Muhammad Khan, who had good local information, left the high road near Bisai- tun, slipped through the hills, and entered Kirmanshah by night. He had only a small number of men with him, but they established themselves in some houses and at daylight opened a noisy fire with their rifles. This led to the flight, inde pendently, of the Salar, of Daud Khan, and of a son of Farrukh Khan, each of whom seems to have supposed when he heard the firing that he had been betrayed by his own associates. In the evening, however, the three fugitives found them selves together at the same place—Mahidasht, the first stage on the road towards Baghdad. Recovering confidence, they subsequently tried to re-take Kirman shah, but were repulsed with loss. After this they camped at Manzilah, a place immediately to the east of Kirmanshah. According to one account an engagement took place between the Salar’s men and Yar Muhammad’s force, consisting of 200 Bakhtiyaris and 200 Fidais, at the Qarasu Bridge. In it the Royalists were defeated and the Sharaf-ul-Mulk of Sinna, an important Kurdish chief fighting on their side, met his death ; but it is not clear whether this alleged battle preceded or followed the re-occupation of Kirmanshah by the Nationalists. It may have been, identical with the Salar s attack, after his flight, upon Kirmanshah. According to a telegram received here at the middle of February the Farman Farma had then arrived at Hamadan on his way to assume the governorship of Kirmanshah, and the Nationalists had arrested Agha Muhammad Mehdi, Agha Rahim, and Agha Mahmud, three leading Mullas of Kirmanshah who wer 5 supposed to be anti-nationalists. The fact seems to be that the A zam-ud- Daulah, the Nationalist governor of Kirmanshah, who had taken refuge in the British Consulate and remained quiescent during the Salar s occupation, woke to vigorous life on the latter s departure. *See last Summary, III. 2. Mujtahids* assembled at Kadhimain are said to have telegraphed to the A’zam-ud-Dauleh to spare the lives of their brethren of the cloth, but apparently in vain, for it is understood that Aghas Rahim and Mahmud have been put to death with another Mulla possibly Agha Muhammad Mehdi, the most important of the three. The latest reports state that the men of the late Sharaf-ul-Mulk, who are Sunnis, are avenging the death of their chief by pillaging the neighbourhood of Kirmanshah. 2. Such being the condition of affairs above, the Baghdad-Kirmanshah roadf is again of course closed ; and His fSee last Summary, III. 7. Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah and I have ceased to correspond by letter except on matters of routine. I have ako stopped sending political news by post to His Britannic Majesty s Legation at Tehran At the end of January Mr. McDouall had not been able to write to LmTn for a month and had not received a post from the Hamadan side for a fortnight. Great loss and inconvenience are being caused to many in this country by the closing of the road and the disorders at Kirmanshah. Various Baghdad merchants, mostly Jews, have received news of the plunder of goods belonging t^ them at or near Kirmanshah; and 5,000 loads of merchandise which had crossed the Persian frontier and reached Quasr-i-Shirm cannot proceed beyond tha,t point. About 100 loads belonging to prominent Baghdad traders are believed to have been taken at the Makkari Khan, in the outskirts of Kirmanshah, probably by Kurds (The circumstances are not clear ; but there now are wild rumours that the Sekr recovered Kirmanshah on the 29th February and that the bazaars and Khans 6 there have all been looted. The Persian Consulate-General at Beohdad is without information of events other than that possessed^ by the general public.) Trade to Persia is at a standstill, and many of the Baghdad7 firms engaged in it are said to be on the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the loss or locking up of their goods. There are also said to be three or four thousand returning Persian pilgrims collected at Khanaqin, who are afraid to recross the frontier; and there are believed to be about three thousand others delayed at Kadhimain, Karbala and Najaf, who are without means, having spent their money and being unable to obtain more by remittances from Persia. Due deduction must no doubt be made for the exaggerations inevitable at such a time as the present, but the position is undoubtedly a serious one for many thousands of persons. As regards actual occurrences in Persia, the facts are no doubt being reported to Government by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah. The principle point for consideration at Baghdad is the probible action of the Turkish autho rities. Since the end of February, viz., on the 3rd March, the Jewish merchants of Baghdad tmding to Persia have interviewed the Wali with reference to their business. He possibly held out to them hopes of Turkish military protection for caravans beyond the Turkish frontier, but obviously he cannot act in the matter without the orders of his Government, nor until there are sufficient Turkish troops at Khanaqin for the purpose. I do not believe that either of these conditions is as yet fulfilled; but, in case of a sudden forward movement being attempted by the Turks hereafter, I have thought it well to apprise His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassidor at Constantinople by telegram of the possibility. The trade which is suffering is largely a British trade passing through native channels ; and in any case I doubt whether, in the circumstances, it would become a civilised power to obj 3 ct to temporary measures by Turkey for the protection of commerce in transit between her own frontier and the nearest large trade centre in Persia. But precautions would need to be taken against the temporarv measures becoming a stepping-stone to a permanent occupation by the Turks of Persian territory. Captain Hore-Ruthven,* who has just returned from Khanaqin, saw no *s PP v *5 bPiow Turkish troops there ; but in coming to Baghdad he met about 30 cavalry and 70 infantry, apparently on their way thither. I am inclined, therefore, to think that only the Frontier Company and one of the cavalry detachments mentioned in the Annexuref to this report have as yet fSee Annexure A. | 3een gen ^ an( j ^ 2 n d Battalion of the 112th Regiment is not at Khanaqin as suggested in the annexure. 3. The Amir Afkham and his two sons, Persian refugees, whose deportation jSee last Summary, in. 4 . Constantinople had been ordered, J seem to have obtained a reversal of the decrees. They then proceeded to return from Aleppo to Baghdad; but the Wali of Baghdad caused them to be stopped at ’Anah on the Euphrates, having appa rently strong objections to their presence at the provincial capital. They are said to be now at Samarra. This case has given rise to a strong antagonism between the Persian Consul-General at Baghdad and the Wali. Another Persian refugee, Aman Ullah Khan, said to be a notable from Hamadan, was arrested in the principal mosque atKadhimainonthe21stof February by the Turkish authorities. X 4. The gathering§ of Mujtahids at Kadhimain had not yet dispersed at the §See last Summary, ill. 2 . enc ^ February. The Mujtahids have probably indulged in a good deal of tele graphing to all possible and impossible quarters ; but otherwise they have not had much to do, and one of them, Miraz Muhammad Taqi of Samarra, has sought to beguile the time by composing and publishing an exhortation to Muhammadan unity. It is a Mujtahid manifesto of the usual type, addressed to the people of Persia and all good Muslims ; and, though it is the first at which Mirza Muhammad Taqi has tried his hand, it is no more likely to be effective than those by other Mujtahids which have preceded it. There were rumours at one time of a secret official mission from the Wali of Baghdad to the Mujtahids assembled at Kadhimain ; but, though some Turkish officials visited them, there is nothing to show that these persons were sent by the Wali. The Shaikh of Muhammerahwho is always polite, early sent a telegram to the Mujtahids’ conclave, professing his entire readiness and that of his people to obey their behests. 5. ’Aziz Bey, the Turkish Qaim-Maqam of Najaf, who made himself ob noxious* by his agitations there in con- ♦See last Summary, III. 2. nection with Persian affairs, has disappeared from the official scene. A telegram is said to have been received by the Wali from the Minister of War ordering the payment of £.T.100 to ’Aziz Bay for the purpose of enabling him to reach Tripoli; but some think that ha will not make a serious endeavour to get further than Eg&gt;pt with the money. The Najaf appointment is now filled by Ibrahim Nagi, son of Yusuf, Suwaidizadah, who has earned for himself a good reputation as Qaim-Maqam of Kadhimain. 6.

It has been publicly read in an official assembly at Amadiyah, the headquarters of the districts, and any obstruction which may here after be offered to the Mission must consequently be of an unavowed character. 2. The first voyage of a Euphrates and Tirgris Steam Navigation Company’s vessel up the Euphrates with materials]! IjSee last Summary, v. 6. f or the Barrage was made in February by the * Ishtar ” launch, Captain Cowley, with a barge or barges. It proved an adventurous and even dangeous one. The best route was found to be by the old Euphrates, ^.e., via Qurnah and the Hammar marshes. Between Hammar and Nasiriyah the “ Ishtar ” was stopped by Shaikh Sa’dun, chief of the Bani Khigan, a petty tribe, who at first demanded that a barge belonging to her should be sunk ^ e ^ lve ^ as a dam to improve irrigation. This was the Arab way of opening a debate about blackmail. Captain Cowley repfied in the Arab style, of which he is a past master, that he had unfortunately no slings to unload the barge ; but the unexpectedly severe reply on this occasion was that, if necessary, a sling would be made of his body. To this, I believe, he merely answered Bismillah ( Begin -) and the discussion then took a more financial turn. The Shaikh was afraid of Captain Cowley’s slipping away by night, the negotiations being still unfinished and he at first required that the “ Ishtar’s ” propeller should be taken off and placed in his charge; but thispropsal too was successfully resisted. At length the issues were narrowed down to the question of a payment of £.T. 50; and Captain Cowley wap, sucessful, after giving £.T. 32 in cash and throwing open every closed receptacle on board to show that he had no more money, in getting leave to proceed. A pronuse was also extorted from him that he would not report the matter. On reaching Baghdad, to which he came by land from the Barrage he had of course to inform his employers’ representative of what had occurred , and Mr. T d, the local manager of Messrs Lynch and of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, in his turn wired on the subject to London. The result was a com- nkiid to the Porte, and the further result was a telegram from Constantinople to the Wall of Baghdad which seems to have implied that that official was m some wav to blame. The Wali, who was already annoyed at the insult to the Tu flag' and at the loss of £.T. 32 which will be included in Sir J. Jackson s bill together with commission (if not waived) at 15 per cent., resented such indirect and rapid procedure ; and his feelings were shared by Mr. Whitley, Sir J. Jackson’s local representative, who thought that the Wali and he himself should have been consulted by Mr. Tod before a complaint leading to action at Constantinople had been lodged. Mr. Tod, I understand, telegraphed to his firm for information only, and did not contemplate any action by them which would involve disagree able consequences for the Wali. Captain Cowley has since returned safely to Basrah with the “ Ishtar ” ; but a second voyage to the Barrage will not, Mr. Tod assures me, be attempted until Shaikh Sa’dun has been called to account. That savage is said to levy £.T.15 a month on each of Agha Ja’far’s Euphrates steamers for the privilege of passing his village. I do not know yet what steps it is proposed to take against him. ♦See L 5 above. Possibly the Army Corps Commandant’s* journey down the Euphrates is connected with the present insecurity of navigation on that river. 3. On the 17th February I received a visit from a young Persian gentlemen, ’Abdul ’Ali Khan, Sadiq-us-Saltaneh, who spoke English fluently and informed me that he was an Imperial Persian Commissioner for the affairs of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He told me that he had been employed in that capacity in London, where he was also attached to the Persia,n Legation ; that he had been at the Delhi Coronation Darbar ; that he had since officially inspected the proceedings of the Oil Company at ’Abbadan and Muhammerah, and had found them to be in strict accordance—contrary to what had been reported in some quarters—with the terms of their concession ; that he was shortly going to visit Ahwaz and the Company’s oil fields in that direction; and that he would travel from there to Tehran and so back to London. 4. On the 23rd February Muhammad Amir Khan, an official of the Rampur State in India, came to see me ; he brought a letter of introduction from Colonel Manifold, I.M.S. It seemed that the object of his journey to Baghdad was to buy horses for the Nawab of Rampur, and I found that he intended to rely al together on the assistance of the Naqib of Baghdad and his relations in the matter. A grandson of the Naqi,b was lately a ■fSee . e ow. guest f of the Nawab of Rampur, and this is a convenient opportunity for the Naqib to show his appreciation of the hospitality shown to the boy. 5. Mr. Percival Landon of the “ Daily Telegraph ” and Captain the Hon. A. G. A. Hore-Ruthven, V. C., of the 1st (King’s) Dragoon Guards airived at Baghdad from India on the 15th February. Both were proceeding to England, and their idea was to travel home together via Baghdad, Kirmanshah, and Tehran. Captain Ruthven was seriously indisposed at the time of his arrival; but on the 26th February, Mr. Landon having in the meanwhile made a flying tour to Babylon, the Hindiyah Barrage and Karbala, they were able to start in carriages for the Persian frontier. 6. On the night of the 29th February, towards the close of Messrs. Blockey, Cree &amp; Co’s usual cinematograph entertainment, the police suddenly arrested the native clerk in charge on pretext of the violation of an order to close places of amusement in honour of the Prophet’s birthday. No such order had been communicated to Messrs. Blockey, Cree and Co., nor were they aware of the existence of one ; and some menbers of the police force had themselves been present during the exhibition which there was therefore no reason to think was officially disapproved. The clerk—a respectable man—was taken to a police post, struck, and eventually dismissed with a warning that he would be treated much more severely another time if he ventured, in reliance on the foreign nationality of his employers, to argue with the police. A messenger brought the news to Mr. Cree at the Wali’s house, where he and and I were dining that evening ; but Mr. Cree had the tact to say nothing about the matter at the time. The next morning he gave me a carefully worded statement of the bare facts, and this I have sent to the Wilayat with the mere experession of a hope that the matter will be investigated and that I may be informed of the result. The incident may be regarded as a belated ebullition of feelings in which the C11FDBaghdad police were being sedulously nurtured from a year to two years ago and there is e\ ery hope that the W ali will not attempt to condone it. VI. British Official Matters. 1. I had a very satisfatory private interview with Jamal Bey, the Wali of Baghdad, at his residence on the 14th February. No third person was present. My object m seeking the interview was to remove all misunderstanding and ini tiate, if possible, cordial relations between us. Our conversation, which lasted about a hour and a half covered almost the whole field of common interests ; and hough differences of opinion must of course occu^ from time to time, an excellent working entente has been to all appearance established. I left the house with a much more favourable opinion of Jamal Bey’s character and business capacity than 1 had brought; and I hope that he on his part has been assured as to the perfect unaggressiveness of British policy in this country, and will regard me in future as something else than a designing foreign agent. n 2 *^ dress da nce was given at the Kesidency on the 19th February. Uver 100 invitations were issued, and between 80 and 90 guests were present. No invitations were issued to Muhammadans, the practice introduced in Nazim Pasha’s tpne of treating the higher Turkish officials as Europeans having proved inconve- xuent. This was f,he most difficult point which I had to handle at the interview with the Wali on the 14th, but it was Satisfactorily disposed of. The public* scandal *See II. 16 above, wfyich has lately arisen regarding Jamal ■ri ‘ -d i i i . Be y hinself and the wife of a prominent Jiuropean at Baghdad was an unmentioned but insuperable barrier to discussion on his part The reason which I assigned for not inviting the Wali and his staff was of course the least disagreeable of those governing the case, viz., the opinion of the ordinary Muhammadan public as to the propriety of dances. 3 The Wali entertained several of the European Consuls, among them my sell, at a private dinner at his house on the 29th February. Three weeks pre viously he had declined an invitation to dine with me on the ground of the conti nuance of the Italo-Turkish war- but our interview of the 14th February had not then taken place. J 4. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal is employing his spare time m revising the War Office map of the Musal neighbourhood by means of a prismatic compass. This is a most useful task to have undertaken, for the map in question though excellent of its kind, contains many of the mistakes and omissions inseparable from compilations. There is a mass of topographical notes and obser vations taken by me on a journey from Baghdad to Musal and back in 1910 which want of time has as yet prevented my completely writing up ; but these, when thrown into shape, will with Mr. Hony’s work render possible some improvement of the existing sheets. r 5. The handling of the British mail by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Na\ igation Company has lately attracted attention as not altogether satisfactory. In the latter half of 1910 the usual day of arrival of the mail, which reaches Basrah on Thursday as a rule, was Thursday of the following week at Baghdad ; in the latter half of 1911 it was Saturday. Taking the average voyage from Basrah to Baghdad at 5 days, the mail ought to arrive at Baghdad on Tuesday ; there has thus been a delay which has increased in the last year from 2 to 4 days, and sometimes it has amounted to 5 and 6 days. It is obvious that the the British Government do not P'-y a subsidy of £1,600 a year, or £30 a voyage, merely in order thaf the Company may forward the m rils at their own convenience ; nor was the condition in the contract imposing a penalty of £ 1 for every hour’s avoidable delay intended to be a dead letter. I have brought the increasirg delay gently to the notice of the Company’s local manage^, and I hope that nothing more will be required in order to bring about an improvement. The recent accelerationf of the Turkish post makes the time taken by the fSee Summary for November 1911 , u, n. Bril ish pof^t a matter of importance.

On the 15th January a See n . a ove. militant ecclesiastic arrived at Baghdad from Basrah with 25 Holy Warriors whom h 3 had recruited at the latter place. He preached in Baghdad, where he succeeded in enrolling another 25, mostly Indians and Afghans, from the Shaikh quarter, £.T. 300 is said to have been granted by the Committee of Union and Progress at Basrah for the purpose of forwarding the con tingent to Tripoli. It is understood that the Indians and Afghans mostly intend to desert at Aleppo, after having had their expenses paid so far, and then to go on pilgrimage to Madinah, etc. The Mulla and his flock left in the direction of Musal on the 2nd February. Turkey is not spending much directly on the war with Italy, and this may be held to justify a little extravagance in forwarding picturesque volunteers. On the 29th February the Wali received a telegram from Colonel ’Askari fBey, , who commanded f a column on the Eu- fSee Summary for October 1911,1. 3. pirates last year, announcing that he had arrived safely in Tripoli. ’Askari Bey is an energetic young officer and will be worth many hundreds of Mujahidin to the Turkish cause in Tripoli. 5. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal informs me that his French colleague has received instructions to avoid too close a connection with the Chal dean Catholic Patriarch at Musal. If these are observed it will be possible for the British representative in future to escape the role of champion of the Nestorians, which has hitherto been more or less forced upon him, chiefly by old tradition. It seems very undesirable that the warring Christian sects at Musal should be support ed, even unofficially, by the representatives of foreign powers. The advent of the railway at Musal by and by will probably make a great change m the place and diminish the importance of sectarian contests by introducing commercial and other rivalries. 6 Mr Orloff Imperial Russian Consul-General at Baghdad, left his headquarters for a tour’on the 2nd March. He told me that he intended to visit Baladmz and Badrah, to strike the Tigris at Kut, and possibly from there to travel down to Basrah He probably wishes to study the position of affairs on an interesting and little known part of the Persian frontier ; but my German colleague remarks, not without reason, that Mr. Orloff’s tours always include some place-in the present case Mandali—at which oil or bitumen is found, and that he may be working in the Russian oil interest. Mr. Orlofi has already visited Kirkuk and Hit. VIII. Commercial matters. 1 After some correspondence with the Director, Commercial Intelligence Branch Board of Trade, I have made further enquiries here about signs* of American T i mn vttt *1 activity in connection with the Baghdad +See Summary for July 1911, VIII, J. mar ket. I find that only in a few cases have goods been received here from America via Manchester on the same freights that would have been charged from England. The principal instance is a large13 consignment of American beer : the shipping Company on the Atlantic seem to have been Messrs. Lamport and Holt; the line carrying from Manchester wis British, and so was the importing firm at Baghdad. The rates in the cases discovered were probably special, and British lines seem to have received the freights, at any rate on this side of Manchester. It appears, however, that the American Minister at Tehran was very much exercised, some time ago, about developing American trade in these regions ; and that he was then trying to induce some American line to arrange sailings to the Persian Gulf. The American Consulate at Baghdad was plied by him with demands for statistical and other information, but their nature showed that the commercial situation was not at all understood by the Legation at Tehran and that the ideas of the Minister were academic. It seems to have imagined, among other things, that goods landed at Basrah found their way direct into Persia without passing through Baghdad. 2. The confusion and disorder prevailing in the Bag! .dad Customs House now baffle description. Early in the month I visited the place to see it for myself. Owing to the limited amount of the space goods were piled up in places 12 and 15 feet deep, and there was no means of ascertaining what goods there were in the lower strata. In the circumstances it is not wonderful that articles are mislaid for indefinite periods, or altogether lost. I found the clearing agent of a British firm wandering about with a document covering only 3 packages in his band : one of these had been found at one end of the Customs House, one at the other, and the third could not be found at all. The deficiency of the staff is also a great impediment to proper work. It some times takes days before papers relating to goods can pass one particular clerk. I sat for a time with the Mudir in his glass box in the middle of the Customs House and sincerely pitied his lot. It was evening, and he seemed dazed by the day’s work; but his window was stdl fronted by a howling and gesticulating crowd, waving documents to which they demanded his attention. Merchants may be excused if sometimes they grow nearly desperate, and the Customs House authorities do not seem to be seriously to blame, though I think that, with a little more intelligence and system in the arrangement of goods received, some improvement might be effected. The Mudir told me that application had been made to Constantinople for ten additional employes. As he said that he would be glad of British support, I ventur ed to telegraph to Hi,s Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople suggest ing that the desired increase might be recommended. The Nazir of Customs, it should be explained, is ill with typhoid, and I had to deal with the Mudir in his place. The question of enlarged premises is more difficult. It is quite reasonable that the choice of a site for a new Customs House elsewhere which seems to have been decided on in principle, should be postponed until th3 location of the Railway sta tion is settled. I fear that little or nothing can be done to improve the present Customs House, but, with an increased staff, an additional exit and entrance could perhaps be opened which would relieve to some extent the hopeless jostling and blocking of men, animals, and enormous bales of goods in the narrow corridors of the ancient University building. 3. A general store has been opened at Musal in which Messrs. Lynch’s agent, Mr. M. Thaddeus, is an unavowed partner. It will deal only in British goods. This is a step in the right direction. I lately tried to induce Messrs. ’Abdul ’Ali Brothers, the enterprising British Indian Merchants at Baghdad, to turn their attention to Ml i sal i ^ ® uc_ cess. They have a great many irons in the fire already at Baghdad, Karbala, etc., and, if they were to extend their business, they would naturally prefer to do so w the easier direction of Basrah and Muhammarah.

There has been a slight renewal of the Bani * Lam troubles. Early in * s« Summary for February—March i 9 ii t iv, i. January the ex-Shaikh Ghadhban, who now has his abode on the Tib under the Persian hills, raided flocks and herds belonging to the loyal Shaikh Ju’ai; but a pursuit party recovered the animals taken. I received this news while on tour on the Tigris, the north bank of which between ’Amarah and Kut was then enlivened by armed contingents of the army of defence returning to their villages or celebrating their victory with songs and war dances. A small detachment of Turkish troops had been stationed at Kumait for the protection of that place and its neighbourhood. The Mutasarrif of ’Amarah, a new official, whom I had found much depressed by the troubled state of the country, wrote me later (on the 24th January) that the despatch of troops to Kumait had had a good effect, and that the situation was daily improving. 2. There is no news from the Muntafik t country, which probably means . c c , _ v T » things are fairly quiet there. A military man has, however, been appointed Mutasarrif of the Muntafik district in the person of Lieutenant-Colonel Farid Bey, a staff officer of the Baghdad Cavalry Brigade. Nothing is known yet as to how the news of the death l of Sa’dun Pasha has been received by the tribe. Towards the end of January the Turkish gunboat “ Marmaris ” and one of the new armed motor launches from Basrah were up the Euphrates near Madinah. The reason was said to be fighting between the Bani Malik, who are near neighbours of the Muntafik, and an adjoining tribe. 3. Some £. T. 8,000 appears to have been lately § collected in taxes £ q q . „ , 1Q11 T* from the Jaf Kurds, who live near the Persian border between Sulaimamyah and Khanaqin. Mahmud Beg, the Chief of the Jaf, who had been allowed to return home, is now again at Musal; his presence there is said to have reference to a scheme for inducing his tribe to give up their migratory habits; but His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul believes it to be connected with Turkish policy on the Persian frontier. 4. It is stated that the force of civil police in Baghdad City will be increased from 70 to 200 men, and that four public-spirited citizens have undertaken the cost of building four new police stations in the town. These satisfactory prospects are attributed to the representations and influence of the Wali, Jamal Bey. The public security has of late left something to be desired at Baghdad. £ See last Summary, I, 1. II.— Turkish Affairs. Military. || See Summary for August 1910, II, 2. •[[ See last Summary, I, 6. 1. Towards the end of December the Nishanji battalion which had been stationed at Najaf || since August 1910 was recalled to Baghdad. This seems to show that the effects of xlskari Bey’s expedition to the Euphrates last autumn are expected to be lasting. 2. In the second week of January some 800 rifles with ammunition were brought from Baghdad to Karbala and placed in the local arsenal. They were probably new or additional arms for the Kadif of the Karbala Division.3. The Commander of the Baghdad Army Corps lately told me that he had no reason to think that the Field Artillery of his command were about to be rearmed with a new quick-firing gun, though other Army Corps were receiving one. He said that in his opinion Field Artillery was not wanted in Mesopot amia, being difficult to move in such a country and unnecessarily powerful for the work required here. If the quick-firing mountain gun on which he relies (and of which the Baghdad Corps now possesses several) is as efficient as the weapon of the Indian Mountain Batteries, his contention is probably correct. The Arab “ forts ” in this province are for the most part very flimsy affairs and would not, I think, resist artillery fire as the solidly built burjs of the Indian North-West Frontier have been known to do. 4. The Turkish Naval Commander at Basrah lately assured me that the draft of the new (Thornycroft) armed launches here is not so great as I had been told ;* I understood from him that * See Summary for October 1910, II, 3. ft wa§ only about 3 feet . He Said, hoW- ever, that they had two great defects in view of the duties required of them : first, that they were too low to command the banks except in a very high river, but would be themselves commanded; and, second, that the protection for the men working the guns was quite insufficient and could not be increased without spoiling the boats. For these faults, of course, not the makers but those who ordered the launches are to blame. 5. The question of the Turkish fort at Faot is supposed to have been t See last Summary, n, 16. discussed at Baghdad during the recent J t Ditto 1 , 2 . yi s it there of the Wall of Basrah. On his return to Basrah the Wali went to Fao and personally inspected the Fort. It is probable that nothing more will be heard of this matter, for there are signs that the Turkish craze about British designs in this part of the world is at last passing away. Civil. 6. The M'ali of Baghdad made a flying tour in December or January to the Khalis, an irrigated tract lying a short distance to the north of Baghdad. Jamal Bey has already creditably distinguished himself among Baghdad VY alls by his activity § in making himself per- § See Summary for November 1911, II, 7. J na]ly aC( j ua i„ted with different parti of his province, and it is understood that he is n&lt;^ arranging for a tour to Samarra. 7. The Wali is said to have volunteered for military service in Tripoli and to have received from his Government the reply that he could not be spared from Baghdad. This news appeared in the “ Zuhur,” a local paper. 8. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal reports that much money (£. T. is the sum mentioned) has been spent on the Turkish scheme for irrigation from the Great Zab and that R See Summary for June 1910, V, !4. uothin | has been done. The opinion || which I formed on my tour to the Zab country in the spring of 1910 seems justified by the result. 9. B,enewed^[ efforts are being made, this time at Karbala, to put an end to the circulation of 'foreign silver. The ' only means adopted so far has been public proclamation of the order. The supply of Turkish silver is still inadequate, in this province, to the needs of the market; but it has greatly improved during the last two years. Political. 10. During the last three months a very decided change has become perceptible in the attitude of the Turkish officials, which is now tolerant and reasonable. This may be attributed, as regards internal affairs, to the weakening of the still dominant Committee of Union and Progress, whose nominees most of the present high officials are, by the rise of a new Liberal party. In matters affecting foreigners the change may certainly be traced to the bitter lessons of the war with Italy. Italy, no doubt with selfish ends in view and at great cost to herself, has in fact corrected the excesses of Turkey in the interests of all Europe.3 At Baghdad local factors also have been at work. The chief of these is undoubtedly the firm attitude assumed by His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment in connection with their claim to compensation for the immoveable property of British subjects illegally destroyed in the Baghdad Wilayat in 1910, which has now produced a satisfactory settlement. The submission of the Turkish Government to the British demands, which during more than a year were not so much contested as trifled with, has had a profound effect on the minds of all classes. The French Consul at Baghdad has gone so far as to congratulate me on the successful stand made by the British Government, by which, he said, all European ‘Powers with subjects to protect here will be great gainers. W hat is more remarkable is that wholesome correction still seems to purge malice, as well as folly, from the Oriental mind. I have been much struck by the increase of friendliness and courtesy towards myself; and my German and Austrian colleagues report similar experiences. At ’Amarah on the Tigris, where last year the Mutasarrif made a polite excuse for not receiving me at all, his successor gave me a hearty welcome, talked about the affairs of his district with a freedom unknown here since Nazim Pasha’s arrival, glori fied England as the true political exemplar of Turkey—a compliment which has long been out of fashion, and even wrote me a private letter after my arrival at Baghdad. At Kut the Qaim-Maqam was all consideration, though less communicative than the Mutasarrif; he was an old acquaintance. The Qaim-Maqam of ’Aziziyah seemed lost to all consciousness of the flight of time when he returned my visit on board the “ Comet.” Even the Wali of Baghdad, since my arrival after 2J months’ absence, has begun to show a much more favourable side of his official character. I believe he has had orders from high quarters to cultivate good relations with me which he is doing his best to carry out, and he shall have no reason to complain of the absence of a response on my part. The Commander of the Baghdad Army Corps, a few days since, came round to see me after dark and remained for a long tete-a-tete over the drawing room fire. 11. Permission has been received at Baghdad for the formation of a local branch of the Committee of Freedom and Accord (Hurriyah wa Itilaf). This new Committee seems to consist partly of the Ahrar or Original Liberals, partly of members * of the already * See Summary for September 1911, n, is. defunct Moderate Liberal Committee, and + See Summary for July 1910, v, 14. partly of seceders from the Committee of Union and Progress. The Committee + of Union and Progress itself is rapidly declining here. Shukri-l-Fazli Effendi, one of its leading lights, has lately withdrawn from it, and violent attacks on it have been appearing in the local press. 12. Preparations for the election of members of the Chamber for the next Parliament have already begun at Baghdad. The contest between the Union and Progress party and its opponents will be most interesting and instructive to watch and is likely to be stiff. On the one hand the Wali and other influential officials are partisans of the Committee of Union and Progress, from whom they received their appointments ; on the other the Arab, Persian, and Christian voters, so far as left to themselves, are likely to favour the present opposition which is less chauvinestically Turk. III.— Persian Affairs. 1. If real political importance still attaches to the Mujtahids of Karbala and Najaf, their opinions, and their doings—a highly doubtful proposition + c c TTT the death l of the Mujtahid Mulla Kazim (Khurasani) of Najaf is an event of great significance. The deceased was politically the most active of all the Mujtahids ; in energy and self-confidence he was superior to all his colleagues; and his name was perhaps the most widely known in the Shi’ah ecclesiastical world. His proceedings during the last two years have filled a large space in my reports. Among the Mujtahids who remain there appears, at present, to be no man distinguished by ability or force of character. Shaikh ’Abdullah (Mazandarani), who was associated with Mulla Kazim in most of his numerouspronunciamentos, seems to be a colourless and insignificant individual. It is anticipated that with Mulla Kazim’s disappearance from the scene the futility oi the Mujtahids as political leaders will become more patent than before. 2. The agitation at Karbala and Najaf for a Jihad or general crescentade • See ia.t Summary, in, 5 . against the Russians in Persia, which appeared * to have come to an end on the death of Mulla Kazim, was suddenly revived towards the end of December. The cause was the stringent action of Russia in North Persia, especially at Tabriz, in consequence of which telegraphic appeals for co-operation seem to have reached the ’Ulama of the Holy Cities from Tehran and other places. Aziz Bey, the Turkish Qaim-Maqam of Najaf, who had previously distin- t See last Summary, III, 2. guished himself by extorting f a Patwa in favour of Jibad from the Mujtahid Saiyid Kazim (Yazdi), took a prominent part in the agitation and seems even to have mounted the pulpit himself in order to preach a Holy War. A very extreme speech was delivered in a crowded private house at Najaf, on the last day of 1911, by Shaikh Hasan, an official preacher of the Turkish Government. The sjieaker seems to have surprised even his sympathetic hearers by his violence ; he censured the Mujtahids for their failure to take action ; and, when it was suggested that some of them would not act along with the others, he shouted “ Kill them ! kill them ! kill them ! Clear the world of them and never mind who they are.” (The dissidents referred to were of course Saiyid Kazim (Yezdi), and his adherents.) After some days of intense excitement four Najaf Mujtahids, Shaikh ’Abdullah (Mazandarani), Shari’at (Isfahani), Saiyid Mustafa (Kashani) and Saiyid ’Ali Shah (’Abdul ’Azimi) took the road for Karbala, where they arrived on the 3rd January with a following of about 80 students. The Mazandarani was ill and travelled in a litter, before which was carried the flag of constitutional Persia, while the other Mujtahids were pr^c/eded by a couple of black triangular banners with inscriptions in white. The next day Saiyid ’Ali Damad, another Najaf Mujtahid, came in at Karbala with about 20 students ; he was followed on the 5th January by Shaikh Muhammad ’Ali (Khurasani), Shaikh Muhammad Husain (Qumshai), and Saiyid Muhammad Husain (Tehrani) with some additional students. Saiyid Kazim (Yazdi), however, remained inflexible in his determination not to leave Najaf. From the 5th to the 8th January daily gatherings were held in the courtyard of the principal shrine at Karbala, which were addressed by the Mujtahids and others, the Turkish official preacher Saiyid Hasan being again conspicuous. The last of these meetings was attended by the British Vice- Consul at Karbala; it consisted of about 2,000 persons, and the President of the local Committee of Union and Progress was among the speakers. At Najaf, in the meantime, the Turkish Qaim-Maqam was doing his best to maintain a ferment and had started a subcription in aid of volunteers for the front. The original idea of the militant Mujtahids was apparently to march straight to the scene of action in Persia, and Q,um seems to have been specified m telegrams which they received from Persia as a place of general rendezvous. On reflection, however, the possibility of their falling into the hands of the royalist Salar-ud-Daulah on the way to Kirmanshah occurred to them and greatly chilled their ardour; and eventually it was decided not to proceed further, in the first instance, than Kazimain near Baghdad. In regard to their general views at the time of their passing through Karbala the British Vice- Consul there reported to the Acting Resident as follows :— “ A secret idea however exists in the Mujtahids that if the partition of Persia was found inevitable, in the existing circumstances their last recourse should be to invite the English to take possession of the whole country and drive out the Prussians by the co-operation of Persia, but they are not sure whether England could take such step in spite ( ? view) of the Anglo-Russian Agreement. They prefer the English because they admit that under her (? their) rule they will enjoy a greater amount of toleration and justice than they will do under the Russians. Probably they will approach you on thissubject either openly or in disguise through somebody to ascertain the possi bility of its being put to practice.” By the 9th January the principal Najaf Mujtahids already mentioned and their followers had reached Kazimain ; among them Mirza Mehdi, the son of the late Mulla Kazim. On the 14th Saiyid Jsma’il (Sadr-ud-Din), the greatest Mujtahid of Karbala, had arrived ; and about the 31st, after much persuasion, Mirza Muhammad Taqi (Shirazi), a celebrated Mujtahid who lives at Samarra, joined the assembly. There were now, according to the best accounts, about 500 strangers at Kazimain, chiefly Mujtahids and students, whom the political situation in Persia had caused to assemble there. Two Committees were formed at Kazimain, one open and one secret. The members of the latter were Shaikh ’Abdullah (Mazandarani), Shari’at ( Isfaham), Saiyid Isma’il iSadr-ud-Din^, Saiyid Mustafa (Kashani), and Mirza Muhammad Taqi of Samarra. from which it would appear that they are the most influential participators in the movement. Much telegraphing in cypher to Tehran and ( onstantinople by the Persian Consulate-General followed, evidently on behalf of the Committees, and the latter seem also to have made an appeal to the Sultan of Turkey through the Wall of Baghdad. The attitude of the Turkish Government in regard to the Mujtahid agita tion seems to have been on the whole correct. The official preacher, Saiyid Hasan, does not appear to have been reprimanded by the local authorities, as he ought to have been ; but the Qaim-Maqam of Najaf, whose vagaries have been mentioned, relinquished his post before the end of the month, having been cither removed in disgrace at the instance of the Russian Consulate-General, as some suppose, or else simply obliged by his Government to go on leave. The meetings in the shrine at Karbala did no harm, the general public there being indifferent ; and it is no doubt due to Turkish official influence that the Committees at Kazimain have abstained from inflammatory appeals and even from public meetings. 3. Hie Ashraf-ul-Mulk, a leading member of the ruling family of Pusht- i-Kub, arrived at Baghdad on the 30th January with some 90 followers. Ostensibly he has come to this country on pilgrimage. He is a mere boy and seems to he a younger son or a grandson of Husain Quli Khan, the late M ali of Pusht-i-Kuh. ' The present ruler of that Persian province is Ghulam Riza Khan, a son of the deceased Husain Quli Khan, to whose titles of Sarum-us- Saltanah and Amir Jang he has succeeded. 4. The Persian refugees whose presence * here was reported lately, viz., , o 0 . -yr . t T t n OT \A w the Azd-ud-Daulah, the Amir Afkham * See Summary for November III, 2, and last 1 o • • i 4 i i ™ , Summary, in, e. with his two sons and Saiyid Akbar Shah, seem to have been sent out of the country in one party, by the Turkish authorities, under some degree of restraint or surveillance. They were despatched in the direction of Aleppo about the 26th December, and their destination was then said to be Constantinople. Before their expulsion they had been in communication at Baghdad, and the objection to their remaining seems to have been that they were all Persian royalists and were probably plot ting here against the present Persian Government. As a matter of fact, the Azd-ud-Daulah and his brother, the Salar-ud-Daulah, do not appear to have been yet reconciled, the latter considering that the former was guilty of disgraceful conduct in abandoning f Kirmanshah, of t See Summary for October i9ii, in, i. wliich he had been left in charge, after the royalist defeat at the end of last September. The Amir Afkham is under stood to he an important Chief of the Hamadan neighbourhood ; one of his sons is the Ihtisham-ud-Daulah. Saiyid Akbar Shah is a Wa’iz or preacher. 5. According to information received by His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul, Musal, the Salar-ud-Daulah telegraphed on the 5th January to the Sultan of Turkey, begging that Military action might not be taken against the Oramanli Kurds, whose Chief is Mahmud Khan; the telegram was despatched from Khanaqin. The Salar admitted that the tribe might be to blame, but urged that in the present crisis an expedition would have an unfortunate effect in Persia. As the Oramanli or Aoromanli Kurds are next neighbours to the Jaf and the name of the Jaf Chief is Mahmud, it is possible that the telegram refers to the question of taxing and settling j see i, 3 abuve. the Jaf, to which reference has been made above. I6 3 * See Summary for November 1911, II, 3. The inhabitants of the disputed tract on the Perso-Turkish frontier appear divided in their opinion as to the advantages of Turkish rule. In December 1911, the people of Sulduz had complained to Constantinople of misdeeds on the part of the Turkish Governors, and the Minister of War, Mahmud Shevket Pasha, ordered the Turkish Commissioner for Persian Frontier Affairs to report upon their grievances ; nevertheless in January there vere still threats of emigration from Sulduz to escape from official Turkish oppression. The people of Sujbulaq, on the other hand, were at the very same time plying the Porte with telegraphic demands for recognition as Turkish subjects, appa rently with the idea of placing themselves beyond the danger of a Itussian invasion. These facts were ascertained by Mr. Hony at Musal. In the East, and particularly in Turkey, the telegraph is the favourite weapon of agitators, it being easy for one man to telegraph in the name of a thousand ; and it would not be safe to attribute too much importance to the correspondence described above. The Turkish Commissioner for Persian Frontier Affairs, Colonel Paffq Bey, * is now at Baghdad. I was intro duced to him by the Wali at the latter’s private house and he has since called on me, but he is very reticent. 6. Niazi Beg, Turkish Consul at Kirmanshah, and ’Abdul Karim Beg, Turkish Consul at Silma, arrived at Baghdad in the last week of December. The object of their journey here is not known, but there is reason to think that the former will not return to Kirmanshah. 7. The road between Baghdad and Kirmanshah is once more open,t no t See last Summary in, 12 . doubt in consequence of the Salar-ud- X no. in, ii. Daulah’s occupation J of Kirmanshah; but naturally it is not regarded as secure, and in any case it will take a long time to work off the accumulation of goods for Persia lying at Baghdad. 8. A new Persian Consul-General in the person of Mukarram-as-Saltana e Q e TTT p arrived at Baghdad on the 2nd January. S See Summary for August 1911, III, 5. n i i* 8 j s &gt; &gt; Muntak hib-ul-M ulk, § whom he relieved, and who seems to have been removed for inefficiency, is still living at Baghdad, and the Muntakhib’s son is still Persian Vice-Consul here. The new Consul-General comes from Tehran, where he was attached to the Foreign Office. He is said to have entered the Persian Consular service at Constantino ple, to have been Consul at Erzeroum, Tiflis and Aleppo, and to have filled the post of Karguzar at Tabriz. He is said to speak Arabic and Turkish fluently, and he has made a good impression on the Persians here. One of his eight brothers, Biza Khan, was formerly dragoman in the German Consulate at Baghdad. IV. Centhal Arabian Affairs. Nil V. British Interests and Cases. 1.

This reparation, though tardy, has already had an excellent effect in rehabilitating British prestige and restoring confidence to British owners of immoveable property ; but its chief value lies in the guarantee which it affords against arbitrary interference in future with British tenements. The settle ment is also to be welcomed as removing the principal obstacle which existed to a good understanding between this Besidency and the Wilayat. 2. The satisfactory issue of Saiyid Muhammad’s case,^[ viz , the punish- „ a . . „ . VT 0 ment by the Turkish Courts of the Gen- .e as ummary, , . darmerie officer and private who illegally entered his house and maltreated him, will also be useful in preventing acts of violence hereafter on the part of the Turkish police towards British subjects. Its effect has just been exemplified in a case in which the Baghdad city police, being obliged to arrest a British subject, showed the greatest promptitude in seeking the co-operation of the Besidency, which was immediately afforded.7 3. A few matters still await settlement with the Turkish Government. Of these the most important is the claim * of Messrs. ’Abdul Ali Brothers for * See Summary for August 1911 , v, 6. compensation on account of illegal inter ference with their trade by Nazim Pasha in 1910. When this item has been recovered it is probable that British trade, as well as British immoveable property and personal rights, will cease to suffer from illegal Turkish interference. But for the present 1 have received a complaint from a British subject who owns a flour mill in Baghdad that Turkish employes have been entering his premises without reference to Consular authority and demanding payment of an unknown tax upon the mill under threat of making him close it, and that they have been intimidating Turkish subjects in order to prevent their having dealings w ith him. 4.

As it appeared, however, that the matter must be dealt with judicially not adminis^atively, w r hich meant probably months of delay, as there seemed little prospect even in the end of the money taken being recovered, and as the men had no means of subsistence in this country, I eventually sent them back to India on my own responsibility aud referred the item to the Charitable Committee, Karbala, for favourable consideration. 5. In pursuance of the arrangements X made in September last for the clearance of the Husainiyah Canal, the X See Summary for September 1911, I, 7. sum ^ recovered from the people of Karbala—or rather, as it proved, from the landowners upon the Canal itself— w r as apportioned by the local authorities among those whom they considered liable. Some of the landowners being British subjects the authorities ap proached the British Vice-Consul with reference to their contributions. The Vice-Consul applied to me for orders, and I instructed him that, as the proposed^ w ork w r as one of public utility, British subjects should contribute to it in the same manner as Ottoman subjects, it being distinctly understood that they did so by way of subscription and not in virtue of any legal obligation, also that the case should not form a precedent. Subsequently it appeared that the Govern ment did not intend to contribute anything to the work, as had been promised, but that they expected the landowners who had already subscribed money to provide labour also, the labourers to be paid (or partially paid) out of the money- collected. On the Vice-Consul’s making a second reference to me on this point and further reporting that the Turkish authorities wmuld not supply him with a list of the British subjects on whom contributions would have been levied had they been of Turkish nationality, I directed him to reply that the further request for labour could not be acceded to and that, if no list of the British landowners was forthcoming within a reasonable period, the offer of a subscription on their part would have to be withdrawn. The question is one in which caution is necessary in order to avoid official recognition of what is certainly an irregular impost, laudable though the object may be in the present case. 6 The operations of Sir John Jackson, Limited, the constructors of the r v o Hindiyah Barrage, are still § progressing § Sec Summary for September loi , , . favourably. The Wall’s visit to the Barrage was an unqualified success; he stayed there longer than had been expected The firm now meet with no obstruction on the part of the Turkish ^ ‘ , , iQiiv't authorities, who have at last withdrawn ,| See Summary for September .911, V,3. ^ to the traasport 0 f Barrage materials upon the Euphrates by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company as sub-contractors. I even hear that the AY ah has been re- nuesting Mr. Whitley, Sir John Jackson’s manager at Baghdad, to arrange for the carriage of ordinary cargo upon the Euphrates by means of the Lyneh steamer at his disposal. The Hahbaniyah work-an escape for the Euphrates floods js not advancing so fast as the Hindiyah Barrage. I gather that it involves a quantity of heavy cutting through hard ground winch requires machinery, and that the firm are indisposed to tackle it seriously until their prospects in this country are more assured. At Baghdad there is still no news of the intentions of the Turkish Govern- witl regard to the permanent contract for the execution of the Mosopo- tamian irrigation works, and it may well he that in the present unsettled state—T 8 ) of Turkish politics the Government have none. In Reuter’s telegrams, how ever, it was announced lately that the Porte contemplated taking only a third part of Sir William Willcocks’ projects in hand at the present time. This would undoubtedly be a wise decision, especially if, as Mr. Whitley assumes, the projects selected for immediate execution formed a natural group—e.^r., the Hindiyah Barrage, Habbaniyah Escape, and Eallujah Barrage, with their connected works. 7. So far as I know the question of what is to be done when the first Barrage is finished has not yet been faced by any one. I do not think that any detailed system of irrigation dependent on the Hindiyah Barrage has been designed by Sir William Willcocks. The Barrage will divide the water of the Euphrates between the Hindiyah and Hillah branches of that river ; but each of the branches will remain as before a natural stream and such landowners and cultivators as there are in its immediate vicinity will apparently be left to draw the water they require from its bed as best they can, viz., by horse lifts, oil pumps, rude channels, etc. A great deal more than this, of course, is required, if the work is to bring in a good return to the Turkish Government. Regular main canals and distributaries must be designed and constructed on descending levels, which will carry the water by gravitation to a distance from the river and extend cultivation far inland. This is a task requiring the best scientific skill and experience, and I do not see here any agency capable of performing it. Sir John Jackson, Ltd., are constructing engineers, not irrigation experts, and the Turks have probably no one with even a rudimentary knowledge of irrigation. There will also be the difficulty, far greater here than in India, of finding suitable labour to cultivate the new lands brought under irrigation ; and when it is found and settled on the land, the problem of a convenient and equitable system of taxation will arise. These questions of colonisation and taxation, equally with that of irrigation itself, are highly technical; and on the successful solution of all three will depend the financial result of the great enterprise on which the Turkish Government are now, with much hesitation, embarking. In India, where several large irrigation colonies have been formed during the last 15 years upon waste lands, truefly extraordinary results have been obtained. On my recent journey to Delhi I took advantage of the opportunity to visit the new but richly cultivated Lyallpur district in the Punjab, which has been brought into existence in the midst of a wilderness since my own first arrival in India. Since returning here I have done my best to explain to the Wali and the Assistant Wall the great financial possibilities of irrigation, if properly managed, and have supplied them with statistics from the Punjab Irrigation Department’s Annual Report for 1909-10. The principal figures for the Lower Chenab Canal are sufficiently surprising and may be cited here: Lower Chenab Canal. April 1909—March 1910. Capital directly or indirectly expended by Government since the commencement of the works about 18 years ago . Extent of irrigation in 1909-10— Autumn Spring .......... Total £ 1,899,194 Acres. 601,962 1,438,213 2,040,175 Gross revenue for the year Working expenses for the year 678,962 164,081 Net revenue for the year 514,881 making a return of 27 per cent, on capital, to the Government, in a single year. 3 It may be added that the population of the tract, which in 1892, when colonisation operations began, was mostly nomadic and numbered only some9 4 / 5,000 souls, is now almost entirely sedentary, exceeds 850,000 souls, and consists of perhaps the most prosperous agricultural classes in India. Villages and towns are springing up on every side, mill chimneys are rising alongside the railway, and the volume of agricultural exports is phenomenal. It is difficult to convey to a Turkish official, who has never seen good administration, an adequate idea of what has been attained in India, or of the science, organisation, and moral qualities which alone have made its attainment possible. There can be no doubt that what is required in Mesopotamia is expert advice and supervision, such as an Indian irrigation engineer and an Indian colonisation officer could supply. To suggest point-blank to the Wall that the services of two such officers should be obtained from India would probably be to excite political suspicions on his part; so I have confined myself for the present to trying to interest him and his Assistant in the subject, and to suggesting that delegates should be sent to India to see how things are managed there. I have little doubt that if any sort of mission were to go, which is not very probable, the result would ultimately he a request for assistance. I have further spoken to Mr. Whitley, who enjoys the Wall’s confidence, and who appreciates the magnitude of the interests involved ; and it occurs to me that his tirm might hereafter be able to secure a contract for irrigation and colonisation and that by their means the two British Indian experts mentioned might he brought in, perhaps as their employes. The son of Mr. Menahem Salih Daniel, one of the heads of the Jewish community at Baghdad and one of the greatest landowners in Mesopotamia, being at present in India, I have also given Mr. Daniel senior a letter of intro duction which his son may present to the Chief Secretary of the Punjab Government. A visit by Mr. Ezra Daniel, who is his father’s agricultural manager, to the Punjab colonies would probably make him a strong advocate of British Indian methods; and this again might contribute usefully, if indirectly, to the object in view, that of introducing British management in the Mesopotamian irrigation scheme. The Daniel family are wealthy, influential, and enlightened, and they have always shown much consideration for the British Itesidency at Baghdad. 8. The correspondent appointed by Beuter at Baghdad - Mr. A. W. M. Tod, who is also Messrs. Lynch’s Manager here—has been unable as yet to do much for the behoof of the news agency. Some telegrams about the assembling of the Mujtahids at Kazimain w T hich he tried to send were refused transmission. The same thing happened wdien his predecessor attempted to telegraph about the state of feeling at Baghdad at the beginning of the Italo-Turkish w r ar. Mr. Tod, however, is a man of resource and does not mean to be permanently baffled by the censorship. VI. —British Official Matters. 1. I had the honour of being invited by the Government of India to be present at the Imperial Coronation Durbar at Delhi as their guest in the Eoreign Office Camp along with Mrs. Lorimer. I left Baghdad on the 7th November and before going to Delhi I managed, as already mentioned, to pay a visit to the Lyallpur district in the Punjab and learn something at first hand about the methods of development employed in the Lower Chenab Canal Colony. Invaluable assistance was kindly given me in the same connection by the Civil Secretariat of the Punjab Government at Lahore, and the knowledge which I have gained will I hope be of service hereafter to British interests in Mesopotamia. I was at Delhi from the 4th to the 17th December. By permission of the Government of India I had brought with me, in charge of Mr. Abdur Babb Barq, Second Dragoman, two representatives of the British Indian community in Mesopotamia. These were Sajjad ’Ali Khan, son of the late Ahmad Ali Khan, and his relation Muhammad Taqi Khan. Sajjad ’Ali Khan took with him at his own expense his son ’Ali Khan, who is an Honorary Dragoman of this Besidency, as also his family physician. None of the gentlemen named had 219S F. D.10 before travelled outside Mesopotamia, except Muhammad Taqi Khan, who had visited Persia. They were naturally much astonished and impressed by all that they saw in India, and their devotion to the King-Emperor and their enthusiasm for British civilisation have received a stimulus which will react on the whole Indian Colony here and will make itself felt in Persian and Turkish circles as well. I arrived again at Muhammarah, where I was met by the “ Comet ” from Baghdad, on the 28th December. Prom Muhammarah, where I halted for a few days and visited the ’Abbadan station of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, I travelled to Basrah. There I conferred with Mr. Crow, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, on matters of common interest, exchanged visits with the Wali—unfortunately without seeing him—and made the acquaintance of the Turkish Naval Commodore. On the way up the Tigris I called on the Turkish officials at ’Amarah, Kut, and ’Aziziyah. The Resident’s annual tour on the Tigris was thus performed, and the flag shown, as usual. Baghdad was reached on the 19 th of January. 2. On the occasion of the Durbar the title of Nawab was conferred as a ^ personal distinction on Saiiad’Ali Khan * * See precedimr paragraph. x „ i -i i , , ,, of Baghdad, who was present there. Mr. Muhammad Hasan Muhsin, British Vice-Consul at Karbala, received the title of Khan Bahadur; and ’Abdul ’Ali Adamji, the pioneer of British Indian trade and enterprise at Baghdad, was made a Khan Sahib. These honours, the first of the kind that have been bestowed on British subjects in Mesopotamia, are profoundly appreciated by the recipients. A number of Durbar medals also have been awarded to European and Native British subjects in this country. 3. The Government of India have been pleased to raise the pay of the British Vice-Consul at Karbala from R200 to R300 a month w th elfect from the 30th October 1911. Mr. Muhammad Hasan, who is exceptionally well qualified for the post he holds, had done 8 years’ excellent service at Karbala without promotion; and this increase of pay, together with the decoration which he has now received, will assure him that his meritorious work in a remote and unattractive station has not passed unnoticed by Government. 4. With effect from May 1911, in consequence of a reorganisation of the Poreign Department of the Government of India, the Baghdad Residency became a Residency of the 2nd Class. It was formerly in the 3rd Class, which has now been abolished. 5. The assent of the Turkish authorities to the landing of the ammunition f .« . x o , brought by the new Residency Guard was t See last Summary VI, 1. , , j • i -ii . , , i not obtained without some delay, and it was only on the third visit of the steamer to Baghdad that the ammunition could be brought ashore and placed in the Residency. The incident attracted the notice of the local press. Two native papers have falsely alleged that relieving detachments always bring rifles and ammunition to Baghdad, while none are ever taken away; the inference intended to be drawn is that a large armoury and magazine are being formed in the British Residency for sinister purposes. One of the same papers dwells on a supposed progressive increase in the number of the Guard, which it says originally consisted of 12 men only. As a matter of fact, when the Residency Guard was instituted in September 1800, more than a century ago, it consisted of one Native Officer, 28 men and a drummer and fifer; its composition is now one Native Officer, 35 men and a bugler. Several men were added to the strength about 1904, when the new Residency, which requires three night sentries, was occupied; since then the only addition has been that of the bugler. The detachment have two or three non-military followers with them whose number fluctuates according to circumstances. As the ammunition sent on the present occasion was not really required^ and as it was despatched from India without previous notice to the Resident^ I have ventured to suggest a change of procedure to the Government of India with a view to avoiding the recurrence of difficulties.\80) /7« 11 The new Residency Guard are from the 7th Duke of Connaught’s Otfn Rajputs and are Hindus hy religion. This is the first time, so far as I can learn, that Hindu soldiers have been sent by Government to Baghdad, where there are no other Hindus and where the only religions known are the Muhammadan, the Jewish, and the Christian. There have been no untow~ard consequences, so far, of the innovation ; the men themselves seem quite happy and contented ; and they have had no friction w ith their surroundings. They have the finest appearance of any guard that has been stationed here in recent years, and it is probably well that Turks and Arabs have been given an opportunity of realising that the Indian Army consists only partially of Muhammadans. 6. The Government of India in a telegram dated 23rd January have sanctioned a scheme for the better management of the Oudh Bequest, of which under the will of the last King of Oudh they are the trustees. The proceeds of the Bequest, which now amount to about £8,000 a year, are under the King’s will to be paid in equal moieties to Mujtahids of Karbala and Is ajaf, who are to distribute the same to deserving persons for the benefit of the King’s soul. The money has been regularly paid to the Mujtahids; but very little of it, at least in recent times, has reached the deserving persons for whom it was intended. There has consequently been great dissatisfaction among Shi’ah Muhammadans generally ; and a strong feeling has been manifested that the British Government, as the trustees under the will, should take steps to ensure that the distributing Mujtahids do not embezzle the funds. The Government of India were of opinion that, before undertaking to intervene even indirectly in the distribution of the Bequest money, an effort should be made to induce the most renowned Mujtahids of the day at Karbala and Kajaf, who had both hitherto held aloof from the working of the Bequest, to associate themselves with it. This was accordingly done, but without success, and it then became necessary to resort to other methods of reform. The scheme sanctioned hy the Government of India contemplates the formation of a Charitable Committee at Karbala and of another at Najaf. Each Committee will consist of an equal number of Mujtahid distributors and other respectable persons nominated hy the Resident, Baghdad, and each will be presided over by the British Vice-Consul, Karbala. Every Mujtahid . Fixed for the present at one half. distributor will be required to distribute a j G L proportion * of the sum which he receives from the Bequest through the Committee of which he is a member; the other half he will he free to deal with according to his own ideas, and in most cases will probably reserve for himself as a “ deserving person.” These conditions' must be accepted in future by Mujtahid distributors prior to their appointment as such by the Resident. Whenever possible at least one of the Mujtahid distributors at Karbala and one at Najaf shall be elected from among Indian candidates. As soon as I have cleared off the arrears of work due to my absence in India I shall endeavour to visit Karbala and IS ajaf personally in order to give the new scheme a favourable start. 7. The arrangements for aiding Indian pilgrims in this country continue to expand and to work more satisfactorily. A pilgrim Agent has now been stationed at Basrah, where the pilgrims land, and where it is hoped he will be of much service to them in connection with the payment of quarantine fees, passport difficulties, the changing of their money, the transporting of their lu^age, and the engaging of passages for them on the river steamers. Most of the Indian Pilgrims are poor and ignorant people, speaking no language but their own, and easily fall a prey to the robbers who beset them on landing. The Agent will also be able to act as a translator to His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate at Basrah in Indian cases, and Mr. Crow has kindly expressed his willingness to make use of him and to give him necessary assistance. The stream of thanks which reaches me from returning pilgrims continues to grow in volume ; and the only complaints that I have received of insufficient assistance by an Agent refer to Musaiyih, where it was found necessary to engage the services of an Arab instead of a British subject. i J12 I Lave lately received from Lahore in the Panjab a letter of thanks bear ing numerous signatures, which contains a suggestion “ for the construction of Sarais at such sacred places as Kazimain, Samarra, Karbala, and Najaf Ashraf, just like those erected in the holy city of Ajmere in India, there being impera tive necessity for their construction in the interests of pilgrims.” The Chari table Committees at Karbala and Najaf will be able by and bye to consider whether under the terms of the King of Oudh’s will, a part of the funds from the Bequest might not be devoted to the provision “ of such resting places for the convenience of pilgrims.” In November, after my departure for India, Sartaj Jang, son of the Nazim-ul-Mulk of Haidarabad (Dakkan), in passing through Baghdad inter viewed Mr. Gaskin, the Commercial Assistant to the Besident. Mr. Gaskin noted: “ He said that one more measure was necessary to complete the comfort of the Indian pilgrims, and that was the establishment of Musafir- khanahs * at the holy places, especially at Kadhimain; and, if the Government of India would graciously take some interest in the matter, he would gladly subscribe ±15,000 towards the scheme and give an annual contribution of Itl,OoO during his lifetime towards defraying the recurring expenses. He al o said that on his return to India he would interest other Haidarabad nobles in the scheme, and he felt sure that the contributions would be sufficient to permit of the matter being carried to a successful issue.” Sartaj Jang, who will probably visit Baghdad again on his return from Karbala, further thought that the money collected should be sent through the Besident at Haidarabad to the Besident at Baghdad ; and he suggested finally, that the Musahrkhanah should be erected “ as a Coronation memorial of His Majesty King George V ” and should be named after His Majesty. It is understood that the mother of His Highness the Agha Khan of Bombay left a large plot of land at Kadhimain for the erection of a pilgrim’s hostel, and that some years ago His Highness the Agha Khan himself sent some B20,000 to a local agent to erect a building on it, but that the money has mostly been misappropriated by the agent. I visited the place a few days ago and found that nothing had been done beyond building a wall round it, which certainly did not cost B20,00J. It was probably this well-known instance of fraud which led Sartaj Jang to suggest that the assistance of the British Besi- dents at Haidarabad and Baghdad should be sought in connection with his own scheme. I have written to the Agha Khan, who is personally known to me, enquiring whether he would like the state of his benefaction at Kadhimain to be examined on his behalf, and whether he thinks of going on with the matter. The awakening interest of intelligent Indians in the conditions under which the Shi’ah pilgrimages are made here is an encouraging symptom. 8. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has been pleased to approve of the grant of certificates of nationality gratis to indigent Indian British subjects in the Baghdad Wiiayat, subject to the condition that applicants in Jormd pauperis shall first prove to the satisfaction of the issuing Consular authority their inability to pay the customary fee. It is to be expected that this arrangement will greatly facilitate the compilation of a proper register of the British subjects resident in Baghdad and its dependencies. I am now arranging for the division of the towns in which there are many Indians into wards, in each of which I intend to appoint an Indian Lambardar or headman who will be the medium of communication between this Besidency and the Indians living in his ward. The headman will be expected to see that all Indians register themselves, to report to the Besident all births and deaths in the Indian community, the arrival of new Indians, the departure of others, and all matters affecting Indians, such as crimes committed by or against them, demands made on them by the Turkish authorities, etc. Experience has shown that it is impossible to maintain proper supervision over and touch with the Indian immigrants, who are very numerous, without some system of the sort contemplated. The Qawwasses of this Besidency and of the Karbala Vice- Consulate are too few for the work, moreover none of them are themselves Indians and with few exceptions they are ignorant of Hindustani.P 1 13 VII.

I have compared notes with the local manager of the Euphrates and l igris Steam ^Navigation Company and find that our impressions in regard to the intentions of the Germans about the transport of their railway material coincide generally. One thing is clear, that with some 300,000 tons of railway material to be brought to Baghdad by the Tigris in the next five years or so, the carrying capacities^ of the steamship companies plying on the river will have to be doubled, if ordinary trade is to continue even in the same lame fashion as at present.

In an interview with me the redoubtable Dr. Endrucks, who is a young and very pushing man, seemed to admit that he favoured an arrangement with the Idarah Nahriyah exclusively; but he earnestly disclaimed the Anglophobe sentiments which he says have been imputed to him in Europe, and he seemed anxious that we should be on good terms. Air. Tod’s own scheme, as I understand it, is the creation of a special fleet for railway transport work in which his own firm, the Idarah Nahriyah, and the Hail way Company would all be interested, the ordinary vessels and business of Messrs. Lynch and the Idarah N ahriyah remaining distinct as at present. He remarks that the experience and success of Messrs. Lynch in commercial navigation on the Tigris entitle them, ceteris paribus, to a privileged position in the combine. His scheme seems a workable one, provided acceptable con ditions can be arranged among the parties. 219G F. D.14 3.

It would not be wonderful if the attack were an attempt on the part of Abul Qasirn himself to make a little political capital out of a fortuitous circumstance. 5. In the Misbah-al-Agharr, a Baghdad newspaper, of the 18th January an article appeared signed by Saiyid Muhi-ud-Din (Gilani), apparently a son so named of the Naqib of Baghdad.

Baghdad in a special steamer, which he was to be allowed to utilise for general downward cargo, has broken down ; but Mr. Tod has now obtained a more valuable concession through his friend Sevian Bey. It has been settled that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company shall be allowed to put an extra tug on the Tigris with Dvo barges, one of which will carry cargo for the Idarah xNahriyah and the other for Messrs. Lynch. Towards the end of January a strike of all the deck hands occurred on one of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s steamers. The object was an increase of pay which had been expected, if not promised, for some time, but whicti there was delay in granting. Mr. Tod acted with his usual decision in dismissing 22 men, after which he increased the pay but refused to reinstate the strikers. This put an end to the trouble, which extended to all the Company’s ships, and to stokers as well as deck hands. There have been many breakages and shortages of late in the cargo carried by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, but it is not ascertained yet whether that Company is to blame or the British India Steam Navigation Company, in whose ships most of the merchandise coming by sea to Basrah is brought. A consignment of Government stores for the R.I.M.S. “Comet” was received short, and out of a £100 worth of private stores which had been sent to me from home about a third is missing. Some allowance must be made for the difficulties under which the river steamers work owing to congestion of cargo at Basrah and to the hasty loading and unloading necessitated by the smallness of their number. 2. One or two small stern-wheelers belonging to the Turkish subject Agha Ja’far appear to be now running regularly on the Tigris.15 The following notice, signed by the Assistant Wali of Baghdad on behalf of the Wali, was published in the Nawadir newspaper at Baghdad on the 10th January : — “ The right to navigate the Tigris and Euphrates is granted to Turkish subjects only ; it is not enjoyed by any foreigners except Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co., who have three steamers plying under certain conditions. “ It is understood that some sailing vessels belonging to Persians are running on both rivers; hut as the prohibition {sc. of foreign vessels) includes all steamers and sailing vessels, no (foreign) steamer or sailing vessel will be allowed to enter the said rivers from the date of this notice. t£ As regards steamers or sailing vessels which may have entered before this date, a period of three months from this date is allowed them to finish their operations and leave. “ Any steamer which may hereafter enter from the Persian Gulf and any steamer or sailing vessel which is already on the Tigris or Euphrates and fails to leave within the three months will be confiscated.” It does not appear that the notice is aimed at, or will affect, any British interest. 3. Messrs. Blockey, Cree &amp; Co., the British firm of mechanical engineers at Baghdad, appear to have a most flourishing business. Their sale of oil engines and centrifugal pumps for agricultural purposes is always increasing. There will soon he 200 engines imported by them at work in the country of 1,500 total horse power, between 600 and 70o of which represent the engines imported during the last year alone. Mr. Cree informs me that Messrs. &amp; Hornsby &amp; Sons, whose agents his firm are, cannot always supply the engines as fast as they are ordered. Messrs. Blockey Cree &amp; Co.’s cinematograph continues to be well natronised: it is the only evening entertainment at Baghdad. The firm have lately been appointed the local agents of the General Electric Company, Limited Besides this Company and Messrs. Hornsby they now represent the BovalInsurance Company (Eire and Life), the Mannheim Insurance Company (Marine) Gwynnes, Limited (Pumps), the Pulsometer Engineering Company, Limited (Ice making machines), the Gandy Belt Manufacturing Company, Limited (Belting), the Burma Oil Company, Limited (Candles), Messrs. E It and E Turner, Limited (Flour machines), and Messrs. John J. Thorny- croft &amp; Co., Limited (Motor Boats and Engines). They also contemplate laro-e additions to the plant of their own workshop. ° 4 rpp e position of the Baghdad Municipal Loan is probably better known at Constantinople than here, but I have reason to think that the present Wali considers that £T. 200,000 would be an excessive amount for the Munici- mlitv of Baghdad to borrow, and that £T. 40,000 would be a more suitable amount In my opinion he is perfectly right. The larger sum could not be Tent to advantage here, and to meet the interest and sinking fund charges Tit it would he necessary to double, or nearly to double, the present municipal taxation—obviously a measure too stringent to be recommended. 5 The Municipality of Najaf have long been toying with the project of a water supply to be pumped from the Euphrates, 6 miles distant, and the idea Sms at last not unlikely to take ^ definite shape Messrs. Blockey Cree &amp; Co are not inclined to undertake the scheme by themselves; but I kfaro that Sir John Jackson, Limited, are making surveys and looking into the learn tnai eventually obtain a contract for the work they will Ztabiy order the mathi/ery require! through Messrs. Blockey Cree &amp; Co. 6 The provision of a great iron bridge across the river at Baghdad, which has often been discussed, seems to have been relegated to the distant future, and ke talk now is of replacing the present bridge of wooden pontoons by two or more of iron pontoons. In the opinion of persons well qualified to judge this would be a mistake, for iron pontoons cannot be neglected and the Turks wouldalmost certainly omit the necessary repainting at regular intervals. But two or even three bridges of wooden pontoons, similar to but better maintained than the present very serviceable bridge, would make a different place of Baghdad, and would enable the town to spread down the “further” (i.e., the western) bank of the river, so relieving its overcrowded condition. 7. The Government of India lately requested my opinion by telegram concerning a proposal on the part of the Eastern Bank, Limited, to open a branch at Baghdad. 1 replied that I had good reason' to suppose that the (British) National Bank of Turkey contemplated starting business here shortly and that they ought to have a preference, their raison d'etre being, I believed, to push British commercial enterprise throughout Turkey, while I thought that they were also closely associated with Sir J. Jackson, Limited, the Irrigation work contractors. I recommended therefore that no encouragement should be given the Eastern Bank to come to Baghdad otherwise than by arrangement with the National Bank, unless, of course, the latter should fail to carry out their present intentions. 8. The Wali lately told me that he was urging Messrs. John Eowler to send agricultural machinery to Baghdad. I gathered that he had advised them to supply heavy and costly apparatus, for which the day has certainly not yet arrived here, though it may come. But the question of agricultural machinery in this country is a large and important one, and attention was drawn to it in the Trade Beport of the Baghdad Consulate*General for 1909. The Germans too are giving it their attention. Meissner Pasha, who is nothing if not frank, gave me to understand lately that the Baghdad Bailway Company intended to sell agricultural machinery at cheap rates —if not actually to give it away at first—in order to stimulate the growing of grain for export by their line. It might be worth the while of a strong British firm, I think, to send an expert out to study the nature of the ground and crops and the type of machinery required. Nothing can be done with advantage in London, working merely upon Consular reports; and the British firms at Baghdad, capable as they are in their own lines, have no specialists in agricultural machinery. If an agent were sent out from England at once he would arrive in time for the grain harvest, which in the open plains about Kirkuk and Arbil begins to be reaped in April. There, I think, reaping machines and even steam ploughs might find some sale at once ; and a firm which has established its reputation anywhere in the country would be in a favourable position to compete when the great deserts between the Euphrates and the Tigris are thrown open to the cultivation of -wheat and barley by irrigation from the Hindiyah Barrage and other works. On my late tour in India I found that agricultural machinery was at last being bought in considerable quantities by native cultivators in the Chenab Colony in the Punjab; and I imagine that the firms which supply the Indian market— I cannot state from memory which they are - would be the best to advise with on the subject of Baghdad. A firm sending out an agent should have no difficulty in coming to an arrangement with a local British firm such as Messrs. Stephen Lynch &amp; Co. or Messrs Blockey Cree &amp; Co. The travelling agent should bring out with him suitable machinery for exhibition and experiment; but special arrangements would be necessary to ensure its arrival in time for next harvest, as ordinary cargo now takes a long time in transit between the United Kingdom and Baghdad. The Baghdad Wilayat -would, I have every reason to think, show an interest in the matter, provided the present Wali had not been transferred elsewhere in the meantime. IX.— General and Miscellaneous. 1. The future of the Middle East is a riddle as yet unread; but the extension of one European Power across Persia and of another across Turkish Arabia to the Persian Gulf is an admitted possibility. It may not be within our ability to prevent the advance of either Power without imposing an in tolerable strain upon our already overburdened military resources. If the two Powers should act in concert our difficulties would be so much the greater. In my recent voyage down the Persian Gulf to India I could not but look attentively at the frowning sea-girt promontories of Kuus-al-Jibal, the17 salient of the Arabian coast which all but closes the entrance of the Gulf. I had already made a closer acquaintance with them in 1903, on the occasion of Lord Curzon’s cruise in the Persian Gulf. Here in Puus-al-Jibal are the best, indeed the only good, harbours in the lower Gulf ; and the precipitous mountain mass containing them is one huge natural fortress, unexposed to attack except by sea or across the desert. I could not but ask myself whether the possession of this headland, especially in combination with the islands on the Persian side (Qishm, Hanjam, Hormuz and Larak), might not afford an almost absolute guarantee for the security of the British Empire in India against untoward developments in the f ^The strategical importance of Ruus-al-Jibal was clearly recognised a few years ago : witness the official papers * of the time and the British flagstaffs which were erected at certain points there interior of the Persian Gulf. * For a short account of the discussions then held, see ‘‘Summary of the Principal Events and Measures of the Vice- royaltv of H. E. Lord Curzon of Kedleston,” Part I, Chapter IV. The Persian Gulf, pages 46 —47, by the present writer. J. G. L. in 1904 and removed afterwards for political reasons. I do not urge that a position should immediately be taken up in Ruus-al- Jibal or a new Gibraltar created there, but only that reasonable preparations should be made, if possible, for such a measure, in case events move adversely for us. No garrison would be located in such a trying climate unless and until necessity arose. But a free port might be founded, according to the late Sir Lewis Pelly’s attractive scheme of 50 years ago, which would become an entrepbt of commerce for the whole Gulf ; and this would fit in well with later projects which have been, or still are, under discussion for the lighting of the mouth of the Gulf and establishing of wireless telegraphic communications in the Gulf region under British auspices. What is the chief obstacle in the way of the preparations recommended ? , „ , ,, ... , It is the Ansdo-French f Joint f “ The French authorities, who evidently hoped to be able to retain Bandar Jissah by means of suitable guarantees as to the nature of the French occupation, at first demurred to the view maintained by the Brit sh Foreign Office, that the Dec'aration of 1862 precluded the acceptance by either France m Britain of a cession or lease of ’Oman .erritory; eventually however they accepted the British reading of the treaty.” I'raft of Volume I, of the Persian Gulf Gazetteer by the present writer. Chapter II, under head “Settlement of the French coaling station question, 1900.” J. G. L. re- Declaration of 1862 with ference to the integrity of the dominions of the Sultan of Masqat, to whom the Ruus-al- Jibal promontory belongs. Now if popular impressions are not far astray, Great Britain has recently laid France under heavy obligations by support rendered in a difficult crisis. Might France not be approached with a view to the setting aside of the Declaration of 1862 and, if the result were favourable, might a quiet cession of the Ruus-al-Jibal promontory by the Sultan of Masqat to Great Britain not be obtained ? I do not pretend to any knowledge of strategy or tactics, but I venture to claim that five years’ employment on the Persian Gulf Gazetteer and an intimate acquaintance with the political, naval, and military history of the Gull- down to 1907, to which may be added more than two years’ service since at Baghdad—the remotest political outpost in this direction of the Indian Empire, entitle me to make tentative suggestions on a subject which has already been discussed by experts in its strategical and tactical bearings. I should welcome an opportunity of dealing with any difficulties or objections, connected with local politics, which can be advanced. 2. The winter has been an unusually mild one at Baghdad, just as last summer was exceptional in its coolness. In January 1912 the average minimum temperature was 39° Fahrenheit as against 33° in January 1911; and the lowest actual minimum was 32° as against 25°. J. G.

Under date November 28th, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Aleppo * See last Summary i, i. writes that Sa’dun * Pasha of thej Muntafik died there on the 25th Novem- j her. Ihe Wali of Aleppo informed the Consul that the Pasha’s death was due to “ apoplexy and heart failure.” 2. The Wali of Basrah, Hasan Rizaf Bey, arrived at Baghdad on the 4th December. He informed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah that the object of his visit was to see something of the country and to renew his friendship with the Wali of Baghdad.J During his absence the Defterdar, Husni Bey, was in charge of the Basrah Wilayat. At Baghdad it was rumoured that His Excellency had come in connection with recent affairs at Muhammarah § and to arrange w r ith the Baghdad Wali and the Commander of the 13th Army Corps for \ the strengthenino: of the garrison at + He has, I learn, been granted the rank of Siwa before leaving Constantinople. He has been trained as an artillery officer in Germany and is considered to be the best artillery officer the Turks possess. J No doubt, however, the Wali of Baghdad ordered him to come here as he has power to do so under his firman of appointment. § See last Summary I, 6. Basrah. His Excellency remained at Baghdad till the 14th December. It is said that during his stay here he had consultations with the Wali of Baghdad for the improvement of the Nahriyah Administration, and with the Comman- der-in-Chief about the state of the Muntafic. His Excellency was at Amarah on the 22nd December. 3 His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Musal reports that a new “ Nahie ” has been established at Hammam ’Ali on the Tigris about 20 miles below Musal and that a Mudir and some Gendarmes have been sent there. 4. The same officer also reports that— (a) Saiyid ’Ali, Qaim-Maqam of Shehrbazar (N. of Sulaimaniyah) has been dismissed for incompetence, and Hasan ’Askari, ex-Qaim- Maqam of Akhra, has been appointed acting Qaim-Maqam. (5) Saiyid Ahmad Baba Bussool of Sulaimaniyah has been appointed “ Idari Me’mouri ” of Serdesht. Up till now this post, like most of these frontier posts, has been held by military officers. This looks like a step towards the establishment of regular Qaim- Maqams in the newly acquired districts. (c) Two chiefs of the Dizdi Kurds, w r ho have been 10 months in prison at Musal, have been sent to Kirkuk for trial. (d) On the 14th December the Isnan tribe in the neighbourhood of Tel Afar carried off 500 sheep belonging to Musal merchants. The latter have petitioned the Wali, but so far nothing has been done. (e) On 1st December three Gendarmes who were escorting the post to Gulambar (S. E. of Sulaimaniyah) were attacked by Kurds. One Gendarme was killed and two wounded. (/) On November 25th a caravan coming from Aleppo was attacked at Abu Hamda, between Ain el Chazal and El Bida, and robbed of £T. 250 worth of merchandise. The robbers are said to have been Turkomans. 5. Tahir Pasha, the Wali of Musal, left his headquarters on 30th November on tour. It was reported that he was going to inspect the Zab bridge and the 1834 F. D. b, 17 FEB 19121k DFn2 Kirkuk irrigation works, and thence to Sulaimaniyah. It was said that some serious dispute had arisen at Kirkuk and that the chief object of his tour was to settle this. He Tvas accompanied by the notorious Sabortji Pasha who has great influence at Kirkuk. Others again said that His Excellency was proceeding to the frontier to induce the Kurds there to accept Turkish nationality and not to go over to the Persian side of the frontier, and colour was given to this theory as Sabonji Pasha’s influence among the Kurds is said to be great. The Wali* however, returned to Musal on the 11th December having proceeded as far as Kirkuk only where he found the irrigation works at a standstill. His Excellency’s departure on tour before the Bairam Eed caused some indignation among' the military who had arranged to have a race-meeting on the third day of the Eed in aid of the Turkish Navy. The Wall’s departure before that event showed he was not in sympathy with its object, and the military think that many of the local notables who would have been practically bound to attend the meeting had the Wali been present absented themselves. 6. The following units composing ’Askari Bey’s column, which left Bagh dad last September* for Karbala, etc., returned to Baghdad on the 16th December:— •See Summary for October 1911, I, 3. 120 Cavalry, 16 Artillery, 70 Infantry. 7. As an example of the freedom of the locnl press the following open letter c d ’rested to the Wali ofjBag'idad by the editor of the ' Rasafa ” on the 29th December is interesting :— “ You are not liked either by the inhabitants of the town or by the majority of the officials. Although you are hardworking you employ your efforts and time on things which are neither essential nor useful, while urgent work is neglected Please do not think that my remarks are based on personal interest. I write merely for the purpose of telling you the truth. You are surrounded by men who mislead you and make your efforts fruitless.” 8. One Saiyid Jewad, a Killadar (key-keeper) of the Shrine at Najaf, has published a letter in which he informs the Wali of Baghdad that the Qaim- Maqam of Najaf had demanded of him the sum of £T. 2,000 to open a High School, and had threatened him, in the event of his refusing, with great Joss The Saiyid declined to acquiesce and he now complains that the Qaim-Maqam is causing him trouble in connection with his landed pro 2 )erties. The Killadar appeals to the Wali to protect his rights. II.— Tukkish Affairs. (a) Military. 1. I have received the following information from His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal: — (a) Essad Pasha, Commandant of the Musal Army Corps, returned on November 22nd from a tour of inspection in the Sulaimaniyah and Ruwanduz districts. His return was earlier than was expected and is attributed to recent Russian military movements in Persia. (b) On the 17th November Eerid Bey, a Qaim-Maqam of the General Staff, arrived to inspect the cavalry. He has since left for Baghdad by raft. (c) Eattah Bey has arrived as Commandant of the Radif Division : up till now Abdurrahman Pasha has been acting in this capacity. The latter will shortly proceed to Kirkuk to command the 34th and 35th Cavalry Regiments there.3 (d) On 27th November Emin Bey, Inspector of Artillery, came to Musal: the artillery went out into the desert and did target practice before him. He had previously been to Baghdad, Kirkuk, Sulaimaniyah, Passwa, Nagirde and Buwanduz. (e) There has been great military activity at Musal lately. The soldiers are drilled more than before. Twice a week the officers are called together and a problem in tactics is set before them, their answer to which they bring on the next occasion. (/) £. T. 3,000 has been sent to Baghdad for winter clothing for the garrison : the clothing has not yet arrived and there is much discontent as the weather has begun to be chilly. (g) Since the 11th November, 361 Christians and 451 Muhammadan recruits have arrived at Musal from Anatolia: of these 492 have been sent to Baghdad : 200 to Kirkuk and 120 to Keui Sandjak. The majority of those sent to the frontier districts are Christians and there is said to have been great discontent among them at being sent to a district where “ there are no Christians, no priests, and they are sure to be killed.” (A) On the 7th December 26 Moslem and 114 Christian recruits arrived from Anatolia, and on the 13th December 21 Moslem and 29 Christ an recruits from Diarbekir. On the 7th December 2 Jews and 70 Christians were sent to Keui Sandjak : and on the same date 4.000 very old pattern rifles and 2,000 bayonets were despatched to Baghdad. On the 19th December 7,200 rifles, escorted by 80 cavalry, reached Musal from Baghdad. These are said to be of the usual type holding 10 cartridges in a tube the length of the barrel. They are destined for the Radif and the Ihtiyat. 2 Alatthews, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul at Basrah, reports that on the 27th November the 38th Nishanji Regiment was transferred from Maiah on the lower Euphrates, to Basrah town, and that it was reported that several other battalions would be withdrawn from the lower Euphrates and concentrated at Basrah. The landing of British troops in the Gulf is the local explanation of this measuie. 3 On the 13th December it was reported that the Minister for War had sent orders to the Commandant ot the 13th Army Corps to form, at Govern ment expense, extra companies of volunteers under the name of I n Boulukleri ” (Frontier Companies). People are said to he going to the feerai and enrolling themselves as Volunteers. 4. Under date 22nd December, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah reports as follows :— “ I am informed that the military authorities here have received orders to strengthen all military posts near Basrah, especially the lao gairison. Lately 200 recruits were sent from Baghdad, of whom 50 landed at Amarah and the remaining 150 proceeded to Basrah on the 16th instant: 800 men o the ‘ Cadro Boluki ’ also arrived from Baghdad the same week. The i battalion of the 112th Eegiment now consisj/of 350 men, Mine of ^hom ^e posted at Zubeir, Sefwan Urn and BuW island C&amp;KSf nttrt* ^ The 30th Nishanji Kegiment now consists of 350 men, so the total strength of the mfent^ force at and near Basrah now numbers 930 men. It is stated that moie (b) Civil. 6. The pupils of the Law to the central authorities that Law in their school. School at Baghdad are reported to have complained the Wali is attempting to suppress the study of4 TI 6. Saiyid Kiamil Effendi and Muhammad Nadim Effendi, editors of the “ Baynumnahrayn ” and some others have telegraphed to the Constantinople newspapers “ Tanin,” “ Iqdam,*’ “ Sabah ” and “ Tanzimat ” that the Wali of Baghdad received a sum of £ T. 12,000 as a bribe on his recent tour in the Shamiyah. 7. The Baghdad newspapers have lately been writing in very strong terms against the Committee of Union and Progress. They express the opinion that its existence is injurious to the best interests of Turkey. 8. A report is current the Ministry for Public Works has authorised the Wali to construct the following iron bridges :—on the Tigris at Baghdad, Muaddhdham and Qarrara : on the Euphrates at Musaiyib and Ealluja ; and on the Diayala at Bakuba. The necessary funds will be supplied by the Ministry of Public Works. 9. On the 14th December public criers warned the inhabitants that the circulation of foreign currency has been prohibited. The newspapers as well as the inhabitants object to this prohibition as it is a well-known fact that there is not a sufficiency of Turkish small coin for the requirements of the country. 10. The accelerated Turkish postal service to Constantinople * vid Aleppo „ , 0 TT „ and Beyrouth, has apparently not met * See last Summary II, 11. i. 1 ^ with the success that was anticipated, for the Turkish post office at Baghdad is now offering merchants a discount of 20 per cent, on the sale of their stamps. This is evidently an inducement to get the commercial firms at Baghdad to transfer their correspondence from the British Indian post office to the Turkish office. (c) Political. 11. Some time ago the Baghdad Government is said to have suggested to the central authorities at Constantinople that with the object of bringing Shiahs and Sunnis together a talented preacher should be sent to Karbala. The idea appears to have been approved and a man is now said to be preaching Pan-Islamism to the Shiahs and Sunnis. He preaches at the Clubs and at the houses of the notables, but up to the present it has apparently not met with much success : nor have I received any information about it from the British Vice-Consul at Karbala. 12. All excitement over the war between Italy and Turkey has died down completely. All eyes are now focussed on events in Persia. 13. A rumour is current that when the war between Italy has been brought to a close, the Arabs intend to protest against the maladministration of Turkish officials and statesmen, and that they propose to form an Arab Khalifate and establish an Arabian dynasty. 14. At Kadhimain a Saiyid Salah Hulli has been trying to foment excite ment among the people by means of public speeches against England and Russia The Qaim-Maqam has warned him to desist. 15. The editor of the “ Baynumnahrayn ” in its issue of the 25th December blames the Wali of Baghdad for supporting the Qaim-Maqam of Najaf. This, the papei^say§(is because the Qaim-Maqam is a member of the Committee of Union and Progress. The editor ends by warning the Wali that his action will only make him less popular with the people of Baghdad. 16. Under date 22nd December, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah reports as follows :— “ An evidently inspired article in the 1 Reshad ’ dated 1st—14th Decem ber draws the attention of the authorities to the urgent necessity of fortifying Eao as the vital spot in all ‘ Iraq and Mesopotamia ’ and dwells on the importance oTTceeping new guns, trained soldiers of the line and provisions there, ‘ for we are all in the lion’s claws, i.e., those of all the West and shall become its prey’.”III. -Persian Affairs. 1. The British Vice-Consul at Karbala writing under date 30th November \ reports that this year’s pilgrim season has been remarkable for the inrush of fugitives from Kirmanshah. He estimates them to be over 4,000, including Princes, Khans, merchants and others. The Ehtisham-ud-Daulah, late Governor of Kirmanshah, is one of them The Vice-Consul reports an interview with the Prince in the following words : — “ During a recent meeting with him, the Prince confidentially told me of a secret conversation which the Prince Salar-ud-Daulah had with him in Kirmanshah about the instructions which Muhammad ’Ali and himself had received from Russia prior to their return to regain authority. He said their release was allowed on two conditions : (1&gt; that in case of regaining the throne the civil and military administration of the country should be placed under Pussian discretion and nothing in which she does not concur is to be done by them ; (2) that in case of their failure they should use their power to upset the country and create additional chaos by which Russia may get an oppor tunity for intervention.” From the Vice-Consul’s report it would appear that Ehtisham-ud-Daulah was averse to Salar-ud-Daulah taking any action until it was apparent that Muhammad ’Ali’s attempt to regain the throne appeared successful. The Salar- ud-Daulah was, however, bent on plunging the country in civil war. The Prince still expects further outbreaks and lie is reported to have said that if such is the case, to protect his own interests, he and some ^,0 '0 refugees from Kirman shah intend to proceed to Baghdad and to apply to the Wali for letters of naturalisation as Turkish subjects. He .stated that similar apphcations would be made by his countrymen to the foreign Consulates in Persia. He is reported to have discussed these and other questions with Mulla Kazim, Khorasani, who in reply regretted the present state of affairs in Persia, and added that by his (the Prince’s) backing the Constitution he had meant well for the country and the nation, but that Providence had destined it otherwise. 2. In the latter end of November great excitement was caused at Najaf \ when it becnme known that the Mujtahid Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi, who for many years had consistently declined to identify himself with political matters, had at last signed a Fatva for Jehad against the Italian attack on Tripoli and the Russian and British “invasion” of Persia. Copies of the “ Fetwa ” were hung on the walls of the shrine and liberally distributed among the people. Numerous copies were des- * see Annexure a. patched to Persia and the Caucasus. A translation of this document * is attached. Two versions are given by the Vice-Consul as to how this Mujtahid had been persuaded (1) that the Qaim-Maqam of Najaf personally called on the Mujtahid and was closetted with him for about five hours before he could induce him to sign the document. (2) The other version is that the Qaim- Maqam called on the Mujtahid accompanied by Gendarmes. Six people assisted at the interview, viz. : Saiyid Muhammad Kazim and his two sons, the Qaim-Maqam, and Shaikh ’Ali Shaikh Riza and his son Shaikh Ahmad. The Qaim-Maqam then produced the “ Fatva ” already drawn up for his signature. Saiyid Muhammad Kazim refused saying he was only a darwish and not interested in politics In the end the Qaim-Maqam producing a revolver threatened to shoot him and then shoot himself. Saiyid Kazim’s sons then prevailed on him to sign the “ Fatva.” One Husain Sarraf ran to the market place and summoned the people to witness the presence of the Qaim-Maqam in Saiyid Kazim’s house. The latter version is generally accepted at Baghdad as correct. 3. The Qaim-Maqam of Najaf is said to be a prominent member of the Central Committee of Union and Progress, and besides holding his present post as Qaim-Maqam is also an Inspector of Wilayat and as such is authorised, in \ urgent cases, to correspond direct with the Minister for the Interior. He is j consequently a man of some importance and it is said that the M ali and other minor officials keep on excellent terms with him for fear of his reporting them unfavourably to Constantinople.6 The Qaim-Maqam was ordered by the Wali to come to Baghdad. A secret enquiry was held as to his conduct. It is rumoured as a consequence that he will be transferred from Najaf. During the Qaim-Maqam’s absence at Baghdad Saiyid Kazim issued a second Fetva * (translation enclosed) in which only Italy and Russia are men tioned as the enemies of Islam. This second document was issued ostensibly as an attempt to exonerate the Qaim-Maqam from having forced him to issue the first Fetva. I informed His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador by telegram of these events. 4 The Zuhur published a telegram of the Agence Ottoman saying “ we congratulate ail Moslems on the appearance of Saiyid Kazim’s Fetva which has been wrested from him, thanks to the efforts of the Qaim-Maqam.” 5. While the excitment caused by the publication of the first document was still at its height, the Mullahs of Najaf proposed to hold a conference there to discuss what steps should he taken by them for the expulsion of the British and Russian troops in Persia. They wrote to Mirza Hasan Nainee of Kadhimain to wire to Mirza Muhammad Taqi, Shirazi, of Samarrah to proceed to Najaf for the Ghadur pilgrimage during which period the conference was to be held. Mirza Muhammad Taqi declined the invitation on the score of age, but to Mirza Hasan Nainee he is said to have written that if it were the intention of the ISajaf Mujtahids to declare Jehad against Russia and England they were committing a serious blunder and encompassing the ruin of the poor and helpless Shiahs of Persia. About the 4th December Saiyid Ismail Saddr-ud-Din and Shaikh Hmain, Mazandarani, went to Najaf for the Ghadur pilgrimage and to attend the conference. A preliminary meeting was held at the Toosi Mosque at Najaf at which some of the leading Mujtahids were present. One Mullah Muhsin is said to have delivered a stirring speech on the present plight of Persia. It was un animously resolved that until they had arrived at a definite plan of action the Mujtahids should suspend giving lessons and cea^e saying the daily prayer. This was evidently done to excite public feeling, and Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi, was the only Mujtahid who vetoed it and continued saying prayers publicly at the shrine as usual. It appears that Ismail Saddr-ud-Din and some of the other Mujtahids induced some of the students to expostulate with Saiyid Kazim, Yezdi, on his singular behaviour, and the reply they received was that the suspension of public prayers was not likely to frighten the Russians. The students then tried to forcibly stop him from praying publicly and went so far as to remove his prayer carpet from him while he was praying. Their action appears to have caused a serious riot. Saiyid Muhammad Kazim had to take refuge in the sanctuary of the shrine from whence he was rescued by the Qaim-Maqam who came to his assistance with some zaptiehs. A number of the rioters in the shrine were also arrested. The excitement continued throughout the night and bands of armed Arabs patrolled the streets ready to attack all Persian students. The Qaim-Maqam ordered soldiers and zaptiehs to be stationed at the principal entrances to the shrine with orders to flog all students belonging to the party of Mullah Kazim, Khorasani, and his colleagues. The soldiers and zaptiehs are said to have used the butt-end of their rifles freely and to have soon dispersed the mob for that night. The excitement, however, did not subside for some days, the students continuing to parade the streets with banners and calling upon the Mujtahids to proclaim a Jehad. Up to about the 16th December public prayers had been suspended by all the Mujtahids except Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi, and Shaikh ’Ali Rufaish, a Turkish subject. On the 9th December an unanimous order for Jehad signed by all the Mujtahids (except Saiyid Mahammad Kazim, Yezdi) was handed to the students to be read publicly at the shrines. It was also printed for circulation and efforts were made to publish it as widely as possible, telegrams being sent to the Mujtahids in the principal towns of Persia requesting them to prepare for ageneral rising. Saiyid Ismail Saddr-ud-Din was deputed to interview Saiyid ! Muhammad Kazim, and induce him to join. Some say that he absolutely refused to have anything to do with them, while others say that he acquiesced on the condition that he would follow them when* they had reached Khanaqin or Kasr-i-Shirin. On the 10th December Saiyid Ismail Saddr-ud-Din was to have addressed a public meeting in the courtyard of the shrine. He was, however, prevented - by the local authorities who said that they had received orders to prohibit all political meetings and that the Persians should therefore cease creating trouble in Turkish territory. This put a stop to public demonstrations, but the agitation for Jehad was as strong as ever. Three students of Najaf divorced their wives and left for Karbala with the object of stirring the people there and awaiting the arrival of the Mujtahids who were supposed to be ready to proceed to Persia. The arrival of the three students at Karbala was the signal for demonstrations there. The Liberals gathered at the houses of Saiyid Muhammad Baqir, Mirza ’Ali Sharistani, and Hasan Khan Madrasah clamouring for Jehad and that the Karbala Mujtahids should also join. Mulla Kazim, Khorasani, was expected to reach Karbala, en route to Persia, on the 13th December, and on that day news was received at Karbala of the sudden death of the Mulla. The news fell like a thunderbolt on the Persians, all hope of a Jehad was now shattered. S/me thought that the Mulla had been poisoned at the instigation of the Qaim-Maqam, who since his return from Baghdad appears to have gone over to the side of Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi, and to have described Mulla Kazim, Khorasani, and his followers as seditioners. Some were of opinion that Amir Afkham, ex-Governor of Hamadan, had had a hand in it, while others again accused Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi. Subsequently it was learnt from the Mulla’s own followers, that he had been suddenly seized with a stomach-ache on the day previous to his j death : that he had refused to take the medicine prescribed him by his hakim, | and that he had suddenly died on the following morning. On the 13th December the Tabour Aghasi of Karbala was ordered by the Wall of Baghdad to proceed to Najaf to enquire into the cause of the Mulla’s death as well as to arrange for the protection of Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi. News was subsequently received at Karbala that the people of Najaf had raided the house of Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi, and had threatened that if he refused to head the movement his life would be in danger. The mob were, how'ever, driven away by the police. Saiyid Ismail Saddr-ud-Din, who had returned to Karbala from Najaf on the 12th December, was telegraphed from Najaf to proceed thither to lead the movement, but he was not at all inclined to accept that onerous position. Tailing Saddr-ud-Din, the Constitutionalists look to Sheriat Ispahani leading them, but he is said to lack influence. On the 23rd December the Vice-Consul at Karbala wrote to say that before the death of Mulla Kazim the Wali of Baghdad had written to him (MulJa Kazim) as well as to Saiyid Muhammad Kazim, Yezdi, and Shaikh ’Abdullah, Mazandarani, informing them that it was not permissible for them to hold public meetings in Turkish territory advocating a Jehad. They were also * informed that if they wished to proceed to Persia tliey should not proceed thither in a body nor should they carry arms, as if on a warlike expedition. The death j of Mulla Kazim has put an end, at all events for the present, to a Mujtahid j invasion of Persia. 6. The next event of importance at Najaf was the sudden arrest of the Amir Afkham, his two sons, and one Saiyid Akbar Shah. They were brought under custody to Karbala where they were allowed to halt for two days under surveillance and then sent on to Baghdad. Saiyid Akbar Shah is said to be a notorious Royalist, while the Amir Afkham and his two sons are accused of rendering material assistance to Salar-ud-Daulah’s forces when they marched against Hamadan and Tehran. They were sent under escort from Baghdad on the 28th December. It is not known whether their ultimate destination will be Damascus or Constantinople.8 7. The “ Najaf ” newspaper of the 15th December pul)lishes the following letter (1) from the Russian Consul-General at Baghdad to his Consular Agent at Najaf, and (2) a reply to it by the son of Mulla Kazim, Khorasani :— (1) “ Some mischief-makers tried to mislead the Mujtahids to instigate the Persians against Rus&gt;ia while Russia is an old friend of Persia who always desired the improvement of Persia and who had helped her with Russian officers to better the military strength of Persia. He was sorry that the Persians brought a man named Sinister whose only aim has been to create bad feeling between Persia and Russia and to ruin the good relations existing between them. Shuster only Dies to diminish the honour of Russia and because he is an obstacle in the way of a Russo-Persian alliance, Russia desires his removal. The National Council misunderstood Russia’s intentions and acted contrary to the advice given by Russia and has refused to remove Shuster. Russia was therefore obliged to compel the Council to accept her views and she has therefore sent soldiers to some places in Persia. Russia will withdraw her troops as soon as she has received satisfaction. Russia has no idea of occupving Persia or endangering her integrity. Russia’s only desire is to g ive goodhdvice to Persia.” j (2) “Nobody can mislead the Mujtahids and they would never advise the Persians to act against Russia without good cause. Persia was friendly towards Russia and this friendship was of more use to Kussia than to Persia. “ Mr. Shuster is the subject of a neutral Power. He has no other idea but to place the finances of Persia on a sound footing. Supposing that Mr. Shuster had the idea imputed to him by Mr. Orloff, Russia could have adjusted it without sending an ultimatum and soldiers and without causing excitement in the Moslem world. “ If the object of the Russian Consul’s letter is that the friendship between the two countries should continue, Russia should recall her troops from Persia and withdraw her ultimatum which threatens the integrity of Persia : otherwise the soil of Persia will be red with blood and the Muhammadans will fight so long as a single sheet of the Qaran remains, but they will not be conquered. “ We are also with them and are prepared to give our souls to save Persia from wrongful attacks, and for all bloodshed, etc., those persons will be respons ible who have originated the trouble and who are threatening the country and the souls of Persia without any right.” 8. The “ Najaf ” newspaper of the same date published a telegram sent on the 8th December to the Sultan of Turkey by the following Mujtahids : Muhammad Kazim, Khorasani ; Saiyid Ismail Saddr-ud-Din; Abdullah el Mazandarani; and Muhammad Husain el Hairi el Mazandarani:— “ As Moslems have become victims to attacks from all directions, and as the Muhammadan world is excited, we, as the chief of the 80 millions Shiahs residing in Persia, India and elsewhere unanimously decided to proclaim a Jehad. It is the most important duty of all the Muhammadans to punish those who cause bloodshed to Muhammadans and to protect the religion of Muhammad. “ Now we beg to request that you, who are the bearer of the sacred trust, and who are the servant of Mecca and Madina and the Khalif of Islam, may not decline to give the flag of the Prophet to the Muhammadans who will assemble from all parts of the world for defensive purposes. “ The time for temporising with the policy of Europe has passed. We all request you to give the necessary orders in accordance w ith Muhammadan Law and the law of the Khalifate.” 9. The local press at Baghdad was affected by events at Najaf and during the months of December several very scurrilous articles denouncing England, Russia, Prance and Italy appeared in the “ Zuhur,” the “ Riyadh ” and other * See Anncxure c. papers. The “Riyadh” had an article * entitled “ Humour ” of a particularly rude character. I brought these to the notice of the Wali at an interview, who replied that officially he could do nothing: unofficially he promised to exerthis influence to stop their continuance. The Russian Consul-General, who also interviewed him, advised him to obtain the necessary powers from Constantinople. T also brought these facts to the notice of His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople by telegraph. 10. Towards the end of December news was received here of the murder of Daud Khan (Kalhur) Governor of Kasr-i-Shirin, and of the death of his lieutenant Abdul Karim. Abdul Karim’s brother, who arrived to look after the deceased’s affairs, was reported to have been shot by his widow. 11. Under date 19th December His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Kirmanshah reported that there had been fighting between the 5th and 12th December between Azem-ud-Daulah, representing the Government, and Farukh Khan, the representative of Salar-ud-Daulah. The former were beaten and had to take refuge in the Consulate. Salar-ud-Daulah arrived at Kirinanshah on the 15th December. He is said to have less than 1,000 men under him. He had given orders for the re-establishment of the post and telegraph service. He wishes to restore traffic to enable him to get at the Customs receipts, but Mr. McDouall was doubtful whether he would be able to control the tribes. Salar-ud-Daulah had heard that the Turks had occupied Sakkiz in Kurdistan. 12. The trade routes to Persia have been practically closed for two months by which embarrassment and serious loss has been occasioned to British merchants, as British goods to the value of a quarter million sterling were accumulated here. Within the last week, however, a caravan started for Kirmanshah, the British Insurance Companies having accepted the risk. IV.— Central Arabian affairs. Nil. V.—British interests and cases. 1. I have received a telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that the Porte has paid to the Embassy the sum of £ l\ 5,4i0Q on account of compensation for the demolition of the properties of British subjects at Baghdad and Karbala. This is extremely satisfactory news. 2. Permission has evidently been granted for the building of the residential quarters at Amadia for the Archbishop * * See last Summary,THumi 2 . ^ Canterbury’s Mission there. His Bri tannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople informed the Vice-Consul at Musal that the Council of State had given a decision in its favour and on the latter communicating this to the Wali, His Excellency at once sent orders to the Qaim-Maqam of Amadia to put no obstacle in the way of the building: he also sent an official to Amadia to report on the Qaim-Maqam, and if possible to find a good excuse for his dismissal. The official in question was told to see Dr. Wigram and to ask him “ what he wanted him to do.” Dr. Wigram has informed Mr. Hony that the building has been begun, and that his brother, the architect, has arrived at Bibaydi. 3. In the beginning of December the Pilgrim Agent at Samarrah reported that five Indian pilgrims who w ere on their w r ay thither w r ere robbed en route. He bad brought the matter to the notice of the local authorities who v'ere making search for the robbers. Meanwhile the pilgrims themselves arrived at Baghdad in a deplorabb condition and I had to ask the Charitable Committee at Karbala to make each an allowance of 10 Beige Piastres (about five annas) daily till their case had been attended to. I also brought the matter to the notice of the Wali. I subsequently received information from the Pilgrim Agent that some of the robbers had been apprehended and asking me to either send the pilgrims to Samarrah to identify them or to move the Wali to send the robbers to Baghdad for identification and trial. I again approached the Wali on the10 subject but His Excellency informed me that it was not in accordance with lurlush rules to bring the prisoners to Baghdad, but that the claimants should pmcecd to Samarrah. _ Hie pilgrims have now gone to Karbala where I bone the Charitable Committee will provide them with funds to proceed to India.

The Wall also vvi-ote to enquire why 40 rank and file had on this occasion arrived and remarked that 25-30 used to be the usual number. As no reply had been received up till the evening of the 1st January, I arranged with Messrs. Lynch that the Captain of the mail steamer should take charge of the ammunition on the voyage to Basrah and back, and I also directed that the relieved detachment should not take with them their two boxes of ammunition containing 1,300 rounds.

On the 12th December, at noon, His Majesty the King-Emperor’s Proclamation was publicly read by Captain Norman Scott, His Britannic Majesty s \ ice-Consul, in the absence of Mr. Lorimer, in the grounds of the British Residency. It was afterwards read in Hindustani by the Consular Munshi. Nearly all the British community were present and the British Indian community was also well represented. The Military and Marine detachments wore paraded under the command of Lieutenant Commander Campbell of the R.I.M.S. “ Comet.” After the reading of the Proclamation three cheers were given for the King-Emperor which was heartily responded to by all present. Alter the ceremony sherbet and champagne were passed round and all drank the King-Emperor’s health. It was then suggested by both British and British Indians that a telegram of congratulation should be despatched to the King-Emperor at Delhi. This was accordingly done and the following telegram was received in reply from His Majesty through His Private SecretaryI am commanded to thank you for your kind message.” A translation of the above in Hindustani was circulated for the information of British Indian subjects. The day was observed as a holiday by the British and British Indian community at Baghdad. On the same afternoon Captain and Mrs. Scott (in the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Lorimer) were at home to all the British community including the leading British Indian residents. After sunset the Residency and “ Comet ” were illuminated. The offices of Messrs. Stephen Lynch &amp; Co., Blockey Cree &amp; Co., Sir John Jackson, and the houses of mam r of the Indians were also illuminated. At Karbala the Vice-Consul informed the Mutasarrif, the Commandant of Radi and the Persian Vice-Consul that he would hoist the big flag and illuminate the Vice-Consulate on the 12th December. He did not, however, say that he would hold an official reception. The Turkish flag was hoisted in honour of the occasion as well as that of the Persian Vice-Consul. The Vice- Consul reports that the Mutasarrif called on him unofficially to congratulate and to wish the King-Emperor a long life. A number of the official and non- official classes also called on him during the day.2. Mr. Piittmann, Consul for Belgium, left Baghdad in the beginning of December making over charge of his duties to his assistant Mr. Morck, pending the arrival of Mr. Berk, the Acting Consul. Mr. Berk arrived at Baghdad on the 21st December. There are to be some changes in the German firm of Perk Puttman &amp; Co., as Mr. Puttmann has severed his connection with the firm. 3. Mr. Emil Sauer, Consul for the United States of America, arrived at Baghdad and assumed charge of his duties on the 28th December. 4. Dr. C. M. Schaffter, of the Church Mission Society, arrived at Baghdad in the beginning of December en route for Ispahan. On account of the unsettled and unsafe state of the routes to Persia from here I advised him not to attempt the journey for the present. Dr. Schaffter asked my advice about paying a visit to Karbala in the company of the Beverend Mr. Zwemmer of the American Mission, who happened to be at Baghdad. As his proposal was made to me just at the time of greatest excitement about the Jehad at Najaf I advised him to postpone it. Dr. Schaffter, however, accompanied Mr. Zwemmer. On the 16th December the British Vice-Consul at Karbala informed me that in company with Dr. Schaffter and Mr. Zwemmer he had called at the house of the Mujtahid Saiyid Muhammad Baqir, where mourning service was being held in connection with the death of Mulla Muhammad, Khorasani. They were well received and had a pleasant conversation with the Saiyid on religious topics.

ANNEXURE A. Copy of the religious decree given by Hujjat-ul-Islam wal Muslimiyn Agha Saiyid Muhammad Kazmi, Yezdi, who is the wonder of God in the seven degrees of the earth to the effect that it is the duty of all Muhammadans to protect Muslim countries and to turn out the Russian and English from the Muslim country of Persia and the Italian troops from Tripoli in Africa and not to fail in making every sacrifice of finance and soul. In the name of the Most Merciful God : — To-day the European Powers have attacked Moslem countries from all sides, viz. from one side Italy has attacked Tripoli in Africa and Russia has occupied Northern Persia by means of her troops and Britain has despatched troops to Southern Persia and the existence of Islam is under danger: it is therefore the duty of all Persians and Arab Muhammadans to be prepared to turn out the kufr from Moslem countries and to sacrifice their property and souls for the purpose of turning out the Italians from Tripoli in Africa and the troops of Russia and Britain from North and South of Persia. This is the most important duty of every Muhammadan : nobody should fail in doing his best so that the two Moslem countries, Persia and Turkey, may be saved from all attacks of Christians.

I have been informed by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Aleppo * See ia*t Summ&amp;ry i, 2 . ^ iat Sa’dun Pas'ka * has arrived there and is awaiting his trial which it is understood will take place at Aleppo. 2. The Vice-Consul at Musal reports that on the 21st October a party of merchants travelling from Aleppo to Musal were robbed near Tel ’Afar of goods of the alleged value of £T.250. Lawlessness in the immediate neighbour hood of that town has been steadily on the increase and lately scarcely a week has passed without the occurrence of some incident. It has been the custom to attribute these depredations to the Shammar, but it is difficult to hold them responsible for the present robbery, as most of the tribe has moved south of the Musal Wilayat owing to the high prices of barley and wheat, the result of poor harvests. Mr. Greig thinks that the robbers are probably a gang of Turcomans, in league with certain notables of Musal and of Tel ’.Afar. The authorities have now decided to establish guard-houses for the protection of caravans at two spots where these outrages have been most frequent. 3. Mr. Greig has been informed by the Wali of Musal that his son, Jevdet Bey, who was recently Qaim-Maqam of Nevrokop (Salonika Wilayat) has been appointed Mutasarrif of Hakhiari at Bask-Kala’a (Van Wilaiyat). The Wali attributes the removal of the late Mutasarrif to the lack of energy displayed by the Julamerk authorities in connection with the recent raid near t See last Snmimry i. io. Asheetha.t Tlie present appointment is likely to be most acceptable to Mar Shimun, the Nestorian Patriarch. It will also be welcomed by the Arch bishop of Canterbury’s Mission. 4. The Wali of Baghdad has advertised for a Dragoman with a knowledge of English and Turkish. It is stated that His Excellency is desirous of under standing the views of the Indian newspapers on political questions. This Dragoman will also attend to the Wilaiyat’s correspondence with manufac turers in Europe and America. 5. About the middle of October the British Vice-Consul had occasion to proceed to Najf in connection with the Oudh Bequest, and to take depositions of some witness3s in a case before the High Court at Madras. This appears to have roused the suspicions of the editor of the local newspaper “ Najaf,” who printed the following two articles in the issue of that paper of the 10th Kovember:— (1) “ England and the Moslem World.” “ The English •• re selfish and the whole world knows that they never regard the rights of persons who are weaker than them. “ The European Powers wish to swallow the countries which are in the hands of Muhammadan rulers, but the principal actor in this theatre of tyranny is Britain. “It is Britain which is an Inexorable evil upon the heads of the Muhammadans. She is always an obstacle to the Constitutional Ottomans in their path of impro\^Hnent. Every time the Protecting Powers wish to settle the Cretan question Britain prevents them from doing so. Its object is of course to take some other thing in compensation, if it be decided that Crete should be recognised as Ottoman territory. When she saw that the Ottomans would never sell a piece of their territory, she instigated Italy to occupy Tripoli. “ Britain desires that there should be no Ottoman Government in Africa so that she may easily become the owner of Egypt. 1575 F.

His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal reports that Is’ad Pasha, Commandant of the Xllth Army Corps, left Musal on 21st October for Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah. It was stated that he was on a tour of inspection, but Mr. Greig has reason to anticipate that the tour would be extended to the frontier districts lying between Pesswa and Khanaqin. 3.

The Russian Vice-Consul said that he found no troops between Pesswa and Ravanduz and that the Turkish authorities at Naghirdeh gave him Zantiehs to escort him as far as Ravanduz. He noted repeated signs of lai discipline among the Turkish soldiers in the frontier posts. 6 Mr. Greig further reports that (a) it is said to be the intention of the rr I w’l, -mthorities to gradually replace by Gendarmes the troops on the froiitiCT : (fc)^Captain*named ’A^uniVy Infs been appointed; Administrative nflWr” at Salduz • and (c) a notable of Sulaimamyah named Saiyid A im d B^a Resouh has been appointed - Administrative Officer as Serdesht.

At Baghdad no interest is apparent in the war between Italy and Turkey. r l he people, or at least those engaged in commerce, are much more concerned about the unsettled state of Persia. \\ riting under date ibe 28th October, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah reports that the “ Local Committee of Union and Progress notified to the Mukhtars of the different quarters at Basrah, that, with the permission of the Wali, it had heen decided to hold a public meeting outside the town on h riday the 27th October. At 8 a m. on that day those intending to be present at the meeting began to leave the town, preceded by gangs of Arab coolies who were 1 making hausa/ waring flags and shouting. Then came some hundreds of negroes beating tom-toms. About 40 Arabs mounted on horses and 10 on camels arrived from Zubeir, headed by Muhammad el Meshri and ’Ali Bey es-Sabah, a nephew of the Shaikh of Kuwait. A few Jews of the lower classes also joined the crowd, but the Christians remained in their homes. After a few hours a crowd of about 3,000 had assembled. The Vali was early on the ground waiting in a tent pitched beforehand for his accommodation. “ Patriotic speeches were made, describing how the Italians had occupied Tripoli, and urgingthat every effort should be made to oppose them, intermingled with prayers to strengthen Islam, the Sultan and the Army, and to grant the defeat of the enemy. It was necessary, he said, to proceed to Tripoli, but as the journey was so long, the only practical means left was to render pecuniary aid. 1 hereupon those present threw money into three boxes placed on the ground, about £ T. 15 beim; collected. All the shops in the town were closed and business was suspended until early in the afternoon. In addition to those mentioned, the only persons of any importance present were : Shaikh Abdullah Bashayan : Abdul Wahab Pasha, one of the Deputies of Basrah : Abdul Husain Pasha, Zuhair ; the President of the Civil Court : the Registrar of Births and Deaths : a member of the Court of Appeal : the Commandant of Gendarmerie: and Major Neshat Bey, commanding the 1st Battalion of the 112th Regiment of regular Infantry, which constitutes the present garrison of the town. Shaikh Abdullah Bashayan appears to have been the only member of the Moderate Liberal Club, who attended the meeting. “ The meeting described above, which seems to have been quite uncalled for and which could not conceivably serve any useful purpose, was in several important respects an improvement'on the anti-Greek demonstrations. It was held on the desert outside the town; those taking part in it attended unarmed and no Europeans were molested. Whatever moved its promoters, it can scarcely have been the hope of obtaining subscriptions, for at the meeting held by the Wali at the Sarai on the 22nd instant, and attended by the leading inhabitants a sum of £ T. 500 was promised or subscribed to the Red Crescent Society.” ^ Writing on the same subject on the 5th November 1911 His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal reports as follows : — “ The officers of the XHth Army Corps have offered to contribute a month s salary towards the expenses of the war and to forego one per cent, of their salaries as long as it lasts. * paper of this Wilaiyat, the ‘ Musal,* states that the chiefs of the Rama tribe have offered to furnish a fighting contingent. Their offer was probably prompted by Colonel Refik Bey, the Ottoman Erontier “ A subscription for the Ottoman Navy was opened several weeks ago, but it resulted in practically no donations. Energetic efforts are now being made to raise funds for this purpose, and methods of semi-compulsion may produce a fmr sum. Few, even of the Moslems, have responded with any alacrity. It is believed that about 1,000 Liras have hitherto been collected. There is a talk of increasing the ‘ Temettu ’tax. * c uu*“ The people of Musal remain indifferent to the war. The absence of any attempt on the part of the influential Moslems to kindle fanaticism is due to the tact of Tahir Pasha, who is believed to have the support of all the higher military officers. ’Asuf Effendi, the reactionary editor of the ‘ Nijah ’ paper, has been warned that attempts to cause disturbance will not be tolerated. There has been no move on the part of the 4 Hur-i-Mu’tedil ’. At the same time the influence of the local Committee of Union and Progress is steadily decreasing, and there is great reticence with regard to the Committee on the part of the officers and officials, whilst the notables are unanimously outspoken in condemnation of it. “ The authorities are daily circulating reports of Italian reverses, some of which emanate originally from the Brouasa branch of the Committee of Union and Progress. “ Official indignation is directed at least as much against Germany as Italy. It is understood that the Musal Deputies have been instructed to use their influence against German enterprises. The Wali observed to me a few days ago that there may be surprises when the plans of the Baghdad Railway Company are submitted to the Porte for approval in a few months. “ During the past few days reports have been circulated to the effect that Imam Y ahya is on his way to Tripoli with a large force of Arabs to help the Turks, that the Italians have been driven out of Tripoli with great loss, and that England, Prance and Russia are intervening on behalf of Turkey. The authorities made efforts to provoke a display of popular satisfaction at these tidings, but failed completely. Officers and officials here are declaring without reserve that the friendship of England will in future be sought bv Turkey and that they are now alive to the worth of German support The ‘ Niiah ’ recently quoted an article from the ‘ Ikbal,’ which is printed v Beyrouth, ascribing the outbreak of the war to the policy of England any Prance in northern Africa. I am informed that the Vali sent for Asuf EttencU the editor, and requested him to abstain from publishing articles of the kind. “ The landowners of the Erbil district are complaining of the diminishing export of wheat owing to the war. “ The following is a telegram which has passed through Musal from the Muntafic Deputy to the Muntafik Arabs :— “ As you know the Italians, who are the biggest enemies of our religion, have attacked Tripoli, an important part of our Empire. Its inhabitants consist of both Sunnis and Shiahs. They have for nearly a month fought energetically against^ the unbelievers (Kafarecn) in order not to he cut off from the Khalifate and the Ottoman Government. They are still fighting and—-thanks to God!—they have defeated the unbelievers and inflicted great loss on them. They have also retaken most of the places captured by the Italians in Tripoli. According to the Sheri’at all Moslems are bound to help in the struggle with their money and persons for the sake of God. Therefore obedient to the faith and its laws you, like other Mhslem communities, should contrL - bute funds. Otherwise, which God forbid, foreigners and unbelievers will rule over you, and you will be deprived of your religion and homes.” 10 It is reported that the Central Office of the Committee of Union and Progress at Salonika has sent a Confidential letter to the Baghdad branch of the Committee to the effect that the present Walls of Baghdad and Basrah aie members of the Committee and that Ittihidians should always support them. 11 The head of the Postal and Telegraph Department at Baghdad has issued a circular intimating that under arrangements recently made, letters will in future be conveyed to Aleppo in 7i days : to Beyrouth m 9 days, and to Constantinople in 14 days: also that letters from Europe despatched by Ottoman post will be received at Baghdad quicker than by any other existing routes.6 The Ottoman Post offices at Baghdad and Musal have never been worked * see summary for September 11,1. satisfactorily,* and so recently as the 8th ^ „ November, His Britannic Maiesty’s Vice- Consul wrote as follows on the Musal post office “ It would be impossible to exaggerate the dilatory, slovenly and dishonest way in which the postal service is conducted in this district Sixteen days have elapsed since the last mail was received from Constantinople. Such a delay at this time of the year is inexcusaoiG. III.— Persian Affairs. -d i 1 ! ’^d-ud-Daulah, a brother of the ex-Shah Muhammad ’Ali, arrived at Karbala ^ ® asra ^ a bout the middle of November and has since proceeded to ’Azd-ud-Daulah was a Constitutionalist and is said to have held a 'ood appointment under the new Government, but when his brothers Muhammad All and SaJar-ud-Daulah, invaded Persia he threw in his lot with them. It is stated that he has since repented of his action and has tendered his submission to the Mejhss. Sakr-ud-Daulah, who is said to be somewhere near Kirmanshah has threatened to kill him in consequence. 2. Among the Persian notables at present in Baghdad are— (1) Shaukat-us*Sultanah, Inspector of Customs, Arabistan. (2) Muhtashim-us-Sultan, ex-Governor of Kirmanshah, appointed bv Salar-ud- Haul a h. (5) Saiyid Akbar Shah, who had occasion to taKe refuge at the Bussian Consulate at Kirmanshah. 3. There has been no post from Kirmanshah during the month of N ovember, and merchants, both foreign and Ottoman, are much concerned about the unsettled state of affairs in Persia. His Excellency' the Mali, who called on me privately on the 30th November, informed me that the local merchants had asked him to permit their goods to be conveyed to Persia under a Turkish guard, a request which he felt bound to refuse. IV.— Central Arabian Affairs. 1. With reference to the rumoured concentrationf of Arabs on an enormous t See last Summary iv, 2 . scale some where near Najd, I am now _. T , given to understand that some learned Muhammadans of the Hijaz, Damascus, etc., are trying to organise an exten sive meeting or “ Congress” at Makka to consult about measures for a pau- Islamic union. Sheikh Ahmed, a learned Muhammadan of Baghdad, has received a letter from Makka in which the writer, who is one of the Ulema of Makka, enquires whether the Muhammadans of Baghdad will send deputies if asked to attend. 1 V.—British Interests and Cases. 1. The name of the British Indian subject referred to under this head in paragraph 3 of the Summary for October 1911, is Hajji Muhammad Musa and not Saiyid Husain as therein stated. 2. I have received the following further particulars from His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal, about the Archbishop of Canterbury’s “ This Mission is being reinforced by a Clergyman and a dispenser. The dispenser, Mr. Deed, has spent the past year in England qualifying for his present work. He previously served for several years in the Mission at Urmi, Koshannes, and Van. It is proposed to open in Amadia itself a small dispensary for the Moslems, and this will do much to enhance the influence and popularity of the Englishmen at Bibayadi. Dr. Wigram’s brother, who is an architect, is7 also expected shortly. He will superintend the building of the nremices nt Bibayadi Although no ‘ Barman ’ has yet been received? the Wali has at last the Mis n sbu° n No I 111 * 7 ‘j 10 , bu 1 iW . i 1 n S of the residential quarters for Farman a^iyes.

The Ambassador was able to obtain an order from the Minister of Telegraphs against this restriction, but on the 5th November the Vice-Consul had again to bring this subject to the notice of the Embassy as the local authorities persisted in their refusal and denied the receipt of any fresh orders on the subject. 3. The claim preferred by His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal * See Summary for September n, n. against the Turkish Postal * Department v»o 0 rwv™. u Ail i d i i -r^ ^ or ^ ie * oss ^ W0 registered letters, ^-been settled by that Department paying him the legal compensation VII. Foreign Interests and Official Matters (except Persian and British). tt- i’ J he . foI i2 W . ing are extracts fr om a report dated the 5th November from His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal “ (ci) The Baghdad Bailway. “ The party of Engineers who are surveying under Mons. Auble, Chief of the third section of the line, between Hegna and Musal, have returned to this town, having completed that portion of their work. They are likely to remain for the present here, drawing up a report of the survey from Nisibin to Musal. “ Two more y° un g engineers recently arrived from Aleppo, an Armenian named Serovepe Hurmuz, and a Greek named Karydas. The former has had experience of railway engineering in the Congo, the latter has served in a land Company in Egypt. They are surveying from Musal towards Baghdad. They have hitherto remained in close proximity to the river. They are one of four parties who are carrying out the survey between Musal and Baghdad. None of the other three parties, who are working in the opposite direction, have yet entered this Wilayat. “ There are indications that instructions have been received to complete the survey and draw up the plans for submission to the Porte as speedily as possible. I gather that alternate plans will be made in case of the Porte rejecting any part of those first submitted. Mr. Auble tells me that 3508 kilometres remain to be surveyed between Musal and Baghdad. There is now no further room for doubt that the main line w/tll pass through Musal, and that the stretch between Hegna and Musal will be part of the main line. The railway station will be at the southern extremity of the town. “ In a recent conversation M. Auble told me that he has no further news of the Englishman, who applied for service on the Baghdad railway. A German engineer, who was present, observed that Englishmen are generally specialists in some one branch of engineering, and that for that reason they rarely combine the knowledge of surveying and construction, which the Company requires. “ Meissner Pasha is expected here in about a fortnight. M. Auble’s wife and family will arrive with Meissner Pasha, and all the engineers are making preparations for living some years in Musal. “ (6) Kirkuk Irrigation Scheme. “I am informed by an Englishman who was recently at Altun Kupri that an attempt to drive a canal from a point on the Lesser Zab about nine hours E. N. E. of Altun Kupri towards Kirkuk has failed after some three months work. The failure was due to the hilly nature of the land north of Kirkuk. It was foreseen by His Majesty^ Consul*General at Baghdad when he 'visited the Kirkuk district last year. “ A canal is now being cut from Mella, a point on the river about 12 miles S. E. of Altun Kupri, towards Kirkuk. Two hundred men are employed at wages ranging from seven to ten tariff piastres per diem. _ Great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining sufficient labour and a strike of the workmen with a view to better pay is threatened. The partially obliterated remains of an ancient canal exist, running in the same direction as the present one. It is not how r ever being utilised. “ l n the Erbil and Kirkuk districts the general feeling is that money will be spent with very little result. ** (c) Improvements on the JHusal- Kirkuk and 31usal-Havanduz routes. «Three hundred liras have been assigned towards modifying the slope leading from the ground-level to the highest point of the bridge at Altun Kupri. “ The construction of the bridge over the Greater Zab at Kelek is being hurried on. The Chief Engineer of this Wilayat has recently made several journeys to Kelek to inspect the works. Ihc stone pieis destined to Ctinv tlu approach to the bridge over the extensive swamps on either bank have reached the channel on both sides. “ The local authorities have bought for this work from Messrs. Lynch’s agency in Musal a pump for 140 Liras, and from another British firm in Baghdad 800 barrels of Portland Cement. «* It is announced that a road is shortly to replace the rough track bet ween Erbil and Bavanduz. “ A bridge is being being built over the Hahuk Sou at Hakuk. According to all account very little has yet been done.” 2. Begarding the navigation of the Euphrates, the following is a note by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Aleppo : — “The Resident at Baghdad lias reported the failure of Nazim Pasha’s ‘fantastic scheme’ of employing motor-boats for regular service on^ the Euphrates. It would be interesting to know whether Mr. Lorimer is of opinion that all such schemes on the Euphrates valley are likely to end similarly owing to pure physical difficulties, or whether Nazim Pasha’s ill- success is not rather due to the circumstance of those particular boats having been rashly ordered out from England by natives who were too ignorant or careless to realise (and describe to the builders) the conditions of navigation for which they were required. “ At the moment of writing (24th October) a much larger boat, constructed by Messrs. Boyes, Skilston of Cairo, is undergoing her trials at Meskene. She9 m is intended by the native Syndicate (Krikorian and Kuriaki) to whose order she was built, to transport merchandise (rather than passengers) between Meskene and Paluja. “ An experiment which, so far as I am aware, has not yet been tried is that of a powerful tug to take ‘ Chacturs * or other flat-bottomed craft in tow. I am inclined to think something of this kind might prove more feasible than either motor-hoats or steamers.” 3. At Baghdad also there has been a large influx of Germans. They are I engaging houses at exorbitant rates, and paying rent three years in advance. 4. Mr. Greig, who passed through Baghdad on his way to Beyrouth last j week, informs me that a Baron Oppenheim, who is encamped on the Tipper Euphrates, is actively intriguing with the Aniza Arabs to drive the Shammar from their encampments. It is said that the Shammar view with dislike the approach of the German Railway, and that the Germans fear that they will 1 interfere with the permanent way. 5. Meissner Pasha arrived at Baghdad on the 28th November accompanied by his family. VIII.— Commercial matters. 1. Under date the 28th October, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah reported as follows :— « Early in October it was decided to permit the export of dates to Levant ports. Owing to fear of seizure by the Italians the Russian S.S. ‘ Phrat ’ did not take a full cargo, while the second Russian steamer ‘ Vesta,’which departed about the 20th instant, was overloaded, news having been received that dates ■were not considered contraband of war by the Italians. 2. On the 28th November I received a telegram from Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. of London asking my assistance to prevent the departure from Baghdad of Mr. Aziz of the firm of * See last Summary HI, 1. last paragraph. Aziz-asll-Shuker,* wllO is indebted to them in the sum of over £stg.1,000. Messrs, t see Summary for September ii, 6 Weir’s agent at Baghdad is Abdul Qadir t Pasha, Khadhairi, who called on me on the morning of the 29th in connection with this case. It was arranged that a letter should be written to the Wali asking His Excellency to pre/ent Mr. Aziz’s departure for Musal until he had given satisfactory security for the settlement of the claim against him, I am glad to report that the Mali’s prompt action resulted in the apprehension of Mr. Aziz who had that morning left Baghdad en route for Musal. XX.—Miscellaneous and General. 1 Mr. Lorimer, accompanied by the 2nd Dragoman Mr. Abdur Rabb, and bv Suiiad Ali Khan and Agha Taqi Khan, two of the leading Indian residents here, left for India on the morning of the 7th November to attend the Imperial Durbar at Delhi. 2. Basrah has been declared free from cholera since the 6th November, and there is now no restriction on the arrivals and departures of steamers to and from that port. _ . . 3 Information has been received from the Director of Criminal Intelligence, Simla, that Muhammad t See summary for November 1910 . Talaat,! correspondent of the Egyptian newspaper “ A1 Muayyid,” has left Bombay for Dubai. A look-out will be kept for his arrival here and his movements watched. 4. Mr. H. E. Hony has succeeded Mr. Greig as His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Musal. The latter gentleman left Baghdad for Basrah en route for Beyrouth on the 21st November. 5. The local Telegraph authorities have this year raised no objection to the despatch by this office of free weather telegrams to the Meteorological Office10 at Simla, and such telegrams have been regularly sent since the 1st November. , , 6 * rams have set m rather early this year. Between the 31st October and 13th November 072 inches of rain has been registered. Arab cultivators do not consider this a good omen and anticipate a scanty rainfall towards the end ot the season, when it is most needed.
