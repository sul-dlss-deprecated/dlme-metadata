Sir P. Cox regarding a claim of the Imperial Ottoman Bank against the German firm of Wonckhaus at Basra. It may be inferred from these papers that the authorities in Basra are, on the analogy of the Indian practice, treating the Imperial Ottoman Bank as a 'hostile A firm' licensed to trade under control ; and Wonckhaus as a 'hostile firm' licensed to liquidate. The process of liquidation of the latter firm involves the discharge of local liabilities.and it is believed that had this case occurred in India the debts due by the firm in liquidation,either to British subjects or to a firm licensed to trade under control, would have been discharged. From this point of view therefore the status of the Ottoman Bank at Basra is immaterial, and Mr. Chamberlain would propose - with Sir E. Grey’s concur rence - to instruct Sir P.

In my opinion, although for the reason above given I can ^nly express it as my own view, the Contract between the Banks was one which was dissolved and not merely sus pended on the outbreak of var. It ms I think of the essence of the Contract that the Agency duties of the Ottoman Bank should be discharged and should be capable of being discharged without break or interruption find I think that the restriction upon the Imperial Bank of Persia itself opening any branch or agency in the province of Bagdad or Bussorah was conditional and dependent upon the agency duties assumed by the Ottoman Bank being dis charged without interruption, on the principle- of such case as general Billgos ti ng Co. v Atkinso n 1909, A.C.118.

In any case, hovfover, the Ottoman Bank, even if enabled to sue in an English Court, would not, in my opinion, be entitled to have enforced as against the Imperial Bank of Persia a contract which by English law was dissolved by the war* In my opinion therefore the answer to the first ques tion is in the affirmative unless the position be affected by any subsequent license granted on behalf of Bis Majesty to the Ottoman Bank* That must of course necessarily depend upon the terms of the license which are not before me but in my view the chances are that the position can not be affected by the license whatever its terms may be* I think that the Contract was dissolved on the out break of war and there has been an appreciable interval o f time during which no license was in existence* Purther- more there has been an appreciable interval of time during which the Province of Bagdad and Bussorah remained after the outbreak of war in Turkish occupation and during that period no British license for a Turkish branch locally situate would either be effective or even capable of being granted* Again if the Ottoman Bank license is in anything like the form of the licenses which have been granted by the Secretary of State to the London Branch of German and Austrian Banks it would not be sufficient to restore such an agency as is constituted by this Agreement*% L And, «*T8n if, hiring raga'd to the axisting British occupation of th* t»o Turkish prorinoae, these Provinces (?) “ U * t Slt i9ast 3,0 far as offaotiveiy oceupiod now under the recant Proel.-unation he treated a* British territory still, any license, if it ware granted to a Turkish Bank in that territory would not X think in ail probability hare any acre extensive operation than a license granted to the branch of the same Bank in England• In the result therefore I think this question should be.answered in the affirmative.

Meanwhile I beg to make following representations for such consideration and action as may be possible. Firstly it has been found that owing to fact that Bank has been regarded as state Institution report that branch is about to reopen in its old name is accepted as confirmation of prevailing apprehension that Basrah may be returned to Turkish Government at end of war c Well wishing notables at Basra d at Mohammerah have urged on me importance of change of designation for above reason. Secondly Supply of funds alone will not keep Branch going. I understand that former operations were mainly with Baghdad and in Turkey and consisted partly of ordinary commercial as apart from legitimate Banking business. It had little or no connection with India or Gulf. Mow that it is deprived of business with Turkey and local trade is stagnant, it will have no foundation on wnich to rebuild business, whilst its working expenses are not less than d?250 monthly. Under the circumstances seems to be not impossible that Directors will decide to wind up this Branch or perhaps dispose of it to some British Institution on suitable terms and such course would certainly be in our political interests. If on the other hand Directors decide17976. 1.1694. 10,000.-11/1914. [1.211.] COPY OF TELEGRAM. From Dated Received at London Office decide in favour of maintaining it# I venture to recommend that if possible it should be given status of v subsidiary Sank and opened with new name: and secondly that present Manager and Submonager^ who are Baghdad Jew and English Levantine of French Extraction respectively should be transferred to other branches and be replaced by Englishman. Supervisor informs me that though they have been personally helpful and civil to him, an examination of the 3ank°s papers indicates management acted with culpable negligence and disregard of British and French Interests in rejecting opportunities afforded them of getting rid of large amount of cash ^hich thi j held on declaration of war and which they ultimately had to hand over to Turks. Thus management was instructed 2nd f/ovemb.er last to purchase drafts on other Branches up to a maximum of z£4Q„Q0(h Agaiyi a local American Firm was pressing them up to end of October to give cash in exchange for such drafts and even up to 18th November last they were instructed by Bead Office to reduce their cash by discharging local liability including debt of &lt;£15,000 to Imperial Bank of Persia# at Mohammerah.

As the Government are permitting these ship ments to take place, there does not appear to he any reason why the Basra, Branch should not finance such shipments by discounting the bills drawn upon consignees, hut I think the Management of the Branch should, before discounting such bills, satisfy themselves that the drawers are substantial people who will be able to repay'the advances to the Bank in the event of the bills not being met at maturity. Without further knowledge of the matter, this latter eventuality appears to me to be likely, as the acceptors are Turkish subjects resident in enemy territory, who presumably are forbidden to make payments to the aluies. ( 3 ) I do not think that any business other than that mentioned in (2) should be entered into between Basra and J ed dah. I have mentioned your enquiries to the London Management, and they would very much like to know before anything is done by Basra, the extent of the . transactions to be undertaken in (2), so that they may concur in the proposed action of the local Management in dealing therewith.

Dear Sir, Having now learned from Sir P. Cox’s telegram of the V 28th January that both Turkish Government money and rupees are legal tender in Basra, and having received some further information regarding existing conditions at the Port, we desire to place he- -fore you more definite proposals regarding the working of the Branch of our Bank there than we were able to make to Sir William Plender before he despatched his letter to the India Office of the 29th January, We would place our services at the disposal of the Government :(lAr^J (i) for the banking of any sums of money remitted for the payment of Government Servants of Government contracts, and (ii) to receive and account for any Government dues which may be payable in the Occupied Area. We understand that an ad valorem duty of 10^ has been imposed on Imports, and we presume that as the British forces advance, payments will become due on account of taxes payable in the Occupied country. That we are justyied in offering to undertake this duty is, we submit, to be inferred from the fact that we have hitherto been in the habit of receiving and accounting for taxes payable to the Turkish Government. With the occupation of the Hinterland, there seems every reason to believe that trade in Basra will become more active, and it will be obviously to the advantage of the British and Indian Governments that no step necessary to facilitate its development should be wanting We are enquiring into the actual state of Commerce at the Port, as we hear that there is grain there that might be shipped, and when we are informed on this point we may find it advisable to have funds there. In that case perhaps it would be eventually possible for the Government of India to arrange to send rupees to our Basra Branch^' Basra Branch “by one of the Government steamers leaving India for the Persian Gulf, and we could pay the Secretary of State for India for those rupees, by lodging sums to his credit in London. We understand that there would be no objection on the part of the British Government to bank with an Institution bearing a Turkish name, while the country remains Turkish in British occupation, but should the position eventually be modified, we might, if desirable, form a Bank under a new title, registered as a British Company, to take over the business of our Branch in Basra and to act for the British Government.

Sir Edward Grey considers that the question, which does not primarily concern this Department, should be decided by the Directors of the Bank on their own responsibility; and he therefore caused the Chairman to be informed orally that if the Board desired to obtain his consent or approval of the undertaking, they should submit for his consideration the definite opinion of a Counsel of standing based on the statements in a case laid before him (instead of the somewhat vague and c The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(6943/15) illusory letter of the Bank's solicitors enclosed herein) and also, as the agreement between the two Banks is governed by Persian law, an opinion from an expert in Persian law, stating clearly what the posi- tion under that code was. Tne chairman of the Bank was informed at the same uime txiat if the Bank decided to proceed with the matter without further reference to this Department, the question must rest with the Board of Directors. Sir T. Jackson fully realized the position thus explained to him and allowed it to be understood that his Bank did not desire to avoid responsibility but to consult the convenience of this Department; as, therefore, Sir E. Grey had placed no definite prohibition on political grounds on the proposal, the Bank would proceed forthwith to open a branch at Basra. Sir E.

As they have now I ceased to carry on business in Bussorah they are con sequently no longer able to carry out the bargain they , had made, to act as your Agents. it is, we under stand, essential to your interests that you should be represented there, and in the existing state of things you must necessarily take other steps for this purpose. The question upon which we are asked to The Agreement contemplated that tney should The Geo. Newell Esq., Imperial Bank of Persia, 25, Abchurch Lane, E.C.The Agreement was made in Teheran, and your rights under it would be governed by Persian law. «e are asked to assume that Persian law is analogous to our own. If so, we think that the inability of the Imperial Ottoman Bank to further perform the Agreement would Justify you in treating it as no longer existing. It would not be practicable, as a business matter to revert to the old position, after the war, even if the Imperial Ottoman Bank were then prepared to again fulfil their obligations, hence it is that you may treat the Agreement as at an end. tie assume that the Foreign Office and the Persian Government will concur in what you propose to do.

BASRA BRANCH. I am ohliged for yohr letter of Hie 2Gtli instant transmitting copy of a telegram dated 25tli January received from the Viceroy. I am informed by the London rjanagement that the business of the Basra Branch In the past has consisted large- ly of facilitating (by the purchase of drafts or making pay ments against credits) the export by British Merchants from the Port of Basra of Merchandise brought d wn fr m the Hlnter land, and in financing to a considerable extent the import trade. As the trade with the Hinterland Is temporarily cut iff, that portion of the business of the Basra Branch will cease, and it is not easy for the London Agency to indicate the nature of any new business which may be undertaken. The Management in London are, however, desirous for their Basra Branch to undertake any new business which may be offered o them and are anxious and willing to render any services o the Government if requested. Before the Branch can - 1 -effectively re-commenee business it is necessary to know tlie local currency to be adopted, and I ventured to address an # x enquiry to you on tins subject on the 26th instant• A yin * (tfYtyYrvwi - \du i fa h. b' t'dvrA. _ . . am 'l/f The London Management have already written to Basra informing the Managers of that Branch that they must refrain from having any relations directly or indirectly with any firms or persons in Germany, Austria or Turkey or Branches abroad of German, Austrian or Turkish Banks or firms other than the Branches of the Bank in London, Paris,' Cyprus and -Egypt, with the three latter of which the London Agency is permitted under its Licence to communicate and carry on business. Copies of the Government Licences issued to the London Agency on the 80th November and 8th January and copies of the Royal Proclamations of the 9th September and 7th January have been forwarded to Basra. As regards the Supervision in London, my represen tatives at the London Branch of the Bank see all foreign letters and telegrams received find despatched. Those re ceived are delivered by the Post Office direct to the Official Supervisor, who signs a receipt upon their delivery, and foreign telegrams and letters sent by the Bank are marked with a stamp ’’Official Supervisor - Imperial Ottoman Bank” after they have been approved: only those so marked are per mitted to be despatched. The Supends or is als®' in constant consultation with the Management. The Imperial Ottoman Bank is, as you are probably aware, almost entirely controlled by English and French in terests, and only in the sense that its constitution and principal domicile is Turkish can it be regarded as an enemy. I would suggest that the local Supervisor would exercise sufficient control if he were to make effective ar rangements to see ail correspondence and telegrams received and transmitted by the Basra Branch, and to approve thelatter before .despatch, and in addition it might he well for all moneys to he placed under the joint control of the Bank and the Supervisor, which would effectively prevent any pay ments being made to or for the benefit of the enemy. I am informed that the staff of the Bank consists of Mr. D. S. Maud. Acting Manager. (Not a British subject). Mr. L. le Bouvier. Ac1ing Sub-Manager.
