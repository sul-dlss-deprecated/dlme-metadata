Kas Mo&amp;osed^ The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf/, and the K Government of Indiay agree^that a gratuity of Rs.943 should he paid to Mr. G. Bayer, v/ho was until recently employed at the Kov/eit Agency as Mechanical Engineer. Mr. Bayer has served in that capacity on an unestahlished basis for 19 years, and his service has been entirely satisfactory. He became paralysed some months ago, and had to be removed to India. He is not expected to recover sufficiently to resume v/ork. The expenditure will be met from the fixed Launch Grant of the Agency, and will result in an excess of Rs.793 on that grant during the current year. This excess requires the prior sanction of the Secretary of State. The expenditure will, it is anticipated, b£ covered by savings under other sub-heads. Although the Launch Grant is a divisible item, it is unnecessary to seek the concurrence of the Treasury, as the amount involved is under £100. Sanction is requested accordingly, and a draft letter to the Government of India is submitted.

Prom To The Hon’hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Subject:- Proposed'payment of a gratuity to nr. C.Bayer, the Kuwait Agency Mechanical Engineer and Launch Driver. Sir, I have the honour to forward copies of the marginally-noted references from the Political Agent, Kuwait, * recommend- t 1. Letter No. 412 'dated 't'h'e^'aina J'une and accompaniment. 2. Extracts,'paragraphs 1 and 2, of Express* ing the latter No. 457 dated the 6th July 1956, * — payment of a gratuity to Mr. G. Bayer, the Agency Mechanical Engineer and Launch Driver, who has been disabled by a stroke of paralysis and sent to India under medical advice. 2. Mr. Bayer’s terms of service are not embodied in a written contract, but in consideration of his long and efficient service extending over a period of 19 years during which he has enjoyed only 3 months' leave I consider that it is only just that he should be given a sum of money equivalent to the leave salary and passage money to which he wou^d, in equity, be entitled in the absence of a definite contract.3. I recommend that a sum of Rs.S43/-, made up as follows, may be paid to Mr. Bayer from the Kuwait Agency Launch Grant: (d) (c) (d) (a) Return deck passage without food for one attendant from Kuwait to Bombay. One 2nd class passage, without food, from Kuwait to Bombay. Leave salary for 3 months on half pay. Leave salary for 3 months on full pay. Rs 157 Rs 240 Rs 480 Rs 66 Total Rs 943 4 Of the above amount Rs 150/- can be met from anticipated savings in the Kuwait Agency Launch Grant and the balance by reappropriation from savings under other sub-heads in the current yearns budget of the Persian Gulf Residency. The expenditure will, however, result in an excess of Rs 793/- over the fixed Launch Grant of the F .wait Agency of Rs 2500/-, which will need to be regularised in due course. 5. I, therefore, request that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction the proposed expendi ture of Rs 943/- in the current year under Kuwait -C.4 Supplies and Sc vices - Maintenance of Launch”. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- Illegible for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.the Political of letter No t Agent, Kuwait 412 dated the 22nd June 1936 from I have the honour to state that Ur. Cyril Bayer, the Agency Uechanical Engineer was on the 23rd Uay seized with a paralytic stroke. According to Medical Officer he is not likely to regain complete use of his limbs for some time if ever. 2. Bayer is not on pensionable service but I feel that after nineteen years here in the service of the Agenby (he U( is not about 43) he deserves some special gratuity. 3. While he is here, that is until he is well enough to move, I propose to keep him in pay out of the lauiSi fund, but as another man must be taken on in his place this will completely exhaust the lai^ch fund and leave me no i^oney whatsoever for petrol and oil during the current year. 4 . His character h ±s been exemplary. Colonel Dickson has written of him in praiseworthy terms, see the attached letter, b. In all the circumstances I shall be most grateful if you will be pleased to contemplate sanction of Ks. 1000/- as a special payment to Bayer on leaving Kuwait which will perhaps be in two months time when he will be well enough to be moved, but almost helpless without assistance for a long time, if not for ever. 6. I shall address you again when the course of his illness is clearer but should be grateful if I be informed if you would favourably regard some such grateity, if the course is as I visualize above in pa a 5.D.O Kuwait Oil Coy., Kuwait, 14.6.36. My dear De Gaury, Thanks for your note of 12th June regarding Mr. Bayer’s work for the Agency and your decision to try an r) get something out of Government In recognition of his past work. I am truly pleased to here that you are going to try and Interest Government, for a more deserving and worthy case you could not find anywhere. Mr. Bayer came to Kuwait when Captain M’Cullum was Political Agent (somewhere about 1916 I believe). He was engaged and sent down from Basra by the then Chief Political Officer’s office to work the Agency Launch- He has v/orked In Kuwait ever since, both as Agency Launch driver, and later In my time as Electrical and Mechanical Engineer In charge of the Agency Electric Supply plant which Government installed In the old Agency (1933-34) in addition to his Launch duties. Mr. Bayer also had charge of the Agency Staff’s bicycles and the Political Agent’s motor cars from time to time. My predecessor Col. More thought very highly Indeed of Mr. Bayer’s engineering capabilities and promoted him steadily in the matter of pay from a small starting salary. When I came to Kuwait I carried on my predecess or's policy and by small annual increments raised his pay to what it now stands. Mr. Bayer In ray opinion is much more than an ordinary marine engine mechanic and driver. He has the engineering instinct, is a thoroughly capable man and has real knowledge of all forms of internal combustion engines. Last but not least he can cut(steal and fashion all but the biggest spare parts for any I.C.Engine, as an/-an example in 1934, when the ’cam’ shaft of the Government 'Kohler' Engine snapped, he set to work and in seven days turned out a completely new one with only local tools and 'hone made' lathe to help him - a very fine performance. As regards character, Mr. Bayer has been all that could he desired in the 18 years he has worked for the Agency in Kuwait and never hy word or act has he let the good name of the Agency down. He has always been sober and abstemious and has on more than one occasion earned the high praise of Shaikh Sir Ahmad al jabir al Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., the Ruler. I earnestly trust that you will be successful in getting a gratuity for Mr. Bayer, who though in an un pens i enable post, has by sheejt merit and devotion to work worked his way up to his present position after 18 years Government service in the Gulf. That he was suddenly been struck down by paralysis is no fault of his. If anyone deserves well of Government Mr. Bayer does. Yours sincerely, Sd/- H.R.P. Dickson.Extracts from Express Letter No* 6th July 1936. Reference my letter No. 412 dated the 22nd June 1936 regarding this Agency Mechanical Engineer, Ur. G. Bayer, who has no contract. 2. This situation now is that (a) on the recommenda tion of Doctors of the American Mission and this Agency, Mr. Bayer leaves for India on the 8th inst. It has also been recommended that he should be accompanied by a man to look after during the voyage to Bombay. (b) I have had to take on a man in his place as from the 1st June 1936. (c) I shall count Bayer as on leave for 3 months as he has had no leave since 1926, when he had 3 months leave for the first time since his employment in 1918. (d) According to the Doctors here there is little hope of his complete recovery and certainly not for 6 months or a year.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00021a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/215</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00021a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/215</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 7836/36 'Grant of a gratuity to Mr. C.
