I v^: Russian Minister and I have ^been in constant -discussion with Persian Government as to the method to give effect to Agreement of August last, the crux being the drafting Of Ministerial decree instituting the new financial Otenission. Prime Minister some days ago gave us a draft prepared by himself obliged to reject but he has now intimated his readiness to aecept one drafted by ourselves. Our draft is a more formal document than that enclosed in my despatch No*i02 but in respect of its substance generally agrees with it. We have however thought it better as far as possible to leave the initiative and responsibility in th© hands of Persian Government and it does not therefore, as did the former, confer on the Commission the power to draw up budget or initiate financial laws but Corralssion will have full powers of control and audit of veto of any undesirable taxation and expenditure and of the removal of delinquent financial officials, while, the assent of British and Russian delegates is requisite to all its important decisions. If -fV t If the Pernian Government accept our draft and address us a note undertaking to issue it as decree Russian Minister and I propose to consider this satisfactory without referring it to our Governments as to do so would entail most undesirable delay, n^t only as regards the formation of the Commission itself hut also in connection with the formal institution of Southern Persian rifles and increase of Cossack brigade.

VII. Persia to have representatives, with merely deliberative power, at peace conference. VIII. Non-indemnification of British subjects for losses suffered in Persia during the war -period. As regards I. Persian Government admit tint, we cannot concede this and would be satisfied with affirmative reply qualified by some condition, fulfilment of which would depend on ourselves e.g. that neutral officers must be selected by common agreement between the three Powers.

[197733] Sir C. Marling to Viscount Grey.—(Received October 4.) (No. 105. Very Confidential.) Mv Lord, Gulhek August 26, 1916. IN my despatch No. 26 of the 24th March last, I endeavoured to sketch the course of events under the short-lived administration of Farman Earma, and in the present despatch I propose to submit a summary outline of Sipahsalar’s Ministry, and of the causes which led to his fall from power. It is seldom that a Government has taken office in Persia with a fairer prospect of a long term of office. The Cabinet itself was avowedly pro-Russian and contained no discordant elements. Russian troops were in practical occupation of the capital and north-western and northern provinces, and, within a few days of its taking office, its sole possible rival, Earman Earma, w^as removed from the scene by his appointment to Kerman. It was this very sense of security which rendered Sipahsalar’s administration of internal affairs so eminently unsatisfactory. Nothing else, perhaps, could have been expected of such a feather-brain as the new Prime Minister, and when it is remembered that Sipahsalar, in addition to his light-hearted insouciance, is also both lazv and ignorant, it is perhaps surprising that things have not been worse. That they were not so is due to the influence of Saram-ed-Dowleh. Except for a certain personal attractiveness often found in Persians of good family Sipahsalar and Akbar Mirza seem scarcely to have a single common quality. In spite of ins 70 years and great experience, Sipahsalar is hopelessly ignorant, and is vam, capricious, lazy, and easilv influenced by those who have his ear, while Akbar Mirza, who is still in his early thirties, has a breadth of view, a constancy, a sense of justice, and a grasp of affairs which, if they would not render him conspicuous m Europe, raise him head and shoulders above the crowd of living Persian politicians Fortunately Sipahsalar was usually ready to defer to his able young colleague, and it was thanks to the latter’s influence and good sense that I have been able eithei to check or to remedy many of Sipahsalar’s more crazy actions in questions of interest to ourselyes ThTs despatch would be overlong if I catalogued all the Prime M.mster’s incredible blunders, and it will be sufficient for me to mention some of the most riarinf instances e g., his obstructive attitude towards Farman Farmas mission to Pars 11 his* 1 encouragement of Soulet-ed-Dowleh Kashgai, his abrupt dismissal of Sardar-i-Nosret from the Deputy-Governorship of Kerman and, above all, his policy of‘‘ baiting ” the Bakbtiaris, which began when he assumed office, and was terminated ° nly In another matter also the Cabinet was extraordinarily careless to its own interest and security namely, in its misplaced clemency towards the leading Germanophils and German a-ents in the Capital, and, except in Shiraz and Kerman, in the provinces also. °I constantly urged on them that such men as /ahir-u - u anc Mukhber es Sultaneh in Tehran should be arrested or exiled, and the brigands who had E Sman pay, such as Ali-Khan-Siahkuhi, Naib Hussein, and Sardar-i-Soulet should be captured and punished, but, though the admitted nothing was done (except in the case ot Ah Khan, who was induce.!, to surrender ’and was detained at Sipahsalar’s own house), nor would my Russian co league put any pressure on the Cabinet with this object. The truth is that Persian I Ministers do not care to make enemies, never knowing what the next turn of the wheel may bring, while brigands, both political and highway, nearly always have fripnds in the entourage of influential people of both sides. friends n ^ conduct of dome stic affairs was little better than a nightmare of surprises, we have much less to complain of in the domain of foreign nohties not indeed that his Excellency showed more intelligence in regard to them, but me'rely because they have but little interest for him (except when he saw an opportunity of personal gain), and he was content to observe a blind obedience to behests and Akbar Mirza’s guidance. My Russian colleague, in discussing the Teen tu' 3e of events in this country has often lamented our failure to take advantage of this disposition on the part of the late Ministry, and he is wont to [2628 d—2]2 describe the period of Sipahsalar’s Government as “five months of wasted opportunity ’ ^ ^ opportunity was well recognised by M. de Btter himself, who earlv set to work to obtain the agreement of the Persian Government to the formation of a Afixed Financial Commission to supervise the expenditure of the,- accumalations accruing to the Persian Government from the retroactive force of the “Moratorium ” agreement, which he thought would be a useful first step towards the establishment of a much wider measure of financial control. Although I had not much belief in the utility of the Commission from this latter point ot view, it was obviously of advantage to prevent the waste of the considerable sum 220,000/., which the two Governments were placing at the disposal of the Persian Government, and gave my colleague every support, with the result that an agreement, was leached on the 29th April. 3 But, with the more important negotiations for an agreement that would set our future relations with Persia on a new and prac tical basis, no pi ogress was made. M. de Etter wished to initiate discussion on the lines of the counter project for an alliance d trois drawn up by us for presentation to Barman Parma, but with such considerable modifications as the change of situation owing to General Baratof’s successful operations seemed to demand. The Pussian Government, however, at once discarded the idea of alliance and proceeded to lop off one by one all the contemplated concessions to Persia, such as revision of the Treaty of Turkmanchai and of the customs tariff, an agreement as to possession of landed property by foreigners, protection of Persians by foreign Powers, &amp;c., until the projected agreement was practically-reduced to three points only— 1. Pormation of forces under British and Russian instructors in the south and north respectively for the preservation of order. 2. Financial control. 3. Subsidy during the war. Even this result was not achieved without the most regrettable delays on the part of the Russian Foreign Office and of the General Staff, which latter took nearly a month to make up its mind to raise the proposed maximum numbers of the Cossack brigade from the 10,000 considered sufficient by the Commandant here to 11,000 while the telegram finally authorising M. de Etter to sign and present the first note of the 3rd August bore date eight days before that of its receipt. In fact, the Russian Government behaved as if the position here was one of absolute security, guaranteeing us unlimited time for protracted negotiations, and so little did they concern themselves about expediting the conclusion of the agreement* that for some weeks their main preoccupation appears to have been to take advantage of the pretext offered by their difficulties in financing their troops in Persia, owing to the fall in the rouble exchange, in order to secure some not very considerable advantages for the Banque d’Escompte at the expense of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Meantime the Russian troops were suffering considerable losses from sickness, very feu reliefs were being sent to General Baratof, and so far as I understand little notice was taken of the repeated warnings sent to Petrograd by the Russian Minister as to t ie instability of the position here, and the necessity of consolidating it. eneia aratof s forces were indeed no longer adequate to carry out the duties laid on , e . ra ’ Y- 1 . c . cora P r ised, it must not be forgotten, not merely the military duty of guan ing nen immense lines of communications and maintaining garrisons in Ispahan, as an, um, Kenej, oultanabad, Hamadan, and Burujird, but also to a certain x en , lie wor’ hitherto done by the gendarmerie of guarding the main arteries of . an . y n P 0Sln g respect on the tribes. The Persian Government had no force v • 0V f l . , 118 u .

The next safeguard, but a much frailer one, was the Conclusion as speedily as possible of the agreement providing for forces organised by British and Russian officers, but here again Petrograd allowed valuable time to be ' .lost, and when at the eleventh hour the question was taken up, it was linked with the complicated question of financial control, with the result that the latter has been settled hastily in a form which is sure to give rise to difficulties in the future. Considered in this way, M. de Etter’s strictures on wasted opportunities seem well founded. In the sequel, as you are well aware, General Baratof suddenly found himself attacked by largely superior forces, and was compelled to beat a precipitate retreat, first to beyond Kermanshah, and later as far as the Sultan Bulagh pass, 50 miles north of Hamadan, where, had the Turks attacked him at once, as he confessed himself, he would have had no course but to withdraw again. The news of* the Russian retreat, with the usual grossly exaggerated accounts of their losses, and the knowledge of General Baratof’s perilous position, naturally encouraged all the hostile elements in Tehran to raise their heads again, and the usual intrigues against the Cabinet were redoubled. I myself was repeatedly sounded as to whether I did not think a chang*e from the unpopular and corrupt Government of Sipahsalar to another, which, while free from the vices of the “ Russian Cabinet, ’ would by its British complexion equally ensure the common interests of the two Powers. I, of course, absolutely rejected these suggestions, but it was clear that the days of Sipahsalar’s Cabinet were numbered. Under the pressure of these circumstances, the Russian Government at length saw the need of expediting the conclusion of the agreement, and M. de Etter received, though in a not very definite shape, the requisite authority to push the negotiations to a conclusion. Except for preparing tlie first draft of the joint note, I have had myself little to do with the negotiations—if, indeed, such a term can properly be applied to proceedings which were really little more than a series of announcements by my Russian colleague to the Persian Government that this or that concession, which the two Powers had been earlier prepared to accord, was now to be struck out. There was nothing for me to do except to obtain for mysell a repetition of the assurances given to my colleague that the Persian GoA^ernment accepted these successive amputations without demur. Eventually, however, the joint note was presented, and a satisfactory reply was received two days later. I must confess that, even after Saram-ed-Dowleh had brought me the Persian text of the proposed answer, I could scarcely bring myself to believe that the Cabinet would authorise its signature. The agreement itself is virtually one for the administratif c partition of the country, and the consideration given for this tremendous concession is no more than a monthly sibsidy of 200,000 tomans lor the duration of the wai. It seemed to me incredible that the Cabinet, with all its subserviency, could find the courage to execute so unpopular an instrument, when the military position, which was its only real support, wns fast crumbling away, and when the Alinisters must u cognise that w ; hen that support failed them they would be exposed to the resmtment of the nation. The incredible, however, came to pass; the exchange of no,es took place, and five days later the Shah sent for bipahsalar and informed him that he had selected Vosugh-ed-Dowleh to form a new Cabinet. I have little doubt that the conclusion of the fateful agreement was one of the most potent arguments advanced to persuade the Shah to so unusual an exertion of his anthority. Although I do not think that the return of the Zil-es-Sultan has had any considerable'’effect on the course of political events here, this report would be scarcely complete without some mention of it. The unusual attentions paid to Liis Imperial Highness, both in London and Petrograd, naturally invested his reappearance in Persia with corresponding importance, and with characteristic ingenuity our enemies and those of the Cabinet turned it to advantage by inspiring the Shah with the suspicion that his famous great uncle had been sent here by the two Powers to replace him on the throne. M. de Etter and 1 had the greatest difficulty m persuading His Majesty of the absurdity of such a supposition, and although the audience between the Shah and the Zil-es-Sultan passed off fairly smoothly, there is no doubt that the jealous insinuations of Kamran Mirza against his elder brother have left a strong feelino- of mistrust in His Majesty’s mind of the two Powers and of Akbar Mirza. To the German and other enemy agents wmrking among the Bakhtians the return of the Zil-es-Sultan has of course been a godsend, and by representing us as the causes of his reappearance they have succeeded in rousing the ire of a number of theyounger Khans to such a pi^tyt .eem^ act tlie elder Khans will he a His Imperial Highness’s threatened reappear- »“: S».“»«»&gt;»&gt;. i '»~f s“nsiWe of them recognised that they must how to the mentahle.

A force of Military police to he raised in Southern Persia and Cossack Brigade to he gradually extended in North Persia. Each force eventually to number 11,000 men. The two Governments respectively to place at disposal of Persian Goverment sufficient number oi officers, non-Commissioned officers, doctors, Lc ., for this purpose, and to meet cost of equipment and upkeep of the two forces until end of war at least. In regard to maintenance of these forces after uhe war mixed financial commission '.vill decidL. sources of revenue could he applied for this purpose. 2. The two Governments are ready sympatheticalj^ to consider wishes of Persian Government in regard to taxation of foreigners hut they hold that power Mixed Commission should be extended on lines alreau .■r^TvsS'yv suggestedj suggested hy the latter* If Persian Goverrrnent grant to Comission the extension powers the two Governments would consent to Impose following taxes:- House tax, octroi, trade licenses, excise on native tobacco. Provided however that (a) in the case of assessed taxes such as house tax the foreigner will have right to appeal in case of dissatisfaction with assessment to his Consul; (b) payment of taxes may be enforced only through Consul (group undecypherable); (c) (? no) new tax may be levied on foreigners without assent of the two Powers. In the event of agreement being arrived at on above lines the two Governments will grant monthly subsidy of tomans 200,000 during the war. We propose to annex to note memorandum defining powers which commission should possess»As(? defined) they would give Commission full control over Persian finance, imperial, municipal and provincial and they reserve to British and Prussian members power of veto on all more important matters. Maclean considers them ample. No time limit is fixed for duration of commis sion which depends on agreement of the three Powers. as regards paragraph 1 of Note maximum figuis 01 11,000 men is taken at the desire of Russian staff which also deprecates fixing numbers of officers and Non-commissioned officers.

Owing t 0 constant marching and other causes, Sykes has not yet able to submit comprehensible (?. ive) scheme for policing, Bunder Abbas-Kerman and Bushire-Shiraz roads, which presumably must be first objective. Proposals hitherto received from him, besides being unduly expensive have appearance of being incomplete. Me contemplates a force of 14 British oflicers and about 2,700 gendarmerie of all arms for Bunder Abbas—Kerman road. This would include Kerman garrison, movable column and roads towards Yezd and Bam. In absence of detailed scheme, it is difficult to calculate annual cost of above force with any approach to accuracy, but at lates of pay, Ac. proposed by Svkes, it will be approximately tomans 900,000 or at current rate of exchange Us. 22,50,000 a year. For Shiraz road he estimates that slightly larger force will be required, cost of which may be taken roughly Its. 25,00,000. There will, in addition, be certain initial expenditure. We are consulting Tehran as to rates paid by Russians to Persian Cossacks, and hope to be able to reduce eventual cost. Meanwhile, we have authorised Sykes to proceed with recruiting at rates proposed, but we have warned him as whole scheme is under consideration, there may be subsequent modifica tions as to details. We trust that you will approve our action. W e hope to obtain complete scheme from Sykes when he reaches Shiraz. Owing to absence of data and uncertainty of conditions, it is impossible, at present, to frame Budget expenditure for current year. Sykes has accordingly been authorised to incur expenditure as required against lump sum advances, i s Tt present arranged, cost of police during war and for some months alter will presumably be borne in equal shares by His Majesty s Government an Indian exchequer, but British share of annual contribution of tomans ■24 OOO-OHO to be provided later from Persian sources vide Marling s telegram 360 F.’, dated 2nd June, will go far towards meeting the cost of the scheme.Confidential. to Reference:—Letter r For elan Office J from 3 ^ 1'he Under - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as* presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and is directed by the.

It is in our opinion desirable to adopt a p-eneral principle of div i sion which will out an end to these discussions . Both countries have admittedly a large interest in Persia, and we think that the charges of the Mission and Consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries.' ^ The principle was presumably applied to diplomatic and consular expenditure because there was at first no other charge necessitating a division. From 1890 to 1900 India had contributed a moiety of the Karun subsidy (£2000 p.a.), but,on the recommendation of the Welby Commission, after 1900 the whole subsidy was defrayed from Imperial revenues as a set off to the Bagdad- Basra mail subsidy, paid by India. In 1901 the question of division was revived by the prooosal to grant a loan to the Persian Government. In Sir A. Godley’s letter of 12th November 1901 the following decision was communicated to the Foreign Officei— 'Lord G. Hamilton is aware that in the Report of the Royal Commission on the expenditure of India the principle has been recorded that both Great Britain and India have a large interest in Persia, and that H.M’s. Government have agreed to divide equally the diplomatic cnarges in Persia between the two countries. His Lordship is ready to recognise this principle on the present occasion.' InIn the following year the Secretary of State in S: 5/4/02 ', 1941 / 02 . roi F.O. 2C/X/04 .3261). ,2097/04 Council agreed to guarantee a moiety of a proposed subsidy of £2000 p.a. for 10 years to a Company formed for the purpose of taking over from the Imperial Bank of Persia a concession for roads in 8. Persia, on the condition that the Treasury accepted liability for the other moiety. Sir T. Sanderson had previously written to the effect that Lord Lansdowne would not be disposed to do more towards the undertaking than the counterpart of what the Viceroy and the India Office fejt justified in doing. An irrigation scheme for the Karun valley was considered in 1904, and in October the Foreign Office agreed that the cost of deputing an Engineer from India to report upon it should be equally divided. A proposed advance of £200,000 to the Persian Government in this connection did not materialise,but the Government af India were prepared to provide part of the money on the assumption 'that H.M’s. Government will be prepared to share equally with the Indian Government the liability on account of the capital and interest on the loan.' Their letuer was communicated to the Foreign Office. The question of the extent of India s interest in Persia arose in 1909 in connexion with a proposed Anglo-Bussian advance of £400,000, of which Inoia was expected to contribute £100,000, a moiety of the British Jicero^ share. In the Secretary of State’s telegram of 11th May 1909 the Viceroy was informed that 'As regards any further financial assistance to Persia, India is free from any engagement, and I have made it clear to Foreign Office that, apart from objections on grounds of general Imperial policy to financial and other entanglements in Persia, I cannot admit that Indian interestsf6i j lo F.O. 11/12/09 P.4305. in Persia are of a nature to justify expenditure from Indiaurevenues on schemes for establishing reformed government in Persia. Such schemes involve^only financial risk but danger of international complications, from responsibility for which it is essential that India should be kept entirely free.”; and the following extract from a letter of 11th December to.the Foreign Office is to the same effect:~ 'It will not be easy, for instance, to show what « direct interest India has in the continuance of constitutional rule in Persia, and it will be very easy » and not unreasonable for Indian politicians to ask way ” they should pay for the security in Persia of a ' constitutional system strictly denied to themselves. It ' is true, again, that India is part of the Empire, and ' should take its share in the burdens of the Empire. The ' moment,however, is not a happy one for resoit to tnis line of argument, as Indians are now sharply resenting a ' denial to them of equality of citizenship within the ' Empire by colonial communities not themselves » contributing to its defence. It may be true, indeed, - that order in Persia might help Indian commerce. But ' Lord Morley is not convinced that improvement in the « sphere of Indian trade by means of this kind is assured •• enough to justify the imposition of new burdens upon the « general body of Indians. Nor is he convinced that even ' the conversion of the Persian debt would strike either •• the judgnent or the imagination of the Indian taxpayer as ' a specifically Indian interest. 'While, therefore, he is reluctantly obliged to assume ' responsibility for the loan of£100,000 to which he agreed i n May last, Lord Morley is not prepared to recommend his ' Council to sanction any further advance. Thet ,0. to F.O. 28/7/13 P.1335 'reasury /0 F.O. (0/12/13 f P.66/14 P.3278 The logjfi in question was not,however, required by Persia at the time, and no further advance was made till 1912, in which year the Indian share amounted to £70,000 out of the £100,000 authorised by the Secretary of State in 1909. In 1913, however, India contributed £150,000 towards the advances then made by the British Government for general purposes and for the creation of a gendarmerie force. The position which Lord Morley had assumed in 1909 was thus not maintained in practice by this Office. During 1913 the reconstruction of the Arabistan telegraph line was undertaken. The Treasury, who were requested to share the proportion of the cost to be borne by H.M f s Government,^accepted the charge but observed that they would,for reasons stated, have felt justified in declining to accept any further liability than they had already accepted in respect of the Arabistan lines, or at the least in limiting the British contribution to a smaller amount than a moiety of the anticipated expenditure. They felt hesitation however in adopting the latter course, 'as it would involve the abandonment oi 'what is known as the half and half principle xor 'expenditure which falls to be borne by ^hio country and 'India'. On this the Financial Department observed that the Treasury would have had considerable justification had they chosen to take the extreme step - for refusing to accept any liability beyond what they had undertaken in 1908, and this without impairing the half and half principle. In the circumstances their acceptance of the proposals of the India Office was a matter for congratulation In 1913 also it was arranged that the cost of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission should be equally divided. The Foreign Office, in addressing the Treasury on 3th August 1913 stated that the expenditure involved in previous&gt;oLDespatch 12/9/lS. o F*0# 5/6/14. IP.2017) . previous Commissions had 'been, in respect of the British portion of the work, entirely defrayed from Imperial funds. In view however of recent developments, (i.e. the increased interest which India now has in the districts adjoining the head of the Persian Gulf), it was proposed to ask the Government of India to bear half the expenditure. This proposal was*approved by the Secretary of State in Council. A proposal to lease certain islands from the Persian Government was under consideration in 1914. The Secretary of State informed the Foreign Office, on 5th June, of his readiness to advise his Council to admit half the annual rent, estimated to be between £12,000 and £50,000, as a charge on Indian revenues. Since the outbreak of war there have been no developments, and the proposal has therefore not been submitted to Council. (Intld.) 20th June 1916.Sir T. Holdemess, With reference to your Minute beJ.ow, I cannot find that the particular point raised by Mr. Hewmarch has ever formed the subject of a definite ruling by Council. I attach a note by Mr, Garrett giving a history of the 'half and half' arrangement, its genesis, ^isctical application, kc., which leaves, I venture to think, i little doubt (1) that the arrangement was intended to apply to all Persian expenditure, not merely to that connected with diplomatic and consular establishments; and (2) that, whatever the original intention, we are too far committed by our action in the past, to press on the * Treasury, with any hope of success, the narrower view of our commitments in Persia. v . ^ (ML ptl* -Ufa fcL 'X K^. u CnA' sj * Sv^^i eXjJci ^^ &lt;K.

As regards Military Police we agree Marling should negotiate with Persian Government on lines proposed. It is impossible at this stage to submit detailed scheme for South Persia Military Police but® 10,000 men with necessary complement of British officers might be taken as the limit up to which we propose eventually to work. Immediate desideratum is of course to organise force for restoration of order on two main southern trade routes namely Bunder Abbas - propose to Kerman and Bushire - Shiraz and we/ask Sykes to prepare interim scheme for this purpose. As regards grant of subsidy of 266,000 tomans a month for period of war we are not in a position to advise but if His Majesty's Government are satisfied as to necessity of this subsidy for maintenance of friendly and effective Persian Government we are prepared to pay usual share. As regards mixed Commission we again find it difficult to express an opinion but will welcome arrangement if it secures effective control over Persian finances in which we are so considerably interested.

Until I learn whether Hussian Government approve your Hussian colleague's counter-draft in your telegram ' \ ko. 66 (of 27th January) and agree to amend articles 2 and V • o. 7 thereof, it is difficult for me to offer .definite ob servations on the subject. Should Russian Government concur in above-mentioned draft, I would wish you to concert with your Russian colleague in elaborating a definite counter-draft for com- munication to Persian Government. In this connexion you should bear in mind following points which' refer to Articles as numbered in Monsieur de Etter ! s draft. Article 1. Should preferably be for more than one year and contain suggestions made by India Office in that portlonof my telegram No.51 (of 29th January) dealing with Article 1. His Majesty's Government think that it will probably prove necessary to subsidise Persian Government until such time as revenue shall be forthcoming from other sources. Ar ticle 2. Russian counter-draft acarcely covers ground as it does not empower His Majesty's Government to punish Khans and Persian Prime Minister's undertaking oflast year would not protect His Majesty’s Government, from charges of internal interference and unfriendly action should they eventually decide on taking punitive measures themselves* If undertaking to leave liberty of action to His Majesty’s Government cannot figure in proposed treaty, India Office would suggest its inclusion in separate agreement. If however you yourself are satisfied that our freedom of action is assured, I will not press point. .. It appears doubtful whether Mixed Commission enjoying no more definite powers than those specified in Article 7 of Russian Minister's draft could secure result contem plated in Article 2. Difficulty might be met by omission from Article 2 of all words from 'which is' to word 'south' and by substituting therefor a sentence giving to Mixed Commission a controlling power over constitution of the force, while Article 7 should provide for control of Military subventions. Art icle 8 . Control of expenditure of general subsidy is I recognise impracticable, but if possible, military expenditure should be under control of British and Hu ssian officers emp1 cy e d.

Nothing was said about indemnity, but I consider it as accepted tacitly.

While there has not (group unde cypher able) necessity for creating an armed force in Persia Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks that the formation of an army corps of 50,000 men could not be realized if only because of the impossibility cf supply ing the necessary amount of arms and ammunition, and the re quired number of instructors. At the most the Russian Government could contribute (?one) Cossack Brigade by, perhaps, incorporating in it a portion of the present gendarmerie. The British Government might, if it thought it necessary,form a similar corps in south Persia under the orders of British officers. Finally if Far man Farma succeeded in winning over the Western tribes, the two Governments might take over their cost in proportion •that bnese tribes joined Russian or British forces.

We have no information as to other armament. Art. 3. We think can be agreed to. Shah’s nominee, if net agreeable to us, would be a cypher. Art. 4. Persian obligations should be expressed in wider terms, so as, for instance, to include furnishing supplies to us at reasonable prices. Protection of Persia and maintenance of Kajars in person of the Shah and his descendants can be conceded. Art. 5. Admissible, provided that moment of evacuation of Persia by our troops is fixed by 7 common consent. Art. 6 . Russian Minister would like toBritain and Russia will abstain from all measures contrary to independence and territorial integrity of Persia, such as interference in her internal affairs, con clusion of public or private pacts with tribal chiefs, &amp;c., and any such existing conventions are hereby annulled. Art. 7. Engagements of 24th De cember, 1911, and 20th March, 1912, taken by Persia in consequence of Russian ultimatum of 29th November, 1911, and of Anglo-Russian demands of 18th February, 1912 are cancelled.- Nor will the two Powers in future con clude any agreement with each other or with other Powers such as infringe Persian independence, and will oppose such an attempt on the part of any other Power. shelve the whole question by reserving it for later discussion. I have so 1 ttle belief in the value of agreements wt;h tribal chiefs that I should see no oh ection to making concessions as regards future, bi^ I think it most unlikely that Persiai? Government will seriously press article, seeing that both Farman Farma and Sipahdar enjoy foreign protection, and probably we could negative proposal if so desired. In any case, our arrangements with Sheikh of Mohammerah must be upheld. Art. 7. Two points involved are :— (A.) Obligation to consult to the two Powers respecting appointment of foreign adviser's, &amp;c. (B.) Persian recognition of 1907 Con vention. Russian Minister considers refusal of his Government to admit concessions on both points final, but suggests that this question also might be reserved for sub sequent discussion. I submit, however, that on both con cessions can be made quite safely ; in fact, as to (A), although agreement is in force since December 1911, we have never yet made use of it, and in spite of rt Persian Government has on many occasions taken foreigners into its service without con sulting us. Posts so filled, it is true, of minor importance, but w r e have never, as far as I am aware, been officially consulted, though we may have been occasionally unofficially sounded; in any case, it will always be quite feasible for the two Go vernments to negative any appointment disagreeable to them. (B) seems^ of even less importance if His Majesty’s Government intends, as I understand, to insist, if Cossack brigade is to be so expanded as to provide ade quately for maintenance of order in the north of Persia, similar force under British instructors shall be created in Southern Persia. Arrangement of this kind will be more practically effective in defining sphere of influence than any Persian recognition of 1907 Convention. Jt is clear that Russia regards question of alliance from different standpoint from ourselves. With their troops in North Persia in sufficient numbers, as they apparently believe, to make situation safe as regards their own interests, they attach far less importance to it than we do, and they are consequently inclined less to make concessions, even if apparent rather than real, than to exact t rem.

I pointed out that His Majesty's Government might desire alliance but find price required by Persia (?excessive omitted) and that practical thing was for him to let me know confidentially proposed terms. On my under taking to represent that I had obtained my knowledge by private means, N.gave following outline.
