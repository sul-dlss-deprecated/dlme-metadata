Under the terms of the agreement between the Shaikh of SHARJAH and His Majesty’s Government the Shaikh accepts full responsibility for the protection of the Air Station so far as his dependants, relations and subjects are concerned and for their protection as far as possible against marauders from outside his jurisdiction. He has agreed to provide guards who are equipped with service rifles# These guards are untrained, poorly paid, but have a certain prestige owing to being equipped and paid from British sources# 2. The Air Station at SHARJAH may be threatened by forces with which the Shaikh or the guard cannot deal# If so, His Majesty’s Government is committed to under take the necessary measures to guarantee the security of the Air Station# 3 . An alarm signal may be sdnt from SHARJAH for any of the reasons which are detailed below. (i) Trouble with the guards themselves# (ii) Internal disturbance in SHARJAH. (iii) a raid on the Air Station by a few irresponsible Arabs, who are after loot, particularly rifles and ammunition, which are valuable commodities on the TRUCIAL COAST# (iv) Local strife between the Shaikh of SHARJAH and some of his neighbours. It is possible that such local trouble may lead to an attack on the Air Station* In any case, the security of the Air Station may be threatened# (v) Attack, or threat of attack, on a considerable scale by Bedouin# /AIM,4. The aim is to maintain the security of the Air Station* FACTORS AFFECTING THE ATTAINMENT OP THE- AIM* Defence Forces at SHARJAH. 5. The Imperial Airways Staff at SHARJAH normally consists of a British Superintendent and one British Engineer* The remainder of the Staff consists of Indians and Arabs. The Superintendent has been allotted 6 rifles and ammunition* 6. The Shaikh’s guard comprises 37 men all equipped with service rifles, but as stated in paragraph 1 the efficiency of the guards is low. Position of Air Station, 7. The Air Station is situated in such a position that it can be covered by fire from a sloop off SHARJAH, approximate range 2,700 yards* Defences at SHARJAH* 8. The walls of the rest house are high enough and strong enough to offer a considerable obstacle to anything but a well organised attacking force, and the gate to the rest house also cannot be forced easily* A searchlight is also available. Therefore, it may be assumed that the rest house could serve as a fort which could cover the whole landing ground from attack, provided that information is received in time and the necessary personnel and equipment are available* Strength of possible attacking force * 9. As explained in paragraph 3, attacks may come from neighbouring Shaikhs. As an example, the Shaikh of DIBAI keeps a personal escort of approximately 150 armed men and the Shaikh of AJMAN keeps a personal escort of approximately 15 armed men* In addition, these Shaikhs can normally depend on the support of the adult male population of their towns and to a lesser extent on that of their Bedouin allies, many of whom, no doubt, are in possession of rifles. No accurate information can be given of the strength of attack from NEJD* It will be seen that should DIBAI or AJMAN, or a combination of both, force home an attack on the Air Station, the defence personnel is inadequate to deal with the situation for long without reinforcements. //e. m® »-'A. ^ ■ F J lo.

Government Forces available for defence of SHARJAH consist of (i) Bomber aircraft. (ii) Bomber Transport aircraft, (iii) Flying Boats. (ivj H.M. Sloops. Time and Space. 11. SHARJAH is 790 miles from the aircraft bases at BASRAH and SHAIBAH. Aircraft can arrive at SHARJAH within 24 hours of the receipt of a distress signal. The time taken by H.M. Sloops to arrive at SHARJAH is dependent on the position of the sloops at the time. 12. It is important that, if trouble occurs, help should be sdnt as rapidly as possible. Aircraft offer the best means of giving quickest help, ml ess a sloop is in the immediate vicinity. Intelligence. 13. The difficulty of foreseeing the development of trouble either on the TRITCIAL COAST or inland is one of the most important factors in the situation. Provided warning can be given in time, it is easy to arrange for adequate protection of SHARJAH Air Station. However, without timely and accurate information of the situation it is possible that the first warning of attack might be jv a signal from the Air Station. The importance of having |/ an Intelligence Officer in the GULF who can keep in touch with the local situation and co-operate with the Political and Service units in the GULF should be H considered in the near future* CQURSaS OPEN TO THB HNMY. The only course which will seriously threaten security of SHARJAH Air Station is one which leads to capture of the fort by hostile elements. The fort fall owing to 14. the thfi (i) a ruse, such as the bribing of the guards, or a surprise attack at night when the gate may be open during a landing by Imperial Airways aircraft, or (ii) by a H set piece' attack on the fort. Persistent sniping, although inconvenient, cannot be regarded as a serious threat and could be checked by holding the Chiefs concerned responsible.15. The former course is the one most likely to be adopted and can only be adequately safeguarded against by an efficient intelligence service backed up by capable guards. COURSES OPEN TO US. 16. The courses open to us are To send aircraft to SHARJAH. 17. This course has the advantage that it will also enable accurate information of the situation to be obtained rapidly. To send a sloop to SHARJAH to make a demonstration and. if necessary, to take action by gun fire or a landing party . 18. This course may take some time to carry out if a sloop is not in the vicinity and difficulties may be encountered in obtaining accurate information of the situation prevailing should communication break down. To send aircraft and sloops to SHARJAH to work in co-operation . 19. This course will provide the maximum of security to the Air Station in the event of serious trouble* OUR BEST COURSE OF ACTION. 20. It is difficult to lay down definitely what is the best course of the three outlined above, since it is obviously dependent on the situation and the position of H.M. Sloops in the OULF at the time. 21. Owing to the importance of the time factor and the lack of reliable intelligence the best course is that which gives help and provides information in the shortest possible time. Unless, therefore, a sloop is actually in the vicinity when trouble occurs, the best course will be to send aircraft. 22. The co-operation of both Services will auto matically be adopted if the scale of attack justifies it. PLAN OF ACTION. Action by Superintendent, SHARJAH Air Station. 23. In the event of attack or threat of attack the Superintendent, after consultation with the Residency Agent if he is at SHARJAH, will signal R.P. G. repeating S.N.O.P.G. , P.A. BAHREIN and A.H.Q. giving as much information as possible.

Action by tbe Superintendent, SHARJAH Air Station. In the event of a situation developing at SHARJAH which leads the Superintendent to suppose that the security of the Air Station may be threatened, he is to take the following action : (i) If the Residency Agent is available he should forward latter’s report by telegram as in (i) of Appendix II. If he adds comments he should differentiate quite clearly in his telegrams between these comments and what are the messages from the Residency Agent. Thus} following from Residency Agent begins} ..ends. (ii) If the Residency Agent is not available the Superintendent should say so in his first telegram and report what information he can gather under heads (i) (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Appendix II. When the Residency Agent returns to SHARJAH the Superintendent should continue to send information as in (i) above. (iii) Ensure that food and water supplies for the Air Station are built up to the maximum, that the door of the Port is locked and that he holds the key (iv) In the absence of Imperial Airways aircraft issue rifles and ammunition to such members of his staff as he considers reliable, or if an Imperial Airways aircraft is present, issue rifles to such passengers who seem to be capable of using them. (y) If satisfied with their loyalty, arrange sentry posts on the walls inside the Port from the Sheikh’s guard. (vi) Make sure that the Aldis Lamp for visual signalling to H.M. Sloops and aircraft is serviceable and available for use. vii) Send situation report by W/T each evening to tj Hon’ble Political Resident in the PERSIAN GULP Political Agent, BAHREIN, Air Headquarters, HI] and the Senior Naval Officer in the PERSIAN GULP. himself \APPENDIX II APPRECIATION OP THE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OP DISTURBANCE AT SHARJAH• Action by the Residency Agent, SHARJAH* The following instructions have been given to the Residency Agent by the Political Resident* In the event of a situation developing at SHARJAH which leads the Residency Agent to suppose that the security of the Air Station may be threatened, he is to take the following actions (i) He will immediately inform the Station Superintendent SHARJAH Air Station, and through him despatch a telegram to the Political Resident, the Political Agent, BAHREIN, Air Headquarters, HINAIDI, and the Senior Naval Officer in the PERSIAN GULP, giving as much information as possible regarding: (a) The leader of any hostile elements whose presence is suspected. (b) The composition of the hostile elements. (c) Whether the threat is likely to develop at once, or, if not, when. (d) An estimate of the feeling of the local guards. (ii) He will continue to keep the above officials informed by telegram as to how the situation is developing. (iii) He will give all possible assistance to the Superintendent and to all officers - Naval and Royal Air Force, who may arrive. NOTE : The above instructions apply if the Residency Agent is present in SHARJAH when danger to the Air Station threatens. If he is absent from SHARJAH on tour he will return there immediately he hears that a dangerous situation is developing, and inform all concerned by telegram through the Superintendent that he has returned.P.Z.557/35.

The Rest House guards sympathised with the Bedouins and were slack in their duties. Adequate protection of the Rest House was urgently sought. On reference to the Residency Agent, it transpired that there had been some small trouble/trouble but the report was exaggerated by the Station Superintendent, who seems somewhat nervous. The matter had already been settled and the guard dealt with. The Hon.the Political Resident, however, approved of a suggestion from the Air Officer Commanding 'Iraq Command that a flight of four ■ Wapitis should proceed to Sharjah as a demonstration. This was carried out on 19th July.

They would be of no use whatever if they were. It was only proposed that they should, if possible, be segregated from the Europeans. This may, or may not, be possible.

In the mean time, however, though I am grateful to Imperial Airways for keeping me informed, I must really protest at their Station Superintendent sending in to them political reports - for that’s what his communication amounts to, especially without my knowledge. f Hie Station Superintendent is a business Manager, not a Political Agent, and the last thing we want, and 1 imagine that the Company wants, is that he should tend in any way to mix himself up with local political affairs. The Company’s officials in London are in no position, of course, to gauge the correct significance of any political reports which their Station Superintendent sends them, and can only draw wrong conclusions from such reports - as they have done on this occasion. Machine guns may or may not be necessary ior the Shargah Rest House, hut they are aertainly not so because a few individuals are kidnapped now and then by Bedouin. This does happen occasionally of course along the/ G * Walton, Esquire, C.B., M.C., ^he India Office, Lon don.- 2 - the ^rucial Coast, and if the relatives cannot effect the release of the captives, they apply to the Residency Agent ,i who, if he cannot take any action on his own, reports to the Resident. ICach rucial Coast Shaikh is bound by treatv to put down Slave m rading in his territory, and each Shaikh has a nominal though actually very slight control over the Bedouin of his hinterland. The Resident, therefore, takes up the case with the Shaikh concerned, and endeavours by bringing pressure to bear on him to get the captives released. In this he generally succeeds, though it naturally takes a long time. 2 . All this, however, has nothing to do with the Station Superintendent as business representative of his Company, nor with the security of the Rest House- Janes, the Station Superintendent at Shargah, is quite a good fellow, (I have met him a couple of times), and in sending his political reports has presumably merely been carrying out the instructions of his Company. But I wish to make a very strong suggestion that he confines his reports to his Company in fhture to matters for which his Company is responsible - i.e. business and business only* I am, however, always glad to get informa tion from any source whatsoever, and if Janes has political reports to make they should be addressed to roe, or rather to the Political Agent, Bahrain, who now has immediate charge of the ^rucial Coast, (vide paragraph 1 of my despatch No. ^Ob-S, dated the 23rd June 19 33, to the Government of India, copy forwarded to the Secretary of State for India under my printed letter Ho*706-S of same date).

I reel/ that the presence of machine guns, say one on each of the towers in the fort, would quickly become known, and would deter the unruly element from taking liberties at or near the fort, and I would liks to ask your advice in regard to the supply of these guns and ammunition and their employment • My own view is that thej should not be put in the hando of the Shaikh and his guard, but should constitute a system of reserve defence for opeiation by our own people. If it is decided that tlese guns are to be supplied then I would recorrmend that our Station Superintendent and Ground Engineer should be sent to Basra for a short course in the handling of these guns and their maintenance, and arrangements should also be made tlat the locks are always kept in a safe lock-up with ehthe cey in the possession of our P eo Ple# This can of course easily be arranged if the policy is agreed.

EX^RAC' EROM REPORT BY THE STA^XOTJ SHARGAH. 1456 1 STrptQ:5 , 5iijiBji4 ■ L ^ » A certain amount of alarm prevails amongst the inhabitants of Shargah and Dehai , caused by small parties of Bedouins kidnapping children and youths with the intention of selling them as slaves. Only yesterday two young men were carried off at the wells about two miles from here. 'Rhere have also been three cases recently, when they have fe*en gone to the extent of murder, when they have come across men too old to carry off. Though appeals have been made to the Shai Jdi of ohaxgah, he ooes not appear to do anything to prevent these raids; and it is said he does not care, as most of the people murdered or captured are either Persian subjects or MeTcranis. It is even rumoured that he has said that he has ^i ven Tbhis country to the British, and it is their duty to take action.-r 3 f erenee 3.31841. ; / 1 P.Z. 3867 5 97) AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, W.C.2. dear Laithwaite, We have had a letter from Imperial Airways suggesting that the British white personnel at Sharjah 1st July, 1933. f U- y t should have in their possession 2 or 3 machine guns (lewis guns) for use * by them should it ever become necessary, in the last resort , to defend the rest-house itself from assault. This, of course, presupposes that the guard is slain, has gone over to the rebels, or is otherwise ineffective. On the assumption that these guns would be under the sole care of British white personnel which would practically eliminate the chance of their falling into unauthorised hands, and that these men could be trained in' their use, we saw no serious objjootion to the proposal, because it is evident that the white personnel bottled up in the fort, in the event of its being invested, would need some weapon with which to defend themselves.

Laithwaite, Ssq* X India Office, S.W. 1. oV ‘ENCLOSURE IN WteKLY 6 tary, political an» 0FF!*EWe consulted Burnett in Iraq and we have just had his reply which is to the effect that he does not recommend machine guns, owing to the impossibility of the white personnel being able to keep in practice, and, of course, a machine gun which cannot be handled in an however, that the British personnel, i*e. the Station Superintendent and the Ground Engineer, should be issued with a rifle apiece, together with sufficient ammunition. With this suggestion we are in agreement and hope that neither the India Office nor the other interested Departments will see aay objection to this course. that at the same time they wrote to us they also wrote to Eowle putting forward this suggestion, so no doubt you I am sending copies of this letter to Parkinson, Moore, Rendel, Murray and Grieve. emergency is of no use to anyone.

Weighed from Umm a l Quawain at 0600, 19th November and proceeded to Al Ajman, and after the usual exchange of calls, on to Sharjah. The Sheikh of Al Ajman was saluted wit! three guns on leavingy At Sharjah I returned the Sheikh’s call of my previous visit which was still outstanding. Also handed over to the Residency Agent the sum of 12,080 Rupees in accordance with your signalled instructions, for use in connection with the rest house. The ship then weighed and proceeded to Dabai, arriving there at 1530. The Sheikh received a salute of five guns and his brother of one on leaving. After the calls were over, the Residency Agent - Khan Bahadur Isa, O.B.E., embarked for passage to Abu Dhabi, and the ship sailed at 2200 arriving at 0715 the following morning. 6 . After the Agent had disembarked, the Sheikh called on me and received his salute of five guns. In accordance with your verbal instructions, I conveyed a guarded warning to the Sheikh not to concern himself with Air Route matters. Although carefully worded the warning brought forth a storm of protest that there was no-one in all Arabia so delighted with the Air facilities at Sharjah as his people of Abu Dhabi. This I took with a grain of salt. However, I said that in that case all was very well. x x x xp.z. 1815 / 1933 . $ Kxtraot from a report of proceedings of the Gommander- m-Ghief, East Indies. 1 . l ^th - l 6 th December, 19^2 . 50. - 'Hawkins' arrived at Sharjah at 1100 on Ipth Hecemoer, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf came onboard to be present when the local Arabs paid their calls on the Commander-in-Chief. 51 . - He was accompanied by Sheikh Isa, the Resident Agent on the Crucial Coast, Half Persian, half Arab, he is the official spokesman for British Political affairs on the frucial Coast, and has undoubtedly a considerable influence among the Sheikhs. He is a big man and a wall-eye adds a somewhat crafty expression to his face, and though genial in manner the impression he creates is that he service and loyalty are dependent on the manner in which he is reim bursed . 52. - At noon the Sheikh of Sharjah accompanied by at least 20 of his relations called on the Commander-in- Chief . He is a short stocky man and carries himself with dignity. At first his manner was aloof and even appeared surly, but it is probable that this was largely shyness. Since he received a handsome reward for granting a concession to the Imperial Airways at Sharjah he has followed the old adage 'that an Arab’s figure depends on his purse,' and is becoming gross. 53**' The Commander-in-Chief landed in the afternoon, accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and Staff Officers, to pay a visit to the Imperial Airways landing ground. At/&amp; At present the only accommodation arailable i s under canyas and it appears that the new Rest House, which is being built under the responsibility of the Sheikh of Sharjah, will not be complete for some time. The Rest House is being constructed in the form of a square, with all windows and doors facing inwards to provide safety against the possible unwelcome attention of marauding Bedouins. The area, except for the actual landing ground, Is enclosed by a barbed wire fence. The armed guard provided under the agreement by the Sheikh of Sharjah are carrying out their duties satisfactorily and there have been no incidents so far. 54-“ following this visit the Commander-in- chief returned the calls of the Cheikh of Sharjah and the Political Agent. The former, after the usual formalities in his Guest Room, provided an equestrian display of trick riding. It was rather disappointing as the horses were ^ in such poor condition, but the Sheikh himself was well mounted and is a superb horseman. 55*” The slow mail now calls regularly at charjah and there seems no doubt that the Sheikh is well pleased with his closer connection with British interests and ohe increased prosperity they bring to his people; but at tie same time he is uneasy over the possible repercussions from other Sheikhs on the Trucial Coast who are now jealous of his good fortune. x X XiggQjjHQMES ON THE ARABIA COAST 0 Notes of a Meeting held on the 25th April, 1933 0 in Room 24, Gwydyr House at 3 p o m 0 Present:= Colonel Shelmerdine ) (In the Chair) ) Mr 0 Bertrauio ) Colonel Turner 0 Mr a Buricett, } W/C 0 McClaughryo j S/Ldr, Kerby, » F/Lt 0 Duncan 0 ) Mr n AndrewSo | Air Ministryo Mr o Laithwaite 0 Mr 0 Dihdiiio Mr n Crombie 0 ) ) India Office 0 ) Colonel Fowle {Political Resident, Persian Gulf) 0 Mr 0 Rendsi 0 ) NoreIgn Mr 0 Johnston 0 ) 0ffice o - Colonel..

The first westbound Imperial Airways machine 'Hanno' arrived at Sharjah from Gwadar at about 1600 on 5 th October. She had four passengers, but was loaded to full capacity with cargo and spare parts. Her arrival caused but little excitement, but after she was safely berthed in the barbed wire enclosure, the Sheikh and a crowd of people from the town came to admire her. Captain Horsey, pilot of the machine, reported that he had had an excellent trip and had no difficulty at all in landing. The arrangements for berthing the machine and refuelling worked smoothly, and the station guards seem to know what is required of them. 14* The sheikh of Sharjah has complained that he is losing money on account of the fact that work on the rest house is proceeding so slowly. H$i/ complaint was referred to the Political Resident. Apparently work is held up because cement is not available. Certain temporary buildings have been completed or are nearing completion but the rest house itself has not been started. The foundations have been dug out and cemented and adequate deferc e posts have been erected, besides barbed wire enclosures for aircraft and rest house. 15* The passengers are being housed for the present in tents, which are well furnished and are comfortable. Mr. White of Shaibsh aerodrome is in temporary charge of the company T s ill erests and no one could complain of the arrangements made by him under the circumstances. 16. The wireless installation is in full working order. Captain Mackay does not anticipate that the Rest House can be completed under six months. 17 . On 6th October, rT Hanno ? ’ proceeded on her voyage and landed at Manama h, the aerodrome at Bahrain, where she sank two feet into the ground. Apparently there is a layer of soft stratum under a thin hard surface. Six hours were spent in trying to take off. . Finally it was possible to move her to a hard patch of road near by where she remained for the night. She took off, light, from this position, and flew to Muharraq, where passengers and cargo were re-embarked. She then proceeded on her voyage. 18. The East bound aircraft n Hannibal n was diverted to land at Muharraq. She proceeded after refuelling to Sharjah and arrived there on Jth October. Air Commodore C.L.

We have hitherto proceeded on the assumption that the ^rab Air Route would, not cross the Musandim Peninsula but would round its tip* The Admiralty have shared this view, and have intimated demi-officially that their concurrence in the transfer of the route proceeded on the assumption that there would be no crossing of the reninsula. Imperial nirways ana the xxir Ministry now, however, represent strongly that it is j- 1 desirable that they should be given permission to cross the Peninsula, not only because of the saving of time and expense involved, but because difficulties might be experienced with unfavourable winds if they were required to round the tip. 2. The main objections to flights across the Peninsula are political - the danger uhcLt, in the event of &amp; crash or of a forced landing in tne hinterland, which is not amenable to our control 01 to that of the Sultan of Muscat, we might have considerable difficulty with tne local Bedouin. This is more particularly the case since Imperial Airways will be carrying not merely British subjects but foreign passengers also and we might find ourselves involved in international difficulties in tne event of an accident involving foreign passengers | wnom we were unable to ao much to help. But the Air Ministry, at the meeting to-day, stated that m the event/Lr (?&gt; ^ A ' 5 *M*r A event of i/tt^Ras-al-KhaimahiDitba crossIntl^belng j approved they could undertake that there would he no risk of a forced landing in the hinterland, since 6 CL. iASht+ic*- w ^5' PtcA^, /OfVM. ^ a-vo. the machines would he flying at such a height and have engines of such a power that they could easily get away to Shargah and Jask, or,(if and uhen we secure an emergency landing ground there) to Kalha. They were anxious, in agreeing to Ifes-al-Khaimah: Dihha,to he allowed to reopen the question at a later date in the light of experience, for they thought that when a eroplane flights had become more familiar in this area it might he possible to allow them to fly direct from Kalha to Shargah. 3. Private correspondence with the Political Resident goes to suggest that Colonel Fowle would he | prepared to run the risk of a Shargah-Kalba flight even now, hut it seems preferable to go more slowly and in the first place to accept the present Air Ministry proposal of Ras-al~Khaimah:Dibba. It is perhaps hardly necessary to consult the Government of India and the Resident, hut as the general question is one o± some political importance it may he thought desirable to do so and a draft for this purpose is attached.Draft Paper* l political Department.

(a) we seem to have got over possible difficulties about installing a wireless set at Shargah; (b) Paragraph 4. Colonel Fowle's appreciation of the present position of the Sheikh and O'f the difficulties he is not unlikely to have with his brother Rulers is interesting. If difficulty does arise and a serious attack (or, indeed, any attack) develops on the rest house, there will presumably be no objection to 'a few shells from a sloop' if a sloop happens to be available, being dropped among the assailants, and it will be seen that the Naval/Naval Commander-in-Chief das deen asked dy the 3 .N.O. for authority to take prompt action in the case of eventualities. But, as the Resident points out, , :u any arises, is much more likely to de in the form of sniping, which will de distinctly more difficult to deal with than a definite attack* As he says, the course of action to de taken in the event of a sniping incident must inevitably depend on the circumstances and it is impossible to lay down any governing principle beforehand. » i Ziff* 32 , I SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE. 2 NOV 1932on. behalf of the Boyal Air Tore. —' S4i &gt; we^igrsseo that aiiouid the Shaikh bring up the aatter after i hurt , „ liad. let % t Captain Mackay aliouXd lay stress oil the fact t Aae * ^«at once the w/i’ set »a B erected he~the 3haikh- TO uld be in touch with Hi.

I presume that the arguments have oeen effective as I have heard nothing further of any objection to w/T . ^ think the above minor instance of the »/r get at Shargah shows that it is as well to consider possible eventualities beforehand. If these eventualities do not come to pass no harm is done, and if they do one is pre pared for theme we have therefore to realise that the Arabian Ooaet Air Boute, a Hobson^ Choice forced on us by the action of the Persian Government, notwithstanding that the best has been made of this Choice, involves certain possible eventualities, outlined below, in the Sh&amp;rgah section, the weakest link in the chain. 4(a) Internal trouble ending, or beginning with the murder of the shaikh. The life of the average shaikh on the Tracial Coast, from the point of view of an Insurance Company, is not a ^good 1 * one, and the percentage ui Shaikhs who die violent deaths, generally at the hands of their brothers, is i airly high. The Shaikh of dhargah has gained in iBiport- ande and income by reason of his grant of air facilities t© His Majesty*® Government.-3 He 18 probably, therfore, fro« the Arab poibt 01 viaw, all th* “fatter 11 for kill the ot .e r hand he li&amp;a bought off his brother for the moment by definite p ayH e tibe Arab for billing. Payments, the aboTe facilities -.calling of the British India mail at Sharga^for instance^ are for th€ Present in his favour. That he has substantial suspicions of his X paid him the iis# 6,000—mentioned in my letter quoted above— he mould not taJse it on shore himself, but left it behind on board the sloop to be smuggled tojhis fort later unobtrusively. (b) External Attach. It must be remembered that the other 6haiichs of the 1 racial Coast, , particularly his immediate neighbours of hebai and has-al-Ahaimah, are extremely jealous of the bhargah bhaiJm. In precedenoi he is one of the smaller Hulers of the Coast: his salute is three guns whilst ,&amp;ehai receives five. Yet now with his town a port of call for the British India steamers and Imperial Airways aircraft, together with the subsidies, aim guards whiefc His Majesty’s Government are giving him, he will probably become the most important• There is good reason to believe that there was some kind of anti*alr facilities pact among the Shaikhs of the Coast, viaich relatives is shown by the fact that whenShargah has b roic«,. He ie therefore iooiceo upon, in 8 « e 5ortv ( a 8 a blacs-ieg. Both Bebal and had opportunities of giving air faculties to «i 8 aajesty.s OoTernmert and obtaining corresponding benefits. Both refused and have non, the mortification of seeing Shargah reap the benefits. If they see an opportunity of bringing trouble on ohargah, without much nsh to themselves, they v,Ui probably taise It* one way of doing this would be by ■?. large-scale attaclc on the Heat House on a day er night * that a Machine with passengers is there* But such an attack is unlikely* Arabs are not fond of attacking prepared positions, and an adequate incentive for such a serious step is in this case wanting. Moreover it would definitely compromise the Shaikhs at the back of the movement* On the occasion, however, of a visit which Captain Crab be, the Senior Haval Officer, paid me a few days ago, I took the opportun ity to discuss this possibility informally with him* We agreed that if such an attack was made a few shells from a sloop, if a sloop happened to be at/ dhargah at the time, would—in addition to the defence put up by the »ihadkh* s guard— be sufi iciont to disperse the assailants* In this con nection I may point out that Captain oiaobe (vide copy of a letter which I encloee) has asked His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief for authority to take prompt action in caoe of eventualities at Shargah. My personal opinion ie that such authority ie essential. Captain/0J&gt; Y . SSCWI: &gt; 5^he CiTil Air Bouts agreement witn the Shaiidi of Shargak now having been signed, I beg to submit to the consideration of the Commander-in-Chief that i may be given definite authority to employ the ships under command to protect, by force as a last resort, the Imperial Airways Company 1 s personnel and/or interests at bhargah. 2, The Hast House may be described as a fort within a walled enclosure. In this enclosure will be concentrated all the company * s personnel and property, and aircraft will invariably be moved from the landing ground into the enclos ure whenever they intend to remain any time at ahargah* In choosing the site for the Best house, consideration wa given to the question of its defence and there is a clear view from it to ships anchored off the town. Certain de tails as regards action to be taken by ships, should it be necessary to protect the Company^ interests, have been drawn up and have been circulated in the division for furtheTJ consideration* j?inal details will be decided upon in fcfce due course for record purposes. 3. Under the agreement the iJhaikh is bound to main tain a number of guards and Jaafc though it is not anticipated that the establishment would ever be attacked/forces which cannot be dealt with by these guards, yet it would not be sound policy to reply exclusively on the efficiency of such body of men. It appears necessary tojbe prepared for a sudden/IHii l— r ' sudden outbreak either of ~ 1 ^ighbouring Bedouin tribes of internal disorders uerb 111 ^in the town itself. or If the safety of the eaployeea of the Company or of its property is at any t*ne iaperUXe,. then U ’ lWiU b# neC88Bary t0 forces to prevent the spread of borders a„ d to protect the Company.. int ere»te. £&gt;.

Correspondence between the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (1929). Introductory Note. 1. The developments affecting the position of His Majesty’s Government on the Trucial Coast in the period 1908-28 and the question of the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in that area are dealt with in the India Office Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs, reprinted on pages 87-94 of P.G. 13. The position of the Sheikhdom of El Qatr is dealt with in the Memorandum on pages 95 and 96 of that paper. 2. Subsequent to the publication of P.G. 13, the question of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Trucial Chiefs and Qatr came under the consideration of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Sub-Committee, after considering memoranda on the subject by the Colonial Office and the India Office (papers Nos. P.G. 22 and P.G. 26), decided, at their meeting on the 19th November 1928, “to adopt the conclusions set forth in paper No. P.G. 22, para. 6, namely, that ‘our present position on the Trucial Coast is sufficient to protect essential British interests; that we should endeavour to maintain the independence of the Trucial Chiefs, and should not allow our present position in regard to them to be weakened in any way ; that we should rely upon our existing treaty rights to secure this end, and that it is not desirable at present to incur the further commitments that would be involved in the conclusion of regular protectorate treaties.’ ” 3. Since the date of this conclusion, the general question of policy has, however, again been raised in the correspondence reprinted below. Sir Irederick Johnston, on assuming the charge of the Persian Gulf Pesidency at the end of 1928, remarked in the despatch printed as No. I below, that it was for consideration whether a review of the Trucial Coast policy of His Majesty’s Government with regard to actual conditions and needs was not called for. He suggested that certain tentative proposals made by him to this end might be considered, together with the position as a whole, by Ins successor, Colonel Barrett, “who has a unique experience ol the Arab littoral Colonel Barrett's report is printed as No. 111.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 58 * 0 f the to which you have just called attention in youi let ei i o. . 9th April 1929. . , 2. The suggestions for checking the series of murdeis in the bhail^ e Abu Dhabi emanated from my predecessor^ win) ffi?P ar ^.-^on 0 f a very much imposition of any remedy to be impossible withou •,? Maiesty’s Government’s greater amount of internal contYol than is consisten w his r ^ f n the i 10pe that policy on the Trucial Coast, and, I am informed, 3 p Tmnerial Defence tlie deliberations of the Persian Gulf Section of p '?™ j u the Trucial Coast would result in the policy of a greater degree of interference m internal affairs. * Not printed. 4006 50 10.29• P. 4575/27, not printed ; but see P.G. 13, page 89, paras. 14 and 15. &amp; 3. History will, I think, show few societies which have not passed through the stage of the assumption of power by murder. Ihat it is inhuman everyone will admit, but there are many things going on on the Arab coast that are much more inhuman, and the murder of a Shaikh is only a symptom of a primitive state of affairs from which development must be gradual and which cannot be altered by the mere suppression of that symptom. Though there may be possibly some sympathy for the first Shaikh, it is difficult to feel any for his successors in the blood-stained line. They know exactly the contract they are taking on. As a matter of policy the results of interference in successions are very clearly set forth in para. 3 of Despatch No. 13 of 1927, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India.'' If a policy of interference with the will of the people and of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be adopted, the only corollary is practical annexation. Arabia is by no means exempt from the changed conditions of thought throughout the world, and the ouly hope of improvement seems to lie in the development along the Arab coast of better appreciation of the sanctity of human life and the advantages of social stability. So long as these violent changes do not affect the lives and security of British subjects, I fail to see the necessity of viewing them too strictly from the point of view of an alien school of thought. 4. As regards the wider question of our general policy on the Arabian side, I feel that with the short period of my tenure here and the small opportunity I have had, owing to difficulties of transport, of studying on the spot the problems existing there, any views I express can only be of value as the result of the application of a perfectly fresh outlook on conditions entirely novel to an experience of administration under conditions in many ways similar, gained on the Indo-Afghan frontier. Such experience as I have obtained of our dealings with the Trucial Chiefs leads me to think that possibly both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests, and that there is a complete absence of real political touch. The political duties on the Trucial Coast are performed by the Residency Agent, himself on Arab, and as such liable to Arab intrigues and partisanship. He lives at Shargah, some 8 miles from Dabai, wheie the mail steamer calls once a fortnight. 4 elegraphic communication can only be made through Henjam by special sailing arrangements in case of great urgency. Ihe hesident can only pay occasional visits and can only have a very partial knowledge of what is really going on. In view of the importance of this portion of the coast, with possibilities of Wahabi aggression and the prospect of opening up an air service, it seems a matter for argument whether the time has not now come to post at Dabai a full-time Political Agent and to instal there eegiap nc or wireless communication. Ihe Shaikhs are in general well disposed, and as life is mainly maritime there is always present in the Navy an efficacious and prompt weapon to deal with any recalcitrance. * w ith a small but seaworthy launch in which he could ^ 1S1 | 1( ^ )U y in g laikhdoms seems to be the only means by which we can maintain ea P° 1 lca _ °nc with the I racial Coast and efficiently arrange and maintain a satisfactory air service on the Arab littoral. i l/ ie C ? se similar as legaids Qatar, and it seems to be a matter for consideration ! rnffirTfip ° Se r i anC m ? re defi ;T ^Ggements should not be made with this Shaikhdom undei the political advice of the Political Agent at Bahrain. s‘itiqf?ptm-v°r! e c J iail ^ e ma ^ e on the lines above lean see little prospect of any satisfactory ci safe arrangement for aerial flight on the Arab littoral. tribes ^ n lS a PP aren t^y dealt satisfactorily with his recalcitrant Najd but in anvTT tlf T ^ 6 I 8 ' 6 a “T 6 liberal view ° r fii ghts over the Hasa coast, dotn however .71 chs, y, lce between Kuwait and Bahrain is not great.

Qatar, as well Tn.moi a P enim G.ilf is « Brilish .pk.rs ol i, SrSiM , '“' 1 “ “ k ’ **'“ - There is little exaggeration here, but it differs substantially in aeUmlitv from nnr theoretical position. 6. I cannot but think that many of the difficulties we are now encountering on the Persian side of the (mill would have been obviated had we taken earlier stock of our position and regularised and consolidated it when that position enabled \is to do so and there seems a possibility that eventually, with the growing power of Bin Sand or some other form of Arab nationalism, the time might come when failure to consolidate and regularise our claims in a more definite and less veiled manner might leave us to be shorn of privileges which we had long enjoyed, but which we had foiled to make sufficiently regular to stand before a diplomatic court. I put forward these opinions with due deference, recognising that their only value is the relative one expressed at the beginning of para. 4 above! For that reason they may possibly merit further examination by an expert, and I can think of no one better suited to do so than the officer who is to take over charge from me, Colonel Barrett who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral. 7.

Shaikh Shakbut has, however, in spite of our non-intervention, already^nominally governkl Abu Dhabi for a longer period than Shaikh Saggar. I say nominally governed;’ m during mv recent visit to Abu Dhabi it was obvious that the real governor is the murdering uncle, Shaikh Khalifa, who was treated with the greatest deference by all. No Arab Shaikh would be classed as a first-class hie by an insurance company, su it is very unsafe to prophesy ; but so far as I can judge, there is no immediate prospect of another change of riders, provided Shaikh Shakbut does nothing contrary to the wishes of his powerful uncle or the Junta, which exists in all these ptincipaliti.es. 1 doubt whether Sir Lionel Haworth's proposal, that “ in the event of a Shaikh’s heino- murdered, His Majesty’s Government will consult with the leading merchants and others of Abu Dhabi and then recognise a Shaikh elected by them,” is a real remedy. ! -it t I am of opinion that no “ removal takes place until the successor has assured himself that the Junta will not be hostile to him. If I am right in my belief, the reference to “the leading merchants and others” would merely he an appeal from Caesar unto Caesar. 3. I have discussed the subject of fratricide with those whose opinion is of value, and 1 find that so long as it is confined to a Shaikhly family, it is looked upon as an ordinary occurrence about which no sensible person will bother his head. Of course, it is forbidden in the Quran, but that is a matter between the murderer and his conscience. One night there will he shouting in the town and some shots will be fired. The citizens will close their doors and go to sleep. The next morning it will be given out that the Shaikh is dead and has been succeeded by one of his relations. It is generally a family affair pure and simple. One of the new Shaikh’s personal retainers—usually a slave—may have been involved; but in most cases the coup de grace has been administered by the new Shaikh himself, as others are diffident about committing themselves to such an extent. s In the case of Shaikh Saggar the actual murderers appear to have been Manasir Bedu, acting,under the orders of Shaikh Saggar’s brother. Khalifa ; but otherwise it is the same story. Provided Shaikh Shakbut can keep the goodwill of his relatives by giving them sufficient maintenance allowances and preserve the support of the Junta, there is no reason why he should not continue to rule Abu Dhabi. 4. The root of most of the fratricidal trouble is that although — thanks to the pearl trade—-the rulers are not paupers, they are poor, and the poverty of the State renders it almost impossible for the ruler to satisfy the demands of his numerous relations. The anxiety of Shaikh Hamad (ruler of the rich State of Bahrain) to satisfy all Iris A1 Khalifa relatives—even those with whom he is not personally on good terms—is a manifestation of the Arab rulers’ inherent dread of his relatives and anxiety to conciliate them. I am in absolute agreement with the views laid down by Sir Frederick Johnston in para. 3 of his letter No. 133 S. of the 23rd April 1929.® Unless and until the Government of India are prepared to interfere much more than they have done in the past, and are prepared, if necessary, to bolster up a weak Shaiklg however much we may regret it, the only course is to continue to shake hands with successful murder. These Shaikhs are not Europeans nor products of modern civilisation, and we cannot apply our standards to them. The result of the policy of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be seen in Bahrain and Muscat, and if Government decide to adopt it they must do so with their eyes open to the consequences. 5. It is quite within the bounds of probability that the bigoted prejudice of the Prucial Chiefs may force us to some prolicy of active interference in Trucial Oman, if we wish to establish our air service along this coast; but the time has not yet arrived when I can recommend forcing ourselves on the Shaikhs regardless of consequences. 6. Sir I rederick Johnston lurther opines that in our dealings with these Chiefs both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests. No. I, above.There is much to be said for this view, but I think he was misled into examrerathm the extent of our interference by a recommendation from the Residency Wnt th t a sloop should be sent to enforce a Bunniah’s claim against an Arab of Dubai which was received shortly before he wrote his letter. ’ cn This recommendation did not amount to a desire to collect debts by bombardment but was merely an acknowledgment of that moral influence of His Majesty’s Navy' which is so useful to us on the coast. It was not essential for His Majesty’s sloon to visit Dubai in this particular instance, but even if she had done so her presence would not necessarily have been unwelcome to the Ruler, as it would show his people that His Majesty’s Government were behind him in his attempt to enforce a just claim against a powerful subject. 7. One of the reasons for which we maintain an agent on the coast is the protection of the interests of our British subjects, who are mainly Sindi Bunniahs and Khojas. The presence of these British Indians gives us certain responsibilities, but it also gives us corresponding advantages, and I do not think it would be to our benefit that they should pack up and leave. Long experience has taught the Residency Agent that the mere threat to summon a sloop is the best method of dealing with continued recalcitrance. It is a gesture and nothing more. The fact that our Agent is himself an Arab makes him a much better judge than any European of the course of the secret intrigues that are always flowing on the coast. His nationality has also the disadvantage that our Agent cannot always keep himself free from undue interference in these intrigues. Khan Bahadur Isa Abdul Latif, O.B.E., is the third generation of his family to hold the post of Residency Agent, and the connection has continued for over 65 years, in this long period certain hereditary friendships and enmities have certainly been formed. The Bait Sarkali,” as the family are called, have attempted to take wives from the ruling Shaikhs, sometimes with unfortunate results ; they have built up for themselves a position of power and influence which arouses jealousy, but on the whole they have done excellent work for His Majesty’s Government, which none other than they could have performed. I recommend that we should continue to use the great influence of the family, but should attempt to supervise their work. 8. At present the Residency Agent works directly under the Resident in Bushire, who visits the coast once or, if means of transport allow, twice a year. In addition the coast is visited at frequent intervals by His Majesty’s ships, whose presence has a most beneficial and tranquillising effect on the more unruly elements on land. ^j le commanders of these ships are practically the supervising Political Agents of the coast, but their sphere extends from Ras al Had to Basrah and their term of service is confined to two years. In this short period it is impossible to learn the language and the customs or the local politics. The commanders must, in the nature of tnngs, he largely in the hands of their interpreters. Many of these men have done some excellent work, but the fact remains that the Resident s appreciation o tie esitency Agent’s work depends largely on the reports of Baluchi interpreters. . . ' The Residency Agent is a very astute man, and his relations with tlie navai interpreters are excellent. 9. The pav of our Residency Agent, who is so powerful on the coast an ^ ^ ways so valuable, is Rs. 150 per mensem. Out of this sum he and Ins aucesto s K hitherto nominally maintained themselves, their wives and theii nu melons &lt; ’ well as an armed guard for their protection. They have hospita j y en (1 __ motor of His Majesty’s Government, have paid for clerks, and lately have vcp P ‘ , launch and a motor car. They have also acquired a valuable poi ion i Bazaar and rich date gardens at Ras al Khaimah. . . , , Is it to be wondered at that they the objects of insinuations ur ^ ^ ^ is no proof? The leading Bunniahs of Dubai will teU me in • . fr0[n this Trucial Shaikhs subsidise our Agent and that be geta 1 s. &gt; i n r&gt;pr cent for source; they will also tell me fn confidence that our Agent takes ^ himself in every case in which his assistance is sought; they wi p oa tmen on the advice of the Residency Agent, the Shaikh of ^hai wdl-t penmt boat ^ to row them out to warships visiting the harbour , Hi ln „ t orc i er to secure his Residency Agent engineered the trouble at Dubm m Ap . ^ tratiou j ust a s his own ends, and that he secretly opposes all attempts at 1 . P writin°- nor will father did in 1911; but the/will not commit their complaints to writing they make them in the presence of the Residency Agent. ^ ^ 4006During my last visit to Dubai I asked them to propound a scheme of control for my consideration and to send it. to Dushiie. 1 he\ piomised to do so, but nothing has materialised. 10 . With regard to the question of the appointment of a British Political Agent on the Trucial Coast, the position has not materially altered since Sir Percy Cox discussed the question in his letter No. -84 of the doth January 1913 : “ We must expect the newly-elected Shaikh to continue like his predecessor in the hands of a eamorra of his ignorant and reactionary relatives, and with the means at my disposal 1 see no likelihood of being able to effect any change in their attitude, as long as present conditions of British representation on the Coast are maintained, under which, though useful in other local ways, the Arab Agent of the Residency wields no appreciably helpful influence where the larger questions of British interests or policy are concerned. “ Our forbearance from proceeding forcibly with the inception of our mild measures of progress has borne no fruit in the past two years ; on the contrary, the Debai community has only become the more confirmed and confident in its passive obstruction, through the Shaikh, to the least advance. In fact such movement as there has been, has been retrograde, for whereas no definite objection was ever evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved Europeans for business purposes, the Shaikh has made the Hyacinth incident a pretext for refusing admission to any European or quasi-European, even as agent for the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers; and I am convinced that nntil we do put our foot down to check this factious obstruction we shall make no headway.” The statements made by Sir Percy Cox are still true. The Residency Agent is of the greatest assistance in most matters; but he is still unable to force through the larger issues of British policy. On the other hand, our experience at Bahrain, where the 0overnment of India’s attempt to pursue a cautious policy failed, and finally an ultimatum, backed by force, had to be issued, shows that even British officers find it impossible sometimes to beat down the stubborn obstinacy of Arab Chiefs and their “camorra.” 11. I have consulted the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, who is in immediate touch with the Trucial Chiefs. In the course of his reply 7 to my enquiry, he wrote:— “. . . From many years of association with naval officers, both in days of smiles and crimes, the Trucial Arabs have developed a sort of friendship towards them, which they 7 do not feel towards other Europeans ; but the Shaikh of Dubai last year would not agree to naval officers landing to look around the town unless accompanied by armed guards supplied by Isa or himself. The Irucial Chiefs are definitely supicious of anything which to them appears as the thin edge of the European wedge poking its nose into their territories, and any innovation will certainly be resisted, though not by any means necessarily at once or by open methods. They object to motor-cars and motor-boats, though Isa. by patient persuasion, has prevailed upon them to allow him to possess botffi They object to such ideas as post offices and wireless, but when the slow mail calls at Dubai she receives letters to carry and the wireless opeiatoi leceives bundles of messages to send. They frankly regard Bahrain as a typical example of the grasping hand of Britain, which, being given an irndi, finally 7 obtained possession of the whole place. Whether they 7 are truly independent or not, they 7 have a sturdy spirit of independence as regards determination to control their own affairs ; and the first Shaikh who admits a Pohiical Agent to be quartered upon him will be regarded as having sold his birthright. Many if not most of our steps in our progress towards developing control of the coast have been made by 7 way 7 of punishment (e.g. permission for Qif m°u ^ ^ ie ^hargahj and this is known to the Arabs ; in fact a kffiaikh can at times keep his people under control by reminding them that if they do anything disliked by the Government the penalty will be some greater measure of Government control. Consequently the appointment of a Political Agent would he received as a serious punishment.” I have made this long quotation from the Senior Naval Officer’s opinion for comparison with Sir 1 erey Cox s views of 1913 as, together, they form an admirablesumming xip of the piesent situation. Except in the improved relations between the Navy and the Arab fehaikhs, there has been no material alteration hi the past 16 years. “ Europeans _ are still vigorously excluded from the coast The prohibition has very occasionally been modified to admit of short professional visits by American missionary doctors, but applies even to the European pearl merchant M. Rosenthal, whose presence, last year, as a competitor to Mohamed Ali Zainal would have been of the greatest benefit to the pearl traders of Dubai. One of the leasons foi the ievolution m Dubai, which was attempted by the Shaikh’s family last April, was the circulation of a story that the ruling Shaikh had given permission to Air. Straw (representative of the Standard Oil Company) to stay ashore for a night in Dubai while the mail ship was anchored off the coast. We signed the Exclusive Agreements of 1892 owing to our desire to exclude the French, and they have been useful to us. the Shaikhs welcomed the Agreements as they accorded so well with their own inclinations; and after 1911 they have zealously enforced the policy against ourselves. It is our object now to modify this unwelcome development. Although 1 do not consider it an argument for upsetting what has been done there (see my letter to the Government of India, No. 385 S., of the 28th August 1929' :;f ), I agree with the Senior Naval Officer that the example of Bahrain is before these peoples’ eyes. In the future this should be a civilising force, but at present the fear of losing their independence is a very major question and it is the greatest deterrent to permitting Europeans the slightest footing in their land. After ali, are the Shaikhs wrong from their point of view ? They are anxious to preserve their valued independence and have not yet experienced the advantages of civilisation. If they permit close contact, what will be their fate? A weak barbarian State in close contact with a strong civilised one must sooner or later be absorbed or become a dependency, however much the stronger may desire to avoid this course. The history of the growth of British power in India is proof of this. 12. A British Political Agent, although our treaties of 1820 gave us the right to appoint him, would have to be forced on the Shaikhs, and the Political Agent would have to be protected by an armed guard, ft should be noted that our Arab Agent maintains an armed guard at his own expense. The, proximity of those convenient folk—the Bedouins—would always, in the Shaikh’s mind, be a ready excuse for any “ unfortunate incident that happened to the first Political Agent. ^ . Owing to the maritime life of the coast towns, the Navy can deal with rectucitiauce, and their action, possibly with the assistance of the Royal Air force, would so gieat y exceed the hitherto mild discipline which they have occasionally administeie t lat there would be no repetition of any unfortunate accident due to bedouins,^ w lorn you know we cannot control ” : but this would be poor consolation for thefiist o i ica ^1 do not say that the first Political Agent would necessarily be murdered either at once or .in the long run, but it is a possibility which must be consi eie . I am sure that a British Political Agent would increase British influence on _ coast, and smooth all difficulties in the way of the air service. I e - e r 1 cu ies ’ °\ . to the settled Arab policy of exclusion, are considerable. It the Arabs continue their obstruction—and the air route is of vital importance am mils I®. ‘ \ quickly—I recommend that we force them to grant the necessai} mcr 1 _ 1 ®j ’ ‘ A, the same time force them to accept a British Political Agent to ensure a be no backsliding. . .. • , &gt;v^btlmp The amount of pressure required should not be excessive. - uin 0 tv,,/ Arabs position of the town, the Navy could soon force any po icy ( esi _ . ^ ^ ^ might threaten to emigrate as they did alter the 1 ’ jpg Arab trading centre such as Dubai were selected as the site foi ^ e n ,2 T 0 p 0 v ^ ers wou pi move should not be more than a trifling annoyance. e mu v a rVrotest that they go, but the Indian, Persian, and Bain eh trading had been ruined, would remain and prosper. 1 b _ •» i me thod should mustjve adopted; but I prefer that a slower and more gnidual metlroct be tried. but 13. The coaf owing to O mst and its Shaikhs arc apparently content to the example of Bahrain there are faint signs, of a st mm, y P 6258/29 : European element in internal administration of Hainanbones. Two years ago the entry of modern invention was prohibited, but now the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah is inquiring about a Ford car,, and has been for a flight in a flying boat; the Shaikh of Dubai has purchased a motor launch for himself; the richest and most influential merchant of Abu Dhabi has also purchased a launch- and inquiries are being made whether Khalil Kanoo, of Bahrain, can bring his water-boring apparatus to the coast. These are small matters, but the progressive Bahrain is having some effect on this benighted coast. I think it should be possible to take advantage of any advance that may be made, but the first desideratum is to restore that personal touch which vanished after 1910. 11. Before the unfortunate Hyacinth incident of 1910 the personal influence of Sir Percy Cox had gone far to break down the barriers of reserve and suspicion; but the whole position gained was lost by that unfortunate episode, and it has never been recovered. No successor has occupied the position of Sir Percy Cox, and during a recent flying boat visit to Abu Dhabi, Captain Prior was surprised to find that not even the name of a single successor of “ Kokus ” is known in that town. This is due to lack of touch and this lack of touch was due first to the preoccupation of the war and subsequently to the withdrawal of the Pesident’s despatch vessel. To maintain touch with his large maritime command the Resident must have a despatch vessel, at the disposal solely of himself and his Political Agents. It is impossible for him to share this vessel with any other department, as was shown when an attempt was made to make the same ship serve the double purpose of despatch vessel and tender to the lighthouses. Having obtained the despatch vessel, supervision over the work of the Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast should be entrusted to the Political Agent at bahrain, who should be relieved of routine work by his Indian Assistant. The Political Agents work may be supplemented, if necessary, by the Secretary to the Resident. dhe Political Agent must visit each Trucial Shaikh at least every quarter and be prepared, if necessary, to make a long halt off each town. At present the Resident pays one, or at most two, visits of one day’s duration each year. This is insufficient to inquire thoroughly into all problems, and the Residency Agent’s recommendations are perforce accepted. Inquiries regarding the various monetary claims of British subjects and into the diving debts of so-called debtors, who are usually slaves who ha^e absconded to Bahrain, will give the Political Agent plenty of excuse for his presence. In addition, I am hearing most disquieting reports about the prevalence of the slave trade on this coast, and I anticipate that searching inquiries may have to be made. At first, the 1 olitical Agent must return to his ship each night; but in the course of time, as he becomes better known and confidence is established, I hope he will be invrted to stay ashore for ever lengthening periods. i P 0 ^ c .y 18 gradually to restore, and improve on, the position which existed be ore the Hyacinth episode, when, as Sir Percy Cox reported, “ No definite objection w as evei evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved Europeans.” Having regained t ns position we can more easily, should we so desire, locate a British Political Agent ashore without fear of trouble. po icy is to be adopted if the drucial Shaikhs do not compel us to take sterner measures to force through our air route.

To sum up. (1) 1 he system of succession by murder, however inhuman does not of itself necessarily lend to undue insecurity, as it is purely a family concern! We may deprecate it, but, except at the cost of interference in internal affairs, the final result of which cannot be forecasted, we cannot prevent it. I myself made a slight move during my last visit to the coast by addressing a letter to each Shaikh, in which I stated that fratricide was abhorrent to God and man, and asked their .assistance in suppressing it by themselves refusing to acknowledge the succession of a fratricide. The Shaikhs one and all agreed with me in the polite Arab fashion, but I do not anticipate any great result from this pronouncement. (2) At present there is no undue interference on the coast. We have certain duties to perform in connection with the slave trade and the protection of British subjects, and it is only in connection with the performance of these duties that we interfere. (3) The projected air service down the coast has brought the time for the establishment of a Political Agent at Dubai considerably nearer ; but as a first step the people should be familiarised with the prospect by frequent visits of a British officer m the despatch boat which is absolutely necessary to carry out this scheme. (4) The Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are well disposed, provided we confine our selves to the sea, but are extremely jealous of European penetration, which they see must ultimately lead to the extinction of their independence. Every Shaikh, however well disposed he may be personally, must consider the junta and must walk warily. The coastal Shaikhs are Ivy no means devoid of the avarice of the Semites, but thanks to the pearl trade they are not in the same state of poverty as the Shaikhs of the Aden Residency area, and consequently their price is much higher. (5) 1 do not recommend tiie immediate appointment of a Political Agent to reside ■on the coast unless His Majesty’s Government is forced to adopt this course by the urgent demands of the Arab air route. (0) I can suggest no means of excluding Wahabi propaganda except sell-interest. An “ infidel ” Political Agent will never be able to withstand the agents of an all-conquering Bin Sand ; but a population accustomed to the luxuries of life wnl not wish to be subjected to Wahabi fanaticism. ..... . , If the population had acquired a taste for the advantages of civilisation anc tie Political Agent interferes no mere than is absolutely necessary to protect Dutis ^ interests, the Trucial Coast should defy Wahabi propaganda just as om ‘Tt aiic ^ 11 Force can repulse a military attack. If the inhabitants remain in tien piesen backward state, I see no remedy against propaganda except the ^oid o m &gt; air anc the playing off of Ghafiri against Hanawi.

It Is therefore difficult to state whet facilities it will eventually he possible to offer to the aircraft of the Royal jutch Air Transport Company (i-.h.M.).

Air Ministry, Gwydyr House e-*# f*4/ Accountant-General, You will remember that we had some discussion at the end ot June as to the arr&amp;nssnionts to be made In connection with the financing of the erection of a rest house to be put up at Shargah on the Truelal Coast of the Persian Gulf for use on the f tt*. fa tfa. f Arab Air riouteu The arrangement Is that the rest house is to be put up at the expense of the Sheikh of —iAw ittn (r im _ ghargah, who will receive rentSTroin His fejesty’s Government in respect of It. But as the ,3helkh is not In a position to finance its erection himself it is proposed that the Air Ministry should advance the necessary funds, recouping themselves from the Sheikh by withholding rent until the total advance has been repaid. The late Political Resident suggested ts.-4o,000 as a probable figure. xi 2. After discussion with you the Air Ministry were informed as follows, in Political Department letter of 4th July, No. P.A.3888/32:-'4. Ibe expenditure involved connection with the huxlaiDsi of the rest house and the nakintr of payments under the agreement mth the ilhelkh of Shargah will fall on Imperial revenues. The actual payments can only satisfactorily be made by or under the orders of the Political Resident. The Secretary of State thinks it Important is far as possible to simplify the procedure involved and he suggests, subject to the comments of the Air Council and the Government of India, that the simplest course will be that the necessary funds shall from time to time be placed by the Air Council to the credit of the Secretary of State in Council for India in London, on receipt of those funds the Secretary of state will instruct the Government of India to make a corresponding advance to the Political Resident. The Political Resident would be responsible for accounting for the advance in question direct to the Air Ministry, his accounts being transmitted through the India Office, which would not, however, scrutinise them. Correspondence between the Air Ministry and the Resident regarding accounts queries might be transmitted through the India Office under flying seal. I am to enquire whether the Air Council concur in the procedure proposed and to add that in view of the urgency the Secretary of State is prepared, pending examination of it, to instruct the Government of India immediately to make a first advance of fe-10,000 to the Resident on behalf of the Air Ministry.' 3.

There is no doubt that Colonel Dickson had a hard task in persuading the Dhaikh to sign the agreement, which tasi: he carried to a sueceeaful con clusion toy the exercise of tact and pertinacity — 4 ual it lea doutoly hard to exerciee in the eummer temperature of the Trucial Coast, fou will note that he speaks highly of the assistance rendered him toy lieutenant Chauncy and Commander Denison of h.ja.h. 'hideiordi 3. Paragraph 12 of Colonel Dickson-e letter. 'House and fixed fittinge'. In a separate letter .0 me Colonel Dickson states that he explained to the Shaikh that what was meant was the main touting, doors, windows, fireplace., wall- cupboards, steel beams, etc. ■The entrine and external wiring would certainly not be The/ included.The renewal of the agreement at the end of t:;ie eleven vearB, This appears to sewt the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. The clause as to the irnglish wording prevail ing seems a salutary safeguard* 4* paragraph i4 of Colonel Bicicson’s letter* Paragraph 2 of letter to the Shaikh. We certainly have no wish whatever to inter fere in the internal affairs of the shaikh. with regard to the last sentence of this paragraph regarding our support against any of the Coastal Shaikhs who threaten Shargah on account of the agreement. If such a threat is made re must obviously support the shaikh. Paragraph 3 of letter to shaikh. This assurance seems reasonable. Paragraph 4. Equally reasonable. Paragraph b. The responsibility is the Shaikh’s and therefore the guards should be under him, and the more strangers are excluded from the Best house the better, Paragraphs 6 to 8. Mo comments. b. paragraph 17 of Colonel Hickson’s letter. Lieutenant Chauncy, who was closely in touch with the late Political He si dent on Shargah affairs, informs me that Sir Hugh Hiscoe had approved of giving ti v to the Shaikh wherewith t© ana his guards, arid on general principles I approve of Colonel Hickson’s proposals. X recommend that 40 riiles —* which will leave 3 rifles as a reserve — with 200 rounds apiece be provided from India as soon as Possible. It tms and ammunition proposal is approved of the riflesZ sijouid be 8iilpp ® d to the Residency Agent, Bhargah. I may ^xd that full complement of rounds per rifle will not be issued tc the Shaikh, but that a certain number will be heldin reserve. v.,/ 6. I agree that uniforms for the guards should not he suggested for the present, or perhaps for that matter for ever. Tlie Shaiich can dress them as he Xihes. with regard to brass badges for the guards, i will maice arrangements to have these mads. The guards should certainly have some distinguishing marlfc. 7 * With regard to paragraph 18 of Colonel Dickson*3 letter, I agree generally with his views, especially in regard to taking a strong line in case attempts are made by local malcontents against the Air Station. The first six months after the air line begins / r ' w ' to operate will probably be the crucial ones. Once the local inhabitants get used to the arrival and departure of our machines, and see that the use of their coast for an air line does not mean encroachments on their liberties and independence they will be unlikely to give trouble. 8. I noticed in the agreement that no specific mention was made of the erection of a wireless telegraph station at shargah, and it oecuaed to me that having ^ regard to the mentality of the Trucial Coast Arabs, on vfoich both Sir Hu# Biscoe and Colonel Dickson have made some caustic comments that this omission might give rise to future difficulties, not necessarily from the bhaikh himself, but from any of his subjects who wished to raake themselves objectionable. Lieutenant Chauncy informed me, however, that Sir Mu# Biscoe had thought it best as a .matter of policy not to discuss the matter o^tne wireless telegraph station with the Shaikh, and Colonel Dickson to *hom I wrote on the subject replied: Negara mg wireless -station at Shargah. I do not think we shall have the -slightest trouble with the shaikh in the matter. -I mentioned quite casually to him that the■ 4 ''Sherik*' (i.e. Imperial Airways) ,ouia of course put «up an engine to provide electricity for their Heat- 'house, and would have to have tiieir own private wite.

Hie report may be considered as a continu ation ©f the late Sir Hugh Bisooe’s narrative, as given in his confidential Express letter No*400*S* dated the 21st June 1932* 3. On 14th July I received telegraphic orders from the Hon # ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, t© take the fast mall from Basrah on 16th July and #1®^ pick him up at Bushire on 17th Juljr. He had previously informed me that he proposed proceeding as far as Tamb Island in the mail steamer, and there would transfer to H*M.S*Bideford which would convey him to Shargah. He asked-a- asked, that X should acc amp any him In order that I might assist him to the final negotiations with the Shaikh of that Place, and especially to interpret for him. 4 * ° n 1,m 1 arrived at Bushire cm the British India Steam Nayigation Company's S.S.Vita, and Sir HusJi Biscoe accompanied by Lieutenant Chaunoy, his Under Secretary, immediately came on board, it is worthy of record that toe Political Resident appeared to be in the best of health. • The S«S*Vita sailed the same afternoon and arrived off Xamb Island at sunset on 18th July where the prearranged transfer was made to tie HcM.s.Bideford - Captain Denison, M»Y«0*, As no object was served by arriving at ^hargah too early the following morning it was decided to wait at Tamb till midni#t, and then to predeed. 6 « Sir Hugh Bisooe retired to rest at 11.15. p.m., both he and X sleeping on deck, and ©lose to one another* He was well and perfectly cheerful at this time. At about 1.50.A.M. he woke me up and asked for a doctor, complaining that he had a bad heart attack. X got the ship’s surgeon to him in under half a minute and although he suffered considerably fcr a while, under that Officer’s careful ministration, the Political Resident appeared to get better. At about 2.15.A.M. he asked to be allowed to lie down as he wished to sleep. At about 3.30.A.M. and while still sleeping peacefully his heart suddenly gave out. Throughout the above period Sir Hug$i Biscoe was never left alone for a minute. The ship’s course was immediately changed fj for Henjam, where H.M.S.Triad lay at anchor, and a report of the unfortunate occurrence was at once made to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. The latter made the necessary signals to London, Simla, Baghdad, Tehran and the Commander in Chief, Hast Indies station.Sir Hugh Bisooe was buried at sea about noon on 19th July, approximately six miles distant from Henjam and was given the honours due to a Flag Officer. Among those who attended the funeral were tbs Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, and staff, and the Officers of H.M.S# Triad and Si deford. Nothing could have been more fitting to the occasion than this simple though impressive Naval ceremony* 8* On the afternoon of the 19th July I despatched my telegram No*T/79 to your address repeating it to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London, a® I felt that as the senior Political Officer left in the Gulf, it was upto me to take seme action in the matter of the important negotiations that were afoot at Shargah* Furthermore I knew that the news of the Political Resident’s death would certainly reach the Trueial Coast by Arab sail ing Dhow® in 1 &amp;e shortest of time, and would result in the wildest of rumours getting about. I felt therefore that it was desirable to forestall matter® and convey the news to Shargah, and the Trucial Shaikh’s generally in person, I accordingly suggested this course to you. At the same time although I intimated my readiness to continue ihe negoti ations with the Shaikh which the Political Resident was to have himself conducted, I deemed it prudent, knowing the peculiar mentality of the Trucial Coast Arab, and his highly superstitious nature, to say that I did not personally favour this course for the moment. I rather feared that those elements who were hostile to the Shaikh of Shargah and to the Air route generally, woild not be slow to upon the Political Resident's death, as a Heaven sent Sign, and might have it in their power to spoil all the good spade work already done* 9 . Jesllag therefore that inaction waa danger ous and in anticipation of yair later sanction, X sailed for Shargah at lO.p.m. on the night of the 19/30th July, «**ac vtially befarc I reoaivefi yac.r teXegraM Ho. 1611 of SOth Zvlj, I broke Itie nows of the PoXlHoal Resident’s deatb to the Shailch, and had the necessary letters sent mp and dorni the ^racial Coast by special messengers arranged for by %e Residency Agent, Khan Bahadur Isa Bin Abdul.

H© conveyed the impression that he feared that further delay might spoiib everything, and strongly pressed me to continue the negotiations myself. n To wait” he said w for the arrival of a new Resident, whether temporary ot' permanent might spoil everything”. Th® Residency Agent also supported the Shaikh and privately warned me that If I got to work at once success was in s3#t. The feeling seemed to b© abroad that the Political Resident*s death was in part dfc© to the worry and trouble that the chiefs of the Trucial Coast had caused him, and they wished to make amends, by hastening the conclusion of the business.. I think also that at the back of the Shaikh 1 s mind was the fear that possibly a new Political Resident might succumb to Rabat blandishments and might revert to that town as providing the best Air Station on the Coast, while ixm^mxsai last but not leasts— I gathered that he suspected the Residency Agent (wrongly I think) of favouring the Shaikh of Rabat’s interests. Under the circumstances and thinking the opportunity one not to be missed, I sent off W immedi* telegram No.T/81 dated the 21st July to His Majesty Secretory of State for India, London, repeating to you. I addressed London In the first place as I had already received your telegram Ho. 1611 of SOth July in answer to my T/79 of July 19th but had as yet heard nothing from London,- 6 - London, and hoped to he able to forestall their reply in a sense. I received the Secretary of State for India* s telegrams Ho. 1932 and 1938 of the 20th and 2iet July almost simultaneously on the 81st July, and feeling greatly reassured, at once landed md proceeded with the negotiations. Tour confimatory telegram No. 1631 of 22nd July was received by me on 2Srd July* 11 # 111 Httb Lieutenant Chauncy, Under Secretary at Bushire, I spent the whole of the gist July on shore, and only managed to get back to the ship at 9.p.m. Negotiations were carried on in Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latins house (Hie Residency Agent), and were of a rather acrimonious nature at times. The Shaikh who throu^iout the proceedings insisted on having present in the room, to give him moral support on© presumes, his Wazir, one Humaid bin All, a cunning and argumentative pear if merchant who had vial ted Paris, a couple of wild Bedouin Shaikhs, and several Negro slaves, started by making all kinds of fresh and impossible demands, and for a time appeared bent on going back on everything that he had agreed to on Sir Hu$i Biscoe*s previous visit. His methods were exasperating to a degree, as time after time he would appeal to one or both ©f the Bedouin Shaikhs or to black slave, for advice and sympathy. At last in$ desperation (at about l.p.m.) I had to threaten to break off the negotiations, return to the ship, and sail away. I told the Shaikh guite openly that it was impossible for me to continue business in an atmosphere which resembled that of chattering women, rather than the deliberations of serious men. It was necessary to be rude at this stage and I think that their remarks as well as other equally caustic expressions which I used had a good- effect* In spite of the above disturbing faot#^ all highly trying to one’s patience, with the wet and drydry bulb standing in the vicinity of 100 100 f, i managed to *aft agreement, as ^bibh was submitted No*400*S. of 31st except for minor sense, I was not keep ** Shaikh to the text of the draft a^r prepared by sir Hu#» Bisooe, (copy of * 1 * to you under Budiire’s Express letter No.400 June) and steadfastly insisted, that except : alterations which did not affect file prepared to change the original text at all. I may here mention that this draft agreement together with the draft letter which the Political Resident had agreed to hand to the Shaikh, on his signing the agree ment, had already been transmitted to the Shaikh some days previously, through the Residency Agent, to enable the former to get ready any criticisms or suggestions that he mi^it desire to put forward when the Political Resident to till© agpeomcul;, was drafted on ‘tb© Hues of pax&amp;gr&amp;ph 7 of Political BesidenVs No*400.S. of 31st June.

Also on page 3 at the end of the agreement I added two new clauses the first of which I gathered from previous correspondence would not be unacceptable to Bis Majesty’s Government, while the second I considered a necessary safeguard. to renew this agreement at the end of the above period they may do so provided three months notice is given me”. arrived. j. might also add that the letter as opposed By 3.30.p.m. I got the Shaikh finally to Ehe two clauses read as follows*~ ' Should the British Government require n Should there b© any dispute as to the text of this agreement the English wording shall prevail”In the above connection please see pan telegram T /85 dated the S3rcl July* 5Rie Shai5ch argued long and nobly about the wording ot the third clause from the end. He wished me happendd to withdraw before that time. To this I refused entirely to agree. ^ w® started going through the draft letter to he handed by me to the Shaikh, and the discussion took an even more puerile and acrimonious turn than when dealing with the agreement itself. we had designs on his or his children’s independence and that we would later certainly interfere with his authority over his subjects and possibly would end by taking away his private lands from him. To appease him X gave him the necessary assurances, as detailed in my telegram No.T/85 dated the £3rd July. despatch were based more or less on paragraph 7 of Sir Biscoe* s letter No.400.S. dated the Slst June 1952 and there is little doubt that had I not been as explicit as I was, the Shaikh would have refused to sign the agreement. Shaikh seriatim, the following remarks may not be out of by the Shaikh himself, and though in parts the words seem unnecessary and redundant, they gave him satisfaction. appease his obvious anxiety lest we should leave him to ie-4id for himself should his nei^ihours start bullying him as the result of his signing the agreement# Such a contingency will in my opinion not however arise, as the nei#bour!ng to alter the wording so as to read that payments would be made to him for the full 11 years, even if Imperial Airways The Shaikh seemed genuinely to believe tln1 These as mentioned earlier in this Taking the paragraphs of my letter to the place Paragraph 2. was dictated almost entirly The last sentence I inserted myself toneighbouring Shaikhs all have their towns and village on me sea shore, and are entirely at the mercy of our ships. ®reryone knows this and in Tlew of the need to get the agreement through quickly, I saw no harm whatever in 1 inserting the sentence. It was also obvious that should the unforeseen ever occur it would be incumbent on us to take steps to secure the safety of me Air Station by bringing pressure to bear mi troublesome neighbours whose villages were on the ooast and vulnerable. This form of support is X (.eel sure all that will ever be necessary. a reasonable on the officials of the Imperial Airways would not giye to malcontents talcing refuge from the Shaikh 1 s authority. the guards being under the Shaikh’s orders, and the for bidding of his subjects from entering the rest-house withoul his permission is I think fair and harmless in themselves, ^he Shaikh wanted to make certain that the rest-house officials would not try and n TWX n the guards themselves, and also that his wild Bedouin and Town subjects would be kept out of the fortified enclosure, as most of them are light-fingered gentry, and might be tempted to rob. ' Paragraph 6 follows the procedure in vogue in other Arab States from Kuwait to Muscat, so is reason- Paragraph 7 was especially inserted to relieve the Shaikh’s anxiety in the matter of robbers or bad characters who might enter his territory from neighbour ing towns or villages not under his control, and commit some act of violence against the rest-house for purposeo a. Such things as landing parties’ operations on shore etc. etc were not envisaged either by me or the Shaikh. sanctury (dakhala) ©r the protection of Ihe British Flag Paragraph 5. This assurance, both as regardi able.of getting him the Shaikh into trouble. The Shaikh - ' 1 assured me that he would of course do his best to prevent such an occurrence, but in the very Improbable event of | sudh a thing happening he could not be expected to pursue^ the marauders into his neighbours’ territory but, would hare to confine himself to finding out and reporting exact who they were and under whose orders they had acted. Government would then have to exact punishment from the J Shaikhs whose subjects they were as she thought fit, fhe assurance in ay judgeioent was a reasonable one to give, ana in no sense need be thought to refer to organized Bedouin attacks from the interior* It is ay considered opinion such attacks are most highly improbable and need not worry us at all* Should such a raid ever materialize, one may be quite certain that it will be at the bidding of one of the coastal residing Shaikhs such as Babai etc* who all maintain and support special bodies of Bedouin to look after their camels in the hinterland, and over whom they te have complete authority. Distant Bedouin tribes like the Hurra, Manasir, Awamir etc etc need never be feared and can be ruled out of our calculations. Paragraph 8. ®dis assurance, the late Political Resident had himself decided to give as he had previously arranged with the British India Steam Navigation Company that they jdiould call at Shargah. It is not of course intended to cut out Dabai as a port of call, but for the fortnightly mail steamer to touch at Shargah in addition to Babai. fhis I made clear to the Shaikh. 15. At S.p.m. the Shaikh apparently finally satisfied with the assurances that were to be embodied in my letter to him, promised to com© on board H.M.S*Bideford and sign first thing on the following corning. Lieutenant Chaunoy and I thereupon returned to the ship and prepared-10- the agrrement and letter In their final form. 16. On 22nd July the Residency Agent and the Shaikh’s «azir came on board at lo.a.m. and said that the previous day’s negotiations had been too much for the Shailda and that h© had retired to bed sick. I at one© suspected evasion. Clearly something new was afSot as the Shaikh* s ^azir mildly supported by the Residency A gent endeavoured to get me to alter certain paragraphs both in the agreement and in the letter. At IE. noon I sent for the Shaikh, prepared to find that he had again hardened his heart. I was not mistaken. He came out to the ship at S.p.m. and from that hour till 7.30.p.m. his one endeavour was by a process of haggling to get me to alter certain portiom of the text of the agreement , and my letter to him, all of which would have been greatly to his advantage. I could see that he still mistrusted our intentions but I never- theless refused -coincide anything further. By dint of an infinity of patience and helped greatly by my knowledge of Arabic ( I dispensed with an interpreter throughout the negotiations), X managed to smooth away all the Shaikh’s doubts and difficulties once more. He signed the agrrement at 7.30.p.m. and I followed by presenting him with my ed letter containing the assurances* ^he agreement was witness by myself on behalf of the Hoa’ble the Political Resident. Captain Denison, M.T.O., R.H. dommanding H.M.S. Bideford. Humaid bin All , the Shaikh’s Wazir • K.B. Isa bln Abdul Latif, Heaidency Agent. 17. Before he left the ship the Shaikh reminded me that Sir Hugh Blscoe had given him an assurance that the 57 guards to b© provided by himself, would be provided with British Government rifles and a quota ofof amnamltion* Although the precise nature of such promise and reasonable, in view of the antiquated and miscellaneous collection of weapons which the Shaikh can only provide* British weapons will give prestige to the guards, and do much to create the necessary good impression among the local populace and tribes* I therefore strongly recommend that W .503 Government rifles with 100 rounds per rifle b© sent to the Shaikh at the earliest opportunity* ^t the same time a small brass badge, bearing the words ' Aerodrome Guards Shar&amp;ah n might with advantage be arranged for and forwarded with the rifles* For the present uniforms should not be suggested. 3*®* Before I conclude this report, I feel it incumbent on me to mention certain conclusions which I arrived at as a result of my 3 days close contact with the Shaikh of Shargah and his people. These things in my ©pinion stood out clearly. of the Trueial Coast Arab* (g) The fact that no real danger to the Air Station exists from Coastal Arab or Bedouins, provided we are firm. A s regards(a) it was very marked through out the negotiations that the chief trouble with the Shaikh was his distrust and fear of the British and what 1he future would bring him at our hands* In comparison, his fear of his own people and other coastal Shaikhs were only secondary considerations* It is important to realize this* The reaso. is not far to seek and lies in the 'Slave w quest ion* 'Slavery' in the Truoial Coast region is still common, and slaves form perhaps 85$ of the diving population* Undoubt edly also slaves suffer harsher and more cruel treatment than elsewhere on the Arab Litoral. The Shaikh 1 s chief dread is lest with the advent of aa air port in his capital we turn our attention to the slave question and start appeared somewhat doubtful, I consider ihe request sound (a) The Shaikh’s suspicious fear of u* (b) The amazing wildness and distrustinterfering in Wi„.. to b . tl , ***• *• a “SSS 01 1 ‘ 1 * W«. ninself, for ierlng the terrltorj te offer SSerert „ u u, st.tion^ to us, is also based on the sans fear and is bound entirely with this 'Slave' business. up almas’ As regards (b) it would be hard to find anywheee in Arabia a more uncouth suspicious and backward lot of *rabs than those scattered along the coast of fruciaD Oman. At the back of their minds the arrival of the Britii with their commercial aeroplanes, means the opening up of | their country, and interference with their internal affairs. Ehey therefore form useful material in the hands of their ^heilsixs wii2i will oil 1 »q firigli’toii us* As regards (c) There is in my considered opinion practically no coastal or hinterland Bedouin menace* As I have mentioned earlier the Shaikhs of all the Crucial Goast principalities subsidize and control various Bedouin tribes lying further inland, each Shaikh having his own particular following* The worst that could happen would be for a neighbouring Shaikh (such as %bai or Ajman) to order certain of his Bedouin following to enter Sh&amp;rgah territory by night and fire a shot ot two at the Air Station* This to get the Shaikh of Shargsh into trouble with us. Such child’s game is not new to us, used as we are to managing the tribes of Iraq and Transjordan and if ever such a thing happened, it would not be difficult to trace the gliding hand and inf list necessary chastisement. 19* In my opinion with the agreement signed, as it has now been, once our aeroplane&lt; start arriving, we shall have nothing at all to fear from anyone for the people will rapidly gain confidence in us. The Arab proverb that ’’The senses of the Arab ia in his eyes” holds good on the Truoial Coast as everywhere else in Arabia. Once the local Arab sees tha^ we mean them no harm, and the air rout© functioning, oil-13- all oppoeitlon and trouble will automatically opposition so far has itself in yarious cease* The attempts to bluff us into leaving the Truoial Coast. When also the local Shaikhs see we do not intend to be frightened away, they will not only accept the situation with good support that we had a ri^it to expect in this affair of th@ «Air Station'. Admittedly he has in the past, had a on land and with an insufficient salary, he had perforce _ had to play up to the local Shaikhs, as well as try and keep in with us. The proposed Air route and Air Station on the Ihrueial Coast which he looks on as his own special preserve, has I think filled him also with a certain amount of anxiety as to his own future.

No.171/567 . CIVIL AIP ROUTS - SHARJAH . Though the final agreement had not been made with the Sheikh of Sharjah, he had, nevertheless, succeeded in collecting ten dhow loads of stone and three hundred bags of cement by 9th July and had ordered 1000 bags of cement from Germany. A cash advance of 10,000 Rupees was sent to the Residency Agent on 11th July for payment by instalments to the Sheikh as the work progressed. 2. The fact that material was being collected had been reported to the Political Resident and to the Air authorities. It had been arranged for aircraft to take Lieutenant K. Mackay, R.E., to Sharjah on 19th July to draw up plans for starting the work. BIDEF0RD had been placed at the disposal of Sir Hugh Biscoe, who intended to arrive Sharjah on 19th to obtain the Sheikh’s signature to the final agreement. In addition I had undertaken to have a ship at Sharjah while Mr. Mackay was there, and thereafter at not longer intervals than a week, for two or three days at a time, from the moment work on the Rest House was undertaken. 3. When Sir Hugh Biscoe died, the aircrait were already on their way to Sharjah, so it was essential for me to send a ship there, and as TRIAD happened to be coaling, BIDEF0RD was the only vessel available. So au onerisK ox ^.ntahjino Colonel Dickson and Lieutenant Chauncy for a few aa^s, I judged it expedient to send txat ship to Sharjah in any event, because it was most important that work on the Rest House should not be held up any longer and nothing could be done until Mr. Mackay had inspected the site and had made ms report. 4. Having decided that my promises to the Political and Air Authorities should in any event be honoured, I then i 11 l!■-‘‘--jz ?—* i. ~nii&gt;iii then discussed the general situation with Colonel Dickson He had accompanied Sir Hugh Eiscoe on this mission, merely aS Sn assistant - Sir Hugh had called him on account of his expert knowledge of Arabic, but he had discussed the position very fully with him and Colonel Dickson was 'au fait' m a general way with the late Political Resident's views. But on the other,hand he had no authority to oroceed with the negotiations, and, until the report of one Political Resident's death was received in office the Government would not know even that he was on the spot, o. Colonel Dickson was himself of the opinion that in all probability the announcement of Sir Hugh's death would ,oe looked u.)on by uiiese primitive people as an event of ill omen and tnat a favourable atmosphere for proceeding at once with negotiations would not be present. On the other hand, since it was necessary for me to send BIDEFORD to the Trucial Coast, it would be much better if he announced the news officially there at once rather than allow say forty-eight hours to elapse, by which time the whole coast would probably be filled with fantastic rumours relating to the judgment of Heaven, the hand of Providence, etc. The visit in BIDEFORD would also give him an opportunity of weighing up the situation and. though negotiations were probably out of the question, yet a visit by a political officer of some standing might be of value in assisting Colonel r owle, the newly appointed Resident, in his work. 6 . As Colonel Dickson’s views were generally in agreement with my own, we decided:- (i) That it was necessary for BIDEFORD to proceed that evening (19 July) to the Trucial Coast XjO meet the flying boats in accordance with Qiy undertaking. (ii) To inform the Air Authorities of this decisipn so that there need be no question of postponing Mr. Mackay’s journey.

(vii) To inform Government that BIDE FORD would be at Sharjah until the evening of 22nd July. (viii) The Senior Naval Officer to come to Sharjah himself on 23rd July to relieve BIDEFORD. 7. The necessary action was taken immediately to give effect to these decisions. r IDEFORD proceeded on 19th 8 . Soon after 'olonel Dickson’s announcement of the death of the Political .Resident it became clear that uhe atmosphere for proceeding with negotiations was most favourable. Colonel Dickson thereupon telegraphed to Government explaining that it would be a pity to ;.ose an excellent opportunity and requesting authority to proceed in the matter. BIDEFORD was ordered to remain at his disposal. 9. On 21st July Government authorised Colonel Dicxcson to negotiate and sign an agreement on lines already 10.

In uis opinion the work will proceed satisfactorily, buo ior a variety of reasons, transport to une rest nouse site in particular, the building cannot be completed by 1st October. He has made proposals for the nire Ox a lorry to transport stone from the shore, and for erecting temporary shelters until the Rest House is completed. All these matters are being dealt with as urgent problems by Air Headquarters. 11* By B 6 th July the Sheikh had collected .twenty seven dhow loads of stone and had thirteen dhows at Tumb collecting more, so there is little doubt that he intends to play the part assigned to him. Lieutenant Mackay will arrive Sharjah on 11th August and wi 1 remain there for about three weeks. During this period, H.M. Ships will pay frequent visits to the port. (Sgd. ) L. S.

Sir, I have the honour to report that I left Henjam at 2200 on Tuesday, 19th July, with Lt.Col. H.R.P.Dickson, O.I.E., (Political Agent at Kuwait) and Mr. F. C. L. Chauncy (Asst. Secretary to the late, the Hon. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir Hugh Biscoe, K.B.E. ) on board. SHARJAH . 2. I arrived at Sharjah at 0600 on Wednesday, 20th July. The Residency Agent and his clerk arrived on board about 0900. The news of the death of Sir Hugh Biscoe was conveyed to him and the general situation with regard to the negotiations for the Civil Air Route, was discussed. 3. The Sheikh arrived on board to call, half an hour later accompanied by his usual entourage. The news of the Political Resident’s death was communicated to the Sheikh and his followers and it was evident that the tidings genuinely affected them. 4. During the Sheikh's visit, which was of short duration, the question of the negotiations was not mentioned. Before leaving the ship, the Sheikh, quite spontaneously, asked me whether on this occasion his customary salute might be waived, out of respect f^r the memory of the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, whom he said was held in such high esteem oy tnern all. I accepted his offer with gratitude. I suggest that such a gesture coming from the Sheikh shows that at, times he possesses a nice regard for the courtesies of J -i^ e and the feelings of others. 5 . After the Sheikh had left the ship a long discussiondiscussion took place between the Residency Agent and Colonel Dickson* The fomer expressed his definite opinion tnau had the late Sir Hugh Biscoe been able to have been present here at this time, he was'certain that tne Sheikh, after talking over certain disputable points, would have been prepared to sign. He (the Resident Agent) further said that if only Colonel Dickson could be empowered!o carry on with the negotiations the situation might still be saved. 6 . The atmosphere was distinctly friendly, he continued; the news of the Political Resident’s death had come as a great blow to them and they knew how dear to him (the Political Resident) had been the hope of getting the matter settled. 7. They knew Colonel Dickson, liked and trusted him, and his strong personality aod fluent Arabic were a' 1 adding to the favourable atmosphere. He (the Residency Agent)said that he thought there was much more chance of the matter being settled under Colonel Dickson’s auspices than there would be if the matter was delayed until the arrival of a new Political Resident, who would be a stranger to the Sheikh and his advisers and of wnom they would be frightened. 8 . The various controversial problems of the proposed agreement, viz. Method of repaying advance ior building rest-house; duration of agreement; ownership of rest-house; European mechanics; external aggression, etc., were discussed at length and it was fount to-iat in a number of cases the faulty Arab translation of the script accounted for the problem. Some proposed modifications were suggested which it was hoped would be acceotaf 6 t 0 both H.L • Government and the Sheikh. 9 . The question of the B.I. Agent at Debai was then discussed and it was mutually agreed that the following appearedwmm —~ © appeared to be the best proposal for solving the present problem * j J; ' e V a ? en t (now completely recovered) continue carrying on the duties of Agent and tnat the new man (to whom great exception nas oeen taken by the SheiHi oi Debai) should be removed. That, should the B.T. still press for a cnange of Agents, fomal notice of thlir desire together with the name of the suggested relief ’ the P ° liti “ 1 ''M* «* iO. One of the latter’s great objections to the present man appears to be that he was sent to Debai without any notice or warning being given first to the Sheikh. In other words, the latter’s amour propre has been wounded. ...he Residency Agent stated that if the proposal mentioned at x was carried out, he felt certain the Sheikh of Debai would offer no further opposition. • L -* At about 1100 (20th July) while these discussions were still going on, Seaplane No. 1433 arrived (F/Lt. Pearce) with Captain Mackay on board. The latter came on board and as seaplane could not remain at Sharjah she returned to Has-al-Khaimah for the night, Captain Mackay being accommodated on board BIDEFORD. 12. The Residency Agent landed about 1500 and promised to put the proposed solutions of the before- mentioned problems before the Sheikh. 13. At 1700 Colonel Dickson, Mr. Chauncy and I landed to return the Sheikh’s call. This was merely a courtesy call, as the Residency Agent had not had time to approach the Sheikh. Mo business was discussed, but the favourable atmosphere was still most noticeable. 14. our return on board Colonel Dickson sent his telegram Mo.ol/T of 20th July, 1032, to Simla explaining the situation and asking for authority to treat and if necessary sign on behalf of the Government. 15. Captain Mackay had come ashore with us and had made a thorough inspection of the state of affairs as far as i Ias his part 01 the business was concerned. His report is contained in nis signal 1100 dated Hist July, to Aviation, Baghdad, repeated to S.N.O. 16. The next day, Thursday Hist July, there was a fresh breeze from Northward, accompanied by a slight northerly swel 1 . As ship was not swung to the wind and 8 e; ’ ^ ue to 'the tide, there was a slight motion on the ship. 17. Residency Agent came off at 0900 and reported that he had seen the sheikh last night and that atmosphere still anoeared favourable. At this juncture Colonel Dickson, who is not too good a sailor, said that, if he remained on board-and carried on with the discussions on board here, he did not feel he would be at his best or be doing himself justice. It was therefore decided that Colonel Dickson, Mr. Chauncy and the Residency Agent should adjourn to the latter’s house ashore and continue their deliberations there. A signalman was sent ashore with them and signal communication established between the shin and the roof of the Residency Agent’s house. 18. Meanwhile the swell, preventing Seaplane No. 1433 from picking up Captain Mackay, who had intended returning to Bahrain and Basrah to-day, Captain Mackay. decided to stay another night on board. Seaplane was ordered to Debai to await further orders from Captain Mackay. 19. Colonel Dickson and Mr. Chauncy returned to the ship about 1930 having spent the whole day arguing with the Sheikh. HO. At 0900 on Friday, 22nd July, the Residency Agent again came and further discussion took olace between Colonel Dickson and the fomer. Meantime a fail copy of the Arabic portion of the Agreement had been typed embodying the small alterations agreed to by Colonel Dickson and. asked for by the Sheikh. 21. At 1430 the Sheikh and his advisers came on boanrdIdocL d. and f t cni 'tiisn until tiiG Pj^tq ©niGnt/ was signed at 19^9, a continuous discussion (at times very heated) tone place between the Sheikh and his followers on one side and Colonel Dickson on the other. The objection; raised by the Sheikh were of the most trivial and Government was more than fortunate in having Colonel Die'.son on the spot. There is no doubt that his amazing paoLenee, (tried like I have never seen oatience tried before), his fluent Arabic and his strong personality were largely responsible for the successful conclusion of the agreement. 22. A curious incident occurred as the Sheikh eventually left the ship, at 2000. As a special honour to dim, I decided to waive the regulations and give him his 3-gun salute after sunset, at the same time outting a searchlight on his Flag at our foremast. As he was going over the side he said he thought he ought to have a few extra guns, just having signed the agreement (which incidentally is very much to his pecuniary advantage). I regretted that I could not do that, but pointed out that he was getting such an honour of having his salute fired after sunset, that not even the King of England would get. He then said that if he couldn’t get any extra guns, he did not want any at all. 23. Flying Boat No. 1433 arrived at Sharjah at 1000 and left for Bahrain at 1530 with Captain Mackay. 24. Colonel Dickson snd Mr. Chauncy went on shore and dined with the Sheikh, returning on board at 2330. 25. H.M. Ship under my command left Sharjah at midright for Pearl Banks.

The Political Resident's j. observations are contained in his telegram of 5 th august, on P.Z.4722, and the Government of India (see their telegram of 12th August, now submitted) have nothing to add to them, we had, of course, all along recognised that it would be necessary to get formal permission from the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sultan of Muscat (and any other Arab rulers who might be affected) before facilities could be granted on the Anst) side of the Gulf to Dutch or French planes* The Sultan of Muscat's complaint about flights over Gwactur will he dealt with as soon as we receive his formal letter from the Political Resident. - A draft demi-official letter, for my ' signature if approved, to Mr. Baxter is now submitted. As suggested on P.Z.4521, it will be well to take this opportunity to insert in the reply to the Dutch a reference to our desire that their planes shall comply with the advice of the British political authorities at Bahrein and elsewhere in the Gulf. We can go into the matter in greater detail, if necessary, at a later stage. We might leave the drafting of this passage to the Foreign Office, 'who are better able to judge how to put it most palatably 3, The opportunity is taken to submit certain other papers which have been received since this paper was last put forward. ^ The text of the Agreement with the Sheikh of Shargah and of the letter of assurance given to him have^now been received (see P.Z.4664/32, flagged) The Agreement is in the terms approved by the Secretary/ 'Secretary of State (the original draft is flagged, I ■: the amendments suggested hy Colonel Dickson and reported in his telegram of 23rd July, on P.Z.4400, being shown on that draft in red ink). The letter of assurance given to the Sheikh follows the general lines suggested in paragraph 7 of Sir Hugh Biscoe's express letter No. 400-3 of 21st June, on P.Z.3859/32, flagged. A summary was received in Colonel Dickson s telegram of 23rd July, on P.Z.4400. , prom Squadron neader Kerhy's letter of 4th August, on P.Z.4719, it will he seen that the Dutch have now put a new type of aircraft into service on their East Indies line, with a range of 930 statute miles. 'This should greatly ease the position as regards facilities on the Trucial Coast and disposes | of the hesitations we felt about requiring the Dutch to fly in one stretch from Bahrein to Gwadur (about 750 miles). The Air Ministry think it probable that ' the French will put on craft of similar range* If they do not we ir&amp;y have, in due course, to face with them the difficulties over Shargah which we had apprehended in connection with the Dutch. The question of establishing an emergency landing ground for the civil air route on Halul || Island was raised at the interdepartmental conference of 19th July (see my letter of 4th August at flag I, suggesting amendments in the record). I understand from the Air Ministry demi-officially that they are much attracted hy the idea and are consulting the A.Q.C. Iraq about it privately..

Di the first place, as the Resident points out, it will be necessary for us to obtain the formal permission of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sultan of Muscat to the use of Bahrein and Gwadur by Dutch planes. The Dutch have a commercial agreement with Muscat and it will, of course, be possible for them to communicate direct with the Sultan on this ii- subject. On the whole, however, we are inclined to think that, if the Foreign Office see no objection, it would be better that in both cases the communication ■ ; • / should/\U 1 t /1) ■ ' m should he made through us on behalf of me Dutch am we suggest that we might CoTTerto take t e * necessary steps when the time comes to secure the concurrence of the Arab rulers concerned, in th^- 3 Our second point is one of more substance. As you will |i d remember, I referred in the meeting of 19th July to the desirability of securing from the Dutch and French in the event of their using the Arab route an assurance that their companies jiVould keep strictly to an agreed route and that they would comply with any instructions which they might receive from British officials in the Persian Gulf (since it might well happen on f occasion that we could not guarantee adequate security even on the agreed route). In the discussion we had, of course, particularly in mind Shargah and the Trucial Coast. But awkward situations might equally arise from forced landings on the Hasa coast or misunderstandings of our special position in Koweit and Bahrein and we consider, therefore, that it would be well to/ oDepartment. to take the present occasion to inaicate that our position in this whole area i s rather special, as are the local conditions, and that in the interests of securing smooth working and thl^^QQ.^ any local difficulty it would te necessary for us to require an understanding of the type suggested above. 4*. 1 understand from Kerby that the Dutch have now put a new type oi aircraft into service on their East Inures line, with a i%nge of 9*50 statute miles. We hope very much that this may ease the position as regards any request from the Dutch for facilities on the Trucial Coast, either now or later. But unless and until the French start to employ aircraft with a similar range the same problem may, of course, arise with them.

Previous Papers :■Minute Paper, POLn xcal Department. Please see previous submission on P*Z.4154/32, flagged below, on the question of the line to be taken on the request for facilities for foreign aircraft on the Arab Air Route which had been raised by two notes from the Dutch Legation. The question was discussed at an interdepartmental conference held at the Foreign Office on the 19th July. A record of the proceedings is attached (copies have been sent by this week's air mail to the Government of India and to Bushire). As will be seen, the discussion was exhaustive. The conclusions reached by the meeting (as regards the grant of facilities on the Arab Air Route to the Dutch and French) were, broadly, first, that it would not be possible to refuse to grant facilities on the Air Route, but that we should be justified, at any rate during the experimental period while we were trying out Shargah and the facilities arranged there, in requiring the Dutch and French to fly direct without any intervening landing from Bahrein to Gwadur. The Air Ministry were satisfied that their machines were sufficiently powerful to make this possible. The grant of facilities at Shargah (and it was recognised that facilities there would ultimately have to be granted) was to be postponed until we had greater experience of local conditions and could with confidence extend the facilities enjoyed by ourselves to the Dutch and French. The general sense of the meeting was that the adoption of this attitude was unlikely to give rise to international feeling or difficulty and that it could 35a 3000 5 31easily be defended in the special circumstances. Finally, it was generally agreed that, if and when facilities were granted to Dutch and French aircraft at shargah, we should make it a condition that the foreign aircraft concerned should undertake to fly a strictly delineated course and should undertake to comply with such instructions as they might receive from our political officers in the Persian Gulf. As regards the Dutch note of 17th June, suggesting a joint approach to Persia hy France, Great Britain and Holland with a view to securing an extension of the South Persian Airways permit in return for an offer to hear expenses in connection with the route, it was decided that, while H.M.G. should return a negative reply, that reply should he Iso framed as to make it clear that their reluctance to co-operate was the result of their decision to transfer to the Arab side of the Gulf, and should leave the door open in case at some later stage we found it desirable to endeavour to revert to the Persian shore of the Gulf. ^ The draft note to the Dutch Government which has been prepared in the light of the discussion and in which our concurrence is asked is, 1 think, broadly speaking, suitable. We might, however, draw attention in replying to the Foreign Office to the desirability inform^ the Dutch in detail of the facilities which will he granted them at Bahrein and Gwadur &amp;&amp;&amp; emphasising our special position in Bahrein and Muscat and the political difficulties involved in descent on the Hasa coast. It is of real importance that foreign aircraft should comply with the instructions of our local/A 1 Gr^ &amp; - ^ foreign OFFICE. S.w.l. (E 3669/3307/65) 'I COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL of So^y^i 1932 .

Please see Colonel Dickson’s telegram of 19th July and the Government of India’s comment on it, together with the demi-official letter of to-day from Air Vice Marshal Burnett. It is, of course, j* common ground that it is of the first urgency to get the Sheikh of Shargah’s signature to the draft agreement and to secure that the work in connection with the erection of the Hest House is pushed on as quickly as possible. Now that we have persuaded the British-India Company to agree to stop at Shargah and triat we are prepared to finance the Sheikh by a system of advances, there ought to be no further difficulty. But the balance of advantage seems definitely to rest with leaving it to Colonel Fowls to handle this matter. There is in the first place the danger that J Sir Hugh Biscoe’s death might have an unfortunate effect on the Sheikh (perhaps one would pay less attention to this suggestion if it came from anyone who spoke with less a uthority of Arab mentality and customs than Colonel Dickson). Secondly, it would be very unfortunate if Colonel Dickson (who cannot carry nearly as many guns as the Political .Resident) were to meet with a rebuff at Shargah. Finally tne delay involved in waiting for Colonel Fowls ought not to be great. It seems doubtful whether, if the negotiations a re to be left to Colonel Fowls, there is really much point in a purely courtesy call such as Colonel Dickson contemplates and the Air Ministry strongly/ 35a 3000 5 31strongly share this view. It is arguable, however that Colonel Dickson might be able to some extent to prepare the way for an early visit by the Resident. We might indicate to the Government of India that we see no particular point in ohe courtesy visit, but leave trie decision to them. The possibility that the Sheikh may be willing to sign Immediately cannot be overlooked. 3 o far as we know, however, he has not ye u oeen informed officially of the contemplated arrangements for stopping the slow mail at Shargah and some explanation and negotiation may be necessary before his signature can be obtained. From this stand point also it seems better to let matters standI*aithwaite Esq., Political Department, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Yours sincerely, AIR MINISTRY, adastral house, KINGSWAY, W.C.2 20th July, 1932. My dear Laithwaite, Kerby has just shown me the wire you have re- celved from Dickson with reference to the negotiations with the Sheikh of Sharjah. Our one aim and object is to get the Sharjah buildings started and set up as soon as possible and the civil air route going. If we do not there can be no question but that British prestige will suffer, not only in the Gulf, but elsewhere. y° u realise, it is of the utmost importance that work in connection with the rest house is proceeded with as quickly as possible. I feel that if Dickson is given direct orders that this work must be gone on with in any event and that no refusal will be taken, the matter will go through. If, on the other hand, you are not prepared to do this until the acting R.P.G. arrives, I should say wait until he comes. Otherwise the Sheikh will try and sidetrack the whole matter, claiming that he cannot negotiate further for fear of his relations and the Shahu tribes in the mountains, but of course this is a political matter on which you are the best judge.ti y Air Mail n DA). b73-S of 193 2. ±sritiah residency and Gonsulate-general, uushire, the 12th August 1932.

Mr. Alexander Shaw, in reply to Sir Findlater Stewart’s inquiry of 29th June as to the possibility of the British India Company arranging for the slow Gulf mail to call at Shargah, stated that he was making reference to by the mail of 7th July in case there might be any difficulty. The Resident is coming on leave at the beginning of August and it would be desirable, if possible, that he should clinch matters before he.leaves Bushire. The main outstanding point is now the calling of the slow mail and if we can secure this there ought to be no further difficulty in obtaining the Shaikh's signature to the agreement granting us air facilities. It is the more important to dispose of the matter that we are anxious to get the route in working order oy 1 st October. Sir F. Stewart would probably not want to trouble Mr. Shaw personally again, but I Blight get m touch with his private secretary, explain the urgency, andask the P. and 0. Company if they could ask for a telegraphic reply from Bombay. Sir H. Biscoe,in a private letter of 30th June, says that he has discussed the matter with the Bahrein agent of the British India Company who thought that^ there should be no difficulty. Meanwhile we telegraph to the Resident as in the draft attached. 7 T~r £0 Y ■i--* *»• » 1 .

If decision likely to be delayed, could you kindly inform me approximately when 1 may expect instructions so that I can try and arrange transport.(j-ASjLa. l.^- rac ^ trom private c^gaa^Q»4 A3aj&gt;A •betwoon S^Jjuift B i 3 c o e^ami l^La i thwaTTe dated 3Oth June 19321 * K K K K K K As regards the Shargah rest house, I thought it as well to send you a private and personal telegram which I made very concise. Actually the position is this. We must use the Shaikh as contractor since he is the only man who can send out boats to bring in stone and who can supply the requisite labour, donkeys, camels, etc. Now, if we use the Shaikh as contractor since he is not a capitalist we must advance him money, therefore in practice there is really very little difference in the actual procedure whether he builds it or we do it. Politically, however, there is an enormous difference, and moreover if he builds it himself he will build it cheaper than we can. A Trucial Shaikh is entitled to call on his subjects for certain services in return for the protection that he is supposed to afford them. The Shaikh therefore will send out his own people and they will produce stone, etc. at a low rate. If we build even with the Shaikh as contractor the position will be quite different and as I say he will expect to make a profit. Finally, in the one case we should obtain a large measure of good-will, while if we employed him as contractor I do not think he would like it. If we revert to the Persian side within a year or so then in any case we lose the cost of the building. If we build ourselves then our loss is obvious. If the Shaikh builds we cannot recover from him the sums advanced to him; it is not .air to as the Shaikh to put up an expensive building and chen say a year later that we no longer require it. the loss built it would, I think, be less than if we built it as the We need not take into account the rent For/ cost would be less.1 C.&amp;\ For if we built it we should pay him no rent, and if he built it we should pay him no rent for at least ten years. Your suggestion that we should recoup ourselves in three years is, I am afraid, rather optimistic. The Shaikh must have ready cash to keep his relations and local 'Badus' quiet, and this is especially important during the first two or three years of the service, and therefore all that I have suggested that we should recover frcm him is Rs.3600 a year, the rent of the house. As regards the mail steamer, I agree that it would be preferable if it could pay an additional call at Shargah, and the Bahrain Agent with whom I discussed the matter said he thought there should be no difficulty about this. On the other hand the Debai people deserve scant consideration and I think it is almost essential in our own interests that the mail should call at Shargah, so I would be prepared to face possible reactions at Debai if it could not call at both places. They will be sending down a lot of material for the rest house at Shargah shortly, furniture, wireless and electric light plant, steel joists, corrugated iron, doors, windows, provisions, etc. , etc. , and it will be an awful business if we have to load all this stuff into lighters at Debai and take it round to Shargah. Again, once the service is established it would be a very great convenience to Airways to have the mail calling at Shargah. They are bound to need to send provisions and other goods to Shargah at frequent intervals.

Minute commenting and submitting for orders the question of line to be taken by India Office representative at forthcoming Inter-Departmental Conference, y ? il i ill I aiiMinute Paper. Department. At Mr.Handel's request I discussed informally with him yesterday. 11th July, a new situation which has arisen consequent on the receipt of two notes fran the Dutch Legation in connection with the Arab air route. The first of these notes, which is dated early in June, after reciting extracts from *W various international Air Conventions and Resolutions of the League, the general effect of which is to emphasise the desirability of friendly co-operation by interested Governments in the improvement of air communications, proceeds to examine in detail the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the continuance of the permission to fly the South Persia air route held at present by Imperial Airways, the Dutch and the French. The note suggests that much of the difficulty has no doubt arisen for financial reasons, f ^ that if those difficulties could be removed, Persian scruples might be overcome, and in these circumstances makes a proposal for a joint demarche to Persia by the interested Governments, to be coupled with an offer to bear jointly all expenditure involved in the preparation of the necessary landing grounds, etc., in return for an assurance by Persia that all reasonable local facilities would be given and security ensured. 2. The second note, which was dated the 5th July, states that the Dutch Government understand, from a communication from the Director of Civil Aviation in London, that the Arab route is under preparation and that facilities would be granted to Dutch aircraft to use this route. They ask for confirmation of this assurance and further request the fullest possible information about the Arab air route and the details of its organisation. 3./ 35a 3000 5 313. As regards the first of these notes, there is now little point in a joint demarche of the type suggested. It is conceivable that we might have made sane progress along this line at an earlier stage, but the Foreign Office were at that time opposed to it, and though the subject was discussed nothing ever came of it. We should, I think, clearly have little to hope fran it now. The Persians would point out that H.M.G. had deliberately chosen an Arab air route in preference to a Persian route because, in our own words, we thought it more suitable, and would refer the Dutch and the French to pt for facilities to fly along that route. We shall probably do best to leave matters as they are,^~ concentrate on the Arab air route while maintaining our M.F.IT. demand in respect of the Persian route. If the Dutch or the French wish to make an independent approach to Persia and succeed in securing any concession fran her, we shall be in a position to demand the extension of a similar concession to our own air liners. 4. The second note raises more difficult questions. We have always foreseen that once the Arab air route came into being we should have to face the problem of foreign requests to be allowed to fly that route with all the political difficulties involved. The India Office reservation contained in para.22 of the Report by the Middle East Committee, which was submitted to the C.I.D. in May 1932, deals with this question at sane length, as do the Air Ministry comments in para.20 of the same note. The matter was left for further consideration by the C.I.D. Report and it is most regrettable, in these circumstances, that the Civil Aviation Branch of the Air Ministry should have can promised our position by making any such statement to the Dutch Government (it is understood to have been made/“““ Minute Paper. Department. n ' Cccf&lt;\ 4 t ^Y , ^ J uV*M Xr *v^. ')WO»Y- tKCJUdbt- 4+ ^Y'^/vy Yx^u^tX^ Si (x aXL#ur-&lt;^ 'fe-' made in a demi-official letter) as is now reported. The problem is, however, one which must now be faced, and the Foreign Office propose to hold in the immediate future an inter-Departmental Conference for the purpose of considering the line to be taken. 5. Sanething must turn on the course of discussion in the Conference. Further, before any decision can P e it will b e necessary to consult the Government of India^on the general question (if only as — ^ a matter of form) and to obtain Sir Hugh Biseoe*s observations on possible local difficulties in the Persian Gulf. It will be remembered that we have not yet succeeded in securing final authority from the Shaikh of ♦ Shargah to build a rest house in his territory and that in return for such facilities as we require we are proposing to pay some Rs.30,000 per annum. From the Residents despatch it seems fairly clear that our difficulties will be overccme if we can persuade the ■ P. &amp; 0. Company to stop the slow mail British India steamers at Shargah in addition to or in substitution for their present stop at Debai. This matter has been taken up with the P. &amp; 0. and referred by them to their f * Agents in Bombay, and welpiay hope to have a reply in the i jd near future. But it is quite possible that the Shaikh,&lt;s^ &lt; n if he is prepared to meet us, may take alarm if he is 35a 3000 5 31 asked in addition to grant facilities to the Dutch and French air liners, while if additional ground organisatioi is involved to deal with the calls of those liners, the question of expense may assume some importance. 6. The alternatives open to us are to allow the French and the Dutch (on the assumption that it is decided to open the route to foreign aircraft) to negotiate themselves/■■ themselves with the Shaikh of Shargah, or ourselves to negotiate with the Shaikh for such an extension of our agreement in respect of Imperial Airways as will admit off French and Dutch using the facilities to he granted to us. On the whole I think the second alternative is definitely the preferable. So far as finance goes, if additional expenditure is involved in the preparation of landing grounds or the extension of the rest house accanxnodation, the simplest course will he to debit the French and the Dutch with such expenditure, retaining all the local arrangements in our own hands, though by- accepting payment from them we shall also accept a certain 'additional responsibility in respect of their property and its condition. 7. As regards the political difficult!es,the next question for consideration is the line to be taken with foreign Governments as regardsfconditions on which they may be allowed to fly this route. No difficulty arises as regards Bahrein or Koweit, but our position is by no means comfortable on the Trucial Coast. For while the Rulers of that area are precluded from dealing with any foreign Power save through us, and while we maintain the siaritime peace by such control as is exercised by any -4 outside authority with bther States, the Trucial area is not a British Protectorate and our policy has in the past Consistently been to avoid any commitments in respect of its internal affairs. On the other hand, as has been pointed out in earlier discussions by precluding foreign Governments from dealing direct with these Shaikhs we inevitably assume responsibility for dealing with the consequences of any unfortunate incident - the crashing of a foreign aeroplane in the hinterland and the murder of its passengers or crew, a/linute Paper. Department. a raid on the Jfoargah rest house, local sabotage. I suggest that we must accept these liabilities and that (subject to the course of further discussion with the interested Departments) the best course for us to follow with foreign Governments would be to say that we should be glad on behalf of the Shaikh of Bahrein (and the Shaikh of Koweit if necessary) to afford them facilities in those two States, but that the Trucial area presents problems of a quite peculiar type, that the Rulers of this area are in special Treaty relations with H.M.G. whose control however does not extend to the hinterland, which is inhabited by independent or semi* independent tribes and by Bedouin, to whom it is difficult to apply any sanctions in the event of misconduct, that we have had the greatest difficulty, owing to the suspicious and semi-barbarian nature of the inhabitants of this area, in securing facilities at Shargah, that (if this is in fact the case) we have persuaded or will endeavour to persuade the Shaikh to extend these facilities to the French and the Dutch, but that we must make it clear that in the peculiar conditions of this area it will be necessary for their land planes to keep strictly to the route from Bahrein to Shargah and to be advised by our local representatives at all times as to the course to be taken, and that it is of the utmost importance, in view of the difficulties which might arise in the event of an aeroplane crashing in the hinterland, or of any incident at Shargah, thatinstructions received from our local representatives should be strictly ccmplied with. As regards expenditure we could address them on the lines suggested in the pieceding paragraphs^ +(&gt; . 35a 3000 5 31 c a- vuLnder 'tne Air Havigai:ion Gonveniion, we are bound, if we allow an International Air Route over cur own territory to give what practically amount to National tights trover it to the other parties to the Convention. The U.K., India, France and ohe .ueiiierlands are all parties to the Convention But the Arab Route is not over British territory, and the Convention cannot be held to apply in the sense that either the Dutch of the French cans demand facilities as of right, since the Shaiks are not parties to it. Persia on the other hand is a party to the Convention with the result that any international air route which she permits must be opened to all other parties. At the same time the policy of H.M.G. has be«n to favour the greatest possible freedom of international air communicatioi and no doubt it will in practice be necessary to Secure passage for the Dutch and French along the Arab Route, but the position being what it is it should not be impossible to get something in return from these countries. For instance it might be thought to obtain from them a iresh pi omise o reciprocal facilities, which will be wanted from the Dutch in respect of the Australian service and from the French in res-ed of Hongkong and Shanghai.

We have now received in addition a full and detailed account of the negotiations at Shargah from Sir Hugh Biscoe (P.Z.3859/32) which amplifies the telegrams in question. ^* Prom the Resident’s full report it will be seen (what was not quite clear from the earlier telegrams) that we have not yet secured the Shaikh’s signature to the draft agreement and that if we are to hope to do so it is of great importance to secure that the mail shall x at any rate call at Shargah. This point we have already taken up with P. &amp; 0. Colonel Biscoe further has increase# the payments to the Shaikh from Rs. 20,000 odd to Rs.28,600, for the reasons given in para. 10 of his letter. We need not dissent from this increase and it is indeed for consideration whether the net sum which the Shaikh will receive annually (Rs.15,000) under the arrangements now contemplated and further discussed in the following paragraph, is not on the small side. On the whole, however, the Department is inclined to think that,having regard to the value of money on the Trucial Coast and the fact that it would have been open to the Resident to recommend some increase had he thought this necessary, we need not ourselves suggest any addition at this stage. 3. The views of the Air Ministry on the arrangements proposed by Sir Hugh Biscoe for the building of the rest house summarised in para. 2 of his telegram, T. 7 6 on P.Z. 3633 / 32 , and further elaborated in paras.2 to 4 of his letter/ 35 a 3000 5 31■ rl jS/32) are given in their letter of 28th June on P.Z.3640 now submitted. We have been inclined here to feel seme doubt as to whether the arrangements in question did not bear rather hardly on the Shaikh, rle is being required to erect a rest house which he does not want at a substantial cost to himself (for the bulk of the expenditure will be recovered from the rent which he would otherwise have received), and has to face the risk that at some later period we may either cease to use the rest house at all (this (is not probable) or so reduce the use we make of it that a substantial reduction in the annual payments ms.de to him will ce inevitable. But the is Resident, with the advantage of local discussion, fpaoVTii-d that the arrangements proposed are the best in the circumstances^ tfh.e Air Ministry feel that we ought to defer to his judgment in the matter, and the Department accepts this view. 4 The Air Ministry however couple their acceptance of I these financial arrangements with a proviso that the agreement shall preclude the Shaikh from determining their tenancy at some future date, and from either putting the building to some other use or seeking another lessee. They have overlooked the fact that w r ith their concurrence the Resident was instructed on 11th June to aim at an agreement for an indefinite period, but failing that to accept 11 years. He has exercised his discretion in accepting the 11 year period (compare his arguments which have, I think, great force, in favour of this course in para. 12 of his letter of 21st June'*. While the agreement has not actually been signed we cannot now very well ask him to go back on what has been done. Although I understand that the Air Ministry will not press the point they still attach importance to securing their position further and I suggest that we might aim a Pi- ?7S3(nfa at/Minute Paper. Department. at the inclusion in the last paragraph of the draft agreement of a provision that the agreement shall be renewable at the option of Imperial Airways on the expiry of the 11 year period. 5. The Resident in his telegram T. 76 asks for immediate authority for an issue of Hs. 1,000 (it appears from his letter of 21st June that the amount should be Rs.10,000). A further telegram (copy attached) has since been received from the A.0.C.,Iraq, to the effect that no progress is possible at Shargah until the necessary advance has been made. There will be considerable expenditure (all from Imperial revenues) in connection with the air route, both on the building of the rest house and in connection with the Agreement. It seems desirable to simplify^!t so~faras possible, and to eliminate the Government of India accounting departments and the India Office. We shall otherwise have endless difficulty over matters which are in no way our concern. The draft letter suggests a (jLa.\X\+*jL (M- procedUTe(^hXchr~wMle keeplng^lfKis Office in touch i with Y/hat is happening, will, it is hoped, save us from correspondence. A not inconsiderable burden is likely to fall on the Residents subordinate staff, and it may be necessary once the Agreement comes into force to consider some addition to it. But it is unnecessary to examine that point now. In view of the urgency of the matter, the Government of India might be asked to authorise on behalf of the Air Ministry an immediate ppj’s'k advance to the Resident of Rs.10,000, the general question of future procedure being left for settlement separately. 35a 3000 5 31 6 .draft Draft letter to the Air Ministry, with a tele g^^W^ 1 ir^OTerment of india and Political Rea dent, is submitted for approval.Draft Paper.

As reported therein I have jpust spent three days at Shargah. I met Colonel Day, Chief Engineer, Iraq Command, there and we discussed the arrangements that should be made for Hie construction of the rest houseo According to the instructions he had received from the Air Ministry it was proposed that the rest house should be built by him out of Air Force funds. We came to the conclusion, however, that it would be preferable that the building should be constructed by tiz: the Shaikh and that he should receive rent for it as originally contemplated by me. In the first place it would in any case be necessary to work through the Shaikh, The rest house will be built of stone and cement and the stone is only procurable from the islands off the Trucial Coast, It is necessary therefore to get the Shaikh to send out boats to fetch the stone and also to supply the requisite labour, transport, etc. Any outside contractor i© uld find very great difficulty in arranging this. • ! U3 . further, on political grou^B I consiaer it Yer y much preferable that the houee should he huilt hy xhe Shaihh a«i he his property, rather than that the Bri tish Government should huild a fort in his territory. As His Majesty's Government are a*are, the Snaihhs of tll e Trucial Coast are very apprehensive lest the estab- lishment of the air station should involve the loss of interference in their internal their independence and interrerem. -.,, ildine -which it is proposed to con- affairs. The ouildit-g nest house such as exists at struct is not an ordinary r Stoito or at Jash hut may much more aptly be describes as a large fort ,ith ,atch towers, para^ts, firing step , loopholes, etc, A building of this nature^ constructed hy the British Government on the Shaikh t tti-ink definitely increase his territory would, I t&amp;mk, dexi ^ -it is much better that the iii apprehensions and it is muon ing should belong to him. 4 Chief Engineer informed me that while * „ ve t been drawn up, it '&gt;&lt;» oalcuia- accunate estimate had yet been ^ Bow t the cost would not be less than i \ ted tlxat tiie building , finance the construction tlie shailda cannot fi British . le i recommend, therefore, that the on this scale. 1 * as he may require ! ^ advance him such sums as ne 1 Government shou - - ohiet engineer ; +.

It will, of course, be essential to keep the Shaikh with some money in hand. The site for the rest house was selected by the Ghief Engineer in consultation with Lieutenant Commander Galpin of Imperial Airways, a re present at ive of the Royal Air Jbrce and Commander Harding, R.M. it is on the edge of the aerodrome so that machines will taxi straight into a barbed wire enclosure adjoining the rest house* X went to Shargah hoping thatthere would be no difficulty in concluding a final agreement with the^* Shaikh. Unfortunately my expectations were not realised, and the Shaikh’s broths a, of whom he stands in great fear, were still maintaining an obstructive attitude, despite the fact that the Shaikh Jiad promised them a large portion of the subsidy. 6 . \4ry great pressure continues to be brought to bear on them from Debai to obstruct the establishment of the air station and the Residency Agent informs me that they receive daily four or five letters from Debai, urging them not to yield in this matter, while emissaries from Debai are constantly in Shargah to ascertain how matters are progressing. The motive that actuates the people of Debai is, I believe, the fear that they may lose the mail steamer. Debai was formerly a smaller place than Bhargah. It is now much larger and wealthier, simply and solely owing to the fact that the mail steamer calls there and it has become the emporium of the Trucial Coast. If the mail steamer called at Shargah instead there is little doubt that many/many of the Her chant 8 mould transfer their offices to Shargah. The Ruling family of Dehai derive a large income from house property, which would imn%iately xall m value. It is not unnatural, therefore, that the people of Debai should do their utmost to retain the mil steamer* The two points on which the discussions turned were, firstly, the guarantees regarding in dependence and non-interference and, secondly, the transfer ox the iaail steamer# I drafted a letter info lift ing the Shaikh in general terms that the British Government would respect hie independence and would not interfere in his internal affairs. He showed this to his relatives and they contended that this was inade- more explicit and detailed form, namely, that there should he no interference with his personal servants — male and female — or with his divers and that no one should he allowed to take refuge in the rest house, etc* To all these points I was prepared to agree and I had repeatedly assured the Shaikh that Imperial Airways were entirely a commercial concern and that their employes would have no official position and that in fact their position would he analogous to that of the British India Steam navigation Company^ representative at Dehai. The Shaikhly families of the Trucial Coast are, however, quite the stupidest people with whom it has ever been my misfortune to deal —a country yokel from a remote village in England or Scotland is a highly intelligent individual compared with a Trucial Shaikh,— and discussed for hours anong themselves as to whether the draft letter reitlly covered every conceivable point, etc.«ic* As an example of their mentality, I may mention Jfcjs*' that they asked me to declare that the aerodrome 'vsould be a civil one and not a military one. I enquired ■whether this meant that military aeroplanes could not land on it. They replied that this was not their intention at all hut that if #fc was declared to be a civil aerodrome then in the event of a war between Great Britain and l^rsia, the itersians would not be entitled to bomb it ] It will, I think, be realised that it is exceedingly difficult and wearing to the temper to argue with this type of mind. However, I had finally evolved a draft tfiich satisfied the shaikh, also a letter regarding the mail steamer in which I said I would address the Company regarding the possibility of the mail steamer calling at Shargah and would let him know the result, and he said he would show it to his brothers and come off on the 17th Morning to H.M.S. *Sh©reham H to sign the agreement. He arrived on board and said they wanted one or two verbal alterations in ! the letter of guarantee and further that they insisted that I should definitely undertake that the mail steamer should call at Shargah before he signed. I pointed out that it was quite impossible for me to give an under taking until I had referred the matter to the British ! India Steam navigation Company* Discussion ensued lasting several hours and finally the Shaikh burst into j tears and said he was pleading for his life and that if he signed without getting this undertaking he would certainly be murdered when he got ashore, lie a axe. that he had told his brothers that they had blackened his -ace and that he was ashamed to haggle with me in this manner and finally he said he was so wearied of the whole business/business that he would leave the town ard let them do as they pleased* Whether his fears are justified I do hi not know but there is not the smallest doubt that he is extremely apprehensive and having regard ta the frequency with which Shaikhs on the Crucial Coast are murdered by their relatives I think he would probably run some risk. In any case despite my assurances it was impossible to get him to affix his signature to the agreement. ©• As it was essential to avoid delay I told him that 1 would refer the matter of the mail steamer by telegram to the Government of India ami to Hi© Majesty’s Government and asked him whether in the meanwhile he would start collecting material. This he assured me he would do without any delay and 1 have asked the Residency Agent to keep him up to the mark, Further he said we could, of course, send an engineer down and start the work as soon as we liked and that he would be personally responsible for his safety, ihile therefore the inhabitants of the Truei&amp;l Coast cannot be expected to work with the rapidity of contractor# in more civilised places, especially at this time of the year when many of the boats are away pearling, I hope that by the time the representative of the Chief engineer arrives at Shargah a good deal of material will have been collected and that he will be able to make a start. It is essential, however, that the Shaikh should be provided with funds and I therefore solicit telegraphic sanction to the payment to him of Rs. 10,000* This money will be disbursed by the Residency Agent who will assure himself that the Shaikh actually is mending out boats, buying cement, etc* 9 , jf arrangements can be made for the mail steamersteamer either to pay an additional call at Shargah or to substitute Shargah for Debai as a port of call (the fomer course would be preferable if feasible), then there ought not to be any further difficulty in getting the Shaikh to sign an agreement even if his brothers should still prove obstructive, as I think there will be so much pressure by the people of Shargah that the brothers will be unable to resist it« should, however, this not be the case then we shall have to have resort to more drastic measures. The most influential of the Shaikh ? s brothers is Shaikh Muhammad, who is by the same mother and is a much more forceful personality# We can- not allow one man tcfotstruot the air route and overawe the inhabitants and to be a constant focus of unrest in Shargah, and should he persist in this attitude I think it will be necessary to deport him or order him JlVfW**'* *'{ i 1 to reside outside Shargah# 10 # I enclose herewith a translation of an agree ment which I hope the Shaikh will ultimately sign# It will be seen that I have increased the subsidy to Rs# ctfU+O 28,600# Of this increase Rs# is accounted for by the pay of ten additional guards# I consider that it is desirable to have 35 instead of 25 as originally contemplated; this increase is therefore automatic# The total amount payable for guards, therefore, now comes to Rs. 9,360# The rent for the rest house has been increased from Rs# 200 to Rs. 300 per mensem# The building is a large one and even making allowance for the fact that doors, windows, steel joists and corrugated iron sheets will be supplied by Government it will probably cost the Shaikh about Rs# 50,000. The rent therefore comes to about 7* on the outlay. This cannot be considered as excessive# He will however receive no rent for about ten years and if this is deducted ana also the/the wages of the guards the actual cash the shailch will receive in the near future will he only about CLAVYViLW , Rs« 15,000 per I do not think this amount is excessiveo fhe Shaikh will have to subsidize five relations as well as minor individuals and will also have to keep the beduin who levy blackmail on the Trucial Shaikhs quiet, ^here have been lately a great many oases of robberies on the Truoial Coast simply because the Shaikhs nowadays are not in the position to make to the beduin their customary payment, with the result that these latter gentry carry off camels and rob wayfarers and carry them off for sale into the interior. Onwe it is known that the shaikh of Shargah is in receipt of a subsidy from the British Government he will be regarded as the capitalist of the coast and the demands made on him will be greater than before. 11, The very day that I was at shargah 36 beduin had. come in to call on the Shaikh and it cost him Rs, 5 g and a square meal for the whole party to get rid of them and this state of affairs will increase. Moreover the Shaikh will very definitely have put a pledge in pawn, as any Badu who is not satisfied will be able to creep up to the vicinity of the rest house at night and fire a couple of shots somewhere in the direction of the g pr rest house, not with any idea of killing or injuring anyone but simply to get the Shaikh into hot water. This sort of incident, while probably not likely to do much harm, is certainly calculated to alarm passengers and is just the sort o thing that we want o avoid. I consider it essential, therefore, that the Shaikh should have funds t© enable him to satisfy his relatives and to keep these Beduin quiet. He himself fold me that for the first year or two at any rate ne would derive little personal benefit from the subsidy tad I think he is right, but if he can get the mail steamer then I do not thinjf ** ^ worry about this. Later on,on, when the air station is definitely established arxi accepted he will doubtless be able to relax his pay ments to some extent, and will derive some personal benefit« the agreement to 11 years, with the proviso that the Payments will only be made for such period as the facilities are utilised* fhe Shaikh pressed very strongly for this, and as I was anxious to make things easy for him and had been authorised to do so I accepted it* Personally I think it is in our interests, as I think that in 11 years* time, provided we do not interfere more than is absolutely necessary in the affairs of the Trucial Shaikhs in general and those of Shargah in particular, every Shaikh on the coast will be asking for the air station to be transferred to his • j domain, and it will be possiille/tc,reduce considerably payments to the Shaikh of Shargah* 12 * It will be seen that it is proposed to limit Political Resident in the Persian Gulfi bbafi &amp;QmmmT w^rnm shaikh sultan 3HITISH GOViSBfifMHHT 1*011 THE ESTABLISH- -1CENT OF AN AIR STATION AT SHAHOAI.

Tne agreement is to be modified in certain respects in accordance with the authority given to Sir Biscoe in the Secretary of State’s telegram Ho.1610 of 11th June on P.Z. 3383/32. In its present form it is on the general lines which had been anticipated. The payments made by us to the Shaikh will come to just over Rs. 20,000 per annum some Rs. 7,000 of which will be in respect of the pay of guards for the rest house. In addition the Shaikh will receive a landing fee of Rs.5 for each passenger aeroplane, no fee being charged to R.A.R.machines . 2. From the Resident’s telegram of 19th June on P.Z.3638/32, it will be seen that the Shaikh’s relations and people are insistent that arrangements should be made that the slow mail should call at Shargah and the Resident has promised to take the matter up. The Government of c India support the Resident’s recommendation in the matter. 3. The alternatives for consideration if we are to accede to the Shaikh’s request are to ask the B.I.S.U. Company to substitute Shargah for Debai as a port of call by the slow mail, or, if they are reluctant to do this, to endeavour to persuade them to make an additional call at Shargah. 4. The matter is not altogether free from difficulty. Shargah is of very little importance commercially and we are interested in it only because we have succeeded in getting there the air facilities we want. Dabai , on the other hand, is relatively a very important port. The B.O.T. Report on economic conditions in the Persian Gulf of April 1929 remarked that it was the next/next most important market for pearls after Bahrein, 'This port is rapidly rising in importance as a pearl centre hut it will he some years before it seriously .menaces Bahrein's premier position'. 5. It has also, as we know, an important smuggling trade with Persia and with the Arab hinterland. The decision to substitute Shargah for Debai would, one cannot help feeling, be likely to give rise to intense local feeling which might reflect itself in engineering disturbances in the Shargah Shaikhdom and possible attacks on the rest house, and it would seem preferable to compromise by endeavouring to secure an additional call at Shargah rather than substitution. 5. If it is agreed that we are to take the matte up with the B.I.Company, the most satisfactory course would probably be to address a personal request to Mr.Alexander Shaw, who is the new Chairman of the P. &amp; 0. and Companies. On the last occasion when a question of this nature arose (arranging for the fast mail to call at Bahrein in the event of the Residency being transferred to that Principality) a personal a.ppeal wa.s ma.de to Lord Inchcape which proved successful. Perhaps the Under Secretary of State or Lord Lothian would be willing to write personally to Mr.Shaw, possibly on the general lines of the draft attached. 7. The proposals in the Resident’s telegram of 18th June, P.Z.3633/37, are under examination in the Air Ministry and a further submission will be made as soon as their views are received. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^; 'ij le Draft Paper.

LETTER. 29 JUN1952 As you may have seen^His Majesty’s Government, owing to the difficulties we have experienced in getting an extension of our existing permit for an air route operated hy Imperial Airways along the south coast of Persia, are considering transferring the air route to the Arab side of the Persian Gulf on the expiry of the present permit from Persia in the beginning of next October. The route we contemplate would run from Basra to Bahrein, from Bahrein on to Shargah on the Trucial Coast, and thence on to 3353fr and so to India. It is essential to the proper operation of the route that we should have a relief point somewhere in the Trucial area. As you know^the local Shaikhs are exceedingly difficult to deal with and very suspicious of any interference by Europeans in their affairs. 7/e had , in consequence, the utmost difficulty in persuading any of them us-B—p-r e s-sura-)-' t o agree to give us the facilities we want. But after lengthy negotiation we have now been successful in reaching an agreement with the Shaikh of Shargah. Shargah/Shargah has, however, made one stipulation in connection with the proposed grant of facilities and it is on this that 1 venture now to bother you. The slow mail at present at CC- 7 c ^ i an d has a not unimportant trade. Shargah insistently hegs that we should persuade the B.I.Steam Navigation Company to arrange that the mail shall either substitute Shargah for Debai as a port of call, or make an additional call at Shargah. We should not venture to trouble you about t/iis were it not because of the importance to us of securing the air facilities we want in this region and the fact that it is quite clear that great importance is attached locally to bringing Shargah more into touch with trade^J^wT^should be very grateful for any assistance you could give us. We realise that there may be objections to substituting Debai for Shargah. But would it be at all possible for '-ec- mail steamer to make an additional call at Shargah as suggested by the Shaikh ? Shargah obviously will became much more important with the developrent of the air route and it is not improbable that it may, though probably not for some time to any great extent, attract part of the trade which is at present handled by Debai/Draft Paper Department. Behai. ITo loss of freight would, of course be involved, as goods destined for Shargah are now unshipped at Debai and thence carried to Shargah under local arrangements.

With reference to your letter of the 10th instant (P.Z. 3383/32) to Peirse relative to the Sharjah Agreement, we have no remarks from the civil aviation standpoint on your proposed reply so far as it concerns the period of the Agreement. With regard to the restriction on the personnel, however, the position is that it will certainly be necessary for Imperial Airways, Ltd., to employ white personnel there at first in order to get the Station into proper working order. The Company would be prepared to limit these Europeans to two during the initial period and would endeavour to arrange eventually that the Station should be manned by Indians (or Eurasians). But white staff would even then be required to visit the Station from time to time for short periods for inspection or maintenance purposes. It seems to us that this position should be made clear, otherwise it might look as if the Company were acting in bad faith in keeping the Europeans there at all. and Rendell. J.C. Walton, Esq., M.C., India Office, S.W. 1. Bertram is on leave, but I discussed this point with Shelmerdine yesterday and he agreed with these remarks.

Dear Peirse, With reference to our conversation this morning, I enclose a draft telegram to the Government oa India and the Political Hesident which we are anxious to get off to-morrow if possible. On the whole our best course seems to be to try to get an agreement under which we dhall secure facilities ior sn incefinite period without any provision for d .termination by the Sheikh. But if it proves impossible to secure this we might fall back on 11 years. It will be essential in either case to secure that the subsidy shall be payable only while the facilities granted are being utilised. I am sending copies of this letter to Bertram end Rend el. Will you be so kind as to let me know, as soon as possible, whether you concur in the draft or whether you have any observations on it. Yours sincerely Crpt.

Vhe esidency Agent informed me that he wrote this letter of hie own iree will, and subsequently reputedly asked him when an officer of the Royal ir 'force was coming to inspect the creek# He added that he was in dire straits for money and was pawning his wife 4 &amp; Jewels to meet his domestic expenses. Jroup Captain uilch informed me that ***» H* went there the 2 s stated in my telegram referred to above i was dhfiukh■L VJ, «*2«» Shaikh was most anxious that Im should examine the creek and seemed very disappointed when told that it was unsuitable for flying boats* He even said that he would arrange for hie people to dredge the creek if this was in any way feasible, ana that if any expenditure ’was necessary lie would ask Government to advance him the money and recover it from the subsidy* finallyp when told that the creek could not be made suitable he lent Group Captain *elch a Ford car and asked Mm to have a look at landing ground a f and was very pleased whan infer mad that &amp; suitable aerodrome could be found at .harg&amp;h if it was considered desirable at any time to use land aachines* finally, when X went to Jhargah last aionth the chaikh was certainly most anxxous to accord facilities, and he merely asked that ha oho Id be given a little time to obtain the concurrence of hi® brothers* X think there is little doubt but that had 1 been able to remain longer i would have octained his signature to the document. inf or t unate ly 1 am dependent upon the courtesy of the denior B&amp;val Officer and the ioy&amp;l i- Force for transport and owing to uad weather l wao only able to spend two days at Ghargah instead of four or five as 1 originally contemplated# 3, It seems timt after my departure the inhabitante of Jebai ana, I think, also the otiaikh of ,(as-*l-/vJ»imh broucht strong opposition to bear through the shaikh's brothers against the grant of facilities. ihe inhabitants of &gt;ebai are very anxious that no facilities sno .Id be aoeorded to airoraft on this coast as they are very apprehensive lest the mil steamer should transfer its call from ,ebai to whatever place be used by Imperial airways. prosperity and growth of Jebai are entirely due to the fact that it is a P 0 - “ u '- o.-Ij- British India steamers. If, for instance, the umil steamer called ••* fcalled at Qhargah Instead, imny of the aeroimnts would transfer their offices to S&amp;ergafa. and ebai would cert airily lose a very large portion of its population and of its customs revenue* The opposition of the Shaikh of ia&amp;h needs no explanation* he lias consistently opposed the grant of air facilities and would, I think, particularly resent his brother Jow&amp;simi ihaikh acquiring:!®, large subsidy and becoming one of the wealthiest dhaikh* on the Trucial Coast* 4* ASiyhow, on the present occasion I imd protracted discussions both with the ih&amp;ikh and his brothers, and while the Shaikh was certainly anxious to accord facilities and obtain the subsidy, he informed me that lie co&gt;.,Iu not stand up single- handed against the opposition that had been raised* The Residency Agent informed me that he ^as chiefly afraid of his elder brother who lives in the same house as hs d -es - an arrangement which offers every opportunity for fratricide, wh*ch is so prevalent on the Trucial Coast* 1 did not succeed in obtaining the shaikh's concurrence but ended up by informing him that i considered his behaviour towards me was insulting; that he had spontaneously volunteered to afford facilities and that on the strength of his letter I had come down twice to discuss im tters with him and that for him now to turn round and say that he was not prepared to carry out his undertaking was absolutely unpardonable, and that we would now make such arrangements as seemed good to ua without further reference to him* 5* ie stated in my telegram 5o*243 of the 26th April 1962 the fact that the Shaikh has not agreed to accept responsibility does not, 1 think, in the ease of Shargah make any very great practical difference* i’rom the point of view of security bhargah is preferable to eitiier Jeb&amp;i or ,.as-al—hairaan* .firstly.Firstlyt it is the headquarters of the residency gent, which «i/ greatly facilities matters since he is in a position to engage -uards t erect buildings, or carry out any other work that is necesaary* It is preferable to :because it is well removed from the hill® at the end of the Muagueidum fen insula occupied by the Miihuh* Those gentry have proved troublesome in the past and uhen the ;;haikh of Kh&amp;eesb rebelled they put up some resistance arid fired at hie ;..aj esty 1 s fhips* ' it is safer timn £eb&amp;l because ^ebai is the shopping centre of that part of the world and many Bedouin and others from the interior come in there, and muraers and aaeaulte are not infrequent. Mr rgah on the other hand, is a small place, the entire population of which consists of divers, fishermen, etc* Few outsiders ever come to it and the only ^edufcin in the vicinity tne -ani Chi tab, and with their Shaikh the residency Ageist &amp; on friendly terms and if soioe of them are enlisted as guard® they are not likely to give any trouble* Finally, the aerodrome and the best site for a rest nouse at phargah are both to one side of the town, instead of behind the town as at ^ebai* 6. One difficulty with which X have been confronted during my negotiations baa been the uncertainty as to whether the air , oute was to be transferred or not. If the .haikh of ohar^ah or t.ny other shaikh had a reed to eXxord tac.iities and had incurred a certain amount of hostility from his brother ihaikhe an,, relations and the Air oute iiad not seen transferred and ue had not received a eubsiay, 1 th.nk he rfOuld have had a just cause of complaint. That paint, however, does not now arise. On the other hand X do think that if no steps are taken to e tab 11 ah a landing ground at Jhargah the political effect will be deplorable. ?h* Trueial ..halkha will then merely trunk that hey are in a position to refuse any request that we make to them. the .oyal air force are, 1 understand, anxious to establish • • •establish an aerodrome for land machines at Jh? rgah, and I would therefore strongly urge that steps should be taken to enable them to do so# Group Captain welefc entirely agrees with this view arid .has recommended to the Air Officer Cornmndiag that a flight of wapitis should b© sent down to Ohargah in the near future, and the usual landing ground marks put on the aerodrome. Fuel is available there and the landing ground* is a good one, except possibly after heavy rain* The fact that the flying boats have repeatedly landed recently at Gebai has had a most excellent offect since it has shown the people of Jebai that, at any rate as far as military machines are con cerned, we are prepared to ignore their likes and dislikes and the ihaikh of .Jebai in hi a own interest posts guards round the creek at night, and I think the people are beginning to wonder whether they would not have been bet -or advised to have tried to derive some profit from the presence of aeroplanes* They see that the presence of aeroplanes causes them no inconvenience of any kind and are beginning to realise that they have lost a considerable sum of money* If the same course is pursued at itaar^ah it will certainly pave the «*y for civil Machines and the ..haikh and his relatives, when they realise that aeroplanes are visiting their town, may probably again try to obtain some financial benefit therefrom* 7 # If on the other Imnd it |s proposed to transfer the Air i\eute at an early date, then it is essential that the aerodrome should be mrked out, while the preliminary visit of military aircraft will certainly have a very good efi ect* The Residency Agent could then be instructed to enlist the requisite number of guards, say thirty i^ve, and to umke a*.y arrangements regarding accosaaodation tiiat t^y be conaidcxed necessary* I # e * * ♦.^v r-' '• &lt; &gt; { ] ^ » V.; W ‘ &gt; - - L.. ; m CWF/5* Wins CIRCULATED) Prom D.£_P_JPiliLR 0 p telegram.

The A.M. are instructing the A.O.C., Iraq, to send a flight of Wapitis to Sharjah to show the flag, strengthen ( the hands of the Sheikh, and mark out the aerodrome, as recommended in Col. Biscoe’s telegrams of 5th and 13th May. This is the only step which is immediately required and possible., The plans for the resthouse are being sent out to Col. Biscoe by this week’s air mail. On receipt of them he will have to arrange (through the Sheikh, presumably) for its construction locally as regards all matters affecting contracts, material, labour supply, etc. He should act in consuluation with the A.O.C., Iraq, who is being instructed to maintain close liaison with him. The question whether the expert engineering supervision required is within the capacity of the Assistant imgineei at Bush ire, or whether it should be placed under the responsibility of the A.O.C., Iraq, is a matter which will have to be decided on receipt of the G. of I.*s reply to our telegram of 18th May. Mr. Bertram thought that the former course might be adopted, provided that no practical difficulties are involved owing to the Bushire engineer's dependence on the G. of I-sP.W.D., but the Air Staff are inclined to think that the job will in any case be beyond the capacity of the Assistant Engineer at Bushire.Pending completion of the construction of the resthouse, a temporary camp is contemplated for the accommodation of the personnel of the Hannibals and passengers during their stops at Sharjah. The recruitment of local guards should of course take place in time to provide for the security of the camp when the Hannibals begin to use the route. It might conceivably be necessary to provide guards before this date, for the protection of the work on the camp and the resthouse. The number ojj* guards required, and the date from which they should be provided, can be left to Col. Biscoe, in consultation with the A.O.C. It is understood that Lt.-Commander Galpin, on behalf of Imperial Airways, will be arriving in the Gulf shortly for consultation regarding arrangements for the route generally. The F.O. have had much recent correspondence with Mr. Hoare regarding the manner in which the latter should communicate to the Persian Govt, the decision to transfer the route. In making this communication he wou^d try to obtain a further and final extension of the Persian permit up to 1st October. Until we know the resist of this demarche . it is impossible to .say from what date the Hannibals will commence to use the route. If no extension is obtained from the Persian Govt., the transfer may take place before the camp is finished. At the last interdepartmental meeting I suggested that in communicating sanction of the transfer of the route, we might add an expression of H.M.G.’s appreciation of Col. Biscoe’s efforts.

The negotiations on the Trucial coast, v/hich have taken place at numerous places in succession, have been physically very difficult, because Col. Biscoe has no despatch vessel, can only occasionally utilise one of H.M. Ships, and thus has great difficulty in obtaining access to the Trucial coast. The Persian d p'.p. Govt, does not allow machines to go to Bushire m order to fly him, and failing a vessel, there is no accommodation at Sharjah except the Residency Agent's house, which is exceedingly primitive. On his last journey to Sharjah, Col. Biscoe had to go by mail steamer to Bahrein, to fly thence to Debai, to take H.M.S. 'Triad' thence to Sharjah, and subsequently back to Debai, whence he flew to Basra and took the mail back to Bushire. This journey illustrates the complexity of arrangements for his transport-AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, W.C.2. 23rd May, 1932.

The Chairman of the Ministerial Sub-Committee accordingly considers that, in view of the urgency of the situation, there is no question of deferring txie immediate action contemplated, pending the return of the First Lord of the Admiralty.

Since the S, of S. saw this file we have had Col, Biscoe’s express letter of 26th April (flag A), his telegrain received 7th May (flag B), the G. of Us telegram of 9th May (flag C), and the telegram from H.Q., R.A.F., Iraq, of 9th M a y (flag D). The express letter of 26th April amplifies the view expressed in Col. Biscoe’s telegram of the same date that, even if the Sheikh of Sharjah does not formally accept responsibility, he will co-operate in arrangements for protection, and that the practical result would therefore be nuch the same; the Sheikh would himself, Col. Biscoe thought, personally welcome having to yield to force majeure . W Col. Biscoe visited Sharjah again on 3rd May and took the action which he contemplated, i.e., he informed the Sheikh that, in view of the formal letter received from him last February offering to grant facilities, he cannot complain if we now proceed without his consent, and that we would therefore make the necessary arrangements ourselves. The Sheikh assured Col. Biscoe that there would be no opposition. Col. Biscoe, the S-N.O. and Group Captain Welsh are agreed that adequate security can be provided by the enlistment of guards (about which there will be no difficulty), since there is no risk of opposition by the people of Sharjah, and precautions are necessary rather against isolated marauders than against serious attacks; the fact that the headquarters of our Residency Agent are at Sharjah will make it easier to supervise/ -■-ysupervise the arrangements. The S.N.O* is prepared to station a sloop at Sharjah for the first few months. An informal meeting at the F.O. yesterday considered the final drafting of the memo, to be submitted to the Ministerial Committee. It was decided to add a paragraph 24 in the print, together with the recent telegrams as an annex. It is submitted that the S. of S. might express concurrence in the course of action recommended in para. 25 of the memo. 11 ’illO' « - ^ : 10*t© K.E. M COPY NO In juj.

Outline Record of Events. 1. AT their second meeting held on the 17th December, 1931, the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East of t re Committee of Imperial Defence agreed— “ (a) To accept an estimate of probable expenditure involved in the establishment of an air route along the Arabian Shore of the Persian u as follows :— (i) iVn initial capital cost of £17,000 to £20,000. nno (ii) A recurring cash expenditure for the first two years of £15,000 to £17,000 per annum on operating charges. (in) In later years an annual expenditure of from £25,000 to S-AOOO per annum, including allowance for extra obsolescence. (If t e section Basrah to Karachi is closed to Imperial Airways the net compensation payable might amount to £30,000 per annum.) (I,) That the Air Ministry should be authorised to sanction the despatch by Iniperial Airways of an officer to make a complete and detailed surv . of a civil air route along the Arabian Shore of the ersian ' - , ■ (c) That as regard! the proposals of the Air Ministry for the erection of a rest house, etc. :— (i) Nothing should be done until further information is received from 1 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the xAir Ofhcei (ii) On C Spt d lf^uclTlnformation the Air Ministry should consult ' ° the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Treasury and the India Office and when inter-departmental agreement has been reac &lt;■ immediate measures for the construction of a rest house should be put in hand.” r 69811 BThis proposal involved the use by Imperial Airways of three 3-engined “ Calcutta” flying-boats in addition to three 4-engined “Hannibal” landplanes The new proposal is to make use of the four 4-engined “ Hannibal ” land- planes at present in use on the route between Galilee and Karachi. 2. In order to give effect to the decision of the Ministerial Sub-Committee quoted at 1 (b), above, Imperial Airways, Ltd., sent Lieut.-Commander B. W. Galpin, R.N. (Retired), to the Persian Gulf to make a general survey of a flying-boat route along the Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulf. 3. The conclusions of the Ministerial Sub-Committee at 1 (a) above were based on proposals for operating the Persian Gulf section of the England-India air service with a night stop at Ras-al-Khaimah. On the 20th December, 1931, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported the failure of negotiations with the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah for the desired facilities, and said that he thought that it was useless to make further efforts there, as the Sheikh, although himself showing some disposition to come to terms, was powerless in face of local opposition. Negotiations were then begun with the Sheikh of Debai, with a view to using Debai instead of Ras-al-Khaimah as the night stopping place on the Arabian coast. The Political Resident reported, however, that the Sheikh of Debai was also unwilling to accept responsibility for affording the desired facilities to Imperial Airways, Limited. 4. It therefore became necessary to consider further alternative proposals. Of these, the most promising was to use “ Calcutta ” flying boats on the route Bahrein-Yas Island (night stop)—Ras-al-Khaimah (for refuelling only)-Gwadar (night stop). t his proposal involved the provision of a boat or yacht for use as a depot and for the accommodation of passengers overnight at Yas Island, and the construction of a rest house at Gwadar, as well as refuelling facilities at Ras-al-Khaimah. The Political Resident did not anticipate that there would be any opposition to the use of Ras-al-Khaimah for refuelling in daylight, but the possible necessity in emergency of using Ras-al-Khaimah as a night stop could not entirely be excluded. 5. Y ith reference to the estimate accepted by the Ministerial Sub-Committee (see paragraph 1 (a) above), a revised approximate estimate was submitted by Imperial Airways, giving the additional annual cost to the Company and the initial capital expenditure as follows :— Revised Approximate Estimate of Additional Annual Cost of Operating from Bahrein to Karachi, with Calcutta Flying-Boats, following the A rabian Coast. £ Additional cost consequent upon additional mileage ... 2,860 Additional insurance due to salvage difficulties ... ... 1,800 Additional cost of crews and other staffs due to the divided route ••• ••• ... ... ... ... 8,101 Additional cost of premises at Karachi ... ... ... 500 Additional cost of maintenance and repair of plant and equipment ... ... ... 825 Additional cost of delivering fuel and supplies to Bahrein, Yas Island, Dibbah and Ras-al-Khaimah ... ... 2,500 Maintenance of Depot Ship at Yas Island (approximate) ... 7,000 Contingencies, 10 per cent, on total 23,586 2,358Revised Approximate Estimate of Initial Capital Expenditure. Delivery of aircraft ... ... ... ... 3,500 Delivery of equipment and transfer of staff ... ... 1,500 Motor boats, moorings and fuel barges ... ... ... 3.000 Slipways at Karachi and Bahrein ... ... ... B500 Plant and engine repair and shop equipment ... ... 2,000 Temporary rest house at Gwadar, with sleeping accommoda tion in tents, complete with furniture, lighting plant and equipment ... ... ... ...' ... 2,000 Additional cost of permanent quarters at Gwadar... ... 2^500 Depot ship, delivered Yas Island, approximately ... ... 12^500 28,500 Note.— No allowance was made in the foregoing estimates for the eventual replacement of the Calcutta Flying Boats, which will have to be taken into account if the route is operated permanently. 6. Owing to the failure of the negotiations with the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Debai a meeting was held at the Air Ministry on the 15th February, 1932, to consider these proposals further. At this meeting the Foreign Office representative stated that a telegram had been received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in which he gave it as his opinion that so long as the Minister of Court believed in the likelihood of a settlement of the general Treaty negotiations Imperial Airways, Ltd., would probably be allowed to continue to utilise the present South Persian route. 7. The need therefore for making arrangements for the operation of the service by the Arabian coast route as from the 1st April, 1932, no longer appeared to be so^ urgent. Subsequently Persian permission for the operation of the Persian route by Imperial Airways was extended from the 31st March, 1932, to the 31st May, 1932. The telegram, dated the 29th February, from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran was as follows: “Permission for Imperial Airways extended until the end of May. Minister has promised to consider terms of new agreement in anticipation of general settlement.’’ Naturally both the Treasury and the Air Ministry were anxious that expenditure should not be incurred on the purchase of a yacht for Yas Island unless this became a necessity. 8. On the 10th March Imperial Airways reported that they had received a cable from Commander Galpin saying that he was investigating the possibilities of using a land aerodrome at Dibbah on the east coast of the Oman Peninsula, as he thought that an excellent land aerodrome could be found there for use by a landplane service. The Sheikh there was reported as friendly. Dibbah has now been surveyed and found to be technically less suitable than Sharjah, on the Trucial coast about 10 miles north of Debai. 9. On the 15th March the Foreign Office informed the Air Ministry that the Persian position was, according to reports received from Tern an, ecoming worse. The urgent need for making some arrangement for operation y mpena Airways down the Arabian coast of the Gulf as from the 1st June, , i e air service to India was not to be temporarily stopped, became appaien . ew Proposal—to use Landplanes. 10. At a meeting held at the Air Ministry on the 21st Marcl^ Imperial irways developed a new proposal to use their fleet o engine ndplanes along the Arabian coast all the way to Karac i. 11. The Air Ministry were naturally surprised at oposal being brought forward-by Imperial Airways, •&gt; it the following advantages were at once obvious . (a) The same landplanes as already operated to \ a n r ^b^ e Ul a nd7“evS (V) The change-over could be made at rela « vel y at a future dLte to the Persian coast could take place at once, if at a future date Persian permission was obtained. [6981] B(c) The existing time-table of the service to India could be maintained. (d) The additional expenditure would be very much less than that previously considered unavoidable. ; / ^ ^ ^ t r ; ; i (e) The depreciation charge, amounting to at least £7,500 per annum per machine, on two machines would be avoided. 12. The revised estimate by Imperial Airways, which can be compared witP • 1 that given above, is as follows :— ‘ ‘ Hannibal ’ ’ 4-engined Landplanes. Additional Annual Expenditure. Cost of additional mileage by regular service Insurance Additional delivery costs fuel and oil and supplies ... £ 2,000 1,300 1,800 Capital Expenditure. 5,100 Transfer of equipment and staff from Bushire, Lingeh and Jask to Bahrein, Yas and Sharjah ... ... ... 750 Transfer of wireless from Bushire to Bahrein and from Jask to Sharjah ... ... ... ... ... 1,000 Moorings ... ... ... ... ... ... 500 Rest House at Sharjah (assuming in all respects similar to that proposed at Ras-al-Khaimah) ... ... ... 5,500 Preparation of aerodrome at Sharjah (impossible to obtain any degree of accuracy and this is, therefore, pure conjecture, but it should not exceed) ... ... ... ... 2,000 Total ... ... ... ... ... 9,750 In submitting these figures, Imperial Airways explain that they are given to the best of their knowledge and belief and are as close as they can reasonably be estimated at this stage. 13. Attention may also be drawn to the fact that the operation of land- planes could be effected by the 4 ‘ c Hannibals ’ ’ at present employed by Imperial Airways, Ltd., on the service to India, whereas operation by seaplanes as previously proposed, would involve the use of 3 of the “Hannibals” and 3 Calcuttas ; i.e., 6 as against 4 aircraft. As each “Calcutta” involves an annual depreciation charge of approximately £7,500, this fact alone would eventually show a saving of some £15,000 a year in depreciation charges. .on ^ ^ m P e) Tal Airways use landplanes instead of seaplanes, the route followed would be :— Basrah-Bahrein ... ... 345 Bahrein-Sharjah ... ... 305 (or Bahrein-Yas Island, 185 miles. Yas Island- Sharjah 185 miles.) bharjah to Gwadar ... ... ... 440 Gwadar to Karachi ... ... 305 Aircraft would refuel at Bahrein (and if necessary at Yas Island) and a mgi stop on the Arabian coast would only be made at Sharjah. Tx ^ The Air Ministry and the Treasury are impressed by the advantages Oiered by this proposal which would become possible by the provision of the required night stopping station at Sharjah. 16. The new proposal was examined by the Middle East Standing (Official) bub-Committee on the 5th April.‘ Departmental Observations on the New Proposal. 17. The majority of the Committee were generally in favour of the adoption of the landplane service, but since, in the view of the Foreign Office, there are •considerable political objections to the use of landplanes. that Department feels hound to draw attention to them, so that Ministers may clearly realise and fully T ept all the implications before determining on the course proposed. Foreign Office Criticisms and Air Ministry Remarks thereon. {X) Persian Risk. 18. This applies mainly to the stretch between the Oman Peninsula and Gwadar. Although it is proposed that the landplanes should fly outside Persian territorial waters, it is clear that any emergency landing would have to be effected on Persian soil. As the Persians will have definitely refused to permit Imperial Airways to continue to use and to fly over Persian territory, any landing made on Persian soil would probably lead to grave complications. Were the service to be operated by flying boats, a minor defect could perhaps be rectified by a descent in the open sea, and even if it were necessary to alight in Persian waters, it would at least be obvious that a serious attempt had been made to avoid using Persian territory. On the other hand, a landplane service pre supposes the eventuality of utilising for emergency landings the territory of the States over which it is operated, and the Persian Government would probably consider, more especially if emergency landings had to be made in Persia, that Imperial Airways were merely attempting to evade by a subterfuge their refusal to continue to grant the desired permission. In these circumstances emergency landings might even lead to the confiscation of the aircraft and possibly the arrest of the pilots and/or passengers, and a diplomatic situation of considerable difficulty would probably arise. On the other hand, the Air Ministry contend that His Majesty’s Government will have complied with Persia's request by removing from her territory the air route to which she took exception; that the type of aircraft used is no business of Persia and that in any case, whether land or seaplanes, they will fly outside territorial limits. In connection with the risk of emergency landing on Persian soil or Persian waters it is contended that these risks are lessened by using a 4-engined landplane in place of a 3-engined seaplane with the same type of engine and that, in fact, the chance of a landing in Persian territory is remote. It is further pointed out that the state of the sea off the Persian coast is usually such as to render it impracticable for a seaplane to alight outside territorial limits to effect minor repairs and that, in fact, a seaplane alighting for this purpose would, of necessity, seek refuge within territorial waters under the lee of the land. Although apart from the rights conferred by the International Air Navigation Convention in respect of casual flights by civil aircraft, the position of aircraft differs from that of merchant shipping in that unauthorised flight over the territory of another State would be an infringement of the sovereignty of that State, the Air Ministry take the view that Persia, who is herself, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, a party to the Air Naviga tion Convention, could hardly so far ignore the dictates of common humanity and international courtesy as to arrest the crew or confiscate an aircraft landing in distress on her territory. It is further contended that Persia could easily maintain that Imperial Airways were relying on her territorial waters and that, therefore, in law and practice, the case of the aeroplane and that of the flying boat landing through force majeure within Persian territory or territorial waters would be identical. (B) Trucial Coast. 19. In the case of landplanes, any emergency landing on the Trucial Coast would probably have to be made among wild and hostile tribes, wheieas m e case of flying boats emergency landings could be made, either within reach, o shipping or, at any rate, sufficiently far from the shore not to be exposed to the hostility of the natives. Were an emergency landing to be made among a hostile tribe and a disaster to result, the despatch of a rescue or punitive expedition might be necessitated, and involve expenditure on a far larger scale than anythingti contemplated in connection with the actual institution and operation of the* service. The Air Ministry counter-argument here is that the risks of a voluntary landing fall into two categories (a) Those due to engine and mechanical failure. (b) Those due to adverse weather conditions. In regard to (a), the Air Ministry are of opinion that this is lessened by using 4-engined landplanes in place of 3-engined seaplanes. The former should, in emergency, have sufficient reserve power to return to their starting point or land at some safe emergency landing ground, such as Yas Island, or on the coast within some friendly sheikhdom, such as Sharjah. The contingency that a landing might be made amongst hostile tribes is ever present as a remote contingency in any air route, and is not excluded by the use of seaplanes. As a matter of fact, Imperial Airways have experienced between Basra and Karachi with their land- planes no forced landing through engine or mechanical failure during the past two years. In regard to (b), if adverse weather is encountered, it is contended that both the seaplane and the landplane should be able to return to their respective starting points. Under the former proposal the seaplanes were to have a refuelling stop at Ras-al-Khaimah on the Trucial coast, whilst under the new proposal, the land- planes would make their night halt at Sharjah, in comparatively friendly territory. Should adverse weather enforce a postponement of departure from these places, the landplane would, in the opinion of the Air Ministry, be secure at Sharjah, but the seaplane has perforce to remain in territory belonging to a sheikh who is neither friendly nor willing to offer protection to the crew from neighbouring tribesmen. The risk, therefore, to which the Foreign Office draw attention, albeit remote, appears to be increased by the use of seaplanes whilst refuelling at Ras-al-Khaimah, since delays of 24 hours have been experienced there by Service aircraft due to sand storms and strong shamal winds, and also to adverse weather reports from the next stopping place. /' mi Gulf in t ■ m irrespecti | itlisraituali 1 1 tie route t ; atally elir lie Air M •lid C cease (C) Difficulties connected with the Possible Operation of the Arabian Route by Foreign Air Service. 20. When the question of the Arabian Air Route was considered in the summer of 1931, it was agreed that if the proposed service were operated by flying boats, the danger of the French and Dutch attempting to operate it would be small, since neither the French nor the Dutch at present use or are likely to construct flying boats of the required type, and it would be possible to reply to any applications which they might make to His Majesty’s Government for permission to use the route by explaining that His Majesty’s Government had not even allowed their own companies to use landplanes owdng to the risks involved. If, on the other hand, a British landplane service is instituted, it will be practically impossible to prevent the French and Dutch services (which at present use three-engined machines, but have a very wide radius), to use the mnding ground at Sharjah, and probably also that at Bahrein. This would mean— (a) That foreigners would obtain a footing on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf (which it has hitherto been the policy of the Government of India strongly to oppose). (b) That the risks of trouble with the native inhabitants contemplated in section (B) above would be very greatly increased. \ c ) That ve should either (i) be committed to the protection of the French and Dutch and possibly other foreign companies in emergencies, and should therefore find that the danger of our having to undertake an expensive rescue or punitive expedition was greatly increased; or (ii) if we refused to accept this obligation, we should be obliged to acquiesce in the foreign Governments concerned taking their own measures for the protection of their nationals, which might lead to the i'fji I Last; ow lik founds H ,? O' All’ll: ® the' &gt; 'Is ti ^indut anappearance of foreign warships or other forces on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, it should be remembered that the Trucial coast is not a British Colony and that our policy hitherto has been not to assume any responsibility for its internal affairs, but merely to keep out all other foreign interests. Considerations which, m the opinion of the Air Ministry, modify this view are as follows. The French and the Dutch will not be content to accept permanent inter ruption of their air routes, which are of the same importance to them as Imperial Airways' route is to us. Owing to the nature of their organisations and lack of facilities in the Gulf, it is almost out of the question that they can operate sea planes. They will inevitably ask for permission to use landplanes on the Arab route. They will support their request by showing that the endurance of their aircraft is such as to make them'independent of any landing grounds on the Trucial coast or Oman Peninsula and that a stage from Bahrein to Gwadar would take them along the Persian coast. Such a request, even if we were in the mean time using flying boats, would be extremely difficult if not impossible to refuse, particularly as reciprocity is an essential part of our civil air policy; for example, we shall be dependent on Dutch goodwill to establish our projected air-mail route to Australia. If a landplane route is accepted for Imperial Airways, there is a general feeling that the use by foreign civil air lines of landplanes on the Arab route cannot be avoided although the Air Ministry suggest that conditions of operation could be imposed which would exclude the possibility of foreign aircraft making emergency landings in territory other than Persian. It is argued, moreover, that the development of civil international aviation will compel us to regard the Persian Gulf in the not distant future as an international airway flown by land planes irrespective of the type of aircraft we have ourselves chosen. In this eventuality it appears fairly certain that practical considerations will cause the route to follow the Persian rather than the Trucial coast and thus automatically eliminate the risk of forced landings on the latter. The Air Ministry therefore contend that the Foreign Office objections A. B and C cease to apply. ■(D) Nejd. 21. Last autumn His Majesty’s Government abandoned any f urther attempt to obtain from Ibn Saud facilities for the operation of a British landplane service over his territory, as the Foreign Office were informed that Imperial Airways had decided against the use of landplanes in favour of the use of flying- boats to be operated outside territorial waters. Negotiations were, however, still carried on with a view to obtaining Ibn Sand’s consent for the R.A.F. to demarcate three emergency landing grounds between Koweit and Bahrein. Ibn Saud’s recent attitude has not been unfriendly to this project, and should agreement be reached there is little reason to suppose Ibn Saud’s treatment of a civil aeroplane in distress making use of one of these landing grounds would be different from that accorded to a Service airciath The Air Ministry consider that in the remote event of a 4-engined Hannibal landing on the Hasa coast before any arrangement with Ibn Sand has been concluded, its treatment would presumably be the same as that likely to be accorded to an R.A.F. aircraft in similar circumstances. This is admittedly uncertain, but unlikely to result in any regrettable incident. India Office Observations. 22. The India Office consider that, while the risks enumerated above must be recognised, they are not so serious that they need be held to outweig le advantages claimed for the “Hannibal” type of land aircraft over the Calcutta Tying-boats from the financial, commercial and technical pom s o view. 8 regards paragraph 19, they feel that the risk of hostile action by tribesmen m8 the event of an emergency landing on the Trucial Coast is perhaps over-estimated by the Foreign Office. The area in question is almost entirely desert, with a few scattered hamlets belonging to the Trucial Sheikhdoms along the coast. The risk that the subjects of these Sheikhs would take hostile advantage of an emergency landing is very much less than would be the risk of a prepared attack on a regular night stopping place established on the Trucial Coast without adequate arran. 5 ^ .r; merits for protection, if it w T ere proposed to establish a night stop under sucfi conditions (which is, of course, not the case). Nor does the risk of hostile action by wandering Bedouin, in the case of an emergency landing, seem to be very extensive in this sparsely inhabited area. As regards paragraph 20, the possibility of political difficulties arising if foreign aircraft are allowed to operate the Arabian route is recognised. The question whether such operation should be allowed is one which will have to be considered in due course. When the time comes for a decision, it might, from the local political point of view, be preferable if possible for His Majesty's Government to endeavour to exclude foreign aircraft, relying on the exclusive nature of our treaty relations with the Trucial Sheikhs; if, however, this should not prove possible, it would seem desirable to explain the position frankly to the foreign Governments concerned, with a view to their taking all the precautions against the risk of emergency landings by their own aircraft, which we propose to take in the case of British aircraft. If, none the less, an emergency landing by a foreign aircraft should lead to trouble with the native inhabitants, we should no doubt have to take measures to protect or rescue the crew and passengers, rather than acquiesce in the foreign Government concerned taking such measures (an alternative wffiich can hardly be contemplated). But this contingent risk, though its existence may be recognised, does not appear to be one which need be held to weigh very heavily at present against the adoption of the proposal to operate the British air route by land aircraft. 23. The Admiralty are in general agreement with the view’s expressed by the Foreign Office as to the risks described in paragraphs 19 and 20, and especially with those set out at (a), (b) and (c) of the latter paragraph. Further, v hile appreciating the substantial advantages attaching to the successful employ- nient of land planes on the Arab coast civil air route, the Admiralty consider it desirable that attention should be directed to the facts, (a) that, no matter how reliable the aircraft, some additional risk must of necessity be incurred if land planes are regularly used instead of sea planes for flights over the open sea in an area in which there is comparatively little shipping; and (b) as is shown in t ^ e A mmediatel y following paragraph, it would appear necessary to allocate one Ma .l est y s sloops in the Persian Gulf to the dutv of affording protection at bharjah during the next few months. 2-k Since consideration of this question by the Middle East Official Sub Gommittee on the 5th April last. Lt.-Col. Biscoe, the Political Besident in uie i ersian Gulf, has been in negotiation with the Sheikh of Sharjah, with tiie result indicated in a telegram received on the 7th May, a copy of which m aitaehed (Annexure A). The view’s of the Government of India and of the G, 11 Officer Commanding in Iraq on the situation resulting from Lt.-Col. iscoe s negotiations wuth the Sheikh of Sharjah are given in the two telegrams or tne 9th May, copies of which are also attached (Annexures B and C). These telegrams indicate the practicability of establishing a night stopping station for and pianes at Sharjah, although certain further arrangements will be required m oi der to afford adequate security, particularly the enlisting of a small force of local guards, and the stationing at Sharjah during the next few months of one of His Majesty’s sloops.

I arrived at Shargah, the 3rd May, and have had protracted discussions with the Sheikh and his brothers. Latter appear to have been got at by interested persons in Dibai and to have organised opposition, and, while I still think that the Sheikh is himself anxious to afford facilities, he states that he cannot withstand the opposition. I have informed him that, in view of the fact that he wrote formal letter to me agreeing to afford facilities, he cannot complain if we now proceed without his consent, and we will, therefore, make any arrange ments that may be necessary ourselves and he will not be given subsidy. He assured me that there would be no opposition. 3. If air route is not transferred to (? this) side and no steps taken to establish landing ground at Shargah, political effect will be very bad, as Trucial Chiefs will consider that the opposition they have shown during the last five months has been entirely successful, and can always be repeated on future occasions. Welch and I are therefore of opinion that (? a) flight of Wapitis should be sent here at an early date and should land at Shargah for a few hours, and some marks should be put on aerodrome by Residency Agent. 4. If air route is transferred, then, in addition, Residency Agent should be instructed to enlist requisite number of guards : 30 or 40 would be sufficient. There will be no difficulty about enlisting any number considered desirable. Senior Naval Officer, Welch, and I are agreed that this should provide adequate security. There is no risk of (? opposition) by the people of Shargah, and precautions are necessary rather against isolated marauders than against serious attacks. House surrounded by wall could also be built, or erected (if sent out in sections), by Residency (? Agent). Both house and aerodrome would be clear of village and under cover of naval guns. 1150.

The Sheikh of Sharjah had written a formal letter last February offering to grant facilities for aircraft, either flying boats or land machines. Colonel Biscoe was instructed on 8th April to proceed to Sharjah for preliminary negotiations. Colonel Biscoe has now paid two visits to Sharjah (his proceedings having been delayed by lack of transport). Though opposition to the Sheikh has been organised by his brothers, which the Sheikh says he cannot withstand, the latter is believed to be himself still anxious to afford facilities and not averse to having to yield to force ma ieure , so that the practical result is nuch the same as if he entered into a formal arrangement. Colonel Biscoe has accordingly informed him that we will make the necessary arrangements for a night stop at Sharjah ourselves. The Sheikh has given an assurance that there would be no opposition to us. The local political, naval and air authorities are agreed that adequate security can be provided by the enlistment of guards (about which there will be no difficulty) since there is no risk of opposition by the people of Sharj ah/Sharjah and precautions are necessary rather against isolated marauders than against serious attacks. The fact that the headquarters of our Residency Agent are at Sharjah will make it easier to supervise the arrangements.0 r $ \\ FCN/U C/LJ S/PJM/iWM * £ * - / '7 “ 7 , / 0 '0 IO o \ I ^ (B72 groups) ' % 2431 — P_P T £ f, E G R ft M {COPIES From CIRCULATED) PoXI’tlcEl Rsslclerrb in *tihp Persian Gulf to Foreign 9^vernment S of WpAunt*»£? repMtea'SJ 'TlVv Dated Received XXX ISr 7 o r 4 ^iMr 10 - 30 “•'■• NP-a,?.,*.?,?, Aclcir'6t*£j6cl iio ‘th© GovornnisQ'ti o £ xndi© B ^©pssftsd to Secretary oX istate lor India and Air Officer Coranandlng, BggMad.

On reconsideration your proposals appear to involve more direct commercial bargain than I had realised,. Objections to pa-ying direct commercial price for con tinuance of Imperial Airways’ permit - were scheme other wise practicable - are almost as serious as in the case of political price c It is settled policy of His Majesty’s Government not to admit principle that payment can be de manded by a country in return for permission to fly over its territory* Pact that continuance of Airways’ permit had been secured by virtual subsidy would under your pro posal become known. and create a. dangerous precedent risk- hig serious consoduenc.es elsewhere. Further complication nom extension of permit in return for subsidy would be mat foreign services might continue free use of route an our expense thus involving in fact discrimination against British service, Moreover s even if subsidy could be paid in so indirect a manner as to render those objections of principle less applicable, figures -which you now Quote introduce new ^rious difficulty which would almost certemnly prove in superable. Initial cost of transfer of Imperial Airways’ service to Arabian coast is unlikely to exceed u30 s CCO and nay .&lt; 3*0may amount, if land planes arc used, to less than £ 10 , 000 , while subsequent annual cost to his Majesty* s Governniont is expected to prove comparatively slight* Subsidy to Airwork to be effective would have to be very large, since, apart from making up dead loss on internal services of approximately £ 20,000 a year, it would be necessary to provide for Airwork profit* Further, if Persians regarded arrangement as equivalent to subsidy in return for con tinuance of Imperial Airwayfe* permit, they would probably impose conditions on Airwork involving greater rmining losses than those experienced by Junkers and increased subsidy. Even if satisfactory concession for Airwork to operate Persian internal services could be obtained by these means, we should merely have given Persian Govern ment another hostage in connexion with our Imperial com munications, as Persians could always utilise Airwork con cession to create difficulties for Imperial Airways, and connexion between two concessions would be likely to prove constant source of friction and difficulty. Offer of subsidy in any form for continuance of Imperial Airways* permit at this stage, even if disguised in manner proposed, would strengthen Persian conviction of our extreme anxiety to secure South Persian, permit and tnerefore encourage them to link that question more close ly with political negotiations. Only way to succeed in dissociating Air Route question from general political negotiations is by transferring noute to Arabian coast without delay* See my immediately following telegram* Repealed to India No c 9 0 u Pi s SAi f This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official nsfl.] mm persxa npercher.

Repeated to India No, 8 c1/ Under Secre tary of State, Colonel Biscoe’s telegram, which was received yesterday afternoon in time to be communicated to the interdepartmental conference on the Persian negotiations, is satisfactory so far as it goes, and indicates that the Sheikh of Sharjah will be prepared to grant the facilities desired if sufficient pressure is applied. The Air Ministry are, I understand, satisfied with the report as to security contained in paragraph 4 d Colonel Biscoe’s telegram, and steps will now be taken to bring the memorandum for submission to Ministers up to date. I understand from Mr» Bertram, however, that it is not proposed to submit the recommendations of the Official Sub-Committee to Ministers until Colonel Biscoe’s further report is received, but that arrangements are being proceeded with, in conjunction with Imperial Airways, to carry out the programme so far as possible in anticipation that the negotiations will be successful and that Ministerial sanction will be forthcoming.I have pointed out that Colonel Biscoe has not yet had authority to make a binding agreement with the Sheikh, and that his instructions remain,as indicated in our telegram of the 8th April (P.Z. 2175/32), as follows: 'Proposal to operate Arab route by land aircraft is not yet finally approved, but question is sufficiently far advanced for you to open preliminary negotiations.' It is true that in the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran of the 22nd April (P.Z. 2489/32), Mr. Hoare has been informed that 'transfer /of route to Arabian coasi7 will be made as soon as possible after Jlay 31st7\ but the Foreign Office have admitted that they have no specific Ministerial sanction for this, though they sent the telegram because there seemed to be no other practicable alternative to the transfer, failing a long-term extension of the permit for ohe Persian route, which could not be expected. I have made it plain to Mr. Bertram that in all these negotiations with the Sheikh of Sharjah the Government of India are in no way conmitted to any expenditure, that any agreement which Colonel Biscoe may eventually be authorised to conclude with the Sheikh would/would be between H.M.Gr., on behalf of Imperial Airways, and the Sheikh, and that, should it eventually be decided not to operate the Arab air route, the responsibility for making, good any payment to the Chief for the non-fulfilment of the contract would rest on Imperial revenues. He agreed that this was so, and that it would be desirable at some stage to put it into writing. I append a draft demi-official letter to Mr. Bertram with the object of having this understanding confirmed. 27. / v -ISPMHI ; { Q R K c 3°) m/vs/m&gt; (46 groupe) 2395, GIBCULATSD) Dated ^-1 G Y P,H B R OF TSLEGHAM .

The institu tion of a flying boat service, which had been provisionally sanctioned, has been held up owing to the new proposals of Imperial Airways for the operation of the service by land planes, and it now seems likely, from the course ol the -I discussions which have since taken place, that the objections _ j j to a flying boat, as opposed to a land plane, service may well prove overwhelming. But the whole scheme for the land plane service now d epends on our reaching some kind of settlement,*.. P.DOHALDSON Esq. n V' ' I ! It ii* I ,#! I i A ■■■■■W - 2 - settlement with the Sheikh of Sharjah, and until we know how we stand on this point the question cannot he put to Ministers. Time is already so short that it will he a matter of great difficulty to get the service going hy the required date. Any further delay therefore may have serious results. Moreover, the question of the Air Route has an important hearing on our general negotiations with Persia, which are unlikely to advance until the Air Route problem is disposed of. In these circumstances it is terribly disappointing that the Resident, owing to the difficulty of retaining H.M.S. 'Shoreham' and to his anxiety to catch the return mail to these Bushire, left/important negotiations with the Sheikh of Sharjah in a state of suspense. We know from ^experience that these .periods of reflection on the part of Trucial bheikhs seldom bring a settlement nearer. On the contrary, as in the case of the Sheikh of Debai, they are apt to give time to the Sheikh’s relatives and dependants to get together and bring pressure to bear on him to refuse the desired concession. In the circumstances there seems a real danger of Biscoe s^ premature.,,. 32 SECRET i*) HSVXBSD COPY (156 groups} 216' (COPISS cvmu D ?T fi p kl H p A W V A? E X&gt; il!

Negotiations were then begun with the Sheikh of Debai with a . w A using Debai instead of Ras-al-Khaimah as the night stopping Z? on the Arabian coast 0 The Political Resident reported, how- rpf that the Sheikh of Debai was also unwilling to accept responsi bility for affording the desired facilities to Imperial Airways, Ltd* It therefore, became necessary to consider further alternative sals Of these the most promising was to use ’’Calcutta” flying boats on the route Bahrein-Yas-Island (night stop)-Ras-al- Khaimah (for refuelling only) - Gwadar (night stop).. This proposal involved the provision of a boat or yacht for use a d er)ot and for the accommodation of passengers overnight at Yas Island and the construction of a rest house at Gwadar, as well as re fuelling facilities at Ras-al-Khaimah. The Political Resident di,t not anticipate that there would be any opposition to the use of Ras- al-Qiaimah for refuelling in daylight hut the possible necessity in emergency of using Ras-al-Khainah as a night stop could not entirely be exclude (L 5 With reference to the estimate accepted by the Ministerial Sub- Littee (see paragraph 1(a) above) a revised approximate estimate was submitted by Imperial Airways giving the additional annual cos to the Company and the initial capital expenditure as follows.

The Air Ministry counter~argiment here is that the risks of a voluntary landing fall into two categories :~ (a) These due to engine and mechanical failure, (b) Those due to adverse weather conditions. In regard to (a), the Air Ministry are of opinion that this is lessened by using 4 -engined landplanes in place of 3- engined seaplanes* The former should, in emergency, have sufficient reserve power to return to their starting point or land at some safe emergency landing ground such as Yas Island cr on the coast -within some friendly sheikhdom such as Sharjah* The contingency that a lending might be made amongst hostile tribes is ever present as a ^ remote contingency in any air route and is not excluded by the use ox seaplanes. As a matter of fact Imperial Airways have experienced between Basra and Karachi with their landplanes no forced landing through engine or mechanical failure during the past two years. In regard to (b) if adverse weather is encountered, it is contended that botn the seaplane and the landplane should be able to return to their respective starting points. bnder che former proposal the seaplanes were to have a refuelling stop at Ras-al-nnaim on the Trucial coast, whilst under the new proposal the lang?lanes would make their night halt at Sharjah in comparatively frien p territory. Should adverse weather enforce a postponement departure from these places, the landplane would in the opinion of the Air Ministry be secure at Sharjah, but the seaplane^has perforce to remain in territory belonging to a sheika who is^neither friendly nor willing to offer protection to the crew from neighbouring tribesmen. The risk, therefore, go which the Foreign Office dra, attention, albeit remote, appears to be increased by u ^ e ^ seaplanes whilst x»efuelling at Ras-a 1 -Khaiman., since delays of hours have been experienced there by Service aircrafc due to sand storms and strong shamal and also to advex se weather reports irom e next stopping place. 20 ( G ) Difficulties connected with the possible operation of t^e Arabian houte by foreign air services.

M.E.(O) 56 - Memorandum by Imperial Airways Ltd., giving a technical comparison of the Hannibal and Calcutta aircraft in relation to the Middle East air service via the Arabian coast. MB. KSNDHL 3 in opening, stated that the object of the meeting was to consider the proposal that had recently been put forward by Imperial Airways, and endorsed by the Air Ministry, to operate the air route along the Arabian coast with land-planes instead of with flying boats, as had previously been contemplated and agreed too the scheme now proposed was for the operation of the service by four-engined Hannibal land-planes, instead of three-engined Calcutta Hying coats, ana the advantages of the former over the latter, to Mnich attention had been drawn in the papers which h--d been oirculated, were to a large extent the natural advantagee of four over three engined aircraft. A- thought a distinction ought to he made between the comparison of 4 with 3 engined aircraft, and the comparison of land with sea planes. It was clear that the new proposal offered important financial and technical advantages. The whole proposal, however, still hinged on th question whether a landing ground and night stopping station could he established at Dibbah or Sharjah.s!&amp;£Uj GT. - A special reconnaisBance for this purpose was helug made h the Air Officer Commanding Iraq 3 hut it was unlikely that the 0^3 mnulred information would he :C nr the iming before the 7 th April at the very earliest. Until this was received no final con clusion could he reached* as the whole new proposal nj. ght he found to he impracticable 0 in preference to three-engined While the employment of four-engined/machines offered obvious advantages* the proposal to substitute land ’-planes for flying toats raised certain questions of a political nature* which would need careful consideration 0 For instance - (a) If a land-plane service were inaugurated it would be very difficult to refuse facilities to the French and Hatch air lines* who were in a position to operate a land plane though not a flying boat service and who would almost certainly ask pemission to use this route and any facilities that might he established* (b) The Foreign Office had always laid particular stress on the importance of establishing an air route outside* and in no way dependent on the use ? ei Persian territory* in order that we might he ahle to show the Persian C-overnmen^ that we were in no way dependent on them for the main tenance cf our air service to Ind^a© He considered that an emergency landing ty a land 'plane en Persian soil, such as might occur on the stage rihtatv-Gv/adar, would he likely to involve serious complications with Persia. The possibility of the Persians confiscating any such aircraft and arresting the passengers and crew was a contingency that might well occur. Should, however, a flying boat descend at sea and shelter on the Persian Coast he thought that the Persians Q q -i-rip -incident would clearly less likely to prove unr&amp;s$onat,j-^ s-^ le in the nature of a cao© of shipwre^Uo , . ohm 1 Id first discuss the Ke proposed that the meeting snouia . ^ -i-ino-G r* or Rider the poritioal technical aspect of the question* an and other implications involved, • iv-'p vi ews of Xmpei ial COLONEL SHELhlF'KDlNE sai^ th.au t- - P -HHHHHMHHMMIHHHHIIIIIIIHHi p xr-Y, r ays were fully given in their letter nf the 23rcL March ? 1932 (Annexure B* MoS e (0) 53)* The great advantage accruing the use of four-engined Hannihal land planes was the fact that the existing time-table of the Eastern air service could he adhered to and there would not he a delay of one day which the use of flying ho ats would necessitate 0 The second advantage was that the estimated cost both of initiation and operation for four-enginedHannibal land planes would he much lower than for three-engined Calcutta flying boats® A third 5 and perhaps most important 9 fact was that $ as the Hannibals were on the spot and were already operating on the route along the Persian coast, they could be transferred at very short notice to the Arabian coast route® Should any further development occur, rendering a reversion to the Persian shore possible or advisable, a re—transfer to the Persian route could be effected with the minimum of expense and delay® He said that during the last two years machines of Imperial Airways, operating on the Basra - C-wadar sector, had made no forced landings due mechanical failure® One involuntary stop had been made in 1931 which v/as duo to a sand storm* MR® GRIEVE pointed out that the use of land planes on the sector Basra - Karachi would require, as at present, only four machines, v/hereas the flying boat service, as proposed, would necessitate the use of 2 extra machines, Ue, six in alio This meant that the adoption of the new proposal would permit not only a considerable reduction in running expenses but would also reduce tne cost of initiating the scheme and the neavy allowances depreciation which would have co de „»ad MS. BERTRAM, in reply to a question by aaptain Cunningham, said that the intention was to operate the I - 3 - Mil \l4 ]-nd plane service direct from Bahrein to Di/bah, and that a diversion hy Yas Island would only be made occasionally when weather conditions rendered the use of such a route advisable, (Mr 0 Woods Humphery and Colonel Burchall of Imperial Airways then entered ) 0 HiRo WOO IB HUMPHERY stated that Imperial Airways had nothing further to add to the proposal as contained in Annexure B of Paper No. LLE, (0) 53, Both from a teclinical and commercial point of view (as distinct from, the political and risk point of view) the advantage of the four-engined Hannibal ’plane over the three -engined Calcutta flying boat was overwhelming. In reply to a question as to the comparative risks involved* he expressed the opinion that the four-‘■engined HannYbal ^.and plane was no mere dangerous than the tbree-engxned Calcutta fly ing boat, as there was considerably less chance of a lorced landing, Calcutta flying boats are able to all gilt on the sea ? tut they will not remain afloat indefinitely in rough water* and in any case they must make port without help or be reached by a rescue vessel,., He stated that Imperial Airways would not be greatly con cerned if the French and Butch air lines were permuted to operate a land plane service along the Arabian Coast* since they already had the competition of these two Companies while operating along the Persian Coast* Imperial Airways had hitherto accepted the ruling that a flying boat service should be operated along the Arabian Coast on the understanding that flying boats would be per mitted to go to Ras~e 1 -IChaimah* whereas land ’planes would not. Up to that time it had been assumed that land ’planes must fly 4 -v,^ -iexperience ox the most modern normally over land, Y/utn the lauex i+ wa S thought that the objection to four-engineo. land aircraft* vetb ^ „ . oo™/-vrOane was greatly reduced* anci* flying over the sea wx uh an a-., op^en since there was now difficulty over the use of even flying boats at Ras-el-Khaimah and thex'e appeared to he tne poos^oi^it.prcrr dinp s. land as no drome at Dil)ali ? tlie use of land aircraft should be considered afresh* He had not hitherto been a^are that a landing ground at Siiarjah, as an alternative to that at Dibah, was under con sideration, and this seems to have been suggested subsequently to the proposal to use Dibaho In the circumstances as they are P Imperial Airvays wou.*,d prefer, on commercial grounds, to operate a service with the four-enginod Hannibal land 'planes than with three-engined Calcutta flying boats, provided some suitable landing ground were found in the vicinity of the Musandam Peninsula, In reply to a question by Mi*. Rondel, he said that he did not consider that there was much difference in the catastrophic risk involved by che use of four-engined land 'planes with their high reliability, but inability to float if they nad to come down on the water, and tho oxiree x..,y t. ? , . , n-ivn ^ + n ro-.rip dnwr „ but were then ahle to which were more liable so come vU -? float, at anj r rate, for a time. It was agreed tint there were no four-engined flying boats available and they could not, therefore„ be considered for this particular purpose. As regards the risks involved by a flying boat landing on , , n 11 „.u T^rtprial Airways had lent one flying rough water, he stated that Imperial . i . 4 . -p,.- it difficult to evaluate the boat In such conditions, oat fu - risk involved with Calouttas in seas in the Persian Gulf, In reply to a question by Captain Cunningham, he stated that Imperial Airways had very little eu.ponenoo , . m u. on the sea in the event of a distance a flying boat cou.h . i-nt -in th 10 t emu era tunes prevailing in the forced landing y but h.n nr, ^ - , 4 &gt;iof could taxi far without Persian Gulf it was not expected that it con. the engines overheating. (ilr, Woods Humphery and Colonel Burchall then with drew )ogCAL ilSjfAPAR ! GROUP CAPTAIN PEiRSS expressed the view that the Persians might well regard the forced descent of a flying boat at sea* and its subsequent approach to the Persian shore, as a forced landing rather than a shipwreck MR* HENiHiL demurred and considered that flying boats, not being normally dependent on land, and consequently, on this stretch, on Persian territory, for any emergency landings, would be regarded by the Persians as a shipwreck and treated as such. On the other hand, land-planes operating on the stage between Gwadar and. Pibbah would be entirely dependent on Persian soil, which would be prohi bited territory for any emergency landing. He considered that there was a grave risk, which must be frankly faced, of serious incidents developing in the event of... emergency^., landings having to be made on Persian soil, while it was quite possible that the Persians might even impound any machine that might happen to land and detain 5 its passengers, GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSS stated that as the Persians could quite legally regard the three mile limit as within their territory, they would treat a flying coat in the same way, A forced landing on Persian soil or in Persian waters was a hypothetical contingency which would probably not occur, MR, KSNIEL feared that during the early stages of the development ox the new route it was almost inevitable tnat some forced landings on Persian soil shound occur, In the event of such Imridings trouble must be anticipated, particularly if land planes were used, as me Persians might reward the use on this route of land planer, wnicL in /the event of a forced lan-ding must come &amp;o«n on Jand, as b ine'/itably involving flights over their territory and infringing their rights. He cited the recent case of Er. Mo Hi son v*ho was detained by the Turks. He considered that Persian action :n a similar contingency would be even more drastic and certainly more difficult to deal witH. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE observed that the case of Er. Eollison could not be-taken as a parallel because in that instance it was his recollection that Mr. Mollison elected to fly across Turkey without taking the trouble to ask permission. This might naturally cause the Turks to be justly angry. Had Mr. Mollison been flying off their coast outside territorial limits and been forced to land on Turkish soil due to force majoure, the case might have been otherwise. MR. WALTON considered that the, disadvantage of using land planes ae opposed to the use of sea planes was in this respect very slight and coulu v^c-Ll bo taken. He suggested, that the Hannibal land -plane should be used at first to maintain the service. It would then be possible to revert to the use of sea planes if found necessary. MR. GRIEVE expressed the view that our action in establishing a route, for land planes, along the Arabian shore fulfilled the expressed requirements of the Persian Government.. That Government would not give us facilities for aerodromes or permission to fly over their territories. The present proposals obviated this as we should be doing exactly what was asked of us. We were not aepenaenr on Persian soil for the maintenance of this service, and any We were not dependent on forced landing, either either on Persian territory or in Persian waters would be in the nature of a shipwreck. MR. REKPEL stated that the risk of iandj-ng on Persian if it shouldMR* GRIKVB expressed the opinion that the catastrophic risk as opposed to the political risk could be accepted on both the Persian - Pi hah and Pibah - Gvvadar stages of the route. COLOISP SHEIMSRPIH2 did not agree that there vi/as any greater risk of a forced landing in the initial stages of a neu service of four-enginedHannihal machines * These machines are at present operating along the Persian route and could easily he transferred to the Arabian coast* POLITIC Alt ASPECT* Mi ~ D 1 BBAH sir. TOR. MRp RSRPEL stated that other factors arising from the use of land-planes on the stage between Basra and Pibbah had now to be considered * These were (a) the risk involved by a forced landing on the Trucial coast, (b) the possibility of French and Putch air 3.ines wishing to participate in the use of this route, and (o) the risk of forced landings and the establishment of landing grounds in the territory of Ibn Saud* lie considered that a forced landing off the Trucial coast by a sea-plane would lead to less difficulty than the forced landing of a land-plane. A flying boat could stay on the water and obtain relief either by a ship or by another flying boat. A land plane must necessarily land on shore, and owing to the uncertain attitude and unruliness of the Trucial tribes, the risk involved to passengers would be infinitely greater. Should passengers be murdered or kidnapped, it would probably be necessary to take rescue or punitive measures and sUO h contingent liabilities must be considered.' KRo GRISVB expressed the Tiev; that such a forced landing on the Trucial coast was of the same order as a catastrophic risk rather than a diplomatic one. C APT Alii CUhNIRGHIM, while agreeing with Mr. Ren del, wished to draw a distinction hotween an involuntary landing due to a minor defect and what might be termed a n catastrophic” landing* The French and Dutch air lines operate three-engined machines which fly longer stages than flown by machines of Imperial Airways* Their machines are less reliable and their margin of safety is lower. In his view, therefore, though there might be little chance of a forced landing by the four-engined Hannibal machine which Imperial Airways proposed to use, there was a very real danger of a Dutch or French machine being forced to come down « ]/p LO RED DSL expressed the view that, should we operate the section Basra to Gwadar by land planes, it would not o- possibly to prohibit the use of this route to foreign air lines s but he regarded the risk due both to catastrophe and native hostility as greater in the case of foreign aircraft * In the event of their making a forced landing on the Trucial coast, it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Govornment either to protect the foreign interests involved or to allow foreign nations to protect their own nationals = This v.ould involve other countries getting a footing in the Persian Gulf, an opportunity to which some might be by no means averse, and the possibility of the despatch of a foreign vessel to the Gulf and the establish ment of a permanent footing there by some other Power must be faced. i i—-~T7T“ ■^n,y foreign air line that wished to operate would, in f the case of ± 5 ahrein, have to apply to His Majesty T s Government for perrrission and would probably also ask for the use of landing grounds and other facilities, but might make no specific demands for protec cion« It would be very awkward to refuse such a request. Ah.o 1 AuTOh suggested tnat the question whether foreign aircraft should be allowed to operate the route need not be decided until it arose. He was not in a position to state the India Office view as the matter had not yet been considered But ii it iverc decided to endeavour to exclude foreign aircraft one possible line to take with foreign governments might be that as local rulers did not wish to allow landings on their territory, permission to foreign lines must be refused. CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM considered that this might open the door for foreign intervention which was just what we wanted to av o i d. MR* RMUDEL considered that such an excuse would carry no conviction and would be regarded by foreign countries merely as an excuse for putting them off. MR* WALTON then suggested that foreign aircraft should be allowed to operate only if they fulfilled the same conditions of safety as we might insist on, i.e» four-engined machines* COLONEL SHEUdERDINK stated that the Dutch air line has been operating the stage Athens - Alexandria, which is over SCO miles in length and is entirely over the sea, by three- engined land machines without mishap for over a year* They would therefore be prepared to operate with land planes any of the stages now contemplated in the Persian Gulf, and it would be difficult for us to object on technical grounds.GROUP CAPTitlN P.SIRSS thought that it was quite likely that the Dutch aircraft would make a direct flight down the Gulf from Basra to Bit ah (atout 650 miles) in which case this route would take them along the Persian Coast and away from the Trucial Coast. It was not improbable that the French or Dutch might produce a machine capable of making a non-stop flight from Basra to Qwadar, and he asked whether in these circumstance and auite apart from the route and type of aircraft vie had adopted whether such a proposal would be reiused. He thought that ; at any rate, it would be possible to stipulate that foreign aircraft should not fly over the Trucial coast. MR. IITHDEL, in reply to a question, expressed the opinion that, should the French and Dutch air lines obtain permission to continue the use of the route along the Persian shore, His Majesty's Government would be in a stronger position with the Persians, as equality of treatment for British inteiests might perhaps be classed under our most favoured nation anangements with Persia. CO LONS L SHFPihHBINS said that even if we established a sea plane service, the French and Butch air lines would still ask for facilities to operate a land plane service. In view of the proved reliability of Dutch machines, it would be very , j i oQ-ppnipllv if the Dutch, as was difficult to deny then this, especially n ■j „ -pi tr -f-rnn Bahrein to Gwadar xn one quite likely, proposed to fly iron flight. ' that it seemed unlikely that the GROUP CaPTAID Pml-fiS jp sai^rnau n n onhmit to the interruption of French and Dutch would easily . ±.^ gulf and that if they could fly long their air services in the brUx stages such as Basra - Diban or Bahrein - Gwadar it was hardly practical politics to try and exclude them from the Gulf. JK. K3ND3L then referred to the difficulties that mightarise in operating the stage Basra - Bahrein. This entails flying over the territory of Ibn Saud, King of the Hejaa - Nojd. Negotiations for obtaining Ibn Baud’s permission for the service and for the establishment of shore landing grounds on this sector had not been pursued and the legation at Jedda had been informed that as a sea plane service was proposed, these 7 nuld not be required by Imperial Airways. The moment for re-opening these negotiations was now unfavourable and we might have much difficulty. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE stated that the Royal Air Force had always asked for three emergency landing grounds on this sector, and negotiations had been -in continuous progress. As a icsult of Colonel Biscoe’s recent visit to Ibn Baud, three islands had teen suggested as likely places. MR. WALTON said that the authorities responsible for civil aviation in India viewed with apprehension the delay that would te involved by the institution of a flying boat service. rhis would dislocate the existing air time-tables and ground organisation in India. This was a further argument for the use of land planes. MR. RENDER drew attention to the vital importance of tae tine factor. Should our air service to India he interrupted, even temporarily, the Persians would consider that they had dealt a definite blow to British influence in the Gull ana scored an important diplomatic success. This would make it all the more difficult for H.M, Government to deal with the Persians in future. COLONEL SHSLMEBPIHB said that m order to continue the service without interruption, it would he necessary to transfer Calcutta flying heats which were now at Khartoum to the Persian Gulf. It was possible that B.A.P. Rangoon flying boats already 12in Irak could carry the mail service as a temporary measure. Should the 3.and plane service he approved of, it should he possible to establish this by the 1st June, provided the necessary landing ground and facilities at Dibbah were made available. MR. RENDER proposed that a draft memorandum should be prepared by the Foreign Office in conjunction with the Air Ministry, outlining both the advantages of the new proposal and clearly stating the risks involved. Before any decision regarding the use of land planes would be taken, it was necessary that the risks involved should be clearly stated and frankly faced. In order to avoid delay, he proposed that the memorandum should be prepared at once on the assumption that the establishment of a landing ground at Dibbah or Sharjah should be reported to be practicable. OORCLUSI ON: ~ The Sub-Committee agreed that - on the assumption that a landing ground at Dibbah or Sharjah was feasible - a report should be prepared by the Foreign Oifice in conjunction with the Air Ministry, outlining the proposals for the institution of a land plane service, between Basra and Karachi along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, together with the risks and implica tions involved, for the consideration of the Minisceiial rub-Committee, and recommending that, provided these risks arc fully realised and .accepted, the aacption of these praposls should be sanctioned 2. m t eha 11 Gardens, S»R. 1» , Sbh April, 1932.No.: roRIA 12* 6 - /y.

Dear Walton, With reference to your letter of the 8th instant PZ. 2173/32, I now forward for your information a copy of a revised draft memorandum, agreed by the Air Ministry and the Treasury, which I have to-day given to Rendel at the Foreign Office for his consideration. You will see that this revised draft starts with a brief historical record.carrying the story from the last meeting of the Ministerial Sub Committee, embodies nearly all of Rendel's critical objections and includes the India Office paragraphs, a copy of which you sent to me. It now looks from recent telegrams received that Sharja is going to be a much more suitable place than Dibbah. In any case, of course, nothing must go to the Ministerial Committee until we have received from Biscoe his report on the security of the aerodrome selected as a night stopping place. I am glad to see from your telegram of the 8th instant that he will take the opportunity of proceeding from Bushire to Sharja to-day.

The recommendation of the Ministerial 3 uWjcamlttes at Me) above WA » based on proposals for operating ^he .ersian oui. ••ction of the ngland-Xndla air service with a nipht stop at ' ft8 *al“ f ‘n«imah.Ob the 20th December, X93X, the PoXiticaX Heeideut ia the Persian OuXf reported the fa.Xure of negotiation i with the [•heilch of Bas-al-'haimah for the desired faciXities ^uod said that he thought that it was useXesa to maire further efforts there ae the heikh, eXthough himaelf shawing some disposition to come to terms, was powerXess in face of XocaX opposition. Negotiations were then be/mn with the Phaifch of ebai with a Yiaw to usin^ D^bai instead of as-al-Khaimah as the night stopping pXace on the Arabian ooast. The )oXitloaX Beaident reported, however, that the hai^ch of T'ebai was aXso unwiXling to accept responsibility of affording the desired facilities to Imperial Airways, Ltd. 4« It, therefore, became necessary t© consider further ftlttmative proposals. Of these the most promising was to use ' aloutta* flying boats on the route Bahrun-Yas Island (night stop) -Kes-al-^haimah (for refuelling - Gwadar (night stop). The prorision of a boat or yaoht tor use as a depot &lt; hip an^ the aocomfiod tion of passengers orernight at Y^s 1*1^* and the construction of a r?st house at Gwadar were involved a 3 well as refuelling at T as-al-Khaimah. The Political Besident did not anticipate that there would be ^ny opposition to the use of ^as-aIhaimah for refuelling in daylight but th© possible necessity of usin * in emergency Baa-al- haimah as a night stop ceuld not entirely be excluded. 5. ith reference to the estimate accepted by the Ministerial Gub-Coiauittee (see paragraph 1(a) above a revised approximate e timate was submitted b ( Imperial Airways givin : the additional annual cost to the Company and the initial capital expenditure as follows : - It WISED APfhQXl&amp;ATA A. 1' I MATE Oe AD)&gt;I‘TIO»aL AMNUA L 003T Ct* OF iRnTIHG FROM BAHH/IN TO KARACHI ' ITH CA!

Owing to the failure of the negotiations which the Politics! Resident was attempting to carry through a meeting was held at the Ur Ministry on 15th February, 1932, to consider further the proposals. At this meeting the Foreign Office representative reported that a telegram had bean received from Mr. Hoere (Tehran) in which he gave it as his opinion that so loxig es the Minister of Court believed in the likelihood of a settlement of the general Treaty negotiations Imperial Airways ltd. would probably be all wed to continue to function on the present route. 7, e need therefore for making arrangements for the operation of the service by the Arabian coast route as from 1st April 1932 di&lt;« not appear to be urgent. ubsequently *•?•**&amp; permission for the operation of the Persian route by Iia^erial Ainr ys was extended from 3iat arch, 1932 to 3lot ay The telegram dated 29th February from Mr. Hoare (Tehran w«si- '’Permission for Imperial Airways extended until th, end of May, Minister has promised to consider t rms of ns* agreement in anticipation of general Battlement”.

(B) Kalba; technically fair; little labour is available but only slight preparation necessary no seaplane anchorage security is doubtful and place is very isolated. (C) Sharja; good technically; very little labour is required to prepare although plenty is available; comparatively civilised, security good there is seaplane anchorage at Dibai 12 miles away if insisted on. Dibai is to all intents and purposes the capital of Trucial coast. 8. I recommend Sharja. Welsh 1 s comments as to security and political situation are of course subject to confirmation by Resident Persian Gulf who will visit Sharja as soon as practicable. 9.

The Shaikh has been harried by his neighbour and will do anything to get our protection. ]?or flying boats it is entii-ely useless but for land machines I should think quite suitable. If you could possibly let me have a decision by, say, the 8th or 9th April I could 2iea.ve here on the 11th, pick up the M Shoreham' ! from Bahrain on the 12th or 13th and £0 e&gt; straight down either to Shaxgah or Dibbah, whichever place is considered preferable. If I cannot do this, tnen I shall be badly hung up for transport. For practical reasons I am against a rest house in a boat. Sibbah bay is very exposed! there would frequently be much difficulty in getting out to the boat and the unhappy passengers, I imagine, would very often spend a pretty uncomfortable night rocking at anchor. If tlle Shaikh welcomes aircraft, which i think he will, and we give him enough money to provide guards and buy some rifles and at the same time address a pretty stern warning to his neighbour on the other side of the bay j d0 not think there will be much danger.

While I don’t want to be too optimistic, for the reasons stated in my despatch on the subject, which will reach you by this mail, I rather doubt the Bani Bu Ali giving trouble again: if, as I hope will be the case, ships continue to visit Sur and aircrait Khor Jarama, we shall definitely maintain control. There is no doubt that the Boyal Air Force had a tremendous moral effect, and I think the whole business will have wide repercussions as shornng (a) our determination to support the authority of the State, and ^b) our ability to hit in the interior. Could you let me know if there is any truth in the statement by Reuters tlaat we are lending Bin Baud a oOO.Ouu ? If so I do not see why His Majesty's Government should not do something to implement their promise to the Shaikh of Kuwait. Even if they cannot make any definite demand to Bin Saud to raise the blockage ( and I agree this would be difficult ) they might get him to agree to discuss the matter in a friendly spirit with a view to arriving at a settlement or some diplo matic formula of that sort. It would at any rate show Bin Saud that His Majesty's Government attach importance to the matter, and facilitate subsequent discussions. I am not at all happy about Bahrain. The State is confronted with a deficit of over a lakh and the only economies suggested up to date amount to only Rs.43,000 in a full year and much less during the coming year, aM even this the Govern- „ _ _ are trying to whittle down.

As I said to Hoare the other day our policy in the Gulf seems to De to grovel on the one side and. to bully on the other, I do hope that you people will take up the question with India, and point out that these tariff restriction clauses are really quite out of keeping with the spirit of the present age.

Shelmerdme' s letter of 24th March, flag B. The S. of S.'s telegram to Col. Biscoe and the G. of I. of 24th March, flag C, gives a short summary of the new scheme. Col. Biscoe's views are set out in his telegram of 26th March, flag D, and the G. of I. have stated, in a telegram of 1st April, that they agree with his views. .. Mr. Woods Humphry ^ was present at the meeting on 5th April, and explained the advantages of the scheme in further detail. The Air Ministry and the Treasury strong favoured the new proposals, and the meeting generally agreed. The F.O., however, drew attention to certain objections which they feel and which are enumerated under| Heads A, B, C, D and E of the attached draft memo. The adoption of the proposals depends, of course, on Dibah or Sharjah being found suitable for a landing ground. It will be noted that Col. Biscoe does not anticipate any great difficulty from the political point of view, provided that a sufficient subsidy to ensure/ mensure protection is granted to the Sheikh concerned (as tp which the Treasury are prepared to agree). Reports on the practicability of both places are expected in the course o the next few days. If either report is favourable, it is proposed to submit the scheme to the Ministerial Sub- Committee in a memo, on the lines of the F.O. draft below. This F.O. draft has been prepared subject to additions to be incorporated by the Air Ministry and 1.0. Some draf|t paras, which, it is suggested should be incorporated on behalf of the I.O., and which are self-explanatory, are submitted. If Dibah (or Sharjah) is reported to be practicable from the flying point of view, it is proposed to' send a telegram to Col. Biscoe at once authorising him to open negotiations with the Sheikh concerned, with a view to an agreement with him whereby he would receive alsubsidy and grant the requisite facilities, and undertake effective responsibility for safety and protection so far as possible; Col. Biscoe would be informed that he should * await further instructions (to be sent after the decision of the Ministerial Sub-Committee) before committing ■n Hdf.G. 1^/ !■ Lf.

A ^ /n. ilie India Office consider that, while the risks enumerated above.must be recognised, they are ali fair risks whi c h'may • - 1-egit'imat e 1 be taken, in view of the superior advantages of using the Hannibal type of land aircraft over the Calcutta flying boats from the financial, commercial and technical points of view. As regards Section B above, they feel that the risk of hostile action by tribesmen in the event of an emergency landing on the Trucial Coast is perhaps over estimated by the Foreign Office. The area m question is almost entirely desert, with a few scattered hamlets belonging to the Trucial Sheikhdoms along the coast. The risk that the subjects of these Sheikhs would take hostile advantage of an emergency landing is very much less than would be the risk of a prepared attack on a regular night stopping place established on the Trucial Coast without a guarantee of protection by the ruling Sheikh, if it were pro nosed to establish a night stop under such conditions (which is, of course, not the case). Nor does the 7 / ) 4000 8/31risk of hostile action by wandering Bedouin in the case of an emergency landing seem to be very extensive in this sparsely inhabited area. As regards Section C above, the nossibility of political difficulties arising if foreign aircraft are allowed to operate the Arabian route is recognised. The question whether such operation should be allowed is one which will have to be considered in due course. When the time comes for a decision, it might, from the local political point of view, be preferable if possible for H.M.G. to endeavour to exclude foreign aircraft, relying on the exclusive nature of our treaty relations with the Trucial Sheikhs; if, however, this should not prove possible, it would j seem desirable to explain the position frankly to the foreign governments concerned, with a view to their taking all the precautions against the risk 01 emergency landings by their own aircraft which we propose to take in the case of British aircraft, if, none the less, an emergency landing by a foreign aircraft should lead to trouble with the native inhabitants, we should no doubt have oo take measures to protect or rescueDraft Paper. ih ^ Lm. b ^ 0 L ^ 214a 4000 8/3\ Department. the crew and passengers, rather than acquiesce in the foreign government concerned taking such measures (an alternative which can hardly be contemplated) . But this contingent risk, though its existence may be recognised, does not appear to be one which need seriously weigh at present against the adoption of the proposal to operate the British air route by land aircraft.A difficulty Ms arisen in connexion with the impending transfer of the Eastern Air Route fra© the Persian to the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. A decision by Minister* is required on the following points* Following on the final conclusion of the Ministerial Middle Fast Committee of Roc ember l?th, lb31, arrange- raenta were put in hand for the institution of a Flying host service along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, to replace the service of land planes now flying over outh Persia when imperial Airways' present penult from the Persian oovomment expires. The Foreign Office having strongly represented the difficulties in the way of obtaining any extension of this permit, and it having become clear that the Persian Government were only prepared to afford us satisfaction at the price of quite unacceptable political concessions, it was agreed that all arrangement' for the transfer of the service to the Arabian coast must be ready on the expiry of the provisional two months' extension recently granted by the Persian Govemmant, i.e. on *y 31st, 19Sa. These arrangements were about to be put into effect, although certain important points still remained outstanding, when, towards the end of March, Imperial Airways put forward an entirely new proposal for the operation of the service along the Arabian coast by 1 -md *»• •• land plan#!? inotwid of ««&amp; 4«a««. The pro^omi the pre?*eut four^onglBed Humibal type of laud plane should be used. Instead at the three*engined Gal Ci; tflying boats which It sirs props Bed to b rifs^ fr®a Africa for the purpose. The advantages of the four-engine's loud plane service would be as follows; UJ Time factor.

The practicability of this service depends on a night stopping station being established. ' 'I' gxpac!

Although it is proposed tv should fly outside Persian territorial waters, it is clear that any emergency landing would have to f&gt;® • ffacted an Persian soil. As the Persians win have definitely refused to pemit Imperial Airways to con* ttnue to use and to fly over Persian territory any landing ®ade on Persian soil would probably lead to grave complications. ere the service to be operated hy ilying boats, a minor defect could perhaps be rectified by a descent la the open sea, and even if it were necessary to alight in , orsiaa waters, it would at least fee obvious that a serious attempt had been mads to avoid using Persian territory. On the other hand a land plane service presupposes the eventuality of utilising for emergency landings the territory of the states over which it is operated, and the Ooverumat.Government would probably consider, sore if emergency landltiga ted to be made in Persia, ttet Imperial Airway*? were merely attempting to evade by a subterfuge their refusal to continue to grant the desired pemleelon. In those circumstances emergency landings might even lead to the confieca- tior. of the aircraft and possibly the arrest of the pilots aad/or paasengers, and a diplomatic situation of considerable difficulty would probably arise. In the case of land planes, any emergency landing on the Tracial Coast would probably have to be made among wild and hostile tribes, whereas in the case of flying boats emergency landings could be made either within reach of shipping or, at any rate, sufficiently far Iran the shore not to toe exposed to the hostility of the natives. Sere an emergency landing to toe made among a hostil tribe mA a disaster to result, the despatch of » rescue or punitive expedition might be necessitated and involve expenditure on a far larger scale than anything contemplated in connexion with the actual institution and operation of the service. (a)When the question of the Arabian Air Houte waa considered in the summer of 1931, it was agreed that if the proposed service were operated by flying boats, the danger of the French and Dutch attempting to operate it would be small, since neither the French nor the Dutch at present use or are lively to construct flying boats of the required type, and it would be possible to reply to any applications which they might make to Hie Majesty's Government for per mission to use the service by explaining that Hie Majesty’s Government had not even slioweu i.-ieir wr companies to use land planes owing to the risKs in volved. If, on the other hand, a British land plan service is instituted, it will be practically impos sible to prevent the French and Dutch services (which at present use three-engined machines but have a very wide radius), to use the landing ground at Dibbah anc robnbly also that at Bahrein, ihis would mean:- (a) That foreigners would obtain a footing on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, (which it has hitherto been the policy of ' the ' ,ov erment of India strongly to oppose). That the risks of trouble with the native inhabitants contemplated in section (B)abovt would be very greatly increased. v iw oi + hpr {i) be conwitted to That we shoulu either , . _ t ne french and Dutch and the protection of the trvin* possibly other foreign companies in «mere:encies (b) (c)m ®n*rpe':Ci®p, aud should therefor® find of our to undcrtAK* an r*»cu« or punitive expedition •»» grently increas- ; or (a )if »« tior, wc should to accept this oeiiim- foreigi, Governeiente concernaa In th« tsulng tiieir owi; mea«ure*e for protection of their which might lead to the appearance of foreign war or other forces on the Arab coast oi’ the Feraian Gulf, it should be remvsberoa that the fracial const is not a writish colony and t:&gt;&gt;.t our policy hitherto not to fairs. merely to lity for Its internal out all other I m ^(D) Held . jUast auturrm we abandoned any further attempt to obtain from Ibn Baud facilities for the operation of a British land plane service over his territory, as we were Informed that Imperial Airways had decided against the use of land planes in favour of the use of flying boats to be operated outside territorial waters. Hie consent has not yet been obtained to our most recent request that he should establish regular emergency landing grounds on the coast of Mejdj and in making the request it was stated that for the present at least Service aircraft only were involved. Imperial Airways, if they are obliged to utilise Nejd territory from time to time for emergency landings, would certainly encounter difficulties from Ibn Baud's official* and tribesmen, unless some arrangement had previously been made with him on the subject. (i£) ^ Catoatmahe...xLgj£'. The Foreign Office are not qualified to express any opinion on this point, but it should be borne In mind that a forced landing by a land plane over the sea out of reach of land is likely to prove more disastrous than that of a flying boat. Ihe question of the advantages of » land plane service and of the risks attending it outlined above has been considered by the Middle East (official) Sub- Gommlttee to the Committee of Ironsrial Defence, majority of the Committee are, on the whole, in favour of the adoption of land planes, notwithstanding the risks involved. The Foreign Office, however, feel that these risks,rissce, and especially the risk of grave complications with the Persian Government (Section A above), should to# clearly realised and definitely accepted by Ministers with all their implications before they can agree to the course proposed. It is essential that a decision should be reached at the earliest possible moment as unless the necessary arrangements are made without further delay, the air service to India will have to be interrupted on May 31st, which will have a deplorable effect on British prestige in the Middle East, and encourage the Persian Government to believe that they have dealt a severe blow to British influence in the Persian Gulf.-4 w BY AIR MAIL. 3 / All communications should be addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Industries and Labour, (Civil Aviation) by title, NOT by name.

Sir, $0 I am directed to refer to the correspondence now in progress between His Majesty f s Government and the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department on the above subject. From the correspondence referred to, it appears to be contemplated that, in the event of the operation of the service by flying boats along the Arabian Coast, night stops on the eastbound service will oe made at Bahrein and Gwadur. There is no indication of the night stopping places for the westbound service, but it is assumed that aga.in Gwadur would be one, and in consequence that Imperial Airways would arrive at Karachi late in tne morning and depart westbound in the afternoon. 2* The calculations of the Government of India for internal services are based on the arrival of Imperial Airways at Karachi in the evening and departure in the morning. Should the change of time taole maKe it impossible , ^or the internal services to leave Karachi until midday, Mar 1932o c 932 it may happen that much of the time saving advantages which they are expected to provide will disappear, and a similar result will probably follow from a later departure from Karachi in the westbound direction. 3 . In view of the uncertainty which still exists with regard to the future Arabian Coast route, the G-overnment \ of India do not propose to suspend action in connection with the establishment of internal air mail services.They will, however, be glad if the fact that they still attach great importance to the arrival of Imperial Airways at Karachi in the evening and departure in the morning may be brought to the notice of His Majesty f s G-overnment in connection with the organisation of the Arabian Coast route, and if they may be kept fully informed of any contemplated changes with regard to the time table of Imperial Airways. 4 . I am also to request that early information may be provided, in the event of the new route having to be adopted, with regard to Imnerial Airways plans, if they propose to land flying boats in Karachi harbour, in order that adequate arrangements for custom’s examination and the handling of mails may be made.

In either case it must he assumed that a strict limitation must oe imposed on the R 0 P,Mo and power output at which the remaining engines can he cruised, as otherwise the risk of a second failure would he serious. Having regard to the experience gained with the Jupiter XI F* engine it may reasonably te assumed that the remaining engines will continue to run for a sufficient period to enable the aircraft to reach safety provided the B.P.M. are not allowed to exceed 1900 = in order to obtain a fair comparison betweenthe merits ol the two aircrafts it is necessary to fix the total weights at which they can be operated so as to comply with the . - r~-e , : ,v i -i tv to continue flying with one essential condition of ability oo engine oufr of action.

The Oman Peninsula is approximately the half way point between Basra and Karachi# An aerodrome and night resthouse, say, near Libah would permit the present schedule to be operated and Y/ould avoid the increase of a day owing to it being impossible to stay the night at Ras-el-Khaimah, The route visualised is;- Basra - Bahrein 345 Bahrein Yas Island 185 Yas Island - Dibah 260 Dibah GY&gt;radar 380 Gwadar - Karachi 300 or alternatively 2 - Basra ~ Bahrein 345 Bahrein - Dibah 360 Dibah - Gv/adai* 380 Gwadar Karachi 300 The advantages &lt;*f using land aircraft are $- Fi nancial 0 Without committing ourselves yo figures at this stage, there can be no^ doubt that a substantial saving can be made in re gar a to the additional capital and recurring expenditure involved. 2.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W. 1. 29tlji March, 1932. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 16th March, E* 1111/208/54, on the subject of the Persian treaty negotiations. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Grovemment of India, who should receive it before the end of the month, and Sir Samuel Hoare, before comitting himself to a final expression of opinion on the comprehensive issues now raised, would wish to ascertain their general views. But he desires in the meantime to offer to Sir John Simon the following provisional observations on the various points mentioned in your letter which he has examined seriatim. 2. He concurs in the view expressed in para. 2 and has no comment to make on the lucid and convenient sumuary of dgjy 5 derata detailed in paras. 3 and 4, except that it seems right to add the general advantages to be gained by Persia by consolidating her friendship with this country, end the enhancement of her international prestige from the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty with His Majesty’s Government cn a basis of reciprocity and equality. It may perhaps be legitimately assumed that the Persian Government (whatever their ostensible attitude) are no^ blind to these potential advantages and, if so, this fact, far more than any individual concession, should provide them with an inducement to meet the very moderate requirements of His Majesty s Government. 3. As regards para. 5 of your letter, Bir Samuel Hoare, while agreeing that sane of the particular concessions offered to Persia are of more importance than others, considers that taken together they cannot be regarded ss without substantial value. The War and post-War debt is admittedly unlikely to be paid by Persia, but it is in the eyes of His Kojesty’s Government a legitimate claim, based on the agreement of h.-L, ‘ /2. Minister of Court maintains that the value of a claim depends chiefly cn the value attached to it by the claimant, it is no less open to His Majesty’s Government to adopt the same attitude in regard to some of their am proposed concessions. The British claim to Basidu is juridically weak, but its weakness can hardly be compared with that of the Persian claims to Tamb, Abu Musa snd Bahrein, in view especially ox tne i acts that Basiuti has been occupied for over a century by the British and that the Persian claims are to Islands never, at least since a remote period, in their effective occupation. 4* n he Buzdap railway still appears to Sir Samuel Hoare bo bo one of the most important braining assets in His Majesty's Governw‘,ab' s possession. It hns always been clear tnat it is in any case impossible for H.M. Government end the Government of India without Persia’s consent to XfiJi&amp;ia possession, but Persia would gain little from her acquisition of that section unless it was coupled with an agreement by the Government of India to provide rolling stock, etc., and (most important) to operate the Indian section of the line. This the Government of India can only do at great financial loss to themselves, and it is the orospsct of this concession widen gives possibilities of leverage m the negotiations. 5.

Sir S-uei Hoare 1. i«r«aeb by the vice ' - * *your letter, and subject to the observations of the Air Ministry, would be disposed to agree with Sir John Simon that the attitude suggested in para. 8 of your letter should be adopted on this point. 7. Aa regards Henjam, the Secretary of State would wish to await the views of the Lords Conmiasioners of the Admiralty, who are primarily concerned. But as at present advised, while he would be disposed to con air in the adoption of the proposal that instead of a lease a definite undertaking should be given by the lerBian GrOYemraent that the present facilities at Hen jam should b ; continued for a term of years, of which the number should be specified, he fears that it might be of little use to obtain an agreement with the Minister of Court, unless in a definite form which would be incorporated in the treaty. B. In regard to the conclusion reached in para. 12 of your letter, namely that if (the air route concession being separated from the general negotiations) it is not possible to secure satisfaction from Taimourtaehe on the subject of Hen jam, all the offers which have previously been made contingently to Persia, with the addition presumably of the remaining .£510,000 of war debt and possibly other concessions, should be made good in return merely for the withdrawal of the unsubstantial Persian claims to Bahrein, Tsmb, md Abu Musa, it may be doubted whether in such circumstances it is worth while to coaolU' ::: treaty at all. In this connection I am desired to refer to Sir R. Clive’ despatch No. 343 of June 26th, 1931. in which the conclusion was reached that His Majesty's Government are unlikely to be seriously inconvenienced if no general treaty is concluded fw the present. If therefore Tairaourtache does not recede Irora his present position regarding Henjam and if he is not prepared to conclude a treaty on the general basis already put forward by His Majesty's Government, Sir Samuel Hoare (though he recognises the desirability of improving our relations with Persia if possible) would suggest (subject to the views of theGovernment of India and the other Imperial Departments concerned) that it is a matter for consideration whether it would not he preferable that the negotiations should be suspended by mutual agreement. 9* dir Samel Hoare, however, is not without none that clear* if it is made/definiteiy and courteously to the Persian Government that the Unit of concession has been reached by His Majesty’s Government and if a firm policy is adopted in the matter of Hen jam and the air route, this policy is as likely as any other to mature in a satisfactory conclusion to the n eg oti ati on 3 . 10.

Docum ent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] WITH reference to Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 92 of the 17th February (a copy of which was sent to you on the 4th March), regarding the general treaty negotiations with Persia, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state that in his opinion it is now necessary to consider the position of these negotiations as a whole in view of the Persian Government’s latest suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should agree to withdraw the British naval depot from Hen jam, and to obtain instead a prolongation of Imperial Airways’ permit to operate the South Persian air route. 2. Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will remember that in September 1930 a comprehensive memorandum, showing the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the general treaty negotiations, was communicated to the Persian Government. This document, a copy of wdiich was enclosed in Sir Be Clive’s despatch No. 467 of the 23rd September, 1930, explained that there was only one tangible advantage which His Majesty’s Government would themselves derive from the proposed treaty, and that this advantage was the continuance by agree ment with the Persian Government, for a further period, of the refuelling and recreational facilities enjoyed by British warships at Hen jam. The fact, there fore, that the Persian Government are no longer willing to grant a lease of the naval depot at Hen jam has changed profoundly the whole aspect of the general treatv negotiations. 3. The main advantages, tangible or otherwise, to be gained by His Majesty’s Government under the proposed treaty, as hitherto contemplated, may be summarised as follows :— (a) Hen jam. Continuance for at least twenty, and possibly fifty, years of the recreational and refuelling facilities now enjoyed by His Majesty’s ships. (b) Bahrein. Abandonment of Persian claim. (c) Tamb and Abu Musa. Abandonment of Persian claims. (d) A non-aggression article to include the Arab sheikhdoms undei British protection on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. (7 PoS S alsolhe repayment by Persia of the capital of the £490,000 pre-war debt. Persia is, however, at present paying interest on this sum, and is understood to be likely to repay the capital shortly, apart from the general treaty. 4. On the other hand, the main advantages to be gained by the Persian Government are the following PERSIA. March 16, 1932. CONFIDENTIAL. E 1111/208/34] Section 1. Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, March 16, 1932. £1 million of this sum in return for a satisfactory settlement. [416 q—1](6) Cession to Persia of wireless station at Hen jam and wireless apparatus at Bushire and Lingah. (7) Removal of British Residency from Bushire. 5. The concessions oft'ered to the Persian Government, as enumerated in the preceding paragraph, are in point of fact of less importance than at first sight appears. The Persian Government, for example, have no intention of repaying the war and post-war debt, which they consider was spent in British rather than Persian interests at a time when British troops were in occupation of the country, and which ought, so the Persian Minister of Court maintains, to be regarded as British war expenditure. The British claim to Basidu is legally so weak that it could not be maintained if seriously challenged by Persia. Again, it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India to do other than hand over to Persia the Persian section of the Duzdab Railway, built during the war on Persian territory without Persia’s consent. It is clear that the Persian Minister of Court would prefer a more spectacular success than that which he would obtain through a settlement by which Persia obtained merely the concessions set forth above. It is for this reason that he has raised the question of the withdrawal of the British naval depot from Hen jam. 6. Hen jam, however, is not the only point on which Teymourtache is raising difficulties. He refuses to abandon the Persian claim to Bahrein. There is no indication that he is prepared to abandon the similar claims to Tamb and Abu Musa, or that he will be prepared to agree to a satisfactory claims article. The one and only advantage which he now holds out as an inducement to His Majesty’s Government to conclude a treaty is the possibility of an extension of the permission for Imperial Airways to operate the South Persian air route. 7. As regards the air route, His Majesty’s Government have carefully endeavoured hitherto to avoid giving Teymourtache the impression that they are entirely dependent upon Persia for the continuance of the British civil air route to India. In Sir John Simon’s opinion it is important to continue to take this line. If Teymourtache is given reason to believe that the Persian air route is a question of vital importance to His Majesty’s Government, there can be no doubt that he will refuse to give them satisfaction as regards Bahrein, Tamb, or Abu Musa, or, indeed, as regards any of the other points in the general treaty. Moreover even if His Majesty’s Government were to agree to accept the air route as the only tangible advantage to be derived by them from the treaty, they can ia\e no guarantee that the Persian Government would thereafter carry out the spirit, as well as the letter, of their obligation; there can be no effective guarantee to prevent them from cancelling Imperial Airways’ concession at any time on the pretext that the company have failed to abide by the conditions of their contract, finally the Secretary of State feels strongly that the acceptance of the Persian proposal would form an undesirable precedent; that it would become known, not only m Persia, but also m other countries, that political concessions could be extracted from His Majesty’s Government as the price of a permit to operate air services over foreign territory; and that exactly similar difficulties would arise with the Persian Government when Imperial Airways’ new contract eventually expired. 8 Sir John Simon therefore feels that, as regards the air route, Mr Hoare should receive instructions to take the line that this question is not one of those Co™'lP° haV fl u 11 hf 1 ' Wlth , ln the g e,leral treaty; that if the Persian orart7criJe ,v,nu.

Government. If, then, the Persian Govern- wftK fi for withdrawal, there is no possible ground for a refusal to comply then wishes, and all that can be done is to endeavour to obtain sufficient notice to make alternative arrangements elsewhere. To break off treaty negotia- 10 ns owing to the Persian attitude regarding Hen jam would not improve the position for, m the event of a nature of negotiations, it would still be necessary f a J est ys Government to comply with the Persian Government’s desire that the depot should be removed elsewhere. i i 1 ?!, T 11 be ! S 1 een tbat Mr ‘ Hoare suggests that the question of Henjam should be dealt with by notes, to be exchanged simultaneously with the signature of the treaty, under which His Majesty’s Government would agree to withdraw from Henjam, and the Persian Government, on their side, would grant sufficient time for alternative arrangements to be made elsewhere. Mr. Hoare has explained semi-officially that he might try to arrange for this final note from the eisian Government to contain an assurance that the units of the Gulf Squadron would still be welcomed at Henjam for recreational purposes in the course of their cruises, and he would also endeavour to secure an interpretation of the term recreational purposes, in a semi-official letter from Teymourtache, as meaning that the canteen, club and football ground could be retained. 11. While there can be little doubt that, if the Persian Government insist on a withdrawal, it will be necessary to accept a settlement on the lines proposed by Mr. Hoare, if this can be arranged, it might be possible at the outset to npproanh Teymourtache on somewhat different lines in the hope of reaching a more satisfactory solution. Mr. Hoare might say that negotiations have been proceeding for years on the assumption that Teymourtache was prepared to agree to a lease of Henjam; His Majesty’s Government now wish to hold his Highness to his previous agreement to come to a mutually satisfactory arrangement on this question. If, however, his Highness does not wish to enter into a formal lease, such as that hitherto under discussion, His Majesty’s Government will be satisfied if he will agree that His Majesty’s ships shall for a certain period of years enjoy the facilities for recreation and refuelling at Henjam which they have enjoyed in the past; and it would be well if Mr. Hoare were in a position to add that the forthcoming arrival of the new Persian navy seemed to render it possible for His Majesty’s Government to repay the Persian Government for facilities granted to His Majesty’s ships at Henjam by providing facilities, though of a somewhat different kind, for the new Persian navy. For example, Mr. Hoare might point out that the Persian Government will inevitably find that their new warships, if they are to be maintained in a seaworthy condition, will require the normal docking facilities at certain stated periods, and that, until the Persian Government have provided such docking facilities for themselves, it might be convenient for them to be allowed to use such facilities as are available in Indian dockyards. Although the Secretary of State is not confident that this line of approach would offer a satisfactory solution, he considers it desirable at least to explore the possibility of offering the Persian Government advantages for their navy, such as docking facilities, and I am to enclose a copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Admiralty on this point. 12. Finally, as regards the General Treaty negotiations as a whole, it seems necessary to decide which are the essential points upon which Mr. Hoare should stand firm. If, as explained above, it is not proposed to accept as a basis of negotiation the offer of the South Persian air route as the sole advantage to be gained by His Majesty’s Government from the treaty, and if it is impossible to obtain as a result of the treaty the facilities required at Henjam, it seems necessary to concentrate on the other British desiderata enumerated in paragraph 3 above. More especially, it seems desirable that the Persian claims to Bahrein, Tamb and Abu Musa should be finally disposed of as a result of the general settlement. The Persian claim to Bahrein, in particular, however ill-founded it may be, is inconvenient on account of the considerable expenditure4 involved in the construction there of a new naval depot as an alternative to* Heni am, and of a new Residency as an alternative to Bushire.^ It is highly desirable that, before incurring such expendituie, His Majesty s Government should be assured of absolute security of tenure, such as can be achieved only by the final abandonment of the Persian claim. It is therefore to be hoped that Mr. Hoare will be able to persuade the Persian Government to agiee at least to ^ abandon these claims as a result of the general settlement, and in return for th / war debt, the Duzdab Railway, Basidu, Sirri, the transfer of the Residency, and such other concessions as it is proposed to make to Persia. 13. The Secretary of State will be glad to learn if Sir Samuel Hoare agrees generally in the views expressed above. 14.

In this connection I send you herewith a copy of the notes of a meeting held here on the 21st instant, and a copy of a letter from Imperial Airways Ltd. dated 23rd idem. These two documents will, I think, make the position quite clear to you. I also send you a copy of Colonel Burchall’s letter to me dated 10th March which deals with Commander Galpin’s investigation of the possibility of an aerodrome at Dibah. Imperial Airways have, I think, made out a good case and it is supported by the Air Staff here. There is, however, one point which they have not brought out and that is that the use ol land machines as proposed will give complete elasticity; that is to say that if, ^-S we suppose, the best terms which we can extract from Persia prove to be a series of short term agreements we shall be in a position to move over to the Arabian Coast at short notice at any time and also to move back to the Persian Coast should Persia prove more amenable. To effect this all that is essential is a rest house or rest vessel and wireless facilities at Dibah. These revised proposals will now have to be considered by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East of which I hope to be able to arrange a meeting early tne week af er next. Before the meeting Is held we think tnat it J.G. Walton, Esq., G.B., M.C., India Office, S .W .1 •would be a very good thing to ascertain Biscoe f s opinion on the new proposals from the point of view of having a rest house or a rest vessel at Dibah. The R.A.F. will make the necessary arrangements for inspection of the proposed aerodrome site with a view to ascertaining its suitability. Gould you get a telegram off to Bisco&lt; to-day outlining as much of the proposals and of their advantages as you think fit. The proposal now put forward would have the added advantage of enabling us to maintain our present time-table whereby we operate between Basra and Karachi in 2 days, instead of losing a day on this section which we should do if boats were used. Yours sincerely P.SCOPY IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LTD., Airway Terminus, Victoria Station, S.W.l. HB/PS/259 10th March, 1932, Dear Shelmerdine, You will doubt less like to know that we have received a cable from Commander Galpin, who was investigating the pee sibilities of making an aerodrome at Dibah on the east coast of the Musundam Peninsula, that an excellent aerodrome can be made there. He adds that little levelling will be required and that the surface is good after rains : the Southern Sheikh will make an aerodrome at Dibah without cost, if he is guaranteed British protection from the Northern Sheikh; he will welcome Imperial Airways heartily and a rest house can be built. Galpin adds finally that the Northern Sheikh is very unsatisfactory. I am afraid I cannot offer you any information as to the sphere of influence of the Northern and Southern Sheikhs respectively, but possibly you will have this information in the Air Ministry.

B-.C.A. said that the proposal to operate the service by land planes as far %n Bahrein and thence by flying boats (with night stops at Y&amp;s Island and Dwadar) in the event of it becoming necessary to abandon the Persian route had bean agr-ed to interdepartmentally and by Imperial Airways Ltd. The company had since put forward various suggestions end it wra now imperative to j&amp;tain absolute finality in regard to plans for diverting the service to the Arabian coast. Mr. 'ood?? Humphery said that the company would prefer to operate the service throughout with landplanes. D.C.A. enquired whether this view was based on the report of 'omnander I alp in* Mr. 5 oods Humphery replied that it was not; but that the Company had always favoured the use of land planes. He wa® convinced that the service could be operated more efficiently with the 4-engined Xandpl&amp;rej* available than with 3-engined Calcutta flying boats. % r.0.A. pointed out that a proposal to operate with ^anIplsnee had already been negatived and said that it seamed to him rather late in the day to bring still another fresh proposal before the Committee. He could not help feeling that the Company on occasion had submitted proposals to the ..ir Ministry without having given them the full consideration the department had the right to expect• q.C.•. asked D.C.0.1. to indicate the basis of the Air Staff*a objection to the operation of the service by Irndrlanea. '- J' .1. said that objection had been raised not only by the Air Ministry but also by the oreign Office, the admiralty and the Political resident in the ersian Gulf; in fact at one time there had been complete opposition by some departments to the use of the Arabian route at all* Objections were based on the general quest ion of what would be the consequence of the' landing of an aircraft at a. place other than its intended landing place. The attar resolved itself into one of lack of security and there was a political as well us a practical aid© to it. Tharawas also the possibility that the 'ranch and the Dutch would then desire similar facilities; this'would ’till further increase the difficulties. /Mr.Mr* ' ooda iiu^phery admitt *4 that Opar tion with lanrlplanes was continuant upon the .finding of a suitable spot for on ‘.arodroma at ibah* 3)• D .0. 1 • said that a survey would have to be aade there.

The serried could be operated more expeditiously by dispensing with one night s‘ op at compared with the flying boat proposal (Dihah would be the only night stop in the Gulf if X?: t ndplanes were used) and would also be cheaper regards initial and recurring costs to the Air Ministry. ~'.,•. said that if there rare cogent reasons why lan Ip lanes should be used which had not been brought to the notice of the interdepartmental Committee, it was right that the Committee should know of them. I.£.0.1. expressed some doubt as to whether the Committee would be disposed to consider a hypothetical ease and thought they would want concrete proposals with an estimate of cost. ’ The treasury were more avers© from accepting 'Consequential risks' than known initial and recurring charges.

Sir, At th# meeting hold at th.® Air Ministry on th© 21st aroh on th© subjeot of th© Persian situation, the Director of Civil Aviation asked for a statement oi our views on the advantages and disadvantages In comparison between the use of our Hannibal type land 'planes and the Calcutta type flying boats on the Arabian Coast route of the Persian Gulf, history, and, in view of the remarks of the Director of Civil Aviation in opening the meeting, we think it as well to place on record a few of the events which have led us to suggest, even though it be a last minute suggestion, a final consideration of the possibilities of utilising our present type of land 'planes rather than flying boats. and rapidly changing art that it is essential to review fairly frequently problems which may have been considered finally disposed of, in order that the latest knowledge and experience can be focussed upon then. I am to 9% r that this question of altering the route to the Arabian side of th® Gulf has been discussed and reviewed for some years, but it is only during the last few months that we have been able t© see the effect of the greatly improved performance of our latest type of land Y planes, vis: The Hannibal type. Until then, therefore,^ our considerations of land 'planes versus flying boats were | inevitably based upon a comparison between the Calcutta type of aircraft and the 13.H.66. The Arabian coast route has always appeared to be fraught with sufficient difficult and unknown problems? that it obviously unwise to introduce another in the shape ©£' f in unknown aircraft. How th*t these new type of land aircraft have settled down to a reliable operating routine nninion that it is wise to review the possibility As a rule, little harm comes of recapitulating past considerations of the Arabian coast route cm the use of Calcutta flying boats.than at present• It is not necessary to quote previous correspondence or notes of meetings f but we have all along stated that the change of fleet to flying boats down the Persian Gulf must very seriously set back the commercial development of the service, and It Is the view of my Board that to couple with that an additional day in the timetable will so affect the commercial development that a review of the whole financial side of the agreement will be necessary. Under these circumstances, the Air Oouncil will no doubt appreciate the Company's attitude in striving its utmost to maintain the underlying principle of the agreement for the India service, which was its continual progressive advancement towards commercial Independence• The Oman Peninsula is approxkmately the half way point between Basra and Karachi* An aerodrome and night resthouse, say, near Dibah would permit the present schedule to be operated and would avoid the Increase of a day owing tc it being impossible to stay the night at *as-el-Khalmah• The advantages of using land aircraft arej- 1.

The subject matter is the establishment of an aerodrome on the Trucial Coast to facilitate the transfer of Imperial Airways' Europe-India route from Southern Persia to the Arabian Coast. There is some material related to the selection of a suitable site. However, much of the file is concerned with negotiations with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, Ruler of Sharjah; Sharjah was selected by British officials as the most promising site for a landing ground. The file therefore contains a number of reports on the political situation at Sharjah, the progress of negotiations, and discussion over terms and conditions. A copy of the final agreement can be found on folios 225-228.The agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah provided for the construction of a rest house to be owned by the Shaikh but rented by Imperial Airways. The file therefore includes discussion relating to arrangements for the financing and construction of the rest house. There is also a detailed consideration of the measures needed to ensure its security, and measures to be taken by British forces in the event of an attack on the facility: see folios 18-27 for a copy of the
                           Sharjah Defence Scheme.The file also contains discussion between British officials over their response to the following two proposals submitted by the Government of the Netherlands: a proposal for Anglo-Dutch-French co-operative partnership in approaching civil aviation matters linking Europe and the Far East, with a particular view to negotiations with Persia; and a request for access to the Arab Coast air route.In addition to the immediate response to the Netherlands Government, the file includes discussion related to how British policy over the Trucial Coast should develop in response to developments in civil aviation.Also contained within the file are a number of papers circulated by the Committee of Imperial Defence's Standing Official Sub-committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East. These papers relate to a proposal from Imperial Airways to use landplanes along the Arabian Coast route instead of flying boats; the file contains extensive technical comparisons between the ‘Hannibal’ four engine landplane (the Handley Page H.P.42) and three engine ‘Calcutta’ flying boat (the Short S.8).There is a limited amount of discussion, towards to front of the correspondence, over the state of British negotiations with Persia. However, this is not the focus of the file.A couple of letters from the Government of the Netherlands are in French (see folios 296-301) and the final agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah (folios 225-228) is in both English and Arabic. The vast majority of the file is in English.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Hugh Vincent Biscoe, and later Trenchard Craven William Fowle), the Political Agent at Kuwait (Harold Richard Patrick Dickson), and the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf. It also includes correspondence with officials of the following governmental departments: the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India.Most of the material in the file covers the period 1932 to 1935. Only a single letter, dated 31 March 1940, falls outside this range.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><subject><topic>Short S.8 Calcutta (Seaplane)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Handley Page H.P. 42 (Transport plane)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Security of property</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aircraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Seaplanes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
