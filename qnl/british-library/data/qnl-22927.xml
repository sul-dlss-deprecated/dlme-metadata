NorU.O.0/267. Political Agency, Bahrain,the 13th July 1933. My dear Belgrave, It is possible that K.S Aga Mirza Ali Asghar Khan, TALIQANI, the Cxovernor of Bushire and the 'Southern Ports and Apana.ges' may be on the Up Slow Mail steamer due here from LINGEH on or about the 16th Julv. The Governor of Bushire has been on a tour of the Persian Pdrts as far south ad Charbar and is now at Lirgeh. The Slow Mail is his only way out of that place (other than Persian sloop),and I write to warn you,as I think some arrangement should be made to keep H.E on board as I think you’ll agree his landing,even in a purely private or tourist capacity might start an international situation,and that woul never do! Actually H.E is a charming person,but that makes it no easier. Perhaps v/e could discuss ways and means at some convenient time? Yours sincerely, C.D.Belgrave Esquire, Bahrain.tlie Governor of Buahire Jmcl eiabariced on the ’Barpeta 1 at Lingeh, The poseihilitiy of the Governor of Bushire being on board had been mentioned to the Shaikh that morning and he agreed that it was moat unwise to allow him to land, should he by any chance wish to do so. H, In the evening Belgrade and I dlscuased the matter and it was decided that the best way out of the difficulty was to arrange that tae Chief of the Bahrain Btate Police should go on board this evening (6 P.ii) and be ready to inform the Governor politely that it was regx'eited that it was not possible lor him to lanu. This message would only be conveyed to him should ho show any inclination to do so. At the same time lo ^revem, ixnjr popular demonstration by the Persians,Belgrave and fiuoaeil thought it a ^ood opportunity to restrict the ever increasing owaxm cl visitors to ships in harbour. Fox some time past,Captains of the slow mail steamers have complained bitterly that crowds,which swarm on to their ships will one day break down the gangway,so Belgrave has prepared a notice for the Shaikh*s signature to the effect that from today no casual visitor can leave the shore without a permit to do so. 3. These are the arrangements that we have made and we hope that there will be no incident.0 ENCLOSURE IN FOREIGN OFFICE COVERING LETTER DATED 8th APRIL 1940.
