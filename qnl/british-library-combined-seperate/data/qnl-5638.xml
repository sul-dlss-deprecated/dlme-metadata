The concession to mine the red oxide there was held, and later lost by Haji Agha Mohamed, Muin-ut-Tujjar (also spelled Mouin and Moin) [Haji Agha Muhammad, Mu‘in ul-Tujjār]. The negotiations were complicated by the involvement of a German syndicate, which also wanted to obtain control of the business. The file covers the contractual, legal, and diplomatic progress of the negotiations in detail.The papers consist of correspondence from senior officials at the Foreign Office and the India Office, particularly the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey) and the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Louis du Pan Mallet); the Board of Trade; the British Minister at Tehran (Sir Charles Murray Marling, later Sir George Barclay, and Sir Walter Beaupré Townley) and the three British firms involved in the negotiations: Ellinger and Company, Frank C Strick and Company, and Andrew Weir and Company.The French language content of the file is limited to a single letter on folio 41.The volume includes a divider which gives the subject, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Andrew Weir Group</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ellinger and Company, shipping merchants</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Frank C Strick and Company Limited, shipping company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Under-Secretary of State in Charge of Near and Middle Eastern Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Haji Agha Muḥammad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Hormuz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ferric oxide</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00002f#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00002f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00002f#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00002f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
