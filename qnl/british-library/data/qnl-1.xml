A copy of a letter received from Yousuf bin Ahmed Kanoo is enclosed. 2 ' The difficulty appears to be that the out going mails for each aircraft are required to be delivered to British Overseas Airways. Corporation 45 minutes before the expected time of arrival of the aircraft so that they can be weighed and entered in the manifests. In»coming Airways Corporation to the contractor until 45 minutes after the aircraft has landed, thus, to deliver and collect mails in one trip, the contractor has to keep his hired transport wtofcing 1^ hours. He is willing to keep it waiting li hours, but not longer. When aircraft do not arrive coming mails on his next trip to British Overseas Airways Corporation. A s the remuneration for the mail contract was calculated on the basis of two trips a day only, I do not feel that the contractor can be expected to make more trips without a proportionate increase in the rates of his contract.
