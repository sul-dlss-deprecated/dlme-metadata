THE CAREERS OP SALEH BIS ALI AND HIS SON ISA BIN SALEH THE STORMY PETRELS OP OMAN POLITICS.SHEIKH SALEH Biff ALI. Saleh bin All bin Nasir of the El Harth tribe residing at Kabil in A1 Sharkiyah, first became noto rious from his connection with the conspiracy against Saiyid Majid at Zanzibar in 1859. Three of the prime movers in the plot to create a revolution were Saiyid Barghash, Sheikh Saleh, and Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim al Harithi, but a fourth conspirator was Saiyid Hamad bin Salim who had been sent from Muscat in the early part of the year by Saiyid Thoweynee to distribute money among the Harth tribe and induce them to rise. Saiyid Thoweynee’s object was to reunite Zanzibar to Muscat, to get rid of Majid, and to appoint Barghash Wali on his behalf. Saiyid Barghash’s plan was very different. He was very willing to fall in with Thoweynee’s scheme so far as getting rid of Majid was concerned but his intention was then to make himself independent. It was not long before Thoweynee found he had been befooled by the Harth and withdrew from the affair. Saiyid Bar ghash, however, under the guidance and advice of Sheikh Saleh, attempted to assassinate Majid, and failing to do so, rose in open rebellion and endeavoured to obtain French interference. By the middle of 1859, with the support of British ships, the revolt was put down and order restor ed, but in October it broke out again. Barghash and Saleh bin Ali, having collected all the younger chil dren of Saiyid Saeed with their mothers in Barghash’s house, placed several barrels of gunpowder in the lower storey and threatened to blow them all up if Majid used( used force. Subsequently the conspirators retired and fortified a house in the interior of the island where they were attacked and defeated by Majid’s force led by British officers from the •I^ynx” and ’’Assaye”* Saleh bin Ali then fled to the mainland from whence he escaped to Oman and proceeded to El Kabil. Very soon after Saiyid Thoweynee’s death he joined forces with Said bin Khalfan al Khalili, the leader of the Mutawwa or extremist movement in the Ibadhi sect who had first come into prominence in 1841 when Saiyid Hamud of Sohar placed him in charge of his principal forts to hold them against the Wahabis. In 1868, Sheikh Saleh wrote to Saiyid Azzan to take the lead, as they had organized a rising. Azzan then marched on Barka and took it. From thence the rebels marched on Muscat which was captured and Sheikh Saleh became Wazir, dividing the power with Khalili. In 1871, Saiyid Turki successfully assaulted Matrah, Saiyid Azzan being killed in the fight. Saleh was at that time away in the interior, but Khalili, who was in charge of the forts at Muscat came to terms with Turki through the intervention of the Political Resi dent. In spite of this agreement, Saiyid Turki had Khalili and his son walled up alive in Merani fort. Saleh’s next appearance was in 1874, when, on hearing false rumours of Saiyid Turki’s death, he appeared on the 18th of January before Matrah, which he soon occupied. He had brought Azzan’s son Hamood with him as a puppet; but, finding Turki was not dead, he retired on receiving payment of 6000/-. In June 1877, Sheikh Saleh organised a rising of the Sharkiyah tribes and invited Saiyid Ibrahim bin Kais to join him, an invitation which Ibrahim was so ill advised as to accept. After a siege of four days, the rebels7 the rebels had to retire discomfited and Saleh lost much of his reputation and prestige by this failure. In 1883, making use of dissensions among the Ghafiris, Saleh formed a fresh coalition of the Shar- kiyah tribes in favour of Saiyid Abdul Aziz. Saiyid Abdul Aziz led three forlorn hopes against the walls of Muscat but was repulsed with heavy loss and the expedition resulted in failure after a siege of six days In 1688, when Saiyid Faisal came to the throne Saleh responded in loyal terms to the announcement of his succession. In 1889-90 during the rebellion of Abdul Aziz and Hamud the Jahafi, Saleh supported the Sultan. This support was retained only till 1894, when Saiyid Faisal alienated it by showing favout to another Harithi Sheikh, Saeed bin Ali, with a view. Sheikh Saleh believed, to undermining the latters influence in the Sharkiyah. In February 1895, Sheikh Saleh’s son Abdullah, Sheikh Hamood al Gahafi, and Sheikh Mohsin bin Amir al Harithi arrived at Muscat, each with a small following. The three Chiefs were received with hospitality by the Sultan, who after according them an audience, dismissed them with the usual presents: they intimated their intention of leaving Muscat the same night or early the next morning. After dark a number of their followers who had not been allowed to enter Muscat, made their way into the town in parties of two’s and three's, not without exciting the suspicions of the Hydrami and Wahabi soldiers of the Sultan. The latter hastened to inform their master, who thus had ample warning of the treacherous designs of his visitors. The warning was entirely disregarded, the Sultan refusing to believe that so long as the Chiefs and their followers were in the town as his guests, they could be guilty of so gravegrave a breach of Arab hospitality as to take advantage of their position to attack their host. He was speedily undeceived, for at daybreak on the 13th, his palace was suddenly attacked and the rebels, having overpowered the few guards on duty, proceeded in the direction of his sleeping apartments with the intention of taking his life. The Sultan, supported by some of his followers, offered a deter mined resistance, but after keeping his assailants at bay for some time, was compelled to retire over the tops of some Banias houses with his family to the British Consulate, from whence he went to Fort Jelali. After three weeks of desultory warfare, the Sultan opened negociations with Sheikh Saleh;on March 9th it was announced that peace had been concluded. It was subsequently learned that the rebels received some thousands of rupees as the price of their retirement. In 1896, Saleh bin Ali was killed by a random shot whilst taking part in an attack on Saijah. His son Abdullah predeceased him. He had undoubted abilities and a fine talent for intrigue, and was in his time the acknowledged leader of the Matawwa party.SHEIKH ISA BIN SALEH. Isa bin Saleh, the son and successor of Saleh bin Ali, first came into prominence in 1900, when he was making overtures for the active support of Sheikh Abdullah bin Saeed al Khalili of the Bani Ruwahah,(son of the famous Khalili who in 1869, in conjunction with Saleh bin Ali, assisted Azzan bin ^ais to assume power in Muscat) for the purpose of an attack on Muscat. On this occasion Isa failed in his object owing to the fact that Saiyid Faisal had managed to win over the allegiance of Sheikh Saeed during a tour of the Semail valley which he had carried out just previously. In 1901 some geologists were sent by the Government of India to examine certain coal deposits near Sur. Realising that organised obstructions to the geologists* movements afforded a convenient means of annoying and blackmailing the Sultan, Isa and his broth ers collected a considerable retinue and for some weeks barred the progress of the exploring party, finally contriving a treacherous ambuscade which only good luck prevented from being jfraught with serious consequence. He was then stated to be a dignified and serious character with a considerable reputation for asceticism and piety of somewhat bigotted type and no small con fidence in his own astuteness as a politician. In these respects, the mantle of his father had fallen on him, whilst his younger brothers, Ali and Ahmed, were rest less ne*er-do-wells of a troublesome type but possessed of little personal reputation or influence. In August 1903 Isa bin Saleh was concerned in a movement to place Sa*id bin Ibrahim bin Qais, a memberIO member of a rival branch of the Sultan’s family,(and nephew of Azzan bin ^ais whom Saleh bin Ali assisted) on the throne. In a letter to the Sultan, Isa bin Saleh informed him naively by clear insinuation if not in so many words that Said had been chosen Imam, or as he put it, invested with the affairs of Muslimeen. Isa realised that he himself, whatever his religious qualifications might be, was not of suffic iently aristocratic descent to gain the approval of the , ' d majority, and that next to his own candiature, the A selection of a weak candidate like Said bin Ibrahim who would be a puppet in his hands, would be the best alternative. This was the policy which his father and Khalili had pursued with some success at the beginning of the reign of Azzan bin Qais. Said bin Ibrahim, how ever, had neither the moral nor religious reputation to win general support from the people of Oman, whose formally expressed approval is a sine qua non of the confirmation of any candidate as Imam, and it soon became a foregone conclusion that the movement would be abortive. After a protracted stay at Rostaq, Isa and his followers returned to the Sharqiyah in February 1904. During 1905, the movements of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh were the cause of some anxiety. Saiyid Faisal credited Isa with having inherited his father’s enmity towards him and believed he was only waiting for suf ficient power and a favourable opportunity to make himself objectionable* In September 1905, Sheikh Isa attempted a reconciliation with the Sultan. He asked H.H.’s permission to visit Semail and returned a valuable swoed which had been plundered from Muscat during the 1895 rebellion. The Sultan saw no reason to refuse this request and sentI sent Saiyid Muhammad bin Ahmad, Wali of Matrah, to meet him. The Sheikh arrived in Semail in October with about 400 followers and at once despatched Abdullah bin Humaid as Salimi, a well known Mutawwa priest, with 25 men to visit His Highness Isa also sent a message to the Sultan begging to be allowed to visit him per sonally. H.H. after consultation with the Political Agent, replied there was no objection provided he came with a few followers only. Distrust on the part of Sheikh Isa prevented his accepting these terms and the meeting did not come off. During 1906 the intrigues of Isa and his / friends were much in evidence. They made attempts to cajole Saiyid Taimur, the eldest son of the Sultan, by working upon his youthful religious feelings and urging him to a stricter following of the Muslim Creed than that adopted by his father. The object of these man oeuvres was to obtain access to the Sultan himself by means of influence over his son, or failing that, to sow distrust or even enmity between the Prince and his father. At one time it seemed possible that their schemes would be to some extent successful; namely when early in November of that year. Sheikh Ali, brother of Sheikh Isa, who had been brought to Riyam one mile from Muscat, was refused entrance to Muscat itself, to the disap pointment of Saiyid Taimur who had become convinced not only that the feelings of the Harithis towards the ruling house had undergone a change but that his views regarding them were shared by his father. In February 1907, Tali Sulaiman bin Suwaylim was despatched to Sheikh Isa by the Sultan in order to obtain the former’s assurance that he would not oppose a plan the Sultan had formed to bring Said/bin Ibrahim of Rostaq© »7L /-N of Rostaq under control. Wall Sulaiman was received with every sign of welcome but was treacherously mur dered in a defile of the Aqq pass during his return journey. The late hosts of the deceased Wali were open to grave suspicion of having been party to the murder, in which the Siabiyin, a Ghafiri tribe, were also im plicated. Finally H.H. the Sultan, growing tired of the inaction and deceit practiced by Sheiks Isa bin Saleh and Seif bin Moshin of the Siabiyin in not deliver ing up the murderers of Wali Sulaiman, despatched some emissaries who murdered Sheikh Seif bin Mohsin at Bid- bid, an act for which Sir Saiyid Faisal rewarded the emissaries suitably. In 1912, after the establishment of the Arms Warehouse, rumours were constantly arriving of an impending universal rising of-the Bedouins on account of the restrictions in the Arms Traffic. H.H. also received a threatening letter from Isa. Prior to 1913, rebellions failed because of the rapid rallying of the Ghafiri tribes to the succour of the Sultan and the fact that the movements engin eered by Sheikh Saleh never had the full support of the most important of the Hinawi tribes who were not all devoted to Sheikh Saleh’s cause. Isa was clever enough to see where previous revolutions had failed and to perceive the wisdom of bringing in the Ghafiris first in order to make the movement a communal one in Oman. In May 1913, Sheikh Abdullah bin Humaid al Salimi, Isa’s emissary of 1906, the Chief Mullah of the Ibadhi sect, who was also religious tutor to the sons of Isa, appeared as the leader of the new rising and appointed as Imam his disciple and son-in-law Salim bin Hashidbin Rashid al Kharusi(Ghafiri). Isa did not openly join the rebellion immediately although there is no doubt that he was the hidden power behind the scenes from the commencement* It was joined by Hamyar bin Nasir al Nebhani of the Bani Riyam tribe of Ghafiris. Ss Salirai went about raising the tribes. Hie method was to misrepresent the Arms Warehouse as a subtle device of the English for depriving the Oman tribes of modern weapons and especially of ammunition, so that they might reduce the tribes to impotence and then ride roughshod over them. Ghafiris and Hinawis alike declared their allegiance but the main body of the latter faction only came in when Isa openly attached himself to the movement. The rebellion spread rapidly. Nizwah fell about the beginning of June; Izki and Awabi followed in the course of the month. Shortly after this the fort at Semail was invested and H.H. asked for assistance from the British Government. In July, a wing of the 2nd Rajputs landed for the defense of Muscat and Matrah in accordance with the terms of our guarantee. About this time the Bani Bu Ali, who had come to the support of the Sultan, retreated unaccountably and unexpectedly from Bidbid whilst the Shihuh contingent retreated to Sohar. In the beginning of August the forts of Bidbid and Semail passed into the rebels* hands. After the death of Saiyid Faisal (4th October 1913) Saiyid Tairaur hoped that the friendly feelings which had existed between himself and Sheikh Isa bin Saleh would enable him to gain over that Chief as well as other Hinawiyah Sheikhs. In November, Sheikh Hamdan bin Zaid of Abu Dhabi attempted to intervene and wentto Sib for this purpose accompanied toy certain Chiefs of the Hawasinah and Bani tou Hassan. They met SneiKh Isa toin Saleh and his brother Ali. The remaining rebel leaders refused to join the conference. On the 9th December Sheikh Isa proceeded to Muscat and interviewed H.H. Nothing came of this meeting and the Imam continued to give trouble throughout 1914. In January 1915, the threatened attack on Muscat and Matrah took place. A force of Arabs estimated at about 3,000 attacked the British outpost line and met with a crushing defeat; their casualties being estimated at 350 whilst the British casualties were 7 killed and 15 wounded. After this defeat of the rebels, Saiyid Taimur considered it expedient to follow up this success with a force of his own Askaris and Bani Omar with the object of seizing the forts of Bidbid and Semail and thus consolidating the success we had gained for him. He desisted from doing so on the advice of the Political Agent who considered that there was a possibility of the good effects of the recent victory being lost by a disastrous reverse to His Highness’s Arab following whose heart was in no way in the fight* Negotiations were then opened with the various Sheikhs of the Semail valley through the mediation of Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad of the Naim tribe of Baraimi for the purpose of arriving at a settlement with the rebels. Most of the Sheikhs of Semail appeared ready to negotiate with the exception of Muhammad bin Abdullah al Khalili who, posing as the spokesman of his tribe,' made excuses on the grounds that it would be a great disgrace for them to abandon the fort of Semail, the custody of which was entrusted to them and of whichof which they were constituted the neutral guardians. These overtures for peace were generally regarded as evidence of weakness by the inhabitants, and as a sign that we were being hard pressed by the Germans and desired to withdraw the Muscat garrison. During this time the Sultan appears to have been engaged expending his energies and resources against the Bani Battash, a tribe whose headquarters are at Hail, a few miles inland from ^uriyat. This tribe was independent of the Imam and was merely a gang of marau ders whose depredations had been causing some trouble. His Highness was successful in these operations. The tribe surrendered and the Sultan’s authority was re established in Hail and the surrounding district. The year 1916 was marked by numerous defec tions from the Sultan’s cause. By September the only fort which he held in the Dhahirah had fallen, and at the end of the year His Highness’s power extended only along the coast and practically as far as the guns of British ships can carry. The Imam continued to confis cate the very considerable property and gardens in the interior owned by the Sultan or his relatives, or owned by people serving His Highness. In 1917, Rostaq, which was held by Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim bin Qais, fell to the rebels. His Highness’s attempt to relieve this garrison met with ill success owing to the desertion of his followers led by the Sheikh of Baraimi. Saiyid Taimur had been anxious to obtain the assistance of British troops and had previously asked if Government would assist him if he could raise a force of some 2000 or 3000 men. Circumstances and the importunity of those around him had led him to take action which in its result showed© showed his absolute helplessness at this stage to meet the situation in which he was placed. By this time it was beginning to become apparent that the rebellion had resulted in a disorganization of the Sultan’s ad ministration, whilst the prolongation of hostilities had placed His Highness very heavily in debt. During 1918, there were continual rumours of attacks by the Imam on Sur, Yankel, or Baraimi, but the Imam’s resources had been used up in the capture of Rostaq and financial reasons prevented any further operations by the Omanis. Much attention appears to have been paid during this year to the question of Hie Highness’s administration, a scheme being drawn up for the better government of Oman and for the provision of a force for the Sultan. Proposals were submitted for a loan of 5i lakhs to the Sultan, should he agree to make improve ments in his administration by instituting a proper customs service under the control of an official se lected by H.M.8s Govt; by the provision of proper courts of justice; by the founding of schools on modern lines; and by the formation of a Levy Corps trained by Native Officers from India, and supervised by a British officer. These proposals were sanctioned by the Secretary of State in December, 1918, and were agreed to by the Sultan in 1919. In 1919, His Highness gave the Political Agent carte blanche to deal with the situation. A meeting took place at Sib in September between the Political Agent and Sheikh Isa bin Saleh, and terms of a settlement on the basis of the status quo were agreed to. The Imam, however, on the instigation of certain Mullahs, refused to agree to a clause requiring the return of certain valuable gardens, the property of \n of the Sultan’s subjects and which the rebels had seized. The negotiations proved fruitless. The Sultan proceeded to India on the 3rd March, 1920, where he declared his intention to abdi cate. Naval action had to be taken on the Batinah coast, and arrears of customs at Sur had to be collected with the presence of a man-of-war, as the inhabitants of these places were by this time also becoming rest less. A penal zakat of from 5% to 25^ was imposed on all goods coming from the Interior. These measures had considerable effect on the interior and in July the Imam Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi was murdered. Isa bin Saleh thereupon succeeded in obtaining the election of his father-in-law. Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdullah al Khalili, a grandson of the Khalili previously mentioned.as Imam. He then obtained the return of the gardens and reopened negotiations with the Political Agent whom he met once more at Sib. The following terms were finally agreed to:« The Sultan’s Government would (1) Reduce the zakat on all goods coming to the coast towns to b%' 9 (2) Guarantee safety and freedom for Omanis in the coast towns; (3) Remove all restrictions on the entry of Omanis into Muscat and Matrah; (4) Return fugitives from their justice and not interfere in their internal affairs. The Omanis would (1) Remain at peace with the Sultan, not attack the coast, and not interfere with his Government; (2) Permit freedom of trade and travel in Oman and guarantee the safety of travellers; (3) Would return and not protect fugitives fromSheikh SALHH BIU ALI. Saleh bin Ali bin Nasir of the El Harth tribe residing at Kabil in A1 Sharkiyah,first became notorious from his connection with the conspiracy against Saiyid Majid at Zanzibar in 1859. Three of the prime movers in the plot to create a revolution were Saiyid Barghash,Shaikh Saleh and Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim al Harithi.but a fourth conspirator w as Saiyid Hamad bin Salim Tv ho had been sent from Muscat in the early part of the year by Saiyid Thoweynee to distribute money among the Harth tribe and induce them to rise. Saiyid Thoweyjiee’s object was to reunite Zanzibar to Muscat,to get rid of Majid and to appoint Barghesh Wall on his behalf. Saiyid Barghesh^ plan was very different. He was very willing to fall in with Thoweynee f s scheme so far as getting rid of Majid was concerned but his intention was then to make himself independant. It was not long before Thoweynee found he had been befooled by the Harth and witndrew from the affair. Saiyid Barghesh,however,trader the guidance and advice of Sheikh Saleh,attempted to assasinate Majid ind,failing to do so,rose in open rebellion and endeavoured to obtain French interferance. By the middle of 1859,with the support of British ships the revolt was put down and order restored.but in Octobe r it orolce out ayain and Barghesh and Saleh bin Ali having collected all the younger children of Saiyid Saeed with weir rcotners in Barghash's house,placed several barrels of gunpowder in the lower story and threatened to blow(lo) to them all up if Majid used force. Subsequently the conspirators retired and fortified a house in the interior of the island where they were attacked and defeated by Majids foree led by British offocers from the Lynx and Assaye. Saleh bin Ali then fled to the mainland from whence he escaped to Oman and proceeded to El Kabil, Very soon after Saiyid Thoweynee*s death,he began with El Khalili to intrigue against Saiyid Salim and in 1868.wrote to Saiyid Azzan to take the lead as they had organised a rising. Azzan then marched on Barka and took it.From thence the rebels marched on Muscat which was captured and Sheikh Saleh then became T »7azir dividing the power with Khalili. He was not present in Muscat at the time of Azzans death when Saiyid Turki came into power. His next appearance was in 1874, when,on hearing false rumours of Saiyid Turki's death,he appeared on the 18th Jany. before Matrah which he soon occupied. He had brought Azzan 1 s son Hamoud with him as a puppet; but,finding Turki ^as not dead,retired on receiving payment of % 6000/-. In June 1877,Sheikh Saleh organised a rising of the Sharkiyah tribes and invited Saiyid Ibrahim bin Kais to j^in him,an invitation which Ibrahim was so ill advised as to accent. After a siege of four days,the rebels had to retire discomlited and Saleh l^st much of his reputation and prestige by his failure. In /! 883,making use of dissensions among the Ghafiris Saleh formed a fresh coalition of the Sharkiyah tribes in favour of Saiyid Abdul Aziz. Saiyid Abdul Aziz led three forlorn hopes against the walls of Muscat but was repulsed with heavy loss and the expedition resulted in failure after a siege of six days. In 1888,when Saiyid Faisal came on the throne,Salehm. nm ' * ■s~s 71 responded in loyal terms to the announcement of his succession. In 1889-90 during the rebellion of Abdul Aziz and Hamud the Jahafi,Saleh su pported the Sultan. This support ir as retained only till 1894,when he ali- enated it by showing favour to another Harithi sheikh, Saeed bin Ali, with a view,Sheikh Saleh believed,to undermining the latters influence in the Sharkiyah. In February 1895,Sheikh Saleh 1 s son Abdullah,Sheikh Hamood al Gahafi,and Sheikh Mohsin bin Amir al Harithi arrived at Muscat,each with a small following. The three chiefs were received with hospitality by the Sultan,who,after according them an audience,dismissed them ^ith the usual presents,and they intimated their intention of leaving Muscat the same night or early the next morning. After dark, a n*tfnber of their follower who had not been allowed to enter Muscat,made their way into the town in parties of twos and threes,not without exciting the suspicions,however, of the Hydrami and h’ahabi soldiers of the Sultan.

The warning was entirely disregarded,the Sultan refusing to believe that so long as the Chiefs and their followers were in the town as his guests,they could be guilty of sci grave a breach of the rules of Arab hospitality as to take advantage of their position to attack their host.
