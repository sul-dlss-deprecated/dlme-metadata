The Headquarters of the Company would not require any (para. 14 of the BAHREIN Defence Appreciation refers). 4. \7ith reference to para. 3 of my letter of 26th June, if INDIA are intending to re-arm with 'Bren” guns at an early date it should be possible to procure ^Vickero-Berthiers' from any reserves they may have in stock. 5i I suggest It might be possible to obtain, on loan * from IN IE A sufficient dicker s-Berthiers” to arm the ' AIRNXIT Police and for the other Persian Gulf stations.
