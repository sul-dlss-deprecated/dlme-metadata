                  <summary>Recto: part of a letter, c. 1050 CE, probably from the Jewish community of Damascus, to the Jewish community in Fusṭāṭ, regarding their persecution by the Bedouin tribes who have usurped control of the city (they refer to them as 'Arabs', rather than the usual term for Muslims, 'Goyim', drawing a distinction, probably, between uncivilised and civilised behaviour). The harsh measures enacted against the Jewish community, by the city's leaders and the qadi known as 'the nephew of Abū l-Sayyār (Ibn Uḵt Abū l-Sayyār), inlude denying them access to the city's water supply, forbidding them to slaughter animals, and the extortion of special taxes. When a new Fāṭimid governor arrived to restore order, Ḥaydara 'Treasure of the Realm', the Jewish community presented him with a decree obtained from the court in Cairo. Ḥaydara read the decree and then demanded a bribe to remove the restrictions on the Jews. Verso: Unrelated text in Arabic

            <p>... The increase of our iniquities caused the hand of the Arabs to strengthen its
               rule, until, growing bold, the tyrants of the city, its notables, its elders and the
               qadi there, called ‘the Nephew of Abū l-Sayyār’ — May the name of the wicked rot! —
               conspired to cut off our water supply. For they said ‘How can the Hebrews drink from
               our water?’. And whenever we called on a leader or governor to reopen our access to
               the water, they would gather and attest that ‘They have no share or legal right over
               our water’. This went on until the arrival this year of the governor called Ḥaydara
               ‘Treasure of the Realm’. We saw that his hand ruled over the people of the city and
               the surrounding area. So we sent our emissary to Egypt to obtain a letter and a
               decree to deal with three matters: to reopen the water supply to us as it was
               previously; to allow us to slaughter in the market according to the law, because they
               (i.e. the locals) had prevented us from slaughtering; and that the collection of tax
               should be from the beginning of the month called al-Muḥarram until the month called
               Du-‘l Hijja, and they should not take tax from us until the beginning of the year.
               Our emissary came back and brought with him the decree dealing with the
               aforementioned three points. We took the papers and we went, a group of us, to the
               governor Ḥaydara. He took the decree and some letters that we had brought to him from
               the ‘Notable of the Realm’ and other important people in the government, and he read
               them, before throwing them from his hand and seeking to obtain a bribe for doing all
               that they contained. And so we went away afflicted and troubled, and we made a
               collection from every side and corner until we had given him a great many dinars,
               thus depriving the poor, the orphans and widows, after cries, trouble and distress.
               We also gave bribes to his officials and retinue, until we had been refined like the
               refining of silver and the testing of gold. After all this he send for an elder
               called ‘the Preacher’ who testified before him that the Jews had previously enjoyed
               rights to the water… And so the day came that he reopened the water for us, and all
               the elders, the young men and all the notables of the city gathered and testified
               before him saying: ‘They have no legal right to share our water and they have no
               share among us in this city’. He replied to them: ‘My lord the Caliph has spoken and
               has enacted a decree: I will not negate a word of it until you bring me from him
               another decree like this one but an annulment of it’. When they heard this, everyone
               got up from in front of him in shame and reproach. He said to the qadi of the city:
               ‘Look I have reopened the water for them; now I am returning to you alone the edict
               concerning their slaughtering because you alone can enact the edict’. The qadi left
               him as he was and the next day our destitution began. The governor heard of the
               arrival of soldiers (to his jurisdiction) and so he sent word to the Jews and sought
               to obtain the tax for the forthcoming year, five months in advance. He said, ‘I
               desire two hundred and fifty dinars from you. I will not speak to you again till
               after the end of next year…’</p>
