Hachures are used to show relief, and a brief note explains the map's sources. The map was published in June 1893 by the Intelligence Division, War Office, sheet no. 985.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>First Assistant Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of France, Third Republic</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Military Intelligence</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Perim Island</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100086630218.0x000001#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100086630218.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
