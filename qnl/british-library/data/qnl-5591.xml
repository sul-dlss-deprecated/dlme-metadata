The damage to our prestige would be all the more serious if, as would now be the case, it were public knowledge that we had authorised resistance to Persian interference outside Persian territorial waters. It would therefore seem necessary, if the risk of incidents is to be avoided in the manner suggested by Lord Halifax for Ships to be instructed to keep, not only outside the aix-mile limit, but at a distance from it sufficient to ensure that they did not witness any incident occurring within the six miles, or likely to involve pursuit beyond that limit. My Lords do not, however, consider that any such instruction would be desirable in principle or practical; those suggested by Lord Ralifax would not, in fact, avoid the risk of incidents, and would, ly Loras consider, merely introduce an undesirable element of doubt in Commanding Officers * instructions which would make a decision in particular cases difficult and embarrassing. As explained in Admiralty letter k.03427/37 of the 10th September, 1937, they do not consider that the risk of a serious incident arising is great, and, for the reasons explained above, they would be glad if Lord Halifax could agree to the issue of the instructions without the proposed reservation. 4. Uy Lords have also conoiaered the proposal that H..i. Ships should undertake to see tnat suspected vessels proceed to their alleged destination, arid that offences are investigated and punished. To be effective, this would involve escorting the dhow to its alleged destination. The actual destination of such dhows would presumably be generally within Persian waters; the alleged destination alight be anywhere, and an undertaking to escort suspected dhows would therefore be unacceptable for operational reasons. As regards the investigation/investigation and punishment of offences, Their Lordships con sider that the proposal in paragraph 9 of Admiralty letter of 10th Septernb-r, 1957, would he sufficient to cover cases of suspected arms running. It is observed, however, that the activities of fersian warships appeer at present to be mainly seem possible for any undertaking to be given that offences which are offences only against Persian law will be investigated and punished elsewhere. 5.

Sir, Vvith reference to your letter M. 03427/37 of the 10th September, 1937, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the accompanying copies of correspondence with His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, in the course of which Mr. Seymour makes certain observations regarding the attitude to be adopted by the Commanding Officers of His Majesty's ships in cas^ of Persian interference with Arab dhows. 2. As Their Lordships will see from paragraph 3 of Mr. Seymour's despatch, he considers that any incident involving one of His Majesty’s ships and an Iranian vessel, in waters which, although beyond the three mile limit, are claimed by the Iranian Government as territorial, would give rise to great bitterness, and that it is therefore preferable to avoid the risk of any such incident occurring 3. Lord Halifax is aware that interference by a Persian ship with an Arab dhow is more likely to take place in waters near the Persian coast and an oral assurance has, moreover, already been given by the Persian Government that Persian warships will not molest Arab vessels The Secretary of the Admiralty.vessels in Arab territorial waters or on the high seas. At the same time, while fully conscious of the ill-feeling which would result if one of His Majesty’s ships were to take measures involving a Persian vessel within the six mile limit, His Lordship realises that the effect produced on the Rulers of the Arab coast if one of His Majesty’s ships failed to protect a dhow in waters which, as the Arab Rulers know perfectly well, His Majesty’s Government do not regard as Persian territorial waters, might be equally unfortunate. It is, moreover, probable that Persian susceptibilities would be outraged in whatever waters the incident occurred. 4. Lord Halifax is therefore of the opinion that the balance of advantage lies in including waters outside the three mile limit, but within the six mile limit, in the scope of the proposed Admiralty instructions. 5. His Lordship is, however, anxious that, in the issue of these instructions the following points should be emphasized: (a) That the instructions must be carried out (as he has no doubt Their Lordships intend) with the utmost tact and discretion, and force be used only in the very last resort. (b) That in all cases, and not only in arms cases, His Majesty’s ships shall inform the Persian vessel that they are themselves prepared to verify the flag and the papers of the dhow in question, to see, if the circumstances warrant it, that it proceedsto its alleged destination, and, if there is any prima facie reason to suspect that an offence has hecn committed, to ensure that the offence is duly investigated and punished. 6. Lord Halifax is, however, most anxious that every effort should he made, compatible with the proper performanc of their duties by His Majesty’s ships, to avoid an incident in any waters of the Persian Gulf, more especially in the present time of unsettled international relations and having regard to the importance of the oil supplies derived from Persian territory. 7. His Lordship therefore urges that the instructions issued to the commanding officers of His Majesty’s ships should make this point abundantly clear and that the general Admiralty instructions ehould be accompanied by further (possibly secret) instructions to the effect that His Majesty's Government are anxious to avoid an incident within six miles of the Persian coast even more than elsewhere on the high seas, and that although the same action must, if the necessity inevitably arises, be taken within those limits as in the rest of the Gulf, commanders of ships should, if possible, contrive to avoid situations arising in which their ships are likely to be upon the scene when a dhow is stopped by a Persian vessel within the six mile limit. The simplest way of avoiding such situations is not to enter the six mile limit, and it is presumably usually possible for His Majesty’s ships,■ 1 '■■ ll . ’ 1 ' i ii.i ■ ■ r,««—— u except in one or two places where the main sea routes may pass near Persian islands, not to do so at all except when going to or from Persian ports. 8.

M. Soheily, who hinted that he was acting under * instructor, was informed that these rumours were entirely devoid of any foundation. At the same time it was pointed out to him that His Majesty’s Government could not recognise any right on the part of the Persian Government to be consulted on matters concerning the future of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf and that the i formation that the rumours were baseless was given entirely unofficially.

' 2. The main point raised in Mr. Seymour's memorandum is whether or not force should in the last resort be employed by one of H. .. Ships to protect an Arab dhow against molestation by a Persian warship. They note that Mr. Seymour suggests that, although force might properly be used in Arab territorial waters, it should not at present be authorised in cases occurring on the high seas. 3. Their Lordships suggest that the necessity for the employment of force against a Persian warship in such an eventuality is very unlikely to arise. On the one occasion when a few years ago a British sloop came on the scene when a Persian warship was interfering with an Arab dhow, the Persian ship made off in great haste long before H.M. 3hip came up with the dhow. 4. My Lords nevertheless consider it to be important that H.M. Ship s should have clear authority to use force if necessary, on the high seas as well as in Arab territorial waters. They suggest, therefore, that the instructions should The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.ft.l.taice the form that, in the event of an Arab dhow being interfered vith in the presence of a British warship, the latter should cougaunicate with the lersian warship, warn her that she la coisaltting an Illegal act and, if nece&amp;aary, take the dhow in tow and take such other steps as are necessary to ensure that she is not further interfered with. They would point out that unless the instructions are in the sense suggested above, there la always the possibility, however remote, that a Persian war vessel might persist in her interference in the presence of and in spite of remonstrances by a British warship. If in such circumstances no attempt were maue to resist the illegal action of the Persian warship the effect upon our prestige amongst the Arabs would be likely to be serious. 5. An auultional reason for issuing instructions in the sense proposed above is that (in spite of recent verbal coimounications by individual Persian officials) it seems likely that it will shortly be necessary to joake a formal communication to the Persian Government in the sense proposed in paragraph 6 of kr. Seymour’s memorandum - namely, that orders have been given to H.i. Ships to prevent any t interference with Arab dhows on the high seas. In this connection, Their Lords concur with the views expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Political Hesident f s semi-official letter of the List Lay. Any divergence between the language used at Tehran and the instructions Issued to H.x. Ships would clearly be open to objection. 6 . Another suggestion contained in kr. Seymour's memorandum is that in waters claimed, by Persia as territorial, but not admitted as such by His Majesty's Government, the same course should be adopted as in Persian territorial waters proper - namely that there should be no interventionO'N by His Majesty's ships, but that blplomtitic protests should be aiade and claims advanced if the vessels have been arrested without reasonable cause. The reason he advances for making this suggestion is the desirability of avoiding risking a reference to an international tribunal on the qdeBtion of the limit of Persian territorial waters, 7, Their Lordships feel that arrangements on the lines proposed are unnecessarily complicated, and that the risk of an incident leading to recourse to an international tribunal on the question of the proper extent of territorial waters can be discounted. They therefore suggest that the same instructions should cover the whole of the high seas, up to the limit admitted by us as Persian territorial water. 6 , As regards possible interferences inside Arab territorial waters. Their Lordships would draw attention to the Muscat, riahrein and Koweit Proclamations made in 1898-1900 in connection with the anas traffic. Copies of these proclamations are appended for convenient reference. It will be seen that they all confer upon Persian vessels the right of search of Muscat!, Bahreini and Kowelti dhows within the ruler'a own territorial waters. The question of the cancellation of these proclamations has recently been under consideration - see in this connection semi-official correspondence commencing with Mr, Clauson's letter P.2. 2970 of the 11th May and foreign Office despatch Ho.L04 to Tehran. Their Lordships consider that it ia extremely unlikely that the Persian Government are aware of these provisions, and they feel that it is not necessary to take open steps to cancel them - which, as pointed out in the correspondence referred to above, might draw attention to the Persian Firman of 1897, They woula point out moreover that these proclamations only x'elate to the suppression of the arms trade, whereas the present activities of the foreign warships seem to be mainly directed to the suppression of smuggling.f f «M&gt;d*d •vsul jriJ Tt bj&amp;mwYJba emtelo Jut# &amp;jm ftf ^ai •sol. qm! o^^Atn a fT * 9 * 0*9 jwhMH •* ^riilf»i*i: vAf el nolle.«lxU lo tioiltiiii/t; *ai «c- jt- •&gt;! •&lt;»A &lt; 9 , xf1N^i to jiiiH sal 14K^# ijim 'ilese.#^aerKB ^arao^o^*, I a -- oa »ewc*®&lt;ri ol ^xM&amp;fetJ IrnKbl^l ftfi {'xelm 410 Jm^xj 'i&amp;qoiit to nollftoctt o4^ 0© s»*ii la« Q^a j w'ta'tw.j %mtt »6 tm&amp; ox qp- t MMi oaJ to i/Ionw 041 # tOvo» kXva&amp;a enalJwtjmaJt • loin - ,1:^4 r.riZ*tW *4 &lt;W, t v i *.:Jit.Jm 111 1 / &amp; ., . 1 *. . d-’H.-- *i U/U «t'ii&gt;hO| «.'. . b 05 rr.J Jr. ' &gt;•.. «M«| j^MW '.ieal ,.,9®#*v IsilO Jilwj «U^t *&gt;&lt; 4 B •i*.-iK^.

Ships should provide that il a Persian warship which is interfering with an Arab dhow attempts to justify her action to a British warship by alleging that the vessel is engaged in the arms traffic, the British Commanding Officer should reply that, if the allegation proves to be correct, he will see that the offenders are properly dealt with according to the law to which they are subject; and that he should subsequently take the necessary steps to ensure that this is done, acting in collaboration with the Political Resident and his staff* It is understood that all the Arab States in treaty relations with H.a. Government have legislation prohibiting their subjects from engaging in the arms traffic. 10. Their Lordships have noted that in the Political Resident’s note dated 26th February suggesting the cancellation of the proclamations, it is stated in paragraph 2 that under the Muscat Proclamation Persian vessels have rights of search of Muscat vessels on the high seas. Their Lordships presume that.this interpretation is based upon the notification, dated 13th January, 1898, which was apparently Issued at the same time as the proclamation and which states that 'in future our Muscat flag will be no protection to vessels carrying the said arms and ammunition from our dominions to India and Persia”. Their Lordships would suggest that it is unnecessary to treat this notification as formally conveying powers of search upon the high seas, and that it can be regarded as being no more than an intimation to the Sultan’s subjects that they cannot expect the support of their ruler if they indulge in forbidden activities. On the assumption, therefore, that no other document exists which confers these powers in a moreformal and definite manner. Their Lordships suggest that the matter would he adequately met if the instruction covering the case where a Persian warship alleges that a dhow is engaged in the arms traffic (see paragraph 9 above) were made applicable to any case of interference with an Arab dhow on the high seas as well as in Arab territorial waters, 11. In reply to the enquiry as to the existing that Their Lordships have been unable to trace that any specific instructions governing the use of force have been issued to H.M. Ships in connection with Persian interferences with Arab dhows, other than those issued in Admiralty letter M.01721/31 of the 14th October, 1931, (copies of which were sent to Foreign Office and iidia Office on the same date) which stated that 'any interference outside Persian territorial waters with Arab dhows suspected of smuggling would call for a strong protest. The action to be taken would, however, have to depend on the circumstances of the case.' As regards instruction of general application, Article 949 K.H. A A. I. provides that British ships (which would undoubtedly be interpreted as including ships under British protection) 'are only to be protected by force against actual and wrongful violence and when remonstrance has failed'*. This / Article relates to British ships in foreign ports, and a fortiori it could be argued that it applies with even greater force to British ships upon the high seas.

I have received your despatch No. 204_of the 3rd June and have the honour to submit the following observatf on it and the proposal in the note by the Honourable the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf enclosed in it to the effect that steps should be taken to cancel the Muscat proclamation of 1893, substituting for it an authority confined to Hie Majesty’s Ships to search Arab dhows, and that Bahreini and Koweiti proc lamations on this same subject of the right to search for arms should be similarly cancelled and redrafted. Fowle's note that he is not seriously concerned as regards possible Iranian action in Bahreini or Koweiti waters under the powers conferred by the two latter proclamations, but that he has serious misgivings that Iranian warships, by abusing these powers, and using those already conferred by the Muscat proclamation, will interfere with Arab dhows on the High Seas. At the date when Sir T. Fowle’s note was written, last February, there was much reason for such misgivings in view of repeated cases of high-handed action by Iranian warships in all kinds of waters in the Persian Gulf. 3# Since then, however, I have madf strong protests to the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs and have discussed with him and his officials the latent dangers. In May - see my T. telegram No . 65 o f the ; 2nd May, a member of my staff was in formed y the Ministry of Foreign Affaire that orders were being It would seem from paragraphs 2 and 3 of Sir T /issued The Right Honourable Anthony Kden, M.P., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign ffice, S.t.l.issued to Iranian ships not to interfere with Ar$b vessels in Arab territorial waters and on the 12th June f as reported in my telegram No* 75 of the 15th June, the Political Director - General of the Ministry informed me that instructions had been Iranian warships that given to^Arab vessels were not to be stopped on the High Seas* No fresh case of interference has since been reported. Further more, these conversations certainly confirmed in my mind what has for long time been our Impression, namely that the Iranian Government are not aware of the provisions of the Muscat Proc lamation of 1896. It may well be that they are unaware of the Bahrein and Koweit proclamations also. 4. It would be unduly optimistic to expect that the Iranian naval authorities will permanently abandon their illegal activities against Arab dhows, but at present the situa tion, and not least as regards the High Seas, seems reasonably satisfactory, and the practical reasons which existed last Feb ruary for cancelling the proclamations in question are at least in abeyance. This, together with the considerations set out in paragraph 2 of your despatch under reference, lead me to hope that for the present at any rate no action in regard to the proclamations will be taken* 5* I am sending copies of this despatch to the secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No* 130 and to the Honourable the Political Hesidtnt in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No, 60* I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

' a V *4 3 3 i. Iranien Government sliips hove r^aently bi»on interfering with Arab dhows whenever they find them* and dhows have been arrested in Persian waters* in the open sea and actually in Arab territorial waters* It is to be hoped that the representations which have been made in Tehran may have a satisfactory result* It is how ever proving difficult to extract any answer at all from the Iranian Government and we must contemplate the possibility that the Iranians will continue the illegal practices of which we oomxjlain* 3* This leads to the questionj What action* if any* is to be taken by His Majesty’s Ships in the Persian Gulf if they arrive on the scene while an Iranian vessel is committing one of these acts* For instance* what action should be taken if one of Ills Majesty’s .Ships finds an Iranian ship boarding a dhow in Arab waters or on the high seas ? 4. It seems necessary to distinguish four classes of cases dhows may be arrested - a) In waters admitted by all to be Iranian territorial waterss b) In waters claimed by Iran as territorial but not admitted as such by His Majesty's Government: o) On the high seas: d) tfithin the Three Mils Limit on the Arab coast, 6 * As regards (a) (arrests in Iranian territorial waters) no action by Hi© Majesty's dhips appears possible; diplomatic protests can be made and claims put forward if dhows have been arrested without reasonable cause, B* Waters claimed by Iran as territorial but not so admitted by His 1 ajesty's Government, In the case of arrests in this zone it would seem preferable to adopt the same course as that suggested for arrests in Iranian territorial waters* It would probably not be desired to risk a reference to an international tribunal on the question of the right of the Iranians to arrest dhows in the waters claimed by them as /territorial*- 2 - /“n y^v 5A 0 territorial. C. and D* Arrests on the high aeaa and in Arab Coastal waters. In these oases it seems most undesirable that His Majesty 1 a Ships, if one of thsa happen# to witness an arrest, should acquiesce. This applies more strongly in the case of an arrest in Arab waters: in fact it seems out of the question that we should permit the arrest of a dhow in Arab waters if one oi His Majeoty*© dhips is present. 6. If therefore the Iranian Government do not, within a reasonable time, return a satisfactory answer to the representa tions which have been made, it is suggested that they should oe warned that His Majesty’s Government cannot, in view of their treaties with the Arab rulers, acquiesce in the continued of Arab dhows arrests 4 'on the high seas and in Arab waters and that orders have been given to His Majesty’s dhips to prevent any such arrest* should one of them be present when the arrest is being made. 7. It is unlikely that an Iranian vessel would in fact board a dhow on the high seas or in Arab waters in the presence of one of His Majesty’s dhips: but there is the possibility that this might happen and it is necessary to consider whether, in such an event, force should in the last resort be useu to prevent an arrest. My own feeling is that force might properly be used, as a last resort, to prevent an arrest in Arab territorial waters, but that it should not at present be authorised in cases which may occur on the high seas. This is perhaps illogical i but we have to admit that n large proportion of these dhows are smugglers and it Is desirable to balance^, or indeed the necessity of resisting Iranian encroachments on Arab rights against the disadvantage of placing His Majesty’s Ships in the position of protector© of smuggling. I realise the dravibacks of differentiating between the action to be taken on the high seas and in Arab waters, and the question ox uoing force,if necessary,to prevent arrests on the high seas might have to be reconsidered later.[\ A R -; 1 193. 7 22nd May, 1937* no* 189 (436/3/37j 2 ir, with reference to ay telegram iio# 6 b of to-day*® date I have the honour to report that I apo&amp;e to Monsieur Adi to-day about the question of searching dhows* I said understood that the Iranian Government was prepared to gi? the Iranian Government would give me an aasursmce, in what wajr they thought bestgthat Arab vessels would not be interfer^ed with on the High seas* Adi said that we did not agreement the limit of territorial waters* I replied that this was so: but there was at any rate a zone which all recognised to be the High Seas: the Iranian Government ought to be ready to say they would not interfere with foreign ships on what all recognised as the high Seas* I Jcnew the attitude of the Iranian Government about our treaties with the Arab States, but this was really quite a distinct question* The Arab States did in point of fact exist, and their vessels were foreign, not Iranian vessels: no claim for Iranian ships to stop them on the high seas could be substantiated, and recent events off the coasts of Spain showed what difficulties might arise if attempts were made to enforce any such claim* 2 # Monsieur Adi did not make any attempt to Justify the action of the Iranian sloops and indeed confined himself mainly to expressing the hope that we could settle this question shortly* 3 # After leaving Monsieur Adi I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs and again impressed upon him the importance of stopping these incidents outside Iranian waters* He also made orders not to stop dhows in Arab waters* There was,howevc 5 the question of the High Seas, and what I hoped for was tt Honourable /no An uhony ilien, M* 0 • ! • P *, etc*, etc*, etc*, The Foreign Office*no claim that the action of the Iranian naval authorities could be justified* 4 * I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India No. 87 # the The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 45 and to the senior Naval office, Persian Gulf Division, No. 456/3/37, I hay© the honour to be with the highest respect.

This verbal statement seems satisfactory as lar as it croes but its value is somewhat discounted by the fact that the o Ministry assert that in two cases about which we recently complai (see my despatches Nos.101 of Mareh 14th and 122 of March 31so) the dhows were in Persian waters. 5.

COPY. fE 3146/2463/91) PEHSIAM ATTITUPE TOWARDS TEE ARAB STATES OP TEE PERSIAN GULP. In the course of an interview with me this morning, the Persian Minister alluded to a note which had appeared in the was about to pay a visit to this country as the guest of His Majesty 1 s Government. He said that he would much appreciate any information about this visit. He had heard it suggested tightening up of relations between Arab States. 2. I replied that the Sheikh of Bahrein was in fact coming for a short visit to this country as the guest of His Majesty^ Government, but that the visit had no special political object. On the other hand, as the Persian Government knew, Barhein, Koweit, Qatar, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, were States which had long been in special treaty relation with His Majesty 1 s Government and which were, from the international point of view, under British protection. Our position in regard to them was perfectly clear and perfectly definite. 3. I did not know what the Minister meant by the talk of Arab unity. These particular States were a special preserve of His Majesty 1 s Government, whose policy towards them rested on what might be described as a kind of Monroe Doctrine. it would have been difficult for them to stand alone; but they were under British protection and there was no question of His Majesty 1 s Government allowing them to fall under the control of any other 'Times' of May 29th, to the effect that the Sheikh of Bahrein that it might be connected with recent proposals for a Power./Power. 4. M. Ala said that, as I knew, his Government had special views on the question of Bahrein. I replied that I was well aware of this, hut that there was no possibility whatever of His Majesty’s Government changing their attitude. As he knew, I was all for regularising the position in regard to matters v/here circumstances had changed or where the juridical position might need clearing up. But this was not so in the case of Bahrein, where we were perfectly satisfied as to our position, and there was no question of our altering our attitude. The sooner the Persian Government realized this the better. 5. The Minister then reverted to the idea of Arab unity and began making tentative enquiries in regard to the Saudi-lraqi Treaty. I explained that it had always been a principle of our policy to further friendly relations between Powers with whom we were on friendly terms ourselves. We were on excellent terms both with Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and it was largely due to our efforts that these two States had made friends with each other some years ago. They were perfectly free to make a new treaty of friendship and we were glad to see close and friendly relations growing up between them. The treaty itself, as far as we could see, was a perfectly innocent one and called for no comment. It had nothing whatever to do with the States under our protection. 6. The Minister said that it had crossed his mind that it might have been intended as a kind of insurance against possible Italian aggression in Arabia. I said I could express no opinion on this, but that, while no-one could, of course, prophesy/prophesy as to what a country in the neurotic frame of mind of present-day Italy would do next, it seemed distinctly unlikely that she would attempt another adventure in Arabia. 7. I do not think M. Ala T s enquiries were meant to be impertinent and I saw no harm, therefore, in taking the opportunity of emphasising the facts of the situation as regards our position vis-d-vis the Arab States in the Persian p Gulf, and of dissipating his misconceptions about the implications of the Saudi-lraqi Treaty. I left him under no illusion as to our attitude towards Bahrein. (Sgd.) Gr.W.

When the incident was brought to their notice at that time the j Legation at Teheran at once addressed a note to the Persian Government, but, in spite of frequent reminders, no^reply has ever been received, apparently owing to the Persian Government’s refusal to reply in writing to any communcation about Arab affairs.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that in April last it was brought to the notice of Sir R. H. Hoare by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that a Muscat! vessel had been seized at Charbar and that the captain and crew had been imprisoned. The men had subsequently been released, but the dhow was [ still under detention. 2. On receipt of this report Sir R. H. Hoare addressed an enquiry to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In spite of frequent reminders, no written reply has ever been received to this note, but in September one of the munshis was informed orally by Ali Khan Motamedi that an enquiry by the courts had proved the crew innocent (presumably of smuggling). No steps had, however, been taken by the captain or any other interested party to deal with the vessel or its cargo. A few days ago, however, the same official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed the oriental secretary that the dhow had sunk at its moorings. When asked to send a written reply to the notes from His Majesty’s Legation he stated that he was unable to give one. 3. The Political Agent at Muscat has so far not been able to furnish any further details as to the reason for the detention of the dhow and crew. I am, however, requesting Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle to remind him that his report is awaited. On receipt of it I shall address the Persian Government again. 4. This case provides yet another example of the Persian Government’s (/ refusal to reply in writing to notes about Arab affairs. Muscat is not claimed by the Persian Government, but, even so, they dare not send a written answer. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and a copy to the honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf under cover of my despatch No. 204.

From the information now furnished by the Sheikh of Koweit, it appears that there have been no recent cases of the tearing up of certificates of identity, but that Koweit subjects continue to be fined by the Persian authorities and issued with Ilm-o-khabars or Persian travel documents, theircertificates of identity being simply ignored. The Legation at Tehran have asked the Residency to instruct the Political Agent at Koweit to keep a record of any cases in which Koweit subjects have their certificates of identity torn up or are fined by Persian officials. It will be remembered that in view of the Persian refusal to recognise British passports bearing visas $ot endorsements for Koweit (or Bahrein) it was recently decided to issue British subjects travelling to Koweit or urtha. .

(No. 391.) Sir, Gnlhek, August 23, 1934. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch No. 381 of the 1st August on the subject of a draft reply to the letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs which I had submitted for your consideration. 2. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs is just leaving for Geneva, I think that there is little advantage in sending him any reply at all; a reply on the quite secondary point of the refusal of the Persian Government to visa pass ports containing a mention of Koweit and Bahrein would, if it had any result at all, probably focus his attention on the more important issues which I had not taken up. 3. With regard to Koweit, I share your view that there is nothing to be gained by an “ attempt to drag the Persian Government into the open ” further than the Minister for Foreign Affairs has come. I use the word “ further ” advisedly, because if the Minister for Foreign Affairs himself is “ not aware as Kazemi says ‘ of the views of the Imperial Government,” the only sane conclusion is that there is no claim to sovereignty over Koweit. 4. At the same time, I feel that I should invite your attention to the section in the “ Administrative Report of the Persian Gulf for the year 1933 ” which discusses Koweit’s relations with Persia. It will be seen on page 67 that “ a Koweit subject going direct to Mohammerah, Bushire or Bander Abbas has his Koweit certificate of identity torn up by the local Persian authorities and is fined, on the excuse that he should have taken out a Persian passport, Koweit being a province of Persia in the minds of the local officials, whatever the Persian Government may say officially to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran.” 5. I am enquiring whether or not this is a new development. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 181), and to the Acting Political Resident in the Persia Gulf at Bushire (No. 149). I have, &amp;c. R. H.

I have now received Sir John Slaon* s instructions to reply as follows to the assertion of the Imperial Government that they cannot take cognisance of the treaties between Great Britain and the Arab States in question The only practical effect of persistence in such an attitude by the Imperial Government will be that it will render impossible any form of communication from the Imperial Government to the Arab Rulers who have entrusted the conduct of their foreign relations to His Majesty's Government.

It is preferable, moreover at the present juncture, to avoid any reference to the situation which would arise in the event of the Persian Government falling to afford proper satisfaction to representations made by you on behalf of the Arab rulera.

Hoare was authorised to communicate officially the major treaties ana agreements between H.L.G. ana Koweit, Bahrein, ^atar and muscat to the Persian Government in the spring of this year. The text of his letter to the Persian Minister for Poreign Affairs will he founu on P.Z.3119/34 flagged. From his despatch of 4th lay on P.Z.4503/34 it will he seen that the communication of these treaties has caused some little embarrassment to the Persian Government and the Minister in his despatch has suggested a draft reply to their latest Note. 2. The Foreign Office, in the light of the recent discussions in the Ivan isterial middle Fast Committee think the minister's draft (which in substance would certainly be satisfactory from our point of view) is too strongly expressed, ana to tnis we may defer. On the other, hand, the statement in the instructions which, the Foreign Office propose to send to the Minister that 'it is the present wish of H.M.G. that no action of a challenging nature should be taken vis-a-vis of the Persian Government'’ goes too far in the opposite direction, ana does not, it is suggested, correctly represent the attitude of H.M.G. The recent decision of the laddie East Committee was (as the Foreign Office correctly state in their telegram of 4th July, No.65, to Tehran, on P.Z.4463/34 flagged) that •for the present at any rate our objective should be to maintain the existing position generally and especially the status quo in the Gulf' and that 'owing uo the delicacy of the position at Henjam ana Basiduit will therefore he necessary to refrain from any action vis-a-vis of the Persian Government likely to provoke them to demand, our withdrawal from either place 1 *. But in reaching this conclusion the Committee, I think, had in view the undesirability of any positive provocative action of a general kind calculated to bring about a breach of relations which might result in a request to us to evacuate Hen jam ana-or Basidu, or any specific action in connection with Henjam ana Basidu likely to prouuce tne same result. 1 ao not tnink that they intenuea that we should abstain from expressing ourselves in reasonably firm terms to Persia on other points when circumstances seemed to make this desirable. In view of the general importance of this point it seems well to refer to it in some aetail in our reply, so far as the present draft instructions go the small crafting alteration suggested in the letter now put up will meet the point. 3. We may agree with the Foreign Office that it is unnecessary in now replying to the Persian Government to enter into the question of what we should do if we fail to get satisfaction for our legitimate representations on behalf of the Arab rulers. A separate submission will be made shewing the present position in regard to the various chow incidents whidf: have been the subject of representations to the Persian Government. The Persian replies have been unsatisfactory , but on the whole it is doubtful whether any of the outstanding cases (with one possible exception) is sufficiently serious to justify our facing serious difficulty with Persia and in these circumstances we may perhaps let the draft stand. If there are further incidents at a later stage/lit Minute Paper. Department. r-\ &gt; stage and we are not able to obtain satisfaction from Persia in respect of them, we shall have to consider other measures to protect the interests of the Arab rulers. • • t 4. we may also agree tnat it is undesirable, by pursuing the precise meaning of the rather vague reference in Kazemi*s letter to 'lands and places such as Bahrein, etc. which are inseparable parts of Persian territory', to provoke a controversy about the status of Koweit or sheikhdoms or territories, other than Bahrein, on the Arab littoral. We might very well stir up a hornet's next without any corresponding advantage to ourselves. 5. Prom the Canister’s despatch of 16th June, No.299, it will.be seen that the Persian Foreign Cffice have now intimated that it has'been decided on principle that notes regarding Questions concerning the arao sheikhdoms should not be replied to in writing'. ^e can wait and see wnat tne practical effect of this is. It is unnecessary and undesirable at the moment to start a controversy regarding it. We have maae our position in regard to these sheikhdoms quite clear, not only by the various notes which we have despatched in the past, but by the official conmunication of our treaties, and we can leave natters at that point for one present, so long as Persia pays attention to the representations contained in our Notes it does not perhaps much matter whether we receive written replies oo those Notes or not. But if she neither meets our Complaints nor replies to our Notes then a different situation will arise which will call for different handling. 2621 6000 3/34 y, JLoJ&amp;ljowC 1 ■ 1/1P ' 7- I agree generally. It seems desirable to take this opportunity, as the draft letter to the F.O. does, of general dissent from the far too extensive interpretation which the F.O. apparently seek to put on the ' status g uo M decision of the Middle East Committee. As regards Tehran despatch 299 of 16th June (P.Z. 4599/34), and para. 5 of Mr. Laithwaite's minute, we could hardly acquiesce indefinitely in Persia's attitude if she refuses to reply to notes which we have addressed to her in the interests of the Arab Rulers, e.g., in the dhow cases. The position in regard to these cases is being re-examined. If any case seems to call for a reminder, we ought to use firm language to the Persian Govt., e.g., in the sense of that which was suggested at A of Sir R.

The view of the Ministerial committee, as Sir Samuel Hoare understood it, was ih the first place that particular care should he taken in any communication with the Persian Govt, or in any action, in regard to Henjam and Basidu, to avoid anything which might lead that Govt, to throw down a challenge to H.M.G. in regard to their continued occupition of those places. Secondly that, so far as practicable, any communication of a general character to the Persian Govt, of a nature so provocative as to give that Govt, a justification for breaking off relations or requesting the immediate evacuation of Basidu and Henjam should be avoided. It was not, however, their intention that H.M.G., when circumstances appeared to make this desirable, should abstain from expressing themselves in firm terms to the Persian Govt, or from adopting a firm attitude towards them^-en- KteitteFs-falliRg-euteiae-theee-1imitsr eusk-ks-the-present- He-would proper in these circumstances, —af—to a Sir John Simon * eencurren-ee, fflatpify paragraph 2 of the draft instructions/Department.

I am to request that Sir John Simon may be informed at an early date whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the terms of the draft. 3. The question of a possible Persian claim to Koweit, referred to in the final paragraph of the draft, is more fully dealt with in Foreign Office letter No. E 3680/139 /34 of to-day’s date. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.- THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. May 24, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 3357/2240/91] No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 24.) (No. 232.) Sir, Tehran, May 4, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 131 of the 17th March last enclosing a copy of a letter which I addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicating to him copies of certain treaties and agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India and certain Arab rulers, I have the honour to transmit to you the accompanying translation of a reply from Mirza Bagher Khan Kazemi. 2. This letter is couched in such oracular language that it is not easy to discover its exact meaning. Kazemi quotes from his note referred to in Mr. Mallet’s despatch No. 506 of the 31st October last, a note in which he appeared to have admitted that there had at least been private conversations now appears to deny that either he or any of his staff ever suggested that the Persian Government were not already in full possession of all information regarding those rulers. Mr. Mallet recollects most clearly that on various occasions last summer Anushirvan Khan Sepahbodi and Shayesteh, after emphasising the private nature of their enquiries, asked him about the agreements governing our relations with the Arab rulers. It was, indeed, as a result of these enquiries that Mr. Mallet addressed to you his telegram No. 246 of the 30th September last. Mr. Mallet’s recollection of his conversation with Kazemi on the 15th October on the same subject is set forth in his despatch No. 506 of the 31st October last. 3. Whether or not, either privately or officially, the Persian Government made such enquiries is, however, of no great importance compared with the fact that in my letter of the 17th March I gave Kazemi documents which evidently have caused him some embarrassment. The mere sight of them has apparently been sufficient to compel him to remind me of a series of notes in which the Persian Government have insolently asserted that they cannot admit any sort of intervention on the part of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Arab rulers on the opposite shore of the Persian Gulf. From this, Kazemi goes on to reassert, not only the Persian claim to Bahrein, but apparently to other places vaguely referred to as ‘ c etcetera. 4. Kazemi’s letter appears to me to need a sharp retort and, if you approve, I propose to reply in the following sense :— “ The Persian Government assert that they cannot take cognisance of our treaties and agreements with the Arab rulers. The only effect of persistence in this attitude will, in fact, be that it will be impossible for the Persian Government to make any form of communication to these rulers who have entrusted their foreign relations to His Majesty’s Government. Such a self-denying ordinance is clearly a matter of no concern either to us or to the rulers. On the other hand, we are by treaty bound to represent to the Persian or any other foreign Government that may be concerned any matter which the ruler of one of the Arab principalities in exclusive treaty relations with us may request us to raise with that Government. The mere fact that the Persian Government does not recognise our right to do so cannot in any way affect our duty towards the Arab ruler concerned, and we should be failing in our treaty obligations to the ruler concerned if we did not bring to the attention of the Persian Government any matter such as those regarding which we have had, in the course of the past year, to make representations. We are equally bound to insist on proper satisfaction being given and a refusal to grant satisfaction must raise serious issues. on the subject of our relations with the Arab rulers, but at the same time he [115 aa—1|2 “ As regards the question of Bahrein, his Excellency must surely be fully aware of our views as to this entirely preposterous claim. Moreover, the phrase ‘ lands and places such as Bahrein, etcetera, which are inseparable parts of Persian territory ' appears to indicate some wider pretensions of which His Majesty’s Government have not hitherto been apprised. His Excellency may wish to make his meaning clearer on this point.” 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 93). (Translation.) Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Department of Europe and America) to His Majesty's Minister y dated Ordibehesht 10, 1313 (April 30, 1934). My dear Minister, YOUR Excellency’s esteemed note of the 26th Esfand, 1312 (the 17th March, 1934), together with its enclosures, has been duly received. With regard to the statement made in your note to the effect that the members of the staff of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and myself have informed Mr. Mallet that information and confidence [sic] regarding the exact nature of the relations between the British Government and the sheikhs of the southern coast of the Persian Gulf was lacking, I have to state that this has caused much surprise to me, since such a statement has never been made to Mr. Mallet either by myself or by the staff of this Ministry, but, on the contrary, in the course of an interview which I had with him on the 24th Mehr, 1312 (the 16th October, 1933), when he was acting as Charge d’Affaires, I explained and pointed out to him most clearly and categorically the definite viewpoint of the Imperial Government in the matter. Moreover, during the last few years the definite views of the Imperial Government have been clearly expressed in numerous official notes, e.g., in note No. 11024 of the 30th Murdad, 1307 (the 21st August, 1928), in note No. 13018 of the 29th Shahrivar, 1307 (the 20th September, 1928), and in note No. 18103 of the 29th Mehr, 1312 (the 21st October, 1933). I now once more emphasise [sic] that your Excellency will, no doubt, admit that the Persian Government, in respect of conventions and agreements with which they have not been concerned or to which they have not been a party, either individually or as a party to a multilateral instrument, have no obligation whatever to recognise such treaties and agreements as official or to consider them valid so far as they concern this Government or to give effect to them. The agreements to which your Excellency alludes are of such a nature. Therefore, there exists no obligation on the Persian Government in respect of these agree ments, and if any agreements, concessions and obligations are laid down in these treaties and agreements which may be contrary to the interests and rights of Persia or may have a prejudicial effect on these rights and interests, my Government do not consider or accept them as being of practical value as evidence from a legal point of view [sfc] against Persia. Furthermore, not only does the Persian Government consider those of the agreements, treaties and concessions in question which relate to lands and places such as Bahrein, etcetera, which are inseparable parts of Persian territory, to be neither official nor valid, but it considers the conclusion of such instruments by a third Power to be contrary to the principle of frien4ship, and protests strongly and vigorously against such a step which violates the rights of sovereignty and suzerainty of Persia in her own territory and waters. I have, &amp;c. r! h. hoare. Enclosure in No. 1.

HIS Maiesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of his letter to the Persian Minister for Foreign Aftairs, dated the 17th March, on the subject of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Arab principalities. Tehran, March 17, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. My dear Minister, March 17, YOUR Excellency may remember that on more than one occasion during the past vear you yourself, or members of the department over which you now preside, have expressed to Mr. Mallet some uncertainty as to the precise natuie of the relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and certain Arab principalities situated on the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. 2. In order to dispel this uncertainty, I have been authorised to draw the attention of your Excellency to the following treaties and agreements, of which the texts are enclosed :— (1) An agreement dated the 23rd January, 1899, with the Sheikh of Koweit. (2) An agreement dated the 13th March, 1892, with the Sheikh of Bahrein. (3) A treaty dated the 3rd November, 1916, with the Sheikh of Qatar. (4) A treaty dated the 19th March, 1891, with the Sultan of Muscat. (5) An agreement dated the 20th March, 1891, with the Sultan of Muscat. 3. The texts of the agreements with the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi (dated the 6th March, 1892), Debai, Ajman and Sharjah (dated the 7th March, 1892), and Ras-ul-Khaimah and Umm-ul-Qawain (dated the 8th March, 1892), were com municated to your Excellency’s predecessor in Mr. Parr’s note No. 228 of the 7th September, 1928. 4. In addition, there are other less important treaties and agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India and the rulers mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs. 5. In general terms the position is that all these rulers have placed the conduct of their foreign relations in the hands of His Majesty s Government. 6. I should be happy to think that, at any rate in the cases of Koweit, Muscat and Qatar, it was owing to lack of information to which I have alluded in my opening paragraph that certain notes and semi-official communications received from your Excellency in recent months (notably of the 29th Mehr, 1312 (21st October/l933)) have contained expressions indicating a refusal to admit the rmht of His Majesty’s Legation to make representations to the Persian Government on behalf of the Arab principalities. But if, as the reference in your Excellency’s note No. 18103 to the correspondence between his Excellency Mirza Fathullah Khan Pakrevan and Mr. Parr in 1928 suggests, such a hope would be illusory, I shall be happy to explain to your Excellency the views of my G ° Vernment - R.

Sir, 19 3 4 I have the honour to transmit, herewith ^7 7&gt;f? ^3 a translation of the Note from the Persian Government whieh formed the suhjeet of my telegram No. 15 of January 18th. (see Mr. Mallat f s despatch No. 475 of October 13th) was twofold: ( 1 ) that a dhow was hoarded on the high seas from the Persian sloop 'Babr’* without having been called upon to show its flag, ( 2 ) that it was searched in spite of its papers showing that it was Trucial Omani. 3. The Persian Government admit that the dhow was boarded as stated by Mr. Mallet and that an 'inspection did take place, lasting however only five minutes and not half an hour as Mr. Mallet had stated. 4. The Minister for Foreign Affairs justifies, by implication, the action taken, the justification consisting in the faet that the ship proved not to belong M to such countries as have a definite international status' However, this is all very tentative and the Minister for Foreign Affairs is far from categorical. At the same time I am a little afraid that he is engaged in building up a facade of truculence about the Arab Sheikhs collectively. It is of some importance to stop this before we engage on /the The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc. The Foreign Officethe treaty negotiations, otherwise there is a Hanger lest the Persian Govern aent come to attach undue importance to the concession involved in their eventual recognition. I think it is time to tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs that their international status is not affected hy the fact that Persian recognition is withheld and that their treaties « with us are fully valid. I shall also offer to communicate to him, as authorised hy your telegram No. 215, copies of these treaties if he shares the curiosity evinced on this subject by Anushlrvan Khan Sepahbodl in the summer, leaving it to him to deprecate this course when he the realises that'Bahrein treaty is included. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 29), and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf (No. 24). I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) Ro H. HoareTranslation: m From the Peraian Minister for Foreign Affair* (Department of Veetem Surope and America) addressed to His Majesty’s Minister* No. 87140 dated 23rd Day 1312 (13th January 1934). Monsieur le Ministre, I hare the honour to inform Your xeellency that the substance of the note of the 21 *t lehr 1312 (13th October) of Mr. Mallet, the Ch&amp;rgi d'Affaires of tne honouratie Legation, in regard to the steps ta&amp;en by the ’Babr’ in inspecting a dhow belonging to the B&amp;hr-ul-Banat coasts, was communicated in due time to the proper authorities. 8# There are discrepancies with regard to the circumstances of the case, between the statements made by the Imperial Naval authorities and the report which has been received by His Majesty's Legation, such as the duration of the inspection which did not exceed five minutes; and it is possible that the mention of half an hour referred to the length of time required for lowering the boat from the 'Babr*. 3* But the more Important subject la the matter of principle which arises in this connection and which I think should be discussed and examined further at a convenient occasion. The opinion expressed by Mr- Mallet in his note was that the 'Babr* on sighting a dhow without a flag should, if it was suspicious of the dhow, have asked it to show its flag. 4. It seems to me that this may be considered practicable in case of ships belonging to such countries as have a definite international status and whieh are recognised. &amp;• With regard to the interference of His Majeetyfe Legation in questions relating to the Sheikha of the uauth of the Persian (HiIf, Your excellency is already aware of the views of the Imperial Government and there is no need to repeat them.

The Foreign Office indicate demi-officially that if we see no objection they would like to authorise Sir R. Hoare to deal with the matter on the lines which he suggests and enquire whether this would meet with our concurrence. 2. The actual incident is not perhaps of much importance, though the cumulative effect of a number ( of cases of interference with the vessels of our Arab protegees and of failure on our part to secure any satisfaction for them can do no good to our prestige. The more important point is the question of principle raised by the repaatea Persian refusal, frequently repeated in the last few months, to recognise our special treaty relations with tne rulers of the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf and their repudiation of our right to speak on behalf of those rulers. The history of this question up to date is given in tne memorandum attached. As will be seen, no reply has yet been sent to any of the Persian notes received by us in the last four months which make the assertion in question, nor was any reply sent in 1928 to a Persian note of the same character. Sir R. Hoare does not himself propose to send any written reply, at any rate at this stage, and would prefer to take the line orally with the Persian Government “that while our right to speak on behalf of the ^.rab rulers is indisputable in international law it is not in 21 It 1 5000 8.83 practice/practice of great importance to H.M.G. whether the Persian Government recognise the existence of our relations with these rulers or not so long as they refrain from interfering with the interests of those rulers in practice. If the Persian Government do so and subsequently refuse to receive representations or to give redress H.L.G. will he obliged to protect the interests of tne rulers in other ways. As a matter of form it may be desirable to communicate the ^ texts of the Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit Treaties in order to complete the picture begun by the communication in 1928 of the Trucial Coast treaties. The communication of the Bahrein Treaty would of course provoke a separate and special outburst.” 3. Were we at a different stage, the obvious course would be to send in a written note informing ; \the Persian Government that we did not regard their reply on the points of fact raised by our protests on behalf of our Arab protegees as satisfactory, and add that we were entirely unable to accept their suggestion that we were not authorised to speak on behalf of the Arab rulers of the Gulf^ On the other hand, the present moment is a delicate one.

They further referred back to the Persian assertion oi 19^8, referred to in the preceding paragraph. 3 . The Charge d’Affaires (telegram of 23rd October 1933, No.279, on P.Z.6860/33) recommended that Sir R.

All Arab Shaikhs have been duly warned. SD/ T.C. Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Attested: for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian GulfTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT THE last two paragraphs of the note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the search of an Arab dhow near Hen jam by a Persian warship, of which I sent you a translation in my despatch No. 497 of the 27th October, denied the right of His Majesty’s Government to make official representations to the Persian Government on behalf of the x\rab rulers of the Persian Gulf. For convenience, I quote the two paragraphs in question While giving the afore-mentioned facts I find myself compelled to draw your attention to the negotiations I have had with you on Sunday last, 24th Mehr (16th October) relating to the fact that the correspondence and negotiations made between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Legation in respect of matters relating to the sheikhs residing in the Persian Gulf are entirely of a private nature and it should not, therefore, be supposed that the Persian naval authorities in the Gulf have committed any irregular act or have made any injustice or oppression to anybody. Otherwise, the views of the Imperial Government in the matter are the same which have been set forth in the note of 29th Shahrivar, 1307 (20th September, 1928), of his Excellency Pakrevan to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation. ‘ ‘ In the circumstances, it is, therefore, natural that the Imperial Government cannot admit any sort of official intervention of His Britannic Majesty’s Government in the matters relating to the sheikhs inhabiting the Persian Gulf.’’ 2. I do not remember that the Minister for Foreign Affairs said anything during our conversation on the 15th October which could be construed as an intimation that the Persian Government regarded all communications about the affairs of Arab rulers that had hitherto passed between the Ministry and the Legation as having had an unofficial character. His Excellency merely enquired, as several of his staff had already done, what were the exact relations between His Majesty’s Government and these rulers and I was obliged, as before, to avoid going into details in my answer, confining myself to a statement that our right to represent those rulers was based upon our treaties with them. I suspect that this account of the conversation was invented when the extent of the Imperial anger at the arrest of the mudir became known. In any case it seems to matter little whether the conversations are to be considered official or private. 3. I quote here for convenience the more relevant part of Pakrevan’s note of the 20th September, 1928 :— “ With regard to the undertakings of the Sheikh of Abu-Dhabi, a copy of which you had sent me, with the names of other sheikhs from whom you have stated similar undertakings are possessed, I consider it necessary to point out to you that any agreement which may be against the rights or interests of Persia, or may limit those rights and interests, cannot be recognised as valid and cannot be used as a reason, from a legal point of view, for measures against the Imperial Government of Persia.” 4. This note, to which no reply was ever sent, had begun by stating that the Persian Government adhered to its views expressed in an earlier note of the 21st August, 1928, of which the relevant part reads as follows :— The statement made in your note under reply to the effect that the action taken by Persian officials in capturing a boat belonging to a foreign subject and that within the territorial waters of an independent sheikh has PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. November 21, 1933. Section 9. [E 7115/5828/91] No. 1. (No. 506.) Sir, Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 21.) Tehran, October 31, 1933. [971 x—9]'2 been accounted an act of ultra vires and is contrary to international law and usage has caused me great astonishment. You are aware that the Islands of Tamb and Abu Moussa are inseparable parts of Persian territory and that the Persian Government does not in any way recognise the sheikh alluded to in your above-mentioned note, as independent and the owner of the sa ^\ —— islands. Therefore, how can it be imagined that the action taken by Persian officials on the coasts and waters of Persia in regard to those who have carried smuggled goods is an act of ultra vires or is a breach of international law and usage and that it should form an object of protest on the part of the British Government. “In consequence, my Government cannot in any way approve of the attitude that the British Government has adopted on the pretext of having treaties with the above-mentioned Arab sheikhs and cannot accept the resulting declaration which they make of protecting them. On the contrary, this attitude of the British Government is contrary to the sincere and friendly relations which exist between the two Governments and my Government strongly protest against it.” 5. Though the phraseology of Seyyid Bagher Khan Kazemi in his present note is somewhat obscure, I doubt whether his Excellency is really going further than did Pakrevan in 1928. I think the Persian Government mean that they do not recognise the Arab rulers as independent owdng to our exclusive treaty rights with them, but at the same time will not admit our right to have such exclusive treaties. 6. It is possible that you may have already decided upon the proper answer to this absurd statement before my present despatch can be considered. In general, I am of opinion that the only line to take with the Persian Government is that while our right to speak on behalf of the Arab rulers is indisputable in international law, it is not in practice of great importance to His Majesty’s Government whether the Persian Government recognise the existence of our relations with those rulers or not, so long as they refrain from interfering with the interests of those rulers in practice. If the' Persian Government do so and' subsequently refuse to receive representations or to give redress, His Majesty’s Government will be obliged to protect the interests of the rulers in other ways. 7. As a matter of form it may be desirable to communicate the texts of the Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit treaties, in order to complete the picture begun by the communication in 1928 of the Trucial Coast Treaties. The communication of the Bahrein Treaty would, of course, provoke a separate and special outburst. 8. I venture to repeat the opinion expressed in my telegram No. 279 of the 23rd October that it is most unlikely that the Persian Government would have reopened this question at this juncture, except as the result of extreme irritation at the arrest of the Mudir of Customs at Basidu. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire &lt;iN’o. 188). r* I have. &amp;e. V. A. L. MALLET.7 :: INQ LETTER DATED 3 9 DtC 1933 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNT^rMAJEST^S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7107/1524/91] No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received Novemher 21.) (No. 497.) ; Sir, J 1 pfiTriri ()rtnhpr 27 WITH reference to my telegram No. 276 of the 22nd’ October, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a note that I have received from the Minister for foreign Affairs on the subject of the search and detention of the Koweiti dhow Fath-ul-Khair, near Henjam, on the 10th April. 2. I cannot discover any discrepancies in the accounts of this incident given to the Ministry for foreign Affairs, except that the sum of 300 rupees given a? the amount of the damages in my first note (see my despatch No. 232 of the 19th May) was increased to 400 rupees in my second note (see my despatch No. 382 of the 29th July), an increase which can easily be explained on the ground that the later information revealed more extensive damages. The sum of 400 rupees was stated in my second note to be due in respect of the first collision; no sum was mentioned in respect of the second collision. 3. The use of the term “near Henjam ” conveniently ignores the fact that the dhow was 4 miles from the'coast when first hailed by the Bahr. This is of course within the limits claimed by the Persian Government as territorial waters, but they do not base any part of their case upon this fact. 4. The point about the absence of a flag and ship’s papers is perhaps worth attention. It seems to me that our position would be strengthened'in these cases if all dhows were made to fly the flag of the ruler of the port to which they belong and to carry a certificate proving their nationality. o. I suggest that I should reply to this note that His Majesty’s Government do not admit the right of Persian vessels to search British or British-protected dhows on the high seas, and deal with the question of the discrepancies on the lines that I have indicated. I should add that the Persian note contains nothing to refute the charges of bad seamanship and inhumanity brought against the commander of the Bahr, although it is possible that he may have tried to make amends for his earlier conduct by treating the captain and crew kindly when once they were at Bander Abbas. The reply would have to add that the question of representations on behalf of Arab rulers had been, or would be. treated separately. 6. I shall deal in a separate despatch with the last two paragraphs of the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ note. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 180). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires. (Translation.) M. le Charge d’Affaires, YOUR esteemed note of the 7th Murdad (29th July, 1933), addressed to his Highness Feroughi, concerning the explanation of the complaint of the captain of the Fath-ul-Khair, was duly received. 2. As you will ha\e seen, certain points of contradiction and discrepancies are to lie observed in the statements and complaints made by the captain of the dhow, such as that in one place he ascribes the losses incurred to the first collision of the ship with the Babr. and in another place to the second collision which [971 x—10]occurred after the breaking of the rope. Similarly, he has on one occasion placed the amount of the losses at 300 rupees, and on another occasion at 400 rupees. In addition, although he admits that the ship Babr had ordered him to stop near Hen jam, yet he complains of the actions of the said ship on the high seas. 3. Nevertheless, the matter was referred to the quarters concerned and enquiries were made as to the facts of the case. The telegram received from the south has conlirmed the facts which have been brought to your notice in the note of the 14th Tir (5th July, 1933), and in especial the Imperial navy has declared plainly that no sort of damage has been caused to the dhow, and even that when the captain of the dhow was being released he expressed his utmost satisfaction at the kindness shown to himself and to his men. 4. In short, the dhow Fath-ul-Khair, when near Henjam, was suspected by the ship Babr of transporting smuggled goods, and as on account of bad weather the inspection of the cargo and the examination of the documents of the ship was made impossible at that place, the dhow was, in the company and under the guidance of some sailors of the Babr, piloted to Bandar Abbas, where the local customs examined its cargo. 5. From the telegram received 1 gather that the dhow Fath-ul-Khair was not in possession of ships’ papers, and had no British flag, although one cannot accept the waybills and flags of such dhows at their face value. 6. As regards the damages incurred, as the matter has been totally denied by the Imperial navy, I presume that the captain of the dhow meant the damages incurred as a result of the breaking of the mast following the storm at sea prior to his meeting with the ship Babr. 7. While furnishing the afore-mentioned facts I find myself compelled to draw your attention to the discussion I had ,with you on Sunday last, the 24th Mehr (the 15th October, 1933), relating to the fact that the correspondence and discussions of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government with His Britannic Majesty’s Legation in respect of matters relating to the sheikhs inhabiting the Persian Gulf have had a purely private character and it should not, therefore, be supposed that the Persian naval authorities in the Gulf have committed any irregular act or permitted injustice or oppression (to be caused) to any person. Otherwise, the views of the Imperial Government are the same as those set forth in the note of the 29th Shahrivar, 1307 (30th September, 1928), from his Excellency Pakrevan to His Britannic Majesty’s legation. 8. In the circumstances it is, therefore, natural that the Imperial Govern ment cannot admit any sort of official intervention on the part of His Britannic Majesty’s Government in matters relating to the sheikhs inhabiting the Persian Gulf.

Pakrevan. (Copy of English text.) M. le Gerant, Gulhek, August 4, 1928. I REGRET to have to draw your Excellency’s attention to a most serious incident which has been brought about by the action of a Persian Customs motor boat at the Island of Tunb situated in the Persian Gulf to the south of Kishm. 2. It appears that for some time past the Persian boat has been operating from Tunb, and now, at the end of July, it has seized a sailing boat belonging to the port of Debai and taken the boat, together with its fifteen women and children passengers, to Lingah. 3. I am informed that the passengers have been deprived of all their belongings, money, jewels and even clothes, and both they and the boat have been detained at Lingah. The boat carried no cargo. 4. The Island of Tunb belongs to the Arab Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimeh, who is allied to the family of the Sheikh of Shargah. In capturing a sailing boat belonging to a foreign subject within the territorial waters of an independent Arab sheikh is an act of ultra vires on the part of the Persian authorities concerned, and is, moreover, contrary to international law and usage. In view of the treaties which exist between these Arab sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government, I have, on the instructions of my Government, to register a serious protest against this arbitrary act. 5. 'I have therefore the honour to request that the Imperial Government will at once issue instructions to the competent department to release the boat and its passengers immediately and to restore to the latter all the belongings of which they have been deprived. I am further to add that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves full liberty to present to the Imperial Government a claim for compensation on behalf of the people who have been treated in this manner.

Translation of a Note from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty s Charge &lt;TAffaires, No. 11024, dated Amerdad 30£/t, 1307 [August 21s£, 1928). M. le Charge d’Affaires, YOUR note No. 204 of Amerdad 13th (August 4), stating that the Persian Customs boat has held up a sailing boat belonging to the port of Debai and has taken the said boat, together with its passengers, to Bandar Lingah and confiscat *all their belongings, was duly received. As the Ministry of Finance writes, the boat in question was carrying smuggled sugar, and that, after the boat was taken to Lingah, the smuggled sugar was confiscated according to the laws in force, the passengers were released and their effects returned to them. The statement made in your note under reply to the effect that the action taken by Persian officials in capturing a boat belonging to a foreign subject, and that within the territorial waters of an independent sheikh, has been accounted an act of ultra vires and is contrary to international law and usage has caused me great astonishment. You are aware that the Islands of Tunb and Abu Musa are inseparable parts of Persian territory and that the Persian Government does not in any way recognise the sheikh alluded to in your above-mentioned note as independent and the owner of the said islands. Therefore, how can it be imagined that the action taken by Persian officials on the coasts and waters of Persia in regard to those who have carried smuggled goods is an act of ultra vires or is a breach of international law and usage and that it should form an object of protest on the part of the British Government. In consequence, my Government cannot in any way approve of the attitude that the British Government has adopted on the pretext of having treaties with the above- mentioned Arab sheikhs and cannot accept the resulting declaration which they make of protecting them. On the contrary, this attitude of the British Government is contrary to the sincere and friendly relations which exist between the two Govern ments and my Government strongly protests against it. I avail, &amp;c. PAKREVAN. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. Parr to M. Pakrevan. M. le Gerant, Gulhek, September 7, 1928. YOUR note No. 11024 of the 21st August in regard to the seizure of a sailing boat belonging to the port of Debai by a Persian Customs vessel has been duly received and note has been taken of the release of the passengers and their belongings. 1 hasten, however, to inform your Excellency that the sugar carried in the boat can in no way be considered to have been smuggled (quite apart from the question of the ownership of the Island of Tunb, with which I shall deal later), as it is obvious that a boat which is undertaking a cruise of six weeks and more must be suitably supplied with provisions. It is also contrary to all international law and usage to seize by force a vessel which is undertaking a peaceful cruise and committing no crime of any description. I must therefore request again that this sugar be released, while reserving the right to claim compensation for this illegal seizure. It is, however, to the statements made in the third and fourth paragraphs of vour Excellency’s note that I must take the greatest exception. In the first place, your Excellency refers to the Island of Abu Musa, which was not even mentioned in my communication to which your note is a reply. I propose, therefore, to refrain from alluding to it at all in this note except for stating that His Majesty’s Government cannot admit any claim to ownership on the part of the Persian Government. In the second place, I have already informed your Excellency, in conversation, that His Majesty’s Government are painfully surprised at this sudden claim of the Persian Government to the Island of Tunb. Your Excellency will, I am sure, appreciate the sympathetic consideration which His Majesty’s Government have always given to Persia’s sovereign rights, but they are unable to admit the claim of the Imperial Government to own this island. In the third place, your Excellency states that the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaima can be considered by the Persian Government neither as independent nor as owner of the island in question.Tt is incumbent on me to inform your Excellency definitely, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, that this sheikh has been in uncontested possession of the island for a great many years and that he is independent except in so far as he is bound by treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. This brings me to the concluding point in your Excellency’s note to the effect that the Imperial Government “ cannot in any way approve of the attitude that the British Government has adopted on the pretext of having treaties with the above- i tioned Arab sheikhs and cannot accept the resulting declaration which they make of protecting them.” His Majesty’s Government entirely fail to understand this statement in view of the fact that the relations between them and the Arab chiefs have existed for 100 years and more, and that definite agreements were made as late as March 1892 with the Chiefs of Ras-le-Khaima and Shargah whereby they agreed inter alia to enter into no agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government. For the information of your Excellency and of the Imperial Government I append to this note the text of the Exclusive Agreement concluded in March 1892 with each of the following sheikhs :— The Chiefs of Abu Dthabi, Dabai, Ajman, Shargah, Ras-ul-Khaima and Umm-ul-Gawain. His Majesty’s Government are therefore unable to admit that the Persian Government should have direct dealings with the chiefs in question, and are further of opinion that if the Persian Government take action against them His Majesty’s Government will be unable to restrain the chiefs from taking retaliatory action, thereby rendering difficult the maintenance of peace in the Persian Gulf. I venture again to remind your Excellency of the assurance given to Sir R. Clive by his Excellency Taimourtache, and to express the opinion that action taken locally will not only be a violation of this assurance, but will also in no way further the claim advanced in your Excellency’s note. I avail, &amp;c. R. C. PARR. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Exclusive Agreement of the Chief of Abu Dthabi with the British Government, dated March 6, 1892.

(The agreements signed by the other Trucial Shiekhs, viz.: the Chiefs of Dabai, Ajman, Shargah, Ras-ul-Khaima and Umm-ul-Gawain, the first three dated the 7th, and the last two the 8th March, 1892, are identical in form.)[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] WI1H reference to my telegram No. 280 of to-day, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a full translation of the note addressed to me by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (No. 13018 of the 20th September) on the subject of the recent seizure of an Arab boat at Tumb Island. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch, and of its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire. (Translation.) M. le Charge d’Affaires, Shahrivar 29, 1307 (September 20, 1928). I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 16th Shahrivar (September 7). Having taken into consideration its contents and the enclosures to it, I have to point out to you that my Government cannot in any way change the views already expressed in my note of the 30th Amerdad (August 21 last). 1. As it has already been pointed out, the Islands of Tumb and Abu Musa are inseparable parts of Persia, and it is a matter of extreme surprise and regret that this indisputable right of Persia should be questioned by the British Government. 2. With regard to the undertakings of the Sheikh of Abu-Dthabi, a copy of which you had sent me with the names of other sheikhs from whom you have stated similar undertakings are possessed, I consider it necessary to point out to you that any agreement which may be against the rights or interests of Persia, or may limit those rights and interests, cannot be recognised as valid and cannot be used as a reason, from a legal point of view, for measures against the Imperial Government of Persia. In conclusion, I have the honour to point out that, according to the proces- verbaux received from the Customs, the boat in question belonged to a Persian subject. There were no more than five passengers on her, and, according to the confession of the captain of the boat and others who have signed the proc'es-verbaux, she was carrying smuggled sugar and tea to the Island of Kishm. It is a matter of deep regret that at this moment the British authorities should raise the question of the seizure of a Persian boat in Persian waters carrying smuggled cargo to a destination in Persia, with the result of its re-echo in the English press contrary to the real facts.

The main points seem to me to he as iollows;- (u) Beiore we resort to extraordinary measures to aeal with the activities ol tne Persian Navy we must exhaust ordinary measures, in the case oi the tacleod incident we protested with satisfactory results; in the case of the Koweiti dhows and the abuse of muscat territorial waters we nave also protested and await a reply . In the case of Basidu the terms of the protest ai e under consideration. As regards the Palang # s visit to Tamo the Charge d’Affaires has been instructed to make a formal protest, the result of which i s no o yet known. «Ve should clearly only be I uo not tnink the line in it is very sound, ana after discussion mr. Seal, I understand, takes tne justified/l ■ justified in resortinb to international uenunciation 1 -l we coula snow tnat over a reasonable perioa it had proved quite inipossihle to ootain any satisfaction from the Persians. (b) We shoula have to leave the Shatt-ai-Arab out of any protest we niaae to the ^eague; that woula be a matter for Iraq, which is now a full member of tne League. Its exclusion woula iLaterially weaken the case for any reference. (c) We coula not possibly, I think, ^o to the League on the grounds suggested in the last six lines of the kemoranuum or require (for that is wnat it would come to) the league to authorise us to occupy Henjam, a piece of Persian territory, in the interests of keeping Older in one Gulf. Nor, even ii tne League were by any chance to support such a proposal, is there tne least prospect that rersia woula agree. (a) Finally, on general grounas we have always been very strongly opposeu in the past (ana the ^amiralty nave in the past been with us) to exciting international interest in tne Gulf or bringing it within tne purview of the league more tnan could oe helped. The A. P.C.C/A.r.u.C. incident is not really parallel, since it ^ arose out of activities In Persia, and if tde League were once to come in ana. by any chance an international commission or board were to be appointed, Persia would have at least as strong a claim as we snoula to membership ana it would be impossible to prevent ner from interfering with the affairs of the Arab Sheikhdoms. I told Iwr. Seal that we agreed with him th^t a policy oi blandishment was unlikely to carry us very ^ar towards getting a satisfactory treaty, but said that it was accepted that we should make another effort to oring trie treaty off and that we must therefore continue to give that policy a chance. 21 . l/wi- 33* CONFIDENTIAL 0 ) 19th August, 1933 Dear Laithwaite I enclose herewith a copy of a memorandum which I have drafted, dealing with the possibility of utilising the activities of the Persian Navy as a appreciate that this memorandum was drafted for internal circulation in the Admiralty primarily, and not for the eye of the Foreign Office; also that it represents so far my own views only, even then in tentative form. I shall be very grateful indeed if, from your long experience of the politics of the Gulf, you could let me know whether you think the line proposed would he feasible. lever in our negotiations with them. You will Yours sincerely, J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., JDM.BRITISH RELATIONS WITH PERSIA, * ) -? ^ The recently reported Persian landing on the Arab Island of Tamb is but the culmination of a series of irresponsible actions on the part of the Persian Navy, which, if unchecked, may have a serious effect on the peace of the Gulf, both by irritating the Arabs on the South shore of the Gulf, possibly to the point of retaliation, and by exacer bating feelings between Persia and Iraq over the question of the Shatt-al-Arab frontier. These actions comprise the dangerous and high handed tactics of the Persian vessels in manoeuvring in the Shatt-al-Arab without complying with the Iraqi port regulations and without consideration for other users of the river and its approaches, and the arrest of Captain Macleod on a trumped up charge when he boarded a Persian vessel in the execution of his duties: activities which are probably the result of orders from Tehran and intended to demonstrate the alleged unfairness of the present frontier. In another part of the Gulf we have seen the outrage at Basidu when the British flag was insulted by the Persian'gunboat 'Palang' and the visit to Tamb to inspect a light on Arab territory; also the less important visit of a Persian ship unannounced to Muscat, where she anchored with a prize, and is stated to have used Muscat territory as a base for operations, not to speak of several incidents where Arab dhows have been seized under obscure circumstances, but probably upon the high seas. These incidents make it clear that to find some means of checking the activities of the Persian Navy is becoming a matter of major importance in the Gulf. The only other matter of comparable importance to H.M.Government is the conclusion of a satisfactory Treaty with Persia, which • • • • •t &gt;2 which must include a continuance of our existing privileges at Henjam and the withdrawal of the Persian claim to Bahrein. The object of this Memorandum is to show that the possibility exists of using the present activities of the Persian Navy as a lever to secure both these ends. It has for some time been apparent that the policy of '’reconciliation” with the Persian Government is all but hopeless as a means of securing a satisfactory Treaty. The more we attempt to blandish the Persians, the more they realise that the Treaty is important to us and unimportant to them, and that we have no whiphand over them. As one would expect, the result has been a steadily growing Persian appetite for concession, and their policy has been periodically to break off negotiations with demands for more every time we have seemed to be within sight of settlement. There is no reason to suppose that the present tension between Russia and Persia will be decisive in drawing them into our net: they are in fact much more likely to attempt to play us off against Russia and vice versa. It has become clear therefore that the only way to handle the Persian Government satisfactorily is to let them see that good behaviour and British friendship will pay them. In the old days, before the advent of the League of Nations, this would have been effected by a show of force - a Naval demonstration or possibly a blockade. The problem is to achieve the same effect under contemporary conditions; and it is suggested that the misbehaviour of the Persian Navy gives us the means of so doing. The procedure therefore would be to appeal at once to the League under Article 12, explaining fully the anxieties which have been caused by the activities of the Persian Navy, emphasising...,emphasising their arbitrary and illegal character, and the threat involved to the tranquiJ&amp;ty of the Gulf, and asking for enquiry by the Council, There is no doubt that when the Anglo-Persian dispute was thus referred to the League the Persian Government evinced a very strong distaste for proceedings at Geneva, and fear that they would be unable to make an adequate defence of their actions there. They are showing all the signs of the so-called f, inferiority complex' 1 , and their very anxiety to appear civilised is almost certainly founded on a sub-conscious knowledge that they are not really fitted to be fully admitted into the comity of nations• The subsequent tactics at Geneva woulc^be to arrange that the inevitable committee and rapporteur should remit the dispute for settlement by negotiation between the parties; and then, under the threat of carrying the matter back to the Geneva committee, get down to Treaty negotiations* Before the dispute was remitted for settlement by negotiation, •, t0 we could probably find an opportunity of explaining/the committee that H.M.Government have long been anxious for a full Treaty settlement, but have been faced by a shilly-shallying attitude on the part of the Persian Govern ment which has made an honourable and lasting Treaty impossible * If we have difficulty in exacting adequate reparation for the flag incident at Basidu, the atmosphere thus created would be more favourable than that which exists at present, but it would be important to avoid demanding reparation which would involve a very serious loss of face for the Persians, if we are out not only to make them respect us, but to negotiate a Treaty which will have a lasting. ....no y / lasting effect in the Gulf. Our action need not raise any question at Geneva as to the ownership of Tanib and Basidu, because it would essentially be based, not on an infringement of territorial rights, but on activities calculated to disturb the peace of the Gulf. The very fact that the ownership of Tamb is disputed makes a visit to it by a warship more objectionable from this point of view • In the subsequent negotiations there seems no reason to fear that a breakdown would occur on this point. It is far more likely that the negotiations would fail on the question of Henjam; if so, and the matter was referred back to Geneva with this as the main outstanding issue, we could at least plead that the presence of the Royal Eavy was essential for the tranquility of the Gulf; that we alone could keep down the slave trade and arms traffic; that an anchorage and depot such as Henjam was essential, and that our occupation inflicted no injury upon Persia.: HT 1 ni Minute Paper.

I have the honour to refer you to the correspondence ending with your No.67 of 19th November regarding the fees -evied on residents of the Gulf ports entering Persia fwtr for pilgrimage. A man named Jafer Sulaiman Dawood 'beaxer of Certificate of Identity No.92 issued on 4th June 1931 by the Political Agent, Muscat was charged 15 Tomans 6 hrans 90 cents on entering Persia via Zahedan, although his certificate showed him to be a British protected subject. Receipt No.38002 issued to him at Zahedan on 3rd Tir Mah i3lQ for this amount, is headed 'Taxes et amendes des sujets indigenes'. 3. It appears from my examination of Jafer that he took the Certificate of Identity, which he failed to exchange at Karachi for a passport, to the Haji*s Camp at Karachi, where he was granted in addition to His Certificate of Identity a Pilgrim Pass No.328 of 9th June 1931 by the District Magistrate Karachi, in which he was described as a British protected person native of village Muscat, Province Oman. On producing this paper to the Persian Consul at Karachi a visa was refused but he was granted a letter authorising him to cross the frontier within 15 days. 4. In this case the following points arises (i; In spite of the protestations of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs inhabitants of the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf and Muscat are treated as Persian subjects as shown by the receipt headed 'Taxes et amend eV des sujet _ indigenes'. jia FOREiGN^Ecr^-^ ^ Persian Consul, Karachi, refused to honour the Utter Nt not* im.Pass issued by the District Magistrate, Karachi Jated ‘ l^cr ibing Jafer as a British protected person. Received 24 AUG. 1931/&lt;?£ Magistrate Karachi to have issued a regular British Passport as the Muscat Certificate of Identity Bore an endorsement 'There being no photographer in Muscat the bearer has been told to get his photograph taken in India, and apply for a regular passport to the nearest passport authority, or a passport will be issued to him, when he produces his photograph in xuuscat'. (4) The form of receipt granted at the Persian frontier to pilgrims from Arab ports which claim them as natives of Persia appears to be objectionable* In this case there is the further objection that the man is actually a British protected person and no t a subject of Muscat. In Muscat State there are a number of Khojas of Indian descent called Hyderabadis who have always retained their nationality and are regularly registered at the British Consulate. Jafer is one of these. The Persian Consul was wrong in treating him as a Muscat subject. 5. I am reporting the case in the hope that you may see your way to taking it up with the Persian Government and recovering the excess fees levied from Jafer. An Indian pilgrim is usually charged Krans 35-60 cents at Zahedan. 6 . As Jafer and his friend Ghulam Dawood whose cases are identical are proceeding on pilgrimage to Kerbela via Tehran I have directed them to report themselves to you. 7.

This is the second occasion of recent date on which a Persian Consular representative in India has seen fit to issue visas for Bahrein. The last instance concerned the Persian Consul at Karacni and was brought to the notice of the Commissioner in Sind in my despatch No.1922 of 21st August 1930. 3. I shall he grateful if instructions can he issued to all Passport Control Officers in India to warn prospective travellers that Persian visas are not valid ior Bahrein and to inform shipping Companies and Travel Agencies likely to he effected, that tickets should in no circumstances he issued to prospective travellers to Bahrein unless they possess a visa Issued h/ a British official. In which V connection please see para 2 of my despatch No.1772 # ' of Slst July 1930.Copy of letter No,93, dated 24th January 1931 froa the Political Agent, .Bahrein, to the Hon’hle the Political Resident, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to draw the attention of the Hon’hle the Political Resident to a visa which has been given on an American Passport No.16, for Piss.Rexroth, hy the Passport Officer to the Oovernment of Bomhay. The number of the visa is 159^8 and the lee was received on the 5th January 1931 but the Government stamp is dated 2nd January 1931. 2. The visa is surprisingly worded as follows:- H 0ood for one or more direct Journeys through ^•gypt within one year (provided that the passport iong valid, undertaken lor the sole purpose of reaching Persia.* The lady obviously could not reach Persia by a direct journey through Egypt and as a matter of fact she has no intention whatever of going to Persia. She sent me her passport on arrival at Bahrein as it had a similar visa No.15999 for ’Irag of the same date, a visa for a 'direct journey for the sole purpose of reaching Persia', since she feared that difficulties would be raised when it was found she was not going to Persia. I have given her a transit visa for *Ira&lt;i and have advised her to obtain a normal visa for Egypt in Baghdad. 3. further I notice on her passport a gratis visa ftby the Persian Consul at Bombay for 'Bahrein, Iran'. This I am cancelling, as the statement cannot be allowed to pass, and also as the Persian Consul has o business whatever to give visas of any kind for Bahrein. I MV - 2 - 4 . I undersland, on enquiry, ihat these visas aere ohtained for the lady hy the American Express and that the supposed Persian visa *as obtained because she might v*ish to go ashore at some Persian rhilf ports. Actually she has no Persian visa and consequently cannot land in Persia but only this irreguiar visa I have mentioned above for 'Bahrein, Persia', for v,hich no fee was charged.

Monsieur le Ministre, in reply to Your Excellency's esteemed ing the travellers inhabiting the southern coasts of the Persian Gulf in general and a number of travellers from Muscat (gone) to the Khorasan regions in particular, I have the honour to state that as the imperial Government have not recognised the form of Government of the states of the southern coasts of the Persian Gulf and as they (the Persian Government) have no relations with them, and, as on the other hand, no census has ever been made of a large number of Persians who are residing on the southern coasts of the Persian Gulf and who have no identity papers or passports and as it has often been observed that the holders of passports or identity papers issued by the sheikhs of the Gulf coasts are Persians who, for the lack of a guardian, were compelled to take out travelling papers from the latter Sheikhs {and therefore for these reasons it was not possible to recognise such papers and issue visas on them, instructions have been issued by the Imperial Government to the frontier officials to issue exit and entry passes to travellers coming from the southern coasts of the Gulf on their entry into Persian territory against payment by them A jotr'io note Ho. 310 of Shahrivar 19th (September loth 1930) regard- /V; v of statutory fees. #■ statements made by the frontier officials at KhosroviKhosrovi to the travellers from liuscat alluded to in the report from the British Consulate-Oeneral (in Meshed) if actually made, were unfounded and inopportune.

Clive- Extract from despatch No. 64. dated 2nd September, 1930, addressed to His Majesty's Minister by His Majesty's Consul Oeneral at Meshed. I have the honour to report that tfafar Abdul Rahim has represented to me that he with a party which included his mother and wife, some relatives children and servants, left Muscat in April 1930 for Iraq by way of Basra The maid servant S-udian was to be left behind in Iraq but wishing to obtain visas for the rest of the party to enter Persia, Jafar Abdul Rahim applied to the Persian Consulate In Baghdad. The Consul refused to grant visas but provided a series of letters addressed to the Customs Authorities in Sarhadi-Khosrouvi stating that the holders should not be prevented from entering Persian territory and should be treated as Muscat subjects. In this connect ion it v/ill be obaerved from the attached list showing the members of the party and the exact travel documents held, that two of them were British subjects by birth. Yhen the party reached IChosrouvi objections were raised at the passport examination office to their entering Persian territory without Persian passports since, they were told, Muscat belonged to Persia. The officerin charge of the passport office then collected a levy of six tomans, two krans, two ahahis (the fee for a Persian passport) in respect of each pex'son and provided a further aeries of papers on which it was stated that the bearer had entered the country without a passport. The total amount paid at the passport office, iOiosrouvi, was fifty tomans, eight krans and eighteen ahahis. The officer in charge moreover told the party that they would not be allowed to return to Muscat unless they took out Persian passports...,.List showing the members cf the party and the exact travel documents held by them.

Un several occasions during the last year I have been compelled to protest against this entirely unjustifiable conduct on trie part of the officials concerned, and have pointed out that the subjects of a state such as Muscat, to which, as far as I am aware, the Persian Government has never laid claim, cannot possibly be regarded as Persian subjects, anu are entitled to exactly the same consideration as any other foreign national who may visit this country. This applies with equal force to the natives of um&amp;n and huwait.

The views of the Political Resident are given in his telegram of 19th June, No.625 on P.3875. The statement made in that telegram that Muscat passports are impounded by the Persian Authorities has since been corrected (Resident’s Express letter of 24th June, copy flagged A). Sir R.Clive's views are given in the Viceroy’s telegram of 1st July. The 0.of I. have no comments to offer in addition to those of the Resident and H.M's. Minister. There does not seem anything which can usefully be added to the views expressed by Colonel Biscoe and Sir R. Clive. We clearly cannot expect a satisfactory solution of the passport difficulty until the negotiations with Persia on the question of the status of Bahrein and of the other principalities of the Arab littoral have reached a conclusion. The refusal of the local Persian authorities in the Gulf to recognise Muscati and Koweiti passports has apparently formed the subject of a further protest by H.M’s. Minister.

BRITISH COWSULiiTE, BASRA, 1 Iraq, February 14th, 1930. Description of Enclosure Hame and Date Subject Copy of Basra despatch Wo.323 dated February Refusal to grant Visas on Certificates of Identity by 11, 1930, to Tehran Persian Consulate, BasraCopy No.323. (T ^591/60/378) British Consulate BASRA 1 1raq February 11th, 1930 Sir I have the honour to iniorm you that the Persian Consulate at this port is no longer prepared to issue visas to holders or single sheet foolscap certificates of identity, as used by H.M.Consul at Ahwaz, the Acting British Vice-Consul at Hohammerah, and the political agencies in the Persian Gulf, in view of instructions received to affix visas only on national passports of regular type. I enclose herewith a copy of a letter which I have to-day received from my Persian colleague in this connection. This is a development, as you will realise. Sir, which requires examination as a large number of travellers of humble situation and means will be affected by these new dispositions in Persian chanceries, which apply, I am informed by Monsieur Badie, to pilgrims as well. 2. The certificates of identity alluded to above are issued, if I am not labouring under a misconception, in place of emergency certificates and are, in fact, on the face of them designed to facilitate the journey of the holders to one definite destination only, as is the case with emergency certificates, although instances have been brought to my notice where they have been issued tor a destination with the addition of the words 'and return'. They seem to be, however, the only type of travel document which the average denizen of the Pearl (or Persian) Gulf /is H. M. Minister British Legation TehranI.LSl zIvTa. /x&lt;*4 ^ Crxiuvi f * 'wr* ‘f ^ - U rrciizr ffTKfttL- Ijo— is able to obtain and is, in ract, constantly employed by, for instance, Bahreinis and occasional Kuweitis and Muscatis, not to mention Indians from Khuzistan, for travelling in these parts to visit their relatives or for purposes of business. 3. The direct result of the operation of these new Persian regulations will be to close the Iranian frontier wall more firmly, a result with which, in most aspects, we would doubtless have no quarrel. It does, however, unduly affect British subjects resident in Khuzistan who cross over into 'Iraq on a certificate of identity, and then have to take out a passport in order to return. Bahreinis, being already under their dual nationality cloud, are not affected by the new regulation, but Kuweitis desirous of visiting Persia would appear to be definitely excluded from the country, and the same would x appear to apply to Muscatis. 4. A solution might, conceivably, be found in having a certificate of identity of a general type, suitable for use at all posts where now it is used, made in booklet form with a cloth cover similar in appearance to the regular passport. I am inclined to believe, however that the intention of this new Persian regulation is to abolish the granting of travel facilities to any but holders of an unimpeachable, 'full-blown' passport. 5. A copy hereof has been sent to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, His Excellency the High Commissioner for 'Iraq, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, the Hon'ble the Political Resident and Consul-General at Bushire, H.M.Consul at Ahwaz, and the Acting British Vice-Consul at Mohammerah.

(b) Those of the British and Iraq, subjects, holding Temporary Certificates or Identity issued by British Oxiicials in Persia instead or Nationality passports, will be given an exit visa to leave Persia, but such persons, in case they wanted to return to Persia, must be in possession or their respective Nationality Passports, duly endorsed with the necessary Visa to Persia oy the authorised Persian Officials abroad.

A i; opy of ^his latter document has now been secured unofficially by the Minister from the Director-General of Customs, and is contained in Tehran telegram 347 on P. 6916, now submitted. \The circular is a loosely worded document, and by itself is not of very great importance. Paragraph 2 is definitely objectionable, on the ground that the Ilm-o-Khabar are used for travelling between one Persian port and another, and that the implication is therefore that the Arab littoral is under Persian suzerainty. But in considering the degree of objectionableness of this clause, it should be remembered that at the time when the order (4 %rJ t _ was issued, fwe were on tne point of reaching an understanding with Persia in which we tacitly acquiesced in the use of Ilm-o-Khabar for convenience* sake in the case of Bahrein (see paragraph 10 of India Office memorandum on passport arrangements, flagged). The same holds good .of the instruction in paragraph 3 (which must be read with paragraph 1) that natives of Oman, Dabai, Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit need have no more than a “ticket' - by which presumably is meant an Ilm-o-Khabar - in order to leave Persia. The instruction in paragraphs 1 and 3 that inhabitants of Koweit, Oman, Dabai, Muscat and Bahrein must pay the price of a Persian passport on entry into Persia is clearly open to objection. The Persians, if pressed on of Tehran despatch 473 of the 9th November, on ?. 6374/28, flagged) that the passport is not actually issued, and that the fee in question is merely a landing charge. But the Political Resident, in his telegram of the 29th October, 1928, No. 1077, definitely states that passports are issued, and if on this question of fact his statement is correct, we be in a stronger position to make remonstrances to the Persian Government. this point, will no doubt say (compare last two sentences rUJLKs In any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ N °- £ &lt;&lt;&gt; C U -0 ft* *79f and address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. t. r V \ f 91 6 Gonflc.eniia^ / s THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to sfjLjLs' ^ ( '*T^cCxJ&lt;eu / and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

It is indeed the case that no formal demand has so far been put forward by the Persian Government to the League of Nations, or to any other body, that its suzerainty over Muscat should be recognised, but, as will have been seen from the previous discussion on P. 5881, flagged below, a number of instructions have recently been issued with the approval of the Persian Foreign Office and otherwise, the trend of which is to suggest that such a claim is reasonable, .

Johnston.m ^ | This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] WITH reference to recent telegrams sent from Bushire to the Government of Arab States on arrival in Persia, and their obligation to pay the price of a Persian passport when arriving in a Persian port, I have the honour to report that the Belgian Administrator of Customs informs me that in 1925 the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs issued these instructions and called upon the customs officers in the Gulf ports to put them into execution. The recent renewal of these orders was occasioned by the fact that Bushire and Bunder Abbas were not acting in harmony with each other in the matter. The Administrator-General is ignorant of the reasons which prompted the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to issue these orders, but he tells me that the Persian passport is not actually issued for the money received, and only a receipt is given. There is here a discrepancy, as Bushire telegram No. 1077 of the 29th October says that passports are actually issued. 2. So far as the records of the relations between Muscat and Persia are concerned, I know of no attempt by the Persians to claim suzerainty over Muscat. In this connexion it will not be without interest to your Lordship to read the transla tion of part of an article relating to Muscat which appeared in the Tehran paper “ Sitareh Iran ” on the 5th November over the signature of the editor of the paper himself. I beg to enclose herewith a translation of the part of the article which refers to Muscat and the need for Persia to make a treaty with that State. The article portrayed the relations of Persia with Iraq principally, and then went on to discuss the Hejaz before finishing up with Muscat. It is particularly interesting, because the Tehran press is subject to more or less strict censorship, and the mere fact of such an article appearing in a censored paper and over the signature of the editor lends it a degree of importance. P.S.—Copies of this despatch and of its enclosure are being sent to the Government of India and His Majesty’s consul-general, Bushire. (Translation.) IN the same way the conclusion of a treaty with Imam of Muscat, who is at present the guest of the British Government in London, is of great necessity for the Persian Government, because Cape Mussandam, the northern point of Omam, stretches like a horn towards the Straits of Hormuz and the south coast of Persia! and we must act so as to be able to keep the entrance to the Persian Gulf free. We hope particularly that the Minister of Court will study this vital question, because at this time, when we wish rightfully to appropriate to ourselves supremacy in the Gulf, it is necessary to conclude a treaty with the Imam of Muscat so as to secure the freedom of Cape Mussandam and to prevent the construction of any fortifications at that point.

The Secretary of State entirely agrees as to the desirability of examining, in consultation with the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the question of retaliatory passport measures, and he concurs in the draft telegram which lord Peel proposes to send to the Government of India. 3. Copies of this letter have been sent to the Colonial Office, ^ir Ministry and admiralty. I am.HJkri (Xula, ^ be C&amp;. U*. ^A. O- *J±X* . k-L Memorandum . I discussed with i'r. B.S. Thomas yesterday the question of retaliatory action in the matter of passports, etc., against Persia in connection with Persian claims to suzerainty over Muscat, and told him of the report we had received as to the action taken independently by the Sheikh of Bahrein. Mr. Thomas said that the Sultan of Muscat could be relied upon to take v/hatever action His Majesty's Government desired him to take in the matter. He was inclined, however, to think that would objection to an arrangement under which British Consular officers on the Persian shore were entitled to take action on behalf of Muscat in the matter. The status of Muscat was different from that of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, in that its foreign . relations were not controlled by His Majesty's Government. Kis Majesty's Government did not extend their protection to H; muscat is in Persia in the same way as to the subjects of the * . other States, and there was a danger that Baruni, the Tripolitan Minister of the Imam of Muscat, would make political trouble elsewhere in the Arab world by instancing the issue of visas by our officials on behalf of the Sultan as an illustration of the fact that the Sultan was under complete control, and that a protectorate had in fact been esuablisned. He thougnt the best course would probably be that the Sultan should impose on all Persians landing in uscat^a retaliatory fee, and possibly should also require them to have their passports vise by the Muscat authorities before landing. It would not, he thought, in practice, be possible to impose any strict control of this nature in the Lusandim area, with which a considerable amount oTMrahe took \ place/place from the Persian coast, but the principle would be safeguarded if general instructions were issued by the Pus cat authorities, even if these v/ere not carried out’ in those areas in which local conditions made action difficult. I asked Mr. Thomas if he could say, from his personal knowledge of the Trucial coast, to what extent any action on similar lines was practicable there. Ke replied that he thought the difficulties would be exceedingly great; that the Residency Agent at Shargah, Isa, could without difficulty probably get letters from all the Sheikhs protesting against the Persian action and intimating that, failing withdrawal of the obnoxious circulars, they would take retaliatory action; but that, in practice, it would be very difficult indeed to take such action. The Sheikhs, (fcy - **y, t Ji ^ C^ulcTnotYgo against tile general will of their people in the matter, and the smuggling trade, especially from Dabai, CsJCu* was much too important for thesr to sacrifice. Here again, however, the principle would perhaps be saved by the issue of instructions, even if these were not complied with, and by the transmission to the Central Government in Tehran of the substance of the communications secured from the Sheikhs.Minute Paper political Department. Please see previous discussion on P. 5774/28. The receipt oi the Government of India’s telegram of the 31st October, which appearec to take the same line as that suggested in the draft telegram on P. 5774, rendered the despatch of that telegram unnecessary. The point now for consideration is the action to be taken in face of the Persian claims, first to sovereignty or suzerainty over Muscat, secondly, to suzerainty over the Arab littoral, with the apparent exception of Hasa. The decision must inevitably be influenced by Sir Lionel Haworth's further telegram of the 29th October on P. 5840, giving details of the fresh Persian order as regards the passports of subjects of the States on the Arab littoral of the Gulf who may enter Persian territory (it is assumed in this connection that M at M in the third line of the telegram in Question is a mistake for 'from'). Reference is invited in the same connection to the reply by the High Commissioner for Iraq to the enquiries addressed to him in August in regard to the refusal of the Persian Consul at Basra to visa the British passport held by a Bahrein subject, and in particular to the statements in paragraphs 3 (IV) and 3 (V) of that f* despatch, which show that, while the practice of local Persian officials is not uniform, at any rate the Persian Consul at Basra (whom we separately know of as a thorn in the side of the Iraq authorities) insists that Bahreinis travelling in Persia shall hold a full Persian 2871 5000 0.28 passport/passport, erid not an Ilm-c-Khabar, and further that, prior to the issue of the Persian passport, • © they shall surrender any British passport v/hich they may hold. It is understood that Lord Peel feels sane doubt as to whether the present moment, when we are just about to resume negotiations with Persia, is the best that could be chosen for taking up as vigorously as we should be justified in doing the Muscat case against Persia, and that it might be better to wait a little while and see how the negotiations go before raising it. The Department would suggest, in these circumstances, that the simplest course would be to delay action for, say, a month or six weeks (there is no pressing urgency so far as Muscat is concerned. The Sultan will not be back in Bonbay or his State until the beginning of 1929, and further reference to the Government of India may be called for before a final decision as to tactics can be taken), by which time it should be possible to see how the negotiations with Persia are beginning to go, and then to act on the lines suggested by the Government of India in their telegram of the 31st October on P. 5874, coupling with our representations to Persia about Muscat, which should be extended to t cover the case of the other Gulf States under our c protection, an intimation that, failing withdrawal of the obnoxious orders, the Arab Rulers affected will be advised (or allowed) to take retaliatory action as regards the production of passports or visas by Persians entering their States.

It is clearly impossible to acquiesce in a Persian claim to suzerainty, in however unsubstantial a form, over the Arab littoral. Action on the lines v/hich are at present being followed by Persia, if left to continue without interference, is bound to react adversely on our prestige locally, and retaliatory action on the general^lines suggested above would at once affirm in the eyes of the Gulf States our view of their/their position vis -a- vis Persia, and would make it clear to the Persians that we did not intend to let matters go by default. c A draft letter to the Foreign Office on the c lines above, enclosing for their concurrence a draft telegram of instructions to the Government of India and the Political Resident, is submitted for consideration. It is understood that they would not be ill disposed to action on the lines suggested. u ICkc.zZ. The whole subject of Persian arrangements in regard to passports and similar documents is exceedingly obscure. imo doubt the Persian practice (or variety of practices) is inconvenient and irritating to travellers; and there seems no doubt that it is also unreasonable and based on objectionable implications as'.to Persian claims of some sort over Bahrein and the Arab side of the Gulf. Dut most of our evidence as to the actual making of such claims (except of course as to Bahrein) at present consists of second or third-hand reports of what local Persian officials or other obscure persons are stated to have said - reports which are very confusing and even conflicting - e.g. one of the items of hearsay information in the Baghdad despatch of the 6th October is that the receipt given to Bahreinis at Muhammerah is headed “Receipt for payment from foreign subjects'. Sir L.Haworth’s telegrams Nos. 1061 and lu77 however quote documents issued by the Central authorities in Tehran, of which the Resident presumably has copies. The suggested counter-measures on the Arab side may well be desirable, and couldMinute Paper Department '■'S be defended, in any case. But if we are to protest against the Persian practice, or base the counter-measures upon it, it seems very desirable to make sure of our footing by obtaining the actual text of these documents. A good deal turns on the precise wording (and on the translation). So far as can be gathered from the telegrams, neither document states categorically that Oman etc. are Persian territory, or that Omanis etc. are Persian subjects (though they are in some sense ’counted as' such). I have suggested an addition to the draft telegram accordingly.4 0 Draft Paper. /s The Ibder Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. ft. S.fr-O.J* &amp;dC(j.

I am further to invite attention, in this connection, to the despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. C.0./1156, dated the 6th October, of which a copy is understood to have been communicated to your Department by the Colonial Office, relative to the refusal of the Persian Consul at Basra to endorse the British passports of certain natives of Bahrein. 2. Ahe Arab States affected by the Persian claim fall into two categories. The first category embraces Muscat, which is an independent State in treaty relations not only with His Majesty’s Government but with France, the United ftates and Holland, but which is not diplomatically represented at 1635 a 50:)3 1.27 Tehran/Tehran. The second category embraces the Arab States of Bahrein,f-Koweit, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, the foreign relations of which are conducted by His Majesty's Government! which are entitled in varying degrees to a measure of protection or to good offices from His Majesty's Government; and which are precluded from direct diplomatic relations with Persia or other Foreign Governments. 3 \s Lord Peel understands the position, it is the considered policy of His Majesty's Government that Persian aggression on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf or against those islands in the Gulf which are recognised by His Majesty's Government as the property of the Arali Rulers, or to which a claim has been or may be preferred by those Rulers, should not be tolerated, and that an uncompromising attitude should be adopted in.dealing with any Persian claim of the nature now under discussion. On this assumption, the question now for consideration is the line of action to be adopted in dealing with Persia in regard to the series of incidents now.under eonnidoraution. It will be seen that in the case of Huscat, the Government of India have suggested that advantage! might be seen in advising the SultanDraft Paper political Department 1685 a. 5000 1.27 to address a representation on the subject to the League of Nation^ and it is clear that a special procedure will be called for in the caseof this State, the status of which, as explained fabove, differs from that of the other Principalities affected. Lord Peel, however, is inclined to see strong objection to referring to the League of Nations any question in connection with the position of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf which can satisfactorily be dealt with otherwise, and he is disposed to the I n view that the most satisfactory cotlFseTwill be that simultaneous representations in strong terms should be made by His Majesty’s Minister in regard to the whole series of incidents now und-cr ration - Sir Robert Clive’s action in the case of Muscat being based on a formal request to be made by the Sultan for our good offices in the matter, founded on the fact that His Highness has no diplomatic representative at Tehran,-and that the Persian Government should be warned that, failing the withdrawal of the obnoxious/obnoxious instructions, the Arab Rulers affected will be left free to take such retaliatory action in the matter of passports as may seem good to them. The Secretary of State recognises the possibility that representations of this nature . to the Persian Government at the outset of the negotiations now to be : undertaken by Sir Robert Clive may react prejudicially on the progress of those negotiations, and he would » see no objection, therefore, to postponing oontfrtion until, say, the end of the year, by which time.it is hoped,^the Sultan of Ruscat will have returned to his State, and it will have been possible to appreciate the general attitude towards His Majesty’s Government of Persia. 4 It will be remembered that the •question of retaliatory action against Persia in the matter of passports, etc., was considered in 1922 and 1923 in connection with Bahrein, and that the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office, after considering the views of the then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, - approved the principle of such^ Draft Paper.

The whole question of Persian travelling passes and the people to whom they should properly be issued, is very involved, and had the Customs Department confined themselves to informing the merchant that for travelling in Persia he would require a Persian travelling pass, or Ilm-o-Khabar, we might perhaps have left matters, the formal intimation of which a copy has been communicated to Sir Lionel Haworth that Persia claims that Muscat is part of her dominions cannot, fit is suggested, well be passed over in silence. At the same time, our position for making representations is very difficult, for Muscat is an independent State, the foreigi relations of which we do not profess to control. It is very undesirable, I submit, to encourage Muscat to submit an appeal to the League of Nations, and the proposal to recall the Sultan to London for the purpose may equally be regarded as unsound. Subject to any/any views which the Government of India may express, the simplest course would appear to be that Muscat should ask us to make representations to Persia in the matter on their behalf, on the ground that they have themselves no diplomatic representative at Tehran who could do this for them. But we must first hear the views of the Government of India, and in view of the possibility that this point may be referred to in the next meeting of the Persian Gulf Cub-Conmittee, which is understood to have been fixed for the 12th November, and at which Sir Denys Bray will attend, I suggest that we might telegraph to them as in the draft. ^/f. 5T .&gt; Draft Paper political Department.

I REGRET to have to draw your Excellency’s attention to a most serious incident which has been brought about by the action of a Persian Customs motor boat at the Island of Tunb situated in the Persian Gulf to the south of Kishm. 2. It appears that for some time past the Persian boat has been operating from Tunb, and now, at the end of July, it has seized a sailing boat belonging to the port of Debai and taken the boat, together with its fifteen women and children passengers, to Lingah. 3. I am informed that the passengers have been deprived of all their belongings, money, jewels and even clothes, and both they and the boat have been detained at Lingah. The boat carried no cargo. 4. The Island of Tunb belongs to the Arab Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimeh, who is allied to the family of the Sheikh of Shargah. In capturing a sailing boat belonging to a foreign subject within the territorial waters of an i ndependen t A rab she ikh i&amp;_ an act of ultra vires on the part of the Persian authorities concerned, and is, moreover, contrary to international law and usage. In view of the treaties which exist between these Arab sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government, I have, on the instructions of my Government, to register a serious protest against this arbitrary act. 5. I have therefore the honour to request that the Imperial Government will at once issue instructions to the competent department to release the boat and its passengers immediately and to restore to the latter all the belongings of which they have been deprived. I am further to add that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves full liberty to present to the Imperial Government a claim for compensation on behalf of the people who have been treated in this manner. I avail, &amp;c. R. C. PARR. [576 aa—3]Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

YOUR note No. 204 of Amerdad 13th (August 4), stating that the Persian Customs boat has held up a sailing boat belonging to the port of Debai and has taken^ the said boat, together with its passengers, to Bandar Lingah and confiscated their belongings, was duly received. As the Ministry of Finance writes, the boat in question was carrying smuggled sugar, and that, after the boat was taken to Lingah, the smuggled sugar was confiscated according to the laws in force, the passengers were released and their effects returned to them. The statement made in your note under reply to the effect that the action taken by Persian officials in capturing a boat belonging to a foreign subject, and that within the territorial waters of an independent sheikh, has been accounted an act of ultra vires and is contrary~T6 international law and usage has caused me great astonishment.

On the contrary, this attitude of the British Government is \ contrary to the sincere and friendly relations which exist between the two Govern- J ments and my Government strongly protests against it. I avail, &amp;c. v PAKREVAN. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. Parr to M. Pakrevan. M. le Gerant, Gidhek, September 7, 1928. YOUR note No. 11024 of the 21st August in regard to the seizure of a sailing boat belonging to the port of Debai by a Persian Customs vessel has been duly received and note has been taken of the release of the passengers and their belongings. 1 hasten, however, to inform your Excellency that the sugar carried in the boat can in no way be considered to have been smuggled (quite apart from the question of the ownership of the Island of Tunb, with which I shall deal later), as it is obvious that a boat which is undertaking a cruise of six weeks and more must be suitably supplied with provisions. It is also contrary to all international law and usage to seize by force a vessel which is undertaking a peaceful cruise and committing no crime of any description. I must therefore request again that this sugar be released, while reserving the right to claim compensation for this illegal seizure. It is, however, to the statements made in the third and fourth paragraphs of vour Excellency’s note that I must take the greatest exception. In the first place, your Excellency refers to the Island of Abu Musa, which was not even mentioned in my communication to which your note is a reply. I propose, therefore, to refrain from alluding to it at all in this note except for stating that His Majesty’s Government cannot admit any claim to ownership on the part of the Persian Government. , In the second place, I have already informed your Excellency, in conversation, that His Majesty’s Government are painfully surprised at this sudden claim of the Persian Government to the Island of Tunb. Your Excellency will, I am sure, appreciate the sympathetic consideration which His Majesty’s Government have always given to Persia’s sovereign rights, but they are unable to admit the claim of the Imperial Government to own this island. In the third place, your Excellency states that the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaima | can ^ considered by the Persian Government neither as independent nor as owner of the island in question.3 It is incumbent on me to inform your Excellency definitely, on behalf of His U Majesty’s Government, that this sheikh has been in uncontested possession of the island for a great many years and that he is independent except in so far as he is bound by treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. This brings me to the concluding point in your Excellency’s note to the effect f that the Imperial Government “ cannot in any way approve of the attitude that the jlritish Government has adopted on the pretext of having treaties with the above- entioned Arab sheikhs and cannot accept the resulting declaration which they make of protecting them.” His Majesty’s Government entirely fail to understand this statement in view of the fact that the relations between them and the Arab chiefs have existed for 100 years and more, and that definite agreements were made as late as March 1892 with the Chiefs of Ras-le-Khaima and Shargah whereby they agreed inter alia to enter into no agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government. For the information of your Excellency and of the Imperial Government I append to this note the text of the Exclusive Agreement concluded in March 1892 with each of the following sheikhs :— The Chiefs of Abu Dthabi, Dabai, Ajman, Shargah, Ras-ul-Khaima and Umm-ul-Gawain. His Majesty’s Government are therefore unable to admit that the Persian Government should have direct dealings with the chiefs in question, and are further of opinion that if the Persian Government take action against them His Majesty’s Government will be unable to restrain the chiefs from taking retaliatory action, thereby rendering difficult the maintenance of peace in the Persian Gulf. I venture again to remind your Excellency of the assurance given to Sir R.

Early in 1910, the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be complied with in the case of persons visiting Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of travellers to Persian ports, a measure which., as pointed cut by the Foreign office at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to assert Persian sovereignty over the Islands. H.l'.G. agreed however that in vie^ of the undesirability of raising the general question of the status of Bahrein, no protest should be made. 2 . In July 1910, the Political resident reported that internal Persian coastal passes (Ilm-o-Khabar) issued to Persians proceeding to Bahrein from Persian ports were vise by a Persian merchant residing in Bahrein, who was also in the habit of issuing similar passes to Persians proceeding from Bahrein to the Persian Ports, and H.M.G. approved a proposal that the merchant in question,Abdul Fabi, should he expelled from the Islands. For various reasons it was found necessary to suspapd action in this authority: but in 1912 Abdul Nabi wa.s forbidden to ts.k&gt;c any action in regard to the endorsement of Passes held by Persia subjects for oravel in Bahrein. The endorsements in t question '-ere ho’-ever thenceforth grantedby the Political A^ent, a practice, as pointed out by the Political- Resident &lt;x x Letter to G/I. nine years later, ' of itself open to P94 8. 3rd Pjec.1922. objection, ss it rri^ht be construed into * a tacit admission that the Persian rassport authorities are Justified in giving passes for another Persian port *v XL to persons going to Ballrein ,, . 3, In June 1922, ConsuJ at Bunder Abbas repprted that the Persian passport officials at Lingah, at which port British India S.N.

The Political Resident vhile mentioning that the requirements of a 'British visa would pre^^ hardly on travellers from small ports remote from a British Consular officer concurred. The Government of India agreed on the* un,der- slanding that H.M.G. were prepared to face the reopening of the question of the status of Bahrein v hich the proposal involved: the / Porei^gn Office and Colonial Office saw no objection to Immediate action, and Lord . Curzbn, in correspondence with Viscount Peel, then Secretary of State for India, expressed his satisfaction with the action contemplated. But on the motion of the Minister at Tehran, the matter va,s dropped for the time in the hope that the new X Persian Government, prove more amenable. 5. These hooe* v 'ere not realised, 'and in May 1923, vhen the presentation of a Note to Persia, intimating that her preten sions in Bahrein could not he recognised, was under consideration, the Government of India expressed the view that the withdrawal by p ersia of passport measures affecting the Islands should be included.

Cn 3Cth June 1923, the F.O. 'after consideration of the viev's of -the Political Resident, proposed to instruct the Minister to inform the Persian Government that if they did. not withdraw their instructions to the ocrt authorities in the Gulf, H.M.G. would institute their own passport regulations for travellers proceeding to and. from Bahrein; a v • oronosal in which the India Office x I.O.to F.o.nth x July 1923.

H.M.Minister in these circum stances took back the Note Verbale 'hich he had presented. 9. In October 1925, the Minister at Tehran, in reply to a letter from the Political Pesiden-’ forwarding a petition from certain Bahreini merchants living in Mohammerah regarding the claim of the local Persian authorities that they should X take out Persian passports, said 'The present Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom I have privately complained on many occasions about this obstruction has now proposed, and h s instructed his officials in the Southern ports to that effect,that the new Persian oass-ort Regulations, ''hich reouired every traveller to be furnished with a passport, shall not s.-^ly Bahreinis, whowin pe s,llo’'ed to revert to the use of a form of identity paper known as ”ilm u Khabar' '-hich was formerly recognised as sufficient for Bahreinis travelling in the Persian Gulf'.Sir P.Loraine added that, the Bahrein cuestion sprearing an impaa r, e, a. compromise on these lines v'ould a. least obviate the practical difficulties at present experienced by Bahreinis travelling between ports in the Gulf. the Minister.

The India Office acquiesced in (a), (b) and (d) above, but vigorously dissented from (c), and the Foreign Office as a compromise suggested the maintenance of (c) on the understanding that such certificates should be employed' merely as a recommendation to British officials”, and should have-added to them a clause to that effect and to the effect ' that they are not intended for x production to foreign authorities. 13. The India Office with much reluctance agreed to the cornuremise subject to the views of the Government of India, but added that the most satisfactory solution w^uld be that the Sheikh should, as had been the practice prior to 1915, issue his own travelling passes. They agreed however that permission so to act should be withheld from His Excellency so long as the governing fi I.C. to F.O. political considerations made this desirable. 8.3.27.P.17/27. 14.

They further agreed with the Political Resident that the ilm-o-Khabar' can safely be ignored, especially since these are also being issued tor Koweit, the status of which is not in dispute* The Foreign r ffice on 2nd November 1°27 agreed x in reply” that no action should he taken unless and until the Question again 'becomes acute'* Since that date it has slumbered until revived by the case of Haji Hanfish. j.G.Laithwaite.3152/23 No .927-Cr.

It is understood that, so far as subjects of these nationalities are concerned, the orders quoted are still in force. A somewhat different question has now arisen. During the war, all foreigners were required, under the Defence of India (Passport) Rules of 1917, to obtain a ® r iti£h visa on their passports before embarking at any port in British India, whether the port of destination was British or not.

India Office, Sir, 5th December 1914. 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India to inform you that he has received a letter from the Colonial OHice (No. 46,508, of the 28th November 1914) transmitting an enquiry from the High Commissioner of the Malay States as to the legal position of Arabs from the Hadramaut and the Hedjaz. It is understood that a similar communication has been addressed to your Department. As regards the Hadramaut, the position is, as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is aware, that llis Majesty’s Government have concluded “ protectorate ’ treaties with the following Arab chieftains in that region: The Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, representing the Kaiti tribe; the Sultan of Socotra and Kishn, representing the Mahri tribe; and the Sultans of Bir Ali and Balahaf, representing the two main sections of the Waiiidi tribe. The subjects of these rulers would appear to be the only Arabs in the Hadramaut who are strictly entitled to British protection. But the Marquess of Crewe considers that, in existing circumstances, there would be advantage in treating as British protected persons for the purpose in view all Arabs, whatever their tribe or section, from that portion of the coast belt of South Arabia which lies between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Oman. Reference is invited in this connection to the last paragraph of my letter of the 16th July last, No. B. 2375. If Sir E. Grey agrees, Lord Crewe would propose to inform the Colonial Office that the legal position of all Arabs from the Hadramaut (t.e., from the coastal area lying between the limits above mentioned) is that of British protected persons. With regard to the Uedjaz, his Lordship understands that district to be Ottoman territory, and its inhabitants Turkish subjects.

It will be seen that the Resident at Aden has been instructed to furnish Mr. Gurney direct with the required particulars as to districts, &amp;c., in the Aden settlement and Perim, the natives of which are British subjects, and with a complete list of the protected Chiefs of the Aden Hinterland and the Hadramaut (including Soc otra). 1 lie subjects of these protected Chiefs are the only persons in the neigh-j bourhood of Aden- apart from British subjects— who are strictly entitled to] the good offices of His Majesty’s representatives abroad. But there is force ini the views expressed by the Resident at Aden as to the undesirability, in present circumstances, of drawing a hard and fast distinction between those Arab rulers who are. and those who are not, in treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government; and the Marquess of Crewe would suggest therefore that Mr. (iiirney be instructed to treat as British protected persons all Arabs from the Aden region and the Hadramaut, i.e., the whole coastal district lying between the Turkish border and the limits of Oman, irrespective of the particular district or tribe to which they belong. This course would accord with the policy advocated in my letter of the oth December respecting the treatment of Arabs from the Hadramaut in the Malay States. It appears very improbable that objection will be raised by the French authorities; but should the Consul-General’s action be challenged, there would be little difficulty in furnishing satisfactory explanations of a measure dictated by military and political considerations which are of importance, at the present critical juncture, not only to Great Britain but indirectly to all the Allied Powers. As Sir h. Grey is aware, the Government ol India were recently consulted (sec paragraph 2 of Lord Crewe’s Secret Despatch No. 37, dated the 6th November 1914)' ;:: ‘ as to the measures necessary to regularise and complete the protectorate of His Majesty’s Government on the whole coast belt of South Arabia west of Oman territory. 1 have, &amp;c..

The desirability of cancelling these Proclamations (and in particular the Muscat one, which gives Persia powers on the high seas) has been considered before and so far as I can recollect the decision always was not to do so unless the Persians show signs that they are aware of the fact that the Proclamations exist. 3. The reason for this decision was that there is in existence a Persian 'firman” of 1897 under which the Shah empowered H.M. Ships in the Persian Gulf to examine and search Persian Merchant Ships in the Gulf. The existence of this firman might be of use if there is ever a recrudes cence of arms traffic^ and it was felt that if the attention of the Persians is drawn to the records of that time by the cancellation of the Muscat Proclamation they are likely to discover the existence of their own firman. 4. The instructions to H.M. Ships regarding the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf provide that the Persian firman should not be acted upon for the time being in order to avoid drawing Persian attention to its existence. 5. The Admiralty therefore feel that it would be inadvisable to proceed with the proposal. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay at the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely. M.J. Clauson, Esq.

You will have seen that the Resident suggests, and the Government of India agree, that the Sultan of Muscat and the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait should cancel the existing proclamations which give Persian vessels rights of search outside Persian territorial waters.

Briefly, they are that so long as tne Arab principalities of the dulf do not themselves accede or authorise His Majesty’s government to accede on their behalf to an instrument such as tne Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and go long as their vessels fly a flag which is not the flag of a High Contracting Power, Iran appears to nave no legal rights of inspection of such vessels under the Convention! that it is possible tnat she may retain some rights of inspection under tne Brussels (Slavery) Act of 1880, though the India Office doubt this! and that she has (though she has shown no sign of realising this) under the Muscat Arms Proclamation of 1898, rights of search of Muscat vessels on the High Seas* 2# The Bahrain and Kuwait Proclamations of 30th April 1898 and 24th May 1900 respectively (vide my letter ho*34l-3, dated the 6th April 1933) accord to Persian vessels the right of search in respect of the vessels of the notifying Ruler in Persian waters, Indian waters and the Ruler's own waters, not on the High Seas. These Proclamations are not likely to cause any difficulty even if the Iranians realised that they possessed these rights. 3.
