Reference your confidential Printed letter No. Ill of iT&gt; 1941 dated the Ibth larch 1941. 2. I suggest that the following facts be taken into consideration when assessing the value of the report iade by the Head Hunshi of the Bahrain Agency. (a) ir. Satyajaurthi was, I believe, appointed Collector of Customs in Karachi about September last year so that since the outbreak of the *ar at least £ 7,200,000 in gold has been snuggled by H.I. steamers through the port of Karachi if we are to accept the weekly average of £ 150,000 which the Head wunshi. (b) Accepting the figure of £ 160,000, at least 0s 19,44,00 f 0&lt; taking the average value of a sovereign to have been fc 27/-, worth of sovereigns have been purchased in India between the brd September 1939 and Au ust 1940, apparently without affecting the goxd carnet or Cuasing any comment in financial •V- r papers. There wus a rise in the gold market ac the end of ieoruary but thus was not uue to internal buying. (c) The sovereign weighs lx/16 of a tola so that tne ini’ormant would have us believe that an average of 267b pounds weight, at 16 Oao to trie pound, of gold has been shipped weekly in the 3*1. steamers. Few people realise how heavy f'olii is. Bahrain does not consider to be an exaggeration.has imported some twenty-five packages comprising office fur niture and articles for household use. These are in addition to the weekly basket of fruit which is receivea through Abdul Munim .awawi. None of these articles have been unduly heavy. As far as I am aware the Karachi Customs Authorities have a right to search all packages exported to Muscat whoever they may be for ana that they exercise this right is clear from the fact that the basket of fruit is reported to be regularly opened each week by the Preventive Officers. That gold is being and has been smuggled out of India is true but not on the scale and by the route which the Head Munshiy Bahrain would have us believe Sd./ T. Hickinbotham.

Report Mo. 2. We have now been able to obtain more ample information regarding the smuggling of gold sovereigns. Our informant has approached A2DULLAH ZILHA, principal of the Bank Zilha (just returned from Lebanon) who gave him the following details. Incidentally, It may be mentioned that ZILHA has a wide knowledge and experience on this matter. He stated that it was an absolute fact that the drop, at the end of May 1940, of the Sterling gold sovereign, was due to the smuggling of this specie out of India. This smuggli; g was carried out in the following way: Gold sovereigns v/ere bought in Bombay (at the rate of about P.1*200 to the pound), secretly sent to Bahrain and from there to Iraq. After having left India, this move did not present any difficulty as there are no restrictions for the import of gold and gold sovereigns in Iraq. However, it is stated that some important people including even members of the Government of Iraq must have been connected with these operations. Statistics issued by the Irakian Customs show that 250,000 gold sovereigns were imported into Iraq in April and May last. From Iraq, this gold was sent to Syria. It may be of interest to note th a t in January 1940 the gold sovereign was Y/orth on the Egyptian market about P.T.210, in February, bankers coming from byria began to buy gold in Cairo arid made it rise gradually to P.T.440 (May 1940). This rise was said to be due to the smuggling of gold sovereigns to Syria and Lebanon where it v/as much in demand and attained at one moment the rate of P.T.650. From the last days in May 1940, the sovereign dropped again to about P.T.225. At present, there is some indicating pointing towards the revival of contraband of gold, as'the soverign in India is quoted at P.T.205, and in Egypt, today, at P.T.300 - in Lebanon and Syria, probably even more. According to ZILHA, this contraband will not be done on a large scale before the price in Syria of gold sovereigns reaches at least P.T.400. At that minimum price, all expenses are covered and an interesting profit is left to the smuggler. . rom a different source, it has be^-n said th^t the price of gold sovereign may rise in Egypt by the fact that after the occupation of Cyrenaica, the Arabs, who have been depossessed of their gold by the Italians, are now trying to obtain gold at any price, creating thus a large demand.;S«cret.

Political Agent Bahrain reports that between January 1st and February 8 th exports of gold from Bahrain to Iraq were as follows 19750 gold sovereigns 1000 oz. bar gold 50 Turkish liras, and states that sovereigns are smuggled into Bahrain in a steady stream from Saudi Arabia. According to information obtained in Bahrain 90 per cent of the sovereigns shipped to Iraq are being exported to Turkey and the balance to Syria. The Political Agent suggests that if the flow of gold to Turkey is considered detrimental to Imperial interests the export of gold from Bahrain to Iraq should be prohibited. 2.

The Political fgent stated that he wished to prevent gold leaving Bahrain for Iraq as there was likely to be a leakage to Turkey and thence to enemy occupied countries* 2. He considered that any action taken to prevent the export of gold from Arabia through Bahrain would tend to divert the export route from Bahrain to Kuwait because the route the gold was taking was Arabia to Iraq, via Bahrain or Kuwait, and thence to Turkey. 3. The Political fl gent foresaw that if the issue of export licences was curtailed there would be a great increase in the smuggling of gold and he invited the co-operation of the Bahrain Government in preventing this. He pointed out that there were adequate penalties under the law to penalise offenders. 4. The Adviser considered that no harm would be done to Bahrain interests by the prevention of this gold traffic; the only persons affected would be one or two bullion brokers who were Iraqi subjects. 5. tor. Gunn, Manager of the Eastern Bank, stated that the export of gold as such from Bahrain did not af act his bank. He was more interested in preventing the flow of rupee silver out of Bahrain. This was exported from Bahrain to pay for the gold finding ita way from 3audl Arnbia, into Iraq. Rupee notes not being accepted in Arabia large quanti ties o# rupee coin were being drained from Bahrain leavingrapt** notes. 6. The prevention of smuggling was next discussed. The problem was considered to be practically confined to preventing export to Kuwait py countrycraft, but to be peculiarly difficult owing to the physical features of the island of Bahrain. 7. The Director of Customs considered that one of the main difficulties in convicting smug :lers was the fact that smug lers could afford to pay large bribes to the customs guards whereas the rewards for obtaining convictions in the courts were inadequate. He argued t.iat the courts should, as a natter of practice, ordinarily award half the fine levied on convicted smug;lers as a reward to the per sons apprehending them. The Political Agent agreed to instruct the Agency courts, and the Adviser the Bahrain courts, accordingly. 8. Further practical measures were considered to be increased activity by the Bahrain police launch patrol round the coasts of the Island, and of the mounted police patrol on the north west shores of the island; coupled with arrangements with Kuwait for the search of ships on arrival from Bahrain. 9. The export of silver to Kuwait and Iraq was next con sidered. The Political Agent stated that he did not wish to prohibit the export entirely but to limit it to the amount required for the finance of bona fide trade only. Export of silver to Iraq was considered to be unnecessary. Iraq does not recognise rupee currency and trede transac tions can be paid for through the Eastern Bank. The con ference agreed that permission for the export of rupee silver to Iraq should not be given. The trade between Kuwait and Bahrain which required rupee silver currency was considered to be very small, and Mr. Bunn agreed to •.■1st the Agency In determining what epollc.tlona for rupee /-rupee currency for Kuweit were required for the finance of bona fide trade. 10* The Political Agent expressed his thanks to the con ference for their valuable assistance and the conference adjourned* Sumary of action agreed upon t- (1) Increased activity by Tlahrain Police patrols to prevent smuggling* (2) Half of fines inflicted on smugglers b* given as rewards to those bringing about their arrest* (3) Intimation of sailings of countrycraft to be sent to Kuwait for search on arrival. (4) Licences for export of silver to Iraq to be refused* (5) Applications for export licences for rupee silver to Kuwait €lleged to be for bona fide trade transactions will be referred to the Kastem Bank for opinion. oOo 3d/- H* Jackson 1/3/1942Confidential .

Arabia came originally from indie in the shape of remittances in gold made to the Saudi Arabian govern ment, It is also believed that large quantities bf gold ere being smuggled out of indie mostly from the Kathiawar coast. This smuggled gold probably reaches Iraq direct or via Kuwait and there appear« to be no good reason why it should travel via Saudi Arabia. 4* The rupee coins which leave Bahrain and Kuwait in such large quantities are it ie believed used for t)ie purchase of gold from Saudi Arabia, Tho situation is such in Kuwait tnat rupee notes are on).y accepted in the basaar at a discount of two annas in the rupee. The branch of the imperial Bank of Iran whieh has recently been established there but which has not yet been openedhas imported two lakhs of rapes coins# It is feared Vnat when the bonk opens this stoek of rupees will rep idly be exhausted and the oamc will be compelled to import more — a somewhat serious matter as freight charges eto. on a lakh of rupee coins amount to about *s* 3000/-• 5. It is difficult to understand what happens to all the rupee ooine which are sent to baud! Arabia* Their silver content is low and there can bs little temp tat i cm to hoard them* They are not legal tender in Iraq* and in Saudi Arabia there is a religious taboo based on some passage in the v uran, about which X hope to obtain mors p&amp;rtloul&amp;rs 9 against their exchange Into rials* This taboo doss not apply to sovereigns or Iraqi dinars# and when it is necessary to convert rupees into rials or vioe versa the exohangs is effected through one of these currencies* Over a hundred lorries recently arrived in Kuwait to fetch supplies lor Jeadah* The leader of the convoy brought a craft on a bank in Iraq for 7000 dinars and this was converted into rupees in the Kuwait bazaar* it seems unlikely that the rupee cor^s find their way back to India for the purchase of geld there as notes could bs much more conveniently used for this purpose. A certain number no doubt return to Bahrain and Kuwait to pay for conii'jod itles being exported to Saudi Arabia# but the fact remains that a larp.e proportion of the coins do not return unc there is therefore a constant demand for a supply of new rupee coins to replace them* 6. The action already token in Bahrain is explained in the first enclosure to tills letter, in Kuwait a proclamation has been published prohibiting participation in the smuggling of gold from India vide the fourth enclosure, an embargo on the export of gold from Kuwait would be ineffective owing to the impossibility of preventing such export by sea and land# and i am doubtful also whether on effective check could bs placed on the export of rupee eoins# even if the iihaikh were willing to prohibit euuh export* 7* 1 find it difficult to unoeretand the implications of these movements of gold and rupees and should be glad to know how• 3 - OoTemnent af India rim* than and whattier there U any further action ytiiioh they consider night he taken* 9* I mi forwarding a copy of this letter and its enclosures to the Seoretaxy of State for India, his Majesty's AKbasaador, daghcad.

Briefly it is:- Dinar notes arrive in Kuwait to buy gold from the Hedjaz and as the sellers of gold want silver the notes are sold for rupees. Buyers of dinar notes take them to Basrah and purchase bank drafts on Bombay and Karachi. Drafts are negotiated in Bahrain for rupees or rials which are represented as proceeds of sale of goods and export licence is obtained and rupees arrive in Kuwait and the circle conxnences again.

MEMORANDUM. 3 (N.B .—Fliis form is only to be used for correspondence of minor importance with subordi nate authorities.) From To No. Dated 10 Reference letter memorandurr No dated ' / i S. 153. MFP—1647 S&amp;P—(M-261,0)—30-5-40—100,000.I have made enquiries regarding the use of silver rupees imported from Bahrain and have so far obtained the following information: - The silver imported from Bahrain is not used for bona fide trade transactions as there is not much trade between Bahrain and Kuwait. Most of the merchants in Kuwait are dealing in different currencies available in Kuwait i.e. Iraq Dinars, Saudi Rials and Sovereigns. They purchase Iraq Dinars in Kuwait at a discount which varies almost every day and take them to Basrah from where they obtain bank drafts on Bombay or Karachi on payment of a nominal discount. These bank drafts are not sent to India because export of gold and silver is prohibited there but are sent to Bahrain from where the silver is imported into Kuwait. The Kuwait merchants are doing this exchange regularly and are making good profits out of it. The other use to which the silver imported into Kuwait is put is as under: Purchase of doId and Silver. Ever since the trade restrictions between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been removed large quantities of gold and silver are pouring into Kuwait from Saudi Arabia. In return of their gold and silver the Saudis take back with them rice, sugar, tea etc., and the balance in silver rupees which are again brought into Kuwait for further purchases. The gold thus imported into Kuwait finds its way to Iraq where the demand is ever increasing. The gold is purchased by the Iraqis either through there agents in Kuwait or is smuggled into Iraq. All the silver exported to Iraq from Bahrain is thus brought into Kuwait to pay for the cost of Sovereigns they purchase here. As the Iraqis do not possess enough silver rupees the remainder of the payments are made in Iraqi Dinars which are accepted in Kuwait only at a discount. The value of Iraq Dinars in Kuwait fluctuates with the rise and fall in the value of Sovereigns/Sovereigns. If the value of sovereigns go^up the value of Iraq Dinars go^down and vice versa. By this transaction a small eventually it is brought back into Kuwait. It was only in the second half of 1940 that large quantity , of silver rupees as well as Indian Currency Notes was exported to India in order to purchase Sovereigns from there. At that time the price of Sovereign in Kuwait went upto Rs.60/- whereas the price of in . . sovereign/India was only Rs.28/-. Most of the merchants in Kuwait closed their business here and collected all the possible silver rupees and notes which they took with them to India and brought back rather smuggled out of India large number of sovereigns. It was stopped only when a few of them were caught by the customs authorities in India and were duly punished. The chief use to which the silver rupees in Kuwait are put is hoarding. Before the outbreak of hostilities in September, 1939 the Indian Currency Notes and Iraq Dinars were accepted in Kuwait at par. Immediately after the war started the demand for silver rupees in Kuwait increased. This demand became more acute during 'the Iraq trouble when a 100 rupee note was sold in the market in return of 75 silver rupees and Iraq Dinar could be purchased for fe.7/8/- only. It is an open secret that there is more than enough silver in Kuwait which is lying underground. In conclusion I may add that the position re: silver rupees is now improving in Kuwait and I understand that the bank has more than one hundred customers who have deposited large sums of silver in the bank. percentage of silver rupees goes to Saudi Arabia and Iraq but.0.

Many thanks for your demi-official letter No.C/404-8A dated the 20th April 1942. 2. During the last six weeks I have Issued no permits for the export of silver to Kuwait, and I am glad to know that this strictness is, from what you say, fully justified. Now that the export of silver from Bahrain to Kuwait is restricted to the comparatively small amounts that can be smuggled through, new methods of r playing the money market* will certainly be devised by Kuwail and Basrawl and Bahraini merchants and brokers, and we shall have to be on the look out for their next move. Its an interesting kind of game that we play with these gentle men; their greater skill in pitying the game is balanced by the authority that we have to alter the rules! • 3.

The Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. New Delhi, the 15th April, 1942. Export of gold from India to the Near East . Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter No. C/140, dated the 15th March, 1942, and to say that the Government of India as at present advised do not consider that any special steps need be taken to stop the export of rupee coins from Bahrain and Kuwait andare prepared to meet all reasonable damands on the present scale for quaternary rupees, i.e., the new George VI rupees, which are required for shipment to the Persian Gulf. The question of freight charges must of course be considered by the Banks concerned as only consignments in replacement of withdrawn Queen Victoria rupees are sent at the cost of the Government of India. 2 . As regards the movement of gold, it seems impossible to stop the traffic entirely though much can be done to regulate and control it. Though there is undoubtedly a certain amount of gold being smuggled from India, the Government of India do not believe that the quantity is very great. Unless therefore there is evidence to show that the amounts being smuggled are on a much larger scale than the Government if India believe it is considered that the action already taken to check the smuggling of gold out of Bahrain and Kuwait is sufficient. As regards Saudi Arabia, the issue of licenses for the export of sovereigns from India is being restric ted to the minimum even when their value is paid in United States dollars, and as close a check as possible is being kept on illegal exports. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. * ' Sd/- H. Weightman. Joint Secretary to the Government of India. No. 425-S British Residency and Consulate General, Bushire.

Subject: Export - Restricted goods (Sovereigns etc.) - Seizures at Calicut and Palghat - Confiscation and Penalty. Read: The records of the case. • • • ORDER. The West Coast of the Madras Presidency and particularly the area North and South of Calicut is ideally suited to smug- gl: ■'g. There are rivers and deep indentations up and down the coait, while a good road runs along the coast not far from, the _ Villages and small towns are scattered here and there within easy reach of the sea 9 and there is ample cover of trees and jungle tb *oughout one area. The Malabar coast has an old historical connection ^ r ith the Persian Gulf and this connection w is exemplified by the extensive business in exporting local a produce to Arabian ports which is now carried on, based at/'the n port of Calicut. In addition to the legitimate trade in local produce, tamarind, wood, etc., the opportunities for contraband traffic provided by the geography of the coast have been utilised tor traffic in restricted or prohibited goods* since the out break of ^ar there has been reason so suspect a connection with che enemy, possibly an underground route by way of Iraq. 2. In ,the open season of 1941 towards the end of the sea son information began to con^ through to the Collector of Salt uevenue, Madras, on the smuggling of sovereigns and other goods from India via the West Coast. Action was taken during the closed season to strengthen the preventive work uf the Salt Department on that coast and the ^cope of the ^f^ ent ; S WOrk was greatly increased in the open season of 9x1-42. But effective control over the movement of craft on tiie coast after they had left port was not established since it was not possible to organise a sea patrol. Very little in- rormation was rece.v/ed during that season in respect of gold, ° /ip is possible that the course of the war and in particular one threat or invasion to India caused the falling off, which was apparent in contraband traffic, at least as much as the activities of the Sa*lt Department.3. The 1942-43 open season, however, began with informa tion from Bombay, the centre of trading in coin and bullion in India, that smugglers were again active, and that cors5.gn- ments were about to be run from the Calicut area. A telegram was received in Madras on January the 18th 1943 to the effect that an Arab had left Bombay for Calicut with 1500 sovereigns. A second telegram came on the 22nd January from the same source that an Arab named Raha4 had left Bombay for Calicut with 5000 sovereigns. The Arab mentioned in the first telegram was never traced: the second telegram, however, led to the arrest of 3 Arabs, Fahad A1 Angiri of Koweit, Abdulla Bin Abdul Hamid of Bahrein and Mohammed Bin Sulainan A1 Muttawa at Calicut station on the 22nd of January. These 3 men had in their possession nearly 3000 sovereigns, together with other goods for which they could not account in a satisfactory manner The full number of sovereigns mentioned in the information was not seized and a vigilant watch continued. On the next day, the iKxp&amp;xfexx Intelligence Inspector of the Madras Salt Depart ment arrived in Calic it: when he was informed of the seizure he stated that Arabs travelling on the train on which he had - travelled had been met and had left the train under suspicious circumstances at olavakoo. The Police at Palghat were there fore asked to erace these \rabs and to search then for sove reigns. Two of the 5, All spn of Benwan of Koweit and Lrha.m- ned son of f hmad A1 Bahar,. were arrested in the shop of C.A. Mohideen Kutti, tamarind merchant of Palghat: the other 3 had decamped, leaving their baggage in the shop. A seizure of over 3000 sovereigns and other goods was made from the person of the 2 arr 3 sted Arabs and the baggage of the 3 who had de- campedr, Vl/hlTe~ these cases were stiil under investigatioja^ further information was received from Bombay, which led to the arrest of a carrier, Damodar Joshi, at the house of Yusuf Sagar the leader of the Arab commercial community at Calicut, carry ing 1000 sovereigns and 20,000 rupees in cash, which appeared to be for export from Calicut. 4. A detailed investigation of the 3 seizures was made by the Madras C.I.D, xHd Special Branch and the Salt Department Intelligence Branch; after sometime it was decided th^t the seizures should be dealt with by the Collector of Salt Revenue under the Defence of India Rules read with the relative por tions of the Sea Customs Act. The Customs investigation was then entrusted to the Headquarters Assistant Collector of the Salt Department who held a detailed enquiry which was submitted to the Collector of Salt Revenue for orders. The persons wi.o are concerned in the case, Fahad A1 Angiri of Koweit, Abdulla son of Abdul w amid of Maharrak Bahrein, Mohammed Bin Sulainan A1 Mutta^w of Koweit, Ali son of Banwan of Kcweit, Mohamed son of Ahn c .u A1 Bahar of Koweit, Yusuf son of Sagar A1 \bdulla of n^xicut and his servant Mohamed Saleh Somali, Damodar L.Joshi^ of Bombay- C.A. Mohideen Kutty of Palghat and Khalid Bin Abdul Latiff of Bombay, were called upon to show cause against pen; 1 action, and their submissionshave been taken into account in drafting this order. 5. The offence of which these persons are accused is that of carrying jut a series of actions preparatory to the axport of the gold, sovereigns and other goods seized, without the permission of the Export Trade Controller or of the Reserve Bank of India as the case may be, punishable under the Defence of India Rules 84 or 90'-B, read with 121 , as applying the penal section of the Sea Customs Act which deals with the export of prohibited and restricted goods. The punishment is confiscation of the goods together with penalties on the per sons who are concerned in the offence which may extend to 3 times the value of the goods. It is to be noted that under the Defence^of India Rules, It is an offence to carry outactions preparatory to the commission of an offence or to corm±ssl(: &gt; n of an offence. It is to be noted, also* that the case against these persons is dealt with on the b^Ss that the seizures are all aspects of an organised conspiracy to smuggle, and not isolated casesr - - 7 6 . Tne Department, in order to secure a successful case, must show, therefore, that the goods were for export, espe cially, since the seizrres were made at Calicut station/ in the one case' tr.i in a house at Balghat, in the second case, Calicut, in the third case, and not either in the shore or during the actual process of exporting the goods. It must be shown that the activities of the accused logically lead up to the performance of the intended act - export - and that whatever contention is made in defence of those activities is not the correct explanation of them. 7. In respect of the -intention to export, there is a considerable volume of information available with the Depart- spare from cho evidence which actually transpired during the Headquarters .Assistant Collector's enquiry. The encuiry itself confirmed oeyond doubt the information which was'in the Departments nands: actual cases have occurred again of he smuggling of ^overeig s from Karachi and other '/Vest Coast T .re is- io nor max movement of sovereigns to Calicut, and there is no'sovereign market in Calicut which could at any time of the year readily absorb the large sums which were carried by he accused in these cases. It is obvious, in fact, from the.method jy which the sovereigns were purchased in Bombay, and from the means of carrying them to the West Coast which were .employed, and from the fact that all the accused de- +^4 v' e P oss ® ssion o£ tbte sovereigns on their person or in their baggage wnen first questioned, that they not only were not passing by normal trade channels but that they were not i itendea to do so,^ There is a considerable profit to be made in the transportation of gold to Arabian ports; the method cf transporr used keeps expenses to a. minimum, and so enhances tne profit. The general inference undoubtedly is that there did exist a smuggling traffic in sovereigns from the port of 0n general grounds there is no reason to believe that this gold was being carried to the West Coast for any r legitimate : -purposev-:/;The-infereheg thai^ this gold w* s intended for smuggling is one which cannot bd avoided, h . f. : : *&gt;.'■' : '' o’ - take the argument a step further, the actions of tne accused in the present case show a remarkable similarity in type, so far as the carriers are concerned. They handled considorabie credits, not only.in the ordinary way of business, but to an exoant wnich could not be explained fully by their or mary trade purposes. They^ purchased a considerable number . b ?Y® r61 |^ s Bombay through brokers, whom they could not ia ? n Iu^ ^tterwards, at prices abovfe the ordinary market price, and they had no connection with a normal market for bullion n embay, or in Calicut, Nevertheless, none Q.f them made any attempt to secure a valid permit to export the seve- . The me f n f ■ of carrying, as has already been remarked, i dicate surreptitious disposal. Further-more, when Yusuf agar and Somali, to say nothing of the; shop keeper Mohideen utti, cone into the picture, telegrams ; which were issued after in e rf^o^- ar h 0S ^ ind:lcate Glearl y th ^ t there was ^organisation m Calicut v/hicn was concerned in the disposal of these seve- h e , lg ? S -ai^ ere is nc organisation which could or had handled so many sovereigns: the inference is obvious, that the organisation was concerned with an illicit traffic. Not ^ e - L ®S r ams; sent to stop further movements of sove reigns; but also a frantic attempt was made by Yusuf Sager 1 s servant Somali not only to stop the second party from coming-4- S &gt;V&gt; 3m to Calicut,^but also to secure their release after their arrestt” while the disappearance of 3 of the 5 men who formed that party, and their abandonment of goods worth thousands of rupees in itself point to no legitimate intention in respect oi the goods. ,^• ^t the enquiry it transpired that the defence was that all the persons concerned were engaged in normal business; they purchased sovereigns in Bombay for the purchase of goods m Cglicut fo: legitimate export. This would be in any case an unusua. method of financing the export of goods from Calicut; but this point is met by the defence suggestion that there was a profit to he made on the sale of the sovereigns in Calicut, as against the price at Bombay. But there is no trace whatever °x transactions m sovereigns on a large^tn’ Calicut as a means oi xinanemg the export of goods from that port, and there is no evidence that any such transactions had been arranged'in t-is case. There is, again, no market in Calicut which ^rould a I e ^u andl ? d 30 nany soverei gns without a control f-om Bombay; an there is nothing suggest that Bombay gold merchants wouic. ^ allow profits to be made in Calicut by persons traffic king m sovereigns outside the controlling ring. The whole story Ox a^normal method of financing export trade by purchas ing sovereigns surreptitic sly at Bombay, and selling also surreptitiously at Calicut is nonsense. The legitimate infe- rence from the carriage of these sovereigns from Bombay to ancut is that they werc intended for export, and that since was m ad3 to obtain a permit to export them, for illicit export. The same consideration applies with greater xorce to the other goods which were seized. 1C. The general conclusion is thus that the sovefeT'^hs, golu and c ;her goods were intended for illicit export from the west Coast, and that they were carried in the way' in which they were carried up to the point at which they were seized' as part ? ^ries of actions i n ’t e nded to end in the export of the goods from India without proper permission. . . , n - ncw turn to the connection of the various indi viduals with the offence. In the first seizure made at Calicut railway station, 3 carriers, and indirectly Somali and Yusuf T- a fxy, ? ar f im P--icated. in the second seizure, made in Hbhideen | al ; p alghat 2 carriers are implicated, 3 carriers S ° n e • ^ eavln 3 rheir goods, while assistance was given to tne carriers not only kh by the merchant MChideen Kutti, bu' ? h0wn la ' er ^t.y Somali and hisu:’ Sagar. The seized ot ; - ad6 in Yusuf Sagar ‘ s house and pacers s^izea at that^time bring m evidence to 'show that Yusuf Sanar 'Iso^ndhh rh th the ,° ffcnce in respect of these sovereigns ^' ’ 1. he 13 the pn?ncipal in the smuggling, in direct Latiff 1 Wlth on0 of lhG bonba y principals, Khalid /Ibdul Yhe modus operand! of the smuggling, as ahown by the enquiry, is that the Arab merchants and carriers come to^British on'c?ed?f ~ engage y s Sitimate business in Karachi and Bombay on credits arranged from Kovait, Basra, Aden etc. They meet 7 ?nR^w iPa i S in u b( iu h J he le g iti!a Q b e trade and the smu-^ling in Bombay, since both the forms of business are closely^inter- onnected; ^pu.'chases of goods are arranged and the trade ^oods r ShippeQ u , aCi&lt;: to Persian Gulp ports, while the agents them- selves purchase, ciarry and export on their own persons or on . e persons of other agents for whom arrangements are made at out c sy raband goods which it is designed to take out of India. This case goes to show that the leader of the organisation xor shipping both legitimate goods and contraband} fv » 4.J •5- goods at Calicut is Yusuf Sagarv He has lived for many years in Calicut, is a man of wealth and position and has a flourish ing business: he ( ts recognised by Arabs who come to Calicut on any account as a leader of their community there, and his inti mate connection with the export trade makes it easy for him to have goods taken to places on the coast out of the reach of the Customs authorities, and..to arrange for them and for the .carriers to be placed on boats which had le f ft Calicut with no contraband on board, with the apparent intention to proceed direct to Koweit or whatever the port of destination might be. The actual route followed by carriers from Bombay, after they have purchased the sovereigns, is the normal railway route via Madras or Arkonam, attd it appears that they normaliy pro- ceed to the ’each Hotel at Calicut or to oth c r rest houses and that they eventually make their way to Yusuf Cagar : s' ovn house, final instructions are given there, the contraband is handed over to other carriers, if necessary, a~'d an arrangement is made with the tindal of the vessel which is to take on the ^ as bec.i indicated, owing to the activity of the Customs staff, smuggling normally takes place ab conve- nient spots North ana South of the port, and not usually in Calicut^port itself. In other words, this enquiry has uncovered a conspiracy to smuggle, the existence of which has been sus pected for some time; a conspiracy which is a danger nc t only to the economic life of tf ; country, but is calculated, in time o± war, to endanger security also. 13. On the conclusion of the enquiry the persons who shown to be concerned in their various degrees in the oifence of smuggling were called upon to show cause against penal action. In the case of the 3 Arabs arrested at Calicut, - t] ? e 2 ' Tabs arrested at Palghat, the offence was taken to Tracts preparatory to the export of certain goods in con travention of Defence of India Rules 90-3 (2) and (3), L nd 84, as further defined in Defence of India Pule 121, punishable unaer Sea Customs Act Section 167 /3), read with Section'l9. ie Case ^ Mohideen Kutti, Yusuf Sag^r and Somali the • M n uL Was abettin g tIa e actions of the carriers of the goods: in &gt;ohideen mtti-s case in respect of those which were seized iron All son of Ahm&amp;fcftxxlyhxE Benwan of Koweit, from Mohamed ' '-Sor 1 -Q-i ■ A1 Bahar, in Mohideen 5 s shop and frora the baggage of the -3 Arabs who decamped; in the case of Yusuf Sagar and^ Somali their connection is with all the accused.

Yusuf Sagar denies complicity in the breach of the law, and denies knowledge of Jcshi or of the goods brought by him, Ke alludes to his long career in Calicut, to his posi tion there and to the g'vfts he had made to war funds. The whole case against him is that he has utilised a legitimate position of power, influence and wealth in business to cover an underground traffic of which these seizures are the result. There is no reason to doubt, again, his contact with any of these cases, apart from the seizure of lOOo sovereigns and 20,000 rupees actually made in his house. Requests were made by Mohideen Kutti, Spmali and Yusuf Sajsar for copies of state ments etc. to be furnished to them to enable them to make a fuller defence; but afcer the enquiry h Id by the Headquarters Assistant Collector none of them could have had any doubt as to the nature of their offence or of the proceedings against them. Their request ippeared to me to be merely a device to , prolong the proceedings and to obscure the issue and I did not, therefore, accede to it. An attempt was also made to induce me to hear counsel in the case, which I refused to do, on the ground that no useful purp )se would he served by such &amp; conces sion. 15. Fahad A1 Angiri arrested at Calicut had with him 94 sovereigns, 10 gold bangles, 4 gold buttons, 96 piston and oil rings for Ford cars and 46 tins of saccharine. His explanation as to why he brought the sovereigns tu Calicut has been analysed. that he bxought the piston rings from an unkown man —* who brought them to him at a restf/^ant and that he purchased ' ' the sovereigns through a broker. He had no receipts for any cf^the purchases, and did not kno^ T the - prices of' the - vario^us articles in the Calicut market. V/hen questioned by the Police after his arrest, he denied that he had any sovereigns with him; again, he ^ stated that the jewellery and the saccharine were for distribution to friends; but he also stated that it was his first visit to Calicut. His hfriends obviously, therefore, if he had any, were not in Calicut. 16. Abdulla Bin Abdul Lamid had with him 1146 sovereigns which ne stated ne purchased through a broker at Bombay. It was his firs,t trip to Calicut; he did not know any one at Cali cut and had made no enquiry as to the price of sovereigns there. ^ he appears to have purchased sovereigns in Bombay at 3 annas per sovereign over the normal price including commission. / 17• Hohammed Bin Suleman had with him 1695 sovereigns, 3 gold necklaces, 10 gold bangles and 12 gold rings. He, again, stateu that it was his first visit tc n alicut; that he had made nr ? bo ? t ^ P rice of sover eigns at Calicut and knew nj one at Calicut. He^had paid approximately 10 annas over the normal price of sovereigns in Bombay, and neither he nor Hamid appears to have obtained any permission from the ostensible ° f JJ he m ?^ ey vrhich ^ey were ising, to gamble in sove- igns. These three persons thus hand]°d considerable sums of abo ye be regarded as necessary for their normal tra^e; carried a.arg same Ln -overeignsfor no apparent reason to Calicut, had no connection with any normal market in al^cut for sovereigns;'had no pern.r to export sovereigns or otheijgoods, and, from the telegrams wiich were sent out after their arrest (despite their donial th t they knew any one in W \ r u ! ctually met b y a relative of. Yusuf Sagar** at the station) had connections in Calicut which they wished to keep concealed. y IS.-7- V i':. tv, Jll W ; 1 Ali ? on of Benwan, arrested at Palghat, had ^vith him ? 1^00 sovereigns and 2 white pearls. He had a through ticket from Bombay to Calicut, and stated that he broke journey at ulavakot to go to Palghat to meet Mohideen to purchase tamarind: lu n0 ^ k een to Palghat or met Mohideen before. He stated .. T , ne mee t any Arabs at Olavakot, that he did not meet Mohideen or Somali at Olavakot; that he engaged a bandy and ?^ cne Palghat, and that he met Mohammed son of Ahmad A 1 Bahar on the way. He had a telegram sent from Pal,chat to Bombayx addressed to Zaban care of Marzook (the address of one ° f /u 6 , princip ? 1 Arab financiers in Bombay) M Don't sat start’* ana had no valid explanation as to why he sent the telegram, he saw no tamarind samples and made no enquiries as to prices u # men 9 uestion ed by the Police he did not admit that he had sovereigns. He had made no enquiries about the price of sovereigns at Calicut, nnd said that he had not pre viously arranged the purchase of goods by buying sovereigns. his account of his stopping his journey at Olavakot not only contraaicts thp accounts of Somali and Mohideen but also sug gests obviously that an attempt was made both to stou him from going to Calicut after the first arrests, and also to conceal, alter the second arrests, the connection of Yusuf 3ag*r and his servant with the smugglers. IP* Shammed son of . imed A1 Bahar had 1005 sovereigns with him. He also stated that although he had a through''ticket to OaJ-lcut he stopped on route to dispose of the sovereigns at Palghat for the purchase of tamarind. He stated that he did u k tc \ the other 3 Arabs who alighted from the train and that he went straight to Mohideen’s house in a jutka. He saw no Samples of tamarind at Palghat and made no enquiries about its price. Correspondence seized from his person suggests clearly that he was connected with the purchase of sovereigns owned by Abdul Mohsin A1 Falah A1 Kharafi. The points which ave a ready been noted in respect of the first three Arabs Galicut a re Present in respect of these two cases, -onammea is a man of some substance who evidently traffics in sovereign in addition to his dealings in normal exports. A 20 ./the unclaimed goods at Palghat contist of 1120 sove- f° ld n rA k h ce ’ t sold ban g les &gt; 2 eold anklets, 7 rolls of chk Pf, i saccharine, 1 Q 2 Kodak films, 27 rolls of silk, 2 yaras of shirting and 2 silver v&gt;histles. A ^^'/®^ 0 u s and sovereigns and 20,000 rupees in each were ® Dar '^dar Jcshi at Yusuf Sagar'e house.

He was to be paid 500 runees for the work and his Second Class fare and expenses. ^ Yu suf Sagar»s part in the general conspiracy, however, is seen more clearly after we analyse the movements and corres- ° f h ls servant Somali. In the first instance, Somali and hi 0 ”'’ th ?- h ® ffu in Cal * cut January the 22 nd, and that his meeting with the Arabs «t Palghat was accidental. He states that he and Mohideen found the 5 Arabs on the station- 8 - platform, and that the whole party was invited to Palghato^ This does not coincide with the story told by the Arabs.^ He also states that the Arabs were shown samples of tamarindj but they stated that they saw no samples of tamarind. Somali’s own bock of account shows that he went to Palghat^in ^great haste from Calicut* that he telegraphed to Yusuf Sagar from Palghat after the arrests ? and that he kept an account of money obtained by him through Mohideen, in order to obtain bail for the arrested Arabs. On the night of January the 24th-25th, he returned to Calicut by car, obviously for further consulta tion with his master, returning to Palghat by kkx bus. 23. Thus, it has been seen that a relation of Yusuf Sagar net the first 3 Arabs at Calicut station: from documents seized and enquir/ e Sade it is shown that a telegram was sent from Yusuf Sagar’s house to Bombay immediately after their arrest to the Bombay firm of Ali Hanood Shaya (of which the short address is Marzook), an Arab firm which has been handling the finances of many of these Arabs who are accused of smuggling. The next day, another telegram was sent to Bombay, a^^in, from Yusuf Sagar's house, to try and stop Mohammed son of Ahmed Al- Bahar, the second accused of the Palghat seizure, from starting from Bombay. It is obvious that Yusuf Sagar knew the first party and**knew that another party was on the way to Calicut, and that he wished to stc them. Somali was sent by the Malabar Express to Olavakot immediately after the first arrests to make sure that the second party were stopped before they got to Calicut. Somali : s own diary proves that in actual fact he did go to Palghat on the 22nd; his meeting with the Arabs there and his subsequent movements have been dealt with. 24. He ^nd his master were obviously deeply implicated in the snuggling. After the arrest of the Arabs at Palghat, Somali sent a telegram to Yusuf Sagar and asked for help. He received no reply and went to Calicut the next night by taxi, a journey substantiated by the car owner and the driver, and by entries in Somali’s diary. Somali again went to Palghat by bus on the 27th, and tried to get bail for the Arabs. It is impossible that Somali v;ould have expended so much money, and made so many journeys without instructions from his master. i / 25. There rema boured the 5 Arabs nection with Somali is no doubt that he divert them from go what happened, his and that which is g not the truth.

There is no doubt of his con- , and 5 through him, with Yusuf Sagar# There met the 5 Xrabs at Olavakot in order to ing on to Calicut; the discrepancies between story of the meeting and subsequent events ^ven by the Arabs show that his story is also telegraphed to Bombay on behalf of one alghat to the a-ddress 'Marzook', and drafted Sagar “&gt;n behalf of Somali. He also arranged Palghat, in order to obtain bail for the 26. There are recorded instances of the smuggling of sove reigns and other goods from the West Coast of India to Persian Gulf ports. The seizures which are the subject of this order were made in circumstances wnich, after full investigation, point to the inevitable conclusion that these sovereigns and goods were intended for illici'. export out of India. The in vestigation indicates, in fact, that there existed a regular organisation at Calicut which under cover of a flourishing legi timate trade, carried on illicit exports of sovereigns, gold,' saccharine and other goods.. 27. The detailed evidence which has been briefly reviewed shows that Fahad, Hamid, Suleman, Ali, Mohammed and Damodar Joshi were carriers, playing a limited but important part in the-9- transport of the sovereigns from India, although one or tv/o of them are men of some substance who handle considerable suns of money. Mohideen is one of Yusuf Sagar f s business connections on the coast, and so was utilised for the important p»rt of stopping the second party after the first were arrested. He enabled 3 carriers to escape, and it was no fault of his that the remaining 2 who were arrested at Palghat did not escape also. He is a well-to-do merchant with considerable business interests t at Palghat. Somali is the servant and intimate associate of Yusuf Sagar both in his legitimate business and in his smuggling activities. He acted as an energetic go-between in the attempt to stop the second party, and to release those of them who were arrested after the arrest of the first party. He is culpable to a high^ degree; but his part is generally subordinate. Yusuf Sagar is the head of the whole organisation at Calicut; he has wealth and position; he has a faithful servant who is willing to do any work, legitimate or otherwise, given to him by his master; he is the person to whom the smugglers go eventually in Calicut; he is the person to whom everyone turns for ins tructions when the Customs aftd Police intervene; and there is no doubt that Somali's frantic attempts to stave off the arrest of the seepnd party of smugglers at Palghat were carried out under his orders. It is with him that the principal in Bombay corresponds, and it was to him that the carrier from Bombay went with 1000 sovereigns. There is no doubt as to his princi pal position in the organisation. ^28. Khalid, the Bombay principal left India before the enquiry was completed. His legal representatives deny that he owns or has any connection with the 1000 sovereigns carried by Joshi: apparently, no-one owns them. But it is unlikely that they were the property of Joshi, who himself stated that Khalid was his principal. There is no doubt of their destination. The legal representatives »lso state that the 20,000 rupees v/ere sent to Calicut as a loan to Ahmed ’A1 Musad. But this person is tindal of a vessel, one of the craft that is used in the traffic which is the subject of this order. There is no evidence that he had any legitimate use for the money in Cali cut, and the conclusion is fckxt inevitable that it was to be taken out of India in contravention of the Reserve Bank Noti fication on the export of funds. 29. The explanations giben by all these persons of their activities do not fit in with the known KXHdiJtiHK conduct of trade c.n the West Coast: they do not provide a plausible explanation of their activities, or of their being where they were, with the goods which they carried, in the case of the carriers, at the time of their arrest; their statements at the enquiry do not tally with known facts or with facts elicited from the seized correspondence and diaries. No conclusion is possible but that the goods seized were being carried to Calicut for the express purpose of clandestine export, without the permit necessitated by the war-time law of India, and in defiance of the authorities who are responsible for the observance of that This concruslon indicates the grave offence defined In para 5 of this order, of which I find the parties guilty: an offence, which merits condign punishment.

On board ih« Boon Towfiq, search parties found a.fU.ee conpartaent which contained packets of soTereigpe under the seat of a chair which is invariably used by the Nakoda. Hothing acre vaa found on the 6th; guards vers kept all night and the searches continued on the 7th. One of the officers on the Boom Towfiq tapped a thick-pipoe of timber which formed part of the hatch coaming and sounded hollow* This pises was prised up and compartEsenta were found hollowed on • the un der aide. Packets containing sovereigns were found in these compart^enta, and over these a thin plank had been nailed to prevent them falling out. This gave a direct olus which was rollowd up on the other vessels. On the.Boom Tariff, a minute examination of the store-room floor revealed another loose plank whioh was prised up and under it sovereigns were found oonosalsd in tha ease manner-as those found on this vessel on the previous day. 4. The hatch coaming of tha Musaffa was slightly differ* ently cassis constructed to those on the other vessels. This vessel was the largest of the five. The hatches xh had solid timber all round with extra tapered pieces at the fore and after end of the hatches. These pieces had been so well placed that they gave an tanre4.iion of not having been moved from • the time the craft had been built. Although tapping did not f ive any indication that any of these timbers were hollow' t was decided to have them removed. This proved to be a difficult measure as the nails wars about a foot long. After removing the upper pieces, the lower shut timbers which were thick cross•beams were found to have a coating of cement and when this was chipped awat, packets of sovereigas were found embedded in sand in excavations specially out in the lower timbers. Nothing objectionable w&amp;s found, on the Maimoon* 6. Bagla R&amp;xdan was thoroughly searched. Several of the deck planks of the store-room were ripped open and a secret compartaant between two bulkheads was exposed. Restricted merchandise such as cotton piece-goods.etc. was found in these compartments.- The hatch coaezng was K lifted and ell likely places of concealment were thoroughly examined. Removal of some of the dock planks revealed cavities out in the cross beams of the deck, but these were empty. One revolver and sixteen rounds of acmunition were found in the Bagla's life boat which was tied up alongside the veaeel. One gold brooof. was found on this vessel. Heedless to say that a good deal of damage was done to ail these vessels whioh would not ordinarily have been caused, had the information been not so specific or ampha- tie. dies. for. It is also possible that if no aovoroigis had bean : discovered our staff may have had a good deal to answer 7. All eovereigse found were pecked in similar packets, 60 sank each sawn in cloth and then inserted in rubber of about ballons. 3orae of the packets were found to contain acid i ewellery.

The Assistant Collector, kept in constant touch eith everything and remained in contact with the source of his information and the search was given up only when it was thought that no twtax further headway was possible. The identical mariner in which all the icvereigis were packed and the similarity of the hiding places on board indicated that these sovereigns were smuggled according to a well concerted plan and a clue to this was obtained on board the Boom Tariff. While the staff was searohing the vessel a Koweitee Arab seaman came on board. He was challeng ed and searched, but nothing was found on hie person. He was then made to squat on his haunches ond prodded in the stomach. The result was that one packet containing 50 sovereigns which had been concealed in his rectum dropped on the deck, thus suggesting the method of concealed transport into the docks that had been so successfully employed on this and presumably previous occasions. 6. The Makodas of the vessels on which these sovereigns were discovered are unanimous in affirming their icnorance of the whole affair. They assert that they have a^rtments in the town and whilst in port they spend most of their time .shore, but whether all the nugt smuggling of sovereigns on kheir vessel is done without their knowledge is another matter, inquiries are being made as to the financiers behind this racket as from several intercepts recently forwarded to us by the Censor, it is clear that large quantities of sovereigns have been sent by the Arab Country Craft, and wakodas are being paid ik. 1/8/- to %• 2/- per sovereign as freight, but there is such a complete reticence being maintained in Arab circles, that news is extremely diffi cult to obtain.

The pasibility of gold smuggling from Bombay had for some time been the subject of xmxmi review by the Intelligence Branch oi this Custom House. In the beginning of January statistics of sovereign sales compiled from the daily statements of the Reserve Bank disclosed a nk* substantial ££»« in the quantities disposed of in November/Deeember 1943. The figures were i- JttlT August September October November December 1943. n Sovereigns 9,377. 11,014 6,469 400 25,975 81,887. gold The oausss of this inorsase wars invsstigatsd to deter mine how far at might relate to illicit exports. Th selling price of sovereigns in Persian Gulf ports was reported to be high enough to leave a gross margin of Ra. 10/- per sovereign. The number of Koweit Arabs present in Bombay for business purposes was known to be fairly large as exhort quotas were not available to them it seemed if possible that they might divert their efforts to other channels of trading. In this eonnsotion it was known that many Arab bfglae vlsilvd Bombay carrying no ostensible oar* either on the inward or outward journey. It had been suape for some time that smuggled gold was passing out of the /country The Icountry through two outlets namely Jamnagar where the staff of the Roveit Shipping Jgency was {fill active and ttarmagoa where certain Arab craft were reported to be lying. The Collector of Central within whose juridsiction these two ports are situated was apprised of these suspicions* All suspected Arab dhows were . extensively xaa rummaged before they left Bombay* From mk* what is known now it tieems likely that sovereigns were concealed in thos* vessels but their clever conceal ment baffled the efforts of the search parties. The only concrete result of these raids was the seizure of quantities of restricted merchandise. Towards the end of March two gold seizures wore made from Arab seamen who were searched by the h guards posted at the Northern Bunders. In each case one packet containing 50 sovereigns was found* Tills was. the first definite gswid prodf that smuggling was t aking place through the port* 5.

From enquiries made through informers and from intercepts it seems that the Naxodas of Arba vessels were charging from Rs. 1-3-0 to Rs*2/- per sovereign as freight* It is stated that the inability of Arab traders to obtain permission to export normal trade goods was one of the roasons which compelled them to resort to the* smuggling of sovereigns. On 5-4-1944 i.a. the day before the first • seizure the rate prevailing in Bombay was Rs. 51-6-0 and in Basrah Rs* 61-6-0 per sovereign which left the smugglers a net profit ©f ha. 6-4-0 to Ea.7-4-0 after deductions •. for freight, brokerage etc., 6* From intercepted letters end reports from the Intelligence Branch of this Custom House, the following are suspected to bo the chief persons behind the attempts at organised smuggling from this port* 1* Ali Eamaod 3 nay a and his son Baleh All iiamood hhaya of Koweit who nave an office in 178, Nagdevi Street, Bombay* 2* Abdul Vahab £ssa A1 Kotami of Koweiti Has left India for Koweit about tho beginning of this month. * 3.

The question of confiscating the vessels also was considered but it was decided not to proceed with such action. In this particular case it was not considered that legal action could be taken against the Nakhodas but this does not mean that it will not be possible in future to take legal action against vessels and owners in similar cases where better evidence is forthcoming. — Subject : Smuggling - Seizure of 28.000 sovereigns.

By that time the boats in question had already arrived here and discharged. It was not therefore possible to search them. 2. The addressee of the intercept denied all knowledge of transactions in gold or thct^he had had any instructions to collect fees for its transport. As the intercept was delivered to the Reserve BanK and not to the addressee this is not surprising. 3. Eis Highness the ShaiKh of Kuwait did not therefore consider that they had sufficient evidence to prosecute the addressee. » 4. ?'ore recently, however, Fahad Khalifah Bhaheen Al-Chanlm, the writer of the intercept, returned to Kuwait i.ronL Bombay; and, as a result of political pressure put upon His Highness the Shaikh, he was fined u*. 1,000/-. I would remark, however, that, if he oomultted any crime, he committed it in India against Indianegulations You who are charged with enforcing these regulations had evidence of his contravening them, yet you appear to have done nothing to prosecute the offender or to^prevent his contravening the regulations in future. Instead,you appear to expect His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait to do your' work for you. I must therefore stress that in future I shall not consider myself justified in pressing His Highness the Shaikh to take action in cases in which such action should so clearly be taken by you.

Please refer to your official letter No.C.794- . I am afraid that the purpart of the action of this Custom House in sending you two reports under letters Nos. 1.3.14/44 dated 24.4.44 and 29.4.44 seems to have been somewhat misunderstood. These reports were sent for information and any measures you thought advisable to adopt at your end for the prevention of gold smuggling.lt was never the intention that any / - ork ' T hich comes legitimately within the sphere of the activities of this Custom House should be undertaken either by you or His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. Nor was there any suggestion that political pressure should be brought to bear on His Highness.V’e felt that the reports which were received by us from Bombay might be of interest to you. It was ofcourse left to you to consider what action was the most advisable if the country craft concerned and the suspects arrived at Kuwait. I may further explain that, as a matter of fact, the sovereigns were not exported from this port nor did the vessels sail from Karachi. Consequently, this department had no opportunity to intercept the vessels or the goods or take any action against the persons concerned. I appreciate the action ultimately taken at your end, I am writing this to make the Position of this Custom House clear and with a view to better understanding.

On 2.3.1945 late at night information was received by an Intelligence Officer that a quantity of sovereigns was concealed on an Arab vessel lying in the Anchorage Lines, and the informant urged instant'action as he stated that the place of Concealment was only temporary and the sovereigns might be removed at any time. The Special Bivision Inspector and search party located the vessel Boom Fathe 1 Rehman, Nakhoda liohomed Nassar at about 1 A.M. and carried out a search The place where the sovereigns were stated to be concealed by the informant was located after a considerable amount of difficulty, this was an extention of the strengthening piece to the cross beam below the main deck and fixed to the side of the vessel. On prising this extra bit away a cavity covered with a plant of wood and which contained the sovereigns was discovered in the inner surface of this piece. Packets, covered over with cloth and sewn and then recovered with rubber balloons, containing an average of about 50 sovereigns each were discovered in the cavity.

The staff after groping in the water under the fittings surrounding the lower extrenities of the main mast and the smaller mast in the stern discovered packets of sovereigns done up in smaller coverings as those found earlier. The cloth coverings on the packets indicated that they had been in the water for a considerable time and were mostly in a deteriorated condition. Guards were kept on the vessel and the masts were unshipped and the search continued for two days. All the bilges were drained and the filth at the bottom sifted for loose sovereigns. Sovereigns were also found in the middle of a bundle of dates which was in the Store room of the vessel. 8,329 sovereigns were found on this search bringing the total of sovereigns found on this vessel up to 11,989 valued at Ks 5,93,455/-.
