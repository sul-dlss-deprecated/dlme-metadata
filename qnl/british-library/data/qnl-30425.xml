Limit for Persian territorial Waters*T. 11524/11524/380 Sir, 10th Januery, 1934* I am directed by Secretary Sifcr John Simon to request you to inform Secretartj Sir Samuel Hoare that he has Jut had under consideration a statement contained in paragraph 7 of Mr* Mallet’s telegram Mo. 265 of the 15th October , a ciopy of which is enclosed, to the effect that the Persian Minister for For eign Affairs recently claimed a ten-mile limit for Persain terr itorial waters. 2* As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, there is no international agreement laying down t .e limit of territorial waters for all countries* His Uajesty&amp;s Government in the United Kingdom claim three m^iles only, but Persia is by no means alone in claiming more; indeed at the Conference for^he Codification of International Law held at the Hague in 1930, while most of the i important maritime states claimed no more tiK^gJ three miles, tney in a minority. At that Conference, it may be recalled, t e Persain representatives claimed a limit of six miles ££** plus an adjacent zone, the breadth of which does not appear to have b( been specified. Although the Persian representative did not himself give any explanation of the prupose for which this adjacent zone was claimed by his g vernment , the majority of other States which put forward a similar claim on this occasio* made it clear that they required the adjacent zone partly at least for purposes of customs control* The Under Secretary fif State, V India Office*■■■■■■ 'V © . * 2 i . 3« The ten mile limit recently claimed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first sight to be - incompatible with the claimrnade in 1930 by the Persian representative at the Conference, but it may well be that Kazemi had in mind the adjacent zone when mentioning the higher figure* Whatever may be theprecise wxtent of the Persia* n claim , it is evident that if ti includes an adjacent zone it cannot be far short of the ten-mile limit. 4. In t he absence of any international agreement, it ia, in Sir John Simon's view, impossible to base a refusal to accept the I ersian ^overnmentts claim to a ten-mile limit upon the international position • Not would it appear disirable to base such a refusal upon tkefact that the Persian claim at the 1930 conference was not to a ten mile limit, since to do so muoi would go near to bring an acceptance of the claim to a six mile limit and an adjacent zone, which would be contrarey to the gjuo gpunc general policy of His Maj estyle Government in t e United Kn Kingdom on the subject, In these circumstances, it cannot be expected that the Persian Government will admit the justice o; of any complaints regarding interference with shipping by the ■'Persian coast, in cases where it would be a sound defence &gt; that the action was taken within the limits of (ersian territor ial waters » It appears therefoe to Sie John Simon that 9 while protests should in such cases continue to be made in order to safeguard the principle of a three mile limit, His Wajesty’s Government hawe no means of enforcing their view* 5./- mm k • i t - /“V 5. Subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare Sir John Simon proposes to inform His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran of/the position as set forth above for his guidance , and he suggests that it may be desirable that the Political Resident in the Peripn Uulf should take steps to warn the masters of vessels from the Arab States ofthe Persian Gulf in sxt suitable terms of the practical effects of the Persian claim to ten-mile limit of territorial waters# 6# Asimilar letter is beirg sent to theAdmiralty# I am, sir 9 four obediei tservant f Sd# G.R.
