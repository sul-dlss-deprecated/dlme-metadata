In that letter they ask us for some guidance as to the articles, with full specifications, of goodsneededfor Bahrain from Kngland after the war. We intend replying to them in detail stating quslities and enclosing certain specifications, such as designs, etc&lt;, of piecegoods that are most suitable for this market. ^ H in this connection we beg to invite a reference to your letter No. 2975-10/7 of 50th December 1945, in which you stated t hat labels only, instead of designs, could be^ registered as no legal provision exists for the registration of trade marks etc. in Bahrain. We beg to enquire whether it will now be possible for you to havo any designs to be registered here. Any such legaT measure, ir promulgated, will ooviate the chance of their imitation by any other manufacturers in other parts of the world. In addition, it will indirectly tend to hold the British trade in piecegoods in this market and wiii be a fillip to foster British trade for the future. Prom our experience, we beg to point out that Bahrain consumers, once they get used to a particular design, always prefer it to any other design, however superior in quality, manufactured by other countries© We shall be grateful for a favourable reply.

We enclose a copy of a letter dated the 16th December, 1948, from Messrs. Edward Evans &amp; Co. This has been referred to the Legal Adviser who feel's that we cannot answer the query without knowing more about the law in force in Bahrain and Kuwait. V.e therefore wish to know;- (a) what laws (made by the Shaikhs and under the Foreign jurisdiction Acts) there are in force in Bahrain and Kuwait concerning inventions and the protection of patents, and (b) how protection under these laws is obtained. V\e have ourselves been able to trace Article 28 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council 1913, anu Article 30 of the Kuwait Order-in-Council 1936. But we are not sure to what extent these previsions afford protection to inventions and patents, and we should be grateful for any inTormation which you can give us. Incidentally, this subject is relevant to the revision of the Orders-in-Council, and it may be that you will require to make proposals if the existing position is found to be unsatisfactory. We are sending a copy of this letter to the Commonwealth Relations Office for any information which they may be able to supply. In particular, they may be able' to let us know what is the effect of article 28 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council and Article 30 of the Kuwait Ordep-in-Council as regaras inventions and the protection of patents.

The question croppeu up in Kuvalt last year as a result of a proposal to establish, a clgaietle factory at Kuwait (which Incidentally has j ov: been put into effect) and under instructions from this hesi ency, the Political Agent suggested to the Shaikh that a system of registration should be introduced similar to that followed at Bahrain. The Shaikh replied that he considered triat any such system woulu be superfluous ir Kuwait as there v.ere no ranuiacturers there ana stated that he was roauj, to discipline tne cigarette factory if attempted to copy other brards. fre are inclined to think that it is unlikely that for the present any case of infringenient of patents or trade marks will arise in the Gulf states anu that if one were to arise it could probably be dealt with either under bectl r. 487 of the I.P.C or by executive action. If hovever you cor.siuer that the position shoula be regularised the best course will be for us to endeavour to persuade the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait to issue their own laws regarding patents and traue Piarks aid then to apply these laws by frin^'s Begulatione to all persons subject to the trders-in- courcil.

Dear Sir Rupert, I am sorry for being such a long time in reply ing to your semi-official letter No.(86/7/49), dated the 26th January, 1949, asking whether I think it would be possible to obtain a conviction under the procedure described in Article 44 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council if a British firm were to bring a crse against a Bahrain subject under Section 487 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. As you may well imagine, it would te vain to expect that a Joint Court could try such case with the formality and procedure just recently demanded, and more particularly as a trial would probably involve the deter mination of some fine points of law. There remains the District Court. But in my experience the procedure des- # cribed in Section 44 (a) has never been enforced, and, in these times, its enforcement might not \e free from difficulty. 3. Even supposing that procedural requirements were satisfied, it seems very doubtful whether such a prose cution would succeed. The section seems primarily to / contemplate deception of a ^ullic servant 1 or other specific person and to prove the intention required in the case of an infringement of a patent (as seems con templated by your letter) might well be difficult. 4. The application of a law to protect patents in Bahrain with other similar questions might perhaps be left to the legal expert whom it is proposed to post here. Yours sincerely.

We understand that no Patent Law or Law for the registration of Trade Marks or Designs has yet heen enacted in Bahrain Islands. According to information in our possession, a Trade Mark may 'be registered with the Political Agent on payment of a fee of two rupees and eight annas each, and, while a registration does not rest in the registrants proprietary rights with respect to the trade mark, the registration will, however, constitute useful evidence of ownership of the Mark in an action at common law instituted against any party infringing the rights of the registrant. We have been instructed on behalf of the above-named Company to take all steps possible to protect their Trade Mark rights in Bahrain Islands. We forward herewith the following documents: (1) Form of Authorisation of Agent, appointing us Agent for the above-named Company in connection with the registration of their Trade Mark. (2) Form of Application for the registration of the Trade Mark, in duplicate.The Political Agent, Bahrain Islands. Page (3) Four additional representations of the Trade Mark. The i'orm of Applioation and additional represen tations of the Trade Mark enclosed herewith have been pre pared in accordance with the forms used in connection with the registration of trade marks in the United Kingdom and other British countries. It seems nrobable that the fee for registerin 0, a trade mark is now greater than that mentioned above andT furthermore, that it may be desirable for a Cautionary Liotice in the Arabic and/or English languages to be published in Bahrain newspapers warning the public that proprietary rights are claimed by the abovenamed company in respect of the use of their Trade Mark in Bahrain Islands and that legu.1 proceedings will be instituted against any partv in fringing such rights.

In countries where laws for the registration of Trade I..arks have not been enacted, it is customary to publish Cautionary Notices in the Government Gazette or in newspapers;to the effect that the party claiming to be the owner of the Trade I.:arks will institute legal proceedings against any other party who encroaches upon or imringes his ^rade Hark Rights. This procedure is follow ed in the Aden Protectorate and also in the Sudan in the case of patent rights. The Po-iit^cal Agent in Kuwait has agreed to post on the notice board in the Political Agency, Cautionary Notices in the English and Arabic languages respecting Trade Hark and Patent Rights claimed as existing in Kuwait. He has also intimated his willingness to send copies of such Cautionary Notices to the Govern ment of Kuwait and to do what he can to see that justice is done in any case where such Patent or Trade Hark Rights are infringed. ./e shall be glad to know if you would be prepared to if follow in the case of latent and Trade Lark matters in Bahrain Islands the procedure followed in Kuwait and in the affirmative, whether, in your opinion, any useful purpose may possibly be served by following such a procedure. We should also be glad to know if there is an Official Gazette or Journal published by the Bahrain | Government in the Arabic language in which such Cautionary Notices might be inserted. In the event of there being no Official Gazette will you please say if there are any local newspapers published in Bahrain.

A rough draft of the Ordinance is enclosed, I would appreciate your comments on it. 2. Trade Marks are now 'being used in Bahrain with increasing frequency 'but there is no legislation to protect the users of Trade Marks. In the past various merchants have registered Trade Marks with the Bahrain Government and have 'been told that at some future date a regulation on the subject will be issued. Recently we have had a complaint that goods^imported into Bahrain under some sort of Trade Mark and other, inferior goods, have been exported from Bahrain under a similar mark and sold abroad to the detriment of the reputation of the original importer. 3. I would like to suggest that the Ordinance should be as simple and as plainly worded as possible with this object in view I have prepared the enclosed draft. I believe that if the Ordinance is issued we shall immediately have a great number of applications for registration of Trade Marks. Adviser to the Government, AY.No. 3o'7 v Political Agency, Bahrain, 11th July, 1960. Dear Residency, We enclose a copy of e draft ordi nance dealing with the registrstion of Trade Marks, ^hich has been sent to us by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. 2. We consider thrt the ordinance has been effectively and simply drafted and would suggest that it should be further applied by a King's Regulation to persons subject to the Bahrain Order in Council, Before doing this, you will no doubt wish to consult the Foreign Office, but the Ad viser has in any case asked us for any comments we may have. However we would be grateful if the matter could be dealt with as expeditiously as possible as there are considerable number of applications for registration of trade marks pending in this office. Yours ever.No .2^ Political Agency, Bahrain, 30th July, 1960. Dear Sirs, f s ^ With Reference to your^letters Nos. T.2099/CP, T.2099/CP, and T.2498-2603/CP, dated the 14th, 14th, and 16th June, res pectively, I am to inform you that it has been decided upon further consideration that steps should be taken for a proper register of Trade Marks patents and protected designs to be opened at this Political Agenty in res pect of all British and foreign firms which require protection in Bahrain. In view of the legal questions involved, the matter is now being discussed in London and a certain time will elapse before such a register can be opened. It will therefore be arranged for you to be informed when such registration becomes possible. In the mean time, however, I am to point out that any infringement of patent, trade mark, or copy right is open to redress in the Courts. Yours faithfully r Political Agent. Messrs.

Our general idea is to insist on registration in j^ngland before we register in our agency, provision is made for protection of rights so registered 'and we hoped that the Bahrain uovernment would also give their protection. kr, i ^elgrave tola me that there were many small local concerns which used a mark in nature of a trade mark «nQ it was these he wished to protect. Clearly we must make some provision for these. I did not think that there would be any demand for protection of local trade marks when the proposed regulation was drafted. I promised to let kr. Belgrave see a copy of the proposed regulation after it has been approved by the Board of Trade and he agreed that there was no urgency about his regulation. He would, therefore, hold his hand for the present. It was thought that 'Che agency should keep a register on the lines I have suggested and the Bahrain Government should keep a register of local trade marks to which we would afford protection. The Bahrain Government would to ive protection to trade marks and patents and designs registered with us. .nS regards drafting I fancy that kr. Belgrave has been assisted by the oudan ordinance regarding Trade ^arks. We looked at it ulso when dra. .ng regulatioi for my use in London, y 1 have s copy of kr.
