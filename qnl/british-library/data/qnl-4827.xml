I HAVE already informed their Lordships of my arrival at this port on the 25th 2 A X t the 26th, aceompanied hythe eaptains and officers 'Nvmohe' I paid a state visit to the Sultan, who received me again on the i7th m prS P audience P I was accompanied by Mr. Ghnrchill, and the Saltan had w.th h.m Churchill the letter of which a copy is attached, and so soon as the usual compliments had passed I addressed His % hne ^ it, pointing out and urging in the strongest manner that it '7^Itlhstandtog Trade could be allowed much longer to be carried on as at present that g an the money spent and the efforts made by Great Britain s ''. ce , the trade was carried on as briskly as ever; and that rf His ^ domestic trade it was imperative on him to work hand in hand wit . , i j \a pnlTd^wn tbe'foreign trade, otherwise I felt sure that oblige the Government to sweep both away together. I said that 1 thought the p p [443]made in my letter to Mr. Churchill (which Mr. Churchill read) would, if carried out by His Highness, divide the two trades by a broad line of demarcation, and that the foreign trade could then be no longer carried on under cover of the other. 4. At His Highness' invitation I called upon him this morning to hear the result of his deliberation; there were present, besides Mr. Churchill and myself, two Arab Councillors who are about to proceed to England on the subject of the Muscat subsidy. 5. His Highness began by stating his great anxiety to comply with all my wishes, and said he would at once order distinctive marks to be put upon the vessels engaged in the domestic traffic, but that some little time must elapse before the arrangements could be completed, and that he had already complied with a request of Mr. Churchill that the numbers shipped in each dhow should be but half of those hitherto crammed in. With respect to any other proposals, viz., that he should take the domestic import trade into his own hands, and allow but one port of export in Africa and one of import in Zanzibar, he stated that both he and his Councillors were sure their adoption would diminish his income; that he was now very poor, having been forced by England to pay the arrears of the Muscat subsidy; that the payment of the subsidy to the murderer of his brother was against his religion, and that he was about to send two trusted Councillors to England to beg to be excused from paying in future, and that if that were granted he might then be in a position to bear the financial loss which the adoption of my proposals would entail, but that for the present he could not face it. He said further that he intended to burn all Northern Arab dhows that arrived at Zanzibar, and he trusted that proved his anxiety to put down the outside traffic. 6. In reply, I thanked His Highness for the one concession he was prepared to make, and I endeavoured to show him that, under my proposal, it would be his own fault if, having the monopoly of the trade, he failed to raise from it a revenue equal to that which he now received in duties; but that it was clear from his statement that a large portion of what he now took in duties arose from slaves in excess of the wants of Zanzibar, and which were therefore eventually exported again, and that to that portion of his revenue 1 conceived he had no right consistently with his being a real and earnest opponent of the Foreign traffic. 1 pointed out also that the plea of poverty would hardly stand good, because he had always previously paid the subsidy without complaint, and would have continued to do so contentedly had his brother still lived and reigned in Muscat. I then said that I was not officially acquainted with what had passed in respect to the Muscat subsidy, but that as His Highness had devoted so large a portion of his remarks to that subject, I would give him my views, which were that England seeing two brothers, sons of a father who had been her old and valued friend, about to fight, stepped in at the wish of both brothers as arbitrator between them, and seeing that the kingdom about to be divided consisted of one portion rich and fruitful, and the other poor and barren, she decreed that the rich country should pay an annual subsidy to the poor one, but that it was not a personal payment by one Sultan to another, but payment by one country to another country. I said, moreover, that 1 conceived England could not, as His Highness seemed to suppose, release Zanzibar from paying the subsidy in exchange for concessions with respect to the Slave Trade, that the two questions had not necessarily anything to do with one another, and that I supposed the amount of the subsidy had been fixed solely from a consideration of the comparatively large revenue raised by Zanzibar. I said also that I was glad to hear that it was only a financial objection which His Highness made to my proposals, and that (as I understood) he would, when his Ambassadors returned, and he finally knew what he had to expect with respect to the subsidy, be ready again to take up their discussion. Finally, His Highness expressed a hope that now there was a Vice- Admiralty Court in Zanzibar all dhows detained in his dominions should be brought there; 1 explained the physical impossibility of towing them against the monsoon, but pointed out that although the dhows themselves might have been burnt, the legality of their capture would almost always be tested at Zanzibar, and that restitution in money could be claimed when dhows had been illegally destroyed. I attach a translation by Mr. Churchill, of the letter addressed to him by the Sultan, in reply to his which inclosed my proposal^. Under that letter, vessels not having the distinctive marks but with slaves on board might be captured throughout the year, subject to the condition of their being brought to Zanzibar. Mr. Churchill will endeavour to get rid of that condition, and if he succeeds, the concession will be of some small value. 8. I trust, however, that Her Majesty's Government will take advantage of the presence in England of the Ambassadors about to discuss the Muscat subsidv, and make engagements with them also on the subject of the Slave Trade, they having, I understand, power to deal with that question.9. The destruction of an insignificant per-centage of the plant employed in working a traffic yielding a profit of many hundreds per cent, can have no perceptible influence on that traffic, and the rescuing of negroes who have already gone through the greater portion of the sufferings incidental to their transfer from the interior of Africa is of doubtful good to the individuals so rescued. For twenty-five years we have followed one dull routine, capturing a few dhows here and there, rescuing a few slaves and consigning them to a fate which is certainly worse physically, whatever it may be morally, than that which awaited them in Arabia. We have paid from 10,000/. to 15,000Z. annually in bounties to the captors, and we are none the nearer the attainment of our end. 10. I think the time has come for changing out system and making a more earnest effort, and as the Sultan has rejected the proposals which I made to him, the ground is clear for other arrangements, and if the question is taken up by the Government, still more radical remedies might be applied. All civilized Governments have now completely washed their hands of the Slave Trade, and 1 see no reason why Zanzibar should be allowed to continue it. The legalizing of any traffic whatever by sea makes the repression of that which is illegal more difficult, and the population of the island being very large and the price of slaves in the market very low, there can be no real want of labour. 11. I would suggest:— 1st. That the Foreign Office should insist upon the adoption, after the expiration of one year (so as to give time for conveying information to the interior of Africa), of one port of export from Africa, and upon the gradual diminution of imports into Zanzibar, as recommended by Mr. Churchill, but on a still more rapidly declining scale, with a final cessation of all imports in six years; and as the amount of the Muscat subsidy was fixed from a comparison of the revenues of Zanzibar and Muscat, it would be but fair, when we enforce a reduction of the Zanzibar revenue, to allow the subsidy to decrease pari passu, and finally to cease at the same time as the Slave Trade, and thus a most embarrassing question would be got rid of. 2ndly. That the India Office should act both diplomatically and by means of the vessels belonging to the Bombay Government (which, if 'necessary, might receive special commissions to legalize their proceedings), upon the rulers on the coasts of Arabia and the Persian Gulf. 3rdly. That seeing that the export Slave Trade on the West Coast of Africa has now ceased to exist, their Lordships should reduce that squadron to a mere squadron of observation, and send the surplus to this side. 12. The principal additional expense, incidental to carrying out these suggestions, would be in the Vice-Consulates or Agencies which it would be necessary to establish at Kilwa, Lamoo, &amp;c., and in a small additional cost for freight of naval provisions; but it would soon be amply covered by the cessation of the large annual bounties now paid on account of captures. 13. I trust their Lordships will not think that 1 have given my opinion in too free a manner. Oue of the principal duties with which I am intrusted is the suppression of the East African Slave Trade, and if I have presumed to indicate the steps which I think should be taken by three great Departments of the State for finally attaining that object, it is because I feel that although what we have hitherto done may have annoyed and harassed the slave-traders, it has had no effect towards suppressing the trade. The successive exports for the last five years, from Kilwa alone, are officiallv reported as 18,500, 17,500, 16,821, 22,344, and 22,038. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) L. G. HEATH. Inclosure 2 in No. I.

I. know this, &amp;c Written on the 14th day of Jemadee-ul-ewwel, 1285. From your Friend, (L.S.) MAJID BIN SAEED. Inclosure 4 in No. 1. Commodore Sir L. Heath to Mr. Churchill. Si r ' Octavia,' at Zanzibar, August 25, 1868. I HAVE taken the earliest possible opportunity since the conclusion of the Abyssinian war to visit Zanzibar, because I think the time has come for taking more energetic measures than those which have as yet been adopted tor putting down the Arabian Slave Trade. 2. Our Treaties with Muscat (binding on Zanzibar since the separation of the two countries) date from 1843. Since which time although England has kept up a large naval force with a view'to suppressing this Traffic, there has been no diminution, but rather an increase of the number of slaves exported from the dominions of His Highness the Sultan. This export trade is carried on under cover of the local trade which was legalized by the Treaty of 1843, and the experience of twenty-five years shows that there will be no chance of putting it down unless a very broad line of distinction is drawn between it and the local traffic. It is with this view that I beg you will propose to His Highness the Sultan:— 1. That he should make the' Slave Trade a Government monopoly, and indemnify himself by its profits for the loss of the existing Custom-house duties, or else make it a private monopoly under strict inspection, indemnifying himself by a largely increased import duty. 2. That the vessels employed should either be vessels of European build, or if dhows that they should be painted a distinctive colour (say all red), and that the sail should be marked with a distinctive mark (say a black cross extending right across the sail). 3. That the Traffic should be confined to one port (say Darra Salaam) on the coast of Africa, and one port (say Zanzibar) on the Island of Zanzibar. 4. That all intermediate traffic by sea between ports on the mainland be forbidden, as also all direct importation from the mainland to Pemba or other island dependencies, which should be supplied solely by Government vessels from Zanzibar. 5. That the Traffic so regulated shall be legal only as at present, viz., between 1st May and 1st January. It would be as well that His Highness should be made aware that I submit these proposals for his consideration solely in accordance with my general instructions to do my best to put down the East African Slave Trade, and that I have no special mission on the subject.

HER Majesty's ship ' Star' arrived on the afternoon of the 16th instant with a cargo of slaves ; 134 slaves were captured from twenty-three Arab dhows, off the East Coast of Africa. I regret to report that small-pox broke out amongst them on the voyage ; the first case was a month ago. On arrival at Aden there were only two cases amongst the negroes, and one sailor who was convalescent. The whole of the slaves have been landed on an island in the inner harbour and segregated; none have been brought on shore to the Peninsula. I have ordered all the slaves to be vaccinated, and the officer commanding the 'Star' has had his men vaccinated. I consider there is no likelihood of the disease spreading. 1 purpose submitting to Government a report on the subject of the discharge of cargoes of slaves by Her Majesty's ships at this isolated position. Inclosure 3 in No , 2. The Resident at Aden to the Secretary to Government, Bombay. gj r Aden, December 24, 1868. REFERRING to paragraph 6 of my letter of the 18th instant in this Department, I have the honour to report, for the information of his Excellency the Governor in Council, that Captain de Kantzow, commanding Her Majesty s ship ' Star, has informed me Her Majesty's ship ' Daphne ' is expected to arrive here immediately with between 300 and 400 slaves, captured from dhows on the East Coast of Africa. As I have already a balance on mv hands of former captures of about 30 in addition to 129, brought by Her Majesty s ship ' Star,' I consider this large number of slaves will be a greater burden than Her Majesty's Government could expect this isolated settlement to bear. I cannot find suitable employment and protection for the slaves landed in March last; even in addition to this, 1 have the cargo already landed, and w T ith those expected, 1 consider that I shall be placed in further difficulty. I am ol opinion that the landing of slaves at this port to be kept a considerable time under surveillance, is to the unfortunate beings a state of slavery. Aden is already glutted, and it is quite impossible to keep a proper supervision over the liberated slaves, distributed as they are in all parts of this settlement. [443] C6 I maintain that the slave handed over and assigned for service to private individuals, is in a worse position than one that is purchased. A man will take care possibly of property for which he pays; this mav not be the case where the supervision cannot be carried out in every individual case. Were we in a position here to educate the slaves I consider we should be doing what was right by them. Such means not being at our disposal, I nronose sending to Bombay all those now left on my hands, and any cargoes that may arrive for the future. In Bombay there are certainly better means for properly providing for and educating these people. 1 may observe that it is a source of anxiety to provide for the already overgrowing population of Men. These difficulties are in my opinion so grave that I submit this matter for the earnest consideration of Government with a view to this settlement being relieved from the discharge of liberated slaves from Her Majesty s ships The vessels might come here for adjudication, but I would submit that some other place for the discharge of their cargoesjmight be assigned. Another reason which influences me to urge this is, that the slaves frequently arrive with epidemic disease amongst them. We have no country or space beyond such as is within the fortifications, and we are thus further placed in difficulties, and rendered liable to a visitation from a scourge in our limited position. I shall with anxiety await orders with reference to the disposal of liberated slaves. ' 1 have, &amp;c. (Signed) K. L. RUSSELL. Inclosure 4 in No. 2. Commodore Sir L. Heath to Sir S. Fitzgerald. Rio-ht Hon. Sir, &lt;! Octavia,' at Bombay, January 19, 1869. IN reply to letter of the 13th instant from Mr. Secretary Gonne, and its inclosures from Sir E. Russell, on the subject of the disposal, &amp;c., of captured slaves, I beg in the first place to inform your Excellency that the liberated slaves which Sir E. Russell expected to receive have all been landed at the Seychelles. 2. With respect to the general question raised by Sir E. Russell in his despatch of the 24th December last, I am unable to point out any port which could be substituted for that of Aden as a primary depot for liberated slaves, without diminishing to a serious extent the efficiency of the squadron employed in their liberation. 3. It is essential to the health of the crews of our men-of-war that captured slaves, who are frequently diseased, and always most filthy in their personal habits, should be landed with as little delay as possible*; and it is equally egsential to the carrying out of the service with efficiency that the vessels should speedily return to their cruizing- ground. For these purposes Seychelles towards the south, and Aden towards the north, are well suited, and the one or the other is chosen by the Commander of the capturing vessel, according to the position of his ship and the monsoon which rtiay at the time be blowing. 4. There are, both at Seychelles and at Aden, small islands which can be, and indeed are, used for the purpose of quarantine; and it is an incidental advantage that complete isolation can be carried out when any epidemic disease is brought into either settlement. 5. I never personally had an opportunity of investigating the condition of liberated slaves, but I have heard that there is a general opinion in conformity with that of Sir E. Russell, that their condition as free men is not superior to that from which they have been removed. 6. I am not aware of the wording of the Orders in Council referred to in the 5th Geo. IV, chap. 113, for regulating the 'protecting and providing for'' captured slaves, but it is the undoubted duty of England to do all that can be done in this direction; and if (as implied by Sir E. Russell) the education and training which ought to be given to these unfortunate creatures, before launching them into a new world, where all, even the language, is strange to them, cannot be afforded at Aden, then I think they ought as soon as possible be transferred to Bombay, where I presume there is a regularly organized system of registration and supervision of apprentices. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) L. G. HEATH.Commodore Sir L. Heath to the Secretary to the Admiralty. 'Forte' at Sea, Lat. 20° 4' N., Long. 61° 43' April 9, 1869. PREVIOUSLY to leaving Bombay, I was informed by his Excellency the Governor that he had submitted the inclosed letter to the Advocate-General of Bombay, and that that officer had given an opinion that the capture and condemnation ot the dhowlso. 1, mentioned by Sir E. Russell, was illegal. , t j- rva: 2. Sir Seymour informed me that he had sent the correspondence to the India Umce, and he promised to send me the Advocate-General's opinion ; but owing:, probably, to want of time it did not reach me before sailing. The Advocate-General, however, had not the evidence given by the officers of the ' Star ' before him, and it was his opinion only, and not the reasons on which it was founded, which was to have been communicated to me; and I therefore, do not wait for the written document, but forward the remainder ot the correspondence for their Lordships' information, and with a request I may receive instructions for future guidance. 3. I understand that the Advocate-General considers it essential that a captor should prove that the slaves on board the captured vessel are there for the purpose of Slave Trade, and that their being in the state of slavery, and, therefore, liable to possible sale, not s ^ ffi ^ t e ' s t, int retation of the Treaties will, if upheld, strike a severe blow at our efforts to put down this trade ; for the result will assuredly be that every trading dhow will carry a small number of slaves purchased by the master, who will take care to have no condemnatory documents on board, and who will keep to himself his intentions as to future dlSP T l Under theTst Article of the Treaty with Muscat, dated October 1845, the Sultan en^es to prohibit, under severe penalties, the export ot slaves from his African domimo s. IntfTe 2nd Article he engages to prohibit similarly their importation from Africa into h s Asiatic dominions, and the 3rd Article gives power to our ships to seize Zanzibar vessels ' 'Tit Z m Z ZtL interpretation of the Treaty as a whole, to consider the three Articles as in harmony with one another, and that the 3rd punish in our way the very same offences which the Sultan undertakes m the -nd Articles to punish in his way: and that as the Sultan wdl or an importer, so, in our case, slave-trading must he deemed to consist in either export or import and they need not necessarily be combined. , , • t i Article 7. If this be so, the export of a slave heyond the limits defined in the Third Article is sufficient to confiscate the vessel in which the export is made. thinkW that 8 Sir Edward Russell seems to agree with the Advocate-General in thinking t ow^ers^f'th^sl^e-car^ng^howl 1 whereas 1 1 ^underst^id^h^Advoc^-General considers tta7w\?tevelr e ma b y y havVbe^he'origifaTohjec?

(Signed) C. GONNE. Inclosure 2 in No. 3. The Resident at Aden to the Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, Aden, January '^9, 1869. IN forwarding the manumitted slaves to Bombay, 1 have the honour to inform you that there are a certain number of th.em who declare themselves domestic slaves, and state that they were employed as sailors on board the dhows from which they were taken, and moreover express a wish to return to their homes in the vicinity of Zanzibar. As I have no means of complying with their wish 1 send them with others to Bombay that Govern ment may dispose of them as they may deem fit. 2. In bringing this fact to the notice of his Excellency the Governor in Council, I beg to point out that 1 consider it was impossible for one to act otherwise than to condemn the dhows trom which these slaves weie captured, owing to the evidence given before me by Captain de Kantzow and his officers, from which it appears to me they were fully justified in concluding that their captures were authorized by the law in force; as an instance, I will quote the case of dhow No. 1, which is, however, the only case out of the twenty-four in which all her slaves, since their landing at this port, have declared themselves as domestic slaves, employed as sailors, and expressed a wish to return. This vessel, when detained, had her crew separated from her passengers and slaves (there were only six of the latter, the men in question) ; the crew and passengers were landed, but six men detained as slaves, as they stated they were such. Each day they were inspected after their removal to the ' Star,' they had an opportunity of bringing forward their claims to have been landed with the crew, but they failed to move in the matter; nor did any one of them by word or gesture give any reasons for supposition that he was anything but a slave. It was not until after their arrival here that they came forward, and during the investi gation of the cases I had no reason to doubt—from the evidence of one of these men particularly, and from the amount of intelligence he displayed, and his acquaintance with the nature and quantity of the cargo of the dhow—but that he was what he stated himself to be, a domestic slave employed as a sailor, and not a slave for traffic ; all six in fact I have no hesitation in saying, vere similarly employed. This dhow had a crew of nineteen men besides these six domestic slaves, and was laden with a considerable carao, and the evidence proved that at the time of capture her principal object was legitimate trade. 3. Seeing that this dhow had these six men slaves on board, although they were domestic ones and that Captain de Kantzow had. given them every opportunity of landing before the destruction of the dhow, and subsequently of declaring their true status • and moreover that the dhow had no papers or colours, and was entering slaves' port where slaves were being then run, and that the men admitted themselves they were slaves I felt that I had no alternative but to condemn her and justify the act of Captain de Kantzow 4. In passing judgment in several of the cases, however, I felt that too much discre tionary power was placed in the hands of Commanders of Her Majesty's cruizers engaged in suppression of the Slave Trade on the East Coast of Africa, I respectfullv submit to Governmeni the adv.saM.ty of m,mediate steps being taken for the issne of more stringent and definite ordeis on the subject, whereby the status of domestic slavery may not be interfered with and legl .mate trade paralyzed, and the minds of the Arabs irritated by such wholesale destruction of their property, on the grounds of some few men being found who through an interpreter, adm.t that they are slaves, and separated accordingly from the rest o( he crew, and with a few other suspicious points, legalize the condemnation o' a vesse of several tons, laden with a legitimate cargo. • 5 ; Tb l '1®° Sl ' eS , which we are determined to put down, 1 presume is that earned on by dhows carrying large cargoes of these unfortunate creatures, whoTre mostly ch.ldren and women ; and an order to the effect that no dhow should be destroyed except■1 one proved and apparent to be, or to have been recently so laden, would insure no grievance to suspicious or even lawful traders. An order to this effect might afford an escape to some who are evading the Slave Trade regulations, but, on the other hand, a great injustice is avoided, and T am of opinion that if the wholesale destruction of dhows is permitted the British name will be abhorred, and the minds of the Chiefs and natives will be turned decidedly against us, and thus the native in authority will aid the trade instead of assisting us. I trust my proceedings will be approved by his Excellency in Council. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) E. L. RUSSELL. Tnclosure 3 in No. 3. Commodore Sir L. Heath to the Sir S. Fitzgerald. Right Hon. Sir, ' Octavia' at Bombay, February 16, 1869. I HAVE the honour, in accordance with the request of your Excellency, conveyed by Mr. Secretary Gonne, in his letter of the 13th instant, to make the following remarks upon the letter dated the 29th January last, from Major-General Sir Edward Russell to the Political Secretary. o- uj j 2. It is the province of the Judges of Vice-Admiralty Courts of whom Sir Edward is one, to do justice between captured and captors, and therefore in every case where condemnation is decreed, the captors' conduct is, ipso facto, justified. . , ■ . 3 Sir Edward's letter contains no actual censure of naval officers, but its tenor is such that it is right I should inform you Excellency as a proof of the great care taken in the squadron under my command, that although sixty-nine vessels have been destroyed by Her Majesty's ships, no case of restitution has been decreed. „ „ . • , 4 It appears to be Sir Edward's opinion, that domestic slaves may lawfully be c a rried as part of the crew of an Arab dhow; but it is distinctly laid down m paragraph 51, page 22 of the Slave Trade Instructions—That you will be justified m concluding that a vessel is engaged in, and equipped for the Slave 1 rade : 'I. If you find any slaves on board ; or, • i ,, ' II If vou find in her outfit any of the equipments hereinafter-mentioned : * * * * .... There is no limitation as to the status of the slaves, and since it is the opinion of many officers that domestic slaves are frequently carried, as described by Sir Edward Russell, and sold when a good price can be obtained, it would clearly be unwise to make a hrmtat ^ more unw i se wou id it be to carry out the further relaxations of existing rules recommended by Sir Edward. The only result of such a measure would be that slaves would not be carried as separate cargoes, but almost every dhow on the c o ast 3 ld ^ them in numbers within the then legal limits. The miseries endured by ^ slaves on the voyage would be certainly much diminished, and as no dhows would be condemned, none would be captured, and the heart-burnings spoken of by Sir Edward Russell would cease, but these advantages would be gained at the cost of practically f e tra ^ have 6 Our measures for repressing the Slave Trade on the East Coast of Africa, ha\e now been carried on for so many years, that it is impossible to suppose any of the legal traders on that Coast can be ignorant of our regulations and they must know full * el that the carrying of a small number of slaves on board their vessel is one most frequent cause of condemnation.

' Star,' at Bombay, March &amp;\, 1869. WITH reference to the first dhow taken by Her Majesty's ship ' Star ' at Brava, I have the honour to submit the following statement as regards her capture : 1st. While at anchor at Brava, with Her Majesty's ship 'Daphne' lying in sight, about three miles to windward, and our boats close to and in-shore of her, two dhows were observed coming down. The first was taken and burnt by the ' Daphne,' the other was captured bv our cutter and brought alongside, with a crew of nineteen, six male slaves, and no papers no colours, and a cargo of wood. She stated she had come from Paza, and was going to Brava. Six slaves who gave themselves up to the boarding officer, through the interpreter, were brought on board and acknowledged themselves slaves to me, in the presence of the officers of the ship, not expressing any wish to be landed. The Arab Captain and his crew desired to be landed forthwith, which was done. 2ndly. On the further examination into the history of these slaves when on board, three of them volunteered to work, and were employed in the stoke-hole. On one occasion when some of the slaves were pumping out the ship, one of the slaves captured in the first dhow stood over them to make them work, at which they growled, inasmuch as he was a slave as well as them. One of these six slaves when examined in my cabin by me stated, through the interpreter, he had been taken at Paza, and that when the Aia Captain saw our boat coming toward the dhow, he exclaimed, ' I have lost my dhow now, because I have got slaves on board.'' . , , These slaves were periodically mustered with the other 126 slaves on board, and never at any time expressed to'any one any dissatisfaction at their capture, but, on ihe contrarv, satisfaction at their release.

I beg you will inform their Lordships that Commander Meara states that Captain Barnardiston having returned all his slave papers and those addressed to himself not having at that time reached him, he was not aware of the mutual agreement between the French and English Governments, under which the boarding of vessels with French colours is forbidden except for the purpose (when fraud is expected) of verifying the right to fly those colours ■2. No complaints have, however, been made on the subject, and I thi nk it a most fortunate circumstance that Commander Meara should have been thus ignorant of the rules laid down, as otherwise the facts recorded in his Report might not have been brought t0llfe 3 t Their Lordships have recently forwarded to me a copy of a letter from Sultan Maiid of 3rd April, 1869, in which he states that in order to avoid being searched by English cruizers his vessels are all rapidly leaving their proper national colours and placing ^T 'Tventure S^l ^staplest remedy for this evil that the French Govern ment should be moved to take steps for stopping the j n f C ! 1 ^TheTo e pe 0 rt V of French Francisation' at Nos Beh, confining their issue to vessels bona Jide the propeity ot French sub i ects - I have, &amp;c. (Signed) L. G. HEATH.12 Inclosure in No. 4. Commander Meara to Commodore Sir L. Heath. Si 1 '* ' Nymphe,' at Aden, June 5, 1869. I HAVE to report to you that during my cruize along the West Coast of Madagascar in the months of February and March this year, for the suppression of the Slave Trade, I met a number of dhows under French colours, which 1 boarded, and found that they all had French papers, signed by the Governors of Mayotta and Nos Beh. While lying at anchor in Bembatooka Bay, off the town of Majunka, a dhow with French colours arrived, which I boarded myself and asked for her papers, which were shown me. I asked if there were any passengers on board; the captain answered, Yes,—they are all mentioned in the papers. There were thirteen slave women and four- boys on board, who stated that they had.been bought at Zanzibar. No one on board spoke one word of French I took a copy of his papers, which I beg to forward. Acting Lieutenant Clarke, during his cruizing in the boats, has boarded thirteen dhows under French colours, six of which he considered to be suspicious—one having six slaves on board, but as she was under French colours she was not searched. Another dhow under French colours he chased into an inlet near False Cape, on the West Coast of Madagascar, which chase occupied five hours. On boarding her, she showed French papers from Nos Beh, and from the appearance of the state of the dhow she looked very much as if she had just landed a cargo of slaves. Acting Lieutenant Clarke landed early next morning and went about four miles into the bush, found numerous tracks of human beings, but only came across four or five natives, who were fishermen, which led him to believe that slaves had been landed from that same dhow, and driven into the country. Sub-Lieutenant Hodgson also boarded eight dhows under French colours while boat- cruizing, and he also reported to me that two of them were very suspicious. I also beg to report to you, that during the cruize of Her Majesty's ship 4&lt; Nymphe'' on the same coast in 1868, the officers have reported to me that only ten dhows under French colours were seen; whereas this year I have seen as many as fiftv, and I may sav more, under French colours, I am, &amp;c.
