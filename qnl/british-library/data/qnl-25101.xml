WITH reference to my despatch No. 117 of the 17th May, forwarding a complaint from the Persian Government respecting the alleged non-fulfilment by Messrs. Strick of article 12 of their contract for the purchase of oxide, I have the honour, to forward to you herewith copy of a letter dated the 17th May, 1912, which that firm have addressed to the Persian Minister in London. Messrs. Strick’s Tehran agent informs me that his principals consider that this letter clearly sets forth the position which they have taken up in regard to the Weir-Ellinger claims, and that they have nothing to add to it. I have the honour to report that on receipt of your telegram No. 296 of the 1st July I addressed a note to the Persian Government in reply to their two communications informing them that I had referred the question to His Majesty’s Government, and that I was awaiting your views. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Messrs. Strick and Co. to Mirza Mehdi Khan. Sir, _ May 17, 1912. WE have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s letter of the 16th ultimo, in which } t ou inform us that your Government has instructed you to request us to settle Messrs. Ellinger and Co.’s claim against the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and to notify us that we are to send no more ships to load oxide at Ormuz until the matter is settled. In reply, we can only confirm our letter to your Excellency dated the 28th July last, when we pointed out that, in face of the supplemental agreement dated the 4th December, 1908, between the Muin-ut-Tujjar and Messrs. Ellinger and Co., of the one part, and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., of the other part, any claim these firms might make on him in respect of their contract with him of same date for supplies of Ormuz red oxide must fail; and that the Muin-ut-Tujjar could establish no claim on your Excellency’s Government in respect of his liability to Messrs. Weir and/or Ellinger, because he was under no such liability. We also pointed out that, in our contract with your Excellency’s Government, we only undertook responsibility for any lawful—we repeat lawful—claim that Messrs. Weir and/or Ellinger might have on the Muin-ut-Tujjar or the Government. In view of the supplemental contract, neither of these firms have a lawful claim either against your Excellency’s Government or against the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and, consequently, the question of our having to do anything does not arise. We are much surprised that your Excellency’s Government should suggest that anything has occurred which will in any way relieve them from their responsibility to make shipment upon vessels which we may send for red oxide in accordance with the contract. We would respectfully point out that, if they do, then they will be commit ting a very serious and most unjustifiable breach of their contract with us. Our agreement with your Excellency’s Government we are, and always have been, ready to carry out to the letter, and, even if the view we take of the contract is wrong—which, of course, we do not for one moment admit—that is a question for adjustment in the proper way between us, and does not permit of your Excellency’s Government commit ting a breach of contract on their own part in refusing to load our steamers. The consequences of such a breach would be very serious. We must, of course, look to your Excellency’s Government to strictly carry out their obligations under the contract with us, and they may rely upon our carrying out all our obligations to them.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 28.) (No. 192.) gi rj Tehran, October 12, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch No. 183 of the 2nd October, transmitting a copy of the note which I addressed to the Persian Government presenting the claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger arising from the dispossession of Muin-ut-Tujjar from the Hormuz oxide mines, I have the honour to enclose herewith a translation of the note which I have now received from the Persian Government in reply. The Persian Government maintain that the firman of 1904, by not fixing a period for the duration of Muin’s lease, left them the right of cancelling it at any moment. I think it would be difficult seriously to dispute this _ pretension of the Persian Government, especially in the case of one of its own subjects. But as the contract with Messrs. Weir and Ellinger was made before the lease was cancelled, and was only for such a reasonable period ahead as was required by the exigencies of commerce, we can very fairly contend that the Government, on taking possession, should have carried out the provisions of the contract as I called upon them to do m my notes to the Persian Government of the 11th and 12th April, 1910. ' It is true that, if we admit the legality of the Persian Government’s action, their second argument, founded on the terms of Muins supplementary agreement (No. 3, in enclosure in Messrs. Ellinger and Co.’s letter to the foreign Office of the 26th July, 1910), has to be met. I think, however, that it may be pointed out that this agreement merely relieves Mum from personal liability for damages, and does not relieve the Persian Government from their obligation to carry out the bond fide engagements of Muin existing at the time he was summarily ejected. When this question was first discussed it was assumed by the Foreign Office that either Muin entered fraudulently into his contract with Messrs. Weir and Ellmger, oi that the Persian Government acted illegally in dispossessing him. I think that it is now clear that neither of these assumptions is necessarily correct, but that Muin, so long as he was in undisputed possession under his indefinite firman, was entitled to make reasonable contracts, especially with the proviso contained in the supple mentary agreement, and that the Persian Government were equally entitled to cancel his lease w T hen they pleased. They should, however, in lieu of reasonable notice being given, have respected Muin’s current engagements, and their third argument, that the contract should have been countersigned by the Government, falls to the ground, as the absence of this formality does not, according to the Commercial treaty ml luico- manchai, invalidate the contract of the defendant; in this case Muin acknowledges his signature. Moreover, by my note of the 8th August, 1909, the Persian Government, some time before the actual cancelling of the lease, were warned of the existence of the contract. The supplementary agreement to which the Persian Government attach importance was equally devoid of the formality in question^ The rest of the Persian Government’s note deals with the question of Messis. Strick’s responsibility under article 12 of their contract for any legal claim arising hom the non-fulfilment of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger’s contract, and hints that if Messis. Strick do not meet this responsibility, their contract will also be treated as null and 'it will thus be seen that, while not disputing the right of the Persian Government to disnossess Muin when they did, it would still not be difficult to _ make out a good case for the claim for compensation on account of the violation of Mum s contract with Messrs. Weir and Ellinger, yet if I restrict my arguments to those advanced above, there remains little or no justification for the additional claim of Messrs. Ellinger for the sum of 3,487Z. 10s. for loss of agency. This claim, I take it, can only be based on the illegality or Muin’s dispossession, and insistence on this point would I venture to think, deeply resented by the Persian Government, and thus be prejudicial to future dealings between them and British firms of all kinds. [2219 ee—2]In these circumstances, I have the honour to request your instructions as to the reply which I should make to the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, September 30, 1911. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 9th September last respecting the claims of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger in connection with the oxide of the Hormuz mines. In reply, I have the honour to draw the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the point that the Persian Government, by not fixing the terms in the firman of the year 1904, had reserved to itself the right of cancelling the lease of the Hormuz mines at any moment, and it has been for the same reason that the Muin-ut-Tujjar, in making the contract, has, by separate documents, made conditions with the above-mentioned firms to the effect that, should the Government make such changes in the administration of the Hormuz mines which might define or abolish the Muin’s control over them the contract would be cancelled and the firms would have no right to claim compensation. The acceptance of these conditions by the firms in question points to the fact that they have been aware of the right of the Government to cancel the firman at any time. It was necessary that the firms should have done this business with the knowledge of the Persian Government and have their contracts countersigned by the Government. Having failed to respect this point, which would have strengthened their contract, and having had no dealings with the Government in this connection, the firms cannot bring any claims which might be allowed by His Majesty’s Government to be enforced against the Persian Government, which has legally cancelled the lease held by its own lessee and its own subject. By article 12 of their contract, Messrs. Strick undertake full responsibility for meeting the legal claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger, so that no loss may be incurred by the Government or the Muin-ut-Tujjar in connection with this case. On the 5th July last the Persian Legation in London warned Messrs. Strick that if in twenty days the claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger are not put an end to Messrs. Strick would be responsible for damages. If the British Government consider the claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger legal, they must also hold Messrs. Strick responsible for their settlement. If the British Government do not consider the claims legal, why should they prefer them against the Persian Government ? Y r our Excellency has considered the responsibility of Messrs. Strick and the claims of Weir and Ellinger to be two different questions, and has stated in the note under reply that “any counter-claims which the latter consider they have to make on this head against Messrs. Sirick and Co. is a matter for separate settlement between the Persian Government and that firm.” In reply, I |have the honour to state that this is not a claim which could be settled between the Imperial Government and Messrs. Strick, but it is^ a full responsibility incurred by that firm in connection with the business in question, and they are bound to get it settled. In case Messrs. Strick fail to meet their responsibility, the business entered into by them will be null and void. f .. view of the above circumstances, I have full confidence m your Excellency’s sense oi justice that you will admit the observations made by the Persian Government, and that you will inform your Government accordingly.

WITH reference to our conversation on the 12th February, when I suggested the possibility of the oxide mines at Hormuz furnishing security for a loan to the Persian Government to provide for the requirements of the Swedish gendarmerie in the south of Persia, I have since had an opportunity of going more closely into the figures which I give you herein, to put before Sir L.

We are prepared to take 6,000 tons per auniun ol the usual quality ot Hormuz oxide, as hitherto shipped from that place, for a period of five years, at a price of 43s. 9d. per ton free on board at Hormuz. . In view of the unfortunate result of the last contract with the Muin-ut-lujjai, we trust Sir Edward Grey may find it possible to ask His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to do all he can to secure us the benefit of the new contract. In accordance with the suggestion made by Sir Edward Grey, we yesterday approached Mr. Strick with a view to coming to some arrangement with him by means of which our interests may be made identical, and we hand you enclosed copy of our letter to Mr. Ellinger in reference to this. As Mr. Strick has now been informed of our intention to apply for a new contract, it is obviously desirable, in the absence of any affirmative reply from him, that we should lose no time in making our application known to the Persian Government, and we should be obliged if the information can be communicated by cable to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

Should he not reply within reasonable time or reply unfavourably, Weir is anxious to apply for contract on expiration of Strict’s present contract. It is desirable, therefore, that no agreement should be signed at Tehran pending uncertainty as to Strict’s reply. Strict tnows that Weir intends to apply for contract in absence of agreement between the two. I gather that Strict has not so far himself applied for renewal of contract. Weir is being told that he must send us his own application, and that His Majesty’s Government cannot act as his agents.

Andrew Weir and Co. were duly safeguarded. Sir W. Townley recently reported that Muin was again working the concession, and Sir E. Grey accordingly enquired, by telegraph, whether the condition alluded to had been fulfilled. Sir W. Townley then explained that, according to information furnished to him by M. Mornard, Muin’s concession had not been restored to him on the terms on which he had formerly held it. Under his original firman he had free disposal of the mines in return for the payment of a small annual land tax, whereas under his present concession he is regarded merely as an agent of the Persian Government, receiving 15 per cent, for his expenses in working the mines, while he is bound to fulfil the conditions of the contract between the Persian Government and Messrs. Strick and Co., which precludes the shipment of oxide to other parties. This arrangement having been sanctioned by an act of the Medjliss, M. Mornard has no power to modify it. Sir W. Townley accordingly sees no way of safeguarding your interests, and can only suggest that you should apply for the option for a fresh contract after the expiration^ in March 1915, of that held by Messrs. Strick. 1 am to state that Sir E. Grey concurs in Sir W. Townley’s view. He is, however, of opinion that you should seriously consider the advisability of endeavouring to arrive at some amicable arrangement with Messrs.

Foreign Office to Messrs. Ellinger &amp; Go. Gentlemen, Foreign Office, January 29, 1913. I AM greeted by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the shipment of red oxide from the island of Hormuz. With reference to the request contained in that communication, I am to state that the interpretation of the supplemental agreement alluded to does not fall within Sir E. Grey’s province and that the paragraph, quoted by you, which occurs in the letter from this Office of the 19th April last, was accordingly not intended as an expression of any opinion on the matter in one sense or the other. The point which it was intended to emphasise by this paragraph was that, had Sir E. Grey made representations to the Persian Government based on the fact that their cancellations of Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession was unjust to him as not giving him an opportunity of making arrangements about his contracts, they would not improbably have replied that no injustice to Muin was involved because he had protected himself bv the recent supplemental agreement against claims brought against him in such circumstances. This argument could with difficulty have been met without a discussion of the legal effect of the agreement into which Sir E. Grey could hardly have entered, while as Muin would no doubt have maintained that the agreement did in fact protect him, it would clearly have been impossible for Sir E. Grey to urge the opposite point of view in representations made to the Persian Government on Muin’s behalf. I am to state that it was in this sense that the words quoted by you were used. I have, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY.;ThisJ3ocument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governmen t] PERSIA. [January 22.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [3312] No. i. Messrs. Ellinger &amp; Go. to Foreign Office,—(Received January 22.) Sir, 28, Oxford Street, Manchester, January 20, 1913. WE beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the (jth instant, the contents of which will, we are sure, be of great service to us in explaining fully the considerations which have led Sir E. Grey to the conclusions mentioned in the first paragraph of your letter. We are greatly obliged for this assistance. We are desirous of coming to some settlement with the Muin-ut-Tujjar, if possible, without recourse to the law courts or arbitration, and in this connection we venture to draw your attention to a paragraph in your letter of the 19th April last, which we are much afraid may be relied upon by the Muin-ut-Tujjar as an expression of opinion on the part of the Foreign Office that he is protected by the supplemental contract. The paragraph in question reads as follows :— “ If this be so, it seems clear that the cancellation was, as between the Persian Government and Muin, only unjust if made at unreasonably short notice and without giving him an opportunity of making arrangements as regards his contracts, while as Muin had provided in those contracts that he was not to be liable if the Government prevented him from carrying them out, it would have been difficult for His Majesty’s Government to interfere on those grounds even at that time.” We do not understand ourselves that the above paragraph was intended as an expression of opinion applicable to the events that have happened, but it is capable of being so read, and would naturally carry very much more weight with the Muin than any legal opinions that we could obtain from our own advisers to a contrary effect. The Muin has always throughout the controversy contended that the supplementary contract protects him from any claims Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. and ourselves can put forward, and we feel that the paragraph we have quoted will stand very much in our way, and is calculated to afford him mistaken encouragement to rely on the supplemental agreement as his answer to any claim on our part, whereas we are strongly advised that the supplemental agreement does not protect the Muin in the events that have happened for the reason shortly that the Muin entered into the contract without having any conces sion that justified him in doing so, and that his inability to carry out the contract was due to this cause only, and not to any of the events contemplated by the supplemental agreement. We shall be very much obliged if the Secretary of State will re-consicler the para graph in question, and, allowing for the probability that the Muin has read it in a way that was not intended, will further assist us by giving us an intimation to that effect. We are, &amp;c. ELLINGEE &amp; CO. [27G3 y—2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA. ^ CONFIDENTIAL. [50364] No. 1 . Foreign Office to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. Gentlemen, Foreign Office, January 6, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you that he has under his consideration the request recently made by you that you should be supplied with a statement or the considerations which have led him to the conclusion that the concession, under which Muin-ut-Tujjar held the right to work the oxide on the island of Hormuz, was not one in perpetuity, but could be withdrawn at any time by the Persian Government. Sir E. Grey considers that, in the present state of the case, you are entitled to the information you desire, and I am to put before you the following considerations :— There is no dispute that the concession granted by the firman of 1312 (1895) to Malik-ut-Tujjar, whose rights under it were transferred to Muin-ut-Tujjar in 1897, was limited to a period of ten years. This is expressly stated in the firman of 1315 (1898), which confirmed that of 1312, and Muin-ut-Tujjar has never attempted to deny that his rights under the original concession were confined to the term of ten years laid down therein. The question therefore is the interpretation to be put upon the firman of 1322 (1904), which, according to the contention of Muin-ut-Tujjar, transformed his concession from a temporary and limited into a permanent and indefeasible one. The firman in question was granted to Muin-ut-Tujjar a short time before the expiry of the period for which his original concession ran. The only phrases which can be quoted as showing that its effect was to confer upon Muin-ut-Tujjar a concession in perpetuity are rendered in the translation annexed to the pamphlet issued by Muin as follows : “ It is settled that Haji Moin shall retain his possession as before,” and “ from the date of issue of this patent and onward we cede the aforesaid islands and places to him.” In the translation furnished by His Majesty’s legation at Tehran these phrases are rendered respectively “ it is decreed by us that the above-mentioned islands and places shall remain in the lease and possession of Muin-ut-Tujjar, and his concessions are protected as in the past,” and “ from the date of the issue of this Imperial firman henceforth we intrust the above-mentioned islands and places to Muin-ut-Tujjar. ” It appears that Muin relies principally on the word translated “ onward ” or “ henceforth.” If the intention of the document were really to transform a concession which had almost expired into a lease of this valuable property at a fixed rent for all time, it is certainly surprising that such intention was not expressed with greater clearness. The principal object of the transaction appears to be the increase of the rent; the phrases relied on by Muin seem to be merely incidental, and to fall far short of a grant of the concession in perpetuity. The question of the effect of the firman was considered by a committee and discussed by the Medjliss in November 1910. It appears from the report of the committee that Muin maintained that “ he was in the right,” but was prepared to accept any general arrangement made by the Government in regard to mines. He also claimed a “ right of priority ” on the strength of the work he had done in developing the mines. This certainly appears to indicate that he was doubtful as to the strength of his case. The committee confirmed the firmans of 1312 (1895) and 1315 (1898), but declined to confirm “ for perpetuity ” the concession of 1322 (1904). They reported that the concession was not good, and recommended that the Government should keep the mines in their own hands. After considerable discussion in the Medjliss the question was adjourned for the consideration of the Cabinet. It was pointed out in the course of the discussion that there was no mention of perpetuity in the firman and that the word “ onward ” was used in every firman without thereby conferring |a perpetual grant, and it was stated that the committee were unable to conceive of such a concession being granted in perpetuity to anyone. There was some discussion as to whether the fact that no fixed period was laid down rendered the concession void, but no decision was come to on this point, although Sir E. Grey understands that there is ground for the opinion that a lease which does not specify the [2763 /—8] / * \ y C Cv : kI4F£67973 : ( 14 FEB1£1S January 6.] J Section 8.. • , j • u. a a oocordinff to Mohammedan law.

Treasury-General point out that it is erroneous to speak of Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession as having been restored to him. Under his original firman he had free disposal of the mines against payment of a small annual land tax. Under his present concession (see enclosure in Sir *G. Barclay’s despatch No. 238 of 4th December, 1911), treasurer-general regards him as agent of the Government. Muin receives 15 per cent, for his expenses in working the mines, which leaves him no profit. Messrs. Strick’s payments are made direct to treasurer-general, who, however, remits to Muin amounts sufficient to make up the 24,000L which, as } Ou are aware, he was awarded as compensation for oxide mines at the moment of his expulsion. ^ Muin is bound to fulfil conditions of Messrs. Strick s contract, which precludes the shipping of oxide to other parties. After the expiration of Messrs. Strick’s contract, Muin’s 15 per cent, is raised to 25 per cent, for “ expenses and commission,” and he is to make no contract without the knowledge of the Government. Treasurer-general does not much approve of this concession, but as an Act of Parliament he had to put it into effect, nor had he power to change its conditions, though he takes every precaution to keep Muin in firm control. He sees no practical method of safeguarding Weir and Ellinger’s interests other than that suggested in my telegram No. 24 of 19th January. . I understand from Messrs. Strick’s agent here that they are applying for six months extension of their contract to compensate for period during which their shippers were suspended last summer. The sooner, therefore, that Ellinger decide whether they will apply for a subsequent contract the better, as, though treasurer-general assures me he will not countenance any fresh departure without warning me, arrangements may be made behind his back which may place us in fresh dilemma as regards conflicting interests of British firms.

According to report from His Majesty’s consul at Bunder Abbas to His Majesty’s consul-general at Busbire, local director of customs understands that phrase “ under direct supervision, &amp;c,” only means that customs administration would see that Persian Government are not defrauded of royalties to which they are entitled under terms of concession to Muin-ut-Tujjar, and that latter carries out terms of contract between Persian Government and Strick. Administration would exercise no control over actual working of mines. If this account of situation, which does not agree with that given by you, is correct and concession has practically been handed hack to Muin, you should, unless you see objection, remind treasurer-general of our wishes, as expressed in my telegram No. 362 If director of customs at Bunder Abbas is wrong, I agree that only possible course is that indicated in your telegram, should Weir and Ellinger desire it to he adopted. of last year, and of rights of Messrs.

We are unable to assist Muin-ut-Tujjar to recover all his privileges under his original concession, to which, as it now appears, Persian Government had right to put an end. Our obligations to see that Muin is not treated unjustly only relate to Hormuz oxide, in which alone British interests are concerned up to the present, and we have no right to interfere between Persian Government and one of their own subjects in a case where no British interests are endangered. You may speak to Muin in above sense if he again approaches you, and ask him how restoration of all his privileges would affect position of Strick and Weir-Ellinger in connection with oxide and enable him to satisfy both. Enquire also whom he would propose to make parties to the arbitration for which he is anxious. _ Treasurer-General no doubt appreciates position of His Majesty’s Government. Weir-Ellinger’s interest have suffered through the withdrawal of Muin’s original concession for Hormuz oxide by Persian Government, which has prevented him from fulfilling his contracts with those firms, and latter have constantly pressed His Majesty’s Government to insist on the restoration of his rights. In the meantime, Strick, another British subject, has obtained a contract with the Persian Government, which complicates the question for His Majesty’s Government, who, however, could not in any way support Strick to the detriment of Weir-Ellinger, though they would be sorry to see a British interest suffer. We have always urged a compromise upon Weir - Ellinger, and Strick, but hitherto we have not succeeded in bringing them together. If, therefore, the conces sion is restored to Muin, it should only be on the understanding that Weir-Ellinger’s interests are safeguarded, and if Muin is unwilling to accept this condition our obliga tion to assist him wonld cease and we should not feel bound to object to a solution under which Strick and Weir-Ellinger benefited jointly to his exclusion.

YOUR telegram No. 350 Following from consul at Bushire :— Tehran, June 17, 1912, 2'50 p.m. “ Word ‘ apportion ’ was wrongly used in British vice-consul’s telegram No. 143 of 22nd May, and has led to misconception. In draft memorandum prepared and submitted to me on return to headquarters commercial adviser had suggested there might be deposits in place not covered by Muin’s concession which applicants might be encouraged to examine with a view to obtaining concessions. Independently of the above, I doubt, personally, whether there is any money in them. “As regards recognised deposits of Khanir Bostaneh, I would observe as follows, though there are only three serious competitors—(1) Strick ; (2) Ellinger ; and now (3) Greenway, of the firm of Strick, Scott, and Co.—the interests of the first and third firms are presumably identic since they amalgamated in 1910, we have thus two substantial competitors. Meanwhile, particular deposits which they are anxious to work are I group undecypherable] fall owing to controversy regarding status of Muin’s old concession, of which they form a part. “ It seems to me that if Ellinger and Strick could be got to combine, they could at once apply to Persian Government for a concession with likelihood of success. “This course 'would probably prove much more profitable to Ellinger than the present policy of pressing for Muin’s claim to deposits under the latter’s old concession, which your predecessor expressed his reluctance to support in his telegram No. 175 of 15th Maj 7 , 1911; it would also absolve us, as far as these items are concerned, from necessity of pressing Muin’s claim in the Gulf in the supposed interests of British merchants. “ From the above it will be understood that no concessions are being offered, and that an} 7 announcement by the Board of Trade would be most inconvenient.”Sir Edward Grey to Sir W.

Gentlemen, Foreign Office, April 19, 1912. WITH reference to your letters of the 22nd January and the second ultimo, relative to the shipment of red oxide from the Island of Hormuz, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that he addressed a telegram to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the 3rd February authorising him, should Muin-ut-Tujjar approach His Majesty’s Legation, to discuss the question with him, and to give him such help as might be possible. I am further to state that His Majesty’s Government would not be in a position to support a claim put forward by Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Co. should Muin, after his resumption of his concession, decline to make further shipments to that firm in accordance with their contract with the Persian Government, whereby the fulfilment of the agreement made by Muin with yourselves and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. was rendered impossible. Messrs. Strick have acted quite independently of His Majesty’s Government throughout, and have not asked for their support. With further reference to your letter of the 2nd ultimo, Sir E. Grey observes that you have failed, in reply to the enquiry contained in the communication from this Office of the 20th February, to show that any specific assurances of protection to Muin were given to him by His Majesty’s Government in connection with this matter, and have entirely failed to substantiate the very serious charges made against His Majesty’s Government of a breach of their engagements. I would remind you that the only assurances given in connection with this matter were those which were conveyed to your firm on the 18th January, 1908, on behalf of the limited liability company, the formation of which to exploit the oxide was then in contemplation, and which were confirmed to them personally on the 17th July of the same year, after the failure of that enterprise. As regards the first of these assurances, namely, that Muin’s concession had been seen at His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, and that, so far as His Majesty’s Government were aware, it was in perpetuity, I would point out that the question whether the concession was granted on those terms was for nearly two years in doubt, and that although Sir E. Grey regrets that His Majesty s Legation should have been misled by the apparent meaning of the terms in which that document was couched, his statement was qualified by the words “ so far as His Majesty s Government were aware,” and that he declines to take more responsibility in lespect of it than the words imply. The fact that the Persian Government have now offered to restore the concession to Muin does not, in Sir E. Grey’s view, constitute a proof that it was originally intended to be perpetual, and indeed, in view of the fact that the grant now made to him is limited to a term of ten years, the presumption is gather to the contrary, and jn favour of the contention that it was terminable at the will of the grantor, a contention w nc i now appears to be the correct one. _ . R As to the extent to which Muin’s commercial relations with your firm and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. entitle His Majesty’s Government to extend support or protection to him, I am to point out the only ground on which His Majesty s Govern ment can interfere between the Persian Government and one of their own su jjec s an afford the latter their support and some measure of their protection is that, as that Persian subiect has entered into commercial relations with British subjects, the interests of these are injured by an attempt to take away unjustly and without adequate reason a concession held by him. , ^ u This consideration would justify representations to the Persian Government with the object of preventing the cancellation of the concession, but it is important to remember that before such representations can be made the cancedation must be prove to be, as between the Persian Government and their subject, unjust, and that if it could be demonstrated that the concession was one which the Government had a right to ring to an end at will, the fact that such action would be injurious to the interests ol British subjects would not entitle His Majesty’s Government to press the case. [2440 t—2] ISE- 182 At the time when the concession was cancelled His Majesty s charge d’affaires at Tehran was assured that the concession had come to an end, and Muin waS) i n Mr. Marline’s opinion, unable or unwilling to prove the contrary. A serious warning was however, given to the Persian Government at the time, and has since been repeated at intervals bv His Majesty’s representatives at Tehran, against the infliction &lt;5) of any iniury on your interests and those of Messrs. Weir through the operation of the contract with Messrs. Strick. Since the time when the contract was cancelled His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to await proof from the Persian Govern ment that the concession had lapsed or from Muin that it was perpetual. Proof has been forthcoming of neither contention, and the truth now appears to be that the concession was not one m perpetuity, but was still m existence in the spung of 1910, though liable to be terminated at the wall of the grantor, the Persian Government. If this is so, it seems clear that the cancellation was, as between the Persian Government and Mum, only unjust if made at unreasonably short notice and without giving him an opportunity of making arrangements as regards ^ his contracts, while, as Muin had provided in those contracts that he was not to be liable it the Government prevented him from carrying them out, it would have been difficult for His Majesty’s Government to interfere on those grounds even at that time. However this may be, as the facts as to the nature of the concession have only been ascertained recently, when Muin was out of possession, it is clear that His Majesty’s Government could not insist on the restoration to him of his concession, still less on compensation for the oxide mined by him and sold by the Government. Both these conditions Muin has secured for himself, and it is therefore undeniable that, as already stated, he has obtained by his own unaided efforts terms more advantageous than any which the intervention of His Majesty’s Government could have secured for him. Whether, as you contend, the terms on which the concession is now offered to him are far less favourable than those of the original grant it is difficult to say, in view of the obscurity of the language of article 2 of the Bill which passed the Medjliss, as rendered in the translation forwarded by Sir G. Barclay. If the figures quoted by you in the fifth paragraph of your letter of the 15th January are correct (and of this Sir E. Grey has no means of judging), Muin would certainly lose much of the profit which would have accrued to him under the previous concession, but the fact remains that His Majesty’s Government were not in a position to secure to him the restoration of the concession at all, and that in his recent negotiations with the Persian Government he had no recourse to the assistance of His Majesty’s Legation, who, as far as Sir E. Grey is aware, heard of them for the first time when the Bill on the subject was introduced in the Medjliss. . TM® explanation must be regarded as final, in so far as the question of the obligations of His Majesty s Government towards Muin is concerned, and this depart ment cannot undertake to enter into further correspondence on this branch of the subject or to reply to further letters from you couched in the terms of your recent communications, which are based on a misapprehension of the extent of His Majesty’s Government’s obligations.

Relying upon these promises and the good faith of His Majesty’s Government, we did, in compliance with the wish expressed by His Majesty’s Government, procure from the Muin-ut-Tujjar, at a pecuniary sacrifice to himself, a contract wTdch in the absence of the promised support of His Majesty’s Government and the legation at Tehran has resulted in such disastrous loss to him. We beg to remind you that our letter of the 22nd January last still remains unanswered, and that, in common justice to the Muin-ut-Tujjar, a reply either in the affirmative or negative should be given without delay, so that he may know where he stands.

WITH reference to our letter of the 22nd ultimo, relative to the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s right to your unofficial protection in respect to the disputed Ormuz concession, Mr. M.

We should be glad to hear from you regarding this as soon as possible. Mr. Ellinger further understood from Mr. Norman that His Majesty’s Government would not support any claim on the part of Messrs.

(Limited), that they could not count upon the help of the former in support of the maintenance of their rights under this contract. We are, &amp;c. ELLINGER and Co.

Ellinger and Co. to Foreign Office.-— (Received January 17.) Sir, &lt; 28, Oxford Street, Manchester, January 15, 1912. WITH reference to your letter of the 8th January, replying to our letter of the 27th ultimo, in which complaint was made that the assurances of protection given to the Muin-ut-Tujjar by His Majesty’s Government have not been fulfilled, and that the letter from your office of the 9th ultimo intimated the decision not to extend to him this protection until the Persian Government had compelled him to accept such conditions as he can obtain without it, we note your reply that, as far as Sir Edward Grey is aware, the Muin-ut-Tujjar has not since the beginning of the dispute originated by the action of the Persian Government in deprivdng him of this concession approached His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran with any request for the intervention of His Majesty’s Government on his behalf. With all respect, we submit that we cannot be expected to accept this answer to our complaint. This reason for the withholding of the protection of His Majesty’s Government, given now, twenty-one months after the event, is not the reason which was given at the time, when it was stated that the protection was withheld on the grounds that the Persian Government had declared the concession to have lapsed in 1906 ; that Mr. Marling has seen the documents upon which the statement was based, which seemed to afford good grounds for the contention; that the Muin-ut-Tujjar had produced what professed to be a copy of the alleged firman, but that the paper was obviously worthless, and that the inference was that the signatures thereto were forged. As regards the statement, now made for the first time, that the Muin-ut-Tujjar has not approached His Majesty’s Legation with any request for the intervention of Plis Majesty’s Government on his behalf, we refer you to the contents of our letter of the 4th November and to the statements made therein, none of which have been disputed by your office as being contrary to fact, and we refer you also to the statement contained in your letter of the 8th July, 1910, to the effect that the Muin-ut-Tujjar came to the legation on the same day as Vekil-ul-Roaya, as well as twice subsequently, when he repeatedly asserted that he had documents to prove his rights, but declined to produce them; and that he was told that the legation had no wish to injure his interests, but was obliged to act in accordance with the balance of evidence, which appeared to be against him, but if he would produce proofs and not mere assertions due weight would be given to them. Your letter also states that we will observe from a perusal of the translation of the Bill passed by the Persian Medjliss, conferring on the Muin-ut-Tujjar a new concession for the exploitation of the oxide at Hormuz, and especially from its second article, whereby the Muin-ut-Tujjar receives compensation for the oxide sold while he was deprived of the concession, that he would appear to have obtained from the Persian Government by his own unaided efforts terms far more advantageous than any which the intervention of His Majesty’s Government could have secured for him. We gather from this document that the Muin-ut-Tujjar is entitled to a sum altogether of 29,100L, spread over the next five years, instead of a sum of 63,750b spread over five years dating from April 1910. If this be the correct interpretation of the document, and if these are better terms than any which the intervention of His Majesty’s Government could have secured, the action of His Majesty’s Government in inducing us, as the Muin-ut-Tujjar s agents, to procure from him the contract, on the grounds that it would afford him protection, would appear to be unjustifiable. We note that Sir Edward Grey has no objection to the communication to the Muin-ut-Tujjar of correspondence, copies of which were enclosed in oui last letter, and these have now gone forward ; and we have been careful to draw the Muin-ut-Tujjai s -9] I C. attention to tlie fact that His Majesty’s Government accept no responsibility for the expressions of opinion contained in onr letters to mm of the oOtn October last. We are also sending to the Muin-ut-lujjar an extract from yonr letter of the 8th January, in as far as it applies to his interests, and a copy ot this letter, to which we presume there will be no objection. ^ ELLINGER and Co. ^\i+~ (™) k Hi Register No. 3o6 Minute Paper. f3/; Secret Department.

As far as I think, I have always persisted in seeking this protection, not only through your mediation, but myself personally at Tehran, and I have always forced myself to act in such a manner that this protection might be granted me at the desired moment. You have assured me that if I trans acted business with an English firm the British Government would protect my rights ; but, unhappily, when the time arrived and I applied to you and to the legation, they have not kept the promises which they made, and both the Foreign Office and the legation have excused themselves, alleging that a member of the Medjliss, Vekil-el- Royaya, had stated that the firman had expired. “ In the first place, the statement of a member of the Medjliss is not a document, and especially the statement of a man like Vekil-el-Royaya, about whose misdeeds have been published long articles in the newspapers, and who only acted in this manner in order to obtain a commission. . “ In the second place, I had already deposited my firman at the legation, and this had been translated by the dragoman of the legation, who had informed the Foreign Office that the firman was in perpetuity. “ Thirdly, I protested to you that, admitting that the Foreign Office had not kept the promises which it made me, it is you whom I hold responsible for my losses, seeing that it is you wffio informed me that the protection had been piomise . “ Fourthly, if you will refer to my letter you will see that I had to submit to “ As regards your statement in your telegram that I wish to make a contract with the Persian Government in conformity with the Medjliss’s Bill, this is not a wish, but ratber submission to force, for tweaty . thl , e months for a just Government to do me justice, but unhappily I gave in at the evidence that the situation ^ as being aggravated after my stock of the value of 40,0001. had been confiscated.

You will, moreover, observe from a perusal of the translation of the Bill, handed secured for him, and that this result l as been achieved by the sacrifice of Messrs.

It therefore appears to Sir E Grey that the facts of the case as now made clear preclude the view adopted in your letter that Muin had been forced by the failure of His Majesty’s Government to fulfil their undertakings to conclude a disastrous bargain with the Persian Government. I am to state that Sir E. Grey has no objection to the communication to Muin of the correspondence, copies of which are enclosed in your letter, but that all statements as to the action of His Majesty’s Government on hypothetical circumstances must be made on your own responsibility. With reference to the other letter, relative to your own interests and those of Messrs.

YOUR telegram No. 679 of 12th December : Hormuz oxide, h] My telegram No. 435 of 9th December was, perhaps, not sufficiently explicit. There is not now any question of fraud on Muin’s part in signing original contract with Weir, but terms on which new concession has been offered to him preclude his carrying out his contract with Weir, and it is his action in accepting the concession on those terms, and so making it impossible for him to ship oxide to Weir during currency pf latter’s contract, which, in my opinion, would give rise to cause of action against him. Under clause 3 of first agreement with Weir, Muin undertook that till 1st April, 1912, no oxide should be sold or shipped by him to Europe or America except that sold to Weir. Oxide sold to Strick during that period is a breach by Muin of that agreement, and I do not think that provision in second supplemental agreement could afford a defence, since it cannot be argued that Persian Government are “raising- hindrance to shipment of oxide ” or “ in any way preventing shipping of oxide ” when shipments are being made regularly to Strick. Question whether just decision would be obtained against Muin in a Persian court is another matter. As to proposed consultation of Law Officers as to what procedure could be followed in order to subordinate claim against Muin to decision of British tribunal, it must be observed that Strick’s liability arises out of his contract with Persian Government, and, assuming that Muin has succeeded to these rights under that contract, only possible parties to suggested action are Strick and Muin, and we have no means of causing it to be brought. Moreover, Strick’s liability does not arise till Weir has substantiated claim against Muin, which it is practically certain can only be done in Persian court. Weir cannot sue Strick, and no form of action exists by which those two, Muin and Ellinger, could be joined as parties to suit so as to enable British court to ascertain their respective rights. Law Officers might be consulted on general question of whether Weir and Ellinger have claims which can be enforced against anyone, but as there may be objections of policy to pressing claims against Persian Government (see my telegram No. 435, paragraph 1), a report by Law Officers that such claims were good would not make our position easier. I still think that the suggestion made in my telegram No. 435 offers the best chance of a solution. [2329/—3]~ J ' r ' —“”'• [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [46048] Memorandum by Mr. Malkin.—(Received at Foreign Office, November 18, 1911.) Hormuz Oxide. THE persons concerned are— (a.) The Muin. (b.) Strick. (c.) Ellinger. (d.) Weir. Their respective positions now seem to be as follows :— (a.) The Muin has got the Hormuz concession for ten years from the 22nd March, 1910. We have not got the details of the bill, but it appears that the Muin has to carry out Strick’s contract, which presumably means that he takes the place of the Persian Government under Strick’s contract, and becomes the seller of the oxide to Strick. He is entitled to recoup himself for the oxide mined by him up to the 21st March, 1910, out of the sales to Strick, after which he is to keep 15 per cent, of receipts until the expiration of Strick’s contract on the 20th March, 1915. If oxide is sold beyond the 30,000 tons going to Strick, the Persian Government is to receive 75 per cent, and the Muin 25 per cent. This presumably refers to the period between the 20th March, 1915, and the 21st March, 1920. Apparently no rent is to be paid. It is clear that the Muin has done very well for himself. He has got an advan tageous concession, and compensation for the losses occasioned by the cancellation of the concession in March 1910. It is equally clear that he has entirely disregarded the interests of Ellinger and Weir, and has, in fact, “let them (or, any rate, Weir) in” very badly. (b.) Strick is also in an advantageous position. He has got a very favourable contract, which has just been confirmed, and we may assume that the Persian Govern ment, in order to prevent any claim against them by Strick, will see that the Muin carries out the contract properly. Strick has undertaken full responsibility for any lawful claim which Weir or Ellinger may have against the Persian Government or the Muin, but (apart from the question whether any such claim exists) that is a matter between Strick and the Persian Government, with which we need not concern ourselves. As far as the equities of the case are concerned, there is no doubt that Strick ought to pay some compensation to Weir and Ellinger ; he got 1,000 tons of oxide free from the Persian Government on condition that he took over their liabilities to Weir and Ellinger ; his agent advised him that the contract was very favourable to him, even if he had to discharge such liabilities, and now he is trying to wriggle out of his obligation by means of a technicality. (c) and (d.) The position of Ellinger and Weir is more complicated^ It is clear that they cannot now hope to get anything more under their contract with the Muin, and we are entitled to point out to them that the responsibility for that is finally due not to our iniquities, but to the action of the Muin in agreeing to carry out the Strick contract. Under their contract with the Muin he was to sell Whir about^ 18,000 tons of oxide, and was not during the duration of the contract to sell other oxide to Europe oi America. It appears that of this amount— 6,199 tons have been delivered and disposed of; 6,583 tons have been delivered, but not sold, owing to Strick flooding the maiket with the oxide which he got under his contract with the Persian Government. ^ ^ 5,218 tons have not been delivered, owing to the cancellation of the Mum s concession. [2253 s—21 Arr- -I | i i f : ' k? i k l ! : 111; l) : The claims for damages may thus (avoiding figures) be put as follows Weir. Difference between the price ultimately obtained for the 6,583 tons not yet disposed of, and the price which would have been ootained at the time when they would under normal circumstances have been sold. Loss on profit on the 5,218 tons not delivered. Interest, storage charges, &amp;c. Ellinger. —Loss of commission on the 5,218 tons not delivered. Loss of commission on future sales, after the expiry of Weir’s contract, which they were reasonably entitled to expect to receive for, say, five years. Interest. The question then arises from whom (if at all) are these claims recoverable. It has always been considered, since we became^ aware of the terms of the contract between the Mum, Weir, and Ellinger, that an action against the first, based solely on his failure to carry out the contract during the time when be had ceased to hold the concession, would probably fail, because he would be entitled to rely on the provision contained in article 1 of the second supplemental contract^ dated the 4th December, 1908, to the effect that “in the event of hindrance being raised by the Persian Government or their officials as to the shipment of oxide .... or should the Persian Government in any way prevent the shipping of oxide, the seller and the agents for the seller shall be in no way responsible, and the buyers shall have no right to claim any damage or demand delivery of oxide, and the seller has every right to cancel the contract . . . .” (This article would not bar an action by Ellinger for commission, because it is not under this contract that commission is payable to them ; but such an action would fail, on the ground that no money had been received by or on behalf of the Muin on which commission was due.) It has, however, always been assumed by us that one of the following alternatives must cover the facts :— (1.) At the time when the Muin entered into the contract his concession had come to an end, and he had no right to make the contract and no power to carry it out. In that case an action against him would not be barred by article 1 of the second supplemental agreement, and Weir (if not Ellinger) could recover damages from him. (2.) The Muin’s title to the concession was, when he contracted with Weir and Ellinger, good, and the Persian Government had no right to dispossess him. In that case it was considered that Weir and Eliinger would have their remedy against the Persian Government. As a result of information received from Tehran we have been strongly disposed to consider that (l) correctly represented the facts of the case, and comparatively little attention has been paid to (2), in fact we so far committed ourselves to (l) that (2) is described in a minute written on the 12th December, 1910, as an “appalling contingency which we need not contemplate till it arose. It must, however, now be admitted that (l) fails; the Persian Government have now shown that the concession had come to an end (in fact it is becoming clear that it had not) and, therefore, it will be impossible to prove that the Muin had no right to contract with Whir and Ellmger when he did. The Persian Government have practically admitted that they were wrong by restoring his concession to the Muin, and allowing him to compensate himself at their expense for the losses caused by its cancellation. / ^ f°mi a PP® a . rs , P ro ^ a ^ e ^ ia t a third alternative represents the actual facts. (3.) I le ^ Mum s concession had not come to an end when he entered into the contract, but it was not a perpetual one, but could be cancelled at any time by the eisian Government. So long as the Muin was in undisputed possession he was en it ed L o enter into contracts for a reasonable time ahead. This view is supported by the fact that in a somewhat similar case of Abu Musa Colonel Cox collected a considerable body of evidence to show that a lease which did not specify the period tor which it was granted was strictly, by Mahommedan law, bad, and could be cancelled by the lessor at any time. Under these circumstances, Sir G. Barclay suggests that a claim should be put forward against the Persian Government on the ground that, not having given the a. urn reasonable notice, they_ were bound to respect his current eno-agements, and that ttiey were warned at the time that they would be held liable In damages for any losses caused to British subjects by the cancellation of his concession.3 But whether (2) or (3) represents the facts there is a considerable objection to putting forward Weirs and Ellmger’s claims against the Persian Government In the case of Abu Musa we have taken a line, as against the German Government which is whrectly opposed to such a contention as is proposed. We contend, in that case, that Wtate A 18 n °t entit ed to put forward a claim against State B, based on the cancellation by State £ of a concession granted by it to one of its (B’s), nationals, who, on the faith of such a concession has entered into a contract with a national of State A which contract he is unable, by reason of the cancellation of the concession to carry out There are two points which distinguish the case of Abu Musa from the present 1. That in ttm Abu Musa case there was no clause in the contract barrino- an action against the concessionaires in such circumstances. 2. That we hold in the Abu Musa case that the contract was entered into by one of the concessionnaires without the consent of his partners, without which the contract was not bindihg on the firm ; so that the German claimants had a rioht of action, either against the firm or against the concessionnaire who entered into the contract without the consent of his partners. It might be possible to distinguish the case on these grounds, and argue that it is only the existence of a legal remedy against the concessionnaires in the &amp; Abu Musa case which debars the German claimants from any remedy against the State. I am not quite clear that this distinction is not sound; but it is a point which would'require very careful consideration, as it would be very awkward if the German Government heard of the contention which we should be putting forward against Persia. I do not think it would be inequitable on our part to resist the German claim and support the English ; in one case there is a legal remedy, in the other there is (so far) no remedy at all, unless we support the claim against the Persian Government. But, assuming that we could not present the claims, it appears that neither of the remedies, which we have assumed to be open to Weir and Ellinger, is applicable. It would be extremely unpleasant to have to tell them so, and they would have some reason to be aggrieved. If any way out can be found, it would be most desirable. As regards Ellinger, it seems that the recapture of the concession by the Muin has somewhat improved his position. The Muin must have an agent in England, and as Ellinger is still acting for him in other matters, there seems no reason why he should not get the oxide business. It appears that the Muin did approach Strick some time ago, but he declined, and as Strick is now the buyer of the Muin s oxide he obviously could not act as his agent. If Ellinger does get the business, it would at once eliminate his claim for 3,847L 10s. future commission after the termination of the Weir contract, and would only leave his claim for 5541. 8s. and interest being commission on the undelivered 5,218 tons. As the Muin is allowed to recoup himself from the sales to Strick for the sums wdfich he lost on this quantity, he ought to raise no objection to paying Ellinger commission on what he gets, and Ellinger’s claim would thus be disposed of. The difficulty is that Ellinger is apparently very loyal to Weir, and might decline to consent to any arrangement which did not provide for settling Weir’s claim. It seems to me that Weir has a good cause of action against the Muin, not based on the latter’s failure to carry out the contract while he was deprived of the concession, but on his action in assuming the Persian Government’s contract with Strick. He had contracted to sell 18,000 tons to Weir by the 1st April, 1912, and not to sell to anyone else (for Europe or America) during that period. Although he could not be sued if he lost the concession, it was his duty to carry out the contract when he regained it. He had power to cancel the contract under article 1 of the second supplemental agreement, but apparently he has never done so, and now it is too late. Thus Weir is entitled to damages for every ton of oxide sold by the Muin to anyone else before the 1st April, 1912. There are two objections to this course :— 1. Weir would not be entitled to damages in respect of the oxide sold by the Persian Government to Strick, unless the court held that as the Muin was entitled to recoup himself for these sales at the expense of the Persian Government, he thereby placed himself in the position of having become the seller to Strick. I he measure of Weir’s damages wuuld in any case be rather difficult to ascertain. 2. An attempt to sue the Muin in the Persian courts would probably result in a denial of justice, and though judgment might be recovered in England he probably has no property here on which execution could be levied. It might, however, be possible to„et the Persian Government to put pressure on theMuin to induce him to discharge the fnglish judgment; there is not much fear of driving him into the arms of the Germans, as he is bound to Stnck till 19X5. Jiff Ellino-er is now calling on us to stop further shipments from Hormuz vi et amis. * It is obviously advisable, if possible, to get out of having to tell him the reason why we cannot present the claims to the Persian Government. We might tell him that the whole situation has been changed by the recapture of the concession by the Mum, and that we are not responsible ‘for the unfortunate position in which they are placed hv his betrayal of their interests. We could then make the suggestion outlined above, that Ellingei should come to terms with the Muin, and Weir sue him. The only alternative I can see is to distinguish the Abu Musa case on the grounds suggested above, and press the claims on the Persian Government. This would, no doubt be more satisfactory to Weir and Ellinger, and would destroy any cause of complaint against us on their part; but it would be a somewhat dangerous course.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] Hu,. ttel L ( r ^roiste ^ THs PERSIA.

WE are in receipt of yonr letter of the 10th November, 1911, from which we note that the oxide mines at Hormuz are to be handed over to the Muin-ut-Tujjar for ten years from the 22nd March, 1910, on the condition that he carries out Messrs. Strick’s contract. We beg most energetically to protest against this arrangement, which is in flagrant contravention of all the assurances we have from time to time received from His Majesty’s Government. We must also protest against the failure on the part of His Majesty’s Government to fulfil the pledges given to us, and on the strength of which we entered into this business, and must again ask that the Persian Government be informed, without any further delay, that no shipments of oxide can be permitted from Hormuz in further disregard of our rights and while these remain unsatisfied.

Ellinger and Co. to Foreign Office.—(Received November 7.) ^ r &gt; 28, Oxford Street, Manchester, November 6, 1911 VV N beg to call your attention to the fact that the whole of the case of the Persian Government disputing the rights of the Muin-ut-Tujjar to the Hormuz concession has now collapsed, and rests, according to Sir G. Barclay’s statement, as contained in your letter of the 8th August, 1911, solely upon the interpretation of the firman of 1904! . His Majesty’s Government have interpreted this document as conferring on the Muin-ut-Tujjar rights in perpetuity, and there is no longer any reason for His Majesty’s Government to withhold from Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves the protection which was promised us, and on the strength of which the contract with the Muin-ut-Tujjar was entered into. On the 23rd January, 1911, Mr. Mallet wrote us in a letter that His Majesty’s Government would very shortly press the Persian Government in the strongest manner to produce proofs of their assertion, and that, pending the result of this step, Sir E. Grey was unable, after careful consideration of the arguments advanced by us, to modify the view expressed in a letter from your Office of the 15th December as to the prevention of shipments by others than Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. On the J5th June, 1911 (that is to say, after a lapse of six months), we addressed a letter in which we again claimed that His Majesty’s Government should notify the Persian Government that shipments of oxide by others than Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. would not be permitted. To this Mr. Mallet replied, in a letter dated the 2nd August, 1911, that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran had been instructed to present a claim to the Persian Government on our behalf and on that of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and that his attention had been drawn to the points raised in our letter of the 15th June. We have not since heard what has been done, and must again call upon His Majesty’s Government to see that the shipments by others than Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. are discontinued, pending a satisfactory settlement of the question at issue. The matter is of the utmost urgency, as the stock of oxide which Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. now hold in this country is reduced to exceedingly small dimensions, and there can be no doubt that, unless steps are immediately taken, shipments from Hormuz will be resumed.

Mr. Langley further wrote us on the 20th July, 1910, that the Vekil-ul-Boaya’s contention was that the firman of 1904 did no more than alter some and confirm others of the provisions of the firman granted in 1895, but did not extend it, and, further, that the Mum-ut-Tujjar had produced what professed to be a copy of the alleged firman, but that tlje paper was obviously worthless, and the inference was that the sierna- tures were forged. &amp; . The Muin-ut-Xujjar was told when he came to the legation that the balance of evidence appeared to be against him, and that he must produce proofs. His Majesty s Government at this stage stated it to be their opinion, from all the evidence available, that the concession appeared to have lapsed at an earlier date. Mr. Langley, in the same letter of the 20th July, in a resume of the position, writes to us :— “ There is as yet no absolute conclusive evidence to show whether the contention of the Persian Government or that of the Muin is valid, but the balance of evidence is distinctly in favour ot the former, since Muin consistently refuses to produce the docu ments by which, as he asserts, he could establish his rights, and thus declines to take the step by which, if he is telling the truth, the controversy could at once be ended in his favour.” On the 7th March, 1911, Mr. Langley writes us that Sir George Barclay could not say what proof the Persian Government could produce of their contention that the lease was revocable at will except that afforded by an assertion that their action was taken in virtue of their sovereign rights and in conformity with religious law and with custom. He accordingly proposed to ask for an opportunity to inspect the different firmans bearing on the case, and made the application, but was informed in reply that the Persian Government were not in possession of copies of the original lease and firman, and that it was in the absence of these documents that the firman of 1904 was granted in confirmation of the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s lease. You will thus see that the Muin-ut-Tujjar was originally condemned and refused the protection to which he was entitled, and of which he had been assured by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, on the ground that he would not produce the original firman of 1895, and that later this protection was still withheld on the same ground, although the Persian Government were also unable to produce the firman in question, and had stated that the firman of 1904 had been granted because the original firman was not in existence. We may here point out that it is not strange that the Muin-ut-Tujjar could not produce the firman of 1895, seeing that the Persian Government could not produce it, nor His Majesty’s Legation, who had been present at an investigation of the Muin-ut- Tujjar’s rights under that firman as against those of Messrs. Malcolm under a finnan which they held, and had sanctioned a decision favourable to the Muin. It now appears from the concluding paragraph of Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 8th August, 1911, that the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s rights to the concession rest entirely on the interpretation of the firman of 1904 and no other, and we must here respectfully point out that His Majesty’s Government are in a better position to interpret the document impartially than either the Persian Government or the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and that they, at a time when there was no dispute or question, and after they had seen the firman CO D Y ! N| MA 26 JAN 1912 SECRETARY’S N2 4 A'oL: u; 25 JAM 914 -2 and rescript at the legation, put on them a construction favourable to the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and gave us assurances as to the perpetuity of the mum s rights for confidential use in direct relation to very important financial operations. . We beo- to remind His Majesty s Government or the promises of support v have been given from time to time to the Main and to us as his agents. As far back as the 8th October, 1906, the late Sir E. Gorst wrote that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran would take such unofficial action as he properly could, to assist the Muin-ut-Tujjar in case of' foreign interference with its concession, and would write a letter to the Muin-ut-Tujjar to this effect. J „ On the 16th June, 1908, we wrote asking for assurances that the transfer from Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. would not interfere with the benevolent support which the Muin-ut-Tujjar had been allowed to understand he would receive from His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran, in case of foreign interference with his concession at Hormuz; and on the 17th July Sir F. A. Campbell wrote usjthat as long as the enterprise remained in British hands, and we continued to fulfil the conditions subject to which the support of His Majesty’s Government was originally promised to us, we would continue to receive that suppoit through His -Majesty s Legation at Tehran. Mr. Mallet further wrote us on the 14th September, 1908, that m the course of a report received from Mr. Marling he expressed the opinion that the Muin-ut-Tujjar suspects that one reason for the warm interest which His Majesty’s Government are displaying in this question is that they are seeking to induce him to place his Hormu^ concession so far under British protection that the legation will be able to use its position to bring pressure to bear on him in other matters in which there are British interests opposed to his own, and that if we could disabuse the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s mind of this suspicion, which Mr. Mallet states is of course quite unjustified, the chief difficulty in the way of retaining the trade in British hands would be removed. We pointed out in our reply dated the 24th September that, whilst we had told the Muin-ut-Tujjar, in the identical words used by Mr. Marling, that His Majesty’s Government would not and could not in respect of other questions make any improper use of the position of dependency in which the Muin-ut-Tujjar might be placed as regards the oxide company, and that His Majesty’s Government had also satisfied us that any promise of protection made in respect ot this business w'ould not he used to bring pressure to bear upon him in other matters where his interests conflicted with those of other British subjects, notably with those of Messrs. Lynch, it appeared to us that if the Muin really entertained such suspicions, as we believed he did, His Majesty’s representative on the spot, and he alone, would be able to reassure him, to which Sir F. A. Campbell on the 30th September replied, that although Sir Edward Grey was of opinion that our firm was in a better position to reassure the Muin as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards him than His Majesty’s charge d’affaires, the latter would not, however, lose sight of the views expressed in our letter of the 24th September. In the summer of 1908, in view of the difficulties encountered in the formation of the company which had been projected, the late Mr. Wilson Fox tried to bring about a contract with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. He wrote from Norway to Mr. Ellinger, on the 5th August :— “ If the proposed contract for the Muin-ut-Tujjar breaks down, you will let the Foreign Office know at once. I greatly hope you will be able to smooth away the difficulties and complete the contract between Messrs. Strick and the Muin.” On the 10th August Mr. Ellinger wrote to the late Mr. Wilson Fox that the pioposed contract with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. had fallen through, and suggested that the best thing would be to go ahead with the formation of the company. On the 10th August Mr. Mallet wrote to Mr. Ellinger that he was much surprised to hear that Messrs. Strick and Co. refused to go on with the negotiations, and that it was very disappointing after all the trouble taken by Mr. Wilson Fox and Sir R. Ritchie we should not have been able to come to terms. , . 0n , mh August the late Mr. Wilson Fox wrote to Mr. Ellinger that His ajestys Government would prefer the matter to go through in the form of a contract \wt i i lessrs. Strick and Co., if possible ; and in another letter of the same date he wrote as follows :— I trust that you will use every endeavour to come to terms with Mr. Strick. are y }ou can smooth over the difficulties? They cannot be insuperable. I hold a verystrong opinion that a contract between the Mum and Mr. Striek for two and a-half years is the best policy, and we can consider the company question later on. Pray make a serious effort again to get a contract through. If I can be of any use, wire to me here *&gt;nd I will return.” We further wrote op the 18th November that we had heard from the Muin that a British firm was negotiating with the Persian Legation in London for the purchase of the concession from the Persian Government, and that we presumed that we would be quite correct in informing the Muin-ut-Tujjar that so long as the sale of the oxide was in our hands, no application to the British Government by any other British subjects for the grant of the concession of the Island of Hormuz, and consequent confiscation of the concession now held in perpetuity by the Muin-ut-Tujjar would receive the support of His Majesty’s Government here or the British Legation in Tehran, to which we received a reply on the 25th November from Mr. Langley, stating that we would be quite in order in giving the Muin-ut-Tujjar this assurance. We further wrote to the late Mr. Wilson Fox on the 20th November that, in accordance with the suggestion made by Sir Richmond Ritchie at the last interview, we had pointed out to the Muin-ut-Tujjar that although he could rely upon the absolute protection of his property in the event of a company being formed and upon the benevolent protection of the British Government during the currency of a bond fide contract, he could not count upon our being able to induce His Majesty’s Government to protect him, should the necessity arise, if we based our application upon a contract made after the urgency had arisen and having the appearance of being made for the purpose of securing this protection. It is thus quite clear that the Muin-ut-Tujjar was fully led to rely upon the benevolent protection of His Majesty’s Government and the assistance and support of His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran in the maintenance of his rights and of his concession as interpreted already by them, so long as we retained the trade in British hands, and that this protection would not be withdrawn nor pressure be brought to bear upon him because his interests might be in conflict with those of other British subjects. All this, however, we regret to say His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran appears to have entirely overlooked from the commencement of the controversy which arose early in 1910 in this matter. We were informed at the outset, and we were compelled to agree, that if it could be shown, as His Majesty’s Government assured us, contrary to their previously expressed opinion, they believed to be the case, that the Muin-ut-Tujjar at the time of making his contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves was not entitled to the concession, and was now basing his claim to the same upon forged documents, we would not be able to enlist the support of His Majesty’s Government in upholding the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s position. But, as it now appears that the belief then expressed by His Majesty’s Government as to the outcome of the investigation was not correct, and that the whole question turns upon the interpretation of the firman of 1904, we now can and do claim as the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s agents the support and protection which was promised to him. We must point out that the support of His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran appears to have been withheld from the Muin-ut-Tujjar prior to the receipt ot the information given by Vekil-ul-Roaya. On the 27th August, 1908, we were informed by Mr. Mallet that a telegram had just been received from the charge d’affaires at Tehran, reporting that there existed^ a serious danger that the Persian Government might attempt to raise money by cancelling the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession and selling a similar concession to somebody else for a term of years, and on the 31st August, 1909, Mr. Mallet wrote that the existence of the contract with Messrs. Andrew Whir and Co. had been kno wn for some time past to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co , and that the obligation to maintain secrecy as to the contract was a source of difficulty to Sir Geo. Barclay in endeavouring to prevent the cancellation of the Mum’s concession. He also stated that these concessions appear to be an imminent danger, and that Sir G. Barclay, by Sir E. Grej 7 s instinotions, was doing all he could on the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s behalf. Sir F. A. Campbell wrote further on the 16th September that Sir Geo. Barclay was of opinion that the Muin had come to terms with tee committee m legalci to his concessions. Now, in the spring of 1910, when the concession was actually confiscated and the oxid^ sold to Messrs. F. C. Stride and Co., no such warning was given to us, altnough.•am 1 ‘g* 1 in view of what had been previously communicated to us in the letter of the 3 1st August 1909, to which we have just referred, it is impossible to suppose that what was beinff done was not fully known to His Majesty’s Government. On the 8th July, 1910, when _ the Muin-ut-Tujjar called at the legation b»- Tehran, he was told that the legation had no wish to injure his interests, hut wa?&lt; obliged to act in accordance with the appearance of facts, which appeared to be against him, but if he would produce proofs and not mere assertions, due weight would be given to them. Whereas, in all fairness and justice, he was entitled to receive from the legation promises of support and assistance instead of being held at arm’s length and assumed to be in the wrong. We beg to point out that the firman of 1904 on which His Majesty’s Government based their assurances as to the perpetuity of the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s rights has been in the possession of the legation in Tehran since the end of 1908. We cannot agree that the interpretation of this firman hangs solely on the meaning of the Persian word translated as “ henceforth,” and we maintain that, upon a fair reading of the whole document, no reasonable ground can be shown for altering the interpretation originally, and, as we submit rightly, put upon it by His Majesty’s Government. It is for the Persian Government to prove their case, and, in the absence of such proof, we respectfully call upon His Majesty’s Government to fulfil their pledges and to grant to the Muin-ut-Tujjar that protection and support which he and we, his agents, had been led to expect he would receive in time of need. We wish particularly to say that this letter is written by us only as agents of the Muin-ut-Tujjar and in his interests, and is entirely distinct from our communications relating to the rights of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves. We are, &amp;c. ELLINGEIt a.nd Co.V. ]%\&gt; CONFIDENTIAL. p'i-x Put away with S huJ ^sei sn 1 ® ODljjj; distinct fe Co, aiio® ME .la Sir G.

Muin refuses to pay any compensation to Whir and Ellmger, unless m pursuance of a judgment in some court of justice or of an arbitral award, as provided for in article 14 of his contract with them, though in either of these cases he would, I gather, resist payment until he had recovered the amount from Strick. He denies that a claim against him is not barred by supplementary agreement, as he contends that the terms of his concession absolutely preclude the shipment of oxide to Messrs. Weir during the currency of the Persian Government’s contract with Strick, and constitute as effective a hindrance to it, on the part of the Persian Government, as his actual dispossession. He professes his personal indifference as to whether he ships to the one firm or to the other. As you have decided that the claim against the Persian Government cannot be pressed, and that there is no procedure by which the matter might be referred to the British law courts in the first instance, I think that the only practical courses are that Messrs. Weir and Ellinger should submit this dispute with Muin to arbitration, as provided for in article 14, or that some compromise should be arrived at. I might, for instance, endeavour to obtain an undertaking from Muin and the Persian Government that after the expiration of Messrs. Strick’s contract Messrs. Weir and Ellinger should be given the option of a similar contract, while you might prevail on Strick to compensate in some degree for this delay in their profits by paying to them at least the value of the 1,000 tons of oxide which he has received gratis from the Persian Government in consideration for the indentures he has undertaken.

We trust that this may result soon in the satisfaction of our rights, but we cannot refrain from expressing surprise that in the last eighteen months, during which the rights of Messrs Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, which His Majesty’s Government was pledged to the hilt to protect, have been set aside by the Persian Government as of no importance, His Majesty’s Government has not found it possible to ascertain the actual facts of the situation, which are so painfully clear to us. We further note that it is impossibleTo~stop further shipments of oxide except by the use of force, and that Sir Edward Grey is of opinion that such action on the part of His Majesty’s Government is quite out of the question. We induced our friends, Messrs.

Andrew Weir and Co., we feel we must put on record, in view of the statement now made to us that force cannot be used to secure the fulfilment of one of the obligations into which His Majesty’s Government entered, that there is nothing in the correspondence between us to show that His Majesty’s Government has tried by friendly representations, or by other means not involving the use of force, to procure that which we asked and which His Majesty’s Government promised us should be done.

WE beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant relative to the Ormuz question. Your letter refers to our communications of the 30th October, and 4th, 6th, 13th, and 29th ultimo, but to avoid confusion we propose here to deal only with the matters mentioned in ours of the 30th October and the 4th and 29th ultimo, which we addressed to you in the Muin’s interests and in our capacity as his agents ; and we will deal in a separate letter with the matters referred to in ours of the 6th and 13th ultimo, which concern the interests of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves. Our letter to you of the 30th October covered extracts of letters we propose to send to the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and, as these contained not only references to the communications which had passed between His Majesty’s Government and ourselves, but an expression of opinion on our part that the Muin-ut-Tujjar could make any use of them he thought fit, it appeared to us only courteous before dispatching these letters to give His Majesty’s Government, as we had previously done in similar circumstances, an opportunity of expressing their views on what we intended writing. We maintain that His Majesty’s Government have undertaken certain obligations towards the Muin-ut-Tujjar which are not being fulfilled, and we set out at length in our ^ letter of the 4th ultimo the grounds upon which, in our opinion, the Muin-ut- Tujjar was entitled to rely upon receiving the benevolent protection of His Majesty’s Government in this matter. If we now correctly understand the meaning of your letter of the 9th December, Sir Edward Grey, without in any way disputing the accuracy of the statements in our letter of the 4th instant, or the interpretation we have put upon the facts as stated, now definitely informs us that he will not decide to extend to Haji Agha Mohammed Muin-ut-Tujjar the protection which we maintain has been promised to him, until the Persian Government have had the unrestricted opportunity of compelling him to accept irrevocably what he can get without the protection upon which we, by direct request of His Majesty’s Government, led him to rely, and by so doing induced him to enter into the contract which, he maintains, has cost him his concession. We have sent to the Muin-ut-Tujjar the correspondence up to the 31st March last, and we shall now be pleased to hear at your earliest convenience if you have any objection to our sending him further correspondence which has passed between us in reference to his interests.

WITH reference to your telegram No. 361 of the 20th November, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of the Bill conferring on Muin-ut-Tujjar certain rights in connection with the mining of Hormuz oxide. No agreement in accordance with article 8 has as yet been executed between the Ministry of Public Works and the Muin-ut-Tujjar. I understand that Mr. Shuster disputes the validity of the law, principally on account of the absence of his imprimatur to it, which he claims is necessary under the law, defining the attributes of the treasurer-general. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Bill passed by the Mcdjliss at the Sitting of November 2, 1911, in regard to the lease of Hormuz Oxide. (Translation.) ARTICLE 1. The Government hands over to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar the mine of oxide of iron which is in the Isle of Hormuz, for ten solar years from the beginning of Hammal It II, 1328 (22nd March, 1910), on the condition that all undertakings which, in accordance with a separate contract, were arrived at on the 16th Zighedeh, 1328 (19th November, 1910), between the previous Cabinet and Mr. Strick should be fully carried out by Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar during its term, which is five solar years, and that should he act m a manner contrary to the articles of the said contract so as to cause a loss to the Government, he shall have to make good any losses occasioned to the Government. Art. 2. The Government undertakes that from any quantity of soil which may be over and above the 13,000 tons of the oxide of iron now ready belonging to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar, which it bought and gave him an order of payment for the sum of 24,000Z. to be realised by him as against the value of 11,294 tons of soil, up to the amount of 30,000 tons of soil which in accordance with the contract must be delivered to Mr. Strick, to pay Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar 15 per cent, for the expenses of excavation, on condition that should the soil now ready belonging to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar be less than 13,000 tons he should pay the Government for the deficit up to 13,000 tons at forty-two shillings and a half per ton, and that should the soil now ready be more than 13,000 tons Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar will not claim the price of the surplus. Art. 3. Hajji Muiu-ut-Tujjar, after deducting the 13,000 tons, is bound to pay the Government the remaining cost of the soil purchased by Mr. Strick until the expiration of Mr. Strick’s contract, and in case the appointed instalments should not be met, the Government will be able to revoke this contract. Art. 4. If until the expiration of the Government’s contract with Mr. Strick, which is for the first five years, Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar should, during this period, sell anything over and above the 30,000 tons to him or to any other body, he will pay 75 per cent, of the cost of the soil to the Government. Art. 5. After the expiration of Mr. Strick’s contract, any quantity of soil which may be excavated from the said isle, 75 per cent, of the cost of the same will be the Government’s share, and 25 per cent, of it will belong to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar for the expenses and his commission. Art, 6. All transactions which Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar may within the period of ten years do with anyone in regard to the red soil of oxide of . iron must be with the Government’s information.

The contract for the excavation of the oxide mine on the Isle of Hormuz for a period of ten years, which contains eight ar tic|es, was, at the sitting of 10th Zigkedeh, which corresponds with the 9th Agrab, 1329 (2nd November, 1911), passed by a majority of thirty-four votes. gEIN President of the National Consultative Assembly.

Foreign Office to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. Gentlemen, Foreign Office, December 9, 1911. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 30th October and the 4th, 6th, 13th, and 29th ultimo, relative to the question of the shipment of red oxide from Hormuz. It appears from a telegram received on the 4th instant from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that, while the Bill providing for the restoration of the Hormuz oxide concession to Muin-ut-Tujjar has passed the Medjliss, no agreement executing its \ provisions has yet been made between Muin and the Minister of Public Works. Sir E. Grey is, therefore, disposed to think that Muin has not yet decided whether he will accept the concession on the terms offered by the Persian Government, and feels that, until the decision arrived at by Muin is ascertained, he is not in a position to give any advice with regard to the claims of Messrs. Weir and Co. and yourselves, or to undertake responsibility for any statements you may desire to make to Muin in reply to his recent letters. The position of your claim, and that of Messrs. Weir and Co., is receiving most careful consideration, and when the actual facts of the situation have become clear a further communication will be made to you. I am, however, to point out to you that it is impossible to stop further shipments of oxide except by the use of force, and that such action on the part of His Majesty s Government is, of course, quite out of the question.

As this matter has lasted for a long time, it would be good if you would do your best to complete the affair as early as possible. With the information which has been sent to the Minister for Persia when the matter was referred to him, I believe that same could be settled more quickly. If Messrs. Strick will not go to the tribunal, and if our legation informs the Minister for Foreign Affairs of this, perhaps the Persian Government will prevent other ship ments until the matter is settled definitely. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract of Letter dated October 7, 1911, from the Muin-ut-Tujjar to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. THE Chamber of Ministers has sent a proposal to the Medjliss to entrust to me the oxide mines of Hormuz on certain conditions, and we are awaiting the decision now of the Medjliss. Perhaps I shall be able to obtain from the Government the authorisation to cancel the contract of Messrs. Strick and Co., on the grounds that they have not fulfilled their engngement, as they have not settled your claim as they had promised. But certainly in that case the Government will make me responsible for the consequences. As I have sent to you a copy of the contract of Messrs. Strick, I beg to ask you if in your opinion the Government or myself can cancel the contract 'without undergoing the consequences of my claim of Messrs. Strick ? Besides this, do you believe that your Foreign Office, now, as it is convinced that this concession has been taken from me unjustly, and that Messrs. Strick have been the cause of it, will reject all claims raised by Messrs. Strick, in case their contract is cancelled ?

October 30, 1911. ^VE are in receipt of* your two letters of* the Tth instant, and, with reference to the shorter of the two letters, we note that the Cabinet Ministers have put a proposi tion before the Medjliss to entrust to you again the oxide mines at Hormuz, subject to certain conditions, which we trust will be satisfactory. We note, further, that you may be able to obtain from the Government authority to cancel the contract with Messrs. Strick on the grounds that they have not fulfilled their engagements, m so far as they have not regulated our claims as they had under taken to do, and that in this case the Government would certainly hold you responsible for the consequences. In reply to your question whether Messrs. Strick and Co. could nave recourse against the JPersian Government or yourself m the e\ent of their contract being can celled, we beg to state that our legal advisers have unhesitatingly expressed the opinion that Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. can have no right of action against the Persian Government, nor could they enforce any legal claim against you in respect of a contract between the Persian Government and themselves to which you were no party. With reference to the following paragraph of your letter, we regret to say that we have not yet succeeded in securing an admission from our Foreign Office that your concession has been unjustly taken away, but His Majesty’s Government contends, on the other hand, that the question has not yet been proven by either the Persian Government or yourself. With reference to the enquiry contained in this paragraph of your letter as to whether Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. could obtain the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in support of a claim for the cancellation of their contract with the Persian Government, we have no hesitation in saying that His Majesty’s Government are under every conceivable moral obligation to see that our rights and those of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. under the contract between us and you are not interfered with. We must further point out that they have previously promised to give you all the protection they unofficially can in relation to this concession. We also draw your attention to our letter to the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the 9th December, 1910, in which we wrote :— “ It has been intimated that His Majesty’s Government must preserve an even balance between two British subjects, but we have to point out that there is no question of equality of treatment of ourselves and Messrs. Strick in this matter if the Muin-ut- Tujjar’s concession cannot be shown to have lapsed. Mr. Strick’s oxide contract with the Persian Government was made long after the contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., with full knowledge of the existence of the contract between the Muin-ut- Tujjar and this firm and of the risk he was running should the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s right to the concession be established, and after being twice told he could not rely upon the support of His Majesty’s Government, who were pledged to support us, and we venture to submit without hesitation that from first to last the whole sequence of events shows that upon a conflict of interests Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves are, upon every principle of fairness, entitled to ask for this support in preference to any claims of Mr. Strick, based, as his are, and can only be, upon a contract which he knew to be made in violation of the Muin-ut-Tujjar concession.” To this letter the Foreign Office replied on the 15th December, 1910, and in reference to the paragraph we have just cited w r rote :— As regards your second request, I am to observe that it is quite true that Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. have acted in this matter with full knowledge of the circumstances of the case and of the risk of loss to themselves which would be involved in a failure on the part of the Persian Government to prove that the Muin-ut-Tujjar s concession lapsed^ as they assert. Messrs. Strick are also aware of the undertakings given by His Majesty s Government to yourself and to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and have themselves never received or even solicited any promise of support.” We again wrote to the Foreign Office on the 5th January, and our letter contains the following sentence : — 5)“ Both the Persian Government and Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. were distinctly warned by His Majesty’s Government—the former, that they would be held responsible for any injury to British interests, and the latter, that His Majesty’s Government were •pledged to support the contract with the Muin-ut-Tujjar.” In face of this, it is quite clear to us that His Majesty’s Government would under no circumstances assist Messrs. Strick and Co. in putting forward any claim for damages consequent upon the Persian Government doing any act which would have for its effect the reinstatement of yourself in the rights of your concession and of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves in the rights of our contract. The letters from which we have quoted you extracts have been sent to you by permission of His Majesty’s Government, and there can be no doubt that you are entitled to make any use you think fit of their contents. There are, moreover, other reasons why His Majesty’s Government could not give support to any claim of this description as against you. Yon will doubtless recollect that when the possibility was under discussion of the formation of an English limited company for the working of this oxide business, in an interview between Mr. Marling and yourself the former told you that once the company was formed the legation would be legally bound to give it its best protection, and that so long as there were British shareholders in the concern you could trust them at all events to see that their interests were properly cared for. Mr. Marling further told you that you had had dealings for many years with us, and if you had the same confidence m us that we reposed in you, you need feel no uneasiness, but that we would safeguard your just interests to the best of our ability, and see that the concern obtained the assistance and protection to which, as a British company, it would be entitled at the hands of His Majesty’s Government. It is quite true that the company was never formed, but as the contract was made instead of the company, and pending its formation, with the full knowledge and consent of His Majesty’s Government, who gave assurances of protection, there is no doubt in our mind of the binding nature of the assurances given to you by Mr. Marling, nor, indeed, does His Majesty’s Government repudiate the obligation to protect the contract. We, moreover, wrote you at the time that His Majesty’s Government would not and could not, in respect of other questions, make any improper use of the position of dependency in which you might be placed as regards the oxide company, but that His Majesty’s Government has also satisfied us that any promise of protection made in respect of this business would not be used in bringing pressure to bear upon you in other matters where your interests conflict with those of other British subjects. This assurance was given to you upon the highest authority, and you will be quite safe in assuming that His Majesty’s Government will not support, as against you, any claim such as that in question. We are, &amp;c. ELLINGEB and Co. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Extract of Letter from Messrs. Ellinger and Co. to the Muin-ut-Tujjar, dated October 30, 1911. WE reply in this letter to the longer of your two letters of the 7th instant. We note the view expressed to you by the Minister that as Messrs. Strick have taken on themselves to answer all our legal claims in this matter (by which we understand you to mean our claim) has to be referred to arbitration [sic], and that a tribunal must decide whether we have or have not a legal right. We note also that the Minister’s view appears to have been favourably regarded by you, and that you would wish us to act in the way suggested. We must point out at once that the Minister’s suggestion is founded upon a totally mistaken view of our position. Messrs. Strick have nothing to do with our claim, and no contract between them and the Persian Government can have anything to do with our rights. Our Foreign Office have all through recognised that our contract was entered into with the active support of His Majesty’s Government, and that they are pledged to support our claim against the Persian Government if that Government actedwrongly and otherwise against you. ^Whether the Persian Government can fall back upon Mr. Strick in the event of our claim being made good against them is a matter that does not concern us in any way, and we could not allow any question regarding our rights tc be dealt with m any arbitration 01 by 3&gt;ny tribunal, whose only duty could be ^ascertain whether the Persian Government are entitled to any protection asfij between themselves and Messrs.

I find it difficult to share your view that the ultimate decision of a British court does not concern His Majesty’s Government, as the arguments on which that decision would be founded might possibly directly stultify those used by the legation in enacting the claims, whether against Muin or the Persian Government, to the serious disadvantage ot our reputation for just dealings.

This should render Muin amenable to suggestion that Weir’s rights must be safeguarded by compensation from Muin or otherwise.

Ultimate ground of all the claims appears to me to be dispossession of Muin-ut- Tujjar by Persian Government (a proceeding which, however justified it may have been in fact, they have so far failed to defend convincingly in any communication which they have addressed to His Majesty’s Legation up to the present), because if Muin had ' not been dispossessed his contract with Weir and Ellinger would in all probability not j have been broken. Had contract not been broken, Muin would doubtless have continued to employ Ellinger as his agent; he would have gained no advantage by ceasing to do so. The two bases of claim are really the same, and itjappears undesirable, therefore, to ] put in Ellinger’s claim for loss of agency in a separate note.

Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 28.) (No. 192.) Sir, v Tehran, October 12, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch No. 183 of the 2nd October, transmitting a copy of the note which I addressed to the Persian Government presenting the claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger arising from the dispossession of Muin-ut-Tujjar from the Hormuz oxide mines, I have the honour to enclose herewith a translation of the note which I have now received from the Persian Government in reply. The Persian Government maintain that the firman of 1904, by not fixing a period for the duration of Muins lease, left them the right of cancelling it at any moment. I think it would be difficult seriously to dispute this pretension of the Persian Government, especially in the case of one of its own subjects. But as the contract with Messrs. Weir and Ellinger was made before the lease was cancelled, and was only for such a reasonable period ahead as was required by the exigencies of commerce, we can very fairly contend that the Government, on taking possession, should have carried out the provisions of the contract as I called upon them to do in my notes to the Persian Government of the 11th and 12th April, 1910. It is true that, if we admit the legality of the Persian Government’s action, their second argument, founded on the terms of Muin’s supplementary agreement (No. 3, in enclosure in Messrs. Ellinger and Co.’s letter to the Foreign Office of the 26th July, 1910), has to be met. I think, however, that it may be pointed out that this agreement merely relieves Muin from personal liability for damages, and does not relieve the Persian Government from their obligation to carry out the bond fide engagements of Muin existing at the time he was summarily ejected. When this question was first discussed it was assumed by the Foreign Office that either Muin entered fraudulently into his contract with Messrs. W eir and Ellinger, or that the Persian Government acted illegally in dispossessing him. I think that it is now clear that neither of these assumptions is necessarily correct, but that Muin, so long as he was in undisputed possession under his indefinite firman, was entitled to make reasonable contracts, especially with the proviso contained in the supple mentary agreement, and that the Persian Government were equally entitled to cancel his lease when they pleased. They should, however, in lieu of reasonable notice being given, have respected Muin’s current engagements, and their third argument, that the contract should have been countersigned by the Government, falls to the ground, as the absence of this formality does not, according to the Commercial Ireaty of lurco- manchai, invalidate the contract of the defendant; in this case Muin acknowledges his signature. Moreover, by my note of the 8th August, 1909, the Persian Government, some time before the actual cancelling of the lease, were warned of the existence of the contract. The supplementary agreement to which the Persian Government attach importance was equally devoid of the formality in question. The rest of the Persian Government’s note deals with the question of^ Messrs. Strick’s responsibility under article 12 of their contract for any legal claim arising from the non-fulfilment of Messrs. Wbir and Elhnger’s contract, and hints that if Messis. Strick do not meet this responsibility, their contract will also be treated as null and void. _ &gt; . It will thus be seen that, while not disputing the right of the Persian Government to dispossess Mum when they did, it would still not be difficult to make out a good case for the claim for compensation on account of the violation of Muins contiact vith Messrs. Weir and El linger, yet if I restrict my arguments to those advanced above, there remains little or no justification for the additional claim of Messrs. Ellinger 101 the sum of 3,4871 10s. for loss of agency. This claim, I take it, can only be based on the illegality or Muin’s dispossession, and insistence on this point would be, I ventme to think, deeply resented by the Persian Government, and thus Vie prejudicial to futuie dealings between them and British firms of all kinds. [2219 ee —2] t COPY TO INDIA | SP.OflStAflY'a2 In these circumstances, I have the honour to request your instructions as to the reply which I should make to the Persian Grovernment. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, September 30, 1911. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 9th September last respecting the claims of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger in connection with the oxide of the Hormuz mines. In reply, I have the honour to draw the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the point that the Persian Government, by not fixing the terms in the firman of the year 1904, had reserved to itself the right of cancelling the lease of the Hormuz mines at any moment, and it has been for the same reason that the Muin-ut-Tujjar, in making the contract, has, by separate documents, made conditions with the above-mentioned firms to the effect that, should the Government make such changes in the administration of the Hormuz mines which might define or abolish the Muin’s control over them the contract would be cancelled and the firms would have no right to claim compensation. The acceptance of these conditions by the firms in question points to the fact that they have been aware of the right of the Government to cancel the firman at any time. It was necessary that the firms should have done this business with the knowledge of the Persian Government and have their contracts countersigned by the Government. Having failed to respect this point, which would have strengthened their contract, and having had no dealings with the Government in this connection, the firms cannot bring any claims which might be allowed by His Majesty’s Government to be enforced against the Persian Government, which has legally cancelled the lease held by its own lessee and its own subject. By article 12 of their contract, Messrs. Strick undertake full responsibility for meeting the legal claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger, so that no loss may be incurred by the Government or the Muin-ut-Tujjar in connection with this case. On the 5th July last the Persian Legation in London warned Messrs. Strick that if in twenty days the claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger are not put an end to Messrs. Strick would be responsible for damages. If the British Government consider the claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger legal, they must also hold Messrs. Strick responsible for their settlement. If the British Government do not consider the claims legal, why should they prefer them against the Persian Government ? Your Excellency has considered the responsibility of Messrs. Strick and the claims of W eir and Ellinger to be two different questions, and has stated in the note under reply that “any counter-claims which the latter consider they have to make on this head against Messrs. Si rick and Co. is a matter for separate settlement between the Persian Government and that firm.” In reply, I |have the honour to state that this is not a claim which could be settled between the Imperial Government and Messrs. Strick, but it is^ a full responsibility incurred by that firm in connection with the business in question, and they are bound to get it settled. In case Messrs. Strick fail to meet their responsibility, the business entered into by them will be null and void. . ' Y ' iew above circumstances, I have full confidence in your Excellency’s sense or j 'Mice that you will admit the observations made by the Persian Government, and that you will inform your Government accordingly.

Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co for the exclusive supply of red oxide from the island of Hormuz. His Majesty’s Government understand that the Muin-ut-Tujjar held a concession PnorN- mUZ mmeS granted b y a fn ' man da ted 1895, and for a period of ten years, in 1J04 this concession appears to have been confirmed by a further firman for an indefinite period. \\ ithout prejudice to the question as to^whether or no the Persian Government had the right at all to dispossess Muin of his concession, His Majesty’a Government consider that the terms of the second firman, together with the fact that Muin was in mdisputed possession in 1908, justified British firms in entering at that date into a contract with Muin for the exclusive purchase of oxide for a reasonable period ahead. The same consideration applies to the firm undertaking the duties of agency with its responsibilities, and outlay as regards business engagements reaching into the future. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the British firms concerned had every right to^ expect respectively that their contract would be respected and their agency maintained The Persian Government have, however, failed to protect these legitimately acquired British interests, and consequently, in pursuance of the warnings given to the Persian Government, I have the honour, under the instruction of IBs Majesty’s Government, to claim as compensation for damages arising from the arbitrary dispossession of Muin-ut-Tujjar and the breach of his engagement the sum of 26,053L 12s. IGd. on behalf of Messrs. Weir and Co., and of 4,(MIL 18s. on behalf of Messrs. Ellinger and Co., as tabulated in the accompanying statement, which also indicates certain sums which will fall to be deducted from the first-named claim. The amount of these claims is, however, only reckoned up to the 1st October, 1910 ; the contract between Muin and Messrs. Weir and Ellinger would not have expired until the 31st March, 1912, and until that date the realisation on favourable terms of the stocks of oxide held by Messrs. Weir is prejudiced by the continuance of shipments by another firm. Consequently I am instructed to warn your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government will be obliged to present a supplementary claim to the Persian Government which, in addition to the further damages suffered by the British firms, will also include interest on the whole of the sum now claimed from the Persian Government.

I HAVE just received your telegram of the 18th instant, informing me that you had seen the legation, which is awaiting further news from Tehran. The legation had asked for the papers relating to this affair, and the Foreign Office is to send these papers this week. I have sent a copy of my pamphlet, with a copy of the contract, to Messrs. Strick. I believe that the legation intends to submit the case to an expert in London. I hope that in case you have to appear you will mention the assurances which you have got from the British Government. For my own part, I reserve the right to do what is necessary on the subject as soon as it is confirmed that I am in the right, because it is certain that all I had to undergo came from the confidence which I had in these assertions and assurances. In case the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not yet sent the papers this week, I shall ask him to do it the next week without fail. Please send me a copy of your correspondence with the Minister for Foreign Affairs if there has been anything since the 31st March. I am just having printed the collection of all decisions of the Government given in my favour, and I shall send you a copy of it as soon as it is ready.

If we are invited to furnish explanations to the Persian Minister in London, you can rely upon our doing so, and we do not expect there will be any objection to our speaking of the assurances we have from time to time received as regards the oxide business from His Majesty’s Government. [2219 e —5] . COPY TO INDIA A..2li2....i9i./..

As commercial men, however, we have no hesitation m saying that, judging from the translation of the documents with which we have been furnished, the action of the Persian Government in confiscating your concession is an arbitrary and autocratic act, contrary to all law and justice, which, in our opinion, no constitutional Government should have committed.

At the same time, the negotiations need not have the effect of weakening the support given by His Majesty s Government to the claim, which has doubtless already been presented to the Persian Government, so that you would, so far as can be seen, lose nothing by acting as proposed.

Weir and Ellinger had been broken willingly by the former, whereas, so far as the Board are aware, there is no reason to suppose that, but for his forcible dispossession by the Persian Government, the relations between the Muin and the firms named would not have been maintained unimpaired. With regard to the final paragraph of the draft, the Board are inclined to think that the separate presentation of any portion of the claim is undesirable, as likely to give an impression that His Majesty’s Government regard that portion as less important, and so to facilitate its rejection.

The firman dated 1315 (1898), which confirms Nasr-ed-Din’s firman, that of 1312, and explicitly states that the latter was for the period of ten years. It annuls the concession wrongly given to Malcolms, and incidentally raises the taxes. (b.) No. 7. The firman dated 1322 (1904), confirming the Muin’s rights under the ten-year concession of 1312, which apparently had not 3 r et expired (the ten years, it would seem, dated from 1313), raising the rate of taxation, but mentioning no period of time. The interpretation of this firman,- translation of which is in your possession, was the real point of dispute between the Muin and the Persian Government. (c.) No. 8.

On p. 20 of Muin-ut-Tujjar’s pamphlet he writes that in the year 1307 (1889) a firman was issued (No. 1 on p. 1 of newspaper report) allotting the island to Hajji Nakhoda Ali for a term of five years, and that after the expiration of the five years O’.e., in 1312) Hajji Jafar (latterly called Malik-ut-Tujjar) obtained a firman for a term of ten years ''document No. 2), which was two years afterwards transferred to Muin-ut- Tujjar under the same conditions (document No. 3). Then followed the Malcolm incident, the upshot of which is known to you, and which ended in the confirmation of Muin’s rights under the firman of 1312. With reference to this incident, you state in your letter that you have heard that after judgment had been given in favour of the Muin the firman had been endorsed dated 1897, there is said to be a marginal note signed by the English Minister declaring that the concession belongs to the Muin-ut-Tuj jar.” The firman of 1314 (1897) was the firman (document No. 4 of the list) wrongly granted to Malcolm, and according to Muin’s account (p. 24 of the pamphlet) PERSIA.

The whole question then really turns on the interpretation of the firman of 1904, the terms of which are in your possession, and neither m the debates in the Medjhss nor in Mnin’s pamphlet are any convincing arguments brought forward that the phrase “ and onward,’’ as it appears in the translation furnished hy you, or henceforth, as appears in th^ legation translation, should in itself confer perpetuity and there is no other ground advanced by Muin or his supporters for his continued possession, save his moral rights to a priority from the Government m the future disposal of the mines. The speech, reported on p. 6 of the newspaper report, of Montassar-ul-Sultan seems to The matter ended, as stated in the letter from this Office of the 7th June last, in a compromise, which consisted in the payment to Muin of H. per ton on the oxide already mined at the time the Government took possession of the mines up to r 4,000f. Sir G. Barclay expresses the opinion that both the debate in thn Medjhss and Main’s own pamphlet fully confirm the account given by the Vekil-ul-Roaya to Mr. Marling, communicated to yon in the letter from this Office of the &lt;Mth -June, from which it appears that Muin’s original lease had expired in 1905, i.e., before the date on which he concluded his contract with Messrs. Weir. Whether the firman of 1904 entitled Muin to make contracts for a term of years beyond 1905 is the point at issue, and Muin’s agreement with Messrs. Weir that he should not he liable for damages in the event of the Persian Government dispossessing him point, in Sir G. Barclay s view, to Muin’s own doubt on the subject. . . Sir G. Barclay considers that insistence on the production of originals serves no useful object, as the firman of 1904: and no other is the subject of dispute. I am, &amp;c.

Weir to be diminished by the amount thus realised, and leave a balance representing mainly the loss of ordinary profit on handling the oxide, while Messrs. Ellinger’s claim in respect of commissions would remain substantially as at present. The aggregate balance of claims would thus amount to about 10,000b, and the value of the 5,218 tons of oxide, which it is proposed that the Persian Government should deliver free to Messrs. Weir and Ellinger, will apparently offset these aggregate claims apart from minor adjastments. , ’ I am further to suggest that it might be desirable to insert, in the paragraph preceding that to which reference is made above, a statement that against the claim of Messrs. Weir there is to be brought into account the price realised on sales of oxide from the stock held by them on the 1st October, 1910, while interest, storage charges, &amp;c., since that date will constitute an addition to the amount claimed.

The claims of the above firms, for whatever they are worth, can only be against the Muin-ut-Tujjar.

T ujjar only failed to carry out the Weir/Ellinger agreement because he was prevented from so doing by the Persian Government He has, therefore, merely to raise the defence of force majeure under the supplemental agreement, and the Weir/Ellinger claim on him must fail.

Section 1, [30947] No. 1. Foreign Office to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Company. Gentlemen, Foreign Office, August 12, 1911. WITH reference to previous correspondence relative to the shipment of red oxide from the Island of Hormuz, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that Messrs. Ellinger and Company have submitted to him proposals for the reconciliation of your interests with their own and those of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company in this matter. These proposals are that (1) no further shipments of oxide shall be made otherwise than by Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company until after the date of the termination of their contract with Muin-ut-Tujjar on the 31st March, 1912 ; (2) that they shall be allowed to take away the remainder of the oxide which they should have received under the contract if it were still in force ; and (3) that Messrs. Ellinger shall bring the value of the oxide thus received, as and when realised, into account against and in reduction of their and Messrs. Weir’s claims against the Persian Government. If these proposals are accepted Messrs. Elliuger are prepared to undertake to deliver to you at the exact cost laid down in store, the unsold balance of 4,095 tons of oxide warehoused at Avonmouth and 2,488 tons warehoused at Nordenham, and also to sell to you at the like cost the undelivered balance of 5,218 tons, which on the footing of these proposals, would be shipped by Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company. Messrs. Ellinger observe that for your protection you may desire to stipulate that the oxide which you would purchase under this arrangement shall be brought into account as if it were equivalent to shipments taken by you under your contract with the Persian Government. They do not overlook the fact that you would, under this arrangement, pay a slightly increased rate for the oxide as compared with what they understand to be your contract price with the Persian Government, but they state that this would be amply met by the fact that under the same contract, as they understand, you have had 1,000 tons of oxide allowed to you free cos t. • j -mv This scheme amounts to a proposal that the claims of Messrs. Weir and Ellinger should be satished by the Persian Government in kind instead of in money, and the assent of that Government would of course have to be obtained for the delivery to Messrs. Ellinger of the balance of 5,218 tons of oxide due under the contract between Messrs. Weir and Muin-ut-Tujjar, shipments by yourselves being held m abeyance until after the date of the termination of Messrs. Weirs contract on the 31st March, 1912. Messrs. Weir’s claim against the Persian Government amounts at present to 26,0531. 12 5 . I0d., and that of Messrs. Ellinger to 4,041Z. I 85 . These sums have been fixed after a careful scrutiny, conducted by the Board of Trade, of the manner 111 which the claims are made up and of the items of which they are compose , m re course of which scrutiny the claims have been somewhat reduced. Against the claim of Messrs. Weir there is to be brought into account the price realised on sales ot oxide from the stock held by them on the 1st October, 1910, while interest, storage charges, &amp;c., since that date will constitute an addition to the amount claimed. , The proposal to deliver the unsold stock of oxide to you at its cost price would if accepted, enable the present claim of Messrs. Weir to be diminished by the amount thus realised, and leave a balance representing mainly the loss ol or maiy pro on handling the oxide, while Messrs. Ellinger’s claim in respect of commissions would remain substantially as at present. The aggregate balance of claims wou us amoun to about 10 , 0001 ., and the value of the 5,218 tons of oxide which it is proposed that the [2141 m—1] COPY TO INDIA ^j »~.5^^.191..L SECRETARY’S NR.^f...mmm Persian Government should deliver free to Messrs. Weir and Ellinger will apparently offset these aggregate claims apart from minor adjustments. I am to state that the scheme now proposed has been attentively examined at the Board of Trade, and I am to express Sir E.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 31.) [f r °' 118 '' ) . I HAVE had the honour to receive your despatch No. 61 of the 7th June CL requesting my observations in regard to a letter from Messrs^ Ellinger, dated the 2nd June, and its enclosures on the subject of the Muin-ut-Tujjar concession for the Island of Hormuz. # . p , , , . Turnino- to the list of documents m the case to be found on p. 1 oi the newspaper reports (Enclosure 1 in Messrs. Ellinger’s letter), I would point out that document No. 2, the Royal firman dated 1312 (1894 or 1895), granting the mines to Malik-ut-Tujjar for ten years, is the main authority by which Muin in virtue of the transfer made to him m 1897 (document No. 3) came originally into possession of the mines. According to the newspaper reports, it would seem that the firman of 1312 was actually produced and read to the committee of the Medjliss, but as a matter of fact Abbas Kuh Khan has satisfied himself at an interview with Muin that the only firmans produced were those published in the pamphlet, and this statement is borne out m the pamphlet itself on p 48 in the passage quoted by Messrs. Ellinger, to the effect that ‘‘the originals of the firmans published in this brochure are temporarily lent to the Medjhss. The only firmans published in the pamphlet are (a.) No. 6. See list of documents on p. 1 of newspaper reports, the firman dated 1315 (1898) which confirms Nasr-ed-Dins firman, that of 1312 , and explicitly states that the latter was for the period of ten years. It annuls the concession wrongly mvpn to Malcolms and incidentally raises the taxes. . , . , , n g (b.) No. 7. The firman dated 1322 (1904) confirming the Mum s rights under the ten-vear concession of 1312, which was not yet expired apparently (the ten /ears apparently dated from 1313), raising the rate of taxation, hut mentioning no period o time Tim interpretation of this firman, translation of which was forwarded to you m my despatch Na 317 of the 19th December, 1908, was the real point o ispu e between the Muin and the Persian Government. _ _ _ TT P i r in His Maiestv’s (c.)

Ellinger, as there is no dispute that the verdict of the enquiry was to replace Muin in possession of his undoubted rights under the firman of 1312. On pp. 25 and 26 of his pamphlet Muiri describes the circumstances under which, before the expiry of his lease, efforts were made to increase the taxation payable by him, and the indefinite firman of 1322 (1904) was eventually granted to him confirming his rights in terms which the Muin interprets as “in perpetuity.” On p. 37 Muin again refers to this firman, and discusses the point that no limit of time was fixed in its terms, but nowhere does the Muin base his claim for the continued possession of the mines under any other firman than that of 1322 (1904), and nowhere does he dispute that the firman of 1312, of which the original is not forthcoming, was restricted to ten years. The whole question then really turns on the interpretation of the firman of 1904, the terms of which are in your possession, and neither in the debates in the Medjliss nor in Muin’s pamphlet are any convincing arguments brought forward that the phrase £&lt; and onward,” as it appears in the translation furnished by Messrs. Ellinger, or “ hence forth ” as it appears in the legation translation, should in itself confer the perpetuity, and there is no other ground advanced by the Muin or his supporters for his continued possession, save his moral rights to a priority from the Government in the future disposal of the mines. The speech reported on p. 6 of the newspaper report of Montassar-ul-Sultan, seems to give a just resume of the case. The matter ended, as stated, in your letter to Messrs. Ellinger of the 7th June last in a compromise. This compromise, as was reported in my telegram No. 23 of the 25th January, 1911. consisted in the payment to Muin of 11. per ton on the oxide already mined at the time the Government took possession of the mines, up to 24,000L Hitherto Messrs. Strick and Company, in accordance with the order of the Minister of Finance, have paid Muin this money in measure as the oxide was shipped, and about 600L has, I believe, been paid to him on this account. I hear confidentially, however, that Mr. Shuster, the new Treasurer-General, has ordered Messrs. Strick to desist from deducting L/. per ton in favour of Muin, but to make all payments for oxide in full to the Treasurer-General. The latter declares that he has no authority to pay the 1/. per ton to the Muin, and that when he applies for it, Mr. Shuster will ask him to produce all his documents in support of any or all of his claims on the Government, including those relating to the lease of the islands, and he will then submit the whole case to the decision of the Cabinet first and the Medjliss afterwards. I have the honour to return herewith the enclosures contained in your despatch under reply, and to express respectfully my opinion that both the debate in the Medjliss and the Muin s own pamphlet fully confirm the account given by the Vekil-ul-Roaya, as reported in Mr. Marling s despatch No. 72 of the 14th May, 1910, from which it appears that Muin s original lease had expired in 1905, i.e., before the date on which he con cluded his contract with Messrs. Weir. Whether the firman of 1904 entitled Muin to make contracts for a term of years beyond 1905 is the point at issue, and Muin’s agreement with Messrs. Weir that he should not be liable for damages in the event of the Persian Government dispossessing him points to Muin’s own doubt on the subject. In conclusion, I would submit that Messrs. Ellinger’s insistence on the production of originals serves no useful object, as the translation of the firman of 1904 is in their possession and yours, and no other is the subject of dispute.

In view of this fact, and of the further facts that the rate at winch the 1 ersian Government is now raising its new loan is 5 per cent, per annum, and that _ the interest on a commercial claim would naturally be reckoned at a rate substantially higher than that on a secured Government loan, the Board are disposed to vary the suggestion contained in their letter of the 4th April, and to lecommend that it would be reasonable to calculate the claim for interest due to delay m realisation of stocks (owing to the fact that Messrs. Strick have been able to supply the market) at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum. Should it prove possible to secure an agreement between the interested firms on e lines of the proposals referred to above, the Board would see no objection to the substitution of this plan for a money claim against the Persian Government, should it appear to the Foreign Office that advantage would arise by the substitution of the claim lor free oxide for a claim for money compensation.

WITH reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo and subsequent verbal communications on the subject of the shipment of red oxide from Hormuz island, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that this department has been in correspondence with the Board of Trade with regard to the proposals which you have made for the reconciliation of your interests and those of Messrs.

Strict recommending your scheme to their favourable consideration. Until the result of this step is known, it is clear that no further action need be taken at Tehran in connection with the presentation of your and Messrs. Weir’s claims under this head and, should Messrs. Strict accept your suggestions, the communication which will eventually have to be made to the Persian Government will have to be radically modified. In the meanwhile, Sir E. Grey takes note of the fact that the amount of the claims in question is reckoned only up to the 31st October last and not up to the end of last year. I am to add that, in accordance with your wish, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran will in no case mention to the Persian Government, at the present stage, the rate at which any claim put forward should bear interest till paid, and that Sir E.

WITH reference to pending questions regarding the Island of Hormuz, we have to-day received a letter from the Muin-ut-Tujjar, dated the 8th instant, enclosing copy of a telegram which he informs us was dispatched by the Persian Foreign Office to the Persian Minister in London, a copy of which we hand yon herein.

Let them know that, up to twenty days hence, if they do not fulfil their obligation they are responsible for all the losses. [2105 x —2] COPY TO INDIAUll lr i [ This ijocament is t/'o Proper ty oi His Brit&amp;ftniG Majesty s Government,! Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and ourselves, against the Persian Government, we enclose for your information a copy of a letter that we are writing to-day to’ His Majesty’s Foreign Office. While we are entitled on various grounds to claim the protection of His Majesty’s Government in priority to any other interest, we recognise that the Secretary of State may feel reluctant to do anything in our favour which can he regarded as injurious to the interests of Messrs. F. C. Strict and Co , we cannot for a moment admit that their interests ought to be allowed to come into conflict with our just rights as repeatedly urged, but at the same time we should be glad to render any assistance in our power to reconcile what may be thought to be the conflicting interests of two British subjects, and it is from that point of view that we threw out verbally the suggestion of which you have been informed and to which we will presently refer. As you will see from the enclosed copy letter, our proposal to the Foreign Office for settlement of the claims of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and ourselves, involves, (1) that no further shipments of oxide shall be made otherwise than by Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. ; (2) that Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. shall be allowed to take away the remainder of the oxide which they should have received under the contract if it were still in force ; and (3) that we shall bring the value of the oxide thus received, as and when realised, into account against and in reduction of the claims specified in the letter of which we enclose a copy. If our proposal is accepted, we are prepared, as we have verbally indicated, to undertake to deliver to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., at the exact cost laid down in store, the unsold balance of 4,095 tons of oxide warehoused at Avonmouth, and 2,488 tons warehoused at Nordenham, and also to sell to them at the like cost the undeliverd balance of 5,218 tons, which, on the footing of our proposal, would be shipped by Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. For the protection of Messrs. F. C. Strick and. Co. it may be desired by them to stipulate that the oxide which they would purchase under this arrangement shall be brought into account as if the same were equivalent to shipments taken by them under their contract with the Persian Government. We are not, of course, overlooking the fact that Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. would, under this arrangement, pay a slightly increased rate for the oxide as compared with what we understand to be their contract price with the Persian Government, but this would be amply met by the fact that under the same contract, as we understand, they have had 1,000 tons of oxide allowed to them free of cost for the express purpose of compensating them on their undertaking an obligation to protect the Persian Government from any claims consequent upon the contract with them being entered into. If you require any further information as to details, kindty let us know, and we will endeavour to furnish the same. We wish it to be distinctly understood that the suggestion thrown out by us is not made as an offer of compromise, but wholly and entirely from a desire to assist His Majesty’s Government in meeting a difficulty for which we are in no way responsible and which should not be allowed to stand in the way of our just and prior claims.

Messrs. Ellinger and Co. to Foreign Office.—(Received Jane 16.) Sir, / 28, Oxford Street, Manchester, June 15, 1911. WE confirm our letter of the 2nd instant, and now come back upon yours of the v 23rd ultimo, relative to the question of the concession for the shipment of red oxide from Hormuz. We note that Sir Edward Grey has addressed a telegram to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, instructing him to present to the Persian Government a claim on our behalf and on that of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. for losses suffered by both firms in this connection, and that Sir G. Barclay is to inform the Persian Government that at the end of last year Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co.’s claim amounted to 26,053L 12s. lOd. and our own to 4,041/. 18s., and that he is to point out, at the same time, that the contract between the two firms and the Muin-ut-Tujjar will not expire until the 31st March, 1912, so that, till that date is reached, the amount of both claims must increase with every shipment of red oxide made from Hormuz by the agency of any other person or firm, and, further, that the whole amount of the claim must bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum. We beg to draw your attention to the fact that the amount of the claims in question was fixed between the Board of Trade and ourselves as at the 1st October, 1910, and not as at the end of the year. We are also of the opinion that, although the contract between the Muin-ut-Tujjar, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and ourselves would, in the ordinary course, have expired on the 31st March, 1912, shipments subsequent to that date will increase the amount of our damages unless the stock of oxide which we hold has been previously realised, which, under existing circumstances, would seem improbable. We also take this opportunity of pointing out that it appears to us undesirable that Sir G. Barclay should notify the Persian Government at this stage of the rate at which any claim put forward is to bear interest. We, however, beg to remind His Majesty’s Government that the before-mentioned claims were put in on the footing of the very strong opinion expressed by Sir Edward Grey in the letter from your Office dated the 8th July, 1910, that the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession would be found to have been invalid at the time when the contract was made between him, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and ourselves, and that, as soon as we had reason to believe that this opinion as to the probable result of the investigation into the title of the Muin-ut-Tujjar to the concession might not prove to be well founded, Mr. M. Ellinger wrote to Mr. Maxwell on the 29th November, 1910, that we should expect not only indemnification for Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves for damages sustained, but also to be re-established in the position as it existed prior to the confiscation of the concession. . ^ Although the action of the Persian Government has rendered this impossible as between the Muin-ut-Tujjar, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and ourselves, we most humbly and respectfully beg to state that the mere presentation of these claims to the Persian Government cannot satisfy our claims on His Majesty s Government foi theii protection. . ... The promises of His Majesty’s Government’s support and protection, under wincn we and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. signed this contract, entitle us to claim at this stage that His Majesty’s Government should now notify the Persian Government that further shipments of oxide by others than Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. must not be permitted, and that they and we shall be indemnified by the Persian Government lor damages sustained by reason of their interference with our respective rights, and tliat Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. shall be allowed to take away the remainder of the oxide which thev would have received under the contract, and to bring the value of the same as and when realised into account against and in reduction of the claims of 26,053/. 12 s. 10c/. and 4,041/. 18s. and interest and any further damages as stated m this letter.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing translations of documents relating to the concession for the shipment of oxide from Hormuz, and to express to you his thanks for this communication. It appears from the translation of a newspaper report, which forms the first enclosure in your letter, that Muin-ut-Tujjar is correct in his assertion that he has communicated to the Medjliss the originals of the firmans and other documents connected with his concession which are in his possession. It would seem, however, that the committee appointed by that body to consider the question decided that the concession was not granted in perpetuity, and recom mended that the Persian Government should work the mines themselves. The Medjliss, before whom the report of the committee was laid, decided to refer the question back to the Cabinet for reconsideration, and the latter appear to have proposed a compromise with Muin. It was further stated in the Medjliss on the 24th December last that the Cabinet would lay their views on this point before the Assembly in writing; but there is nothing to show that this has been done, or that the question at issue has been settled. I am to state that a copy of your letter, with the documents enclosed in it, has been forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran for his observations, and that he has been instructed to defer making a communication to the Persian Government on the subject till the objections which, as it is understood, you wish to raise to the course proposed in the letter of the 23rd ultimo from this Office have been received and considered.

VVlL are m leceipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo relative to the question of the concession for shipment of red oxide from Hormuz. ^ We note that Sir Edward Grey has addressed a telegram to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, instructing him to present to the Persian Government a claim on our behalf and on that of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. for losses suffered by both firms in this connection. Mr. M. Ellinger has since had the pleasure of a conversation on this subject with Mr. Norman, and, as desired by the latter, we will shortly put our views before vou in writing. We understand that, in the meantime, Sir George Barclay will not actually present the claim. M ith reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter, in which you tell us that it appears from a telegram received from Sir George Barclay that the information which reached us to the effect that the Muin-ut-Tujjar had produced and circulated amongst the members of the Medjliss his original firman is incorrect, all the proofs produced by the Muin-ut-Tujjar being contained in a pamphlet, a copy of which, as Sir E. Grey understands, is already in our possession, we send you enclosed translation of a report in one of the Persian newspapers of the 5th November, 1910, of a debate in the Medjliss,-' from which it would appear that Muin-ut-Tujjar was directed to attend a sitting of the committee of the Medjliss and to bring with him all documents relating to his claim, and that at several sittings these documents were produced and read, and included the original firman in question. The report further states that the committee confirmed the original concession. In the pamphlet to which Sir George Barclay makes reference is a statement, on p. 48, signed by the Muin-ut-Tujjar, to the following effect:— “The originals of the firmans published in this brochure are temporarily lent to the Medjliss. Any deputy who desires to see them can do so.” You will notice that the report on the discussion in the Medjliss is dated November and that the pamphlet w'as published before your letter of the 7th March of this year, in which you write us as follows :— “ Sir Edward Grey concurred in this proposal, and Sir George Barclay made application, but was informed, in reply, that the Persian Government were not in possession of copies of the original lease and firmans, and we are doubtful whether the Muin-ut-Tujjar can produce them, as he has not hitherto done so. It was in the absence of these documents that the firman of 1904 was granted in confirmation of the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s lease. “ The present situation, therefore, is that, while the Persian Govermnent are not in a position to prove their contention, the Muin-ut-Tujjar is equally unable to offer evidence in support of his case. It cannot be supposed that he would neglect to take a step so beneficial to his interests if it were in his power to do so. “He has, however, it appears, published a pamphlet in support of his case, in which he states that the original lease given to Hajji Jafer Alawi (Malek-ut-Tujjar), and from whose heirs it was transferred to himself, was dated 1894, and was for ten years.” We have repeatedly pointed out to Mr. Norman that we had always heard that, after the dispute as to the ownership of the concession between the Muin-ut-Tujjar and Messrs. Malcolm, and after judgment had been given in favour of the Muin-ut-Tujjar, the firman had been endorsed by the British Legation at Tehran, and that for this reason we should expect a copy of the firman to be in the archives of the British Legation at Tehran, which we are given to understand is not the case.

If we must claim for the larger item, it must be on other grounds than those stated in the note, and I think that we must address a separate note in regard to it. In this case I presume I should use arguments set forth in paragraph 4, section 3, of Ellinger’s letter of 29th September last. They seem to me, however, very weak, for, so far as I can see, at any moment Muin might himself have changed his agent without any legal liability to Ellinger. With reference to supplementary claim mentioned in your telegram, I do not quite understand how every shipment of oxide can damage Messrs.

He is further to point out that the whole amount of the claim must, in justice, bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, which Sir E. Grey understands to be the rate agreed on between your firm and the Board of Trade. Sir G. Barclay is accordingly to warn the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government will be obliged subsequently to present supplementary claims on your and Messrs. Weir’s behalf. I am to add that it appears from a telegram received from Sir G. Barclay that the information which reached you to the effect that Muin had produced and circulated among the members of the Medjliss his original firman is incorrect, all the proofs adduced by Muin being contained in a pamphlet, copy of which, as Sir E.

Dear Sirs Tehran, April 29, 1911. ON the evening of the 27th instant I had an interview with the Muin-ut-Tujjai. In the course of conversation I asked him if he had notified W eir and Ellinger of his inability to ship at the time the Government took possession of the island of Hormuz from him last year, and he informed me that he had informed them by lettei and &gt;} wire in accordance with the terms of the supplemental contract. He also stated that for some months previous to the Government taking possession of the island he hot i wired and wrote to them that they must take steps to ship as much oxide as possible, or else give him permission to ship on his own account; that m the event o± t ie Government taking the island from him, he would lose all the oxide he had on it. The Muin-ut-Tujjar stated to me that Ellinger and Weir asked permission from him to take action against the Persian Government, but this he did not give. He added that Ellinger and Weir had protested through the British Foreign Ofhce and the British &amp; I asked the Muin when he was going to put his own men on the island of Hoi muz again : that I noticed the Customs officials were still in charge there. He replied t a he was unable to say ; that the present Cabinet had offered him a concession on the same terms as that offered by the late Cabinet, but he preferred to wait until the case was decided by the courts whether the previous firman still held good oi not. From the conversation I had with him I gathered that he had made no progress whatever with the present Cabinet. n ■ t ^ \ With regard to the bill for 24,0001. drawn by the late bani-ed-Dowleh, Minister of Finance, I told him I required a letter from the present Minister of Finance and one from the Minister of Mines and Public Works before I can act upon i ™ will probably have to give something to obtain these letters, and it is doubtful whethei he will succeed or not. i ht • i w • iriUnn-ov T In view of the supplemental contract between the Mum and \\ eu and Liimgei, J. do not think the Persian courts would allow the claim of tt eir and Ellmgoi agaii the Muin-ut-Tujjar.

As the Muin-ut-Tujjar has so far failed to obtain written authority to me from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Mines and Public Works with regard to dis- countino- the bill for 24,0007,, I yesterday instructed the Imperial Bank of Persia to refund you the 6,0007. which you had paid them to be held at my disposal on the 24th March. The situation is very obscure. It is difficult to understand why the late Sani-ed-Dowleh gave this bill of 24,0007. to the Muin-ut-Tujjar. _ There is still a possibility that the transaction may be repudiated by the present Cabinet.

T^ s y° u /^.. see fr om these letters and cablegrams, the position of matters between T mn ' Ut ~ i tJie . 1&gt;ers ^ an Government is continually changing. On the 15th January the Finance Minister authorised the payment of 24,000L to the Muin-ut- lujjar and the latter, as mentioned in Mr. Brown’s letter of the 28th January had a § P - j ^ h T f ° r an advance of 6,0001- on account, but as Sir George Barclay having advised Mr. Brown on no account to part with any money without reference to him no advance was made. Later on, as^ you will see from the cablegrams, the position of affairs had changed, and Mr. Brown informed us that he proposed advancing the 6,0001. to the Muin-ut- lujjar unless he heard to the contrary. We thereupon remitted the 6,0001. to r. ^ roYvn by cablegram, and authorised him to make the payment on the terms mentioned m our cablegram of the 18th February. This was on the 23rd March, since w en^ we have heard nothing on the subject until to-day, when we were somewhat surprised to learn that the position had again changed, and that consequently he had not advanced the 6 ,0001. to the Muin-ut-Tujjar; in fact, he has cabled this sum back to us. As mentioned by Mr. Strick at the interview he had with Mr. Norman last week, we wrote fully to Mr. Brown at the end of March on the subject of Ormuz, and even d he does not reply by cable, we shall doubtless receive an answer by letter in the course of a few days. Should his reply contain any information of interest, we will pass same on to you immediately. We have, &amp;c. FBANK C. STRICK and Co. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Mr. Brown to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. Dear Sirs, _ Tehran, January 28, 1911. EOF some time past there has been some talk about the Mum-ut-Tujjar obtaining a concession for all the islands in the Persian Gulf as well as for several mines on the littoral. The British Minister has been keeping a close watch on any movement in this direction, and I have had several interviews with him on the subject. On the 19th instant mention was made of it in the Medjliss. On hearing of this on the 21st instant Sir George Barclay sent for me, and he thought it advisable that I should see the Sani-ed-Dowleh, Minister of Finance, which I did that evening. From my conversation with the Sani-ed-Dowleh, I learned that the Government had decided to pay the Muin-ut Tujjar 24,000L, the price of the oxide which was mined on the island of Hormuz at the date when the Government took it over from the Muin. This 24,000L was payable at the rate of ll. per ton on each ton as shipped by you to date [1975 n—7] COPY TQ INDIA ttinuIiliuiljtinuiJinA 9 1./..from the 1st January last. The Sani-ed-Dowleh also informed me that the Main had asked him to approach me with a view to your paying this money to the Muin-ut- Tuiiar under discount. I replied that you had already paid the Government 10s. per ton in advance, and that if you were to pay a further ll now, it would leave only 10s. per ton margin, which was too small; and that I did not think you would be prepared to advancr^ any more money unless you were given something else in hand. I suggested that yon mio-ht possibly see your way to making the proposed advance if the Persian Government were to grant you a concession for the working and development of the Persian Gulf Littoral and the Gulf islands. I asked him about the concession of these islands, &amp;c., to the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and he said it had been ascertained by the Government that the cost of delivering oxide on board steamer at Hormuz was about 12^- per cent., and they proposed to entrust this to the Muin-ut-Jujjar m future instead of the customs officials doing it, and that in addition to the 12^ per cent they would allow the Muin a further 1 per cent, for his trouble, making ISj per cent, in all. That the Cabinet had decided to give the Muin the concession for Hormuz on condition that he paid the Government 75 per cent, of the net profits and retained 25 per cent, himself. I pointed out that all the mines had been in the hands of the Muin for fifteen years, and he had done nothing to develop them. He said the Muin had given as his excuse that he had no confidence in the Government. I said that you were in a much better position to develop this business than the Muin-ut-Tujjar; that you had your own steamers to convey the products in, and that you were in touch with markets for selling them in. The Sani-ed-Dowleh asked me on what terms you would undertake the business, and, as I thought it advisable to make the best offer possible, I said you would be prepared to give half the net profits to the Government. He asked me to put the offer in writing, which I did, as per press copy of my letter of the 25th January enclosed. I subsequently discovered that the actual terms on which they had offered the concession to the Muin were as follows : — 75 per cent, of the net profits of Hormuz to go to the Government. 10 per cent, of the net profits of the other islands and other mines, &amp;c., on the littoral to go to the Government. The term of the concession to be ninety-nine years. On the 23rd January the Muin-ut-Tujjar presented the order of the Ministry of Finance drawn on you for the payment of 24,000L, as per copy enclosed (translation). I should like your instructions with regard to this. He also handed me a letter from the Minister of Finance (copy enclosed) with regard to the claim of Weir. On the 24th January I had a long interview with Muin-ut-Tujjar. I enclose copies of the claims of Weir and Ellinger, w T hich I got from him. The Muin states that the supplemental contract with Weir annuls any such claim. I talked with him about the proposed concession which the Persian Government were prepared to give him, and he said he was not anxious to accept it, as he preferred to have the concession on the terms of the old lease and firman. He was anxious to do all his work through you, as he had always been satisfied with the treatment he had received in the past at your hands, while he complained about Ellinger. He wished to know if you would let him have 6,000/.—against the 24,000/.—under discount, and asked me to telegraph to you in this connection. He apparently wishes the money to strengthen his position with the Government. He said your action with regard to this would show to what extent you would be prepared to work with him on friendly terms in the future. He offered to pay the cost of getting a reply from you by wire, but I told him I could not explain the matter fully by wire, but that I would write to you and ask you to wire your decision. Sir George Barclay has told me on no account to part with any of this money without reference to him. This 24,000/. represents part of the compensation allowed by the Persian Govern ment to the Muin-ut-Tujjar for the oxide which he had mined ready on the Island of Hormuz when the Government took it from him. The arrangement is that the Persian Government should pay him 42s. 6d. per ton for every ton so mined and ready on the island at the time. The Muin estimates that the quantity will be about 16,000 tons. It seems strange that the Persian Government should sell to you at 40s. and buy from the Muin at 42s. 6c/., but such appears to be the case. I am, &amp;c. D. BLOWN. fEnclosure 2 in No. 1.

ACCORDING to the conditions of the agreement concluded between the Persian Government and your firm, Messrs. Frank C.

This, we understand, has not yet been done, as the Muin has approached the Government on the subject.

Mr. Brown to Persian Minister of Finance. Your Excellency, Tehran, January 25, 1911. WITH reference to our conversation of the 21st instant, I now beg to submit to you the following proposal, viz. :— That a concession be granted to Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Co. (Limited) for the mining, working, and development of all mines, minerals, and natural products, other than those contained in the concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), on the Persian Gulf Littoral to a distance of 40 miles (about 10 farsakhs) inland and on all the Persian islands in the Gulf for a period of sixty years. In consideration of such concession Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Co. (Limited) agree to pay the Persian Govern ment 50 per cent, of the net profits obtained. I am, &amp;c. For Frank C. Strick and Co.

I duly received your telegram of the 18 th instant as follows : • “If vou consider policy and Sir George Barclay approves will agree to ad\ance 6,000Z. under usual discount 10 per cent.

And, in reply, I wired you to-day :—- “ After consulting British Minister do not think it advisable advance money ^ Muin-ut-Tujjar. My letter 28th January Ellinger and Co. Manchester claim eompensa-F tion from Muin-ut-Tujjar.” The assassination of the Sani-ed-Dowleh has changed the situation to a considerable extent. He favoured the Muin-ut-Tujjar. TheVekil-ul-Roya says he does not think there is any chance of the Mums concession ever being brought before the Medjliss, and that if it is brought before the Medjiiss it will be howled out. Sir George Barclay is against making any advance to the Muin-ut-Tujjar, as he can foresee the remote possibility of the legation haying to sequestrate this money. He agrees with me also that every penny of money paid to the Muin-ut-Tujjar enables him to strengthen his position, and that is not what we want. There is also the possibility that the°Persian Government may wish to cancel the arrangement come to between the Minister of Finance (the late Sani-ed-Dowleh) and the Muin-ut-Tujjar, and, in that case, the 24,000/. would not have to be paid to the Muin. It is quite clear that the Muin is not entitled to any compensation of this nature whatever. The whole thing is a sop to keep him quiet. I have informed the Muin-ut-Tujjar that you were quite prepared^ to advance him the 6,000/., at the usual 10 per cent, discount, but that there were difficulties in the way, which prevented you from doing so for the present. I will probably hear further from him to to-morrow. It will be necessary to play him a little. The latter part of your telegram was not quite clear to me. I have no reason to think that the Muin-ut-Tujjar was not paid in full for the oxide which was shipped by Weir, though it is possible that ELlinger may have put a stop on part of his balance with them, pending settlement of their claim for compensation. Of this, however, I have no news. It may have been on a score of this kind that the Muin-ut-Tujjar last summer requested that you should assist him in settling his accounts with Ellinger. The accounts which I enclosed in my letter of the 28th January were the claims of Weir and Ellinger on the Muin for compensation under their contract for oxide with the Muin. These were copies of the statements of their claims submitted by them to the Foreign Office. Is there no possible way of coming to a settlement with Weir and Ellinger with regard to these claims. The legation would be glad to see an amicable settlement come to between you and them in England. What are your views on the subject? The Vekil-ul-Roya informs me that as soon as a Cabinet is formed he will be able to go ahead with your concession for the Persian islands in the Gulf and the Gulf Littoral. Mr. C. Alban Young, Councillor of the British Legation, informed me of a despatch they had had from Colonel Cox from Bushire with regard to the sulphur mines at Bostana, near Lingah. Colonel Cox says these mines should be secured by some British firm. Some time ago he had samples of the sulphur sent home and analysed, and they gave 99 per cent, pure sulphur. I am, &amp;c.

Your telegram No. Proofs circulated by Muin-ut-Tujjar in Medjliss were all contained in pamphlet f ya &amp;/ referred to in my telegram No. 29 [of 31st January]. Original firman is not produced, but it is stated by Muin-ut-Tujjar to have been dated 1894 (not 1874, as stated in your letter of 7th'’'March to Ellinger), and to have been for duration of ten years, i.e., from 1895. I am not aware that this fact is disputed by any of parties. Muin-ut-Tujjar seems to rest his case mainly on firman of 1894, translation of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 317 of 19th December, 1908, and which he interprets as giving perpetuity to above-mentioned concession. I see no objection, except that expressed in my telegram No. 23 [of 25th January], paragraph No. 4, to making proposed communication as regards losses at Hormuz. As regards Ellinger’s losses as Muin-ut-Tujjar’s agent for rest of his concessions, I have never raised this point in my warnings to the Persian Government, and I have nothing to go by in support of any contention that Ellinger had a permanent contract with Muin-ut-Tujjar to act as his agent. Such a claim would be, I think, regarded as hardly fair by Persian Government, and to press it would, while tending to excite distrust towards British enterprise, strengthen position of Muin-ut-Tujjar, whose mischievous influence in Gulf we should do our best to curtail. On the other hand, if we only threaten Persian Government with claiming compensation for losses arising out of the non-fulfilment of Weir’s contract, we shall probably elicit nothing more than on previous occasions. I assume that, as you make no mention of my objection in my telegram No. 23, paragraph No. 4, you do not attach much importance to it, and assuming also that it is impossible to induce Strick to satisfy Weir and Ellinger, I would suggest I shoidd present claim to Persian Government on following lines :— (R.) “His Majesty’s Government understand Muin held a concession for ten years granted by a firman dated 1894. In 1904 this concession appears to have been confirmed by a further firman for an indefinite period. “ Without prejudice to question as to whether or no Persian Government had right at all to dispossess Muin of his concession, His Majesty’s Government consider terms of second firman, together with fact that Muin was in undisputed possession in 1908, justified British firms in entering into a contract with Muin for purchase of oxide for a reasonable period ahead and in expecting that contract should be respected. “ In August 1909, when Persian Government thought of dispossessing Main, I warned your Excellency’s predecessor, and on 11th April, 1910, I informed him His Majesty’s Government insisted on its being maintained.

I AM directed by the Board of Trade to advert to your letter of the 29th December last, and to state that the Board have received from Messrs. Ellinger and Co. copies of all invoices relating to their deliveries of oxide during the twelve months the 1st April, 1909. to the 31st March, 1910, from which it appears that the average prices realised were 686*. 2d. per ton on 4,562 tons delivered from Avonmouth stocks in that period and 756. lid. per ton on 1,808 tons delivered from Nordenham stocks. In an interview between Mr. Martin Ellinger and the Assistant Secretary of the Commercial Department of the Board of Trade on the 15th February last, Mr. Ellinger stated that the costs of laying down the oxide at Avonmouth and at Nordenham were substantially identical, the charges at the latter port being slightly below those at Avonmouth. It would appear, therefore, that, had sales of the stocks referred to in print No. 22,779/LO been made at the average prices shown by Messrs. Ellinger s invoices for 1909-10, the profit realised would have been 105. 2d. per ton (see Statement (A) enclosed). The Board understand from Mr. Ellinger that, so far as relates to the claim for damages submitted on behalf of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., they desire to adhere to the form previously submitted, and a statement of the sum claimed, amended in accordance with the complete data referred to above in reference to the average prices and profit realised in 1909-10 and anticipated in respect of the stock held on the termination of the contract formerly held by them, is attached (see Statement (B) ). With reference to Messrs. Ellinger’s claim, the Board are informed that the specification of the amount of 31,000 tons in the second item represents a claim for the loss of commissions, in anticipation of which the firm had incurred outlay and entered into commercial arrangements, and for the damage suffered by them in their business through the breach ol contract. The figures put forward as a measure of this damage and loss are found to represent less than five years’ losses of commission on the basis of the average sales of oxide in Europe during the period March 1907-February 1911. Messrs. Ellinger s claim is shown on the attached Statement (B), but the question of the period upon which compensation for estimated losses should be based, if the period of five years be not accepted by the Foreign Office, is one which should be determined by an arbitrator. While the Board of Trade note from the correspondence that encouragement appears to have been given officially to Messrs. Ellinger to establish business relations having in view a more or less extended period of supply of red oxide, they are unable, without an inspection of the original grant by the Persian Government to the Muin-ut- Tujjar, to offer any observations on the subject of the legal validity of the claim made by Messrs. Whir and Elhnger. They have some doubt whether the Firman of 1904, as given in translation on Print No. 2162/09, can be held to afford a definite assurance that the grant was a perpetual one, but they note from Print No. 5181/11, enclosed in your letter of the 1st March, that Messrs. Strick have definitely undertaken full responsibility for any lawful claim by Messrs. Weir and Ellinger against either the Persian Government or the Muin-ut-Tujjar. I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY.

WE beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the rth^arch, relative to the question of the deposits of red oxide on the Island of Hormuz. W e must frankly express our extreme surprise at the entirely new and utterly unexpected attitude which is taken up towards us in your letter, and which we must respectfully describe as being a complete reversal of everything that has been promised and said to us in previous communications. The one thing which has been impressed upon us by His Majesty’s Government above aL others as compelling temporary inaction on their part, and preventing any steps being taken to redress the injury which has been inflicted upon us as British subjects by the forcible dispossession of the Muin s concession and the tearing up of our contract with him by the Persian Government, has been this—that His Majesty’s Government felt it necessary, in the first instance, to afford the Persian Government the opportunity of showing by conclusive evidence that they were justified in their declaration of the lapse in 1906 of the concession on the faith of which our contract was made. This evidence His Majesty’s Government have, through their Minister, been pressing the Persian Government to produce for many months past, while leaving us in the meantime to suffer all the consequences of the violation of our contract rights, and now at last it is apparent on the face of your letter that the Persian Government are utterly unable to produce any evidence whatever, and have completely abandoned any attempt to substantiate the story told to Mr. Marling by Vekil-ul-Roaya, or the charges made by that gentleman of the production by the Muin of documents bearing forged signatures. We are surprised to see that Sir George Barclay speaks of the Persian Govern ment producing proof of their contention that the lease was revocable at will, as this is the first intimation we have had that the Persian Government had given any reason for their action other than that the concession lapsed m 1906, and had not been renewed, the firman of 1904 doing no more than alter some and confirm others of the provisions of the original firman, but without extending it. Sir George Barclay also seems to go so far as to suggest that the Persian Govern ment might prove their case by an assertion that their action was taken in virtue of their sovereign rights and in conformity with religious law and with custom. It is impossible to reconcile any such suggestion with the fulfilment of the assurances of protection and security that have been given throughout to us and our friends, and we respectfully point out that it was for the express purpose of being protected against any such act of arbitrary confiscation that we sought and obtained , these assurances of protection from His Majesty’s Government on which we have implicitly relied. Matters having reached this point we should have confidently expected, and as we venture to say, have been thoroughly justified from your previous communications to us in believing that upon the failure of the Persian Government to prove their case His Majesty’s Government would have immediately insisted upon the cessation of further shipments of oxide from Hormuz to others than Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and have come to our assistance in every possible way and seen that justice was done to us. But your letter while admitting that the Persian Government have failed to prove their contention that the concession lapsed in 1906 (upon which ground, and upon which ground only His Majesty’s Government have based their repeated refusals to prevent the violation of our rights and those of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., by the shipment of oxide by any other than the Muin or Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co.) now seeks to put upon the Muin and inferentially upon us the task of proving a negative to His Majesty’s Government, who have themselves assured us of the perpetuity of the concession, by suggesting that the Muin is unable to offer evidence in support of his contention, and this suggestion is set up appm ^iitly-a^--^r-reason for [1975 a—2] | COPY TO INDIA i / .../ 101 .'... 1 SECRETAI’.Y’S N° £..]allowing matters to be brought once more to a deadlock and depriving us of the support of His Majesty’s Government, on which we have been relying for years. We entirely refuse to believe that His Majesty’s Government can regard this seriously as an answer to our just grievance as British subjects, who have throughout been actively encouraged to obtain a footing m the Island of Hormuz, and as a ground^*^ for still doing nothing on our behalf, while at the same time apparently contemplating with equanimity the spectacle of the Persian Government compensating their own subject for the forcible disturbance of the Mu in’s concession and our contract. It is unnecessary to recapitulate facts which have been repeatedly submitted by us as bearing on the question of the validity of the Muin’s concession, and we limit ourselves to drawing vour attention again to the Secietaiy of fetate s letter of the 18th January, 1908, which distinctly establishes the fact that m the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the Muin held a concession in perpetuity, and that the firman and rescript confirming it had actually been seen at the British Legation. Not only was this assurance given to us for our own satisfaction, but it was also given for the express purpose of our encouraging other Rntish subjects to take a commercial interest in the concession, and we were to be at liberty to show it to approved third persons. We also specially invite your re-perusal of paragraph (17) and (18) of the memorandum of our solicitors, dated the 5th January last, in which are carefully recapitulated the other facts and views submitted by us upon the subject of the vitality of the concession, against which there appears to be nothing to set except a verbal statement by Vekil- ul-Roaya, which cannot be substantiated, and of which as far a§ we can gather Mr. Marling never seems to have been able to obtain any official confirmation. We venture to say that for amply sufficient reasons which have hitherto, as we have been led to suppose, been fully regarded as such by His Majesty’s Government, it has rested all this time with the Persian Government alone to show by reasonable evidence that they were justified in treating the Muin’s concession to our very great injury as having lapsed by effluxion of time before the contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves was entered into, and that they have not only conspicuously failed after great delay to adduce any evidence at all, but have openly admitted by their action that they had unjustly violated the Muin’s rights, and we confidently ask you to accept that view of the whole matter in common justice to us and our friends, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. With the active encouragement of His Majesty’s Government, who admittedly had good reasons for wishing the commercial control of the Island of Hormuz to remain in British hands, we have been working for years in this business. We have had every reason to believe, and still believe, the Muin’s concession to be good and valid, and our contract rights are founded upon it. The concession has been forcibly cancelled and our contract violated by the Persian Government, who have been called upon to show that they had ground for such high-handed action at the expense of British subjects, and after a whole year’s delay have utterly failed to do so. We most humbly and respectfully beg that His Majesty’s Government will now see to it that shipment by others than the Muin and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. are forthwith discontinued, and that all the parties to the contract are reinstated in their rights and adequately compensated for the wrongs done to them and the losses they have incurred. We are, &amp;c. ELLINGER and Co.'This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] I AM directed b}' Secretarj^ Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24tlrultimo relative to the question of the deposits of red oxide on the Island of Hormuz. I am to inform you, in reply, that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in accordance with Sir E. Grey’s instructions, addressed to the Persian Government a note informing to hold them responsible for any injury to British interests through their action in violation of that contract. The Persian Government, in reply, merely stated that, when concluding a contract Sir E. Grey accordingly enquired by telegraph whether Sir G. Barclay expected the Persian Government to make any further explanation, and what kind of proof of their contention he considered that they could produce. Sir G. Barclay replied that he could obtain no further information officially, but that the Persian Government had informed him privately that, in their opinion, Muin’s rights under the firmans of 1895 and 1904 legally expired in 1905, but that as he had been suffered to continue to work the mines, and his rent had been accepted up till March 1910, they felt it right to pay him the value of the oxide which had been mined by him before that date, and of which they had taken possession. Sir G. Barclay could not say what proof the Persian Government could produce of their contention that the lease was revocable at will, except that afforded by an assertion that their action was taken in virtue of their sovereign rights and in conformity^ with religious law and with custom. He accordingly proposed to ask for an opportunity to inspect the different firmans bearing on the case, though he did not feel sanguine of any useful result from this request. Sir E. Grey concurred in this proposal, and Sir G. Barclay made the application, but was informed in reply that the Persian Government were not in possession of copies of the original lease and firman, and were doubtful whether Muin could produce them, as he had not hitherto done so. It was in the absence of these documents that the firman of 1904 was granted in confirmation of Muin’s lease. The present situation therefore is that, while the Persians are not in a position to prove their contention, Muin is equally unable to offer evidence in support of his, since it cannot be supposed that he would neglect to take a step so clearly beneficial to his interests if it were in his power to do so. He has, however, it appears, published a pamphlet in support of his case, in which he states that the original lease given to ,4 OO&amp;fiftDlQII [March 7.J PERSIA. CONEIHENTIAL. [7081] No. 1.

We regret now to have to inform you that we have news that the steamer “ Tabaristan ” left Ormuz on the 19th instant with a cargo of oxide, and we have every reason to suppose that this shipment will be followed by others in the immediate future unless prompt action is taken by His Majesty’s Government. We should be glad to hear as soon as possible the result of the pressure which His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has been desired to bring to bear upon the Persian Government in the strongest manner to produce the desired proofs, and that effect has been given to our suggestion that a reasonably short time-limit should be given.

I now learn that the Persian Government have cancelled Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession for mining in Hormuz, thus Tendering it impossible for Muin-ut-Tujjar to fulfil bis contract with the British firm.

Andrew Weir and Co. by the cancellation of Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession, and I must insist on the maintenance of Messrs.

I^reply to your Excellency’s note of the 16th December last respecting the Persian Government’s agreement with Strick and Co. for the sale of red onde, it is necessary that I should draw your Excellency s attention to the following point . When concluding the contract with Strick and Co. the Persian Government considered the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s lease to have expired; furthermore in article 12 of the contract with Strick and Co. it is stipulated that the purchaser undertakes full responsibility to settle any legal claim which Andrew Weir and Co. or Ellmger and Co. might have against the seller or against Muin-ut-Tujjar, in virtue of the existing agreemen regarding oxide concluded between Mum-ut-Tujjar and Andrew Weir and Co. o that no kind of loss should be sustained on this account by the Government or by Muin-ut- UJJa in these circumstances, you admit that if Andrew Weir and Co. have anvthnig to say, Strick and Co. must, in accordance with the above-mentioned article, responsible. I avail, &amp;c. _ t MOHTASHEM-ES-SULTANEH.i [This Document is the Property of Els Britannic Majesty's Government,] red oxide on the Island of Ormuz, and regret exceedingly that, pending the result of the pressure which His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran will very shortly bring to bear upon the Persian Government in the strongest manner -to produce proofs of their assertion that the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession expired previous to the date of his agreement with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, Sir Edward Grey is unable to modify the view expressed in the letter from your Office of the 15th ultimo. We beg to point out to you that, on the 29th November last, Mr. Martin Ellinger was informed by Mr. Maxwell that steps had been recently taken which should result in the production of the expected note by the Persian Government in proof of their statement regarding the Muin-ut-Tuj jar’s concession. Mr. Mallet wrote to us on the 15th December last :— “ As the Persian Government have hitherto failed to reply to Sir George Barclay’s communication by furnishing the proof demanded by Sir E. Grey, who fully recognises the urgency of the matter and the reasonable nature of your request, has instructed him by telegraph to make a further serious representation to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject,” Mr. Norman also told Mr. Ellinger on the 18th instant that the matter had been delayed by the Mohurran, and that this having now terminated a reply was daily expected. It is, therefore, quite evident that the Persian Government are doing all they can to delay furnishing the promised evidence, and have disregarded very considerable pressure already applied by His Majesty’s Government. If it be ultimately found that the Persian Government cannot produce proof justifying their action the shipments which Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Co. have for the last ten years been in the habit of making in the months of February and March will, if continued this year, further seriously prejudice Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, and we should therefore like to be assured that in this event His Majesty’s Government will insist upon payment of the damages which we shall have sustained, and that the Persian Government are in a position to pay such damages. We venture otherwise to suggest that, in view of the urgency of the matter, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran should be desired to indicate a reasonably short time limit within which the required proof should be forthcoming.

Sir, 28, Oxford Street, Manchester, January 5, 1011. ^ WE beg to acknowledge receipt of your letier of the 15th December, 1910, ( relative to the question of the mines of red oxide on the Island of Ormuz. We thank you for your telegraphic instructions to Sir George Barclay to make a further serious representation to the Persian Minister for foreign Affairs on the subject, and point out to his Excellency the heavy pecuniary liability to which his Government is exposing if self, through their omission to bring forward conclusive evidence of their contention, but regret that up tv&gt; this date we are without any information that these representations have had any result. We note with great regret that His Majesty’s Government have not so far seen their way to complv with our second request by calling upon the Persian Government to suspend all further shipments of oxide from Ormuz, and the reasons which Sir Edward Grey has so courteously advanced have had our most careful consideration. Whilst freely and frankly admitting that we ourselves are not in the best position to judge this matter impartially, we desire with all due respect to submit that the reasons advanced by Sir Edward Grey are inconclusive, and that the result of a continuance of the present position must be antagonistic to our interests and those of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and in a corresponding degree favourab e to the interests of others who have no claim in this matter to the support of His Majesty’s Government. We have therefore asked our solicitors, Messrs. E. F. Turner and Sons, to prepare a memorandum, which we now enclose, setting forth the grounds upon which we base our request that the suspension of shipmems should be effected, and we most earnestly and humbly beg His Majesty’s Government to give their serious consideration to our representations, with a view of finding means to give effect to what we ask, which will we feel sure materially relieve the situation for t ie time being, as far as Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourse lves are concerned, while the cessation of the flow of money into the coffers of the Persian Government as payment for o\ide will, we venture to think, materially conduce to bring about a more speedy and satisfactory solution of this matter than has hitherto appeared practicable. We are answering in a separate letter the last paragraph of your letter, as it refers to a subject that is not relevant to the purpose of this letter and its enclosure. We are, &amp;c. ELLIN GEB and Co. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum showing Reasons in support of the view that Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. are justified in asking His Majesty's Government to call upon the Persian Government to stop further Shipments of Oxide from the Island of Hormuz until the Rights of the Parties interested have been ascertained to the satisfaction of His Majesty's Government. IN order to present this matter adequately, it is necessary to recapitulate the events leading up to the present situation. 2. For many years past, and until the spring of last year, the Muin-ut-Tujjar claimed and exercised without question the exclusive right of shipment of red oxide from the Island of Ormuz under a concession from the Persian Government granted in 1896, and transferred to him in 1897. 3. In the exercise of this right he from time to time, prior to the period next referred to, made contracts for the shipment of red oxide to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co , under contracts negotiated through Messrs Ellinger and Co., as his accredited represen tatives in this country, and in all these contracts stipulations w r ere made confining to the particular quantity purchased the importation of red oxide from Ormuz into this country. [1845/—5] B4. In the year 1907 the Mum became desirous of making more extended arrangements in the form of a lengthened contract, and after negotiations with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., which proved abortive, Messrs Ellinger and Co., with the active encourage ment of His Majesty’s Foreign Office and India Office, made efforts to carry out tb Muin’s wishes by creating an English company, to be formed for the purpose of taking a long contract from him and securing a monopoly for the mining of Ormuz oxide. '). It was a vital condition of the success of any scheme that Messrs. Ellinger and Co. should be able to give assurances that the Muin’s concession was held by him in perpetuity, and they had correspondence and interviews on that subject at the time with His Majesty’s Government, and a letter dated the 18th January, 1908, was received by them from the Foreign Office, which was to be regarded as strictly private and confidential, and to be shown only to persons whom the Government might approve. Various assurances were given in this letter upon the condition that they were to hold good only so long as the enterprise remained British, and among these assurances was the following :— “ That so far as His Majesty’s Government are aware the concession to the Muin is in perpetuity. The firman and rescript confirming it have been seen at the British Legation at Tehran.” 6. The company scheme was found to be impracticable in consequence of the difficulties placed in the way by Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., and m the spring of 1908 Messrs. Ellinger and Co. entered into preliminary negotiations with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. for the latter to take a contract from the Muin, and on the 9th April Messrs. Ellinger and Co. wrote to the Secretary of State, asking for permission to give inspection of the above-mentioned letter of the 18th January, 1908, to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., which permission was granted by a letter dated the 4th May, 1908, and was acted on. 7. For several months following this communications took place on the part of Messrs. Ellin^er and Co. with the Foreign Office, with the late Mr. Wilson Fox of the Board of Trade, and with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., the effect of which may shortly be stated to be that owing to the desire of the Secretary of State to maintain the continued association of Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. with the importation of red oxide from Hormuz into this country, in consequence of the friendly relations that had existed between His Majesty’s Government and that firm, Messrs. Ellinger and Co. endeavoured in every possible way to come to terms with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., but found it quite impossible to do so. 8. On the 18th ^November, 1908, a letter was written by a member of Messrs. Ellinger and Co.’s firm to the Secretary of State, reporting information received from the Muin to the effect that the Persian Legation in London were negotiating with a British firm for the purchase of the concession, and enquiring whether the Muin might be informed “ that so long as the sale of the oxide is in the hands of my firm no application to the Persian Government by any other British subject lor the grant of the concession of the Island of Hormuz and consequent confiscation of the concession now held in perpetuity by the Muin-ut-Tujjar will receive the support of His Majesty’s Government here or the British Legation in Tehran.” This question was answered in the affirmative in a letter from the Secretary of State dated the 25th November, 1908. 9. It results from the foregoing paragraphs that down to the time of the contract next referred to being made a continuous chain of communications between Messrs. Ellinger and Co. and His Majesty’s Government, extending back for years, affirmed— (1.) The existence of a perpetual concession as having been granted to the Muin ; (2.) 1 he anxious desire of His Majesty’s Government that the trading interest ol the Island of Hormuz should be in the hands of British subjects ; and (3.) ihe recognition of Messrs. Ellinger and Co. as having thoroughly earned and acquired an acknowledged prior claim to the protection of His Majesty’s 'Government, whether as against a British subject or anyone else. 10. Upon the faith of this situation and only after all efforts to make terms with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. had failed, Messrs. Ellinger and Co. negotiated a contract between the Muin and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., 'which was entered into on the 4th December, 1908, together with a supplemental agreement of the same date, Messrs. Ellinger and Co. themselves being also parties to both contracts in the capacityof agents for the Mum Under the first-mentioned contract the Muin agreed to sell about 18,000 tons of oxide, to be mined at Hormuz, upon various conditions as to time and payment, and an undertaking was given by the Muin to confine all shipments of oxide to Messrs Andrew Weu- and Co. until the 1st April, 1912, other than oxide *%r consumption in India. The fact that this contract was about to be entered into was f. M J 1 yS »i G0 Ifu men , t “ of a promise previously.obtained from Mr. M. Ellinger by Mr. Mallet that such an intimation would be given before any contract was made, and His Majesty’s Government were also informed of the actual signing of the contract in a letter from Messrs. Ellinger and Co., also dated the 4th December, 1908. 11. The contract thus entered into was carried out on both sides until further performance ot it became impossible for tbe reasons next referred to. • uJ 2 ' ^ s P rin g of [909 ^e Muin was threatened with disturbance of his nghts owing to the action of the nationalists, and the assistance of His Maiesty s Government, on behalf of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., was invoked by Messrs. Ellinger and Co., the result of whose application for support may best be illustrated by the following extract from a letter dated the 5th May, 1909, received from the Foreign Office :— &lt;( T i i . “ dia?/ 5, 1909. In reply to your letter of the 1st instant, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you that a telegram has been sent to His Majesty’s Minister at I eh ran, stating that you are desirous that he should be informed that by their contract with the Muin-ut-Tujjar Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. have acquired tiie monopoly of the sale of oxide extracted from Hormuz Island, and that British interests would be injured if oxide were removed from island by any party other than Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. or the Muin-ut-Tujjar. ,, 13. In order that we may not be thought to have overlooked any point disclosed by the correspondence, we refer incidentally here to the fact that in a letter dated the 21st May, 1910, the Secretary of State took up the position that the protection of the rights of Messrs. Ellinger and Co. and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. by His Majesty’s ' Government boie relation to the contingency of a confiscation of those rights by the nationalists, and did not apply to the case ol disputed validity of the Mu in’s concession, and this construction was placed by him upon the following passage in a letter dated the 3rd May, 1909 :— “ If the nationalists or anyone else but Messrs. Weir attempt to remove any of the oxide Sir G. Barclay will at once hear of it, and will take the necessary action.” This suggestion was, however, fudy answered in a letter from Messrs. Ellinger and Co. dated the 24th June, 1910, and is respectfully submitted to be inconsistent with the obviously wider obligations of His Majesty’s Government to be gathered from the whole senes of communications that have taken place and fully recognised by the letter of the 5th May, 1909, an extract from which is given above. 14. Later communications of the same year render it clear that His Majesty’s Government felt under obligation to protect the interests of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and that Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. were fully aware of the existence of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co.’s contract. 15. No question as to the validity of the Muin’s concession or the legality of his contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. arose or at all events was made known to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. until the following April (1910), when they learnt that a sale of 5,000 tons of oxide from Hormuz had been made by the Persian Government, and, on their bringing this to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, the information was confirmed as being substantially correct, and it was then for the first time also stated to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. that the Persian Government had decided that the Muin’s concession was invalid, and had declined his application for a renewal. As a further development, it became known later to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. that the Persian Government had made a five years’ contract with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. for the sale of 31,000 tons of oxide, thus tearing up the Muin’s concession and the contract made on the faith of it. 16. Communications followed between Messrs. Ellinger and Co. and His Majesty’s Government, who at that time were evidently much impressed with the statements made to Mr. Marling as to the alleged invalidity of the Muin’s concession, and were even disposed to attribute to the Muin something nearly approaching . to [1845 /— 5] , . .V • - B 2 ^ Vt fraudulent conduct, and inability on bis part to \ indicate his alleged right to a concession m P e [P^ 1 h t J grounds for fais attitude on the part of His Majesty’s Government are fully set forth in a letter from the Secretary of State to Messrs Ellinger and Co. dated the 8th July, 1910. It is not to the purpose of this memorandum to traverse, the ground of that letter in detail here, but there are some points of great important which it is desired to bring to the attention of the Secretaiy of State, and especially as some of them have reference to events subsequent in date to the letter in question (a.) The Muin was left in undisturbed possession of his concession for several years after it is alleged to have lapsed. A. reason for this has been suggested, but is quite unconvincing, especially in view of later events. (b.) The translation of the supplementary document of 1904, enclosed in a letter from the Secretary of State dated the 29th January, 190!), is submitted to be only capable of being naturally read in the sense of being a perpetual grant, and its contents were not originally regarded either by His Majesty s Government or the Persian Government as casting any doubt on the Muin s title, nor was it called in question until long after its date. 11 i i n ' i (c.) The Secretary of State was naturally influenced unfavourably by the alleged refusal of the Muin to produce documents^ establishing his rights. I his refusal af he did, in fact, so refuse) may have been unwise and calculated to create suspicion, but it has to be remembered that an Oriental merchant, who, in the prevailing condition of affairs, might naturally be expected to be suspicious of fnend and foe alike, might well have thought it undesirable to produce his documents, even to Mr. Marling. In any case the criticism has since lost much of its force if, as Messrs. Ellinger and Co. have been informed, the Muin has now published all his firmans, and circulated them among the members of the Medjliss. (d.) The Persian Government, as long ago as April last, and m spite of warnings from His Majesty’s Government of the possible consequences of their acts, took the extreme step of violating the Muin’s contract with British subjects ; but have ever since, notwithstanding all the pressure applied to them, failed to produce any evidence whatsoever to justify their action, or to put it more accurately^ they, some months ago, furnished a statement which did not contain the information required by His Majesty s Government, and have never since given that information, though pressed to do so. (e.) The information originally given to Mr. Marling, which so much impressed the Secretary of State, rests avowedly upon the authority of Vekil-ubRoaya, who is notoriously a bitter enemy of the Muin, except in so far as general confirmation is vaguely stated to have been given by the Administrator of Customs, “who had had some acquaintance with the question for s«&gt;me time past.” It may be pointed out also that the information does not appear to have been given by any of the responsible members of the Persian Government or through the usual channels. 18. The facts to which reference has just been made are submitted by^ Messrs. Ellinger and Co. to point very strongly indeed to the conclusion that, so far from the Muin having traded on a lapsed concession and concealed the fact from Messrs. Ellinger and Co. and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., in fraud of the Persian Government and of the British subjects with whom he was contracting, he is in fact the genuine owner of a concession in perpetuity, and has been deprived of his just rights by political intrigue and personal enmity, with the direct result of inflicting most serious injury upon Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. If this is thought to be putting the case for the Muin’s conces sion too high, it must at least be admitted that the case against the concession has not been even attempted to be supported by proof down to t! e present moment. 19. 'the Secretary of State has, so far, not seen his wav to take the one step which, above all others, is absolutely necessary at the present time to protec Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. from the very grave injury resulting to them from the flooding of the English market with oxide mine in defiance of their rights, by calling upon the Persian Government to suspend the further shipment of oxide until at least the question of the validity of the Mums concession is definitely decided by competent authority on proper evidence. 20 . In the letter from the Secretary of State dated the 15th December, 1910, stress is laid upon the injury that might, if this step were taken, be done to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., by whom shipments of oxide have been made continuously since April last, and in an earlier letter the position was taken up that Messrs. F. G and Co., being British subjects, were as much entitled to consideration as MessiAndrew and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. This view is submitted, with great respect, to be not maintainable, for the conclusive reason that whereas Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. are relying upon the support of His -Majesty s Government definitely and actively promised for years past, and fortified by n actual expression of opinion as to the validity of the Muin’s concession, communi- cated with express authority to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., Messrs. F. C. Strick a . n f on . contrar J» are re ^yi n ^ only upon a contract entered into at their own risk, and with direct knowledge of the prior right of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messis. Ellinger and Co. to the protection of His Majesty’s Government. Both the Bersian Government and Messrs. F. C. Strick and^ Co. were distinctly warned by His Majesty s Government, the former that they would be held responsible for any injury to Bntis interests, and the latter that His Majesty’s Government were pledged to support the contract with the Muin. The relative positions are submitted to be utterly dissimilar. J 21. This, however, does not exhaust the matter, because even on the footino- 0 f according equal treatment to conflicting British interests the present position does not represent equal treatment, but a direct preference in favour of Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. In the first place, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. feel bound to draw special attention to the fact that, so far as they are able to judge from the sequence of events, the supposed invalidity of the Muin’s concession and the possibility of the Persian Government taking forcible action on that footing in favour of Messrs. I. C. Strick and Co., with disastrous results to Messrs. Andrew AVeir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co., must have become known to His Majesty’s Government long before any communication on the subject was made to the latter firms, whose interests were vitally affected, and who were all this time relying upon the perpetuity of the concession of which they had received assurances from His Majesty’s Government, and on the faith of which the contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. was entered into. But what is much more important, Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. have been, and are being still, permitted to ship oxide into this country at their pleasure to the extreme injury of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co., in the teeth of a concession hitherto fully recognised and supported by His Majesty’s Government, the invalidity of which has not been and to all appearances cannot be proved, notwithstanding that His Majesty’s Government have been asking to have the evidence produced to them for many months pust. 22. ^ The effect of permitting oxide to be shipped by Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. in existing circumstances is for practical purposes to prejudge the question of the validity of the concession in their favour, and amounts to a withdrawal from Messrs. Andrew \Veir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. of the support to which they claim to be justly entitled, and which has been repeatedly promised to them. 23. It is particularly desired to impress upon the Secretary of State that neither Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. nor Messrs. Ellinger and Co. have any personal prejudice or feeling of hostility against Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., with whotn they are on friendly terms, and have other business relations. If that firm themselves sustain damage in consequence of the suspension or, it may be, final cancellation of the contract entered into with them, the responsibility for this does not lie with His Majesty’s Government, and Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. may well have a good claim against the Persian Government, whether for assuming a right to enter into a contract with them at all or for delaying all these months to produce the evidence which, taken in connection with all the surrounding circumstances, can alone determine the question whether the Persian Government have acted wrongly towards Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co., or towards Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., or towards all of them. The apparent antagonism between the interests of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. on the one hand and Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. cn the other hand is entirely due to and created by the action of the Persian Government, and not to anything personal as between the respective firms, but, for the reasons which have been stated, it is confidently submitted that there can be no doubt as to the prior claim of the first- mentioned firm to the protection and support of His Majesty’s Government, even though this may in a sense bring their interests into conflict with those of Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., who have deliberately risked that contingency. Moreover, it is open to very serious doubt whether the temporary cessation of shipments might not also suit Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., who are naturally unable to obtain the price for their oxide that they could command if the oxide previously shipped to this country under the Muin’s contract were not also in the market.24 For the above reasons, His Majesty’s Government are respectfully and earnestly requested to reconsider by the li^ht of all the circumstances of the case the question of insisting upon the suspension of any further shipments of oxide by Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co and the justice of requiring matters to be left tn statu quo until the question, whether the Muin’s concession is valid in perpetuity, or lapsed years before it waf interfered with at all, is settled authoritatively to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government. Incidentally, it is pointed out that if the suspension asked for is insisted upon by His Majesty’s Government, it will obviously be necessary not to give any lengthened notice of requiring suspension, as, otherwise, the Persian Government might be able to ship such a quantity of oxide before the expiration of the notice as would prevent Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellinger and Co. from gaming any relief by the taking of that step. . ir 25. In conclusion, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and Messrs. Ellmger and Co. respectfully point out that they have exercised extreme patience and forbearance in this matter from beginning to end. Every step that has been taken by them has been deliberately and carefully regulated by their anxious wish to carry out what they have clearly understood to be the views of His Majesty’s Government. They have devoted an immense amount of time and trouble, which means money as well to them, to the various phases of this matter which has been so intolerably prolonged, and in w ic t ey find themselves placed in such a serious position. r I hey ask that His Majesty s Government will now take prompt and decisive action, and thus give practical effect to the encourage ment and assurances upon which Messrs. Elfinger and Co. have so long relied, without so far obtaining any relief from the grave injury to the interests of themselves and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., which they have been and still are actively suffering, and which is being aggravated by every shipment of oxide made to this country m defiance of the monopoly expressly conceded by the Muin’s contract of the 4th December, 1908.

It is doubtful whether either of these projects will pass Medjliss, but in view of ! what Stricks are now seeking to obtain it will be to their interest to stand well with Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government, and therefore not to raise difficulties with regard to a reasonable compensation to Weir for the violation of their contract with Muin.

Persian Government have sent a note stating merely that when concluding a contract with Strict and Co. Persian Government considered the Muin’s lease to have expired Furthermore, the note cites article 12 of Strict’s contract, and concludes bv saying that In these circumstances you. will admit that, if Weir have anything to sav Strict must, m accordance with this article, be responsible.” . ^ n ^ ster fr? r Finance has also, in virtue of the same article, officially requested Strict s agent here to enter into communication with the Muin in order to ascertain and settle the amount of the lawful claims on the Muin in respect of the latter’s existing contract. Article in question runs thus :— “ Sellers agree to give the buyers 1,000 tons of oxide free on board, and the buyers undertake full responsibility for any lawful claim Messrs. Weir or Ellino-er mav have on sellers or on the Muin under the existing contract for oxide between Weir and the Mum, so that neither sellers nor the Muin shall be put to any loss on this account ” (End of R.) It is therefore evident that any claim pressed for by us on behalf of Wbir and Ellingei will be counteiclaimed against Stnck. Latter will very possibly dispute “ lawfulness ” of our claim, and Persian Government, or the Muin, as the case may be will presumably sue him in English courts. It is therefore highly desirable that we should be thoroughly satisfied that any claim advanced by us on the ground of illegal proceedings would be upheld by British tribunal. I think it would be well to ascertain from Strick what attitude they propose to adopt towards W eir and Ellinger’s claim, and if necessary to impress upon all these parties that, in view of complexity of the case and its doubtful issue, they should compound their conflicting interests under the arbitration of Board of Trade or other impartial body. I understand privately that Persian Government, under pressure of the Muin’s friends now take line that, his original lease having expired and no term having been fixed in the Muin’s second firman, his lease could, under Persian law, be revoked at any moment, but that, as his taxes were accepted up to 21st March, 1910, he must be compensated at rate of 42s. 6d. per ton for the value of oxide seized by Customs which had been mined before that date. Consequently Stricks have been requested to pay the Muin 20s. out of the 40s. payable to Persian Government on every ton shipped by them until 24,000h has been paid to him. This would seem to admit Muin s right in 1908 to make at least temporary contracts, while his supplementary agreement with Weir (see Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 146 of the 7th August), which, I hear, he means to invoke, might %e &lt; interpreted to cover his responsibility if his contract for further delivery was interfered with by the revocation of his lease.

I do not see how, in face of our caveats, shipments of oxide can prejudice case in favour of Persian Government, and Weir’s market is bound to be spoilt sooner or later unless we insist on cancellation of Strick’s contract, which I presume you would not see your way to do even though Persian Government were to fail to substantiate their case. A merely temporary stoppage of Strick’s shipments would appear to be of only slight benefit to Weir, while it would give Strick ground for claim against Persian Government, and such a claim, though apparently just one, could obviously not have our support if we had pressed for stoppage. Moreover, would not compliance with Ellinger’s demands at this stage be in some measure admission that we ought to have prevented conclusion of Strick’s contract ? 152—49 &gt; COPY TO INDIA1 CONFIDENTIAL. b 1:1 JANI9JJ Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

I AM^directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a memorandum on the subject of the claims of Messrs. Weir and Messrs Ellinger in connection with the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession for mining red oxide on the island of Hormuz, and to state that the conclusions therein set forth will be communicated to the latter of the two firms. It is evident that this communication will elicit from Messrs. Ellinger a defence of their previous contentions, which will probably give rise to a considerable amount of discussion between that firm and the Board on purely technical points, on which this department would not be competent to express an opinion, and in the decision of which it could hardly be of any assistance. I am accordingly to suggest that direct discussion of this question should take place, on the basis of your letter under reply, either by correspondence or, still better, by personal interviews between representatives of the Board and of Messrs. Ellinger, a course by which, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, a useless expenditure of time and trouble would be avoided. If the Board of Trade were willing to accept this suggestion, a representative of this department could, if it were thought desirable, be deputed to attend at any discussions which might take place, though, in view of the nature of the questions to be treated, it is doubtful whether his presence on such occasions would serve any useful purpose, and it might be enough if the terms of the settlement eventually reached were communicated officially by the Board to Sir E. Grey. Before, therefore, communicating further with Messrs. Ellinger on the subject of their claim, Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn whether the Board of Trade would be willing to adopt the proposed course, and would consent to the suggestion being made to that firm. With regard to the last paragraph of your letter, I am to say that Sir E. Grey is quite prepared to exhort Messrs. Ellinger to come to terms with Messrs. Strick, although unsuccessful negotiations between the two firms have already taken place. He would, however, prefer not to use to the former firm the language suggested, to the effect that “ His Majesty’s Government can only undertake to continue to support them provided that they show a reasonable readiness to abate all extreme features of their claim.” In their treatment of this question hitherto, Messrs. Ellinger have shown no signs of unreasonableness or impatience, and they will doubtless be willing to reduce the amount of their claim, if the justice of such a course can be demonstrated. A communication of the kind proposed would, moreover, be likely to give Messrs. Ellinger the impression that His Majesty’s Government were hesitating to fulfil the obligations assumed towards them, and, by irritating them, to render them less disposed to follow any advice which may be offered to them. As regards the suggested warning to Messrs. Strick that “ the support of His Majesty’s Government in any difficulties which may arise in Persia cannot be accorded to them unless they carry out, both in the spirit and in the letter, their obligation to the Persian Government with regard to the claims of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger in connection with the Muin,” I am to observe that that firm have never received, nor even solicited, any assurance of support from His Majesty’s Government in connection with this question, and are fully prepared to accept, unaided, the risks which they know r to be involved in the course adopted by them, so that an intimation of this kind would have no effect. There is, moreover, no evidence that Messrs. Strick have any intention of evading their obligations, and they might justly resent such a warning as an imputation on their good faith. I am to add that Sir E. Grey is unaware of the precise terms of the agreement [1805/-l] jconcluded between tbe Persian Government and Messrs. Strict, of which he has not seen the text, and of the exact nature and extent of the obligations, above referred to, assumed by that firm, of the existence of which he has no official knowledge. _ I am accordingly to suggest that it would be well to avoid all reference to this subject in correspondence or verbal discussion with Messrs. Ellingcr. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.m JThis Document is the Property of His Britanni c Majesty’s Government.] . ^ your lettei of the jveniber, enclosing copy of correspondence m connection with the Muin-ut-Tujjars concession for mining red oxide at Hormuz in the Peisian Gulf, I am directed by the Board of Trade to forward to you the enclosed memorandum in which the principal points raised are discussed so far as they relate to the amount of the claim of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger. . Tlle Board are of opinion that it should be possible to arrange a reasonablo compro mise both (1) as to the disposition of stocks of the oxide held by Messrs. Weir and (2) as to the amount to be paid by Messrs. Strick on the one hand, and to be received by Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger on the other. As regards the second point, the 1,000 tons of free oxide assigned in this connection by the Persian Government to Messrs Strick may be valued at 2,000/. f.o.b. Hormuz, while the amount to which the claims of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger are probably reducible may be nut at about 4,000/. j r The Board therefore venture to suggest, for the consideration of Sir E. Grey, that the firms should be strongly urged to arrive at a mutual agreement, and that, if necessary, Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger might be warned that His Majesty’s Government can only undertake to continue to support them provided that they show a reasonable readiness to abate all extreme features of their claim ; while in regard to Messrs. Strick it might be intimated to that firm the support of His Majesty’s Government in any difficulties which may arise in Persia cannot be accorded to them unless they carry out, both in the spirit and in the letter, their obligation to the Persian Government with regard to the claims of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger in connection with their contract with the Muin. IN considering the proper amount at which the losses of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger in respect of the non-continuance of their supplies of red oxide from Hormuz should be estimated, it is desirable to determine, inter alia, the average selling- value and laying-down cost in Europe of the ore. (a.) In regard to the average selling value, the data contained in Print 35373 do the propriety of estimating for so large a proportion of the total sales as shown in Enclosure 4 being made at the prices charged to what are practically retail buyers. The assignment of sales approximately in the proportions of the specimen invoices would yield a lower average price than the 73s. 8d. claimed, and the records of sales for (say) a complete year would appear to be necessary to establish the proper propor- taken as realising these prices respectively. The distribution of estimated sale prices in the proportions of the stocks held at Avonmouth and Nordenham does not appear to be fully justified by the papers produced, and further light on the proper proportions to assume in any calculation is needed, such as the records of a complete year’s sales might afford. (b.) With reference to the laying-down cost in Europe, it is assumed in Messrs. Ellinger’s calculations (Enclosure 14 in Print 35373) that the freight to PERSIA. U 12 J AMI 911 [December 17.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [45505] No. 1. Board of Irade to Foreign Office.—(Received December 17.) * 'V ' — Board of Trade, December 16, 1910. Sir, GEO. J. STANLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Board of Trade. not appear to be fully adequate to determine the average to within a shilling or two. The details of sales cover only a part of a year, and do not afford sufficient evidence of tion between the sales in large lots at relatively low prices and those in small lots at relatively high prices, as also to establish the proportions in which sales should be [1805 r—4] OPY TC2 ;&gt;r. Nordenham and to Avonmoutli is tlie same. Enclosure 15 does not afford any evidence on this point, nor does Enclosure 17, which merely shows that marine insurance is the same on the two voyages. On the other hand, the second of the agreements made with the Muin in 1908 (see No. (2), p. 5, of Print 27228) definitely sets out a higher freight to Nordenham than to Avonmouth, viz., 17s. per ton to the former, f &gt; 15s. per ton to the latter. Whether such a difference between the two voyages, or an identity in the freight charges be the normal condition of affairs, is not shown by the papers produced, and the point is of importance in determining the proper average cost of the ore in Europe. Further, port charges at Bristol are dealt with, but those at Nordenham are not fully shown, and, in the absence of definite evidence, it does not appear safe to assume an identity in average weight and landing charges at the two ports, especially as the higher sale prices in Germany raise some presumption of a higher laying-down cost. (c.) The average gross profit to be reasonably assumed as falling to Messrs. Weir in the absence of any interference with their contract depends on the results of any variation in the estimates of average sale prices and average costs in accordance with the suggestions made above. It is to be observed that the average sale price at Avonmouth is estimated by them at barely 715. per ton, and their figures of cost, applying solely to Avonmouth, amount to GOs. 11 d. per ton. The average profit thus shown (even with their assumed proportion of sales at the higher price (77s. 6d.)) is but a fraction over 10s. per ton in place of the 12s. 9d. claimed. They, in fact, appear to be assuming a profit of 17s. 4d. per ton on sales from the Nordenham stock, and this claim should be supported by evidence beyond that hitherto produced. It is also to be noted that the estimated sales to Messrs. Holzapfel from the Nordenham stock involve the sellers in an outlay for freight to Newcastle (3s. 8d. per ton) over and above the laying-down cost at Nordenham. If those costs were 60s. lid., the profit on the Newcastle sales would be not 76s. 4d. less 60s. lid. as shown, ke., 15s. 5d. per ton, but 11s. 9d. per ton, the laying-down cost at Newcastle being 60s. lid. plus 3s. 8d. so far as shown. With reference to the amount of the claim of Messrs. Weir, the oxide in stock affords an offset to claims in respect of costs incurred and ordinary profit on the amount of that stock. The 5,218 tons, the balance of the 18,000 tons secured to Messrs. Weir under their contract, remains to be considered, and if the rate of profit on this should, on closer investigation, be taken at less than the 12s. 9d. per ton claimed, as seems quite possible, the claim on this head would be correspondingly reduced. At 10s. per ton it would be 2,609L in place of the 3,326L 9s. 6d. claimed. With reference to the claim of Messrs. Ellinger, the commission on the balance of the contract actually made with the Main appears a reasonable claim and forms the first item of their account, 554i. 8s The remainder of their claim is in respect of the termination of their agency owing to the apparent illegality of the Muin’s position. The standing contract was to terminate on the 1st April, 1912. Messrs. Ellinger were thus made aware of the cessation of their agency nearly two years before the expiration of the current term, namely, as early as the 10th April, 1910. Any claim relating to losses arising out of the termination of the agency in 1912 would appear therefore to lack sound basis. In respect of the period between the 10th April, 1910, and the 1st April, 1912, the anticipated commission on the oxide covered by the actual contract between the Muin and Messrs. Weir has been dealt with above. Deliveries beyond this amount must have been in excess of the contract, though Messrs. Ellinger might not unreasonably have expected to secure deliveries to be made through their agency and within the period of the contract to such an amount as they might expect to sell without swamping the market. What would have been the amount of such extra deliveries must be matter of conjecture. Messrs. Strick have by their contract secured 6,000 tons per year, together with an extra 1,000 tons. As their contract was not made till May 1910, the deliveries up to the 1st April, 1912, may be taken at little over 12,000 tons, of which 5,218 tons may be treated as in substitution for the unde livered part of Messrs. Weir’s contract. The anticipated extra supplies, the sale of which might have been expected to be made through Messrs. Ellinger’s agency kad the Muin been able to fulfil his contract, may therefore be taken at about 7,000 tons. As Messrs. Strick have secured their supply at 40s. per ton, a commission at 5 perCFCWHffl i!S( )er iIS' ■ m ‘ ’tie % W 0 P%l; ,^resis|. ! costs were!’ lid. $ sk castle beMil the 12s. If fens if cen* would amount to 1001 . on 7,000 tons, while, if Messrs. Weir’s contract price of 4 - s - 1x3 taken as the basis of computation, the commission would be 7431. 15s. It may be observed that Messrs. Ellinger claim (Print 35373) that the rate of consm^tion had been well over 8,000 tons per year in 1909. As Messrs. Strict would able under their contract to supply only 6,000 tons annually (and a special amount a u t° ns &gt; against which the cessation of shipments for a month after the 10th April, 1910, must be considered) there would appear to be no adequate reason for a depression of prices injurious to the owners of the ore if Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Strict abstain from an entirely unnecessary competition. If the alleged rate of consumption be maintained, the stocks of both could probably be sold without fully meeting the demand at the prices current in 1909. It may further be observed that the price of 40s. at which Messrs. Strict secure the ore, as compared with 42s. 6d. the price charged Messrs. Weir, appears to cover the commission which, in the latter case, was a deduction from the yield to the Muin. After meeting Messrs. Ellinger’s 5 per cent., the Muin netted 40s. 4Jd. per ton. In the absence of information as to division of weighing charges between Messrs. Strict and ^ the Persian Grovernment, it cannot be precisely determined whether the latter receives net even so much as 4^d. per ton less than the Muin contracted for with Messrs. Weir. The allowance of 1,000 tons free made by the Persian Grovernment to Messrs. Strict would appear to provide the source from which this firm can cover the obligation into which it entered, to accept responsibility for any lawful claim on the part of Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger. Summary of Estimated Losses on the Basis of the Foregoing. £ s. d. Messrs. Weir s loss of profit on 5,218 tons, if taken at 10s. per ton (see above) .. .. .. .. .. .. 2,609 0 0 Messrs.

No. 1. Foreign Office to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. Gentlemen, Foreign Office, December 15, 1910. 1 AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the question of the mines of red oxide on the island of Hormuz. In this communication you give an account of the circumstances in which this question^ arose and of the events which have affected its development up to the present time. This account appears to Sir E. Grey to present a fair statement of the case and of its present situation. You urge at the same time that the Persian Government should be required without further delay to furnish evidence that Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession did in fact lapse at a given date as they assert, and that, until this question is settled, all further shipments of oxide from Hormuz should be discontinued. . ^Vhh regard to the former request, I am to observe that, as you are aware, His Majesty s Minister at Tehran has already informed the Persian Government officially that, unless they can produce proof satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government that Mum s concession expired previously to the signature of his contract with yourselves and with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., they will be held responsible for any injury to British interests caused by their action in disregarding that contract. I am to inform you, however, that, as the Persian Government have hitherto failed to reply to Sir G. Barclay’s communication by furnishing the proof demanded, Sir E. Grey, who fully recognises the urgency of the matter and the reasonable nature of your request, has instructed him by telegraph to make a further serious representa tion to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject, and to point out to his Excellency the heavy pecuniary liability to which his Government are exposing them selves by their omission to bring forward conclusive evidence of their contention. As regards 3 r our second request, I am to observe that it is quite true that, as stated, in your letter, Messrs. Strick have acted in this matter with full knowledge of the circumstances of the case and of the risk of loss to themselves which would be involved in a failure on the part of the Persian Government to prove that Muin’s concession lapsed as they assert. Messrs. Strick are also aware of the undertakings given by His Majesty’s Government to yourselves and to Messrs. Weir, and have themselves never received or even solicited any promise of support. If, however. His Majesty’s Government were now to comply with your second request by compelling the Persian Government to suspend all further shipments of oxide from Hormuz, they would be assuming the falsity of the contention put forward by the Persian Government just as definitely as they wordd have assumed its accuracy had they declined to furnish Sir G. Barclay with instructions to make on your behalf the representations referred to earlier in this letter. Such action would, moreover, involve definite opposition to Messrs. Strick, who, though they have, as above stated, no claim to official support from His Majesty’s Government, cannot justly be exposed to official hostility. Should the Persian Government, through the action of His Majesty’s Government, refuse to permit Messrs. Strick to make any further shipment of oxide which, in accordance with any agreement that they may have entered into, they may wish to effect, and should it be subsequently proved (as indeed is highly probable) that the contention of tyhe Persian Government is accurate, the British firm would have, it appears to Sir E. Grey, good grounds for a complaint that their financial and commercial interests had been prejudiced by such action. I am accordingly to inform you that, in view of these considerations, Sir E. Grey feels unable to comply with your second request. M ith reference to the penultimate paragraph of your letter, adducing as evidence in favour of the justice of Muin’s concession the fact that he was left in undisturbed possession of the rights which he claims for some time after his concession is asserted by the Persian Government to have expired, I am to point out that an explanation [1805 p—1] • 3 o £Z in i f m(which may or may not he the true one) of this circumstance was furnished to Mr. Marling last June by Vekil-el-Roaya. This explanation is embodied in Mr. Langley’s letter to you of the 8th July, and is to the effect that Muin had been able to profit by the confusion which reigned in Persia at the moment of the expiration of his concession and which has since continued, and had found means of silencing by intimidation or bribery the few persons who knew the facts. rt I am, &amp;e.

The writer understands that the further note asked for has not yet been received m spite of the considerable lapse of time, and, meanwhile, the action of the Persian Government, relatively to the oxide concession, itself is making the situation more and more injurious to the interests of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves as there is imminent danger of further shipments taking place in violation of the Mum’s contract with Messrs Andrew Wem and Co., which would come on a market already flooded with the oxide shipped by Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. The view that we submit respectfully is that m common justice to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves as British subjects, the Persian Government should be required without further delay to give evidence, which has never yet been forthcoming, that the um-ut-lujjars concession has lapsed, and that in the meantime the rights of those who have relied m all good faith upon that concession ought not to be prejudiced by still further shipments of oxide being made under the contract obtained by Messrs Strick The course adopted by the Persian Government of acting as if the concession were void* while at the same time neglecting to give proof to satisfy His Majesty’s Government that it is void, cannot be logically or justly sustained, and is a denial of justice and an accumulating aggravation of the injury to us and our friends. We would respectfully remind you that the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession must be either valid or invalid. If it is valid then every ton of oxide shipped by Messrs. Frank C. “trick and Co. is a violation of the rights of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, and the Muin-ut-Tujjar is clearly entitled to be restored to his original position and allowed to carry out the contract made with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and they and we are further^ entitled to be compensated for the injury sustained in consequence of the concession having been treated as void and forcibly terminated. If, on the other hand, the concession can be shown to be void, then we fall back upon the protection of His Majesty s Government on the grounds which are fully set forth in our letter to you of the 24th June last, supplemented later by our letter of the 29th September, as regards the detailed claims of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves. It has been intimated that His Majesty’s Government must preserve an even balance between two British subjects, but we have to point out that there is no question of equality of treatment of ourselves and Mr. F. C. Strick in this matter if the Muin’s concession cannot be shown to have lapsed. Mr. Strick’s oxide contract with the Persian Government was made long after the contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., with full knowledge of the existence of the contract between the Muin and [1805 m—4] £2NVtlfcJhMiA— a*. this firm and of risk he was running should the Muin’s right to the concession be established, and after being twice told he could not rely upon support from His Majesty’s Government, who were pledged to support us, and we venture to submit without hesitation that from first to last the whole sequence of events shows that upon a conflict of interest Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves are, on every principle of^ fairness, entitled to ask for this support in preference-to any claims of Mr. Strick, based/ as his are, and can only be upon a contract which he knew to be made in violation of the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession. As bearing upon the merits of the question of the validity of the concession, we would point out that if, as has been asserted, it lapsed in 1906, the Muin-ut-Tujjar was left in undisturbed possession of his supposed rights, and we were allowed to act as his agents for the sale of oxide and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. to enter into a contract for taking the oxide at a considerably later date. We venture on all these grounds to submit that to allow the Muin’s concession and his contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. to continue to be set aside and oxide to be poured into this country under a contract which manifestly cannot be supported if the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession is upheld, while at the same time the Persian Government, notwithstanding pressure from His Majesty’s Government, continues indefinitely to delay furnishing any evidence whatever in support of the view that the concession is invalid, is to place Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves in an intolerably unjust position, and we urge respectfully, but most strongly, that at least the status quo should be preserved, and the shipments of oxide discontinued, until the whole matter is cleared up and it is definitely ascertained whether the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession is or is not valid.

To explain the nature of he c aim, it is necessary briefly to recapitulate certain facts regarding the Muin’s concession minino’ rio-Tifa in TTrv^ 1 J e ivium s concession, which covered mining rights m Hormuz was in perpetuity. The precise terms of the concession were not however, known to His Ma esty’s Legation at Tehran.

In order to prevent their endeavourr^ bein^ Sgerlnd 0^0^01,0 f ^ 'tp 6 Mui “- ut - T 'ij^^ agents in England, Messrs ngei and ho., oi Manchester, with a measure of support from this department to bring about the formation of a company in this country for the purpose of exploiting the red oxide deposits m the island. The Muin at this time came to His Maiestvf res&amp;v^est'h 1 *^' h Abbas Kuli Khan, the Oriental secretary, a firmaT and rescript by the Shah which purported to be his concession, and which in fact made it appear that the concession was; perpetual. In the general disorganisation“f the 1 Government further confirmation was impossible, and Messrs. Ellinger for the purposes mentioned above, were informed “that so far as His Majesty’s Government are aware the concession to the Mum is in perpetuity. The firman and rescript confirming it have been seen at the British Legation at Tehran.” This communication was to be regarded as private and confidential, and only to be shoX to ners™s approved by the Secretary of State. Messrs. Ellinger and Co. failed in their efforts to Andrew Weifand Co ''A ^'T 1 of the Forei g n approached Messrs. , . 1: ' ' ! an „London, and a contract was entered into between Messrs and the Muin for working the oxide mines atXhuz and disposing of the mineral.

In ‘ he course of f^t winter the Muin’s concession has been made the subject of investigation by a Persian commission conducted by Vekil-ul-Roya, the deputy i . amadan, a man with a high reputation for integrity, ability and patriotism this a u m ii ervie \ Mr. Marling, then His Majesty’s charge d’affkires it Tehran; gentleman has explained that the Muin’s concession really expired in 1905 The document exhibited by him to Abbas Kuli Khan was in realhy a supplementary firman which was granted to him m 1903, modifying certain terms of toe original giant, but by no means extending its duration. The full circumstances of the apparent fleception practised by the Muin, as explained by Vekil-ul-Roya are set forth m Mr. Marling s despatch N 0j 72 of the 14th May (Enclosure C). The Mum-ut-Tujjar has strenuously denied toe truth of these statements, but though repeatedly called on to produce the original text of his concession and prove fts validity, he has steadfastly refused to do so. The Persian Government, considering that their hands were freed as a result of these disclosures, have sold oxide to Messis. F. C.

CONFIDENTIAT, S [35373] Sir, aJ [ September 30.] 1G NOVI 910 Section 5. M\ No. 1. Messrs. Ellinger and Co. to Foreign Office.—(Received September 30.) 28, Oxford Street, Manchester, September 29, 1910. OWING to the time of the year and the absence of the present writer, there has been some unavoidable delay in replying to your letter of the 19th August. A our letter deals separately with the views of Sir Edward Grey upon the respective claims of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, and we will adopt the same order and take his observations point by point, dealing first with the claim of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. :— 1. Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. fully appreciate the fact that, for the purpose of arriving at au exact figure of claim, the amount realised by an actual sale of the oxide would enable one side of the calculation to be fixed more definitely than in any other possible w r ay, but they wish us to point out that anything in the nature of an immediate forced sale of the oxide would, in their view and ours, be very prejudicial to the best interests of the Persian Government or the Muin, as the case may be, because the amount of the claim would thereby be increased, and of Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., who would be prejudiced by the flooding of the market with oxide at a forced sale price. At the same time Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. are quite prepared to carry out the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in this respect if, after consideration of the circumstances we have pointed out, it is still thought necessary that a sale of the oxide should take place as a preliminary step to fixing the amount of their claim, on the understanding, of course, that the interests of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. shall not be prejudiced, and in the meantime no opportunity is being missed of making any possible sale at a reasonable price. 2. Sir Edward Grey’s second point relates to the other side of the calculation. Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. fully appreciate the fact that in order to arrive at a just calculation there must be a fair comparison between the value, whether realised by sale, as suggested by Sir Edward Grey, or not, of the oxide under present circumstances and the sale of the oxide had Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co.’s contract been left undisturbed and worked out in the ordinary and natural course of business. So far as any question of fluctuation of value enters into the latter part of this comparison, it is probably enough for us to say at this moment that there never has been for years past any reduction in the market value of oxide due to trade causes, and, on the contrary, that it has consistently increased in market value. This can be shown to demonstration before any tribunal or to the satisfaction of any impartial person. We will only add on this point that Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. are, of course, fully prepared to justify the calculations of value contained in the statement of their claim already before Sir Edward Grey, and we append evidence to this effect (see Enclosures 1 to 19). 3. When Air. M. Ellinger had the pleasure of discussing matters with Mr. Norman, ou the 9th instant, the former suggested that, under the circumstances, it might be advisable that in the meantime a settlement should be pressed for of item 3 of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co.’s claim and also of our claims, and that settlement of items 1 and 2 of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co.’s claim should be applied for as soon as the question is definitely settled as to the form the claim should take. Mr. Norman appeared to think this course quite practicable, and we respectfully ask that it be adopted. With regard to the observations of Sir Edward Grey upon our own claim, we have to submit the following replies :— 4. —(1.) It is quite true, as stated by Sir Edward Grey, that the documents forwarded by us do not on the face of them establish our right to commission in express terms, but we would point out that we are joined as parties to both the agreements with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. in the character of agents of the Muin, and this of itself inferentially justifies a claim of commission, seeing that we could hardly be supposed to take an active part in connection with the sale of the [2894 gg —5] B■jkMtssas^ssii || t | |! 11 IliH ^ fi J ; r • ti 1 1 i ^ ' *; | Hi 11 &amp; 1 oxide and the representation of the interests of the Mum here without any remuneration. As a matter of fact, however, we are able to say positively that we have since the year 1900, by arrangement between ourselves and Muin, received a commission at the rate of 5 per cent, upon all sales of oxide, the rate having been in pre\ ions years 1 per cent., then 2 b per cent., and ultimately 5 per cent., and in each case by express arrangement* We have not preserved the old correspondence, but our ledgers corroborate oui statement, and we enclose a copy of a letter received fiom the Mum, dated the 29th December, 1908 (see Enclosure 20), from which it will be seen that the Muin expressly recognised our right to 5 per cent, commission on oxide. We further enclose copies^of letters (see Enclosures 21 to 24) in the years 1907, 1908, 1909, and 1910, in which we advised him that we have charged him 5 per cent, commission on oxide sold under contracts with Messrs. E. G. Strick and Co. and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. , . . We trust that this statement will be accepted as justilying our position so far as the question of the right to commission at the particular rate claimed is concerned. (2.) Sir Edward Grey suggests that any commission to which we may be entitled should* be recovered by us from the Muin. It may be that theoretically we have a right of action against the Muin, but we would point out that our claim to commission stands upon exactly the same principle in this respect as the claim of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. Their grievance is that they have sustained a loss because the oxide which they contracted to buy has not been delivered. Our grievance is that we have sustained a loss by not receiving the commission that we should have received if the oxide had been delivered. In both cases alike the non-delivery of the oxide is the root of the claim, and the non-delivery is due to the action of the Persian Government, and we respectfully submit that His Majesty’s Government are under obligations to see that we are indemnified, regard being had to all the special circumstances of this matter, which we have already fully laid before Sir Edward Grey. ^ 4he fact that we are entitled in this respect to the same protection by His Majesty’s Government as Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., was fully recognised in Mr. Langley’s letter to us of the 20th July last. . . . , . 01 nAAi (3.) Sir Edward Grey distinguishes our position with regard to the 31,000 tons referred to in the second item of our claim from the first item of claim which depends upon the contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. In the first place, we wish frankly to admit that we cannot, and do not, claim as an actual matter of contract between the Muin and ourselves that we are entitled to a claim of commission, as such, upon this particular quantity of 31,000 tons. Our position broadly is that we have been for many years the accredited agents of the Muin, and had every possible reason to suppose that we should continue to occupy that position, and to occupy it with special relation to the fact that the Muin nad a perpetual concession, and a monopoly of Hormuz oxide. In the ordinary course of business further sales of oxide to a very much greater extent than 31,000 tons would have been made by him, through us as his agents, and we should have received a commission accordingly. The assurances of His Majesty’s Government and of the Muin-ut-Tujjar that the latter’s concession was in perpetuity led us to regard ourselves as interested parties, not only within the limits of the oxide to he delivered under one contract for a short term of years, but induced us to make untiring efforts to complete such arrangements with regard to the future disposal of oxide as would ensure the retention of this business for a long term of years in British hands, and we may venture to say that no one knows better than Sir Edward Grey himself, the immense amount of trouble and attention that we devoted to this subject. It is self- evident that we should not have been satisfied with the remuneration represented &gt; commission upon a contract for the sale of a comparatively small quantity of oxide, i we had not had every reason to believe that the Muin had a perpetual concession. Our claim is really in the nature of compensation for services rendered in our negotiations for the future sale of oxide, and (or for disturbance) also for obvious damage to our commercial credit for having been allowed to offer on the Lon on market a property, the title to which is now suggested to be entirely bad, and to Ene been upheld by fraudulent means. In assessing this claim at an amount represen mg the equivalent of commission upon a quantity of oxide that has actually ^ eeil p 0 )g already over and beyond the quantity included in Messrs. Andrew Weir and o.^ contract, and during the currency of their contract, we submit that we have place^ very moderate assessment upon the compensation, to which, in all justice, we _ entitled for having our agency swept away owing to the action of the rersi Government.^nll G °™™“ e “t a r e st ! u delaying preparation of the promised note, we be glad to hear that His Majesty s Government will nevertheless now proceed to WeiranclCo y &amp; Settlement ° f 0Ur claims and those of Messr S P Andrew &gt; We are, &amp;c.

The particular shade is required by the trade, and has steadily grown m favour, as is manifested by the growth in consumption, i • 6 * 0U ° W1 ^ ^S ures are submitted as evidence of the growth in consumption c uring the period of years in which we sold the oxide to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., i.e. :— trom the 1st January, 1902, to the 31st December, 1906, the averag-e consumption was .. .. .. .. From the 1st January, 1907, to the 10th April,” 1910, the averag-e consumption was Tons. 4,676 7.446 whereas during the period in which we sold the oxide to Messrs. Weir and Co.— From the 1st January, 1909, to the 10th April, 1910, the average annual Tons, consumption was . .. .. _ ^ g ggQ (N.B. The 10th April, 1910, was the date on which the contract was bioken Ip the purchase of o,000 tons from the Persian Government by Messrs. Stiick.) It is evident from the above figures that the growth of cod sumption has been continuous, and still continues. As evidence of the growth of prices paid to the Muin-ut-Tujjar, the following are the selling prices of successive contracts made by us for him with Messrs’ F. C. Strick and Co. :— Contract for Two Years. Dated the 21st December, 1901 Contract for One Year. Dated the 21st December, 1903 „ 21st December, 1904 „ 1st December, 1905 .. „ 12th November, 1906 Price was— s. d. 27 6 per ton, f.o.b., Hormuz. 32 0 35 6 42 6 42 6 &gt;5 53 33 33 3 3 3 ’ 33 3 ? 33 33 33 We have no evidence of the prices obtained by Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., but we know from what buyeis have told us that they have paid steadilv increasing prices. The following is submitted as evidence that it was reasonable to expect a growth • m price payable to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. : On the 10th April, 1910, the stock was 6,835 tons, and there remained still to be shipped 5,218 tons before expiration of the contract on the 31st March, 1912, which would have given a supply of 12,053 tons, whilst the probable consumption, on the above-mentioned annual average of 8,386 tons, would equal 16,422 tons, an excess of demand over supply to the amount of 4,369 tons. It was appareat that there would have been a scarcity of oxide towards the conclusion of the contract, and that this would have enabled Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. to conimand higher prices for their product. In formulating Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. s claim under item 3, the actual prevailing selling prices have been taken, with the exception of those obtained from the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company and Messrs. C. K. Williams and Co., Easton. These two firms,’ which had been specially favoured as regards prices by Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., were4 obtaining the product at prices considerably below those paid by their competitors, and, with a view to the fact that it would be impossible to supply the whole market with its requirements for the complete period of the contract, it had already been decided to advance the prices required from these two firms, so as to reduce the advantage that they were obtaining over their competitors, an increase in price having- already been obtained from the other consumers in this country. The Golden Valley had already been advised that a higher price would be required for future business, and we enclose copies of the letters,'dated the 25th November, 1909 and the 23rd March, 1910 (see Enclosures 2 and 3). We had satisfied ourselves that Messrs. C. K. Williams and Go. were selling the oxide in the United States to consumers, whom we visited there, at 22 dollars per ton, equal to 91s. Sd. per ton, and had they not been willing to pay us the required advance we had made arrangements to sell direct to consumers. Had Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. been left in uninterrupted control of the business for the remaining period of the contract, sales would have been effected to the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company and C. Iv. Williams and Co. at the rate of 70s. per ton, f.o.i. We attach particulars (see Enclosure 4) showing you how the average selling price of 73s. Sd. per ton is arrived at, and further a sheet (see Enclosure 14) showing how the cost, f.o.r., of 60s. lid. per ton is obtained. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Messrs.

CONFIDENTIAL. y [27228] Messrs. Ellinger and Co. to Foreign Office.—(Received July 27.) Sir, _ 28. Oxford Street, Manchester, July 26, 1910. WE are in receipt of yours of the 20th instant, and are pleased to see that Sir Edward Grey sees no objection to our proposal to communicate the correspondence referred to by us in our letter of the 12th instant to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and the Mouintudjar, aud that he understands from the last paragraph of our letter that we have already acted on the suggestion so far as the former are concerned. This was so, as there was no doubt in Mr. M. Ellinger’s mind that Mr. Norman was quite clear on this point, but he wished to be quite certain that it was clearly understood that he proposed also to send the correspondence to the Mouintudjar. We note also the circumstances under which the copy of the firman of 1904 was handed to Abbas Kuli Khan. We beg to express to His Majesty’s Government our thanks for the assurance of diplomatic support which will be given to our endeavours to recover the sum we have lost through the breach of the contract signed by us as the Mouintudjar’s agents with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. The contract between Mouintudjar, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., and ourselves was handed to Mr. Mallet at the interview between that gentleman, Mr. Maxwell, Mr. William Weir, and Mr. M. Ellinger, but to the best of our belief Mr. Mallet did not read it. We therefore now hand you the contract herewith for your perusal, and we shall he glad if you will kindly let us have an acknowledgment of its safe receipt. With reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter, we take the liberty of pointing out that we have already put forward and sent to you with our letter of the 24th June the claim of both Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, and we shall be quite prepared to furnish such evidence as you may require to prove the justifi cation of the items, and that the amounts claimed are not excessive. As however Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. are not prepared, and cannot be expected, to hold the oxide which is at present in stock for any lengthy period, we shall be glad if you will expedite matters as much as possible. We are, &amp;c. ELLINGER and Co. Enclosure in No. 1. Agreements between the Mouintudjar, Messrs. Ellinger and Co., and Messrs. A. Weir and Co. ( 1 .) An Agreement made the fourth day of December, one thousand nine hundred and eioht, between Haji Agha Mohamed Mouintudjar, of Bushire and Teheran, Persia (hereinafter called the seller), of the first part, and Messieurs Ellinger and Company, of Manchester (hereinafter called the agents for the seller), of the second part, and Messieurs Andrew Weir and Company, of 6, Lloyd’s Avenue, London, E.C. (herein after called the buyers), of the third part, whereby it is agreed as follows 1. The seller agrees to sell and the buyers to buy at the price of forty-two shillings and sixpence per ton free on board about eighteen thousand tons of red oxide mined or to be mined at Ormux and to be of the usual quality of red oxide hitherto shipped at Ormuz for London, which the buyers undertake to sell unmixed with any other oxide or material. The buyers shall not be entitled to reject any stuff tendered to them as red oxide at Ormuz, but their acceptance shall not prejudice any claim on their part either for not being usual quality or for short shipment, and they shall forthwith receive such allowance as may be agreed or determined by arbitration.

Should such vessel not arrive at Ormuz within three days of the date nominated, the buyers shall pay to the agents for the seller six pounds sterling each day after the date nominated to cover the cost of maintenance of coolies at Ormuz until the vessel arrives at Ormuz, or until the buyers advise the seller that they are prevented from sending their steamer to load at Ormuz. . 3. The seller undertakes that from the date hereof until the first day of April, one thousand nine hundred and twelve, no oxide shall be sold 01 shipped by the seller directly or indirectly or by anyone acting under his direction or control for Europe or America, other than (a) the oxide hereby bought and sold ; (b) oxide for consumption in India,' which last-mentioned oxide the seller warrants shall not so far as it is in his power to prevent the same he exported thence, directly or indiiectly, to Europe or America. The seller can at any any time ship oxide to Russia by Russian steamers that touch the ports of the Persian Gulf, and it is agreed that for any quantity the seller may ship before expiration of this contract to Russia, ho must pay to the buyers five shillings per ton, and it shall be at the option of the buyers to deduct any amount shipped to°Russia from the eighteen thousand tons, and in the event should the buyers not desire to deduct such amounts shipped, the seller must provide the total quantity of eighteen thousand tons. . 4. The weight of all oxide delivered under this contract shall be ascertained at the final port of discharge, if there is an official weigher then by such official weigher, but in the event of there being no such official weigher, then by a certuicate as to weight of a single weigher to be mutually agreed upon by the agents for the seller and the buyers, or in the event of their being unable to agree upon a single weigher then by a certificate as to weight of two weighers to be agreed upon between the agents for the seller and the buyers, or by an umpire to be appointed by such weighers in case of difference. The seller and the buyers shall bear in equal shares the actual cost of ascertaining the weight in accordance with this clause. In the event of differences arising through the steamer being detained at Ormuz, all questions arising therefrom shall be submitted for arbitration to two arbitrators at Bunder Abbas, one to be appointed by each party, and if these arbitrators cannot agree they may appoint a third, who shall act as umpire and whose decision shall be final. Any arbitration under this clause shall be held in the presence of the British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas and the local agent of the Persian Government. 5.

Andrew Weir supplementary to, and of equal date witlg the contract between the same parties of the 4th December, 1908. You will see from the enclosed copy* that this instrument virtually releases Muin-ut-Tujjar from any responsibility towards Messrs. A. Weir in the. event of his being prevented by any action of the Persian Government from supplying the oxide stipulated in the main contract of the same date. If valid, then this agreement would appear to relieve 1 Messrs. Strick also from the obligation they have assumed by their contract with the Persian Government to accept any responsibility for violation of the Muin’s agreement with Messrs. A. Weir. ^ I say “ if valid ” because this supplementary agreement is signed only by Messrs. A. Weir but not by either of the other two parties. The agreement, moreover, is not upon stamped paper, and I conclude from these two circumstances that it has no legal validity. Mr. Brown is sending a legalised copy of it to Messrs. Strick. Mr. Brown and Mr. A. 0. Wood, of the Imperial Bank, have both seen the contract of the 4th December, 1908, and assure me that it too has the same defects ; it would thereYire, to all appearances, be as worthless as the supplementary agreement. I hope to be Vble to obtain a copy of the principal agreement,-and if I succeed it will be forwarded to you. It has occurred to me that these two papers may be nothing but copies sent to Muin-ut-Tujjar for his convenience, and that Messrs. A. Weir may have in their possession legally executed agreements; I do not think, however, that this can be the case, as to be valid in England the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s signature (or seal) would have had to be legalised in this consulate-general, but there is no record of any such leo-alisation in the fee book. In these circumstances it seems more than probable that the surmise of Messrs. Strick that there has never been any real contract at all between Messrs. Weir and the Muin is correct, and the whole circumstances of the case appear to me to be so shady that I venture to suggest that before any steps are taken here to safeguard Messrs. Weir’s interests the firm should be called on to produce the original of the contract with the Muin-ut-Tujjar on which they might base their claim against Messrs. Strick and Co. The conduct of this firm throughout this affair seems inexplicable ; they have consistently appeared as the principals in a contract which now seems to have no existence, and further, from the correspondence communicated to your department by Messrs. Strick, it seems almost certain that the real principals are not Messrs. A. Weir but Messrs. Ellinger. What the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s part in the present development may be I cannot pretend to say with any certainty. It seems unlikely that the supplementary agreement could now have been shown to Mr. Brown except with his consent (the supposed original contract was actually shown by the Muin to Mr. Wood and Mr. Brown last December), and in the circumstances it is conceivable that, seeing that his combination with Ellinger \ Government by putting them in possession of evidence showing that so far as Messrs. Wejr are concerned there is no legal claim for compensation. But Muin-ut- Tujjar’s business methods are so tortuous that it would be rash, without strong confirma tory evidence, to build on this conjecture. and Weir has failed, lie desires to gain favour with Messrs. Strick and the Persian I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. [2854 17] * Enclosure printed in 27228.[Thia Document is tbo Fropgrty of His Britannic Majesty’s Go’yGr^TfTPmt.^ j N ' }\^ PERSIA.

Ellmger and Go Gentlemen, Foreign Office, August 19, 1910. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo relative to the question of the shipment of red oxide from Hormuz, enclosing contracts signed by your firm, Muin-ut-Tujjar, and Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. on the 4th December, 1908, on this subject. With reference to the last paragraph of that communication, dealing with the claims put forward by yourselves and Messrs. Weir in connection with this question, Sir E. Grey observes that items 1 and 2 of the latter consist of the gross amount which they reckon that they would have received for certain oxide lying at Avonmouth and Nordenham, in return for the payment of which sum they are prepared to hand over the mineral to the Persian Government. It appears to Sir E. Grey that the basis on which this part of the claim is made out is an incorrect one. Messrs. Weir hold the oxide under an agreement which they consider to be valid, and with which, they contend, the Persian Government had no right to interfere, and he is of opinion that, in these circumstances, they should realise the mineral at once, and claim the difference between the sum so obtained and the amount which would have been theirs if the contract had been allowed to stand and their monopoly had been maintained. Messrs. Weir would, of course, have to furnish proof of the correctness of the calculation by which they fixed the latter sum, and, if the price of oxide has fallen, to show that this is due to the intrusion of another party into the Hormuz trade, and not merely to the ordinary fluctuation of the market. If this method of fixation is adopted, it will of course be impossible to draw up this portion of the claim in its final shape till the 6,583 tons of oxide has been sold and the extent of the firm’s losses established. Sir E. Grey has no observations to offer on the third item of the claim, but, in accepting the figure at which it is put, assumes that its justice can be established by evidence in the event of its becoming necessary to submit the claim to the decision of some tribunal, which, he notes, you have, in your letter under reply, expressed your willingness to do. As regards your own claim, Sir E. Grey perceives that the first of the two items of which it is composed is on account of commission as agents on the undelivered portion of the 18,000 tons of oxide, which form the subject of the contract, at the rate of 5 per cent. Sir E. Grey is unable to find in any of the documents forwarded by you any clause to show that you are entitled to a commission as agents in connection with this business or what the amount of your remuneration was to be. He is accordingly of opinion that, if Muin agreed to pay you such a commission, you must look to him to observe his undertaking, and, in the event of his failure to do so, exhaust your legal remedies before appealing for diplomatic support. It appears to Sir E. Grey that you are equally entitled to sue Muin in respect of this item, whether his title to the concession is good or bad, because the provision at the beginning of the second supplemental agreement does not affect action by you against him. As regards the second item of your claim, Sir E. Grey is unable to find in the documents submitted to him any clause in virtue of which it is included, the 31,000 tons in question being apparently entirely outside the contract on the strength of which the claim is made. I am accordingly to suggest that you should explain in greater detail the grounds on which you consider yourself entitled to the sum in question. I am to add that the contracts enclosed in your letter under reply will be returned to you in due course. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. [2854 3] COPY TO P ' ' ’ . P . o.

I TRIED my utmost to have the contract signed before leaving town, hut to no purpose. The legation is very anxious, too, that it should be signed. With the present Cabinet difficulties, it is quite impossible to make any progress. I hope on my return to town about the beginning of August to have the matter arranged. The Muin-ut-Tujjar is working round to the other side of the fence, and, seeing that it was hopeless for him to combat the Vekil-ul-Roya, he has been trying to get into the good graces of the latter. He informed the Vekil-ul-Roya last week that he held a letter from Weir absolving him from all liability in the event of the Persian Government taking the islands from him. I wired you to this effect on the 13th instant, and added that I hoped to obtain this letter within a week. It now turns out that a supplemental contract was made, copy of which I now enclose, and I am also sending a copy to Mr. Marling. I am trying to borrow the original, and have a copy of it certified by the legation. In the face of this supplemental contract, I do not under stand what right Messrs. Weir and Ellinger had to protest through the Foreign Office against the sale of oxide to you by the Persian Government. I am instructing the bank to wire you that I am sending you the copy of supple mental contract between Weir and Muin-ut-Tujjar, and that I have handed a copv to the legation. I hope that within a few days of this letter reaching you the whole business will be finally concluded. It has been dragging on for a very long time. _ When the new_ Cabinet has been arranged, it will have to be explained all over again to the new Minister of Mines and Public Works, whoever he may be, and there should be no further delay.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th' instant, enclosing a private communication of the same date addressed to Mr. Norman. I am to inform you, in reply, that Sir E. Grey sees no objection to your proposal to communicate the correspondence referred to in your letter to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and to Muin-ut-Tujjar, but that he understands from the last paragraph of that letter that you have already acted on the suggestion so far as the former are concerned. With regard to the statement contained in Foreign Office letter of the 8th July, to which you refer, to the effect that Muin declined to permit Abbas Kuli Khan to take a copy of the firman of 1901 and to the inference which you draw therefrom, that the copy of that document, at present in the possession of His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, was not obtained from Muin, I am to explain that the latter refused to communicate a copy to Abbas Kuli Khan when he showed him the paper in 1907, and that the copy at present in the legation, from which was made the translation in your possession, was obtained from Muin, but only at the end of 1908. I am to express Sir E. Grey’s regret that this point was not made clear in the letter referred to. With reference to the penultimate paragraph of your letter to Mr. Norman, I am to state that your firm, equally with Messrs. Weir, will receive diplomatic support from His Majesty s Government in your endeavours to recover such sums as you may have lost through the breach of the contract signed by you, as Muin’s agents, with Messrs. Weir, so long as these sums represent profits guaranteed to you by the terms of that contract, which, as you are aware, Sir E. Grey has never had the opportunity of perusing. His Majesty’s Government could not, however, undertake to afford that support in respect of any claim which you might put forward without examination of its items^ but would have to satisfy themselves that inclusion of each of these was justified, and the amount claimed not excessive. This condition would, of course, apply equally to&gt; any claim put forward by Messrs. Weir. I am, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY.

You will remember that I explained to you that I was desirous of sending this letter, together with your letter of the 21st May and our letter to you of the 24th June, to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and the Muin, and I understand that I am at liberty to do this. It is stated in the letter of the 8th July that the Muin entirely declined to permit Abbas Kuli Khan to take a copy of the firman of 1904, which he showed to the latter, but the legation have a copy of this firman, and sent us a copy of it, and I presume, in view of the statement contained in your letter, this was not obtained from the Muim Further, in the concluding paragraph of your letter the Foreign Office say that Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. may rest assured of the fullest measure of diplomatic support which His Majesty’s Government can properly afford them.

Andrew Weir and Co. to snrp oxide from the island which you claim on their behalf in virtue of the contract iohq v t y0ur firm ’ actin g as Muin’s representatives, on the 4th December You further request a continuance of the support given you by His Maiestv’s Government up to the time of the declaration of the Persian Government above referred to, and you submit statements showing the amount of the loss incurred by Messrs. Weir and yourselves owing to the breach of the contract in question. .t 18 cJ 1 ear t0 E- Grey that the contentions advanced in your letter are based on a misapprehension of the facts of the case, and he feels sure that when once these are fuffy known to you, you will recognise that the attitude adopted by His Maiestv’s of , y° u aow complain, was forced on them by the circumstances, urged on them ^ absolute ^ r 110 g romi d for taking the steps which you repeatedly r y k e8e which have been familiar to His Majesty’s Government in their main ^Tp 11168 io1 ’ s ° ai . e tlme past through the telegraphic reports of His Majesty’s charge a aires at lehran, have only lately become known to them in detail through a despatch but recently received from him. w i contoined in this despatch was communicated to Mr. Marlino- bv e i -ul-Koaya, the _ deputy for Hamadan, who, in consequence of his high reputation ,? r capacity, and patriotism, was entrusted by the competent committee of e Medjliss with the investigation of Muin-ut-Tujjar’s alleged rights to the concession on which was based the contract of the 4th December, 1908. The facts of the case are as follows :— Moi 'v f ,| V ma . le ,| e r ,p 0r tll 1 e 0xi&lt; l e deposits at Hormuz and elsewhere was granted to Mahk-ut-Tujjar m 1896, and was for a period of ten years. Malik-ut-Tujiar died a year later, and it was then disposed of by his heirs to Muin-ut-Tujjar, who, however only made good his title in 1901 after protracted litigation with Messrs. Malcolm, of Bushire, who had some kind of claim to it. In 1904, rather more than a year before the original concession expired Muin AbhnW “nd firman from the Shah, and this is the document which he showed to AbbasKuh Khan, the Oriental secretary of His Majesty’s Legation, in 1907, as granting the concession m perpetuity. ^ &amp; -uumg Vekil-ul-Roaya however, now explains that this second firman did no more than alter some and confirm others of the provisions of the original firman granted to Malik- ', ' IIJJi '' 111 ’ I' '! 01 extend it, and that the best proof of this view is precisely that no period is fixed for the lease. F ^ Mr. Marling thinks that Vekil-ul-Roaya’s contention is right, for at all events an examination of the document m question (which, like all such Persian instruments is very loosely worded), m the light of subsequent knowledge of an earlier unexpired concession, bears out his reading of it at least as well as that of Muin-ut-Tujjar. ihat Abbas Kuli Khan should have been misled is not surprising. As has been said, t he paper is loosely worded ; he had the greatest difficulty in persuading Muin- Ut-itijjar to allow him even to see it, and the latter entirely declined to permit him to take a copy of it his unwillingness probably arising from the fear that careful stud? of ,t would reveal he flaw and lead to the conjecture of an earlier firman, the production of which he could not avoid, and which would have revealed the fact that the concession had at that time expired. At that moment, when, it must be remembered, Messrs [2824 k 1 ] - - - ^0 INDIAMalcolm, of Busliire, professed their ability to obtain the concession, it was obviously of vital importance to Mum to keep such information from the knowledge of the legation, who were giving him a measure of unofficial support in the hope that lie would carry out his proposal to your firm for the formation of an English company to work the oxide and so debar the trade from falling into German hands, but who, aware that his concession had expired, would of course have had no further interest in him. Vekil-ul-Roaya assured Mr. Marling that the whole question had been thoroughly thrashed out by his committee; that Muin-ut-Tujjar had admitted the facts given above, and although he asserted that he possessed another document which would fully establish his rights he had declined to exhibit it, as he said it contained something which, if it became public, would ruin him. Muin had, indeed, produced what professed to be a copy of the alleged firman, but that paper was obviously worthless, and the inference was that the signatures were forged. Muin had consequently been informed that he had no further rights at Hormuz and the other places mentioned in the firman, since the original concession lapsed in 1906. Mr. Marling adds that this account is in general confirmed by M. Mornard, the Administrator of the Customs, who has had some acquaintance with the question for some time past. At the conclusion of the interview at which Vekil-ul-Roaya gave Mr. Marling this information, the latter told him that he must have more official knowledge of the decision of the committee that Muin’s concession had lapsed in 1906 before he could take cognisance of it, and Vekil then promised that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should address to the legation an official note stating the facts, and that the decision had been arrived at by a legally constituted authority. He asked whether in those circumstances Mr. Marling would consider that the Persian Government would be relieved of responsibility towards Messrs. Weir for the violation of their exclusive contract with Muin-ut-Tujjar by the sale of oxide to Messrs. Strick. Mr. Marling said that, speaking as a layman, he thought that they would be so relieved, except in so far as the Government were responsible for allowing Muin to continue to w r ork oxide after 1906, and so induce Messrs. A. Weir to believe that he still possessed rights. Vekil-ul-Roaya explained this by saying that the original concession had lapsed just at the time when the first great constitutional movement began, and that since then the Government had been in such a state of confusion that Muin had been able by intimidation or bribery to shut the mouths of the comparatively few persons who knew the real facts. (Mr. Marling here observes that, from his own experience of Muin’s methods, he can quite believe that the explanation is a perfectly correct one.) Muin-ut-Tujjar came to the legation on the same day as Vekil-ul-Roaya as well as twice subsequently, but, though he repeatedly asserted that he had documents to prove his rights, he declined to produce them. He was told that the legation had no wish to injure his interests, but was obliged to act in accordance wdth the balance of evidence, which appeared to be against him, but, [if ffie would produce proofs and not mere assertions, due weight would be given to them. This Muin has so far failed to do. A perusal of the above facts will, Sir E. Grey feels sure, convince you that His Majesty’s Government were not and are not in a position to insist that the Persian Government should respect the terms of a contract based on a concession which, from all the evidence available, appears to have lapsed at an earlier date. The utmost that they were justified in doing, and this they have done, was to warn the Persian Government of the responsibility which they would incur for any damage which British interests might sustain by iUegal action on their part, and from the attitude indicated by that warning His Majesty’s Government have not, and have never had, any intention of departing. The present situation may, therefore, be resumed as follows :— There is as yet no absolutely conclusive evidence to show whether the contention of the Persian Government or that of Muin is valid, but the balance of evidence is distinctly in favour of the former, since Muin consistently refuses to produce the documents by which, as he asserts, he could establish his rights, and thus declines to take the step by which, if he is telling the truth, the controversy could at once be ended in his favour. It will be plain to you that, while the validity of Muin’s concession at this moment remains in doubt, Plis Majesty’s Government have no ground for insisting that the Persian Government should respect a contract entirely based on the assumption that that concession was granted in perpetuity. They can, therefore, do no more than demand that British interests should not be injured.In the event, should the Persian Government turn out to he justified in their action, the claim of Messrs. Weir will li^ against Muin, while, if the latter can prove tiis case (in bir E. Grey s opinion a far less probable contingency), they will have a valid cause of complaint against the Persian Government. i either pase,^ they may rest assured of the fullest measure of diplomatic support which His Majesty s Government can properly afford them. v i ew of the turn which events have taken, it is a matter of regret to Sir E Grev that he should have been led to assert his belief in the perpetuity of Muin’s concession even m the qualified manner recorded in Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 18th January 1908’ but it will be conceded that, in the absence of any indication of the existence of a previous firman, there was at that time no reason to doubt its genuine character.

Andrew Weir and Co., and that our rights were then still fully recognised by Hi s&lt;$ Majesty’s Government and regarded as under their protection is clear from the following letter of the 5th May, 1909, written to a member of our firm by Mr. Mallet:— “ In reply to your letter of the 1st instant, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you that a telegram has been sent to His Majesty s Minister at Tehran stating that you are desirous that he should be informed that by their contract with the Muin-ut-Tujiar, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. have acquired the monopoly of the sale of oxide extracted from Hormuz Island, and that British interests would be injured if oxide were removed from island by any party other than Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. or the Muin-ut-Tnjjar.” On the 31st August, 1909, we received a letter from the Foreign Office, whicli intimated that the Muin’s concession appeared to be m imminent danger, and that Sir George Barclay, by instructions of the Secretary of State, was doing all he could on the Mums behalf, and, even if his efforts proved unsuccessful, would endeavour to -protect the rights of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Oo. under their contract with us. ^ Down to this date, therefore, there was no question as to the Mum s concession or as to the legality of his contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Go., or as to the intention of His Majesty’s Government to continue to do, as they had done m the past, all they could to protect the Mnin’s concession ; and so matters stood until the tollowing April when we learnt that a sale of 5,000 tons of oxide from Hormuz had been made by the Persian Government at 45s. a ton, and upon our bringing this to the notice o the Foreign Office we received a reply, dated the 12th April last, to the effect that the report was substantially correct, and that the Persian Government had decided that the Mnin’s concession was invalid, and had declined his application for a renewal. In the same letter it is mentioned that Sir George Barclay had been informed that his Majesty’s Government could not object to the proposed sale of oxide, provided that the legitimate interests of Mr. Weir were not thereby injured, although His Majesty s Government and Sir George Barclay were at that time well aware that by their contract with the Muin-ut-Tujjar, Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. had acquired the monopoly of the sale of the oxide extracted from Hormuz Island and that their interests would he injured if they were removed from the island by any other ■nfirtv ■» We need not allude to the letters that passed between that time and your letter of the 21st Mav, to which we are about to refer, beyond saying the letters received from the Foreign Office during this period between April and May indicate no attempt nor desire on the part of His Majesty’s Government to P revent tn ® violation of our rights, and that, beyond informing the Persian Government that they would he held responsible for onr damages, it was not thought necessary or prac ica t0 d0 Yonr letter of the 21st May now qualifies the obligation of His Majesty’s Govern ment to intervene on behalf of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. against the action o Persian Government in entering into the recent agreement with Mr. Strick by &gt; e v jv important words, “ supposing that the Mnin was within his rights m making contract with that firm.” A ,j. i ^ We venture to suggest that this expression must have been used m torgetrui of the circumstances under which previous assurances of His Majesty s Govemm were given with regard to the concession itself. As we have already shown, assuran as to the concession, founded upon actual inspection of the documents, were g ive -^ ns with the direct object of putting ns in a position to ask onr friends for 111011 W form a company in which English capital would have been embarked ; and it Wi W. _ after onr efforts in the city and the independent efforts there of the late i r.

Andrew Weir and Co., the Mmn-ut-Tujjar, and ourselves. ^ a ^ Q a un( ^ ers f 0 °^ that in this matter His Majesty’s Government had interests independently of the interest His Majesty’s Government always takes in the enterprise ot -British subjects, and we cannot for one moment suppose that the support which was accorded tor that reason will he withdrawn now merely because a British subject has secured a contract with the Persian Government in violation of the rights of Messrs Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, which were known to him, and that consequently tiis Majesty s Government has no longer any interest to serve in giving us the support w ich has been given in the past and was so explicitly and frequently accorded wdien we were endeavouring to make arrangements for keeping the business in British hands, ^or can we suppose that, after having throughout upheld the perpetuity of the concession and given assurances to us upon that footing, His Majesty’s Government wilt new put upon those who have loyally assisted them in the direction of their own wishes the consequences of its being declared by the Persian Government that the concession has expired, without any evidence having been put forward to establish the truth ol this declaration. M ith legald to the actual fact as to whether the concession is in perpetuity or not we, of course, cannot pretend to express an opinion as to the construction that might be placed upon Persian documents in Persia, but regarding the matter from &amp; an 8 r v ^ ew ’ w ® are advised that the terms of the supplemental document of 1JU4, oi which a translation w T as sent to us in your letter of the 29th January 1909 are certainly only capable of being read in the sense of being a perpetual grant, and we would add that neither at the time of forwarding that document nor on the several occasions on which the concession has been in danger of confiscation had its contents apparently given rise to an}^ doubt on the part of His Majesty’s Government or the f ersian Government as to the title of the Muin-ut-Tujjar derived from the concession. e o not understand why the fact that the Persian Government have granted the concession to Mr. Stnck should afford any ground for believing that they are justified m this attitude, as we are informed that Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. have indemnified the Persian Government against any damages they may have to pay for the violation oi other British interests, and that this arrangement is within the knowledge of His Majesty s Legation at Tehran. However that may be, we take our stand upon the assurances given us, upon the faith of which we have acted throughout in promotino- t re^ interests of His Majesty s Government as Avell as the commercial interests of the Mum-ut-1 ujjar, our friends, and ourselves. We submit that, although it is perfectly true to say, as stated in your letter, that the circumstances have changed, there has been no change which m any way affects the right of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves to claim protection from His Majesty’s Government. 1 our lettei ^ takes up further the position that, as the concession is in dispute between two British firms, His Majesty’s Government are bound to exercise absolute impartiality between them. We do not see how at- this stage His Majesty’s Govern ment can be m a position to exercise absolute impartiality between the British subjects W h? se . Berests are involved. His Majesty’s Government, in the year 1908 avowed a decided preference that the oxide _ business should continue in the hands of Messrs. H C. Strick and Co. (Limited), instead of being placed in those of lessis. Andrew Weir and Co., and, m order to meet their wishes, not only did we try to make a contract with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., but the late Mr. Wilson Fox also tried and had several interviews with Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. for this purpose. It was only after we had both failed in our endeavours that the contract was made with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. It was clear in the minds of the lum-ut-Tujjar and ourselves that the transfer of the business might involve the loss . /^Jesty s Government’s support, and we deemed it necessary to ask His Majesty s Government m our letter of the 18th November, 1908, whether we would he quite correct m informing the Muin-ut-Tujjar that, so long as the sale of the oxide remained m our hands, no application to the Persian Government by anv other British subject for the grant of the concession of the island of Hormuz, and consequent confiscation of the concession now held m perpetuity by the Muin-ut-Tujjar, would receive the support of His Majesty’s Government m London or the British Legation m Tehran to which we received an affirmative reply. We also understood at the interviews between Mr. Mallet and Mr. Maxwell and our Mr. M. Ellinger, and aoain at the interviews between Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Norman, and our Mr. M. Ellinger that Messrs. F. G. Strick and Co. had on two occasions been informed that His Majesty’s [2781 bb —3] B 2 '4 Government were not in 3- position to support then cipplicdtion to the Persian Government for the concession. _ . .

Mr. Martin Ellinger, of Ellinger and Co., Manchester, to whom we suggested pooling before we had put any offer in writing, told us (without consulting Weir’s) that no scheme of pooling could be entertained unless on the understanding that we would share with them and (or) Weirs any Ormuz business we or they might secure in the uture. I his we declined to agree to, but we nevertheless formally made the offer to pool by our letter of the 12th May, and repeated it by our letter of the 21st May (b.) This offer was declined on the ground of the amount offered by us beino-’ lower * n? P - nCe by Ellm g er ’ which P ri ce, for reasons given in our letter'’ of the 28th May, is exorbitant. (c.) This offei was apparently not acceptable to Whir’s. They evidently preferred that negotiations should be carried out on the basis of offer (6). There is one point _ to which I should like to take the liberty of drawing your attention, viz., that, during the negotiations, we proposed in our letter to Weir’s of the 12th May, and subsequently repeated the proposal in our letter of the 24th May, that pending negotiations between us, neither we nor they would offer or sell Ormuz oxide' but this suggestion they refused to agree to (see their letter of the 25th May)' doubtless with a view qf forcing us to agree to their terms. The proposals contained in Weir’s letter dated 15th instant—1st, that the price we should pay _ for their stock should be fixed by arbitration, and 2nd, that as an alternative, if we had not already made sales, we should refrain from selling until they had disposed of their stocks 'are, to say the least, most extraordinary, seeing that, by their first proposal, they pre-sappose that we ought to pay them for the whole of their stock the average price which they might have made had they retailed it in the ordinary way, taking about a year to do so; while we, if we agreed to their second proposal, there would be nothing to prevent them holding for such advanced prices that it might take them two or even three years to dispose of their stock. Whilst not admitting that Weir’s have any right whatever to influence our action in any way, it will be seen from the above that we have made every effort possible to save them or their principals from loss in connection with this business, and that if their venture does result in a loss to them, it will be through their declining our offers I am sorry to trouble you with this long letter; still I think it only right that you should know how matters stand.

ACTING upon your suggestion, I called on Messrs F. ^ ^ three interviews with them. It appears they have bought 5 &gt; 000 . by the Persian Government, of which I gather about l,o00 tons are bei § soffie Messrs. Bucknalls’ steamer “ Pondo,” and Messrs. F. C. Stock an • urLnecessar y suggestion from me as to how the sales could be managed so as o j^g the loss, to which I replied that it was obvious some pooling arrangemenwoimi early cmik d for offers if'i FEANICJ iiiGo. solution of the difficulty. Our position is that the Persian Government have arbitrarily declared the Mum’s concession void, and, according to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co.’s statement to me, have sold them 5,000 tons in contravention of the monopoly granted to you by the Muin-ut-Tujjar. The British Government, as explained to you bv the oreign Office, whilst not prepared to prevent the shipment by force, admit that' they are pledged to see that you suffer no loss, and will take such steps as may be required to recover compensation for any loss that you may sustain, and I understand that the r ersian Government will pay your damages for the breach of the contract. The seizure of the Mouin’s concession appears to be an arbitrary and confiscatory proceeding on the part of the Persian Government, and from the information we have, not likely to be maintained^ so that it may be expected that a short time will see the Mum again in possession of his concession. On the other hand, as I have on previous occasions explained, I do not think that Messrs. T. C. Strick and Co. can be permanently shut out of this oxide business, and, as you are aware, it has always been my idea that on the expiration of the present contract, they would have to be admitted, if they so desired, to a share in the business. I was there foie of opinion that if we could come to some pooling arrangement with them now we should be merely anticipating an arrangement which would in any case become desirable in the near future. I found, however, that Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co., whilst possibly inclined to come to an arrangement as to the pooling of the 6,600 tons which you hold here, together with the 5,000 tons, of which they say they have so far only 1,500 tons, were not prepared to admit into such a pool the 5,500 tons we have still to get, nor any future business. As I understand you can get your 5,500 tons still to come forward under your contract if you are prepared to take and pay for them, it appeared to me that this quantity should also form part and parcel of any pooling arrangement, and that no pooling arrangement could work out satisfactorily unless the future business were also included. As 1 pointed out to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. as matters at present stand, even if we pool the 6,600 tons with their 5,000 tons, we should both be face to face with the same difficulty again as at present confronts us if we took our 5,500 tons, or if they bought and shipped a further quantity, or if the Germans or any one else made further purchases. Something of this kind is bound to happen if the Muin’s concession is not upheld, as the Persian Government will not be content during a period of two years to abstain from further sales. I regret to inform you, however, that I quite failed to persuade Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. to adopt my views, and understand that they insist upon confining any arrangement to our quantity of 6,600 tons and 5,000 tons, and intend to compete with us for future business. As I consider such an arrangement quite impracticable, I reluctantly informed them that on these lines further discussion was useless. The arrangement made with them to suspend offers or sales terminated at my last interview, and both parties are now free to act as they please. Unless Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. can put before us a more practicable scheme the loss will run into many thousands of pounds, whereas if an arrangement had been possible the business would have continued a profitable one for all parties. M. ELLINGEB. P.S.—I pointed out to Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. that, in the event of a pool being formed, we should expect the sale of the oxide, to which they would not agree, but they made some suggestion as to the division of territory which they thought might meet the case. I am doubtful of this, but the discussion fell through on other grounds, and this matter was not further mentioned. M. E. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. to Messrs. A. Weir and Co.

As this report refers principally to matters in which we are in no U, way concerned, and also to certain suggestions made by Mr. Ellinger (which we could a 1111 not for reasons explained in our letter of the 12th instant entertain), we need notdeal with it further than to say that you must not take this letter as admitting anything contained in Mr. Ellingers report. . . We are still willing to carry out the offer contained in our letter ot the 12th instant, which we confirm in all its details, but, if this offer does not appeal to you, we are prepared to make you the following alternative proposals, viz. : — 1 Xo buy your stock of Ormuz oxide in the United Kingdom and on the continent at 65s. per ton, free in store up to date of acceptance of this offer. Provisional payment to be made forthwith, but subject to adjustment on final weights as ascertained on delivery ex store ; or 2. To buy said stock at 67s. 6d. delivered free on truck or on board at our option, payment on delivery, we undertaking to take delivery of at least 25 per cent, of the entire quantity each quarter, so that the whole quantity will be delivered and paid for within twelve months, which is the minimum time, as you very well know, within which you could dispose of it.

Dear tfppPT?PTNrp + , . r 6 ’ Avenue, London, May 26, 1910. REFERRING to our letter to you of yesterday’s date, the following is copy of one we have received from Messrs. Elhnger and Oo„ Manchester t y We are in receipt of yours of 23rd instant covering letter from Messrs F C Strick and Co. (Limited) The alternative proposals put forward now by Messrs Strick overcome the insuperable difficulty which we anticipated in confining any poolhj arrangement to your 6,600 tons with their 5,000 tons, and we see no rfason why 3 should not agree on principle to an arrangement on the lines suggested by Messrs Strick subject to what we have to say as to price. The price of 65s. offered by Messrs Strick m their first proposal is quite inadequate. There is no reason to doubt, judging' by the prices we are at present obtaining, that, had the present difficulties imt intervened we would have realised for your 6,623 tons an average price of 73s. 87/. per ton We’ see no reason why you should agree to any arrangement which would pur you in a worse position than that m winch you would have been had the contract run its uninterrupted course, and we therefore suggest for your consideration that you inform Messrs Strick you are prepared to instruct us to hand over to them, in exchange for their cheque^ warrants tor about 6,623 tons of oxide stored at Avonmouth and Nordenham aoMnst payment for same at the rate of 73a. 8d. per ton, free in store, up to date of ac^eptnce !_2781 s—2j r (J6 jwirti TiTftiiTr^ of your offer payment to be made on the weights stated on the warrants, or, if this is not satisfactory to Messrs. Strick, the oxide to be weighed now at their expense. “ We have never found reason to doubt the weights stated m the warrants, and it would be very unsatisfactory to agree to an adjustment on final weights as ascertained on delivery ex store, as this settlement might be deferred for years, as it pays much better to deliver ex ship from new cargoes than to take the oxide out of store. “ The price we have advised is not higher than would have been realised under a pooling arrangement had that been found practicable. 11 you can get Messrs. Strick to purchase your stock of oxide on these conditions, we recommeod you to do so. We cannot recommend you to entertain Messrs. Strick’s second proposal.” We would add we are quite disposed to adopt what Messrs. Ellinger recommend. Yours faithfully, ANDREW WEIR and Co. Enclosure 10 in No. 1. Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. to Messrs. A. Weir and Co. Baltic House, Leadenhall Street, London, Dear Sirs, May 28, 1910. WE’are in receipt of your letter of yesterday, giving us copy of letter addressed to vou by Messrs. Ellinger and Co. W 7 e have been under the impression that the oxide in question belonged to you, and are surprised that Messrs. Ellinger appear to control the business. We altogether disagree with Messrs. Ellingers statement, that, in the absence of competition, the oxide would realise on an average 73s. 3d. per ton. We are certain that no such average net price could be realised, and we have a quarter of a-centurys experience of the article; besides, we know what Messrs. Ellinger have been asking ^ or it* i • j In any case, that is quite beside the question. You and (or) Messrs. Ellmger and we will have considerable stocks, and our desire has been along, and still is, to try and do away with any needless competition, which would only mean a loss to all concerned. We know perfectly well that the price we have offered you leaves a better net price than you could possibly realise without any competition whatever, and we are not disposed to increase it. We might point out en passant that in another direction Messrs. Ellinger have not quite given the matter mature consideration, as a reference to our letter will show that an acceptance of our alternative offer would have involved settlement within twelve months, and we should have no objection to modify the first proposal by stating that if we have not taken the oxide out of either store in twelve months, we will either settle on the warrant weights or have the balance in store weighed at our expense. In view of the prohibitive value Messrs. Ellinger and Co. place on the oxi le, it appears to us that there is no chance of any understanding being arrived at, and consequently we much regret that there seems no other course left to us but to withdraw from further negotiations, unless we hear from you on Monday that you are prepared to modify your views.

Tehran, May 14, 1910. •i ^ j SU ^i emen ^ m ^ orma Oon contained in my telegram No. 184 of the 21st April and subsequent messages on the subject of the Hormuz oxide trade I have the honour to submit a short r&amp;umb of the history of the concession, as recounted to me and to Mr. David Brown, Messrs. Strick’s agent, by the Vekil-ul-Roaya, the deputy for Hamadan, who m consequence of his high reputation for integrity, capacity and patriotism, has been entrusted by the competent Committee of the Mediliss with the investigation of the Mum-ut-Tujjar’s alleged right sand the negotiation of the contract with Messrs, btnck. Vekil-ul- Roaya has also conducted the negotiations for the consolidation and payment of the loans and advances made by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Hoy eminent, and both Mr. Rogers and Mr. Brown believe him to he honest and disinterested. A/i ri ^f rp r ^ na ? d e P os i ts at Hormuz and elsewhere was granted to Malik-ut-Tujjar in 1312 (1896), and was for a period of ten years. Malik-ut-TuRar died a year later, and it was then disposed of by his heirs to Muin-ut-Tujjar, who, however, only made good his title in 1317 (1901) after protracted litigation with Messrs. Malcolm 5 of Buslnre, who had some kind of claim to it. ’ iv/r • (^04), rather more than a year before the original concession expired Mum obtained a second firman from the Shah, and this is the document which he showed to Abbas Kuh Khan in 1907 as granting the concession in perpetuity Ihe Vekil-ul-Roaya, however, now explains that this second firman did no more than alter some and confirm others of the provisions of the original firman granted to Malik-ut-Tujjar m 1896, but did not extend it, and that the best proof of this view is precisely that no period is fixed for the lease. I venture to think that Vekil-ul-Roaya’s contention is right; for at all events an examination of the document m question (which like all such Persian instruments is very loosely worded) m the light of our subsequent knowledge of an earlier unexpired concession, bears out his reading of it at least as well as that of Muin-ut-Tuj jar. •a lA bbas Jvuii Khan should have been misled is not surprising. As just now said, the paper is loosely worded; he had the greatest difficulty in persuading the Mum-ut-lujjar to allow hmyeyen to see it, and the latter entirely declined to allow him to take a copy of it, his unwillingness probably arising from the fear that careful study ot it would reveal the flaw and lead to the conjecture of an earlier firman the production of which he could not avoid and which would have revealed the fact that the concession had at that time expired. At that moment, when, as you may recall, Messrs. Malcolm of Bushire professed their ability to obtain the concession, it was 0 bviously of vital importance to the Muin to keep such information from the knowledge 01 the legation, who were giving him a measure of unofficial support in the hope that he would carry out his proposal to Messrs. Ellinger to form an English company for the working of the oxide, and so debar the trade from falling into German hands but who, if aware that his concession had expired, would of course have no further interest m him, but would devote their efforts to secure the business for Messrs. Malcolm and otrick. I nave ventured to digress thus far as it seemed necessary to offer some explanation of the circumstances of 1907. 3 e Vekil-ul-Roaya assured me that the whole question had been thoroughly thrashed out by his committee that the Muin-ut-Tujjar had admitted the facts given above and although he asserted that he possessed another document which would fully establish his rights, he had dec med to exhibit it, as he said it contained something which if it became public would rum him. The Muin had, indeed, produced what professed to be a copy of the alleged ffrman, but such a paper was obviously worthless, and the inference was that the signatures were forged. The Muin had consequently been informed that he had no further rights at Hormuz and the other places mentioned in the firmans, since the original concession lapsed in 1906 [2781 f—15] COPY TO. INDIA 91 *?. j S E C H b T A R Y’S N V.zCI may add that the above account was in general confirmed by M. Mornard, the administrator of the customs, who has had some acquaintance with the question for At the conclusion of the interview on the 22nd April, at which A ekil-ul-Roaya gave me this information, I told him that I must have more official knowledge of the. decision of the committee that Muin’s concession had lapsed m 1906 before I could taki) coo-nizance of it, and he then promised that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should address to the legation an official note stating the facts, and that the decision had been arrived at by a legally constituted authority. He asked whether in those circumstances I should consider that the Persian Government would be relieved of responsibility towards Messrs. Weir for the violation of their exclusive contract with the Muin-ut-Tujjar by the sale of oxide to Messrs. Strick. I said that, speaking as a layman, I thought that they would be so relieved, except in so far as the Government were responsible for allowing theMuin to continue to work oxide after 1906, and so induce^ Messrs. A. Weir to believe that he still possessed rights. The Vekil-ul-Roaya explained this hy saying that the original concession had lapsed just at the time when the first great constitutional movement began, and that since then the Government had been in such a state of confusion that the Muin had been able by intimidation or bribery to shut the mouths of the comparatively few persons who knew the real facts. From my own experience of the Muin’s methods I can quite believe that the explanation is a perfectly correct one. To the other argument of the Vekil-ul-Roaya, that the 1904 firman was obtained hy bribery, 1 attach very little importance, as in those days every concession involved the payment of heavy sums to influential Ministers and courtiers, and even to the Shall himself. tt -i -i i -n „ Muin-ut-Tujjar came to the legation on the same day as Vekil-ul-Koaya, as well as twice subsequently, but though he repeatedly asserted that he had documents to prove his rights he declined to produce them. He was told that the legation had no wish to injure his interests, but having to reconcile conflicting British interests, it was obliged to act in accordance with the balance of evidence, which appeared to^ be against him; but if he would produce proofs, and not mere assertions, we should give due weight to them. _ •xil'iW 1 It was with this information before me that when I received your telegram ho. 109 of the 22nd April, I felt some hesitation about renewing the protest against the action of the Persian Government on the steam-ship Pondo ” in violation of Messrs. A. Weirs contract with the Muin-ut-Tujjar, as I feared that to do so might prevent them from proceeding with the negotiations with Messrs. Strick, which at that moment seemed to be approaching conclusion. It appeared to me that in the uncertainty in which we were as to the real facts, it was better if possible to engage the Persian Government in a contract with Messrs. Strick lasting five years, than to endeavour to make safe Messrs. Weir’s interests, which will expire in a much shorter period, he., on the 1st April, 19L, while there was the further consideration that in any case these latter were already safeguarded by Sir G. Barclay’s note of the 16th April. Taking all these circumstances into consideration, the best solution appeared to be that Messrs. Strick should obtain the contract with the Persian Government, and simultaneously, if possible, come to some friendly understanding with Messrs. A. Weir. Mr. Brown concurred in this view and laid it before his principals, but at first there seemed to be little prospect of our suggestion being accepted, first because Mr. btric seemed ‘unwilling, for some reason of which I am ignorant, to approach Messrs, eir, and secondly because the Persian Government required the insertion in the propose contract with Messrs. Strick, by which the latter agreed to relieve them of any claim advanced against them by Messrs. Weir for violation of his contract with the Mum, a condition which Mr. Strick declined to accept. It appeared to Mr. Brown and myse , however, that if the Vekil-ul-Roaya’s account of the Muin’s position was correct, Messrs. Weir’s remedy would lie not against the Persian Government, but against Muin-ut-Tujjar, and that therefore the condition demanded by the Persian Governmen, but refused by Mr. Strick, was useless, and Mr. Brown consequently endeavoure induce the Persian Government to adopt this view. n n If of The Persian Government, however, on whom the second protest^ on bena ^ Messrs. Weir, made by mysell on receipt of your telegram No. 3 of the 25th April, made an unfortunate impression, declined to withdraw the condition, lo overc ^ Messrs. Strick’s reluctance to accept it, the only feasible step seemed to be to ur g ^ Persian Government to send in the note suggested by the Vekil-ul-Roaya. 'j; G p 1 - aI1 that if Messrs. Strick, on the faith of that note, concluded the contract with the ® r g S grg Government including a clause relieving them of their responsibility towardsWei i r i, ^ nd the ® tatement was afterwards proved to be false, the clause above mentioned would become ipso facto null. Mr. Brown therefore urged this view on Mr Strict and simultaneously pressed the Vekil-ul-Roaya to cause the promised note to be sent to me a nl TeS n d - ffic ! dty tilen ar ? se * 111 t0 Sir G - Barclay’s protest of the 12th Persian Government had stated that “ Muin-ut-Tuj jar’s arrangement with the British firm will be respected,” and feeling that the promise made in this note precluded them from making any contract with Mr. Strick, they now desired that the note should be returned. When, however, they learned that the surrender of the note was impossible (and in any case useless, as a copy would be preserved in the legation) they cast about for another way out of this dilemma, and finally, as I reported in my telegram No. 221 of the 9th May, suggested to Mr. Brown that Mr. Strick should be asked to submit the terms on which he would undertake the responsibility for Messrs A. weirs claim against the Government or against Muin-ut-Tuj jar. Meantime Messrs. A. Weir appear to have approached Messrs. Strick through Messrs Ellin o- e r (your telegram of the 28th April) for the reconciliation of their conflicting interests— though on what lines I am still unaware—for on the 11th instant Mr. Brown informed me that he had signed a contract with the Persian Government on the following terms:— s The Persian Government sell to Messrs. Strick 30,000 tons of oxide at 405. per ton free on board, to be taken up 6,000 tons each year for five years from date. _ The Persian Government bind themselves to self exclusively to Messrs. Strick during the term of the contract. The present contract cancels the previous contract for 5,000 tons at 45s. 1 rtnA additi01110 tde a k° ve 30,000 tons, the Persian Government give Messrs. Strick 1,000 tons tree on board, and in return Messrs. Strick accept full responsibility for anv claim which Messrs. A. Weir may have against the Persian Government or against Mum-ut-lujjar on account of their contract with the Muin. The 30,000 tons are to be paid for as follows : 10s. per ton, or 15,000/., to be paid at once, and the balance 30s. per ton on delivery. . ^ venture to think that the signature of this contract is on the whole satisfactory as it secures the exclusive trade in Hormuz oxide in British hands, and this if my surmise that some arrangement has been reached between Messrs. Strick and Messrs. Weir is correct, without leaving outstanding a claim against either the Persian Government or Mum-ut-Tujjar, which it would undoubtedly have proved a lono- and tedl ous matter to recover^ On the other hand it is not, of course, so satisfactory as would have been the acquisition of a lease of the island of Hormuz, which would have carried with it the right to work the other minerals which exist there.

Ellinger and Co., of Manchester, we beg to advise you that since then we have had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Martin Ellinger on two or three occasions, and that, at our last interview with him on the 5th instant, we told him that we should be pleased to entei into a pooling arrangement as regards your and our stocks, i.e., to pool your stock of oxide in Germany and in England, which we understood from Mr. Ellinger amounted altogether to about 6,600 tons, with 5,000 tons of ours, part of which has been shipped, part of which is in course of shipment, and balance is to follow. Mr. Ellinger, however, stated that no such arrangement would be entertained by you unless it was’agreed that all future business connected with Hormuz should be worked for your and our joint account. In other words, that you and we should be considered as jointly and equally interested in all future Hormuz business, whether same were secured by your good selves or by us. We explained to Mr. Ellinger that such an arrangement would not suit us, where upon Mr. Ellinger stated that it was useless discussing matteis further. Now in order that there may be no misunderstanding between us, we beg to repeat that we are quite ready to pool your 6,600 tons with 5,000 tons of ours, on any reasonable terms which we have no doubt can be easily arranged between us, thereby enabling us both to make a profit instead of a loss, which would necessarily result from competition between us. , We should be glad if you would give our proposal your early consideration and let us have your views early next week, as we are being pressed for offers of oxide, but naturally in the meantime will not move in the matter.

Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves in connection with the Hormuz business. Whilst frankly acknowledging that His Majesty’s Government have taken measures to warn the Persian Government that compensation would have to be paid for the violation of the rights of British subjects consequent on the cancellation of the Moin-ut-Tujjar’s concession, I was of opinion, after my interview of the 20th instant with Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Norman, that I had failed in my endeavour to induce His Majesty’s Government to take action of any kind which would lead to the prevention of those acts which violated the interests of Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. and ourselves, and especially the prevention of the loading of the oxide per steam-ship “ Pondo.” I am relieved to see from your favour under reply that, upon receipt of my letter of the 21st instant, Sir Edward Grey telegraphed to His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Tehran, instructing him to point out to the Persian Government that the proposed shipment of oxide on board steam-ship “ Pondo ” constitutes a violation of the rights enjoyed by Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. under their contract with the Moin-ut-Tuj jar, and to inform them that His Majesty’s Government must hold them responsible for the injury to British interests caused by their action, but I am disappointed that Sir Edward Grey has not thought it advisable to instruct His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Tehran to take all steps that he possibly can to procure the postponement and ultimate prevention of the proposed loading per steam-ship “ Pondo.” It appears to me, and this is what I desired to point out by my letter of the 21st instant, that His Majesty’s Government, whilst taking all possible steps to warn the Persian Government that damages would have to be paid for the violation of the rights of the concerned, does not appear, as far as I can judge from my interviews and from the correspondence, to have taken any action to prevent the violation of these rights.

Of course, if we continue to oppose their negotiation, they will be compelled to obtain assistance abroad. Before replying to their request we must have satisfactory information as to the composition of the British group. At present our knowledge of the syndicate is slight, except for reports from Sir' G.

I suggest that, if we receive satisfactory information as to the syndicate, we should reply that, so long as none of the customs and other revenues which are pledged to the service of Russian and British loans are hypothecated thereby, the syndicate are at liberty to conclude loans.

He had received a letter from Haji Ah Akbar and Sons (Limited), but says he refuses to enter into any negotiations through them. He states that they made an offer of 40,000Z. cash and one-quarter of ^ P r . ofits y ear ly lor fifty years. He accepts the quarter of the profits, but asks for 200,000/. in cash. I pointed out that the sum he mentioned was an absurd one, but he would not be persuaded to reduce it. The concession would only apply to red oxide on the islands and salt and sulphur on the littoral. As salt for consumption in the country is at present a monopoly of the Persian Government under a new salt tax which is about to be levied, only salt for export would be included in the concession. i ^ ^ ^al 3 neither he nor the Persian Government had any precise know- edge of the value of the concession, nor did they know anything about the amount of salt and sulphur exported. He stated that the amount of oxide shipped was 6,000 tons yearly. I recommended that the Government should send some one to report on the • the P^P° 1 sed con cession, but he did not agree to this. Apparently, the difficulty of finding a reliable person for the work stood in the way. v ^ or ^ permis de recherche. He saw no objection to this being granted but he had no authority to act with regard to it, but promised he would obtain it if possible, within twelve days. I think it probable that the permis de recherche may be forthcoming, but so far as the concession is concerned, I am afriad we will have to wait until they form a more accurate estimate of the value of the rights they propose to dispose of. The Persian _ Government is not by any means so hard pressed for cash as many people seem to think. Their position is much easier than it was a year ago, and is daily improving , at the same time, there can be no doubt that a large amount of ready money is still urgently required to put things in proper order.

Strict s agent already knows that I am aware of the existence of Weir’s contract. It was necessary to tell him about it in order to explain my attitude towards Moin’s concession. ^ Agent would have known of it in any case, as Moin showed copy to the bank some time ago, besides w'hich it must have been known locally when we intervened on nationalists stopping mining work in Hormuz. My reason for thinking that Moin must have drawn on E l li nger in anticipation of Weir s instalments is that Moin, who wished to pledge instalments to the Imperial Bank of Persia, stated that only those after April were available. I doubt whether, when Stride undertook to continue W^eir s contract, he intended W r eir to continue pay ments to Ellinger for oxide which, if Strick got concession, would belong to him (Strick)., I have not seen undertaking, but I expect that Strick contemplates receiving Weir’s payments himself, and you will have noticed from Strick’s telegrams to his agent that he is anxious to get included in his concession all the oxide already mined. If Ellinger has accepted Moin s bills in advance, I still fear that former may be a sufferer if latter’s concession is cancelled. .

YV gir and Ellinger have, however, assured us that it does exist, and, as a matter of fact, Strick is also aware of it, but you should not appear to know of it in conversation with Strick’s agent. Ellinger signed it as Moin’s agent. We have not heard of acceptance by Ellinger of bill drawn by Moin, but, if Weir s contract is maintained by Strick, and Weir, in consequence, receives his instalments, would not he be bound by his contract with Ellinger to pay the latter so that Ellinger would not only depend on the Moin ?

It is possible that the new Government may cancel Moin’s Hormuz concession, in which case Strict, I understand, would be anxious to acquire it. I know how desirous you are to assist Strict, but the Moin, being under contract to Weir, would be sure to invote our protection. Provided that Weir’s interests were safeguarded— i.e., new concessionnaire toot over Moin’s obligations to them—I take it we should not be bound to oppose cancellation of his concession, but in view of harm Moin’s hostility to our interests in the south might do to us, I should hesitate to incur it by refusing him our support. Were Strict certain to obtain the concession it might be worth running the risk, but the future concessionnaire would have to pay through the nose, and if Strict realises that in any case we must insist on fulfilment of Weir’s contract, which covers, I believe, world’s demand for three years, he might not be keen on it. I admit Moin is passively obstructive to us as it is, but his active opposition e.g., going over to the Germans, is a contingency which should give us pause. I have no certain knowledge that they will cancel concession, but I feel that matter may come up at any moment, and I should wish to be in a position to act quickly either for Strict or Moin.[This Dogament is the Property of His ' mnntnm ' -■•-'Tr^--n--Miiiif !

EUinqer and Co. to Foreign Office.—(Received June 14.) Sir, 28, Oxford Street, Manchester, June 12, 1909. WE beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of theikth May. We have now beard further from the Mouin upon the subject of the oxide. The Moumtujai writes us m reply to certain propositions that we have made to him for the exploration of the sulphur mines, that these propositions have had his attention, but the present state of affairs has changed all his ideas. He attached a great importance to a contract concluded with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., which he considered would secure his peace of mind, whilst he states on the contrary he finds this has only embarrassed him and tied him hand and foot. He stated that some days previous to the 15th May he was advised by the legation that the British Minister had been informed by the consul at Bunder Abbas that the latter had arranged with the Nationalists not to interfere in the oxide business, and that the value of any oxide which might be shipped would be deposited at the consulate until the conditions existing between the Government and the people had ceased. He stated that for many reasons he could not accept this proposal, and that he had informed the Minister at Tehran of this. He maintains that these propositions are quite contrary to what he expected after the written and verbal promises which he had received assuring him that if he could conclude a contract he would receive every protection. According to his view, even if the Nationalists carried away the whole of the stock of oxide at Ormuz, the reflection upon his honour would not be as great as that caused by the sequestration of the money in the consulate. He further states that it is evident that he will himself have to do all that is necessary to protect his position, that this will cost considerable money, and that in consequence of these extra expenses, he is of opinion that he will be forced to cancel the contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., so that he may shortly ship a considerable quantity of oxide which is in stock at Ormuz, as the continuation of this stock at Ormuz places him in a very dangerous position. He acknowledges receipt of our letter, in which we assured him that His Majesty’s Government will fully protect the stock of oxide at Ormuz, so as to maintain him in a position to carry out his contract with Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. He, however, points out to us that we should obtain full assurances so that he does not cancel his contract. He asks for protection of the stock of oxide and for his people during the mining operations, and the loading of the steamers; that the price of the oxide shall be paid to us and no other party, according to the contract. Also protection against the intervention of any third party either of the Government or the people, in the mining operations, so that the monopoly which he assured to Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. under this contract can be maintained. He states that although the revolutionaries have evacuated Ormuz after having been defeated, he cannot feel completely reassured until he has obtained the assurances on the three above-mentioned points, and that the Government will not be allowed to transfer his concession to another. We had hoped that you would by this time have received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran details of the arrangement which has been made. Our Mr. M. Ellinger will be in town early next week, and we shall be glad if you will kindly let us know by return of post whether it will be convenient to see him at 3 o’clock on Tuesday the 15th, afternoon.

WI1H reference to our separate letter of date, we think it may interest you to have knowledge of some of the remarks which the Mouintujar makes in his letters to hand this mail regarding the present position in Tehran and Ormuz. He acknowledges our letter of the 6th April, in which we advised him that His Majesty^ Government will protect the oxide, and that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran will take any steps that may be necessary. He regrets, however, that he is advised from Bunder Abbas that the British Consul there has not taken sufficient measures, and, further, that although he asked the Legation three days earlier if they had received news from Bunder Abbas, he was only told that a telegram had been received from Bunder Abbas, and that the contents had been communicated to London whence a reply was awaited. He states that he has not been informed of the contents of the telegram in question, but he thinks that the Consul has asked what attitude he should take up, and how he should act. He supposes that the British Minister will have probably asked instructions from you, because he understands that m pursuance of a Convention which exists between His Majesty’s Government and that of Russia, His Majesty’s Government does not desire to interfere in Persia. He states that had he not been assured at the commencement of the necessary protection, he would perhaps himself have taken other measures to safeguard his rights ; whilst relying upon our previous assurances, he had instructed his people not to take any action, and that the Consul would do whatever might be necessary. He writes that he would have tele graphed us that the carabineers had been placed on the island, and that they were preventing his men from working in the mines and mining the oxide, but he thought we would have been informed of this fact by your good self, and that the Convention mentioned formed an insuperable obstacle to any steps we might desire to take. He. himself seems to think that it is a good opportunity for His Majesty’s Gevernment to intervene for the protection of the oxide at Ormuz, and that this would have good results in future. He goes on to say that he will await the result of the steps taken by the Legation and the Consul at Bunder Abbas, and that if he is disappointed he will then take other steps, and will also know that these contracts serve no other purpose than to tie his hands. He is very disappointed that, in spite of the assurance given to him by the Minister at Tehran and by us at different times, if he made a contract with an Bnglish firm the oxide would be effectually protected, these hindrances have been allowed to continue at Ormuz without any steps having been taken by the Consul to put an end to them. _ With reference to the above, we beg to point out that you did inform us that the mining operations were being interfered with, but we did not ask you at the time to take any steps to stop this interference, relying upon your assurances that this would be done when it became necessary. It appears to us that the time has now come when His Majesty’s Government should take the necessary steps to see that the business can be carried on unmolested, in view of the fact that the Mouin has now notified us that he is restrained by the presence of the carabineers on the island from continuing his mining operations, and cannot for this reason carry out his contract, and that consequently we may within the next few months find ourselves face to face with the fact that Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. wish to ship from Ormuz a full cargo, which cannot be supplied. We are, &amp;c.

We cannot at present state the quantity that we shall ship, as this will depend upon the position of the freight market; but we may mention that the last cargo we brought home by the steamer Auchendale was over 6,000 tons, and it is highly desirable that the Mouintuiiar should now be aUowed to continue his mining operations unmolested, so that he can mme a sufficient quantity of oxide to provide a full cargo for a steamer should it be ne^ed.

I am to inform you that, as a result of the interview which you had at this Office on the 26th instant with Mr. Norman, Sir E. Grey addressed a telegram to Sir G. Barclay stating that, as the rapidity with which it would pay Messrs.

Grey added that you were unable to understand his reason for asking the question. Sir E. Grey has now received a further telegram from Sir G. Barclay, in reply to his communication, stating that his inquiry was prompted by the fear that the reported stoppage of mining operations might be injurious to the interests of Messrs.

Yours faithfully, (Signed) M. ELLINGER. [2012 t —4]CONFIDENTIAL. Memoranda communicated by Mr. Wilson Fox {Board of Trade), November 7, 1908. I SAW Mr. Strict on Friday, the 30th October, for a few minutes. I told him that I was expecting Mr. Ellinger to call on me early in the following week, and that I should be glad to know what his (Mr. Strick’s) views were as to the formation of a Company for the acquisition of iron oxide on Ormuz. Mr. Strict gave me to understand that heNvas hot favourable to joining a Company, though he did not actually say that he would not. I then said that I thought, if it were found possible to get up a Company, that he might well consider whether he could not come to terms with Mr. Ellinger on the lines of the negotiations in July and August last, namely, that Mr. Strick should buy, at 42s. 6d. a-ton, 20,000 tons, over a period of two and a-half years. I told him that this might be his last chance of acquiring the Ormuz oxide, and I expressed the hope that he would consider the matter very carefully. I asked him to think over the terms on which he would buy the Ormuz oxide, so that he would be prepared to^discuss the matter on a practical basis with Mr. Ellinger. I added that, if he refused the Ormuz oxide now, there was some danger of the business going to Germany, and that he might never get a similar chance again. I ended the conveisation by suggesting that I should ask Mr. Ellinger to call on Mr. Strick in order that they might discuss the whole, and Mr. Strick agreed to see Mr. Ellinger for this purpose if he called. October 31, 1908. (Signed) A ’ WILS0N F ° X - Mr. Ellinger called upon me to-day (the 2nd November) at the Board of Trade I informed him that during his absence abroad I had seen Mr. Strick on two occasions and that he did not seem very anxious to take part in a Company in connection with the acquisition of the iron oxide in Ormuz. At the same time, I added that Mr. Strick had never said that he would not join a Company. I said that I thought that Mr. Strick would probably piefei to make a contract himself with the Mouin, if suitable terms were offered him. I reminded Mr. Ellinger that Mr. Strick had been willing to give the Mouin the price he asked for the oxide, namely, 42s. 6c?. a ton, but that he could not agree to some ot the other stipulations, and what he specially objected to was the absence of any guarantee as to the quality of the oxide. I told Mr. Ellinger that Mr. Strick was the obvious person to come to terms with if he could. In the first place, Mr. Strick owns ships, and therefore, as he would get profit from the freight as well as from the sale of oxide, he would be in a better position to offer favouraole terms than any one else; secondly, he was an expert in dealing with oxide and knew where to get a market; thirdly, Mr. Strick was a dangerous opponent to have against him, and as every one always consulted him in all matters relating to oxide, he could probably prevent the formation of a Company, or possibly ruin one if established. Mr. Ellinger agreed with me that it would be better for him to make terms with Mr. Strick if possible, and he also appeared to agree with the view that Mr. Strick could probably stop a Company being formed if he chose to do so. He wanted to know how far I could help him in the City by bringing the scheme to the notice of some financiers. I replied— 1. That at present there was no practical scheme to put before any one, and that if Mr. Ellinger wanted to raise any money, he must get something definite on paper; something which City men would really consider seriously : some information from an expert point of view as to the amount of oxide on Ormuz, the quality, and the prospect of 120,000 tons of oxide of this quality being obtainable during the next twenty years; also, the cost of getting the oxide to England, the probable selling price per ton, the V012 v-l] L x ^ •profit to be made, &amp;c.; also, if possible, to give the names of some supporters of the scheme. d document drawn up by Mr. Bllinger to any financiers in the City they would have to consider it entirely on its merits from a business point of view; that' I was not a Company promoter, neither could the Board of Trade take up such a nosition • also if Mr. Strict did not join the Company I should fee bound to point his out! because by not so doing I should be concealing a very material fact, as the hostihty of Mr. Strict to a Company would be a real danger. ’ I asked Mr. Ellinger how much capital he could raise in Manchester, and to my' , surprise he replied that he did not think that he could raise any. I was under the impression that when he was. suggesting forming a Company earlier in the year he had some Manchester backing. It is pretty clear that he knows no one of any financial standing in the City of London, and that his hopes of raismg money res ed on he prospect of obtaining assurances from the Government and using thein as a pr f the security of the investment. He also had got it into his mind that the Government would never let the business go to Germany. I told him that I doubted it the Germans were such reckless people as to buy oxide at a fancy figure for a long teim o ytais and also run the risk of having the business ruined by Stncks competition, for assui edly if Strick let Ormuz go it would be because he thought that he could successfully compete in the near future by some means or other. ^ , T , I then took Mr. Ellinger over the terms of the Mourns offer and I think I convinced him that they were untenable—that no business man would look at them. Mr. Ellinger said that he was very anxious to discuss what terms would be acceptable in the City. I told him that under the Mouin’s present terms he must bear m mind that the possible profit to the investor was only 10 per cent.—nothing like a sufficient inducement, having regard to the risks to be run under the JVIouin s terms; that the capital asked for to start with was far too large ; that the quality of the oxide must he guaranteed; and that the Mouin would have to suggest better terms in other ^ I added that if a Company cannot be got up the next best thing to do was for him to try to get Mr. Strick to make the arrangement discussed in July and August, namely, that Mr. Strick should buy 20,000 tons over a period of two and a-half years at 425 I also indicated that possibly he might join hands with Mr. Strick and sell the oxide, giving the Mouin a share of the profits or a royalty, Mr. Strick also having the freight. . „ He also raised the question of “ assurances” to the Mouin. I said that, so tar as the assurances given by the Foreign Office in regard to the Company suggested in t e spring of this year, I had no reason to suppose that they would not apply to any Company promoted now, though I could give no definite statement on that point; that, so far as assurances to secure the personal safety of the Mouin and his sons went, I could say nothing, that being entirely a matter outside my knowledge and province. I however expressed the opinion that 1 thought that it would be time enougi to raise the question of assurances when Mr. Ellinger was more certain whether it would be possible to get up a Company at all. Mr. Ellinger subsequently left to call on Mr. Strick in the City, and is to see me again at noon to-morrow (Tuesday). ° V (Signed) A. WILSON EOX. November 2, 1908. Mr. Ellinger called upon me at the Board of Trade on Tuesday, the 3rd November. He had previously called on Mr. Strick, who appears to have told him that he was not disposed to go into Mr. Ellinger’s proposed Company. Mr. Ellinger told me that one o the reasons given was that it was lor too long a period (twenty years). But this is by no means the main reason. Mr. Strick thinks that the terms offered are generally much too onerous—a “wild-cat” scheme, as he described it to me on the telephone—- and further, the inducements offered to Mr. Strick to participate are not good enoug for him. k o-nt Mr. Ellinger agreed with me that he did not think that a Company could be g up if Mr. Strick did not participate, but he threw out the suggestion that His Majesty s Government might find some money. I told him to dismiss this idea from Ins nnn , and that if he wanted to get British money for this enterprise it must he on a businessbasis. I reminded him that the Foreign Office had shown considerable interest in the matter, and had, earlier in the year, given certain assurances, and that this would ,certainly be of value if the proposal made by the Mouin was one that could be enter tained by British investors. I then told Mr. Ellinger that if the formation of a Company was impossible, he had better concentrate on making an agreement with Mr. Strick. He said that he had discussed this with Mr. Strick, and that he did not think that an agreement was impossible. He thought that Mr. Strick might take between 20,000 and 30,000 tons &lt;)f oxide at 425. Qd, a-ton if the other terms were suitable. He asked me what induce ment there was for the Mouin to make a contract with Mr. Strick instead of selling, as he was at present, to the highest bidders. I replied that, in the first place, the Mouin would know exactly what his revenue would be from the oxide for two and a-half or three years; and secondly, I thought that the Shah would find it very difficult to seize the Mouin’s property if there was a bond fide contract existing between him and a British subject. Mr. Ellinger seemed anxious that the Foreign Office and India Office should know that difficulties had arisen in connection with the formation of the Company, and he a' ned that he thought they might be able to find some money to put into the Company. I again said that I thought they would not do so, but as he expressed the wish to see Sir Bichmond Bitchie, 1 went over to the India Office with him and saw Sir R. Ritchie. At the India Office I informed Sir R. Ritchie that Mr. Strick was indisposed to go into a Company; that the terms offered by the Mouin were not considered good enough by business men, and, generally, that it was very improbable whether a .Company could be got up without Mr. Strick’s co-operation. But I added that there was still some hope that Mr. Ellinger and Mr. Strick might come to terms upon the basis of the negotiations which took place between them in July and August last. Mi. Ellinger then laised the point about Covernment monetary assistance towards the formation of a Company, and we held out no hope of this. I said that the British commercial interests abroad were so vast that if the Government took to putting money into enterprises which business men would not take up on a commercial basis, there would be no end to the demands for such action on their part. I added that ’if the Government adopted such a policy they would, moreover, have to appoint agents or nominate representatives as Directors of Companies to see that the business was being managed properly and their money expended in the right way. . Mr - Ellinger said that he thought that the Government might help, as they are anxious to get up the Company. But Sir R. Ritchie reminded Mr. Ellinger that the proposal came from him to the Foreign Office early this year; that it was he who suggested the Company and asked for assurances, and that it was when the negotiations with Mr. Ellinger and Mr. Strick broke down in the summer that a further consideration of the Company was suggested. We again reminded Mr. Ellinger that the Forei&lt;m Office had already given him a good deal of support in this matter. Mr. Ellinger thought that something might be done with Mr. Strick in the direction of a contract, and he told me subsequently that he would write to Mr. Strick mild make a proposal. (Signed) A. WILSON FOX. November 3, 1908. I saw' Mr. Strick on Wednesday evening, the 4th November, at the Board of Trade. I informed him that 1 understood from Mr. Ellinger that he was not disposed to join a Company for the acquisition of iron oxide in Ormuz. I also said that I had told Mr. Ellinger that I thought it unlikely that he could get up a Company without Air. Strick’s support, and that, in any event, it was pretty certain that he could not do so unless the present terms offered by the Mouin w^ere considerably modified. I added that I had told Mr. Ellinger that if a Company could not be got up, the best thing to do was for him and Mr. Strick to come to terms, if possible on the lines of the proposals put forward in July and August last. I also informed Mr. Strick that Mr. Ellinger told me before we parted that he would make a proposal to Mr. Strick in writing on those lines. Mr. Strick again informed me that he would not take part in Mr. Ellinger’s proposed Company, and I then asked him if he would consider very carefully whether he could not take 20,000 tons of oxide at 425. Qd. a-ton, to be delivered within a period of about two and a-half years. I pointed out that if he let this opportunity go he might not get„ cth „, tulding .bat I did ... k... h.. »..h « .b.™ ™ - b “““ 5”'= *» the Germans, but of course there was some ns ma tter that there might be Mr. Strick said he had thou ^. v ^ y t “ r t U ‘!^ s V ; but he was prepared to face that, some little risk m the Germans g » j t ] ic Mouin were “ in a hole,” and he because he firmly helmed that Mi.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 294 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of the note I addressed to the Persian Government warning them against any attempt to obtain a pecuniary advance secured on the Hormuz Oxide Concession. Having in mind the instructions contained in your telegram No. 181 of the 20th July, as regards the extreme undesirability of this Concession falling into German hands, I thought it well to make it perfectly plain to the Persian Government that the alienation of the Hormuz Concession to a third party would be most distasteful to His Majesty’s Government, and trust that in making the inclosed communication I have correctly interpreted your wishes. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Mr. Marling to Ala-es-Sultaneh. Your Highness, Gulahelc, September 4, 1908. IT has come to my knowledge that the Persian Government contemplate obtaining a pecuniary advance to be secured by a Concession of the oxide mines in the Island of Hormuz. In these circumstances, it is my duty to remind your Highness of the conditions, communicated to your Highness in Sir Cecil Spring-Rice’s note of the 31st August, 1907, on which His Britannic Majesty’s Government agreed to the request of the Imperial Government for the suspension for three years of the sinking fund of the English loan of 1903-1904, one of which was the very natural and moderate stipulation that tl in accordance with the general law as to debtors and creditors, it is understood that the Persian Government on its side will not contract any new foreign loan without first giving their creditors, England and Russia, the option of advancing money on the same conditions.” No objection having been raised by the Persian Government to these conditions, His Britannic Majesty’s Government consider them, as I had the honour to inform your Highness in my note of the 25th July last, as definitely and irrevocably accepted, and it is my duty to point out to your Highness that in these circumstances the Persian Government is precluded from raising any loan or advance whatever without first giving to His Majesty’s Government the option of making that loan or advance on equal terms. I have, therefore, the honour to request your Highness to be so good as to inform me of any negotiations which may take place, either now or in the future, with the object of obtaining a pecuniary advance or loan, in order that I may submit the conditions to my Government in case they should wish to avail themselves of the conditions above mentioned. In this connection it is, I think, not inopportune that I should also remind your Highness that the interest on the English Loan of 1903-1904, which was due on the 4th April last has not been paid, and that so long as this obligation remains unfulfilled any attempt of the Persian Government to pledge the resources of the country for any other purpose is an act against which it would be my duty to make energetic protest. I shall be very glad if your Highness will be so good as to take the earliest opportunity of submitting the present communication to the consideration ot His Imperial Majesty the Shah.

Dear Mr. Wiison box September 26, VIIH reference to the letter to hand yesterday from Mr. Clarke, I will try and arrange to call upon you early next week and will make a definite appointment later. . In ,! he Runtime, I am pleased to be able to inform you that our efforts in conjunction with those of Mr. Marling, have been so far successful that the Mouin has now written us that he would be willing to form a Company upon lines which he indicates, but that a condition precedent to the formation of the Company is the receipt of satisfactory assurances of protection to be afforded to him and his sons by His ajesty s Government. It appears to me that if a Company with limited liability were registered in this country for the purpose of acquiring oxide on the Island of Ormuz Ills Majesty s Government would give absolute protection to the property of the Company and the Persian Government could not touch the oxide nor the shares in the Company, and that there would be no danger of the Concession being revoked or interfered with at the pleasure of the Persian Government, because His Maiesty’s Government would not allow it. Moreover, in the opinion of the solicitors we J have consulted, if any attempt were made by the Persian Government to interfere with the ownership of the shares acquired in this Company the Persian shareholders would have the protection of the English law behind them, and no English Company could be required to pay any regard whatever to an attempt made by an autocratic Government mereiy at its pleasure, and without any reference to the properly constituted laws and iegal 1 nbunals of Persia to arbitrarily deprive the Persian shareholders or their successors of their shares, and that the property in such a case would be absolutely secure to them and their heirs. J so ’ an( ^ ^ ^ ie M°m n and his five sons enter into an engagement with the Company to mine oxide in the Island of Ormuz, and to place it f.o.b. steamers would His Majesty s Government not be in a position to give assurances as to the protection of their lives and persons against any attempt of the Persian Government arb.traniy and without reference to the properly constituted laws and legal Tribunals ot the country to autocratically interfere or threaten their safety, so as to prevent them from carrying out the obligations into which they had entered ? I think if assurances on lines of this description could be given, coupled with assurances as to general protection to be given unofficially by His Majesty’s Legation in case of need, the oums views on this point would be satisfied, and we could then proceed to the consideration of the commercial aspects of the matter. I would suggest that when I meet you we should endeavour to procure the assistance of Sir Richmond Ritchie whose advice upon this point would be of considerable value, and for your convenience I am sending you a copy of this letter, which you can hand over to the India Office if you so desire, and I also send a copy to Mr. Mallet direct for the information of the EoreRn Umce. As regards the commercial side of the question, I think the best plan would be to put you novv in full possession of the Mouin’s ideas, so that you may have an opportunity ot considering the matter before we meet; and for this purpose, and in confidence I [1925 ee —12] m .Gli i-: .2 „ ;v „ vou an extract of what he writes in reference to the Company, of which nothin must be disclosed to Messrs.

In the course of this conversation Mr. Marling pointed out to the Moin how the formation of a British Company would strengthen his hold on his Concession, but in spite of his efforts he was unable to overcome the Moin’s hostility to the scheme. The Moin told Mr. Marling that he was shortly coming to Europe, and would discuss the matter with you, which would appear to show that he is confident of retaining his Concession, but anxious for the support of His Majesty’s Government to secure that object. 1 tell you this in order that, when the Moin broaches the subject with you, you may lay particular stress on the advantages which he would derive from the formation of a Company, and make every effort to obtain his consent to the scheme.

I pointed out to Moin how formation of a British Company would secure his possession, but he is plainly averse from that proposal. He said that he was going to Europe shortly, and would discuss it with Ellinger. This seems to show that he is confident of retaining Concession, but is anxious to have our support. I think he desires to keep concern entirely in his own hands, and that while (he) may not care by forming a British Company to give us any hold over him, he will probably hesitate to nm counter to Shah's wishes by making any permanent arrangement with Germans.

THANK you for your letter of tl.e 10th instant. It is, I agree, regrettable that, after all the trouble taken by you, Sir Richmond Ritchie, and Mr. Wilson Fox, the negotiations should have fallen through. Mj position was this: I made a firm offer to take 8,000 tons per annum for two and a-half years, ie 20,000 tons at 42s. 6,/., on the same terms as last contract. Messrs. Ehmger s reply, on behalf of the Mouinutojar, was that they would agree quantity and price, but coupled with certain conditions, which I detail for your information :— J 1. The responsibility for the protection of the oxide, of which 15,000 tons are stated to oe mined, and the remaining 5,000 tons to be ready in four months to rest entirely upon the buyers, i.e., my firm. 2. Payment to be made on the 31st of this month for 5,000 tons, i.e. 10 625Z. and the ba,lance at the rate of 500 tons in each month. “ Arabis? Ua ^ usua ^ but not superior to last shipment per L My firm to agree to allow Messrs. Wonckhaus to have 2,000 tons at 60s cif if required. ^oa 5 ‘ We t0 ta ^ e 0Ver the charter of the steam-ship &lt;c Auchendale/’ to carry o,500 tons, of which 2,500 tons must go to Germany, or incur extra freight for delivery in the Bristol Channel. My objections to these conditions are very serious, and may be summarized as follows:— 1. I understood after our various interviews that His Majesty’s Government would extend their support to my firm in case of difficulties arising in regard to delivery of the oxide at Ormuz f.o.b. our steamers, but it must not be overlooked that, by the terms of contract, we have to give what are practically promissory notes for the payment of the oxide on certain dates, whether we have or have not taken deliverv, and it is expressly provided that we shall raise no defence to any action taken to enforce payment under certain conditions. In fact, the whole contract is one of the most one-sided documents that has ever come before me. You will doubtless remember that at one of our interviews Mr. Wilson Fox made a remark to the effect that Messrs. Ellinger and Co. would be responsible for the due carrying out of the contract, and 1 replied that 1 could not see how Messrs. Ellinger and Co., acting as agents, could be held responsible, provided they merely carried out the instructions of their principal. Mr. Wilson Fox, however, did not agree with my view. 1 may mention that last week, in conversation with Mr. Ellinger, I raised the point of the responsibility of his firm, and he simply laughed at the idea. I may say that, so far as any recourse against the Mouinutojar is concerned, I have always regarded the contract as being worth no more than the paper on which it is written. 2. My objection to this condition is to some extent comprised in what I have written regarding No. 1. If we have given a definite undertaking to make payment as specified in the contract, we are in a poor position for recovering the cost of putting the oxide f.o.b. in case of the Mouinutojar failing to do so. 3. The shipment per “ Arabistan ” referred to is the worst shipment of oxide we have ever had, and it does not represent the usual quality of oxide mined and shipped at Ormuz. 4. By allowing Messrs. Wonckhaus to call on us to deliver 2,000 tons at 60.&lt;\ c.i.f., we should simply be putting ourselves in a position to be blackmailed, as, naturally, with a view to having the selling price maintained, we should be practically obliged to agree to whatever they liked to propose.

Ihey have also taken note of your statement that these measures require reasonable time to be successful, and that at least a period of three years is required for the achievement of these reforms and of the objects in view. at ^ey fully appreciate the sentiments expressed by your Highness on behalf of the JN ational Assembly as to the friendship existing between the two States, which thev sincerely reciprocate. ^ After duly considering the cod tents of your letter and the arguments which you nave so ably urged, they have instructed me to consent to the request of the Persian Government that a delay of three years may be allowed during which nothing should be paid on account of the sinking fund, but only interest, in order that the Persian Government and the National Representatives may have time to carry on the necessary relorms and to put the^ income and expenditure of the country on a proper footing. I am to add that, in consenting to this request, His Majesty’s Government under stands that the following conditions will be observed. kirstly, in accordance with the general law as to debtors and creditors, it is under stood that the Persian Government, on its side, will not contract any new foreign loan without giving their creditors, England and Russia, the option of advancing money on t e same conditions. The reason of this condition will be plain to you, for according to law and custom a debtor who makes an arrangement with a creditor must engage not to incur new debts from other quarters without first giving the option to his original creditor. Secondly, it is understood that the Persian Government, in the general interests of freedom of commerce, strictly maintains the promise made by the Attabek on the 27th October, 1901, and confirmed in the present year, to the effect that “the Persian Government will not grant to any one the monopoly of coining silver in the State Mint, and that in the matter of the importation of silver all persons, whether Persians or foreigners, will be treated equally and without distinction.” Thirdly, it is understood that His Majesty’s Government has consented to the request of the Persian Government and to waive the rights secured to them by eno^e- [2633 gg —22] J &amp; °Section 1, [26400] No. 1. ^ ^ # * ^ Foreign Office to Mr, F.

FOLLOWING from Bushire, No. 495 :— Tehran, July 19, 1908, 6*30 p.m. “ It is reported that Governor received a telegram last night from Minister of Finance, intimating cancellation of Moi-ut-Tujar’s lease of Minab, Hormuz, &amp;c.; that the Governor replied that he could manage all lands except Hormuz, which should be leased bv a merchant; that Customs recommended Brasseur, who had interviewed Governor this morning ; finally, that Governor telegraphed to-day, recommending that Tigran Malcolm should lease Hormuz. These are no doubt exaggerated, but there seems to be something in the wind. “ From our point of view, if Moi-ut-Tujar s lease is cancelled, Malcolm, as btncK s acrent, and as a man who has long experience of oxide business, and has leased Hormuz before, seems to be good selection. Remainder of Moi-ut-Tujar s lease or Kishm, Minab, &amp;c., ought, I think, to be under the Governor of the Gulf ports.

Should be glad to know true facts of case and your views to enable me to advise Messrs. Strick’s agents.” Muin admits that Persian Government is trying to cancel Concession, but he professes to be able, to maintaia it, and that Ellinger had received assurances from you of our support for him: He says German Legation has sounded him whether he would oppose lease'being given to a German firm by Persian Government.

Gulahek, June 17, 1908. I RECENTLY observed in tlie Bunder Abbas section of the Persian Gulf Diary a paragraph to the effect that 1,500 tons of red oxide were shipped by Messrs. Strick in the steam-ship “ Lauristan,” from Hormuz Island to London about the end of April. Being under the impression that Messrs. Strick’s contract with the Muin-et-Tujjar was to have expired on the 21st December last, I inquired by telegraph of His Majesty’s Consul-General under what arrangement Messrs. Strick were now shipping the oxide. In reply Major Cox telegraped that Mr. Malcolm, the Bushire agent of Messrs. Strick had reason to believe that his principals had concluded a secret contract with Muin-et-Tujjar, though they had not taken him into their confidence. Mr. Malcolm further stated that he had been approached by a certain Sadik-ul-Mamalek, an enemy of Muin-et-Tujjar ; this individual professed his ability to obtain a lease of Hormuz Island independently of Muin-et-Tujjar, provided that Mr. Malcolm would, in the capacity of a Persian subject, join him as a partner, or, failing that, be his guarantor as a British subject. Mr. Malcolm had not replied to these overtures ; he wished tor advice, and would not hesitate to join Sadik-ul-Mamalek, should his star appear to be in the ascendent and that of the Muin-et-Tujjar on the wane. . The whole transaction appeared to me to be of very doubtful honesty, while the suggestion that Mr. Malcolm should change his nationality, as best suited his temporary interests, lent it a particularly unpleasant complexion I accordingly replied to Major Cox that nothing was known at this Legation of Sadik-ul-Mamalek 01 of his abdi o obtain a transfer to himself of the lease of Hormuz Island; that I had no reason to believe that Muin-et-Tujjar’s position was weakened, and that m my opinion the transaction should be discouraged, at any rate until it became known whether Messrs.

Ellinger’s proposal for the formation of a Company to work his Concession of the red oxide mines on Hormuz Island. I believe that I was able to make the main lines of the proposal clear to him, but there were two questions on which I could not satisfy him, viz., whether it could not be arranged that the debentures could be paid off progressively instead of at the fixed date, 31st December, 1919, and, secondly, whether the u purchase money and shares,’' of which Messrs. Ellinger are to take 10 per cent, in cash and shares, include, besides the 50,000/. debentures and the 25,000/. ordinary shares, the 10,000/. 8 per cent, preference shares. Muin-et-Tujjar said he had already written to Messrs. Ellinger on these points. I did not gather from our interview that the Muin is by any means eager to come to an arrangement of the kind suggested ; not that he appears to be discontented with the terms, but because he fears that, by converting his Concession into a British Company, he will be placing himself in the power of this Legation, and that we should he able to bring pressure to bear on him in other questions where his interests conflict with those of British subjects, as, for instance, those of Messrs. Lynch. For a Persian, of course, such a point of view is quite natural, and it is difficult to persuade them that His Majesty’s Government are not in the habit of using methods of this kind, and it is unfortunately the fact that there are half-a-dozen cases in the settlement of which this Legation finds itself opposed by the Muin. I told him that once the Company was formed, the Legation would be legally bound to give it its best protection, and that so long as there were British shareholders in the concern he could trust them at all events to see that their interests were properly cared for. He had’ had dealings for many years with Messrs. Ellinger, and, if he had the same confidence in them that they reposed in him, he need feel no uneasiness, but that they would safeguard their joint interests to the best of their ability, and see that the concern obtained the assistance and protection to which, as a British Company, it would be entitled at the hands of His Majesty’s Government. As I said before, Muin-et-Tujjar seems fairly contented with the terms offered,, and, if Messrs. Ellinger are ready to satisfy him on the two points mentioned in the earlier part of this despatch, I believe that the best chance of bringing him to enter into the combination will be to persuade him that he can count on the fullest measure of our support and that we shall not and cannot, in respect of other questions, make any improper use of the position of dependency on us in which he will be placed as regards the Oxide Company. From what he has told Abbas Kuli Khan, there can be no doubt that Muin-et- Tujjar is thinking of some similar arrangement with a German house, presumably Messrs. Wonckhaus, and it is quite possible that his cold reception of Messrs. Ellinger s proposals may be no more than an attempt to extract more advantageous terms by pretending that the German offer is more profitable, but I am myself inclined to believe that for once the Muin has given the true motive of his attitude. He has, I extend its commercial interests, rather than under tnat oi wear Britain wiia wuose \ I.egation he might be brought into conflict on issues quite foreign to that of the Oxide CONFIDENTIAL.

I shall be glad to have from you by telegraph any corrections of statement of facts or criticism of specific points in Grerman case as shown in these papers. Cox should on no account enter into any sort of discussion but should only observe. It would be desirable that some official should visit Abu Musa to ensure that all proper facilities are given to Wonckhaus for removing accumulated oxide without trouble or conflict with Sheikh or his men. Number of tons of oxide so removed should be ascertained, as this information will be material if Wonckhaus puts forward claim for compensation on account of loss under his contract. No new mining should proceed pending further decision. We have informed German Government of this condition, but have told them that Wonckhaus may remove oxide already mined.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote Xo. and address The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. 41741/07. ~ Immediate.

Grey to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before Mr. Secretary Morley, copy of a letter from ment has been revised in accordance with the result / of the communications which have already passed be tween the India and Foreign Offices and which was comminicated privately to Messrs Ellinger and Com pany. The proposed enterprise appears to Sir E. Grey to be a most desirable one which is deserving of cordial that firm which they request may be substituted for their previous letter of October 19th. It will be seen that the text of the assurances which Messrs. Ellinger desire to receive from His Majesty's Govem- The Under Secretary of State, India Office.) i ’ i ' '- cordial support from His Majesty’s Government. He is therefore disposed, subject to Mr. Morley’s con currence, to give to Messrs Ellinger end Company the assurances asked for subject to the condition that they will only hold good so long as the enterprise remains British. I am, however, to draw Mr. Morley’s attention to the fact that the grant of these assurances in volves the support by His Majesty’s Government of a monopoly of the export of red oxide from Hormuz and that consequently it will be inconsistent for His Majesty’s Government to justify the action of the Sheikh of Shargah in regard to Messrs Wonckhaus’ contract for the export of red oxide from Abu Musa on the ground that it created a monopoly. Mr. Morley is aware that Sir E. Grey has not suggested, in the letter from this Department of the — ;/ .? instant, that the question of a monopoly should be raised in replying to the German Government but in view of the fact that the Government of India based their recommendation to the Sheikh to cancelthe Abu Musa Concession on that ground, he is of opinion that an understanding should be arrived at with the Government of India as to the basis on which the reply to the German Government should be framed, so as to exclude the argument in regard to a monopoly, as to the validity of which he has always felt great doubts. Sir E. Grey would be glad to be favoured with an early answer to this communication. I am.

Haii Agha Mohamed Mouin-ut-Tujar, of Tehran and Bushire, some years ago obtained from the Shah’s Government a Concession to exploit the Island of Ormuz, and he has now for some years systematically mined the red oxide of iron winch is on the island in very considerable quantities, and the ore has been shipped to Europe and the States, where it enjoys great popularity under the various names of Gulf Red, Persian Red, Ormuz Red, &amp;c. This oxide of iron produces a shade of colour which is always in demand, and which appears to he unobtainable otherwise than hy the use of this oxide of iron. . ± p a,™ The Mouin, having occasion to acquire for purposes of development of other interests in Persia a considerable amount of money in cash, has requested us, who have for many years eared for the sale of his oxide, and acted generally in this country as his agents, to so arrange that he is put in possession of a sum of 50,0001. m cash In order to effect this, we propose to register here a limited Company which will issue debentures for 50,000/., bearing interest at 7 per cent, (or 4g per cent, if we can get them guaranteed by a financial institution), and repayable 31st December, 1919, and with a capital of 10,000/. preference shares to be subscribed ^LFono/ 0 ordfnarv Mouin and to serve as “ working capital in case of need, and -5,000/. ordi y shares fuUy paid iqK t]le Mouin all the oxide on the Island of Ormuz, which the En would undertake to put free on board at Ormuz as hitherto done by him The Mouin to receive in payment 50,000/. cash and all the ordinal y shares.

The above figures show the steady progress of the business as the oxide has become better known to and appreciated by the trade. The purchase price is not to be paid to the Mouin until satisfactory reports are obtained by expert engineers as to the quantity of oxide on the island being amply sufficient to secure the debentures. On these or similar lines we anticipate no difficulty in getting the necessary funds from our friends, provided we can obtain from you the assurances which would be deemed icquisite for the adequate protection of the property proposed to be secured, and these assurances would in our opinion require to be of the following nature :— 5 ?-* That, so far as His Majesty s Government are aware, the Concession to the Mouin is in perpetuity.
