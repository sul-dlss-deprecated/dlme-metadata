It was used as a sculptor's trial piece and has a very rough outline of a head apparently that of Akhenaten. It is in the extreme Tell el-Amarna style, but the workmanship is exceptionally crude. It was either the work of a beginner, or was discarded shortly after it was begun. The profile which is ordinarily well done betrays an inexperienced hand. The back is unfinished. \r\nCondition: The remaining portion is in good condition.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment", "dimensions": "5 11/16 x 4 5/16 x 1 1/8 in.
