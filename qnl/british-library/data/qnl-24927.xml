Sir, With reference to the teleo-mm p r L India Office, 6th November 1907 regarding the flagstaff on Telegraph Island. The Government of India were requested, m Mr. Brodrick’s Secret Despatch of the 19th May 1905, mfoimmg them of the leasons for which Ills Majesty's Government had decided that the flag-staffs erected in 1904 on Sheep Island and Maklab sthmus must be abandoned, to take into consideration the question of the maintenance of the flagstaff on Telegraph Island, both on grounds of general policy, and in view of the evidence showing the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat over the island. 2. It appears to Mr. Morley that, apart from any question of the rights of the Sultan of Muscat, the reasons of policy which led to the decision of 1905, apply equally to the case of Telegraph Island, though the status of the island differs from that of the rest of the Peninsula, inasmuch as it was occupied by us from 1864 to 1869 in connection with the operations of the Eastern Telegraph Department. The claims of the Sultan of Muscat to the coast forming the promontory of Musandim were admitted by His Majesty’s Government in the counter draft presented to the Hague Tribunal in the Muscat Arbitration. 5. Mr. Morley would propose, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that the Government of India should be instructed that the flagstaff should not be maintained, though it need not be removed, as to do this might attract undesirable attention. 4. As regards the general question of British interests in the Persian Gulf, it seems sufficient to observe that the policv embodied in Lord Lansdowne’s statement of the 8th May 1903 in the* House of Lords, on which His Majesty’s Government relied in 1905 as preferable to that of erecting the flagstaffs in question, has been re-affirmed in Sir E. Grey’s Despatch of the 29th August 190/ to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, on the subject of the Convention with Russia concerning Persia. bir &gt; . 9th May 1908.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. ^ FOREIGN DEPARTMENT SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., Sis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 26th September 1907. Sir, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with our telegram, dated the 11th November 1905, regarding the maintenance of British flagstaffs at Cape Musandim. 2. In our telegram, dated the 22nd July 1905, we stated that there might be some advantage in retaining the flagstaff on Telegraph Island as an evidence that our right to re-occupy the island was not affected by the assertion of the Sultan’s sovereignty over it subsequent to the original occupation. We suggested that this question might, however, he discussed with the Sultan after the promulgation of the award of the Hague Arbitration tribunal relative to Maskat dhows flying the French flag. 3. On reconsidering the question, we have arrived at the conclusion that it would be preferable not to address the Sultan at all in the matter; since it appears certain that the Award negotiations, which are now on the point of conclusion, will not affect the definition of the limits of Maskat territory. 4. The flagstaff might conceivably be useful in certain circumstances having regard to the German desire for an increase of influence in the Gulf and for a telegraph line to the east; and as neither the Sultan nor any foreign power has ever taken exception to its existence, it seems very improbable that any international complications will arise from its maintenance in the future. We have already given it as our opinion that the erection of the flagstaffcannot be regarded as contravening, in any way, the provisions of the Treaty of 1862 which hinds both France and England not to trench upon the inde pendence of the Sultan of Maskat; and in these circumstances, we propose, if you approve, merely to leave the flagstaff where it is. We have the honour to be, Sib, Your most obedient, humble servants, /ucT cm. ^ —^£) 1907 . SIMLA. FOREIGN EEP^RTMENT. SECRET. External. No, 161, dated the 26th Septembee 1907.

I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE,/ COPY CONFIDENTIAL 'Hyacinth' at Colombo, 5th September 1905. No:- II. Sir, With reference to the statement in Government of India Memorandum regarding external affairs for July 1905, that Elphinstone Inlet might be useful for a War Sig nal Station instead of Khor Kawi, be pleaded to acquaint His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council that I wish to place on record my opinion that Elphinstone Inlet is not at all adapted as a Naval Signal Station, or as a place of arms for the Navy, whereas Khor Kawi is quite an ideal position for Cruisers watching the entrance to the Gulf. Moreover, if it became necessary to use it as a flying base where colliers and storeships would be sent, it could be easily defended. After the survey which I caused to be made, this was proved to be a position of great value to the Navy under certain circumstances. 2.- Elphinstone Inlet and Telegraph Island are in my opinion, of no strategic value whatever; they are too far from Musandem Point to be useful as points of observation - Telegraph Island is some 7 miles from .the entrance, the water to anchor in is very deep, and it is on record that the heat of the place caused it to be abandoned as a telegraph station. 2.- Khor Kawi on the other hand, commands the entrance to the Gulf entirely, and by establishing a temporary signal station The Secretary The Government of India* FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.station on the hill to the East of the Northern entrance, the Straits of Oman can be kept under observation within the range of a good telescope, and Snips lying in Khor Xawi can, by means of wireless telegraphy, communicate with Henjam. Both entrances to tne Khor are narrow and therefore easily defended, if necessary; and although the tides are fairly strong, they are not to be compared in strength to Bombay Harbour, for instance, and the depth of water, from 12 to 16 fathoms, is such that a large Squadron of Armoured Cruisers with accompanying auxiliaries can find a safe and convenient anchorage within the Khor, whence they can quickly get to sea if they want th chase. 4.- Khor Kawi in the old sailing days would not have been a suitable place, because when a ship once got in there and depended on sails to get out, she might be un able to move for days; therefore in old sailing directions Khor Kawi is not recommended.

[Note. This memorandum is based upon reports, the accuracy of which it is not always possible to guarantee.] PERSIA.. 1. Tehran .—In a despatch, dated the 12th May, Sir A. Hardinge states that, during the last week in April, the principal merchants of Tehran closed their offices and shops, and proceeded in a body to the Shrine of Shah Abdul Azin as a protest against the vexatious and unjust manner in which they declare they are treated by M. Naus’s Customs administration. Speaking on the matter to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, M. Naus stated that he contemplates retiring from the Persian service soon after the Shah’s return from Europe. His idea is to obtain some high financial, or administrative, post in Belgium. 2. TheVazir Makhsus, who was Minister of Justice in the time of the Atabeg-i-Azam, has been appointed to act as intermediary between the Prince Regent and the Council of Ministers, and seems likely to acquire thereby a very considerable influence. He is a friend of the Atabeg-i-Azam, and a secret opponent of the present Grand Vizier. 3. (Vide paragraph 4 of Memorandum for June 1905.) His Majesty’s Government have decided that it is desirable to offer to the Persian Government an advance of £150,000 in the same manner and on the same terms as in the case of the two previous loans. The Government of India have signified their willingness to join in the loan. 4. (Fkte paragraph 1 of Memorandum for May 1905.) The Shah has abandoned his contemplated visit to the Russian Court. His Majesty has informed the Vali Ahd that he will reach the Persian frontier on the 3rd September. 5. Meshed .—The Russian Consul-General and the head of the Russian Bank are said, on native authority, to have been discussing the project of a Meshed-Tehran Railway, and it is further said that the Mushir-ed-Howleh has promised a reply on this subject to the Russian Minister on the Shah’s return from Europe. It is reported that a Russian, supposed to be an Engineer, has reached Meshed, and will travel thence to Tehran to examine the road.Mb Mm*?*. r 2 ] 6. JJrumia Murders .—In view of the difficulties attendant on the punishment of the Kurds by the Persian Government, a proposal is under consideration to encourage the Kurds to make peace with the Christians. Put such a peace may involve a modification of some of the terms on which the American Government (Memorandum for April, para graph 11) has insisted, and it remains to be seen in what light the proposal will be viewed at Washington. 7. Arabistan .—According to reports received from Major Morton, K.E., the officer specially deputed to investigate and report on the possibilities of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme for the irrigation of the province of Arab istan {vide paragraph 9 of the Memorandum for May), there is not, in any conceivable circumstances, the remotest possibility of such scheme paying, and it should be con demned for various reasons, even if it did pay. lo carry out the scheme as devised by Mr. Van Roggen would necessitate a capital outlay of Rs. 3,36,89,000, in return for which an annual income of Rs. 13,48,500 might be expected. Of this latter amount it is anticipated that the Persian Government would claim half and deducting a sum of lakhs on account of the up-keep and maintenance of the works, the net revenue would amount to about 5^ lakhs, which would not be sufficient to pay more than about 1J % on the capital outlay. If any scheme of irri gation is to be carried out, it must, in expert opinion, be one of the very simplest kind, and one^ that will pay financially and fairly well. Major Morton’s views as to the possibility of any alternative scheme have not yet been received. # 8. Sir A. Hardinge reports that the Azim-es-Sultaneh has been succeeded as Gov ernor of Arabistan by the Salar-i-Moazzam (a nephew of the Kizam-es-Sultaneh), who was formerly Governor of the Gulf Ports. Though friendly on the whole to British interests, he is reported to be timid and hardly likely to do much towards restoring order in Arabistan, and Sir A. Hardinge has already had to complain to the Persian Government of his having failed to supply guards to the S.S. “Shushan ”, and interdicted on his own authority the export of food-supplies from the district of Shuster. 9. The Pirman Pirmah has now been operating against the Lurs for the last six months, but with no result {vide paraoranh 9 of the Memorandum for June). HeTas not enough troops, ammunition, or food-stuffs to * he . Lurs &gt; who ridicule the enorts of the Persians against them. Inform ation was, however, received, on the 24th July, that twelve Direkwand Chiefs, includ ing six of those who were concerned in the\ U\ ■4p\ ) i [ 3 ] attack on Colonel Douglas and Lieutenant Lorimer, had been captured, presumably by treachery. 10. Bushire .—A Frenchman, named Alexandre, connected with the Sugar Refineries of St. Louis, who visited the Gulf two years ago as Secretary to M. Jouannin, Secretary to the “ Comite de 1’Asi^ Francaise ”, arrived at Bushire in the “ Persepolis ” on the 21th June from Moham- merah, to which place he had come from Basrah. It is reported that he intends to import from St. Louis, and store in Bushire, large quantities of sugar in the hope of mono polising the trade. 11. Petty robberies are again prevalent in the outskirts of Bushire and are announced by the local authorities to be the work of Tangistanis, but incidents which occurred during the Darya Begi’s last Governorship give rise to the report that these robberies are instigated by the Governor himself when he is in straits for money. 12. The Darya Begi left Bushire on the 8th instant in the Persian gun-boat “ Perse polis ” for Dilam to instal Morad Khan, uncle of Hyder Khan of Bunder Rig, as the Deputy Governor, but the present incumbent and his supporters objected to have Morad Khan. The Darya Begi consequently returned to Bushire on the 10th, and is now collecting levies before returning to Dilam with Morad Khan. 13. The merchants of Bushire have presented a memorandum to the Director- General of Customs, setting forth their com plaints against certain articles of the R6gle- ment Douanier (vide Memorandum for June, paragraph 16). Briefly, the objection is that the R&amp;glement Douanier has been framed on the model of some European Customs Tariff, but without any regard to local conditions; and that, for this reason, several of the condi tions laid down in the Persian Tariff are im practicable at Bushire. 14. Sir Arthur Hardinge, in a despatch of the 24th June, states that the Mushir- ed-Dowleh has addressed a note to the Russian Minister, making representations as to the disturbed state of the province of Erivan, and Trans-Caucasia generally, and pointing out that it constitutes a danger to the lives and security of Persian subjects. The Erivan Mussulmans have, in fact, informed their co-religionists at Tabriz that many of them have been killed by Armenians, and have urged reprisals on the Armenians of Tabriz. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh and the chief ecclesiastics of both religions, seconded by the influence of the Consulates-General, have so far succeeded in preserving peace.[ 4 ] 15. On the July. Sir Arthur Hardinge telegraphed that *M. Naus had informed him confidentially that the Amin-cs- Sultan had had two long private interviews with the Shah in Prance, and lie believes that he will return to Persia with IIis Majesty, and regain his old position of Grand Vizier. 16. Mr. Churchhill (H. MAs Vice- Consul at Resht) reported on the 7th June that considerable sensation has been caused both at Resht and Enzeli by the Japanese victory over Admiral Rojdjestvensky’s fleet. 17. Prince Bibesco has been appointed by the King of Roumania Special Envoy Extraordinary for the purpose of presenting to the Shah the Grand Cordon of the Star of Roumania. This compliment is a reply to the notification to the Roumanian Court of the Shah’s intention to present to King Charles the Order of Timsal in Jewels. 18. As the Shah will not be able to receive the Envoy until his return from Europe to Tehran in the autumn, Prince Bibesco and his party are making an unofficial tour through out Persia, and will return to Tehran in Octo ber. 19. Sir Arthur Bardinge has been in formed confidentially that negotiations are in progress for a treaty of commerce between Persia and Roumania. 20. British Post Offices in Persia .—In regard to the proposed postal agreement with Persia (Memorandum for June, paragraph 11), M. Naus professes a great desire to con clude a postal convention with the Government of India, and would like a representative of the Indian Post Office to be sent to Tehran to negotiate, or to assist Sir Arthur Hardinge in negotiating it. 21. An incident has occurred at Lingah in connection with the payment of the debts of a British Indian trader named Gordhandass. The British Agent took possession of this trader’s valuables with a view to a proper distribution of the assets among the creditors. But the Deputy Governor, a Lari, demanded on 23rd May that the whole of the assets should be handed to a certain Lari creditor on the plea that he had been appointed Agent for the rest. On the Agent refusing to agree, his residence was besieged from 28th May to 16th June. His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas visited Lingah during that period, and in consequence of his report, the Deputy Gov ernor was ordered by the Darya Begi to apologise to Mr. Shakespear. This he has done verbally, but Mr. Shakespear is insisting on receiving a written apology. 22. There seems to be no ground for the supposition tiiat the conduct of the Native Agent in this case has been otherwise than[ s ] correct and straightforward. lie has, however, lately been unpopular with the community at Lingah and with the local authorities at Bushire owing to the fact that, during the last few months, an unusual number of negroes have taken refuge with him claiming freedom, and have subsequently been manumitted according to the usual procedure. The Belgian Customs Director, M. Bourgeois, has evidently been backing the Deputy Governor in his attitude, for, apart from our Agent’s reports, the Darya Begi’s Mustofi showed to the Political Besident’s First Assistant a certificate which His Excellency had received from his Deputy Governor, furnished and signed by M. Bourgeois, and stating that the Laris had not besieged the British Agency, but had taken “ bast” there, or words to that effect. It seems to be the Darya Begi’s intention to depose his Deputy, but Major Cox has asked Sir Arthur Hardinge to press for the Deputy Governor’s removal at Tehran if the Darya Begi endeavours to back out of it, as he perhaps will, if Haji Taleb Khan offers him a sufficient inducement. 23. Kerman.—{Vide paragraph 20 of Memorandum for .Tune 1905.) A petition bear ing 377 seals was received by the British Consul, objecting to the appointment of the Amir-ul- Umra (a Sheikhi) as Vizier, and asking him to approach the Governor-General with a view to the Vizier’s dismissal. On 2nd June, when His Majesty’s Consul informed the Governor- General of the petition he had received, he was told that Amir-ul-Umra had resigned the post of his own accord. A Council of five members was organised on the resignation of the Amir-ul-Umra, but one of its members has since resigned. 24. A Mulla who had been turned out of Kerman and sent to Meshed by Shabab-ul- Mamalik, ex-Deputy Governor, on account of his preaching against Sheikhis, Parsis, and Faranghis, has been brought back by the insistance of the people. He is living with Aga Bakir, a big Mulla of the place, and the people visit him in large numbers. 25. ( Vide paragraph 21 of Memorandum for June 1905.) The Customs masters of Cheroo and Kelat who returned to their posts were forthwith expelled by the inhabitants. The Customs master of Mukam was not allow ed by the people to enter the Custom House and was told that, if he remained in Mukam and was killed, they would not be responsible. The Customs masters then repaired to Lingah in order to complain of the treatment they had been subjected to. The matter is now before the Director of Customs.[ ^ ] 26. Information lias been received that, at tho end of May, some inhabitants of Lar landed about 600 rifles with cartridges, some revolvers, and several packages of aniline dyes and indigo at Cheroo. The Director of Cus toms at Lingah has given orders for the confiscated goods to be handed over to the Customs authorities. 27. Henjam .—In regard to the friction with the Customs Mirza on lien jam (Memo randum for June, paragraph 23), Major Cox telegraphed to Sir Arthur Ilardinge on the 28th June, repeating a report from the Superintendent of Telegraphs, Henjam, that the male population of the Arab village of that island being away at the pearl-fisheries, the Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas proceeded to Henjam on the 25th June in the Customs steamer, and visited the Arab village, where only a few men remained in charge of the women. He invited a Persian of Kishm, who is dwelling among the Arabs, to become the Persian Customs Mirza of the village on a salary of krans 2,000 a year. The Director promised to erect a house and flagstaff for him similar to that erected on the north side of the island. He added that there was no intention to farm the Customs, but that the measures proposed were necessary in order to prevent Englishmen from claiming the island later on. Major Cox added that the Arab Sheikh of the village was expected in a few days from the pirate coast, and asked what line should be taken if the Sheikh referred to H. M/s Consul at Bunder Abbas, or to himself. 28. On the 29th June, Sir Arthur Hardinge telegraphed that he had addressed a strong protest to the Minister of Customs against the language used by the Director of Customs into which, he said, he should hold an enquiry, and that ho had requested an explanation. 29. Sir Arthur Hardinge’s view is that we must recognise such consequences of Persian Sovereignty as the presence of flags and a Customs officer on Henjam, but that, if the Persians actually oppress the Arabs and if any of the latter come to the telegraph station for sanctuary, he will take the matter up at Tehran and protect them. But in the mean time, he informed Major Cox, the Arab Sheikh should be warned that we recognise Henjam as part of Persia, and that, if his people attack the telegraph or Customs officials, British and Persian soldiers will probably be sent to Henjam. 30. On the 5th July, Major Cox tele graphed that the Telegraph Superintendent had informed him by wire that he had got hu© t 7 ] informant’s signed statement as to what took place at the Customs Director’s visit (para graph 27 above), and also a statement attested by all persons who were present at the con versation, and that they were to the same effect as the original report. 31. Bassidore .—On the 25th June, Major Cox reported that the Moin-ut-Tujjar had asked permission to store red ochre in our station on Bassidore. He had addressed Tehran on the subject, and deprecated compliance with the Moin-ut-Tujjar’s request. In view of the fact that Sir Arthur Hardinge had stigmatised the Moin as a person who con sistently opposed British interests and at the present time is endeavouring to lay claim to the ground which the Indian Government desire to rent for the Ahwaz Consulate, the Government of India agreed with the views held by Major Cox. 32. Shiraz .—The Governor-General of Shiraz has arrested and proposes to execute several of the road-guards of the Bushire- Shiraz road for their misdeeds which have be come intolerable. 33. Constant and daring robberies north and south of Dehbid on the Shiraz-Ispakan road have been reported. 31. About 2nd June, a fanatical move ment directed by Mirza Ibrahim, a leading Mulla, against the Jews was started in the Moslem quarters, and their felt kolahs (caps) were torn to pieces, the Moslems demanding that the Jews should wear a distinctive head dress. His Majesty’s Consul has addressed a note to the Governor-General, and paid a visit to the Jewish quarter. The Jew baiting continued throughout the month. An order has now been issued by the Salar- ul-Sultan, ordering all Jews to wear felt skull caps, and those wearing high kolahs to wear a piece of yellow stuff on the collars of their coat. MM. Schocher and Venugiani, Profes sors of the Jewish school, were summoned before the Prince and Sardar-i-Akram, and were warned to confine themselves to their school work. 35. Quarantine .—In furtherance of the scheme for providing a superior class of Euro pean Military Assistant Surgeons for quarantine work in the Persian Gulf (vide Memorandum for April, paragraph 29), Military Assistant Surgeon Stewart has been directed to proceed to Jask to relieve Assistant Surgeon McMillan at present in charge of quarantine and the Indo-European Telegraph dispensary there. Simla ; a C. SOMERS COCKS, The 1st August 1905. )Memorandum of information received during the month of July 1905, regarding external affairs relating to Arabia. [Non.—This memorandum is based upon reports, tb* accuracy of which it is not always possible to guarantee.] ADEN. 1. On the 28th June 1905, the Resident at Aden received information that the S. S. “ Heathburn ” was stranded on the Arabian Coast near Khor Omera, between Aden and Perim. At the same time, information was also received from the Perim Coal Company, who are salving her, that the attitude of the natives was threatening, and the Resident in consequence despatched the R. I. M. S. “Dalhousie” with a small detachment of Native Infantry, under the command of a British officer, to give the necessary protection to life and property. Prom the report of the Commander of the “ Dalhousie ”, it transpires that the fears of the salvage party were unfounded, as the tribesmen’s intentions seemed peaceful, and they came to the shore merely in the hopes of picking up some WTeckage. 2. Colonel R. I. Scallon, C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., has assumed charge at Aden, as General Officer Commanding and Political Resident, on the 15th June 1905, from which date Major-General H. M. Mason proceeded on four months’ leave. 3. The Political Officer at Dthala has submitted proposals for the establishment of a temporary dispensary at that place, with the object of giving free medical attendance to any Arabs who may come in for treatment, and thereby establishing a greater influence with the tribes in the interior. These proposals are now under consideration. 4. (See sub-paragraph 4 of paragraph 1 of Memorandum for April 1905.) The Assistant Resident at Perim informed the Resident at Aden that a certain number of the tribesmen in the vicinity of Sheikh Said, belonging to the Maiba, Hakami, and Moza tribes, on the Turkish side of the border, are now raising objections to the recent erection of • boundary pillars at Sheikh Said without their being consulted. The complainants have been told to submit their representations to the Turkish authorities within whose terri tories they reside. The Resident has no reason to think that the objections are of any real consequence. . .rnmmmmmam [ 2 ] 5. Two Turkish officers from the garrison at Kataba recently proceeded to Aden to purchase supplies. 6. It was decided during the month to recall the half battalion, 94th Russell’s Infantry, from Aden, and to replace them by a whole battalion of Native Infantry. This small increase was considered advisable on political grounds. 7. The Secretary of State telegraphed on the 19th July 1905 that it was understood from a letter addressed to the Government of Bombay that the Government of India no longer recommended the erection of additional pillars, and that Mr. Pitzmaurice was of opinion that the alternative proposal to improve the exist ing pillars along the Amiri border would cause trouble with the Turks, who would accuse the Amir of tampering w r ith the boundary. In these circumstances, ho was not inclined to take any action on Major Merewether’s report of 15th November 1904, and enquired whether the Government of India were inclined to share the same opinion. ' 8. The Secretary of State was informed in reply that the Government of India still considered that the erection of additional pillars would be the best course if and when feasible, and meanwhile the measures detailed in the letter to the Government of Bombay of 30th April 1905 should be regarded as necessary, not so much to improve existing pillars, as to preserve them from disappearing altogether. They adhered, therefore, to their view; and to prevent the benefit of demar cation being lost, preferred to insist on it being the Amir of Dthala’s duty to repair the pillars annually; in order to prevent the accusation anticipated by Mr. Pitzmaurice, it was thought that formal notice might first be given to the Turkish authorities. (Por proceedings of the Imam, see Turkish Arabia.) TURKISH ARABIA. 9. In connection with the question of the status in the Ottoman dominions of sub jects of Native States in India, His Majesty’s Government have decided that the same measure of protection may properly be extend ed to British protected persons abroad as to British subjects, except in so far as the right or power to exercise such protection depends upon a treaty, agreement, or statutory enact ment, which excludes or cannot be construed as including such protected persons. The measure of protection which may be accorded must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. With regard to the Ottoman dominions, His Majesty’s Government hold that there ist 3 ] nothing in the Capitulations to prevent them from placing British protected persons on the same footing as British subjects in the matter of jurisdiction, and they consider that the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899 in its defini tion of British subjects plainly asserts this right, which has not been disputed by the Turkish Government. 10. {Vide paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 of the Memorandum for June 1905.) It is reported that Lieutenant-Genernl Kyamil Pasha, Com manding the Redifs of the Damascus Army Corps, who left for the Yemen in order to preside over the court-martial which was to be held in that province, returned to Damascus from Port Said on the plea of ill-health. It is understood that his colleague, Major-General Ali Mansour Pasha from Aleppo will succeed him. 11. News has reached the Turkish Gov ernment that the insurrection in the province of Assir, where the Sheikh Ali-bin-Ayiz is reported to be inciting the tribes to revolt and to be blockading Ebha, the capital of the Sanjak, has again assumed alarming proportions. Energetic military measures have been decided upon, and the 19th (Karput) Nizam division of the 4th Army Corps, is to be sent to Conf udah, eight battalions being ordered to march at once to Alexandretta for embarkation. The strength of these battalions is to be raised to 1,000 men each, by calling out the men of the active reserves to rejoin the colours. 12. After making a liberal allowance for casualties and deaths during the siege of Sana and desertions, the present strength of the Turkish army in the Yemen is estimated roughly at 40,000 men. The force is said to have suffered a loss of quite 20,000 men from all causes since the outbreak of the present rebellion. There has been an exchange of telegrams between the Imam and the Sultan for some time past with the result that Sheikh Muhammad Dalai, hitherto exiled in Rhodes, and Mahmoud Bey have been ordered by an Imperial Irade to proceed to Sana, where the Imam has now arrived. The hope is enter tained generally that some understanding will he soon arrived at dispensing with the neces sity for further military operations. 13. It is reported that the Turks have abandoned Kataba fearing treachery at the hands of certain Sheikhs in the district. A proclamation is said to have issued from the Imam to all the Sultans generally, announcing to them his victory over the Turks. 14. Hedjaz .—The Syrian caravan travell ed this year from Damascus to Maan by railway, and thence followed the Haj route to Medina and Mecca on camels {vide paragraph 6 of the Memorandum for April 1905).t 4 ] 15. It appears that military requirements have diverted the attention of the authorities from the Medina line to the one from Maan to Akaba. The work of construction on this line is progressing more rapidly than that of Medina, and is expected to be completed in one year {vide paragraph 4 of the Memorandum for December 1904). PERSIAN GULP. 16. Maskat.—(Vide paragraph 7 of Memorandum for April 1905.) A copy of the final text of the proposed revised treaty of commerce was transmitted to the Secretary of State for India on the 2nd July for the approval of His Majesty’s Government, prior to its negotiation with the Sultan. 17. (Fwte paragraph 11 of Memorandum for June 1905.) Major Cox forwarded a copy of a letter from the Political Agent at Maskat, in which that officer suggested as the outcome of report called for on the 25th May last (vide paragraph 14 of Memorandum for May 1905), in connection with the Masirah incident, that for every murderer surrendered one prisoner be released, the prisoners not so released to remain in confinement up to a period not exceeding three years from the date of their incarceration. The proposals were approved, and Major Grey was instructed through the Political Resident to inform the Sultan accordingly, but without mentioning as yet the intended limitation of the'period of imprisonment to three years. A report was also to be furnished to the Government of India on the occasion of each surrender and release. 18. [Vide paragraph 11(2) of Memo randum for June 1905.] Major Grey reported that the Erench Vice-Consul with Madame Billecocq returned to Maskat in a dhow on the 30th June 1905 (not 13th June as previously noted). W1 ei asked why he did not return in the “ Lapwing ”, M. Billecocq replied that he could not make use of an English vessel, while the present Arbitration case was pending r although he saw no objection to using the Sultan’s steamer (which however was refused), as, in his opinion, the latter had nothing to do with the Arbitration case. 19. ‘ [ Vide paragraph 11(3) of Memo randum for June 1905.] A good trade in arms appears to be going in the south-east corner of Persia. The arms are supposed to come from Maskat, and the procedure generally pursued is as follows :— One or two men set out from their homes and proceed to Maskat either by Gwadur or Charbar, whichever most convenient. After having purchased rifles, they hire a small boat and wake their way to some safe spot along[ c ] the coast, avoiding both Charbar and Gwadur, thence proceeding north. If necessary, they purchase a few donkeys at Maskat and bring them with them in a boat. 20. [ Vide paragraph 11(5) of Memo randum for June 1905.] Major Cox repeated a telegram from Major Grey enquiring when the Hague Tribunal would assemble, and whether the French could still send despatches to be placed before the Tribunal, as he was assured that the French Consul was still trying to secure a confession of weakness from the Sultan. Major Grey further telegraphed direct to the Government of India that the point was that he could not reasonably expect to be able to explain the delay much longer to the satisfaction of the Sultan. He was informed through Major Cox on the 25th July that, according to the latest information, the argu ments were due on 10th July; the Tribunal would meet on 25th July; and a decision be given on 24th August 1905 ; hence despatches now sent by French Consul would only be available under paragraph 3 of Article III of the Agreement of 13th October 1904. 21. (Vide paragraph 15 of Memorandum for June 1905.) Major Cox telegraphed on the 14th July, in connection with the maintenance of flagstaffs on Telegraph Island, that Major Grey was of the opinion that, in the circums tances, there was no advantage in maintain ing a flagstaff, and considered that it might be abandoned with the other two; but that, if for any reason it was thought necessary to retain it, he could arrange it with the Sultan. It appeared to Major Cox that, if Henjam were turned into a sanitary station, Great Britain would want some other place at the entrance to the Persian Gulf for a war signal station, and Elphinstone Inlet might have been useful for this purpose, instead of Klior Kawi; but if the reoccupation of Telegraph Island would constitute a parallel to the Bunder Gisseh incident, he saw no alternative but to abandon the flagstaff for the present, and trust to seiz ing the locality when necessity for it actually arises. In his opinion, our claims to the island on telegraph grounds would be as good ten years hence as they are at the present moment. Alter considering the views of the local officers, the Secretary of State was in formed by telegraph, on the 22nd July, that it was proposed to defer, until the declaration of the Maskat Arbitration Award, the actual. removal of the staffs on Isthmus and Sheep Island. Their presence had hitherto attracted the notice neither of the French nor of the Sultan, and their removal now, or their consign ment to the Sultan’s care, might result in the Tribunal’s attention being drawn to our pre vious action. There might be some advantage in the retention of the Telegraph Island flag staff, as evidence that our right to reoccupy was *[ 6 ] not affected by any assertion of the Sultan’s sovereignty subsequent to original occupation. But the Government of India were of the opinion that the question might be discussed, after the declaration of the Award, with the Sultan. There did not seem to be any parallel between the possible revival of the British claim to Telegraph Island and the Bunder Gisseh incident. The former would resemble the revival of the claim to the station at Henjam. Since the issue of this telegram, it has come to notice that the erection of the flag- staffs has not escaped public attention, but has been mentioned in an article in the Al Ahram, dated the 21st June 1905. 22. Koweit and Nejd .—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf writes, on the 16th July 1905, that the question of a new flag for Koweit ships and of certificates to be granted to the nakodas of these ships has been discussed with Sheikh Mubarak, and submits, for the approval of the Government of India, specimen designs for the flag and forms of the certificates. The Secretary of State for India was informed, on 18th July 1905, that Sheikh Mubarak is agreeable to the establishment of a coal depot for the British India Steam Navigation Company at Koweit, hut Major Cox has suggested that a site on Bubiyan Island appears preferable from a political point of view. 23. A memorandum from Mr. Gaskin states that at Kassim the inhabitants appear satisfied with the behaviour of the Turks, among whose troops, however, desertions and the loss of arms are of frequent occurrence. At Koweit, owing to British interference in affairs, property has increased greatly in value. It is rumoured at Kassim that the Turks will depute an officer to investigate the revenue, and that the Dairat-es-Saniyeh intend to build a railway from Basrah via Zobeir to Pao. Zobeir is the centre of a large arms traffic. 24. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, reports, on 28th June, that the Turks are said to have reached Shehi, 30 miles south west of Boreyda, and are in great straits for want of money and supplies. 25. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran intimates that the Mushir-ed Howleh, in speak ing of the status in Persia of Koweit Arabs, has stated that the Sublime Porte regard all Koweitis as Ottoman subjects, and object to any interference on their behalf by any other Power. His Excellency has agreed to refer the matter, on our representation, to the Shah, and to issue orders to the Persian Customs and other officials to treat Koweitis less harshly. 26. The S. S. “ Lama ” has landed 6 cgse$ of arms and ammunition at Koweit,[ 7 ] 27. Proposals for the erection of suitable buildings for the Agency are now under con sideration. 28. Bahrein. —His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, reports that, under advice from him, | the “ Terbiet ”, a respectable Tehran journal, has contradicted a false and malicious version of the recent Bahrein incident published in the Calcutta “ Habl-ul-Matin ”, to the effect that it was a highhanded abuse of force by a strong power against a weak one, that troops had been landed at and had sacked Manama, and that this action foreshadowed a policy of violence by Great Britain against all the States on the shore of the Persian Gulf while Russia’s attention was absorbed by Ear Eastern matters. 29. Assistant Surgeon Ghulam Ali Khan has been despatched to Bahrein on plague duty. Plague is reported, on the 11th July 1905, by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to have ceased in Bahrein, and quarantine restric tions to have been removed. 30. Major Cox telegraphed, on the 15th July 1905, that two fresh piracies had been committed by Ahmed-bin-Selman on 25th and 26th June 1905. The report forwarded by the Political Agent at Bahrein shows the ineffectual efforts made by him to capture or trace the pirate. 31. As Major Cox has intimated on 17th July the readiness of Sheikh Ali to surrender, the question of the place of his detention is under consideration. 32. General .—The Secretary of State for India has been informed by despatch (29th June 1905), with reference to the alleged hindrances to British trade in the Turkish ports of the Persian Gulf, that on investigation no evidence was obtainable to indicate that foreign ships received preferential treatment. The quarantine regulations, however, were found to be unnecessarily strict and detri mental to British interests, and it was suggested that His Majesty’s Government might find it possible to secure some relaxation of the rules. Simla, 1 C. SOMERS COCKS. The 1st Aug. 1905. )of information received during the month of July 1905, regarding external affairs relating to the North- East Frontier, Burma, Siam, and China, [Notb.—T his memorandum is based upon reports, the accuracy of which it is not always possible to guarantee.] Memorandum TIBET. 1. With the approval of the Govern ment of India, Captain O’Connor has invited the Ti-llimpoche to send one or two promising boys to Gyantse with the object of having them instructed in European medical science. 2. See paragraph 4 of the Memorandum for April 1905. On the 11th June 1905, Cap tain O’Connor reported the receipt of inform ation from Lhasa to the effect that the Tsong- du (Assembly) have recently discussed the question of sending delegates to India, and are almost unanimously in favour of doing so, but fear to take any action without the express permission of the Dalai Lama. They have written to the Dalai Lama, asking leave to send some representative officials to India during the ensuing cold weather assuming, apparently, that the Viceroy’s invitation which they have declined once will still hold good. 3. See paragraph 2 of the Memorandum for June 1905. With a view to the preven tion of wire-cutting, Captain O’Connor has suggested that small monthly subsidies should be° paid to the headmen of each of the prin cipal villages along the road between Tang La and Gyantse, on the understanding that, should the wire be cut at any time, payment of the subsidy to the headman of the village within whose boundaries the cutting occurred will be withheld, and the Jongpen, accompanied by Captain O’Connor, will proceed to the spot, and award punishment to the persons found to be responsible. The Government of India have asked for further information with regard to the scheme. 4. A Japanese traveller named Mr. Teramoto, who is apparently in the employ of the Japanese Minister at Peking, and who has travelled from Peking, disguised as a Mongolian Lama, through Mongolia and Tibet, via Koko Nor, Lhasa, and Shigatse, called upon Captain O’Connor at Gyantse, and gave him interesting information. He reported that, while he was at Lhasa in the month of May, two Russians disguised as Mongolians, with* a following of Buriats, arrived there, and took up their quarters in the bazaar. They were followed, after a few days’ interval, by[ 2 ] nineteen and later by eighty camels, many of which were loaded with long boxes believed to contain rifles, and five hundred more camels were expected when he left Lhasa for Shigatse. Mr. Teramoto thought that the boxes probably contained rifles, because goods from Mongolia are nearly always packed in leather, and not in wood, and he had never seen wooden boxes of such a length brought from Mongolia before. Further, in the course of conversation with servants belonging to the lodging house in which the Russians stayed, he learnt that the packages were much heavier than those containing the usual imports from Mongolia, viz -&gt; c J oth » silk s, silver, &amp;c. A military officer named Ma, on the Amban’s staff in Lhasa, also told him that the officers were Russians, and that they were bringing rifles to Lhasa. On reaching Shigatse, Mr. Teramoto learnt from some Lhasa monks that about one thousand camels belonging to the same party had arrived at Lhasa, many of them carryin°* boxes of the same make and escorted by Euriats. While at Gyantse, Mr. Teramoto further heard from some of the monks of the mot ! aster y there that a large consignment of Russian rifles had been received at Lhasa. While at Lhasa, Mr. Teramoto went with a crowd of pilgrims to the Potala, on one of the holy days when such pilgrims go to obtain the blessing of the Dalai Lama, or, in his absence, the blessing of the Ti-Rimpoche. One of the palace attendants, thinking Mr. leramoto to be a Mongolian, called him aside iroin the crowd, and asked him if he had met the Dalai Lama in Mongolia. He replied that he had not, since he had come from Koko Nor whereas the Dalai Lama had gone via Tsaidam to Urga. Mr. Teramoto enquired what the -Dalai Lama meant to do in Mongolia, and the attendant said that he hoped to get assistance from the Russians. Mr. Teramoto sent two telegrams to the Japanese Minister at Peking during his stay in Gyantse and received replies to them. The Government of Bengal have been requested to suggest to Mr. Teramoto, on ins arrival in Calcutta or Darjeeling, that he s ould come up to Simla to interview the Government of India, who will defray the expenses connected with his visit. 5. See paragraph 6 of the Memo- randum for June 1905. The party sent by the Tashi Lama to ask the Dalai Lama to ^ eonsisted of the following two ,,W Th ? Tsecho Lingpa, an uncle (on the mother s side) of the Tashi Lama, who was formerly one of the lour Grand Secretaries ot Lhasa, but now holds the post of Kenchen which is an office of greater honour, but carrying less pay and responsibility than that of Grand Secretary.t 3 ] (ii) The head cup-hearer of the Tashi Lama, whose rank is equal with that of the Kenchen. The Japanese traveller referred to in the foregoing paragraph, in the course of a convers ation with Captain O’Connor, mentioned that the Emperor of China had written to the Dalai Lama, instructing him to proceed to Peking before returning to Lhasa, and that the Dalai Lama would probably leave Urga for Pekin'* in the autumn—about October or November 1905. 6. On the 24th May, Thakur Jai Chand, British Trade Agent at Gartok, wrote com plaining of the conduct of the Chabrang Dzongpon in delaying his letters. Mr. White was accordingly requested to bring the con duct of this official to the notice of the Lhasa Government with a view to preventing the recurrence of delays in the despatch of letters, and to represent to them that the Government of India take a very serious view of the matter, and will be prepared to insist on the removal of the Chabrang Dzongpon from his present post, should he give any further cause for complaint. Thakur Jai Chand having subse quently complained that the Garpons of Gartok also had adopted an obstructive attitude in regard to the transmission of his corre spondence, Mr. White has been further directed to request the Lhasa Government to send immediate instructions to these officials to arrange for the transmission of letters to and from the British Trade Agent. 7. See paragraph 3 of the Memorandum for June 1905. Prom a report received by the Assistant Political Officer in Chumbi it appears that the monks who killed the Amban belonged to the Cho-de monastery, close to the Batang jong. 8. See paragraph 5 of the Memorandum for June 1905. From the Yatung Trade Eeturns from 1st October 1904 to 30th June 1905, which have now been received, it is possible to review with fair accuracy the trade of the first year since the signature of the Lhasa Conven tion, the amount of trade during the months of July, August, and September being always very small. The imports from India to Tibet amount to Rs. 10,54,416 ; the exports to Rs. 6,73,253. Both these amounts are exclusive of treasure. The total of the two comes to Rs. 17,27,669. For July, August, and Septem ber another lakh may be added, since the trade is above the average this year, and this makes the value of the trade for the year, via Yatung, Rs. 18,28,000 roughly. To this must be added about Rs. 17 000 for trade via Gangtok, which has commenced this year with the opening of the Nathu La route. The total figure is, therefore, Rs. 18,45,000. This is higher than the figure of any other year, and[ 4 ] exceeds the average of the years 1899 to 1903, inclusive, by Rs. 3,34,000. The year 1904 has been excluded from this calculation, as trade was practically at a standstill during the first nine months of it. The export trade has been handi capped this year by want of transport. The military operations connected with the Tibet Mission last year caused many Tibetans living on or near the line of march to evacuate their cultivation. The line of march being the chief trade route from Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and the whole area from which the trade under review is drawn, the supply of fodder for ponies, mules, donkeys, and the other transport animals has been this year much below the average. Consequently the cost of transport has been high. It seems clear that the stock of wool in Lhasa, Shigatse, and other places is at present con siderably more than is usual at this time of the year. In these circumstances, it is probable that the exports next year will be larger than they have been this year. The imports contain greater value in pro portion to their bulk than the exports, the latter consisting chiefly of wool, the former of cotton and woollen manufactures. The transport difficulty has, therefore, affected imports in a much smaller degree, the only difference being that fewer animals have returned unladen from Kalimpong this year than was ^ the case in previous years. The effect of this may be seen in the large import this year and in the extent to which it has exceeded the export. It is unlikely that the imports next year will be much larger than they have been this year, since the demand for Indian goods in Central Tibet, though still strong, is not as strong as it was last October. Since, however, transport is likely to be cheaper and more plentiful, and since the profit on the trade between Kalimpong and Tibet has always been good, there may be a slight increase. 9. A Chinese official who has been sent from Lhasa to inspect the Chinese Post Houses along the road, called on the British Trade Agent at Gyantse on the 6th July. This official stated that troops are now being despatched from China to converge upon the Batan^ district from three different directions—from Sungpan and Chengtu in Ssuchuan, and also from Yunnan—to the number of 7,500 alto gether, and it is rumoured that, after reducing Batang to order, these troops will advance as far as Chamdo in Eastern Tibet. There are even rumours that they will come as far as Lhasa. He said that the road between Lhasa and la-tsien-lu is in a very disturbed state, and no Chinese officials can at present pass along it, but the Chinese post is allowed to pass as usual, with the exception thatI © ® \ [ 5 ] I i. yr r all letters are examined in the big monastery at Batang, and anything prejudicial to the interests of the people of Batang is destroyed. 10. Thakur Jai Chand, the British Trade Agent at G-artok, has been visiting the annual fair held at Dabazong, which commences about the middle of June and lasts up to the end of July. He reports that people of the Almora district and of Badrinath in the Garhwal district attend this fair, and have on this occasion brought the following articles from India for trade :— Coral, to the value of ... Rs. 750 Broadcloth, to the value of „ 300 Cotton-goods, to the value of „ 700 Total ... Rs. 1,750 He adds that 32 boxes of tea, valued at Rs. 1,920, have been received from Lhasa for sale, and that the traders from India have purchased wool, worth Rs. 931, and 1,762 kacha maunds of salt for export to India. The Agent intends visiting other fairs which are held at Gyanema and Grersa. The former lasts from the middle to the end of July, and the latter commences in August. Thakur Jai Chand intended reaching Gyanema in time to meet Mr. Sherring, the Deputy Commissioner of Almora, who was expected to arrive there about the 15th of July (see paragraph 1 of the Memorandum for June 1905). 11. Fide paragraph 1 of the Memoran dum for May 1905. On the 6th July 1905, the Minister at Peking telegraphed that the Chinese Commissioner had informed his Government that there was no prospect whatever of coming to any satisfactory conclusion with the Government of India in regard to the Tibet Treaty. The Chinese Government have represented to Sir E. Satow that outside comment may be provoked if the negotiations continue to drag on without result, and that such agitation would be dis advantageous to both countries, and have asked him for a suggestion as to the best course to pursue. They state that they are prepared to favour a transfer of the negotiations to London, in which case Tang Tachen, the Chinese Commissioner and Plenipotentiary, would be instructed to proceed thither, or to Peking, where the matter could be negotiated between the British Minister and Prince Ching. Sir E. Satow suggests that His Majesty’s Government might either take the line that, in default of the arrangement proposed by the Government of India, they would prefer to do without any agreement with China, or they might intimate that, if Prince Ching likes to resume his conver sation with the Minister at the point whereit was broken off last year, no objection would be raised. In the latter case Tang might remain where he is until the probable result of the communications between the Prince and the Minister became known. The attitude of the Chinese seems to the Govern ment of India to show signs of weakening, and it has been suggested to His Majesty’s Secre tary of State for India that, while adhering resolutely to the main position which has been taken up under the authority of His Majesty’s Government, it might be wise to provide means whereby China could yield without appearing to do so. Accordingly, His Majesty’s Govern ment have been advised to state detinitely that they are unable to agree to the transfer of the negotiations either to Peking or London, and that they would prefer to dispense with the Agreement with China in default of the arrangement proposed by the Government of India, but that, as it is now clear that Tang’s acceptance depends upon orders from Peking, we should welcome Sir E. Satow’s intervention there, not for the purpose of discussing any modification of our terms or as an alternative arrangement, but with a view to his applying pressure or persuasion to Prince Ching to instruct Tang to accept the terms offered. 12. The British Trade Agent at Gyantse reports that he received a letter from the Ti- Rimpoche on the 21st June, containing a number of complaints, regarding our action in Chumbi, in various matters, such as the collec tion of revenue, &amp;c., and saying that, if the Phari and Chumbi peasants are not allowed to furnish free transport, &amp;c., to Tibetan and Chinese officials as heretofore, the friendship between the two countries will be in danger. In reply, Captain O’Connor has informed the Ti-Rimpoche that as under the terms of the Lhasa Convention the Chumbi valley is to remain in British occupation for a term of three years, the Indian Government can not recognise the right of the Tibetan Govern ment to raise any questions, regarding our proceedings in the Chumbi valley during that period. He has been asked to submit a copy of the correspondence to the Government of India. 13. On the 28th July, Captain O’Con nor telegraphed that he had received a letter from the Lhasa Government couched in strong and almost threatening terms, reiterating their complaints regarding our action in the Chumbi valley. The Lhasa authorities aver that General Macdonald promised the Phan Jongpens that they would be allowed to exercise full powers during our occupation of the Chumbi valley as before, and they re proach the Government of India with a breach of faith likely to interrupt friendly relations. The Tibetans further complain of the telegraph line to Gyantse, and demand its[ 7 ] removal. Finally, they state that, if the above causes of difference are not adjusted satisfac torily, disturbances may follow. Captain O’Connor is forwarding the full text of the Tibetan letter by post, and in the mean while his telegram has been repeated to His Majesty’s Government, with the remark that the Government of India will submit very shortly, for approval, the draft of the reply which they propose to send. BHUTAN. 14. See paragraph 10 of the Memoran dum for May 1905. Mr. White’s mission returned to Gangtok on the afternoon of the 19th June. The direct object of the Mission was to present the Insignia of the K.C.I.E. to the Tongsa Penlop at Punakha, but it was sub sequently considered to be desirable that Mr. White should continue his journey to Tongsa, in order that he might have an opportunity of establishing thoroughly friendly relations with the Tongsa Penlop and other Bhutanese officials, and of learning as much as possible about the geography of the country. He ultimately emerged into Tibet from Tashicho Jong, via Lingzi Jong and Hram, a route never before traversed by Europeans. During the course of the Mission Mr. White was able to secure geographical information of considerable value, he investigated the possibility of improving the communications between Bengal and Bhutan, and discussed with the Bhutanese Council a variety of questions connected with the maintenance of order on the frontier. His conduct of the duties entrusted to him was marked by dis cretion and success, and has elicited the cordial approbation of the Government of India. 15. (Fide paragraph 11 of the Memo randum for May 1905.) From a report received during the month it appears that the present Deb Raja, as Cholay Tulku, is not only the Deb Raja by election, but the re presentative on earth of the Shabam-Rimpoche (as Dharma Raja) by reason of his being the present incarnation of the “ voice ” of the first Shabam, and that he thus combines in his own person the headship of the religious and secular Governments of Bhutan. Sir Ugyen Wang Chuk, K.C.I.E., Tongsa Penlop, has been made Prime Minister; and, as such, has been entrusted with the State seal. All the higher officers are either his relatives, connections, or dependents. CHINA. • 16. The Government of Burma forwarded a report on the 3rd July 1905, regarding the travels of Eieutenant Grillieres and another[ 8 ] in the Province of Yunnan. Lieutenant Grillieres had resumed his travels and the Superintendent and Political Officer at Thaunggyi recently reported that Lieutenant Grillieres had marched without escort from Chiengmai via Mong Hang and Mong Hsat to Keng Lap en route to Mong Sing, thus passing through the British Shan States of Mong Pan and Kengtung. The Lieutenant did not obtain any previous permission from any British official. The Lieutenant-Governor of Burma pro posed to inform the Superintendent at Taunggyi, who had asked him for instructions in respect of future cases, that there is no objection to the journeys of properly accredited Trench travellers in the Shan States, and that he may give permission for such journeys, reporting the circumstances to the Local Government, although it would not, of course, he expedient to permit journeys through or towards the Wa States, or in other localities, where untoward incidents might occur. 17. Under existing orders, which were issued in 1903, French officials travelling on transfer are permitted, under certain condi tions, to traverse British territory by a road running from Hsop-huok through Mong Lin and Namlo to Keng Lap. In reply to their present letter, the Government of Burma have been informed that the Government of India have no objection to the existing orders being extended so as to include duly accredited French travellers, sS well as officials, and that the orders may he held to refer to other routes than the one described above; but that it would be inexpedient that per mission for French travellers to make journeys in the Shan States should be granted in the general terms suggested by the Government of Burma, and the intention of the present orders must be preserved by limiting the entry of travellers to those who are bond fide passing through the Shan States en route to French or foreign territory, and are unaccompanied by an escort. 18. With reference to paragraph 9 of the Memorandum for June 1905, the Govern ment of Burma telegraphed, on the 12th July 1905, that the Taotai Shih was to leave Ten- gyueh on the 16th July probably via Yunnan city, that the new Taotai had taken charge on the 6th idem, and that Mr. Litton had ceased to discuss the frontier question with Taotai Shih when his transfer became inevitable. This telegram was repeated to the Secretary of State in answer to his telegram of the 24th June 1905. The Government of Burma have for warded a further .report from Mr. Litton onthe subject of the examination of the Burma- Ohina Boundary north of latitude 25° 35'. The reports are at present under consideration. 19. Mr. Litton, the Consul at Ten^yueh, reports that Mr. Lilley, the Engineer selected for the survey of the proposed line from Bhamo to Tengyueh, has made a reconnaissance as far as Tengyueh, and that his Assistants have been occupied in making a detailed survey between Bhamo and the Chinese frontier. Mr. Lilley’s report is expected shortly. 20. The British Consul-General at Yunnan Eu has forwarded a report to the Minister at Peking, regarding the Chinese Shan States bordering on the province of Burma. The young Chief of Kangai (Chinese Shan State), who is in Burma, refuses to return to Kangai on the ground that, if he does so, he will be persecuted by the Chinese officials, as soon as Mr. Litton, the Consul, leaves Tengyueh. The Government of Burma consulted the British Consul at Tengyueh by wire, with regard to the Sawhwa of Kangai. Mr. Litton proposed to invite Taotai Shih to call on the Kangai Sawbwa to return to his State, and suggested that he should be given an assurance of complete protection. Meanwhile, he requested the Consul-General at Yunnan to ask the Governor-General to instruct the Taotai by telegraph to protect against extortion and oppression, not the Kangai Sawhwa only, but all well conducted Shan Sawbwas in his jurisdiction. Mr. Wilkinson represented the matter to the Governor-General at Yunnan, and the latter replied formally that he was giving the necessary instructions to Taotai Shih. 21. The Government of Burma report the appointment of a British Customs officer at Ssumao in South Yunnan near the frontier of Burma. 22. With reference to paragraph 10 of the Memorandum for June 1905, regarding the Burma-China boundary between the Nam Ting and the Nalawt, the Government of Burma have reported that the Chinese have made certain encroachments, and have even established posts within the provisional boundary laid down by Mr. Scott. The Gov ernment of Burma have asked for orders as to the manner in which supervision should be exercised over the provincial boundary. The matter is receiving the consideration of the Government of India. 23. The Chinese Mission to India to study tea and opium culture referred to in paragraph 15 of the Memorandum for April 1905 reported its arrival at Ceylon on the 20th May and left Ceylon for India on the 21st July 1905.[ 10 ] SIAM. 24. With reference to paragraph 14 of the Memorandum for June 1905, Mr. Lloyd, an officer of the Bengal Forest Service, has been selected for the appointment of Conservator of Forests, Siam. The British Minister at Bang kok was informed accordingly, and he has re quested that Mr. Lloyd may be directed to proceed to Bangkok to interview the Siamese Minister. Orders are being issued accordingly. 25. The Government of Siam have asked to he supplied witli smooth-bore Snider carbines with buck-shot ammunition for the purpose of rearming their police.

The object which the Government of India desire to attain, as stated in their Secret letters in the Foreign Department of the 23rd October 1902, No. 192, and the 21st Tannery 1904. No. 16, is to prevent any Foreign Power establishing a commanding position at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are in entire agree ment with your Excellency as to the necessity of preventing any such action on the part of a Foreign Power, the first result of which would be to entail an increase of naval expenditure and a re-arrangement of our naval dispositions. It only remains, therefore, to consider the best means of securing this object. 3. The method which the Government of India have desired to adopt, viz., to hoist the British flag at certain points in the immediate vicinity of Cape Musandim, is open to the objection that it would not confer upon us any special rights in the places selected, unless it were accom panied by a specific proclamation of protectorate or annexation. On the other hand, an open assertion of our claims to these places might excite the jealousy of other Powers, and give rise to political complications. 4. The alternative method would be to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate the occupation by any within your Excellency’s recollection that on the 5th May 1903 Lord Lansdowne stated in the House of Lords that “ we should regard the “ establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian “ Gulf by any other Power as a very great menace to British interests, “ and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” Persian Gulf: hoisting the British F Musandim, fyc.

(5. The opinion of His Majesty’s Gavernment with regard to the flagstaff on Telegraph Island was based on the conclusion, formulated in the Secret Letter from your Excellency’s Government, No. 192, of the 23rd October 1902, that the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Muscat over the Makhlab Isthmus and Musandim Promontory was of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it would be open to His Majesty’s Government to ignore it. 7. The position has, however, been materially altered by Mr. Lorimer’s enquiries, the result of which is reported in his note of the 22nd March last; and I gather from your Excellency’s telegrams of the 27th March and 15th April last that the Government of India are no longer prepared to ignore the fact of the Sultan’s sovereignty over Musandim. 8.

As the Union Jack, when hoisted on shore, is generally held to denote British domination, and as tneir Lordships understand that it is desired to avoid any suggestion of territorial acquisition, they are of opinion that it would be best to use the differentiated Blue Ensign which it is understood is flown at the Telegraph Stations in and about the Persian Gulf.

It is therein laid down that the flagstaffs on Sheep Island and the isthmus between Ivlalcolm and Elphinstone Inlets suall be abandoned, and that it will be sufficient to main tain the flagstaff upon Telegraph Island, furtner that one of His Majesty's Slips shall occasionally visit that Island in order to see that the flagstaff is maintained and the flag hoisted.

With reference to paragraph 2 thereof I beg to say that I am at one with the view expressed by the Government of India to the effect that it would not be advisable to place the flagstaffs in charge of the Wali of Khasab for the reasons stated; and that in my opinion the best plan would be' for iIB to ask the Shihooh headman to recommend individuals of their tribe residing permanently in the villages .respectively nearest the 3 flagstaffs who would receive^ a regular stipend payable quarterly or half-yearly to Agents whom they might appoint at Shargah or one of the Pirate Coast Ports to receive it from the hands of the Residency Agent. The payment could in this way be made less noticeable than it could be at Bunder Abbas or Lingah, where it might give rise to gossip.

The Admiralty view was that it was unlikely that any foreign Power would take this action; but thau if this were to happen, increased naval expenditure and a rearrangement of our naval dispositions would be entailed. He stated that there were practically two alternatives, viz.:- (a..) To maintain the flagstaffs already erected, or (b.) To make it clear to other Powers that we snould not tolerate the occupation of any port or territory in the Persian Gulf. As regards (a), it was agreed that the maintenance of flag- staffs or the hoisting of the flag upon them did not confer any special rights unless accompaiiied by a specific proclamation of a Protectorate or of annexation. The hoisting of the flag u might, however, excite the jealousy of other Powers, and give rise to political complications.

My Lords Commissioners of tne Adiidraity iiavia g had before them your letter of the 7th ultimo on the subject of the Flags proposed to be hoisted in tiie neighbourhood of Cape Musandim, desire me to request you will represent to Mr Secretary Brodrick that the question of acquiring Naval Bases and Telegraph Stations on either side of tne entrance to the Persian Gulf came to the fore in February 1900, when the method of meeting possible Russian aggression in those waters came under the consideration of His Majesty's Government. 6 i.Cl* 1 '’) 2. as regards tne harbours on the Musandim promontory, tne means by which they were to oe prevented falling into the hands of other European Powers occupied considerable correspondence in 1900-1-2. It nad long been the policy to regard the territory as being under tne sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat, but the establishment of a rival influence by the French at Muscat, made it questionable whether it would not be expedient to treat the territory as independent,- the very shadowy authority possessed by the Sultan over the district rendering it feasible either to support or ignore his rights, as might seem most advantageous. lu The Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, S. W. In the Secret Letter of the 2drd October 1902 to wnich(i) J ,0 chich you refer, the Government of India, while not recommending any alteration in the native territorial conditions, proposed that the old telegraph buildings in Elphlnstone Inlet should be re-occupied by a Native Agent in charge of a British Flag, and that the strip of coast between Khor Kalba and Dioba should be recognised as part of the territory of the Chief of Shargah. To this proposal, which was referred to the Admiralty in a letter from the Foreign Office dated B9th November 1902, My Lords replied that they had no objection. To that arrangement, and to the method of carrying it out, they still adhere. 4.- Much correspondence followed in Reference to the selection of suitable Naval Bases, Coaling Stations, and Telegraph Stations, at the entrance of the Gulf, and on the 26th February 1904 a letter was received from your Depart ment enclosing copy of a Secret letter from the Government of India, dated 21st January 1904, in which those subjects were discussed, and in which at paragraph 5 a suggestion was made that the best way to effect the already authorised re-occupation of the old Telegraph Station in Elphinstone Inlet would be by erecting a Flagstaff on the isthmus * dividing Elphinstone and Malcolm Inlets, as well as upon Telegraph Island. 6.- While, however, in the covering letter from your Department dated 24th February 1904, tne enclosure above- mentioned is forwarded for the consideration of their Lordships on the subject of -(i) The selection of suitable Naval Bises at the entrance to the Persian Gulf; and (ii) The choice of a landing place for the proposed telegraph cable; the only point of the letter on which their Lordships' views were requested, ap :ears to be contained in the latter part of the second paragraph, in which Mr Brodrick hopes that the Admiralty will see their way to support the claim of the Government of India that the whole cost of the J proposal to re-establish a British Telegraph Station should not be borne by Indian Revenues. It was in this sense that the letter was taken, and replied to. 6. - The letter of the 8th August 1904 from the India Office, was the first categorical intimation received by My Lords of any contemplated extension of the original plan of re-occupying Telegraph Island, by erecting Flagstaffs on the Maklab isthmus and on Sheep Island, but this letter merely enclosed a copy of a letter which had been addressed to the Foreign Office asking Lord Lansdowne's opinion whether there was any objection to authority being given to the Government of India to erVect the Flagstaffs. 7. - My Lords cannot admit that the fact of their having offered no objection to the proposal to re-occupy Telegraph Island by placing there a Native Agent in charge of a British Flag, can be held to cover their unsolicited acquiescence in the proposed further distribution of Flagstaffs in the District, one being on the mainland.8.- The original proposal, on which they were directly consulted, was simply a case of reverting to a state of things which had previously existed without question; to the renewal of which there was a reasonable answer in the event of objections being raised by European Powers, and in which there could be no question of territorial expansion, as the so-called island is nothing but a rock. As regards the other Flagstaffs, it is a very different matter, and My Lords, when appealed to by your Department at the instance of the Foreign Office, as to the Flags to be flown, felt, as already stated in Admiralty Letter (M-01705) of the 2brd December 1904, that if the flag was not intended to denote British territorial expansion, it not only meant nothing, but was a possible source of international complication. That My Lords did not take an earlier opportunity of bringing these considerations to Mr Brodrick t s notice is because they had never been directly consulted on the political aspect of the question. Tne matter is one which is only likely to affect His Majesty’s Navy in certain contingencies, and they assumed that the hoisting of the Flags was the result of a policy already decided on between the Foreign Office, India Office, and the Government of India, and that had their views on the subject been required they would have been asked for them definitely.L.P.-No. -o In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote M - 01816 and address letter to— The Secretary, Admiralty, Whitehall, London, S.W. .2 5~/3 - Confidential - 'cEiygo^'- *t - 9JmNI905 AC DEP&amp;- Vj\ • £ ^ Admiralty, 6th January 190^ .

Consul at Muscat to erect the flagstaffs at Mu^enden in accordance with the wishes of the Indian Government. He also asked me to convoy Lieutenant Shake spear to Bander Abbas to take over his political duties there and to take him on to Mussonden to bo present when the Flagstaffs were put up. Major Grey e^lained that as trie Government of India had decided that no reference was to be made to the Siltan of Muscat, that lie (Major Grey) had represented to the Government of Intia that it would be better that he should have nothing to do with the matter, and that his place should bo taken by Lieutenant Shake spear within whose political sphere Mussenden would lie. In this the Government of India assented. 2.- I accordingly loft the same day, landed Lieutenant Shake spear at Bander Abbas on the 20th and embarking him again, arrived at Elpiiinstone Inlet next morning. 8.- The Flagstaffs were erected at - Elphinstone Inlet Telegraph Island Al Ghanam Island. For convenience of reference I propose to call them Flag- staffs0 Plagataffs A., B m C. f in tfto above order. Plag^taff A is erected at the Eastern end of the isthmus between Khor ash Shen (KipMnstone Inlet) and Xubhat Gliazira (Malcolm Inlet). It is situated on a ridge about 250 feet high overlooking both inlets. Further to the west along the Isthmus the cliffs are high and precipitous, and in our opinion the sight chosen was the best possible, as it is comparatively easy of access. Flagstaff B is on tele graph island close to the plinth of the old telegraph buildings. Flagstaff C is in a sandy cove a few hundred yards north of the S. E. corner of Ulianam Island. It is quite screened from view from outside. Anywhere on tho hills it could bo visible from seaward and this also applies to the sandy beach under Pier Point. A and B wore put up 21st November, and C on 22nd November. 4. - All the Flagstaffs wore red-loaded, freshly painted white and fitted with cross-yards, trucks and halyards. The Telegraph poles so fitted make excellent Flagstaffs. 5. - On the way b^aok wo visit ed the Su ltan of Muscat’s Vali at Khasab and the Headman of Kumzar village, out owing to the decision of the Government of India referred to in paragra h 1 we did not consider it proper to mako any reference to the Flagstaffs. I do not think tnoro is much danger of their being interfdrod with but it would bo well, if definite arrangements could be made as soon as * possible. 7.- I would suggest that if possible the Vali of Khasab should be put in charge of all three, but if we employ our&amp; our ovm Ajents it would bo convoniont if tho Uuardiauo of A and B resided at Kliasab f and of C at Kuiozar. 8*- Lieutenant Shakospear disembarked at Bandor Abbas BBrd November, and I arrived at llusoat tne next day* 9.- I would respectfully suggest tdat as iilphimtono Inlet is a fine liar hour.' tiiat a sketch survey should be made of the place on a sufficiently largo scale.

As I shall subsequently have to explain the position of affairs to His Highness the Saltan, it evidently is better, having regard to our future relations that I should not be connected with the erection of the flag-staffs if it can con veniently be avoided. I therefore took the opportunity to hand over the matter to Lieutenant Shakespear after thoroughly explaining to him what had to be done. H. M. S. Sphinx left on Friday last for Bunder Abbas and Mussandim to erect the flag-staffs, as stated in my telegram referred to above. The blue ensigns which arrived here yesterday I will send to Lieutenant Shakespear at Bunder Abbas by next mail, pointing out to him the necessity of awaiting telegraphic instructions regarding the flag ultimately selected before acting further. 3.

Kemp, Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, To— Rear-Admiral Georoe L. Atkinson-Willes, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. I have the honour to report that on 18th November, I received a request from His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat to erect the flag-staffs at Mussan- dim in accordance with the wishes of the Indian Government. He also nsked me to convey Lieutenant Shakespear to Bunder Abbas to take over his political duties there, and to take him on to Mussandim to be present when the flag- staffs were put up. Major Grey explained that as the Government of India had decided that no reference was to be made to the Sultan of Muscat, that he (Major Grey) had represented to the Government of India that it would be better that he should have nothing to do with the matter, and that his place should be taken by Lieutenant Shakespear within whose political sphere Mus sandim would lie. In this the Government of India assented. 2. I accordingly left the same day, landed Lieutenant Shakespear at Bunder Abb is on the 20th and embarking him again, arrived at Elphinstone Inlet next morning. 3. The flag-staffs were erected at— Elphinstone Inlet, Telegraph Island, A1 Ghanam Island. Eor convenience of reference I propose to call them flag-staffs A., B., C., in the above order. Elag-staff A is erected at the eastern end of the isthmus between Khor-ash-Shen (Elphinstone Inlet) and Kubhat Ghazira (Malcolm Inlet). It is situated on a ridge about 250 feet high overlooking both inlets. Further to the west along the isthmus the cliffs are high and pre cipitous, and in our opinion the site chosen was the best possible, as it is compar atively easy of access. Flag-staff B is on telegraph island close to the plinth of the old telegraph buildings. Flag-staff C is in a sandy cove a few hundred yards north of the south-eastern corner of Ghanam Island. It is quite screened from view from outside. Anywhere on the hills it could be visible from seaward and this also applies to the sandy beach under Pier Point. A and B were put up November 21st, and C on November 22nd. 4. All the flag-staffs were redloaded, freshly painted white and fitted with cross yards, trucks and halyards. The telegraph poles so fitted make excellent flag-staffs. 5. On the way back we visited the Sultan of Muscat’s Vali at Khasab and the head man of Kumzar village, but owing to the decision of the Government of India referred to in paragraph l* we did not consider it proper to make any reference to the flag-staffs. I do not think there is much danger of their being interfered with, but it would be well, if definite arrangements could be made as soon as possible. 7. I would sugsrest that if possible the Vali of Khasab should be put in charge of all three, but if we e nploy our own agents it would be convenient if the guardians of A and B resided at Khasab, and of C at Kumzar. 8. Lieutenant Shakespear disembarked at Bunder Abbas, November 23rd and I arrived at Muscat the next day. 9. I would respectfully suggest that as Elphinstone Inlet is a fine harbour, that a sketch survey should be marie of the place on a sufficiently large scale. Sphinx and R ’dbi'e/st could do this when opportunity offered. Bunder Abbas is convenient for mails and Henjam for telegrams. G. I. C. P. 0.—No. 2879 P. D.-14-12-1904.-60.—T. W. L.(Confidential.) From — Captain A. P. Trevor, I.A., for Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department No. 3911-E.B., dated 17th November 1904, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a report and notes by Lieutenant W. H. Shakespear, on the subject of the erection of flagstaffs on the Mussandum Peninsula. 2. I presume that Captain Kemp, lately Senior Naval Officer in Persian Gulf, to whom the operation was entrusted, has already submitted a report to Government on the subject through the naval authorities. No. 374, dated the 24th November 1904 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear, Assistant Resident and Acting British Consul, Bunder Abbas, To— Major P. Z. Coz, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to address you in connection with the erection of flagstaffs on certain portions of the Mussandum Peninsula, and would refer you to letter No. 521, dated 25th October, addressed to you by the Political Agent, Muskat. On my way to join my appointment as Assistant Resident and His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas, I stopped at Muskat; and, as the Mussandum Peninsula has lately been placed within the jurisdiction of the Assistant Resident here, I discussed the erection of these flagstaffs with Major Grey. As the flagstaffs had not up to that time been erected, Major Grey and I agreed that the best course would be for him to hand over the correspondence on the subject to me, and that I should accompany Commander Kemp on board His Majesty’s ship Sphinx in carrying out Government’s wishes in the matter. Accordingly, on the 20th November 1904,1 proceeded in His Majesty’s ship Sphinx to Elphinstone Inlet, arriving there on the 21st instant. Flagstaffs were erected on Telegraph Island, and on the isthmus between Elphinstone and Malcolm Inlets. The Chief of Sibi village (that nearest to the flagstaffs) was also interviewed. On the 22nd instant, His Majesty’s ship Sphinx left the 1 inlet and Commander Kemp and I landed at Khasab, where we were met by and interviewed the Wali of the Sultan of Muskat, the Sheikh of the town bein' also present. Proceeding to Sheep Island, the third flagstaff was erected there and the Sheikh of Kumzar interviewed. I attach a sketch of the peninsula and inlets showing the exact positions of the flagstaffs, together with copies of notes made of conversations and on the positions of the flagstaffs. The notes sufficiently explain the state of affairs existing on the spot; and I would here respectfully submit that there seems little doubt that all the inhabitants of the peninsula do regard themselves as the subjects of Sultan Say id Feysul. It was not considered advisable to hoist any flags, the only ones available being Union Jacks, which I understand Government have rejected in favour of blue ensigns. The flagstaffs were erected without any ostentation ajidjn___ places which a re not visible to passing vessels from the open sea, but at the same time I think they fulfil the object desired. A copy of this letter and of the notes is being forwarded direct to the Political Agent, Muskat, for his information, as the matter may require his urgent attention.3 Note on conversation with the Chief of Sibi Village, Elphinsfone Inlet. The party to erect the flagstaff on Telegraph Island having been landed, Sphinx proceeded further up to the head of Elphinstone Inlet. Fishing boats from the village of Sibi came off to the ship, and the Chief, Mohamed bin Abdullah, together with his half-brother Abdullah bin Hames, were invited aboard for a talk. At the interview, Commander Kemp and the two Arabs being present, it appeared that the people of Sibi claim to be independent!! though it is difficult to understand how far such is really the case as the Chief admitted I that he played off the Sheikhs of Khasab and Kamzar each against the other, according to whichever of them happened to be harrying his people or village; \ no mention was made of the Sultan, Sayid FeysuL The heat is so severe that \ residence at tSibi in The summer months is impossible, the inhabitants therefore all migrate to the Oman Coast, principally to Karsha and Dibba Bay for the hot weather. The people are exceedingly poor, living by fishing fiom which they make so little that there is no export. There is no overland route from Sibi to anywhere owing to the extremely rugged country and the people therefore migrate in their boats. The Chief was quite willing to look after the flagstaffs, but said he could \ not be responsible if the Sheikhs of Khasab and Kamzar interfered with them. After erection of flagstaffs in Elphinstone Inlet on 21st November 1904, Sphinx left on 22nd and steamed into Khasab Bay where Commander Kemp and I landed. We were met by the Sheikh of the town, Suliman bin Malik, and the W'ali (Khalid bin Thani) of the Sultan of Muskat. The Wall had two guns fired presumably as a salute, and conducted us to his house. In conversation, &lt; during whole of which the Sheikh was also present, he (the Wali) said that he | had been Wali of Khasab for the last 15 years and had jurisdiction over the ] whole of the inlets and islands up to Mussandum. That the Sheikh of The Sheikh of Khasab acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sultan and said that owing to an old feud his people and those of Kamzar were not on the best of terms and that the Wali settled their disputes. The Sultan himself had not visited this district for many years, the last occasion being 17 years ago when he accompanied his father Sayed Turki. After the usual sherbet and coffee, the interview closed. Under the circumstances any mention of the flagstaffs was thought undesirable. # After stopping to drop a party with the flagstaff for Sheep Island, Sphinx proceeded to Kamzar, where Commander Kemp and I landed. We were met by This was necessary owing to the severity of the heat which made Kamzar impossible for summer residence. Some of his people migrated further south to the Oman coast. The people lived entirely by fishing and had a small trade with Koweit and Basrah in dried and salted fish. Again it was thought undesirable to mention the flagstaffs. No inland route from this bay. Please refer to sketch in which the exact positions of the flagstaffs are marked by red crosses and numbered 1, 2, 3. The flagstaffs are iron tubular telegraph posts about 38 feet high, fitted with wooden yards and signal halyards and have been securely put up. Flagstaff on Telegraph Island (No. 1) is only visible when a vessel has sailed some considerable distance up the inlet. The foundations of the old Kamzar was also subject to the Sultan and acteduaj*-bis Wali at that place. Note on conversation with the Sheikh of Karazar. the Sheikh, Kali mat bin Mahdi, and conducted to his house. A short conversation ensued in which he said he was under the jurisdiction of the Wali of Khasab, and that during the hot weather some of his people migrated to that place. Note on positions of flagstaffs at Elphinstone Inlet and Sheep Island.telegraph buildings are still existing and the staff was erected in the centre of the old house plinth. Flagstaff on isthmus (No. 2) was erected on the lowest part of the ridge between Elphinstone and Malcolm Inlets called Maklab. It is about 200 feet above the s^ level and overlooks both the northern hays of Malcolm Inlet. The open sea was not visible from this point neither east nor west. Flagstaff on Sheep Island (No. 3) was erected on the eastern shore of the island in a small bay. It is only visible from the strait, it being considered inadvisable to erect the staff on a height where it would have been plainly visible from the open sea, as I understand Government does not desire that these flagstaffs should be too prominent. Arrangements for the hoisting of flags will be difficult to make. The whole of the country is uninhabited with the exception of a few very small bays here and there in which small villages exist, whose entire population is absent during the hot weather. Hoisting of the flags daily is absolutely impossible, they might be left hoisted day and night but would in that case be blown to rags in a very short time. It would, I think, be possible to arrange with the Sheikhs of Khasab and Kamzar to take charge of the flags and hoist them periodically, but this arrangement would probably only be possible in the cold weather and then only by previous agreement with the Sultan or his Wali at Khasab. If it is considered advisable that our own people should hoist the flags, a native might, perhaps, be found who would have to receive a salary for the purpose and made to live at Khasab whence he could make periodical journeys, but in this case it might be necessary to provide him with a boat.- Copy ) ^he leputy Secretary to the Government of India To tejor P. z.

Before preferring their views on this subject my Lords desire me to request you will represent to Mr.Secretary Brodrick that they would be glad to have more precise information as to what the erection of the flagstaffs at the places indicated in your letter under reply, and the proposed hoisting of a British Flag on the flagstaffs, are intended to denote. They assume from your previous communications on the subject that the decision to take this action is the result of correspondence between the Foreign Office, India Office and the Government of India, and they note that in tte memorandum from the Foreign Department at Simla, No.8493 E.B. of the 16th October 1904, the reason advanced for the decision, so far as the Government of India is concerned, is given in the following words 'The main object of the erection of these flagstaffs 'is to prevent the occupation of any of the sites 'by a foreign power, but the measure is to be Secretary of State, 'considered INDIA OFFICE.“considered as having been undertaken in connection “with our former telegraph stations, and with possible developments of our system of telegraphic communications in the Gulf ftc, 11 — | My Lords gather that there is no intention on the part of His Majesty^ Government to proclaim the places mentioned as British territory f and this being so, the act of erecting flagstaffs and hoisting a British Flag, appears to them to lose its significance. The mere fact of hoisting a British Flag in a given position (whether such flag is the Union Jack or the Blue Ensign does not appear to My Lords to be material) would not prevent the joint occupation of the site by a foreign nation, if that foreign nation chose to erect a flag staff and hoist a flag, alongside. Or again, should hostile comment by civilised powers be roused, the possibility of which is apparently recognised. Great Britain might find herself forced to defend the flag from insult, in a position where the Flag, In default of indicating British Territory, was practically meaningless. Thus a crisis might be precipitated, which, so far as British Interests are concerned, would be based on wholly insuf ficient ground s • The policy which has dictated the earmarking of these places, has been formulated without any reference to Admiralty opinion; My Lords have never been consulted in the matter, and they have refrained from offering suggestions unasked; but as in the event of any unfortunate complications arising, it is the Navy who woufcd be called upon to defend the honour of the Flag, they avail themselves of the opportuni ty afforded them by the request for their views on the descript-ion of Flag to be hoisted* to place these considerations before Mr Brodrick. It appears to my Lords that unless it is desired to proclaim the sites to be British Territory* a policy which they do not wish to be considered as advocating* the flags should not be hoisted* I am* Sir* Tour obedient Servant,/a MINUTE BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEEOY. This is one of the most difficult questions with which I have been called upon to deal. The rival considerations, whether they relate to the elucidation of political facts, or to the determination of a course of action based partly upon political, partly upon strategical, considerations are so evenly balanced that one may well hesitate to decide between them. Moreover, the political future, against which our action, whatever form it may take, is intended as a safeguard, is itself so shrouded in obscurity and so little admits of confident forecast that it is exceedingly difficult to adjust the means that we are now called upon to adopt to the end that we have in view. t I hat end may be described both in a negative and in a positive aspect. Negatively we desire to exclude from the Musandim promontory in particular, and from the Batineh coast in general, the ships or forces of any foreign Power! Now the only foreign Powers who require at present to be considered in such a context are Prance and Russia. Either Power might in time of trouble desire to take possession of a port or coaling station at some point of this projection on the Arabian coast. Still more might they contemplate such a proceeding, if we had been driven by Russian action or Russian intrigue to occupy the islands on the opposite or northern shore of the Persian Gulf—ws., Hormuz, Kishm and Henjam. The same reasons that render it so important for Spain (having lost Gibraltar) to retain Ceuta, and that would drive the European Powers into a ferment, if, in addition to the possession of Gibraltar, we were to occupy either Ceuta or Tangier, will—on the more extended sphere of action of the Persian Gulf—tempt our rivals, in the event of our seizing one side of the gateway, to plant themselves upon the other. If it be objected that neither Prance nor Russia is at all likely to take up a position in so isolated a situation, where they would possess neither hinterland nor communication with any interior base, I think that Gibraltar again supplies the answer. If a port or harbour is occupied for purely naval, and strategical purposes, political considerations are waived. This is exactly what we ourselves did in the case of Wei-Hai-Wei. Requiring the place solely for the above-named reasons, we hastened to Germany (who had never consulted us about Kiao Chau) and pledged ourselves not to push into the interior nor to build a railway. It is clear therefore that isolated naval bases are not uncommonly acquired without reference to land communications. Experience, however, shows that the base once occupied, territorial acquisition tends to follow. Thus the seizure of Aden has gradually been followed by the extension of a Protectorate over the hinter land, that now stretches inland for a breadth of 90 miles. Similarly the possession of Singapore has been followed not only by the absorption of the island but of all the adjacent States on the Malay Peninsula; and the occupa tion of Hong Kong has led to the gradual acquisition of a big slice of Kowloon. Should the Prench or the Russians therefore ever desire, on grounds of policy or strategy, to establish themselves on the Musandim peninsula or in its neighbourhood, I do not think that the remoteness or detachment of the situation would deter them from the step. Neither do I think that they would be deterred by the climate. Bunder Abbas is now represented as one of the most detestable places on the face of the globe. But that did not prevent Ormuz, which is separated from it only by a few miles, from becoming the seat of Portuguese sovereignty, and one of the greatest emporia of Asiatic trade. Besides, the occupation of a naval base does not necessarily involve a large permanent European garrison, or colonisation on a large scale. Even if the occupation were temporary only, and were under taken for the purposes of a particular campaign, with no intention of being ultimately persevered in, it might not, on that account, be less disagreeable or less dangerous to us. ,Supposing therefore that at a time of crisis Prance and Russia in comb in/ ation, or either Power singly, contemplate seizing a harbour on that part of the Arabian coast, what is there (apart from the risk of hostilities with Great Britain) to detei them ? The ascendency of JVIaskat over the littoral in cpiestion is so indeterminate that our own officer, Major Cox, advises us that we can either recognise or ignore it as we please. There is therefore no question of established or admitted right of sovereignty, to which we could appeal. Even if we our selves -were now to recognise the authority of the Sultan over those regions and to induce him to take steps to assert it, the trench Government w 7 ould not hold itself hound by our act. If it is open to Major Cox to urge the independence of Musandim, equally would it be open to the Prench. Their admission that the Anglo-1 renck lieclaration of 18G2 debars either Power from acquiring', either by lease or by cession, any part of Maskat territory, would not be held by them to apply to ports and harbours which they preferred to regard as independ ent. Indeed they would at once point to our own action in 1861 in establishing a telegraph station on the Maklab isthmus, without reference either to the Sultan of Maskat or to any other authority. Even if, in the interim, the Sultan had to some extent reasserted his power, they would still argue that this fell short of sovereignty, since the maximum assertion of that authority that Major Cox recommends or that the Sultan is at all likely to undertake is the planting in a few of tlm coast-ports of Walis (probably local men) who would in all probability be obliged to content themselves, as does the Wall at Khasab, with collecting such dues as would pay for their own maintenance, without remitting anything in the form either of revenue or of tribute to Maskat. Still moie certain is it that 1 ranee would take this line in the event of seizure of a port or base by Russia. In no circumstances would she be likely to interpret the Anglo-Prench Declaration in a sense unfavourable to her ally. Indeed she might even, v bile admitting the restriction or disability imposed upon herself, decline absolutely to join hands with us in enforcin 0, it against any third party. Next, if we turn to the positive aspect of the case—not only is it desirable that any foreign Power should be prevented from acquiring a base on the Musandim promontory, but, if Admiral Bosanquet’s views are sound, and if, as he says, that promontory is for naval purposes the most important strategical position in the Guli, then it would appear to follow that, if we are to prevent our rivals from establishing themselves upon it, the only alternative is to anticipate them by anterior action ourselves. This biings me to the various recommendations put forward by our advisers. In the event of our deciding not to re-introduce the Sultan of Maskat upon the scene, Major Cox recommends that we should again plant a Native Agent at our old telegraph quarters near Khasab. Colonel Kemball, on the other hand, m what seems to me a somewhat hesitating letter, advises us to do nothin^. If, he says, we re-occupy the Elphinstone Inlet, we may offend the Sultan. If w r e bring in the Sultan, then we shall debar ourselves in the future, and shall bring him into undcsiiable relations with the Trucial Chiefs. I may say a word about both alternatives. The risk of offending the Sultan is, in my opinion, infinitesimal, and is clearly disregarded by Major Cox, who is in a much better position to know what the mind of that potentate is. We have merely to point out to him, if he enquires, that the measure is one of precaution, directed against the chance of a movement by some foreign Power which would be certain in the end to compromise his independence, in order to remove anv reasonable objections or suspicions on his part. The resumption of our position and rights at Maklab need not interfere with the limited amount of jurisdiction that°his solitaiy I^Vali exeicises in that neighbourhood, nor need it be ragarded as any more extraordinary than our corresponding position at Bassidore. Our rights at Bassidore, even though not actively exercised, will probably be sufficient to keep the Russians away from Kishm, unless of course they mean fighting, and similarly the re-institution of a British post in the Elphinstone Inlet would opeiate as a detcirent, except at a similar risk, to any other Power, contemplat ing a landing in that neighbourhood. V„ Tiie P omt Colonel Kemball’s second alternative is that, in attempt- iag to exclude others (as I have shown a probably quite illusory endeavour), we shall exclude ourselves. As for the Sultan being brought into contact with the 1 racial Chiefs, since this state of affairs has already existed for more than half a century on the Batineh coast, without any detriment to either party or to ourselves, it seems to me that it may be disregarded. The last sentence brings me to a parenthetical examination of the strip of coast between Mureyr and Khor Fakan, which is under the direct control of descendants or dependents of the Jowasmi Sheikh of Shargah. They fly his flag and they offer no recognition of any kind to Maskat. From Khor Fakan north wards to Dibba there is a further maritime belt, the Sharkiyeen inhabitants of which are under Jowasmi, as distinct from Maskat, influence. Now it appears that in Colonel Ross’ time we held this entire strip of coast from Mureyr to Ribba to be subject to the Maritime Trace—in other words, we recognised it as being a dependency of the Chief of Shargah. I cannot see whv we should change this policy. We are much safer off if we can reasonably apply to this maritime belt the conditions of the Maritime Trace, under which the Trucial Chiefs are prohibited from ceding or selling any portion of their territory save t° tbe^ British Government, than we should be if we persuaded the Sultan to establish his authority over it. For in that case the French would say that the Sultan s action was a belated political move instigated by us, which could not be allowed to supersede or cancel the presumptionof the preceding half century ; and, as we ourselves should have thrown over the claims of the Jowasmi Sheikh, we could not afterwards appeal to them for protection. In our ingenious attempt, then, to bring in the Sultan, and to shelter the entire Musandim peninsula under the provisions of the Anglo-French Declaration, we might find that we had overreached ourselves, and sacrificed even the small positive amount of security that we now enjoy. I am inclined therefore to think that we should state the case as above to the Secretary of State, and should tell him that in our opinion the balance of advantage is in favour of reasserting British claims to the Maklab isthmus rather than of advocating and emphasising the authority of Maskat. We might take advantage of the opportunity to point out that there is no Sheikh of Musandim, as the Foreign Office suppose : although their argument that, supposing there to be such an individual, it is preferable to treat him as* independent, rather than as subject to Maskat, is in principle identical with the view that we have espoused. The 6th October 1902, CURZON.« he says, we re-occupy the Elphinstone Inlet, we may offend the Sultan. If we bring in the Sultan, then we shall debar ourselves in the future, and shall bring him into undesirable relations with the Trucial Chiefs. I may say a word about both alternatives. The risk of offending the Sultan is, in my opinion, infinitesimal, and is clearly disregarded by Major Cox, who is in a much better position to know what the mind of that potentate is. We have merely to point out to him, if he enquires, that the measure is one of precaution, directed against the chance of a movement by some foreign Power which would be certain in the end to compromise his independence, in order to remove any reasonable objections or suspicions on his part. The resumption of our position and rights at Maklab need not interfere with the limited amount of jurisdiction that his solitary Wali exercises in that neighbourhood, nor need it be ragarded as any more extraordinary than our corresponding position at Bassidore. Our rights at Bassidore, even though not actively exercised, will probably be sufficient to keep the Russians away from Kishm, unless of course they mean fighting, and similarly the re-institution of a British post in the Elphinstone Inlet would operate as a deterrent, except at a similar risk, to any other Power, contemplat ing a landing in that neighbourhood.- r- 'r : : a v r 1U wnm S66TUi&gt; XtJ xut 7 ~cir rrtT-rTT. . tt he says, we re-occupy the ElphinstoneTnlet,' we mav offend tlie tf we bring in the Sultan, then we shall debar ourselves in the f„f,® S “ W j , ^ bring him into undesirable relations with the Trucial Chiefs T t, ’ ^ S la i about both alternatives.

Tne following positions were stated to have been selected. Or, the North side, Clarence Straits between Kishm Island and the Mainland commanding Bunder Abbas: on the south side, Khor Kauri, a passage between Sheep Island and thus western shore of Musandim Peninsula. With a view to prevent the occupation by Foreign Powers of Malcolm’ end Elphinstone Inlets, which form good harbours on the Peninsula, it was recommended that flag-staffs should be erected on the ist}mus between these two inlets, on Telegraph Island (in Elphir.stone Inlet) 'attracting special attention, to re-occupy th£ old and on She up Island. The Government of India's despatch was sent-to the Foreign Office with our letter of the 24th February which stated that the ^question will no !r doubt be considered by the Lords Corr,issi oners of r, the Admiralty. I/o immediate action appears to be 'required except the erection of certain flag-staffs, and this has already be -r approved in principle by 'Lord Lansdowne in your letter of 2'7 February 1902 'and by Lord George Hamilton's despatch Ho. 4 of '27 February 1903'. At the same time a copy of the Government of India's despatch and of our letter to the F.O. was sent to the Admiralty. A. further Secret despatch from the Govt, of India, dated 3 March 1904, called attention to a report by Commander Kemp on the KJior K7\awi, and endorsed the recommendation that early steps should be taken to secure this base for our own purposes by planting a flag-staff on Sheep Island. This despatch was forwarded for information to the Foreign Office and Admiralty on the 30th March with a formal covering letter, and without comment. ja r Teen Lord Curzon was in this country, he ashed TU IL frt ms verbally So let him Know what was being done in iLi III. the matter. On the 6th June last I wrote to explain HU and gave him a quotation from our letter to the F.O. of 24 February, to which I said no reply had been received. On the 21st July Lord Curzon wr'Ote to Sir Arthur Godley, saying that he had written both to Lord Lansdowne and Lord Selborne who disclaimed responsibility for the delay on the part of the F.O. andand th&amp; Admiralty. Draft letters, on Sir A. Godley's suggestion, mere then put forward hy the Department in the ordinary course to the F.O., ashing 'whether 'there is any objection to authority now being given 'to the Government of India to carry out their 'proposal to erect the flag-staffs',and to the Admiralty informing them of the inquiry addressed to the F.O. These drafts were approved by the Secy, of State and the Political Committee and letters were sent to the F.O. and Admiralty on the 8th August. On the 17th August the F.O. replied that 'Lord 'Lansdowne sees no objection to authority now being 'given to the Government of India to carry out their ''proposal, provided that care is tah?n to erect the •flag-staffs in the manner best calculated to avoid 'arousing undue attention'. A draft telegram informing the Government of India that their proposal ivas ••approved by H.1I. Government', subject to the caution expressed in the F.O. letter, was approved in the ordinary course by the Secretory of State and the Political Committee,and sent on the 24th August. $A/ ' J’ V- P.S. Lord Cvrzon's letter of 21 July to Sir A. Godley stated that he had been told by Lord Lansdome that the case was hung up in the Admiralty: that he had then written to Lord Selbome who had replied that *it certainly is not the case that the question ...is hung up here. We ansvjered India Office fully in two letters dated 11 March and 3 May and nothing is pending here'. It should be explained that these tv)o letters were confined to discussing the question of telegraphic communication in the Gulf and said nothing either as to the selection of bases oti the erection of flag-staffs at Musandim.3l&lt; 3 1 FOREIGN OFFICE November 29th, 1904 I cm directed by the Marquess of Lansdovvne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant respecting the proposed erection of flag- staffs on Telegraph Island and on Sheep Island, and in which you enquire what flag should be hoisted at those places. It appears to His Lordship that as the places are not in British territory, the Blue Ensign of the Indian Marine should be hoisted rather than the Union Jack, but His Lordship would suggest that Mr. Secretary Brodrick should consult the Lords Commis sioners of the Admiralty on the subject.

Should nostile comment be roused by the erection of flags, I do not think that the particular pattern of flag erected would affect the character or a mour propre of it.

If the use of the commercial flag on the other hand would ,it is con sidered^ disarm the criticism of the civilized Powers to some extent, then I suggest that the Red Ensign be used on week days and that the Viceroy's flag hoisted on Sundays, and festival days, hostile comment could then be replied to from thfc stand-point most convenient to usTelegram From- The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla.

To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Port William, the 3rd March 1904. Sir, In continuation of our Secret despatch No. 16 (External), dated the 21st January 1901, we have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy No. 1171, dated the 19 th January 1904, with of the marginally noted communication enclosure. from the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, forwarding a copy of a report on Khor Kawi. The information now furnished confirms the view expressed in paragraph 5 of our despatch of the 21st January. 2. With reference to Commander Kemp’s remark, about the presence of a Wali of the Sultan of Maskat in Kamzar, we would invite attention to the account, which is given of this place and of the nature of its connection with Maskat, in Major Cox’s letter No. 290, dated 2nd July 1902, which formed an enclosure of our Secret despatch No. 192 (External) of 23rd October 1902. Then, as now, there was apparently no regular Wali, but the elders acknowledged the sovereignty of the Sultan of Maskat, though they paid no dues, and the Sultan’s authority was so shadowy and ineffective that both Colonel Kemball and Major Cox considered that it might be ignored, and in this view we con curred. At any rate, our present proposals do not involve any interference with the status quo at Kamzar, which is situated on the northern face of the Mussandim promontory and at some distance from Khor Kawi. 3. It appears from Commander Kemp’s report that the Khor is admirably suited for a flying naval base, and we have no hesitation in endorsing our former recommendation that early steps should be taken to secure this base for our own purposes by planting a flagstaff on Sheep Island which encloses the Khor on the west. We have the honour to be, Sir, YourFORT WILLIAM. O I\ 1 J ] lOiST DEP ARTMEZSTT. BECHET. External.

From—His Excellency Rear-Admiral G. L. Atkinson-Willes, Naval Com- mander-in-Chief, East Indian Station, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to my letter of the 8th ultimo, No. 1171, relative to my recent cruise in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, a report of the survey of Khor Kawi by H. M. S. “ Sphinx ”, with plan. 2 . The report confirms my opinion expressed therein that Khor Kawi will make a valuable flying base and coaling station. Dated H. M. S. “Sphinx” at Basrah, the 31st December 1903 (Confidential). From— Commander W. Kemp, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, To— His Excellency Rear-Admiral G. L. Atkinson-Willes, Naval Commander- in-Chief, East Indian Station. I have the honour to forward the following description of Khor Kawi:— Anchorage. —The anchorage is well-sheltered, safe, and commodious. As far as the depth of water goes, nature of bottom, &amp;c., I consider the whole anchorage to be equally good, hut preference should be given to an anchorage north of position shown on chart as anchorage (2). South of this the ebb tide runs strongly and with so many eddies as to make a ship surge about her anchors, this is not sufficient to render anchorage in this part of the harbour unsafe, but only uncomfortable. Nature of the bottom .—I consider the bottom over the whole anchorage to he sufficiently good holding ground. It consists of sand and gravel, and soft and broken coral, I do not think there is anywhere hard rock. The cliffs ashore are of a soft and slaty nature, and are much worn by the sea at their bases. JLidden dangers. —I am of opinion there are no hidden dangers, the soundings shown are only those which could be conveniently put on the plan, many more were taken, which cannot be put in on account of space. Native fishermen also reported that none exist. Tides. H.TV. E.C. 10-15. The ebb tide running to the north-west is much stronger than the flood the opposite way. The greatest ebb tide we experienced was If knots, this may sometimes be increased to 2 knots. The flood never ran more than f knots. The ebb and flood streams begin to make about three hours after low and high water by the shore. Towards the southern entrance the ebb runs with many eddies,, but steadies down into* a steady stream as the harbour broadens. Water .—Ships using this harbour would have to depend on themselves for water. Some would probably he obtained by sinking wells at Seedie Bay. There are six wells in south-east cove, the water is good for this part of the coast, hut the amount is limited. There are also three or four wells in south cove, water slightly brackish. Population .—The principal village in the vicinity is at Kamzar, where there are about 500 people. The head man of the place,, who is the Sultan of Maskat’s Wali, lives here. He visited the ship and told me that the place is considered by all the inhabitants to be under the Sultan of Maskat. Two or three families of fishermen live in south-east cove, where they have a few date trees, and a few more families come in the spring to* south cove for fishing; otherwise the harbour is uninhabited. Observation spot. —Marked by a cairn of stones in Seedie Bay. Position, by artificial horizon—latitude, 26-21-20; longitude, 56-25-55.. . T, ' e rorulstca( l south of the harbour in which are south-east and south coves is free from danger, hut open to the Shatoa and therefore not a good anchorage South cove is protected from sea-ward and would afford anchorage for torn °d&lt;&gt; boat destroyers, &amp;c but is tdo limited for larger vessels. At both these coves theie is level ground for about, 15Q yards to the foot of the cliffs. 2. I would respectfully submit that this harbour is excellently fitted for a flying naval base in the event of naval operations in the Persian Gulf In addition to its natural advantages as an anchorage given above it alsJ appears to me to possess the following from a tactical point of view' (1) The great advantage fora flying base of possessing two entrances easily navigable by day or night. 3 ' entrances (2) Good look-out and signal stations from the neighbouring hills, opposite thfentonc^ hiSh ^ ^ r0Und ^ gUn fll ' e ’ eXCe ^ Mediately (4) Easily defended against attack by land, though such an operation ■would not presumably bo undertaken against a flying base. (5) Sufficient level ground in Seedie Bay for the erection of temnorarv hospitals, store-places, or workshops. L * (6) Easily capable of a hasty defence. With regard to this, heavy suns could be landed and mounted On pier point which would cover the whole of the northern entrance. The defence of the southern entrance would be more difficult. The best place for improvised batteries would, in my opinion, be south east cove where there is a level space for a sufficient number of heavy tn lns • at all other points the cliffs and hills are too steep and high for heavy ( 4 ^ and above) guns to be mounted without great difficulty. Light guns could be nut -anywhere, Guns could not be mounted on the hills facing and commandino- •the south entrance of the harbour without great difficulty and the work carried •on without interruption. Guns could be rpounted in south cove, but would only command the extreme western side of the harbour. In my opinion the harbour could be defended with observation mines, good stations for which .perfectly concealed, could be made in the various gullies running into the* hills. 0 Foreign Office Press—No. 373—4-2*04—44.No. 16 of 1904 .

Erom this correspondence it will be seen that the subjects under examination fell under three heads ^ (i) The selection of suitable naval bases or coaling stations at the entrance to the Gulf. (ii) The choice of a telegraph station either at Henjam or Bassidore (Basiduh).

The subject is no directions of the character , | ' [ th a t has been promised. But one that we shall discuss in the fu^bCTdra^teh^tlmt^_^ ^ leteis since it ateribes to the Government of India steps which have not been taken./ 4. The (juestion of tho position to be assumed bv Great Britain at the entrance to the Persian Gulf either in the event of'hostilities with a foreign I ower, or—which is perhaps even more important—with a view to preventin'- the acquisition of coaling stations or harbours by such Powers in time of peace' resolves itself into a decision as to the best stations to he occupied on the’ northern and southern sides of the entrance. Stations outside the Gulf or inside it at any distance from tho mouth, will not enable a fleet to operate with nearly so much rapidity or advantage: while the configuration of the entrance the two sides of which are in sight of each other, is such as to give to a naval 1 ower, suitably established on either coast, a command of the interior waters so absolute as to enable it to dispense with stations farther up the Gulf and to exercise a commanding control over the movements of a Power possessing any such bases. For this purpose the anchorage at the eastern end of Kishm Island, which is formed by the islands of Kishm, Larak, and Hormuz, hein- enclosed between them and the mainland, on which stands the port of Bunder Abbas, appears to afford an almost ideal position on the northern side. The anchorage extends far up the channel between Kishm and the mainland v men is known as Clarence Straits. It is well screened from the sea * it would accommodate the largest fleet; it commands an important Persian trading port and trade route; and there has been for a long time past a consensus of expert naval opinion that this is the first position that should e occujned by Great Britain, together with the adjoining islands, in the event of such action being required. The anchorage in question is not one where a coaling station w^ould probably be established, or which would call lor detence. But as a place of rendezvous for a fleet that desired to com mand the entry to the Gulf, and to prevent the acquisition of Bunder Abbas or t le neighbouring islands by a foreign Power, it would appear to be admirably adapted for the purpose. y b. i lie investigation conducted by the Viceroy and the Admiral on the oppo site shores of the mouth of the Gulf, where they explored the various harbours, inlets, and fiords of the curiously indented promontory commonly known as Cape Musandim, led to equally clear conclusions. It will be seen from the report ot the JNaval Commander-in-Chief that he advocates establishing a lien as a coaling station upon the anchorage of Khor Kawi on the western side of the peninsula, presuming that further surveys, wFich he ordered, but the results of winch w T e have not yet learned, confirm its desirability as an anchorage. At the same time it would be necessary to take steps to prevent the occupation by foreign Powers of the fine harbours of Kubbat Ghazira (Malcolm Inlet) and Knor-ash-Shern (Elphinstone Inlet), which pierce the peninsula at its narrowest point, and are only prevented from mingling their waters by a narrow isthmus or tongue of land a few hundred yards in width. These harbours are not required by us, because there are superior positions elsewhere, and because oi their torrid and insupportable climate in the summer. At the same time it is undesirable that any foreign flag should be planted in either of them or that any question, save of British ownership, should arise. Fortunately this question is one that admits of easy solution. Elphinstone Inlet has already once been in British occupation. The plinth of the former Telegraph fetation on a small island in tho interior of the Khor is still standing^ and the cable itself w^as taken in former days from Malcolm Inlet across the narrow isthmus that we have described. In Lord George Hamilton’s despatch Iso. 4 (Secret), dated 27th February 1903, we received permission to re-occupy the old lelegraph Station at a suitable opportunity. It seems to us that the best way oi: effecting this re-occupation and of preventing the contino-encv ot foreign rivalry would be to erect a flagstaff on the isthmus that commands the two harbours, and also on Telegraph Island. The posts will be put un unobtrusively, and the action is likely not only not to attract attention, but in all probability to remain undiscovered for a longtime, so rarely are these waters visited by any but British vessels and so infrequently even by these V\ e believe that^ we should have no difficulty in arranging with the local n es who consist only of a few miserable communities of fishermen occupv- mg any villages in the inner recesses of the coves, and acknowledging no Chief or master—to take care of the flagstaffs, and occasionally, or when required to hoist a flag upon them. We would propose, as recommended by tlm Admiral rvin his letter to us, to take similar action in planting a flagstaff on Sheep Island, which constitutes the outer protection of Kkor Kawi. 6 . In their tour of the Musandim Promontory, the Viceroy and the Naval Commander-in-Chief further considered the desirability of placing a light-house on some suitable site at the extremity of the peninsula, both in the interests of navigation, which is compelled to avoid the neighbouring channels except by daylight, and in order still further to emphasise our hold over the Musandim harbours and islands. This light might be placed either on the rocky point of Cape Musandim or on one of the three islands, called the Quoins, that are situated at a little distance from it in the open sea. We believe that, for nautical purposes, the latter might be slightly the^ superior position: but the political advantages of placing the light upon a point of the Musandim Peninsula are deserving of serious consideration, and will probably incline us to select this locality. The matter is one upon which we are about to consult the authorities interested, and we will address you again upon iL In the event of a light-house being built, we think that the cost might properly be charged to Indian revenues. 7. We now pass to a discussion of the second question to which we have referred, viz., that of the re-opening of a British telegraph station at Henjam or Bassidore. We need not recapitulate the arguments which we have employed on a previous occasion, in favour of such a measure; for they have already obtained the approval of His Majesty’s Government. The only question at issue is the choice between the two sites; and it was this question that His Excellency the Viceroy and the Admiral charged themselves more particularly with the endeavour to decide. 8 . The arguments in favour of Henjam appeared to them to be so conclusive, and are so clearly stated in the Admiral’s two letters, that it is un necessary to recapitulate them here. The earlier discussions on the matter, particularly by the naval authorities, appear to have rested on some misappre hension of the object which it is sought to secure. We did not propose the re-institution of our former cable station at Henjam in order to create a naval port or station there (for, as we have shown, there are superior positions nearer to the mouth of the Gulf), hut in order to provide for our ships a place of telegraphic call and signal station at no great distance from the entrance, and to strengthen our hold upon the island of Kishm, where we already possess a British settlement at the western extremity, and to which the smaller island of Henjam physically belongs. For these purposes there can be no doubt that Henjam is a greatly superior locality to Bassidore. It possesses the further advantages that, while Bassidore is rather out of the way and difficult of access except to small vessels, ships of any size can anchor temporarily off Henjam. Moreover, it would be easy to connect the latter by cable with Khor Kawi at a time of emergency, should the Khor ever be utilised as a coaling station. 9. There remains the question of the method by which, if His Majesty’s Government approve of the suggestions now made, we should proceed. Three alternatives appear to-be practicable. Either we may address the Persian Government, and solicit their permission to re-establish our former Telegraph Station at Henjam, a request which, in their present temper, it is more than likely that they would refuse; or we may inform them that we propose to take this step in the exercise of rights of possession, which, though not utilised for years, have never been surrendered; or as suggested by Sir A. Hardinge in his despatch No. 97 (Secret), dated 27th June 1J03, we may simply send a telegraph ship there, with the materials and the necessaiy staff, and may resume possession of the Former site, informing the Persian Government of the accomplished fact, and explaining that we ha\ e decided to restore our old station on the original terms, which included freedom from Customs interference, for the convenience of our ships and Commanders in the Gulf. We may add that the site is quite unmistakable. The plinth upon which the British Telegraph Station stood from 1809 to 1881 is still in a good state at a little distance from the straits on the northern shore of the and the trench in which the cable was laid to the sea is clearly visible. Ihe Malik-ut-Tajar, who held a lease of the Kishm salt-mines, erected a flag-pole4 on this foundation some 12 years ago; but it does not appear that a fla' was ever hoisted upon it, nor are there any representatives of the Persian Govern ment now upon the island. In fact, so far as the Viceroy was able to ascertain, connections are maintained by the inhabitants with the opposite or Arab Coast of the Gulf that mis^ht almost entitle Henjam to be described as a derelict, upon which no trace of Persian sovereignty is now in existence. . 0n ^2 lst . Se P tem ^ er Sir A. Hardinge addressed a telegram to the Foreign Office in which he said that his original proposal which we have just described must, he thought, be modified because of his inability to trace among the records in the Tehran Legation the original Persian of the Shah’s authorisation of 1868, a copy of which was forwarded to your piedecessor with our Secret despatch No. 56 (External) of 7th May 1903. We do not appreciate the force of this argument. The absence or the loss of the Persian ori-inal cannot possibly alter the facts that the concession was granted; that if was acted upon for 12 years; and that incontestable traces of occupation still survive on the spot. It appears to us, therefore, to be open to His Majesty’s Government to adopt whichever method of procedure they may prefer. „ 11 i ^he choice may be expected in part to turn upon the present attitude of the Persian Government and the policy that it is desired to pursue towards them. The experience of His Excellency the Viceroy during his recent isit to Bushire, ^ the subsequent behaviour of the Persian Government with regard to that incident, and the general tone of unfriendliness that has characterised their recent communications, undoubtedly justify the adoption of a firm attitude, and will probably not have predisposed His Majesty’s Govern ment to any unnecessary display of courtesy. In these circumstances, it may be thought desirable to act upon Sir A. Hardinge’s advice, and to restore the telegraph station without more ado. We should be grateful for early instructions on the subject, in order that the cable may be laid and the necessary buildings re-erected during the present cool season. Failin 0, the adoption of this plan, we think that the second alternative would be pre- ieiable to the first, although it is to be feared, as anticipated by Sir A. Hardinge m his letter to the Marquess of Lansdowne of 27th June 1903 that any procedure that might open the door for discussion or protest, could no't fail to be attended by considerable delay. 12. In either case the Persian Government might be conciliated bv the proposal to carry on the telegraph wire either by land or by sea from Heniam to Bunder Abbas. When the Viceroy was at the latter place, he was earnestly pressed both by the local traders and also by the Salar-i-Moazzam, Governor of tne Gult Ports, to lend his assistance to the connection of Bunder Abbas by telegraph with the outer world; and it is scarcely credible that the Persian ov eminent, unless they mean to be deliberately unpleasant, should not welcome an extension which will be both of political and of commercial advantage to them. Should they do so, they might opportunely be reminded that, under the Convention of 2nd April 1868, we possess the right to continue our land line from Jask to some point between that place and Bunder Abbas a phrase which might be interpreted as applicable to any spot short of Bunder skl^f th 80 ^* aS ^ 1G Consulate at Naband, four miles on the Jask the .13* I. n event of His Majesty’s Government accepting our proposals for immediate re-mstitution of a cable station at Henjam, we trust that they will upon reconsideration, consent to bear at least one hall of the cost of the arranw- Requested in our Secret despatch No. 56 (External), dated the 7th May 1J03. 1 he telegraph is asked for in the main in the interests of the naval squadron which is maintained in the Persian Gulf hy His Majesty’s Govern ment : and also on political grounds, which are divided in even proportions between the Imperial Government and the Government of India. The larger part of the expenditure on the shores of the Gulf is already borne hy Indian revenues: and it does not seem fair that any fresh measures that may bo reouired o sustain our influence on the sea—the charge of which has hitherto been assumed by the Home Government (with substantial contributions from our selves) should be debited exclusively to Indian funds.► I k i i fits) 14. We have now detailed at some length the proposals which we recom mend for the protection of our paramount naval, strategical, and political interests in the Persian Gulf. It seems to us most desirable that the oppor tunity of acting while action is still easy, and before we can he forestalled, should not he sacrificed : and we trust to receive early _ permission (in the case I ^f Henjam, which has already been accepted in principle, if possible by tele graph) to proceed in the manner described.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—His Excellency Rear-Admiral G. Atkinson-Willes, Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indian Station. I am desired to refer to your letters No. 872, dated 6th September 1903, and No. 872 (s«c), dated 16th October 1903, on the subject of the recent surveys of possible ports on the Persian Coast of the Gulf and of an additional cable station in those waters. 2. As you are aware the desirability of establishing such a cable station for naval purposes has been accepted by all parties; and the sole question that remains for decision appears to be whether it should be located as originally proposed by the Government of India at Henjam, where we had such a station from 1869 to 1881, or at Bassidore, which is a British possession and was considered to be more suitable by the Admiralty. It would appear from the correspondence that has been forwarded to us, that the question has been regarded by the Naval officers in the Gulf whose reports we have seen, and also by the Admiralty at home, in relation to the selection of a defended naval port in the Gulf, rather than of a station for purposes of telegraphic commu nication. These considerations may coincide; but, on the other hand, they may he widely different. The place that is most suitable for a naval anchorage and establishment may he unsuitable for a cable station, and vice versd. It is, however, the latter and not the former contingency that is mainly involved in the present case : and it is with this object in view that I am directed especially to solicit your advice. 3 . At the same time the question of naval bases, ports of call, or coaling stations in the Gulf is one of supreme importance to British interests; and I am also to enquire whether you have any observations or recommendations to make upon this subject to the Government of India as the result of your present cruise in the Gulf. ' ? * * ’ No. 1295, dated “ Hyacinth' at Bushire, the 3rd December 1903 (Confidential). From-—His Excellency Rear-Admiral G. Atkinson-Willes, Naval Commander- in-Chief, East Indian Station, ^ »phe Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In reply to your letter of yesterday’s date, No. 73 C., upon the subject of the suitability of ports in the Persian Gulf as naval bases, coaling and tele graph stations, he pleased to bring the following remarks to the notice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council. 2. After visiting Henjam and Bassidore, I have no hesitation in saying that the former is the more suitable for a telegraph and signal station. It is easy of approach from either side of the strait, and although not a place which could be transformed into a naval station, it is well fitted for a war signal station, in certain contingencies. A temporary sheltered anchorage can always he found to leeward of the island. 3. Bassidore is not suitable for the following reasons: there are two passages to it one from Henjam through a channel close to the Island of Kishm, which has four fathoms of water in it, and the other from Lingab, where there is a depth of 3J fathoms.c n No. 1171, dated Hyacinth at Bombay, the 9th December 1903 (Confidential).

I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, a short description of places visited by His Excellencv the Viceroy and Governor-General of India and myself during the cruise in November in the Persian Gulf. [Confidential). I.— Maskat. The cove is small for modern vessels, although it has a good depth of water, and when a northerly wind blows it becomes rough inside, even opposite the coaling sheds in Makalla Bay. 2. The Hyacinth, Argonaut, and Fox were anchored off the mouth of the harbour, HoinOne just inside, the It. I. M. S. Hardinge inside of her, an Sphinx, Lapwing, and the B, I. M. S. Lawrence inside of the Hardinge. 3. The new vessel belonging to the Sultan of Maskat was there. She is small,'more like a yacht than a ship of war, and has not any fighting value, except against dhows. 4. The army and the forts are of no use except against the neighbouring Arabs, and are not worth taking into account* il.—M usa®*^ Promontory. &gt; (a) Kuhhat Ghazira [Malcolm Inlet). B. Is a fine large harbour, with a great depth of water. There are two coves on the north-east side, which would serve as anchorages, the better ot the two appearing to be the one with the village of Eilam at its head. y p r om the westerly cove it is easy to climb the ridge of the Maklab Isthmus, and look down upon Elphinstone Inlet. 6 Malcolm Inlet would shelter a large fleet, but it is not suitable as a coaling station, as it would not be easy to defend. Vessels could safely coal m * it from colliers, and it would serve as a good temporary anchorage. L [h) Kuhhat Shabus. 7 . Is small, but would afford shelter to small craft. I did not go inside it. (c) Huhat Shisa [Comhermere Cove). 8. Is a large bay open to the eastward. There is a sheltered anchorage inside Bed Islands for one or two vessels, but it is not of any value except as a temporary shelter from north-westerly winds. (d) Fak-al-Assad Strait. 9. Is quite easy to pass through. The tides are strong and a good speed juld be maintained. It is quite 3 cables across, the rocks drop so perpendi- larly that they look like door-posts.2 (e) The Bays on the northern part of the Promontory. 10. Are all exposed to the north, as the chart shews. (/) Khor Kawi. 11. Is a fine sheltered anchorage. It is 3 cables wide at the northern entrance, and about 6 to 7 cables wide most of its length; the depth of water ^ is from 15 to 19 fathoms according to the chart. 12. It is formed by the island of Jezirat al Ghanam (Sheep Island) and the mainland. The island is about 100 feet high at its lowest saddle, and from its northern end a rocky point juts out about 2 cables and looks like a pier. In the angle thus formed is a ledge of rock which appears to have about 3 feet of water on it, and to cover about an acre. This rocky point makes the harbour secure against any swell rolling in from the northward. 13. To the southward of the point is a Eay formed by an indentation in the island. 11. The Khor appears capable of sheltering several large cruisers at single anchor, and more if moored, besides a number of small craft. 15. Owing to the tides, the northern entrance is more difficult than the southern to enter. The latter is land locked, owing to the conformation of the Musandam Promontory, but for a steamship both are quite easy of approach. 16. Khor Kawi may, on further examination, turn out to be very suitable for a coaling station; a survey will shortly be undertaken. Its strategical position is excellent, and in conjunction with the Islands of Kishm, Henjam, Larak, and Hormuz, it will form a strong position for the control of the entrance to the Gulf. 17. The danger of ships being taken by surprise can be averted by forming a signal station on the high hill on Sheep Island, from which a long range of vision can be obtained, and warning given in sufficient time of the approach of any vessel. 18. The bay at the south-east corner of the southern entrance will also be examined to ascertain its capabilities as a torpedo station. (g) Khor ash Shem (Klphinstone Inlet). 19. Is a magnificent piece of water, 7 miles long. It has anchorages all over it, and many coves. The usual anchorage is near Telegraph Island, which is about the hottest part of it. 20. Surrounded by high mountains and barren rocky hills, no breeze can reach Telegraph Island, or the middle of the Khor, consequently the air must be still and the radiation great. In fact the heat is too great for Europeans to bear, and even the Arab nomads who fish there, move in the hot weather. At 3 p.m. on 20th November (when I visited it) the thermometer stood at 86 0 E. If this is the winter temperature, what must it be in summer ? 21. By landing and climbing the ridge in the Maklab Isthmus, about 200 feet high, one can look down on Malcolm Inlet, and have a fine view of it (except the cove with Filam at its head) and of Elphinstone Inlet. The rid°-e is about equidistant from both inlets. 22. To defend Elphinstone Inlet it would be necessary to hold the ridge of the Maklab Isthmus, as well as the entrance, but owing to the heat it could not be occupied from July to October, and therefore as a naval station it is not of much value. III.— Shargah. 23. This place is quite open to the northward, and with a northerly wind a nasty swell rolls into the roadstead. 24. The Jowashmi Sheikh of Shargah resides here and it is the centre of the pearling fishery, but otherwise it is not of any importance The Sheikh is acknowledged as the most important of the Trucial Chiefs.IV.— Bunder Abbas. 25. This town is situated on the mainland of Persia opposite the town of Kishm in the Island of Kism, from which it is distant about 13 miles. 26. The water is shallow, and ships lie a good 1 miles from the shore, although the Sphinx can go in to about miles from the town. Ten and a quarter miles from it is Hormuz Island, and almost due south, about 18 miles, is Larak Island. 27. Between the town of Kishm and Bunder Abbas and to the westward is a good roadstead at the entrance of the Clarence Strait. This strait would he navigable by large ships, if it were buoyed, as far as Bassidu, which is nearly 65 miles to the westward by this channel. 28. A good anchorage is reported off Laft point, but this is 32 miles from Kishm, and too much out of the way for war purposes. 29. This entrance to the Clarence Strait was, and might be again, the rendezvous of a large expeditionary force operating in Southern Persia. Y.—Hen jam Strait. 30. There is a temporary anchorage off Henjam Island in the strait between that Island and Kishm, and at this point a telegraph station formerly existed. It is about to be resumed by the Government of India, and could be used as a war signal station, if required, as it is easy of approach from either the east or west. 31. It is not of any use as a permanent anchorage or dep6t. As it is only 31 miles from Khor Kawi it could easily be connected with it by cable when found necessary, should that place become a coaling station. VI.— Bassidu. 32 As a deep water channel was said to exist to the southward of Kishm Island, ! examined it in H. M. S. Sphinx, followed later by the K. I. M. S. Lawrence. 33. A 4 to fathom channel was found, a tracing of which will be sent to the Hydrographer, but it is not easy to find, except in fine weather and by use of the lead. It is not at any time suitable for a second class cruiser, but she might use it with care in clear weather. 34. Bassidu was used in the old days by small craft belonging to the Indian Navy. There is deep and good anchorage off it, but it is a small craft place. On going to Lingah from it in the Sphinx we passed over a long bank with 3£ fathoms on it—this being the only passage. 35 The pier is in fairly good order, but most of the old buildings are in ruins A heap of old coal, probably about 5 tons, lies in the open. There is a flan-staff on which the British flag is hoisted, and an old Arab (the British A^ent) receives Bs. 12 a year for doing so (in addition to Bs. 30 as agent, and Bs. 7 for taking mails to and from Lingah). He is a Briton of the British. 36. According to a plan the area of British territory is roughly 600 acres. 37. The Agent confirmed the statement that Singao is British, but that old Bassidu is not. He stated that the Bussian Consul at Bunder Abbas visited Bassidu last spring with a Persian official. 38 Some of the Arabs living at Lingah and in other parts of Kishm are verv anxious to settle at Bassidu under the British, and thus escape the heavy Customs dues, but they have not hitherto been encouraged to do so. It would probably soon absorb the trade from Lingah and the adjacent ports if it became a free port under the protection of the Government of India, g ^ g ra nted to the British in 1820 by the Iman of Maskat, who at that time had a lease of the island of Kishm. When the Persiansforcibly resumed the island no challenge to our rights was ever made, and we have thus kept a footing there. VIL—Lingah. 40. This is an important town, owing to it being a trading centre, and the fact that, unlike most Gulf ports, large vessels can lie within a mile or so of the shore. The anchorage is exposed to the south-west, but sheltered from most winds. 41. Several of the domed cisterns mentioned in N. I. D. Report No. 694 were empty when I was at Lingah and others had only a little dirty water in them. They appeared to have a capacity of about 60,000 gallons each. VIII. —Bahrein. 42. I visited this place in the Sphinx. A second class cruiser drawing not more than 22 feet 6 inches could enter Bahrein harbour one hour before high tide, and anchor 6 miles from the town and about 4 miles from Muharrak. 43. Bahrein is not of any value as a base for war purposes. 44. I notice that in the N. I. D. Beport No. 694, Bar al Katr is said to be under Turkish control. This is not the case. The British support the independence of the Sheikhs, and have lately objected to a Turkish Mudir being appointed for the district. IX.—Koweit. 45. The importance of the Bay of Koweit has been somewhat over-rated, and that of Khor Abdullah lost sight of until it is too late, the Turks having now established themselves at Umkasr, and on the island of Bubiyan. 46. A large vessel could lie in the anchorage in any weather, but a collier could not lie alongside her in a Shamal. Vessels lie about 2 miles from the shore. 47. During the stay of the squadron many small caravans were observed to enter and leave the town, showing that there is probably a considerable trade overland. 48. I proceeded up the Bay in the Sphinx. A second class cruiser can go up to within 2^ miles of the shore near Jehara, which town is over half a mile inland. It is a fine bay, but the shallowness of the water near the shore detracts from its value. The head of the bay is, however, of course more sheltered than the part of it near Koweit. X.—Khor Abdullah. 49. Leaving Koweit with my flag in the Sphinx at 10 p.m., followed by the Lawrence, I proceeded to Khor Abdullah, and entered it at daylight on the following day, passing Ras al Geit, the Turkish post on the south-east of Bubiyan Island, where the Turkish flag was flying. This post cannot be approached to within about 3 miles by water, owing to the mud flats off it. We arrived at the bar between Warba Island and the mainland, and found 2 fathoms at low water. Passing over it into deep water we entered the Khor leading to Umkasr, navigation being quite easy, except for the bar. Arriving near Umkasr, which is a Turkish fort with no village, we anchored, and, after looking round, proceeded out of the Khor. 50. Our observation led us to the conclusion that the proposed railway will probably come to a point on the mainland opposite the north-west corner of Bubiyan Island, where there is a sheet of water, with plenty of depth and room for an anchorage. It can also be approached easily at any time of tide. 51. Bubiyan Island and the shore on the mainland opposite are claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. He has now been formally taken under British5 protection by the Indian Government, and has been directed to establish two posts, one on the north side of Bubiyan island and the other on the north west corner, and the Turks will be warned by him to leave the island. 52. On proceeding out of the Khor Abdullah I noticed a flat with T fathoms on it, at about hours’ flood. The Khor requires a careful survey. XI.— Khor Musa. 53. Having anchored off Khor Musa at 11-30 p.m. in the Sphinx with the Lawrence in company, we proceeded up the Khor at daylight on the following day. When once we were sure that we had struck the entrance, navigation was quite easy. This is ascertained by seeing Bu Saif, a low point with a few trees on it, and the islet of A itch Shaham. From this the Khor is a splendid sheet of water, ending at anchorage No. 1. where a large fleet could anchor. Here it branches into the inlet leading to No. 2, which we did not enter, and to No. 3 anchorage. We went up to within about miles of No. 3, and anchored in 36 feet, whilst a party landed to test the mud flats. It was thought that at high water springs the flats would be covered. The landing at No. 1 will be a difficulty, no doubt, for the banks appear to be no more than mud flats, which may be covered at high water springs under some circumstances. XII.— The Khors Generally. 54. Until a railway is brought from the interior to either Khor Abdullah or Khor Musa, they are not of value to a country strong on land, so that their development belongs rather to the future than the present. I suppose in time Russia will connect her railway system with Khor Musa, and Germany will connect her Bagdad Railway system with Khor Abdullah. It is incumbent on us, therefore, to prepare to hold the entrance to the Gulf, unless we can keep those Powers away from it altogether, which should be our constant aim. XIII.— Conclusion. 55. The Hyacinth and Hardinge having been given a rendezvous 9 miles south-south-east of Khor Musa, His Excellency the Viceroy re-embarked in the Hardinge and I returned to the Hyacinth at 7 p.m., and we pro ceeded to Bushire, where the squadron anchored next morning 5J miles from the shore, and fej miles by water from Bushire town.
