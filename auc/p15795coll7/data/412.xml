Based at AUC’s downtown Tahrir Square campus, for several days from January 25 into the second week of February 2011 he was assigned security shifts at the building at 5 Youssef El Guindi Street, a side street off Mohamed Mahmoud Street.  During this time he tells of being able to “hear everything but see nothing,” and about the conversations he had with police officers stationed nearby.  He reports on what the police had to say about the events at Tahrir Square, for example their not expecting significant demonstrations on January 25, and recalls meeting police officers who had not slept for four days after the 25th and who feared losing control of the protests.  Some police officers and military personnel he spoke with revealed that they did not oppose the uprising against the government.</dc:description><dc:date>2014-01-27</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>20110222</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2011, American University in Cairo.
