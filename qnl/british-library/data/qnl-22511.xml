No oojection was seen to the Company's draft. No ooject-ion seen to the Company's draft. Ivir. Ballantyne saia that the Company assumed that the period of 55 years stated in this x».rticia Vvoulu aute iroin the 2na January 1935. I saia I woula check this point. I pointed out tnat the Company haa not accepted one vvorain^ suggested by us. L t. Ballantyne saia tnat the Company thought our vvoraing too wiae. An abandoned boring might still be potentially proauctive and it would impose/ provisions preamble » Ax^ticle I j article ii.iiiipose a great strain on them if they were to he recjuireo. uo hand, over a horing which had hesn aoanaoned ior, say, 20 or 30 years in a condition lit lor iurther working. I suia I thought that dilficulty woula not arise about accepting their drafts Cla Art icle III , it was agreed to consider this in connection with articles VII and VIII. New i-.rticle III. The Petroleum Department had suggested that tne 10 year period referred to in this Article might run irom 1925. I mentioned the point to I vj T • Ballantyne, who took the view, however, tncou the article as Grafted in the original Ivlining Lease clearly contemplated a pcrioa not later tnan 10 years in any c ireuiiistances from the oate of grant of the Lining Lease. I saici that I would look more closely at tnis point. I think, in fact, that tnere is substantial justification ior nis view. article IV, Mr. Ballantyne agreed to insert after the word 'cause' 1 in line 2 of the new paragraph the words 'arising in Bahrein 1 '. ihe article was otherwise agreed, ^xLicle V. Laot sub-paragraph. I said that we /v'ishea uo consider wnether tne sub paragraph in its present form (wnich was one agreed with the Colonial Office in 1930) woula sufficiently cover tne situation in the event of tne issue of a new consolidating or substituted Order for the Bahrein Orders-in-Council of 1913 and 1922. Ivir. Ballantyne intimated that no difficulty would arise over any drafting alteration to cover such a point. No other difficulty arose over this article.3. New Article VI « No question arose. New Article VII . (i) aovcilty on oil proauceci . I pressej on hx. Ballantyne acceptance ol the redraft which haci 'been proposed hy trie Petroleum . AM A: Department, viz. exemption in respect of ''oil required us iuel for drilling purposes and lor pumping to field storage' ? in substitution for trie wording of the original agreement, which gives exemption to 'oil required for the customary operations 01 the Company's installations in the Sheikh's territories'. Mr. 3allantyne pointed out that the wording to which we o'Djectea was that oi tne original agreement ana intimatea that the Company would see the strongest objection 'Go any modification. The effect of modification would be to deprive them of exemption from royalty on oil used for refining purposes, we would not overlook that that mijit be a matericcl consideration in connection with our demands that tney snoula refine locally. I took note of his objection. (ii) rtoyaltv on natural ^as a nd c^ sinp; nwaq—^asolene&gt; I suggested, and Ivir. Ballantyne agreed, that this extremely technical question couid better be discussed direct between Lr. starling and Lr.Hamilton. I drew his attention, however, to the facts set out m the petroleum Department memorandum. {ill)//o ( i:L i) Date of revision 01 royalties , ivj:. Baliantyne maae no reference to the fact that the Company naci substituted 15 years foi 10 years; nor dia I, (i v ) Iv ^asurement ana accounts . I saia that we saw no objection to the Company 1 s rearaft. (v) It was agreed to discuss the general question of commercial exploitable Quantity ana minimum royalty separately. rticle VIII. (i) I suggestea to Ballantyne that the sheikn should not be deprived of the sum of Hs.10,000 aown to which he would have been entitled under old Article III. JviT. Ballantyne saia tnat tne Company coula not accept 'one ou^^estion tnau tne payment due to be maae within 60 aays of the | taking out of the Mining Lease unaer old Article III was in a different position from the payments to be made on the anniversary of the taking out of tnat Lease, it was neither more nor less than thd first instalment of ' the annual rent and it was not a special lump sum payment, .after further discussion I felL tha.t tne re was some force in tnat argument and took note of his objection. (ii) Proposed amendment of Article VIII by the substitution for the words 11 in which the Company continues work' of the words 'in wnich this Lease continues in operationI urged this modification on ivjr, Ballantyne on the lines suggested in the Petroleum Department memorandum. He replied1 ■ 1 mm — -t- n 5. that the Conipariy's position was coiiiplateiy covered by the initial words of the article. 'Subject to the delay exception mentioned in article IV of this Lease', ana said that while appreciating our point he thought that so far as our positaai v&amp;s concerned it vrola he hetxsr to arrexi the daase to mim we took exception to run; 'in every calendar year in which this jL .ease continues in operation'. I said I thought this would meet the case. New article IX» 1 saici that we felt tnat tne terms of the redraft of this article proposed, by the Company 6a.ve them considerably more elbow-room than they enjoyed at present. In view, however, of their readiness to meet us over the rewording of article VIII, I saici that we should not desire to oppose the redraft. Proposal to substitute tne words 'referred to in Article IV' for tne words 'beyona their control' in lines 5 and 6. Air. Bullantyne, after considerable discussion, said that the Company would not oe able to agree to this modification, iheir reasons were that the words 'beyond their control' were the original phrase and tuat this article was not really in the same position as Article IV. It might well be that matters outside Bahrein might take such a turn as to affect the Company's ability to discharge its obligations. toreover/ New/Article x/&gt; 6. i % Moreover, we would not overlook that the use ol the words 'heyona their control' vvoulu put/ oil the oompany ohe curden of proof in the event of an arbitration. It was, inaeed, quite arguable that the draft as it stood was too wide fron. tne Company's point of view. We agreed to leave it. Nci',; ^x-ticle XI. I pointed out to Air. Ballantyne that the Company haa alreaay certain rights in rcspeco of notice under Article VII of tne main concession. He replied that this was quite a different point ana that his object was to protect tne Company ana to bive them the power to denounce even if they had found oil in certain quantities. I said that it was quite clear that this was a very valuable concession ana that the SiiciKn would be entitled to some substantial xeturn in respect 01 it. Lr. Ballantyne, a^ter discussion, agreed that the concession was one of substantial importance. I suggested that it should be considered in connec tion with comme rc ia1 explo itab1e quantity, ana ne agreed. iMew article XII to navy ..rtlcla N o observations. Mwj.rticle XTX. I pointed out tnat tiie Company haa not accepted our proposal tnat 'correct geological plans and records snail be open to inspection by the sheikh'. ;ve fait that this was an important provision which we wished to press. We understood tnat it was a/'3 7. a provision very widely accepted, which appeared In the I.P.O., 3.C.D. and a.P.O.C. concessionsj as well as in Trinidad. Moreover, in this country there was a statutory provision reQuiring operators to lurnish to H.M.G. all geological inioniiation which the Geological Survey Department might require. There was, thereiore, substantial precedent ior our proposal. Air • Ballantyne saia that the Company were unQouhtecily very jealous about giving away their confidential iniormation in the earlier stages of the development of a concession such as the present. At a later stage, when matters were further advanced, no difficulty would, he imagined, arise. I suggested in these circumstances, tnat a possible compromise might be that tne Company, oy means of an exchange of letters or in some other appropriate way, should be relieved in agreement with us ■ from providing this full confidential j i^iormation in tne early stage of their I Bahrein development - say for a short 1 period of years - on the understanding that they would provide it thereafter. Mr. Ballantyne thought that a compromise on these lin^s might well be reached. ^ to XXTTT. no objection. we/f 8. 4. We then turned to the consideration of the question of local refining and that of commercial exploitable quantity. (A) Local xtefliiin;; . III informal conversation with Mr. Ballantyne a few days earlier 1 had impressed upon him that the Question of local refining was one which was now becoming almost an obsession with the Sheikh ana to which he attached the greatest importance. He would no daibt have confirmed this from Mr.Beilgrave in tne ccurse cf his recoit • - talk with him. it was in these circumstances most important to give the .sheikh some reassurance, Mr. Ballantyne saia that Mr. Belgrave also had left this impression. It was clearly, however, to the Company's interests to refine in Bahrein if they possibly could, because they would be able to secure exemption from royalty on oil used for fuel purposes, and the position really was that they would not refine elsewhere than in Bahrein unless they had to. He agreed to consiaer the possibility of a formula to meet tne sheikh on these lines. 6. He now informed me that the question had been very carefully considered with Mr. Hamilton (and, I understood, w ith Mr. Moffat). They had * come to the conclusion that It was really impossible to meet us over It. Oral assurances as to toe future Intentions of the Company could easily be given, but they were not binding. The greatest difficulty would be _ louna xn giving a formal written assurance such as we ivould like, ihe Company haci no market at present for its products, it was quite possible that it might have no market for refined oil for some years to come, or that it would be able to secure from other competitors already in possession a market only for crude oil, or that it might/9. might be required to pool its crude oil and would have no opening for refined products. It would he a very serious burden on the Company to have a specific obligation to refine locally when this was the position, and they felt the greatest reluctance to commit themselves. The sheikh, if they gave him any under taking in the matter, would inevitably begin to press them after a certain time and this might embitter relations or might lead to financial demands from the Sheikh by way of compensation for the delay in starting a refinery. The Company really felt that they might appeal to H.M.G. to reassure tne Sheikh in the matter and to inform him that in the opinion of H.M.G. the Company appeared to be in earnest and seriously to be contemplating the refining of oil in Bahrein whenever the opportunity occurred, as for the amount of employment which a local refinery would give, the Sheikh appeared to have a completely exaggerated idea. Mr. Ballantyne understood that the personnel required would be relatively very small. He offered on this point to let us have a detailed statement. 7. Aiter much further discussion I put to him as a personal suggestion that, if the attitude of the Company was as he described, it might be possible for them to give certain assurances to H.M.G. in a letter as to their true intentions in regard to refining, on the understanding that this guarantee or undertaking would be for the confidential Information of H.M.G.only, and with a view to enabling H.M.G. with a clear conscience to advise the Sheikh not to press the matter j-urther at the present stage, it would be impossible for H.M.G. to make any suggestion to the sheikh of the nature he/he flad put ioPwaro. at/ the present tiiriej the guarantees which had been given by the Company in their letter of 16th April wGntj no ciisljcincs and wsro mersly 6zprGssions of a pious hope. If, however, something more positive and detailed could he given 'oy the Company to H.to.G. confidentially that would prohahly make a difference. The Company might simultaneously give - a aetailed f\ explanation (which coula be communicated to the Sheikh) in regard to the amount of employment which would be ioivenby the establishment of a local refinery. 8. Mr. Ballantyne said he thought this a very helpful line of approach and that the Company would certainly consider it. On the face of it it would ^o iar to meet the difficulties which they had seen in comidttlng themsexves with the sheikhi it was a very different thing to commit oneself to H.M.G. and to commit oneself to tie Sheikh. (d) a)..jmerci dl exoloitaole Quantity . ■ ^ * I reverted (on the lines suggestedj^r^he Petroleum Department letter of 15th February 1934 and in -he note of my discussion with Mr. Ballantyne of 16th May 1S34) to the importance of a revised arrangement in r^ D ard to minimum royalty and repeated the arguments which had already been put to Mr. Ballantyne. He said that the matter had been discussed with 3an Francisco, but that the Company renamed extremely reluctant to make any advance; felt that they were being asked to make a oubotantial concession without any quid pro quo; and feared that to make sucn a concession to the sheikh would merely open the door for further blackmail in the future. 10/11. 10. Ihere Xollowsd a coiisid.6rcit)le discussion on all aspects of this question, which it is unnecessary to record, ihe main arguments brought to hear upon him were (a) ihe Company were now at a decisive stage in their relations with the sheikh, once the Mining Lease had heen signed its provisions would operate (subject to the possibility of a revision of the rate of royalty) for 55 years. The Sheikh was therefore quite entitled to expect some special consideration of his interests. H.M.G. for their part equally regarded it as of real importance to secure an equitable arrangement for him. If tney could secure that equitable arrangement (and minimum royalties on the basis of Hs.30,000 - 60,000 - 100,000 after five years appeared to them, as at present advlsea to be reasonable) the Company need not fear that we would incite the sheikh to make unreasonable demands subsequently. But it was important, now that the Ivlining Lease was to be concluded, to start it well and to give the Sheikh no legitimate ground for grumbling, we felt that he had such a ground at the moment. (b) Asforaquid pro quo, Mr. Ballantyne had agreed ^s to the importance of the concession represented by the right of three months' notice in theisw Article XI. we should in fact be prepared to meet the Company on the various points outstanding between us over the revised fining Lease in the event of their meeting us over commercial exploitable quantity, if they wisned to suggest any other minor point on which we could make a concession, we would be glad to consider it. (i added, however, in reply to an enquiry from him, that it would not be possible in view to link up an increase in the royalty/12. royalty of the nature we suggested and an extension of the area held hy the Company. They might he quite sure that any extension of area in Bahrein would be on completely different financial terms and would raise much larger financial questions). Mr. Ballantyne restated the objections of the Company, hut was clearly impressed by the importance of this point. He finally enquired whether the figures rte.30,000-60,000-1 lakh were to be regarded as bargaining figures or v/hether they represented our minimum. I said they represented our minimum, on the other hand, in the event of the Company meeting us on this basis we would, I though? ^quits prepaiBd to meet them as rq^rds tiLt;uablG to tne extent, e»g» cf postponiig the coming into operation of the 1 laich stage until 7 years or the like from the date of the taking out of the Mining Lease. Mr. Ballantyne said that he felt that the point must again be put to 3an Francisco and that the Company should reconsider it. He mid pass oi to the Canpany thou^ihe could not, of course, say vtot Ueir vdartim wDUld be, the arguments that had beai used and make it dsar to them that a ccnoessicn in 1his matter would be wall seoi as well as smoothing relations for the future with the sheikh. I thanked him. / 11. It was agreed finally that the next stage should oe a discussion between kr. Hamilton and Mr. Starling, at which Mr. Ballantyne and I should be present, on the question of royalty on casing heaa gasolene, etc., ana that In the meantime to. Ballantyne shoula think over the various suggestions which had been put to him in the course of our discussion. He remarked that the question of royalty on natural gas and casing head gasolene might well oe material from the point of view of any general j - mancial settlement between us, on behalf of the Sheikh, and the Company.

You refer in your letter under reply to the fact that arrangements could, as a special case, be made for the Political Agent to discuss matters direct with the Field/ Manager in the event of Mr. Russell's appointment. As I understand it, the Political Agent and the Field Manager have taken this course in the past even before Mr, Skinner was appointed Chief Local Representative, and there seems to oe no reason why they should not continue tjb do so.

BAHREIN OIL . Mr. Starling anci I discussed on lath July with Mr. Hamilton and to. Ballantyne (a) The Comuany's proposals in reKard to royalty on casino heaa gasolene and natural .^s . (see Petroleum Dept. memorandum enclosed in Mr. Starling's letter of the 34th fey, on P.Z.5468/34, ana the revised New article VII of the Mining Lease suggested hy the Company in the rear aft enclosed in Mr. Ballantyne's letter of 28th April 1934, on P. Z.2663/34). ho a result of the discussion it was agreed that as regards natural gas we would accept the Company's proposal and that Mr. Hamilton should obtain further information on various points raised hy Ix. starling in connection with royalty on casing head gasolene. When that information was available he coula then aiscuss the matter with Mr. starling with a view oo an agrea^ent on tnls paint rsoctm Mr. Ballantyne suggested that in the event of the Company giving way to us on this point the concession woula be one of some value. It was pointed out to him in reply that the course of tne discussion haa maae it clear that casing head gasolene woula be likely to represent a relatively very small portion of the Company's output; and that if the Company shoula defer to our view as to the basis on which royalty was to be computed the financial effect of such a concession woula be small. (^) Local Refining . A lengthy discussion took place on this question. Mr« Ballantyne ana Mr. Hamilton said they had carefully considered tne proposal put forwara at my interview with Mr. Ballantyne on the 3rd July (P.Z.4436/34, paragraphs/paragraphs 5-8). While they had, at first, heen much attracted the suggestion that a confidential undertaking should be given to H &lt;]W,G., who would thereupon oissuade the Sheikh from pressing his demand for local refining, they felt on xurther consideration that no advance was practicahl© in this direction. The Company's objections to committing themselves were objections of principle. They had every intention ol refining locally, but tney did not wish to commit themselves specifically in writing, a moral liability uo refine ■would be even more binding on them than the terms of a positive legal liability. It was possible, too, that tney might fino a market lor crude oil only, in which case there coula be no question of their refining oil in Bahrein. Apart from that, they did not wish to enter into an under standing which might oe the subject of arbitration and in respect of which it might be difficult for the Company wholly to satisfy an arbitrator that commercial conditions put local rexining quite out of their power. There were certain aspects of this question on which the Company must reserve its right to be the judge. It was again pointed out to them that this question of refining was one on which the sheikh had the most definite views and that it was most important for the Company to do jvhat they coula to satisfy him. we appreciated their difficulties, but the facts must be faced. After discussion the following formula was suggested to them; 'in the event of the Company refining and if general commercial conditions permit, the company propose, if and when their production exceeds 350,000 tons, to refine not less than 30% of the excess in any year over such figure at Bahrein'. Mr. Ballantyne was ultimately disposed to refer the matter back to 3an Francisco. Mr. Hamilton, however, m alntained his objections to any formula or understanding. It/4? It was&gt; iio ociiu., t/0 titiG Company' s inljsrsst/ t»o rGXins locally, for they woula get their fuel oil free of royalty and they woula he saved freightage charges. Apart from that they appreciated the importance of friendly relations with the sheikh. It was to the Sheikh's interest not to press them in the matter. They could he relied on to do tneir hest for him. ±he Company ultimately enquired whether it would satisfy the Sheikh if they were now to start to build a refinery in Bahrein - certain plans had already heen ciiscussea. I said I tnougnt it would, hut it would, of course, not he enough for the refinery merely to he built or in building. It would be necessary to use it to some extent. Ihey said they appreciated this and it was agreed to leave the matter over for another month or so. The Company were particularly anxious that we should not make a condition as regards refining a term of the sheikh 1 s concurrence in the terms of tne modified Joining Lease. It was agreed that the question of minimum royalty should be discussed with kr. Ballantyne on the 17th July. J.G. LAITHWAITE. 14th July 1934.M .

On the evening of tue 7th July the Company had however^ received a telegram to the effect that tne purchaser had been warned by the Persian Legation, though whether through the Japanese Government or not was not clear, that in purchasing oil obtained oy the Standard Oil Company from Bahrein lie did so at his own risk, as the Standard Oil Company had no title to oil won in Bahrein, which was Persian territory and in which tiiey had no concession from the Persian Government. 3* The Company, after consultation with San Brancisco, decided that it was impossible to divert the El Segundo cargo/s ^ 2. cargo from Bahrein and tiiat the 'best coarse weald be to give the parchaser an indemnity.

Mr. Ballantyne mentioned in the coarse of his discassions that he anderstood tnat the State Department at Washington proposed to send no reply to the latest Persian Note ahoat the Bahrein oil concession; and that the Standard Oil eqaally proposed to take no notice of it. It might, however, 'be. necessary to consider, in the event of the Persians raising difficulties of ■chis type in the fatare, some method of circamventing them, e.g.by poaring oil won from Bahrein into a general Standard Oil pool with a view to making its identification more difficalt.

Apparently the Persian Legation had obtained knowledge ol the transaction because they went direct to the Asano Bussan Company, lodged their warning there and also published a general warning in the Japanese Press The 'El Segundo' arrived at Yokohama on the 10th July, began to unload immediately and is expected to finish on the 11th July. The message, which is from Tokio, states it is expected that the deal will go through under the 'guarantee' of the Standard Oil Company of California. Yours sincerely, H,R.Bal1antyne. J.G.Laithwaite,Esq., India Office, Whit ehall,S .W.1.I)WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 17th July 1934. Dear Mr .Ballantyne , ' ^ ' You sent me in your letter of 26th April a draft of the Company's mining lease in a form the Company thought 'should 4 be accepta'ble to all parties concerned'. We have since discussed, on several occasions, the modifications which His Majesty's Government, acting on behalf of the Sheilch, wish to see made in the mining lease appended as the third schedule to the original concession of 1925 and also those put forward by the Company in the document enclosed in your letter of 20th April. 2. In the light of those discussions, I now write to suggest the following modifications in the draft enclosed in your letter of 20th April:- 1 (i) Article IV, line 2 of new second sub - paragraph, after x the word 'cause' insert the words 'arising in Bahrein'. (ii) Article V, last sub- paragraph, amend to read 'so long as the provisions of Bahrein Orders in Council 1913 and 1922 or any Order in consolidation thereof or in substitution therefor or supplementary thereto remain in force'. (iii) Article VII. It has been agreed that certain proposals put to the Company on behalf of the Sheikh in regard to the royalty on casing head gasoline shall be further discussed when the result of enquiries which the Company are making is known. (iv) Article VIII, amend to read 'in every calendar year in which this lease continues in operation'. •k'Ballantyne, Esq., ^ ^ Bahrein Petroleum Conpany Ltd., 19, Moorgate, S.C.2.2. (v) Article XIX. We must, I fear, press our proposal that this should be amended to provide that 'correct geological plans and records shall be open to inspection by the Sheikh'. As I explained to you, this is a provision very widely accepted, which appears in the I.?.G., 3.G.D., and A.P.O.C. concessions as well as in Trinidad, v/nile in this country there is a statutory provision requiring operators to furnish His Majesty's orovernment with all geological information which the Geological Survey Department might require. There is, tnerefore, substantial precedent for it. On the other hand, we should be quite ready to insert a provision that the geological reports should be regarded as confidential for a period if the Company wished for this; and in the event of the revised wording which we have suggested being accepted, we should also be prepared to agree that the Company should be relieved from providing this full confidential information for the first five years oi the currency of the mining lease. 3. Apart fran the points referred to in the preceding paragraph, we have discussed at considerable length the question of minimum royalty (any variation in the existing arrangements regarding which will of course necessitate certain amendments of the draft mining lease supplementary to those discussed abov^) arid I have put certain proposals to you on this point for consideration. I understand that you will communicate further on this subject with me in due course. You will remember that our acceptance of certain of the modifications suggested by the Company is closely connected with the reaching of a satisfactory settlement regarding it.

A, 1 ol Z jl Heroort Pearson remarks that Article V of the Agreement of 2nd December 1925 provides for a Mining Lease in terms of the Tnird Schedule. The Third Schedule, Aroicle I, contemplates a Mining Lease for a period of 55 years, which would run from the date when it became operative, i.e. normally the date of its execution. We can, in these circumstances, accept the Company 1 s contention. (b) Jew Article _III. You will remember that the suggestion r Starling Esq., &gt;troleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley St., S.W.I. was/ 12. was made in the Petroleum Department Memorandum on the amendments proposed by the Company in the Mining Lease that the 10 year period referred to in this Article might run from 1925, bu that Mr• Ballantyne took the view that the Article as drafted clearly contemplated a period not later than 10 years in any circumstances from the date of grant of the Mining Lease• Sir Herbert Pearson agrees with the Company's contention that the 10 year period runs from the date of the commencement of the Mining Lease, i.e. normally the date of its execution. (c) Article V. On the point which I raised with Mr.Ballantyne in this connection Sir Herbert Pearson suggests that the last part of Article Y in the revised draft might be amended to read:- 'So long as the provisions of Bahrein Orders in Council 1913 and 1922 or any Order in consolidation thereof or in substitution therefor or supplementary thereto remain in force'. I will put this to Ballantyne. (d) gew Article VIII . Liability of Company for the lump smn payment of Rs.l0,C00 under the terms of old Article III. This has/3. has also 'been discussed vjitii the Legal Adviser, As a result we reached the conclusion that if the Company are now, as from 2nd January 1935, to proceed on the royalty basis with a minimum annual payment of Rs.30,000, in other words, as though, if the terms of Schedule III were retained in entirety, the declaration under old Article IX had been made and had become operative, we cannot legitimately press for payment of a separate lump sum down of Rs.lO,CCO. This will perhaps be of less importance if we succeed in securing some concession from the Company in respect of a minimum royalty of the nature at which we are at present aimi ng. 2 ' 1 am sending copies of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office and Seal at the Admiralty.

JWy dear Starling, I send herewlttKa record of my talk with Ballantyne on the 17th regarding the Mining Lease, local refining, and commercial exploitable quantity. 2. No difficulty arose about the Aiinlng Lease posiuion ana the line taken with the Company has been agreed with the Petroleum Department. ^ Local Refining, as the records of the various discussions with Ballantyne which have taken place in the last year will show, we have pressed this consistently upon the Company and there has from time to time been reason to hope that the Company would meet us either by giving a confiaential guarantee to H.M.G. or by actually erecting a reiinery. You and I also went into the matter in great detail with Hamilton and Ballantyne on the 12th July. As you will see from the record now enclosed, the Company have, however, reached the conclusion that they Starling, Esq .., cannot/ Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley street, 3/.V. 1,cannot meet our requirements, and I confess that I do not think we can press them further, though we can 3 I think 9 emphasise that it is very much to their interests, if they vvish to work smoothly with the Sheikh, to take steps for local refining at as early a stage as possible« The real weakness of oui position is that the Company's hands ^re entirely free, the existing agreement containing no provision binding them to refine locally, on the other hand, they have consistently urged that the prospects, in fact, of their refining locally, ana that at a not very distant date, are good ana they have emphasised that on commercial grounds the facts that fuel oil for use in refining would oe royalty free if they refined locally and that local refining would avoid heavy freight charges are stron &amp; inducements to establish a refinery if they have any market for refined products. On the whole, therefore, suoject to your views and those of the Admiralty, I think we must let the matter drop. I may add that I discussed it yesterday morning with Belgrave, who sa^ s that the Sheikh will certainly not he well pleased at the position, t)ut he recognises the weakness of our position and the absence of any effective lever in dealing with the Company. Minimum/u 4 ° i!4n.Linufn royalty, in your letter of 15th February pxr..- 19.34, P.D.21 part 7, you suggested the possibility of j/^x minlmuiH annual payments on the basis of, say, Rs.30,000 for the first two years, Rs.60,000 for the next three years, ana Rs.100,000 thereafter. As the record of various conversations will have shown, this has been consistently pressed on the Company, ihe offer now put forward by Ballantyne falls snort of that figure. But I am on the whole disposea to think that it is not a bad one. it represents at its maximum more than double the existing minimum royalty of Ss. 30,000, and in the interim an increase of Rs.20,000 per annum on that minimum royalty. While a maximum figure of 1 lakh would have safeguarded the Sheikh more effectively, I am on the whole disposed to think that subject to any comments the Gulf may have to offer we should agree to Ballantyne's present figure v .itn the moaification that the rate of Rs.75,000 should commence from the fifth year. Here, as in tne case of local refining, we are in a position of real difficulty, because we have very little l^erage on the Company, we are, it is true, making certain concessions to them, and in particular as regards Article XI of the revised Mining Lease/- 4 - Leass (power to denounce at three months' notice). But our position woula he very difficult vls-k-vls the sheikh ii tne Company were to call our bluff by withdrawing their offer and Inalcate tnat they ala not attach great Importance to tne modification of Article XI, tina subject to your observations ana to confirmation of the offer by San Francisco my own feeling is that we should do well to close, with the modification referred to above. 5. I snould be grateful for your very early comments on the points raisea in this letter, as we may expect a further communication from the Company in the icmedlate iuture ana it will be necessary to consult the Resident oefore we can give them an official reply.

Starling and myself on the uH2th July, trie possioility of their giving tiny unaertaking cibout loctil refinlne.. Tney had very regretfully come to the conclusion that this was out of the question. They haa every intention of refining locally; out for the reasons they had already given they saw great difficulty in giving any undertaking, whether to H.M.G. or to the sheikh, to. Ballantyne indicated that he would write to this effect ana that he would endeavour to state the Company's case in some little detail. (He subsequently rang up to say that he would much prefer not to write. I replied, however, that rje coula not regard the reasons given by the Company for falling to agree to local refining as satisfactory, Particularly ir^vigf of their explanation that they would liiiost certainly/; that we could not on the facts before us advise the Sheikn to accept their explanation, and that it uld De pi eferable that the Company should express themselves in writing, if they did not do so it would be necessary for us to raise the matter in writing with them. He agreed in these circumstances that it would be better to Hake a written communication). 4sked whether there was any possibility/possioility of ths Coin^ny procQeding. as 'tney hctd suggest/Bd may 'be the case, in the iramediate future with, the estaolisi'inient 01 a refinery, Mr. Ballantyne v/as reluctant to coramit himself.

I said we a 6 reed that the 10 year period should run from the date of commencement of the Liining Lease» New Article IV. Mr. Ballantyne asked that the wording of ohis article should be amended to conform to the wording ol New Article X» I pointed out to him that the ciicumstances contemplated oy the two articles were Quite different and he withdrew his suggest ion» Nov/ article V . I said we suggested the following redraft of the last part of this article; '30 long as the provisions of Bahrein Orders in Council of 1913 ana 1922 or any order in consolidation thereof or in substitution therefor or supplementary thereto remain in force'. Mr, Ballantyne did not anticipate any difficulty over this. ar ticle 711 . I confirmed that we were prepared to accept the Company's proposal as regards natural gas and that it had been agreed that the question of royalty on casing head gasolene should be further considered direct between kr. starling and Mr. Hamilton when the further information which Mr. Hamilton was obtaining from the United States was available. New/^c» ^.tticig—i_TIT. (a) I said that we were prepared defer to tae Company's view as regards tlie payment of a lump sum of ^s.10,000 to the Sheikh. (d) I said (after consultation wltn I.u. starling) that we accepted the redraft 'in every calendar year in which this lease continues in operation'. Article XI. on the understanding that a satisfactory settlement was reached on tae question of minimum royalty I said that we agreed to this article. article XIK. There was considerable discussion on this n question. I s^id we must maintain our suggestion that the article should be amended to provide that 'correct geological plans ana records shall be open to Inspection by the sheikh'. After reference to kr. starling and furtner discussion with kr. Ballantyne it was agreed that this point should again be put to the Company with a view to the Company's indicating in reply to what extent they were prepared to go in meeting our requirements. We could then consider whether their offer went sufficiently far. I said tnat the matter was not one on wiiich we were prepared to compromise having regard to precedents outside. 4 ' -;:3rcial exploitaole Quantit y and minimum royalty , to. Ballantyne said that in the light of the representations tnat uad been made to them the Company, in deference to the views expressed by H.k.G. and in the interests of smooth working with the sheikh, were prepared to make a concession on the subject of minimum royalty. They could not go so far as I had suggested, viz. Rs.30,000 for the first two years, Es.SO,000 for the following three years, and thereafter Ss.l lakh. But he and Mr. Hamilton were prepared to recommend to San Francisco on the grounds given above, 3s.oO,000 for the first two years, Ss.50,000 for the next tour/7« - 4 - foui /sars, ana Re,To,000 thereafter. I Sciici that the ilgares I haa given him represented our luinimum anu that 1 v.ouxci iia,ve to take orders on his propose,!. While appreciating trie attitude adopted oy the Company I still thought that the Government figures were the equitable minimum, m any case it seemed important that, whatever minimum was agreed, the maximum figure should come into operation at the end of 5 years.

Legal Department might care to give consideration to the wording of Aarticle XXII, that is, the Arbitration Clause, It seems to me that as it stands, the Clause is lacking in machinery; it may be that to ensure a smooth passage for Qjestions to be dealt with, it will ba necessary to incorporate a reference to the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice for the appointment of an Umpire, if the Arbitrators disagree, and the adoption of the procedure of that Court, These are merely suggestions to show what is in my mind. Would you be good enough to let me know, at your convenience, what you think about this. Yours &amp;c,, Referring to your paragraph numbered 3 - of course the whole question of modifications is open until a satisfactory settlement is reached. In the meantime, I venture to suggest that your '•laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I. (Sd) H.fl.BALLANTYHp.^. us n 19 3^. INDIA OFFICE, LONDON.

H .R. Dear I'X. Ballantyne, In continuation of our telephone conversation of this morning I write with reference to your^letter of 18th July to suggest that an Arbitration Clause on the lines attached (which follow those which have been adopted elsewhere in the Gulf) would, we think, meet the difficulties to which you alluded. I explained to you our reasons for mentioning the political Resident as the person to nominate the arbitrator or referee in the circumstances described in the Clause. 2* When you have been able to look at it we might, if you thought it desirable, discuss it. I think there would oe advantage in the addition of a clause applying English Law, as this point also is left open, not only by the present concession, but by the alternative Arbitration Clause which I now enclose. Yours sincerely, Co • Ltd •, 19, Moorgate, E.C. 2. - 1 iSUGG^T j JD ArtBlTRn.TTON CI.AU^ .

I explained that there was absolutely no substance in the ersia claim, which was only based on rery ancient listory, and that, as far as we could see, it was being pressed chiefly for its ^nuisance value' in connection with certain general negotiations which had long been proceeding between Hia Majesty's GoTernment and Persia. The Persians had indeed at one time offered to abandon the claim in return for special concessions in other matters, but this would hare meant their 'getting something for nothing'. I told Mr. Loomis that I thought that his company need not take the claim rery seriously, and he seemed quite prepared to accept this adrice. Mr. Loomis then raised the question of the 1913/14 boundary between Saudi-Arabia and the British sphere in South- -as, Arabia. He said that he hoped there would be no question of his Company encroaching on territory outside their concession. - explained to Mr. Loomis why we regarded this line as definitely binding in international law, and why it was necessary to ^iruain it as the legal basis for the diYision between Saudi Arabia on he one hand and the British sphere in South-East A rabia on the other.g ^He appeared to grasp the situation. Office. s-w.i. 20th July, 1934&lt;no £ • • 4* Mr. Loomis also mentioned the Koweit neutral zone and repeated what he had already told Mr. Warner (see E.3983), He added, however, that he saw no reason why the various oil interests ooncemed should not ^et together and reach some agreement. I said that this seemed to be an excellent plan, and i fel - sure that Sir J.Cadman would consider any proposals which Mr. Loomis would like to talk over with him. My own impression was that the various companies concerned could probably help each other in'various ways if they agreed. But I pointed out that there was already a strong United States interest in the I.P.O., in which the Gulf Oil of California already participate. 5. kr. Loomis also aeked me a good deal about Mr. Philby, about whom he seemed well informed, and told me a story about a tanker which his Company had sent from Bahrein to Japan, with a view to finding a market for Bahrein oil in the Par iSast, where the Japanese purchasere pf the oil had made difficulties about tpking delivery in view of the Persian claim to Bahrein. 6. Fr. Loomie was most, agreeable but I doubt whether he got much more information than he had already received from Lir. Warner as to our general attitude on the questions in which he is interested. On the other hand he struck me as genuinely anxious to prevent unnecessary Anglo-American friction developing in oil matters in the Middle Bast.

Katural gasoline was divided into 24 grades, and each grade was defined by its maximum vapour pressure and its rainimum percentage evaporated at 140 0 F. y?rlinff pointed out that the re/^ulatione referred to by VreHamllton seemed to indicate that the United States overnment considered that nstural gasoline should be ^ep^rately dealt with for royalty purposes and to that extent there was support for the view which the Petroleum department had expressed* f rtizjlSEi-LILyi seid thet in Bahrein vary little gas wbs tiej.n ' ijrBducad and they were trying to keep the g««- cll rntio na low ns possible.

Dear Mr. Ballantyne, Many thanks for your letter of the 10th October. 1 confirm tliat there is no objection to the two modifications referred to in paragraph 2. 3 * ABplicftion of gnf;llsh We still think that there would be considerable advantage in inserting a provision for the application of English Law. But in view of the reluctance of the Company to agree to such a provision we are prepared not to press it so long as it is expressly underdtood between the parties that in any dispute tne matter is to be determined by the arbitrators or referee, m so far as there may be no law applicable, upon principles (including procedure) of justice, equity and gooa conscience. We agree, however, that it would be d^-siraole to provide for the application of English legal ruleo of procedure uo all questions of procedure arising in connection with any arbitration pursuant to the lease. •Ballantyne, Esq., 4// Bahrein Petroleum Co. Ltd., 19, Moorgate, E.C. 2.4 - fining. As I have made clear in the various discussions which have taken place between us on tnis uiatber, the Sheiiih of Bahrein attachs very great importance to tne making of arrangements for local refining of at any rate a substantial proportion of the oil won m Bahrein, and he will I fear be much disappointed tnat tne Company are not prepared to give him any undertaking in the matter. We note, however, the views expressed on this point in your letter under reply, and will convey them to the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf for communication to the Sheikh. 5 ' • His Majesty's Government remain of opinion that the proposals which I put to you at an earlier stage for a minimum royalty of Rs..30,000 for the first two years of the mining lease, PiS.60,000 for the ne.vt tnree years, and Rs. 100,000 thereafter, represent reasonable requirement on the part of the Sheikh in the circumstances under consideration. They regret that the Company is not prepared to accept them, but note that the Company agree to a minimum royalty at the rate of Rs.75,000 per annum, to date from Ist January 1935; and appreciate thc^t tnis represents an improvement on the proposals previously put forward in the matter by the Company.^• gelec'ted area.s , Tiiank you i'or the copies of the plan shewing the area which the Company wish to take out under the mining lease. • It is possible that the other interested Departments ■would like copies for references and, ii this should be the case^, I will, if I may, write to you in a few days' time to ask if you could assist us by letting us have a few more copies, 74 - (3 note the procedure proposed in the last paragraph of your letter. Yours sincerely, J.G. LAITHWAITE.p.Z. 6322/ 1954. Dear Mr. Laithwaite i am instructed to reply to your letter P.Z.6106 of the 5th October, as follows;- ■ Lue ^ om P an y note and thank you for your concurrence m the alterations suggested and referred to in your said letter - however, as you refer to certain specific alterations which are in addition to those I mentioned to you at our meeting on the 1st October as being requested by San Francisco, I would aslc you to be good enough to confirm also that you have no objection to them. They are as follows:- (i) In tne place of the words in sub clause (a) 'any agreement to settle it in any other way' insert the words 'a settlement by agreement between the parties hereto', and (ii) Insert after the word 'appointment' in sub clause (&amp;) (i), the words 'if theretofore not voluntarily made',. I trb ^ ^u viill oe aole to agree to these alterations, decision is noted. Also noted. v;ou -^ no t, I thinl:, be any difficulty in appl^in^ English legal Rules of Procedure to the proposed Court of Arbitration and this might be very helpful, particularly if tn0 Court were set up in any place outside England. On the 0 tner hand, there would undoubtedly be confusion and difficulty ii tne laws of England generally were made applicable to the ase • lo two particular instances, one from the angle of E is excellency and the other from that of the Company ~ the Lease e_d upon tne condition that it cannot be transferred without consent/consent (Article ZIII) but this would be negatived by Section 10 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927, which seems to permit a ti^nsler 01 the Lease regardless of such a restriction; on the other hand, although the royalties are payable only three months after due date, His Excellency might well have the right to distrain upon the effects of tne CoH P aii y ln respect of royalties immediately the royalties became due: this, according to the Common Law of this Country, as modified by several particular Statutes. t„o inscances illustrate, I hope, the kind of difiioaltics i xijox both parties might be called upon to face in the event of the general application to the Lease of the highly technical and complicated English laws, a great deal of which, namely, those relating to land, are Case Law. For these reasons alone the Company venture to hope you will S e it io no deoirable to insert a provision for the application oi English Law generally to the Lease but to leave any construction of it insofar as there is no law of Bahrein applicable, t.o the ordinary principles of justice, equity and oood. conscience, -is I have indicated above, the Company would, I am sure, oo willing that a provision be inserted for the application 0 - English Law to all questions of procedure in connection witn oxij, arbitration pursuant to the Lease but as to this no doubt you will let me know, I ha-ve referred in the foregoing paragraph to the lunor modifications I mentioned a few days ago. Draft Article VII - this is the subject of a separate tter. xiOCe,.x itL-Lu.iung - this is a question to which a great ^■1 oi thought has been given by the Company in an effort to/3. to find some justification for extending to His Excellency an aosarance that the refining of oil in Bahrein in appreciable quantities will be undertaken by the Company, i- ii . i immeaiaoaly, tnen at some time in the near future, ihe Company sincerely regret that they find it impossible to gi've any assurance of this kind, for the simple reason that it would tie their hands in marketing the production of the Company's Oilfield in Bahrein. The Company's best policy at this time, in the interests both of His Excellency and of the Company, is to keep the fullest possible freedom for disposing of this oil. I say, in His Excellency's interest, advisedly, because upon the production of the oil depends the amount of the royalty over and above the minimum royalty which His Excellency will receive: shortly put, the Company feel that the greater their freedom in marketing their oil, the more tney are likely to dispose of it, with the corresponding ucnefits in the shape of royalties and profits respectively to the Sheikh and the Company. There may be in the mind of the Sheikh, an idea thab a refinery in Bahrein would bring in greater benefits to the local Community by giving work to the inhabitants i-L this is so, please let me explain that the operation of C!j refinery takes comparatively little labour. In this connection, may I also point to the fact that the ac uivities of the Company in Bahrein have already provided labour and well-being for many of the Sheikh's Subjects. In this the Company venture to share the hope of the Sheikh, namely,, that the needs of the Company will not only continue to demand the employment of His Excellency's Subjects but in ever increasing numbers.

The first is the reques&gt; contained in my letter to you of 17th August, P.z.52^/34, that Messrs.

These are; (1) -^ uds oitution oi the word ''adjudication' for 'arbitration' in the portion which follows Sub-Clause (b) ich .yoa mentioned to me on the telephone. This may not b^ ^eiy impci'tant out I do not see any advantage in the alteration. The only other Article where 'arbitration' is mentioned is in Article II. Rider B and there the phrase is 'shall be Settled by arbitration'. ^ ^) - l ^oula pi e^e x' do have the word ' save omitted from Jlause (c) because this might possibly be interpreted to mean that the Company neednot conserve their gas. If they mean 'store' I should not object to that word being substituted for 'save'. But I think the word 'produce' gives them all the protection they need from the point of view in ' n ich I understand them to use the word 'save', ^■ s of the royalty on natural gas is in respect of the gas sold, I do not think the last three lines 0' Suo-clause (c) 'nor shall the Company, etc.' are required.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, I am instructed to reply to your letter P.Z. 6224/34 of the 6th October, as follows;- (a) In the paragraph immediately following on (b) of Article VII, the retention of the word 'arbitration' in preference to 'adjudication' is agreed to by the Company. (b) As regards clause (c) of Article VII, the Company wish me to say that this clause deals with royalty only and in that connection it is essential for it to be clearly understood that the imposition of the royalty on gas does not, in turn, impose upon the Company an obligation to conserve in any shape or form any gas there may be either under ground or over ground; therefore, in the interests of clarity, the existing phrasing should stand. Furthermore, as to the last three lines of the said clause (c) beginning 'nor shall the Company', this sentence would appear to be necessary to make it clear that the principle of basing the royalty only on the gas which is sold does not, in turn, debar the Company from using any gas there maybe, in the Company's installations in the Sheikh's territories. I trust the foregoing makes the Company's position perfectly clear, namely, that in dealing with the question of and agreeing to a royalty on any natural gas which may be sold, they are desirous of avoiding the introduction of the subject of the conservation of gas, a subject, I am told, extremely wide and technical. ^ithwaite, Esq., -ia Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.

Dear Laitliwaite, Bahrein. iv^ y« r ith further reference to my letter of the 5th October regarding the revised Article VII of the Draft I lining Lease, Mr. Hamilton, at your suggestion, has had a talk with me about the proposed deletion of the v. f ord n saYe :; in sub clause (c). He points out that this v;ord is used in the same sense as in line 1 of sub clause (a) that the Company have every intention of conserving their gas, bat that to press the deletion of this word would involve a further commission to San Francisco. I suggested he might write us a letter explaining what he had told me but hu said that if this letter v ;ere to be regarded as an interpretation of what is in the lease it would require the authority of their Head Office. As I appreciate that it is now desirable to get these negotiations completed I do not consider that the point is so important as to have it raised with San Francisco and in these circumstances I do not press it.

Please refer to Articles 9 and 10 of lease which cover any stoppage of drilling. I understand that Company would on no account hand over geological information if they merely stopped production before 1940 as this stoppage is often good oil field practice. r roduction of 1600 tons a day would fill storage tanks in 40 days. Should no ship arrive production would then have to be stopped. At present most wells are closed down owing to lack of a market.
