We feel that the suggestion is a good one, as it would help to give the more important people in the Gulf the feeling that they were being remembered in London; at the moment we have all too little publicity for your part of the world. I should be glad if you wrould examine the question and see if it would be practicable to have the news summary written by a local journalist as suggested (or would Mary Galloway take it on?') The B.B.C. are anxious to start the transmission as soon as possible, and I should be grateful for an early reply; the B.B.C. letter enclosed reached me only a day or two ago. Yours sincerely, (SGD.) L.P.DONALDGOh. The Hontble Lieut.-Col. w.F. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.F., HPG.warn Listeners will now hear the weekly Newsletter from our special correspondent in Cairo. . 4.9.46. hi-Lfb-u-hiixlt - Cry. / I i/ * . f ' W. J o I • / 7 / - P week ago Cairo celebrated Ramadan Bairam, and all Government departments and commercial and industrial establishments were closed for the occasion. In spite of the shortage of white flour, the traditional Bairam cakes were served in almost every house, and the colourful toy balloons which disappeared during the Nar were seen again in the hands of children on the streets of Cairo. It was noticed that new clothes e:dorned most of the girls but few of the boys this year, the reason being that silk material suitable for girls was available in the shops at reasonable prices, whereas suits for boys are still most expensive, 'f Amidst the mirth of the Id many people felt that something was missing. That was the morning and evening papers, which were suspended during the Bairam holidays. It was only on the third day of Bairam that they re-appeared. News of the Nile flood is still an important item. For the first time for weeks the level has dropped, but the threat is by no means over, and pre cautions are still being taken to protect the river banks. In Upper Egypt the water has covered a number of villages, but although houses were damaged there have been no casualties. During the Id no holiday was granted to those responsible for flood precautions. Irrigation officials, detachments of the /rmy, and Government engineers are stationed at the Barrage to protect the district, idi In addition to the Nile flood, the two other important topics of the moment are the position of the negotiations for a revised Treaty, and the possibility of changes in the Cabinet, although the Anglo-Fgyptian negotiations to all outward appearances came to a stand still during the Bairam holidays, it was reported by political observers that there was considerable activity behind the scenes end among political parties. One thing which has been puzzling the public during the week is that the Wafd at its last meeting announced that it would issue a statement, but that this has not been done. It is now believed that the Wafd has decided to postpone its statement because of some new development in the situation regarding the Treaty; or else that in view of the impending changes in the Cabinet, the Party does not think it advisable to commit itself to a fixed policy. Regarding Cabinet changes, there are all sorts of conflicting rumours and speculation in the Press as to why changes are to take place and as to the attitude of each political Party to the prospect. One thing is certain, however, and that is that no change will take place before the return of H.-' r . the King from his trip to Cyprus. (?l Thus it has been a week of cakes and politics. People have eaten their cakes and exchanged congratulations on the occasion of the Id. Politics seem to be a little uncertain, but everybody is hoping for some good news soon, so that they may exchange congratulations again.16-10-46. Cairo ijkwSufcT'rij L .O&amp; -X. - The following is the Newsletter sent us this week by our Middle Fast Office in Ceiro. Much has been said about politics this week, and the News Bulletins have already communicated to listeners the general trend of thought and the various developments in the situation. It is not intended to repeat here an account of the week*s events, but it may be worth while reminding listeners that during the last few days. The Wafd has issued its most important and most significant manifesto, setting out in detail its policy and views. The Prime Minister replied to this at Tanta in an outstanding political speech lasting for an hour and a half. The speech was broadcast at the time by the Egyptian State Broadcasting Company, and was repeated the same evening. .Also this week, H.F. Sidky Pasha has made his final decisions about leaving for London to see Mr. Bevin. Although the Press began by attacking the purpose of that visit, most of the leading papers now seem to think it may be useful. Fuad Al-awwsl University has postponed the beginning of its new term until after the Corban Bairam holiday, and it is generally believed that this step has been taken in order to avoid student troubles during the Prime Ministers absence in London, yi Egyptians in general, and Cairenes in particular, are fond of politics, and it is no rare thing to see them discussing political affairs in trams, cafes and restaurants; at the same time, they are also fond of art and artistic movements. With the advent of winter, places like Ernad El-Peen Street have started to revive, and a pre-war atmosphere can now be seen and felt. Thanks to the thriving new film industry in Egypt, Egyptian films have invaded the market, and over ninety per cent of the cinemas in Cairo are now showing these films. Egyptian stars are now adopting the fashion of attending their films in person, and they are always welcomed end cheered by the public. Entrance fees on such occasions are usually increased. ,2 Studio Misr, one of the main film companies in Egypt, has started experiments with a view to producing films in technicolour, and the fruit of these efforts has been seen by the public during the week in the form of *a short film showing the Pyramids, the Sphinx, the famous Mena House Hotel, and Miss Hour p1-Houda, the famous singer and actress, having tea in the studio gardens. It is generally felt by the public that the experiments have resulted in success, and although the production of techni- colour films may be a bit expensive, it is worth while pursuing the scheme. Talking about the cinema, listeners may be interested to know that a new film by .Abdul Wahhab and Hour Al-Houda is expected shortly, and an immense publicity campaign in preparation for it is now being carried out. The film is entitled ”1 am not an Angel' (Lastu malakan). Like the rest of Abdul Wahhabis films, it is expected that it will be shown in a number of Arab countries concurrently with its release in Cairo.51/59 Telegram G.T,C.

Hay, C.a. I. , Lf. T.5«, political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.PERSIAN GULF NEWSLETTER. This has been an eventful month in the Persian Gulf during which His Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Saud paid a welcome and long anticipated visit to its shores. On 23rd January His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, Ruler of Bahrain, accompanied by his uncles Shaikhs Mohammed and Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, visited King Abdul Aziz near Al Khobar. The Bahrain party were richly entertained with true Arab hospitality at Damraara. Customary presents were exchanged and His Highness returned to Bahrain on 25th January by sea. Further news of the Al Khalifah is that at the end of his vacation Hamad bin Mohammed, nephew of the Shaikh of Bahrain, returned to Beirut where he, like many other young Arabs, is studying at the American University. on the sea-shore. By the way it is interesting that in a South Easterly direction he has a view of uninter rupted sea, the nearest land being the Panama Canal, half way round the world. A mournful note is struck by the passing of the flying-boat service which connected Bahrain and Sharjah with Basra, Cairo and Karachi. The last boat flew up the Gulf on January 14th. This service will be sorely missed since all classes of society, even the desert Arab, had come to rely upon it. Talking about the Arab from the remoter parts of the Gulf, Shaikh Mani bin Rashid, cousin of Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, died on January 10th. Dubai bazaar closed for three days in mourning. Inci dentally the shia community of Bahrain observed 3 days mourning for the death of Shaikh Abul Hassan, the Grand Mejtahid of Najaf. The whole area of the Gulf has been blessed with rain so badly needed to make the desert grass sprout. Good rain fell on two occasions in Kuwait which will not only give promise of good grazing, but will make that sometime arid waste blossom with miles of blue and red flowers. In Muscat the rain which fell in the hinterland will replenish the spring and water courses but was insufficient to sweeten the wells in the towns of Muscat and MUttrah. A storm hit Bahrain on the night of January 8 th and for half an hour it poured, discpvering unexpected leaks in the roofs of houses and doing some damage to property and to the cargo of some of the sailing craft which the wind overturned; trees were blown down and rain lay in puddles in the streets and the desert for days. By the time it reached the Sahil Oman the storm had to some extent blown itself out, and the rain, though heavy, only lasted some 15 minutes. it was suffi cient, however, to turn the desert green - and camels at least profitted. 1 There has been no rain since. Banrain welcomed home during the month the last of the Haj pilgrims. They were travellers in the old arrived at News from Muscat is that the Bultan has/ka&amp;kxbtix aapxgakx&amp;aat salalah in his province of Dhofar where he will spend the next few months in his beautiful palace /fashioned...fashioned style who either were not rich enough or too pious to avail themselves of the most modern way of making the pilgrimage. This is by air and the introduction of this means of transport resulted in a greater number of pilgrims from Bahrain than usual. January was a good month for sport. His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait has made several hawKing expeditions in the distant- parts of his territory and the Shaikh of Bahrain has also been enjoying the sport. He spent four days in the middle of the month hunting from a lodge at Mattalah. Football, cricket and hockey are all enjoying their cold-weather vogue. The most interesting feature was the football match between a Bahrain Football XI and one from Saudi Arabia. Tremendous excitement was aroused and at least a thousand spectators were present. Amongst them JtkasR were the Shaikh of Bahrain axath and his uncles. The winners were the Manama team who beat their opponents by 3 goals to two, and after the match the Shaikh of Bahrain presented them with silver medals he had had specially struck in Bahrain. At Beit al Falaj near Muscat, His Highness’ Levies scored a smashing victory in a hockey match over a team from H.M.S. 'Wildgoose' who was visiting Muscat, beating them seven to nil.Printed in England. CABLE AND WIRELESS LIMITED (INCORPORATED IN ENGLAND) Telephone No. SOM IN REPLY REFER TO no....117/44 MANAMA.

Olver, Esq., Secretary to the Hon'ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain NS.PERSIAN GULF NEWSLETTER . While England has been snow bound and suffering from the hardships of severe cold the Persian Gulf has received the blessings of good rain along its whole shores. This is so important to the prospects of the year’s weather and grazing that we do not apologise for opening our letter with this subject. Everywhere it means grazing for the camels and flocks and in Muscat it means the filling of the reservoirs, the water from which filters through the sub-soil insuring sweet and full wells for the hot weather. Starting from the north of the Gulf the news this month is of the anniversary of the accession of His Highness Shaikh Ahmed As Subah of Kuwait. Kuwait celebrated the 26th anniversary on the 23rd February, and the day was observed as a public holiday. His Highness sitting in open Majlis. In the evening the Safat was thronged with Kuwaitis and foreigners who watched the traditional Arab dancing. The rhythmic beating of the drums, swaying of feet and waving of swords and rifles in the air makes spectator and dancer alike thrill with the measure of the dance. His Highness was fortunate in that H.M.S. 'Glasgow', Flagship of the East Indies Station visited Kuwait during the celebration. The Commander-in-chief welcomed His Highness Shaikh Ahmed on board and also a number of Kuwaiti school boys were overjoyed at being shown round the ship. /Schoolboys....Schoolboys in Bahrain also had a special treat this month when a holiday camp was set up on Hawar Island for a few days. The boys loved the sea trip to % • this outlying islet with its high cliffs, sandy shores and long sand spit with bathing beaches on both sides of the Hawar’s tail. Some of the teachers went abroad and visited Dhahran while others spent the spring holi days quietly at home. These holidays were heralded by a welcome tour of the schools by His Highness Shaikh Salman Al Khalifah. He was accompanied by many notables. His Highness Shaikh Salman of Bahrain also visited the Commander-in-chief on board H.M.S. ’’Glasgow', and he and his uncles together with *** were entertained by Sir Arthur.palliser. The more agile members of the fiatJt party were shown right up to the bridge. It is a big climb on that lovely ship. While we are thinking in terms of the sea, Bahrain had a reminder of the last war when two bombs which had fallen into a coke dump during an air-raid were lifted by a mechanical grab buried in the coke. One was dis covered at the hold of the ship and the other in the barge. Fortunately no damage was done. We very much regret the death on February 17th of Shaikhah Hussah, the late wife of Said bin Maktura, the Ruler of Dubai. She was a lady of outstanding character and will be sadly missed in Dubai. The Shaikh, accompanied by his son Khalifa, visited Has al Khaimah on his way to Bakhah where he has gone to condole with his sister-in-law, Bakha would appear to be as out of the way as possible evenJ~- -3- for the Gulf, tucked in, as it is, under the high black mountains of the Musandam peninsula which rise almost sheer out of the sea. In fact it is a flourishing little town whose sons travel as far afield as Gulf boats go, and it has much contact with foreign shipping as it is a port of call where boats can obtain sweet water having entered the Gulf through the straits of Hormuz. By the way we hope that the work on the clearing of the springs at Khitt between Has al Khaimah and Dhaid is progressing. These springs have the clearest warm water and the cleaning of them is not only a work of charity for tne water is said to have medicinal properties, but there is also a more tangible benefit since date cul tivation will be extended in the region. A stroll in the streets of the main towns of the Gulf is cheering recreation. New motor cars are arriving for the richer people and the less fortunate are able to spend their money in the well filled shops of the bazaars. Merchandise is arriving from all over the world, cottons from England, silks from China, food delicacies from Australia and tools from America. All have eager buyers wishing the share in the slow return to prosperity. NS.OFFICE OF THE POLITICAL RESIDENT PERSIAN GULF, D .Q.No.C/80. CAI. P, KUWAIT, the 22nd March 1947.

DatePERSIAN GTTLF m* 1 3LET!?m. ■HMk—1 For thousands of years the Persian Gulf has been an important line of communication between India and the west and the question of communications still looms very large in the minds of the peoples who inhabit its shores. It was, therefore, with great pleasure that the people of the Gulf welcomed the appearance of the British India Steam Navigation company’s new ship, the M.S. 'BUVp.A” which made her maiden voyage in the Gulf during the month. At each port of call leading personalitics were entertained in the new ship, and much admiration was displayed for its fittings and accommodation which contrast so favourably with those of the old veterans like the Barjora whose keels have ploughed the waters of the Gulf for nearly rorty years. These same waters of the Gulf are now seen at their i best in the clear light of the Middle Eastern spring. The beginning of the month of March was marked by storms and occasional rain alternating with clear weather and xs-® a cool fresh wind from the north. This is the time when the gardens in Bahrain and 'discat and the desert in Kuwait are at their best. In the garden, the colours of the flowers make glad the eye ; while birds fill the air with their song. The deserts around Kuwait are green as far as the eye can see, and the air is sweet with the scent of desert plants. Led by Bis Highness Shaikh Ahmed As Subah, the Shaikhs, merchants and otVier notables of Kuwait moved out of the town to occupy their houses built along the coast to the south. During his visit the T?or»ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and his family, and the political Agent, Kuwait, camped out in the desert some fifty miles from Kuwait, and were entertained by Shaikh Abdullah A1 Mubarak As Subah. Their visit was greatly enjoyed /and....- 2 - and they had good sport. In Kuwait town itself much building and improvement is now going on. A new Boys f School is going up fast and the Government Hospital is nearing completion. The new market is now ready and the 60 foot wide road rrom the sea to the Safat is shortly to he begun. in Bahrain, too, the Ruler, His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah, has been enjoying the spring weather on a hunting trip at the south end of the island. Of the Trucial Coast Rulers, Shaikh Said bin 'aktum of Dubai is on a hunting trip in Qishm Island. There have been quite a number of visitors to Bahrain during the month. The Right Reverend H.w. Stewart, Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem, stayed here and was received by His Highness. Mr. Storey Wilson, one of the Directors of Holloway Brothers, and Mr. Beeby Thompson, well-known water engineer visited Bahrain in connection with the H a riama Town Water Scheme which is being carried out for the Bahrain Government by Holloway Brothers. We regret to report the death in Beirut of Mohaaned Yateem, at one time a well known figure in the Gulf. He was connected with Major Holmes who was a prominent figure in the early oil negotiations and whose death in England also occurred a short while ago. Mohammed ^ateam was an interpreter with the British Forces during their campaign in ’Iraq in the 1914-1B war, and he was taken prisoner by the Turks. A native of Bahrain, he lived for some years in Damascus. He was the uncle of Hussain v ateem, a prominent Bahrain merchant. 1 ' WS.CONFIDENTIAL . political Agency, Bahrain, No - 0/449 • The 10th April,-47: The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compli ments to: The Hon'ble the political Resident i 2- ? in the Persian Oulf, Bahrain, and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document(s).

First place must be given to the Spring Race Meeting held at Bahrain on the 11th of April. His Highness the Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah, T rs. Hay,/wife of the Hon’ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the political Agent, Bahrain, Hiss Hay and Hr. Russell Brown, Manager of the Bahrain petroleum Company, were amongst those present. There were also a large number of visitors from other States and Saudi Arabia while very many of the notables and merchants of Bahrain and large crowds of all classes were also present. The day was fine and six keenly contested races were watched with great enjoyment by the large crowds. The annual school sports both in Bahrain and Kuwait, and the Police Sports in Bahrain were also held during this month, in Bahrain, the school events included displays of physical drill, trick cycling and a staff donkey race. Isa al Khalifa, n he nuler and shaikh Abdullah bin txxxx* Education sinister, were present, in Kuwait, the sports were witnessed by Shaikhs Abdulla al f.oibarak and Abdulla al Jabir as also many other members of the al Subah and leading citizens of the town. The general physique of the boys was much admired and the excellent display of Swedish Grill by the Mubaraklyeh School was carried out with precision and energy. The Political Agent and the Kuwait Oil Company ouch contributed gold watches as prizes. Other news from Kuwait is that many of its ocean going booms (sailing boats) have returned from India, while those on the route from Zanzibar have left though have not yet /arrived— arrived from Muscat, their first port of call. These booms \ are a distinctive feature of Kuwait and would, indeed, be distinctive in any part of the world because, together with the junks (sailing ships) of China, they are almost the last ocean going sailing ships in trade. In Kuwait alone their beautifully shaped hulls are fashioned and driven down literally through the walls of the shipyards to the sea. For untold centuries, Kuwaiti sailors have sailed their fine ships down, to Zanzibar and India in the autumn of each year on the wind of the north-west monsoon, and have sailed them back again in spring with the first movements of the south-west monsoon. In addition to the cargoes of their owners, each of the crew carries his own trading chest, thus maincaining the old tradition of individual trading by sailors. From the desert at Kuwait to the south and north comes news of considerable hatchings of locusts which were success ively dealt with by a detachment of the Middle Fast Anti-Locust Unit, This is the traditional time of the year for marriages in the Gulf States, and on almost any evening one meets marriage processions with the bridegroom mounted on a mare surrounded by dancers and drummers bearing witness to the occasion of rejoicing. Of marriages amongst prominent people must be mentioned that of Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zaid, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and, in Bahrain, of shaikh Abdulla, son of | Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman who is a step brother and cousin of Bis Highness the Ruler. During this month the Tfon^le the political Resident and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, paid a visit to His Highness the Sultan of r/uscat at Salalah in the province of Dhofar. , This lovely place situated on the south-west coast /of. £•&gt;© of Lhe Arabian peninsula is much favoured by His Highness the sultan. It is bordered by seas which crash in never ending breakers on dazzling white sands fringed by cocoanut palms beyond which in the monsoon weather miles of green grass stretch to the mountains of the province8/43.

Britagent i — ■PEHJIAr GULF NEWSLETTER The most striking news in the Gulf during the month of May was the visit of the American Navy to the sheikhdoms of Bahrain and Kuwait and to the Sultanate of ynascat. The U.S.S. ’’Toledo'* - a new heavy cruiser - arrived at Bahrain on the 10th of May and formal calls were exchanged between its Captain, the Hon’ble the political Resident, the senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, and the political Agent, Bahrain, On the next day, Admiral R.I. Connolly, United States Naval Commander in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, and Admiral R. Glover,«£ and their respective staffs arrived at Muharraq, the airport of Bahrain, in a United States Naval aircraft. They were entertained to a large dinner party by His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifa on that i evening. The U.S.S. ’’Toledo'’ was visited by many people from Bahrain who found great interest in seeing this fine warship and were pleasantly entertained on board. Kuwait was visited by the United States Destroyer ”HANLAN R. DICKSON” which arrived there on May 12. Official calls were exchanged between the Commanding Officer, His Highness the Shaikh and the political Agent. The U.S. Destroyer ’’HYMAN” visited Muscat and stayed there for four days. The ship’s officers were entertained by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and by His Highness the Sultan's representative Saiyid Shihab. These visits of American warships to the Gulf are also interesting as no American ship has visited Muscat for fifty /years....- 2 - years, and there is no record of any American warship having ever visited Bahrain or Kuwait.

The T Iraqi Airways also run a thrice-weekly service between Basra and Kuwait. The pearl industry of the Persian Gulf has been famous for thousands of years. In this month, the majority of the pearling fleets from Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the other states left for the oyster banks. The number of boats is less than that which went out. last year as a result of the falling off in the demand for pearls from India due to the disturbances in that country. in Kuwait Bis Highness Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir as Subah and his family returned to Dasman palace from Huwelli on the evening of the 17th of May, and the other members of the Al Subah family returned to town from their country houses about the same time.

From Kuwait to the entry to the Gulf great consternation was caused on the Arab coast by reports from India that the Government there had imposed a ban on the entry of precious stones into that country and that this included pearls which, for thousands of years, have been the most precious and paying export from the Gulf States. Fortunately, it was later learnt that the ban had been raised for three months, and it is hoped that this news will be officially confirmed. NS.JL CONFIDENTIAL . / v . POLITICAL AGENCY, Bi.LAAIN.

The cholera epidemic which we mentioned in last month’s newsletter caused considerable trouble as two suspected cases were found at Dubai and the place declared infected. No further suspected cases occurred however, and Dubai was declared free from infection on the 26th of November. 3ir Firoz Khan Noon, the Pakistan Envoy to the Islamic States, arrived in Bahrain by air from Saudi Arabia on the 21st of November and stayed there for some days. He met the [on’ble the political Resident and His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain.

My dear Hay, We discussed recently with reperesentatives of the B.B.C. and interested Government Departments the relation of the B.B.C. 1 s Arabic Service to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. 2. It appears that Bhe B.B.C. get few news items of interest from the Gulf, mainly because the news agencies do not consider it worth their while to appoint local representatives there. The Public Relations Officer*s Monthly News Letter is useful, but the B.B.C. say it is apt to be rather late in arriving (perhaps for unavoidable reasons) and that this somewhat detracts from its value. We promised to ask you to see whether it would be possible to do anything to ensure prompter despatch in future. It was also suggested that it might help if the various Political Agents were to g telegraph to the P.R.O. regularly any items of general news interest for inclusion in the Monthly Letter. The B.B.C. are always glad to receive any criticisms or suggestions from the Gulf in regard to their Arabic Service. In this connection we wonderec whether it might be useful to revive the idea (which I believe operated during the war) of having listening committees' of local residents who could give their own ciriticisms. Perhaps you would consider this. Clearly it is desirable that such committees should be representative of the listening public if their views are to be of much help. 3. A further suggestion was made that the Arabic Service (or possibly the Home Service) might produce some feature programme dealing with the activities of the oil companies (the Kuwait Oil Company was mentioned in particular). Such a feature might emphaiise the social $ improvements following in the train of oil development and might also make some play with the theme of Anglo-American co-operation. It was thought that the oil companies would probably welcome th: idea. It would be necessary, no doubt, for a representative of the B.B.C. to visit the Gilf if such a programme were to be produced, and the B.B.C. undertook to go into the matter further. 4. We should be glad to have any comments and suggest ions you may care to offer on the above ideas, and on the general subject of making the Arabic Service more attractive and interesting for listeners in the Gulf. Yours sincerely, Sd/- E.P. Donaldson. Jjt.Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Persian Gulf Resident, BAHRAND.O. Ho. C/1214 POLITICAL AGEMCY BAHi: AIN.

I enclose herewith a statement showing the delays in the dispatch of the newsletters. As you will see, they were not too bad. I can only speak for the several which I composed myself, and some times they were due to delay in the receipt of the news from the other two Agencies, some times to ray being away on the days when they should have been composed, and some times to pressure of other work. I shall try to do better in future. The political Agents do telegraph the news each month for inclusion in the letter by me. It might be useful to have ''listening committees', and I shall go into the idea when I have time. Similarly, I shall consult the Oil Companies about Mr. Donaldson's suggestion in his paragraph 3.

The idea at the back of my mind had been that the compiler of the final Persian Gulf News letter might exercise some sort of general control over the material to be included and consequently I was not strict in ray selection as I should have been. On second thoughts, however, I agree that the P.A.

The Persian Gulf Newsletter in which some or all of the Muscat items are included is supposed to be with the B.B.C. for broadcasting by the second Monday of each month; they have indeed complained that it is often late, and the reason for this has some times been that the news items telegrams from other posts arrive late in Bahrain. If, therefore, any Muscat news of the month is to be in cluded in the Newsletter for that month, it is essential that it reaches here six days before the second Monday of the Month, If then you want any special items certainly included, please telegraph them six clear days before the second Monday of each month. Other items which you^ like included but do not depend for their news value on being published as soon as possible could be sent by bag. 2.
