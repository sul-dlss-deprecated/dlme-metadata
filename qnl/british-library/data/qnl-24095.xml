Would it be possible for us to have information on the follow ing points: .rvre we correct in stating that the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act has not been actually applied to Bahrein but is merely used as a guide between your office and ourselves in reaching solutions of problems which arise? / t ' ' 1 / / ~ //' N^l- k* / A We understand there is nothing in existence in Bahrein in the nature of a Workmen's Compensation .act. Is this correct? 3. We understand that, according to the Bahrein Order in Council 1913, the Political Agent would decide a dispute as between two parties in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure and other Indian Enactments relating to the Administration of Civil Justice, the Political Agent taking the status of a District Judge of the Presi dency of Bombay. We assume this would be true if both parties were British subjects. For instance, the Company on the one hand and the Indian (in the case of Chowdhury) on the other hand. ^ 4. Is there an appeal from the Political Agent's court to that of the Political Resident? 5. Is it within the power of either party to direct that the suit will be determined in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure (in India) and other Enactments made applicable to Bahrein, that is, so far as locsl conditionp permit, and subject always to local customs or usage. 6. Would it be possible for us to secure copies of all laws which apply to Bahrein, especially those as set out in the Order in Bahrein Council. 1913?

I think that in reply to your question 3 (and in amplification of the reply in paragraph 1 above), it might simplify natters for your Company if I were to explain briefly the juridical position in Bahrain, 3. . The procedure to be followed and the law to be applied in any legal proceedings. Civil or Criminal, is laid down in the Bahrain Order-in-Coimcil, 1913 with its attendant King^s Regulations. 4. fill. Briefly:- (a) if both parties are foreiyaers the case is tried in the Polilical Agents Court, (b) if both parties are Bahnin subjects, the case is tried in the Bahrain Courts, (C)(o) if thu plainfcifl is a foroi^jrier and tho accused a Bahrain subjoct, the caj^u iu tried in tho Joinu Court (the Shaikh and the Political Agent f or one of tho Shaikh^ rolationa and the Indian Assi&amp;tant sitting together), and (d) if the plaintiff is a Bahrain subiect and the accused is a foreigner, tno case is tried (by arm^goniont vath the Shailih) in tue Political Agents Court (instead of the Joint Court}* 5m The law applied in the Political Agent's Court is that provided for in tho Bahrain Ordei&gt;in-Uouncil (v /iiich applies certain Indian Acts to Bahrain) and its attendant Kings ^ogultxtions. provision is made for the application of the customary la\7 of Bahrain, where it does not conflict with the provisions of the Ordei^in-Oouiioi !• The law applied in tho Joint Court is Bahrain oustoaary law, but the Political Ag^nt is naturally bound by the principles of British justice* &amp;• In reply to the en^uiiy regarding an individual case in your paragraph 3, if both parties to a criminal case or civil suit are British subjects, the matter is tried (or heard) by the Political Agones Court (or his subordinate Courts, that is to say, the Court of the Assistant political Ag^int, who exercises the powers of a First Class Magistrate and Subordinate .

Dear Sir, With reference to paragraph 1 of my letter No.2236-28/2 dated the 18th December 1935, I would explain that, although it is not within the power of either party to direct the procedure by which a suit shall be deteimined. Sections 36 and 37 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council lays down that rT the Political Agent shall enquire from the several parties whether they desire that proceedings shall be instituted in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure and the Indian enactments made applicable to Bahrein, or in accordance with local usage.' If then, 'any of the several parties desire that the suit shall be determined in accordance with the Code of Civil procedure and other enactments made applicable to Bahrein, the District Court shall forthwith proceed to decide the suit in accordance with the provisions of such enactments, as far as local conditions permit.' Section 37 provides for the District Court to refer/-refer matters to local bodies in certain cases.

In 1931, 1 ajor Prior suggested the application of the Indian Vorkmen's Compensation Act (VTII of 1923) to Bahrain, hut I deprecated the application of this complicated Act and eventually an undertaking was obtained from the Chief Local Kepresentative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company, that pending a permanent agreement the Company would dispose of claims for ac ?ident compensation on the lines of the Indian ■orkmen's Compensation Act of 1925, and that in the event of disagreement the Political Agent, Bahrain, would act as arbitrator. In this connection see correspondence ending with 1 ajor Prior's letter No. 943 dated the 2nd August 1931. 2. The position as regards compensation for injury hy accident is, therefore, satisfactory. There remains however, the general question of the engagement, terms and conditions of service of Indian labour employed 'by the Company and to what extent these comply with the provisions of the Indian Emigration Act (VII of 1922). The art ivThe Labour Roster of the Gomj^any aateci the 1st Octoher 1935 shows 33 skilled and 12 semi-skilled Indian employees, all of whom, if recruited in India, appear to he affected hy the provisions of the Act ( vide Section 2 and Chapters IV and VI thereof), ana with the erection of the refinery, the number is likely to increase. 3. The Boster does not show any unskilled Indian labour, and it is unlikely that the Company will require to import unskilled Indian Labour. It may 'be noted, however, that under Section 10 (l) of the Indian ^migrption Act, the emigration of unskilled Indian labour to Bahrain would be unlawful until the Govern ment of India publish a notification rendering it lawful. 4. i t is not known ho i v. the Company recruit their Indian skilled employees. Do they do it through an agent in India? If so, and if he do^s not comply with the provisions of the Indian Emigration Act he would, of course, be liable to be proceeded against by the Local Government in India. If the Company engage them locally, i.e. in Bahrain, the provisions of the Act would not apply. 5. In the case of Indian and British protected skilled labour recruited locally it is desirable that a proper form of contract should be entered into, setting forth clearly the rights and liabilities of both parties, including the point of compensation dealt with in the correspondence with i~ajor Prior referred to in paragraph 1 above. This will minimise the possibil ty of suits'being brought in the Agency Courts for breach'breach of contract, and if they are 'brought the Court has definite material on which to. come to a decision. 6. I enclose, for your information, a copy of the forms of agreement used for Indian clerks and artisans recruited 'by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Is this, • in your opinion, suitable for Bahrain? There is no need for -an arbitration clause as any employee could file a suit for 'breach of contract in the Agency Courts. Moreover, the only suitable arbitrator would be either the Political Agent, or the Assistant lolitical igent, and if either party refused to accept the arbitral award the case would then have to be tried before one of these officers in their judicial capacity, which vould be un desirable. It is likely that any form of contract fixed for Bahrain will have to be submitted for the approval of the Government of India. 7, It is possible that, in order to avoid conforming to requirements in the case of Indian labour, the Company might instead recruit only foreign labour, such as Persians, Iraqis, etcetera. This would contravene Article XYII of the lining Lease, and any tendency in that direction should be checked. It could be pointed out to the Company that such foreign labour v.ould be equally entitled as Indian, to sue the Company in the Agency Courts for breach of contract, and it is aesirable for them also to have proper contracts. 3. It is assumed that the American and British employees of the Company are engaged on proper forms of contract. We need not, therefore, take up their■ -4- |V case 'beyond noting that they have the right to sue the Company in the Agency Courts for 'breach of contract. 9. The interests of Bahraini labour employed hy the Company are not our- concern ('beyond acting as a channel of communication and giving our good offices to the State) and must 'be looked after hy the Bahrain Government 10. Proper contracts for the unskilled labour employed 'by the Company Vvould not 'be practicable and are not necessary. As far as compensation for injuries is con cerned they are covered by the agreement referred to in paragraph 1 above. The only class of unskilled labour regarding which difficulty might arise are Indians recruited in India and, as pointed out in paragraph 3 above, emigration of such labour to Bahrain is unlikely and is at present unlav,ful. 11. To sum up: (a) Indian skilled labour recruited in Inaia; This class, if the provisions of the Indian ^migration Act are complied vith, will iuso facto be in possession of a contract on which they can sue in the Agency Courts. ItO Indian and British protected skilled labour recruited in Bahrain: This class should also be provided with a suitable contract, viae paragraph 4 above, on which they can sue in the Agency Courts. (c) American and British employees are presumed to have proper contracts. :!1 th regard to other foreignOi p i 12. foreign skilled labour, such, as Iraqis ana Persians: as this class also has the li^ht to sue the Company in the Agency Courts, they should also he, and presumably are, in possession of contracts. (d) Bahrain subjects: It is for the Bahrain G-overn- ment to safe-guard the interests of this class and we are not concerned 'beycnc affording our good offices. (e) Contracts are unnecessary in the case of un skilled labour. (f) The agreement with the Company regarding com pensation for injury referred to in paragraph 1 above covers all classes of labour, skilled and unskilled. Please let me have your views. 3d.

Dear Sir; I am quoting below the contents of a letter received by The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited from the local office of The Meso potamia Persia Corporation Limited, who in turn are quoting from a letter received from their Baghdad office, all of which is in regard to the hiring of workmen thru the Iraq Government office for The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited by Mr, M.H. Bush, who has recently returned to Bahrein. •'Reference the work carried out by our Baghdad office in getting workmen engaged by Mr. Bush thru the Iraq Government office con cerned in the issue of Census Certificates and Passports, our Baghdad office in their letter to us No.BS/32 of the 7th inst, write as under : ^n connection with the visaing of passports for Bahrein, we are required to fill up a fonn for each man, and this form contains the following guarantee: (1) I hereby make myself personnaly responsible both for the good behaviour of the applicant whilst he (she) is within the territory named in his (her) application on the reverse, and also for his (her) maintenance in that territory. (2) I further undertake to pay the expenses of his (her) return to Iraq in the event of him (her) being required to leave that territory by the competent authorities. So far, and in order not to delay the proceedings, we have signed a guarantee for each man sent to Bahrein, but for our record purposes we shall be glad if you will obtain a formal letter from the Bahrein Oil Company undertaking to indemnify us in respect of these guarantees.*''We shall, therefore, be glad if you will be good enough to let us haye the required letter for forwarding to our Baghdad Office.' In regard to guarantee (1): The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited are not in a position to make themselyes personally res ponsible for the good behaviour and maintenance of any applicant for employment other than to return him to his native country should such action be necessary, and I am writing to you to determine if there is not some other way that such matters might be handled. In other words, could not some other fonn of guarantee be given by Mespers which would be equally as satisfactory to the Iraq Govern ment office? Will you please advise. The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited have written Mespers stating that they would assume the responsibility in the case of those employees hired in Iraq thru the Iraq Government Office who have already arrived in Bahrein. In regard to guarantee (2), The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited will undertake to pay return transportation on all employees whom they may engage in foreign countries. Yours very truly, d.W. R.

Bunk House. ~ Two persons are allotted to each room, there being six rooms. They appear comfortable and not overcrowded. A bath and a water closet has been provided for them in the building. 2. The Old Office.^ The Old Office houses twenty-two men. Two large rooms in the office appear overcrowded. The remainder have sufficient space. Baths and W.Cs are provided in the building. 3. Six Nisson Huts.-* Four people live in each Nisson hut. The space appears adequate. W.Cs, and baths are provided in each hut. Three extra W.C. seats and two bathing compartments are provided in the bath house. The W.Cs are of the flush type being connected to septic tank^, the whole system being in line with the most modem sanitary standards. The Kitchen.- Food for the employees of the company living in the old camp is prepared in the camp kitchen. The conditions under which the food is prepared are ideal. The servants are clean in person and are from time to time examined for infectious and contagious disease. They are provided washing compartments, and are encourage to be cleanly in habits and person. In the New Camp the employees are housed in : 1. Bunk Houses, Old Type. 2. Bunk Houses, New Type. 3. Married quarters, which have been turned over to house unmarried men. P.T.Oo- 2 - ti 1&gt; Bunk Houses«Old Type &gt;- Each room has two occupants. There is slight overcrowding in these Bunk houses. W.Cs and baths are provided in each building. 2. Bunk Houses^ New Type.- The first of these has recently been occupied and houses fourteen men. This type is far in advance of the old type, and under normal conditions will accommodate twelve persons. 3. Married Quarters.- One married quarter has been converted to the use of unmarried men. Five men in the hall and dining room appear overcrowded. The Kitchen.- As at the Old Camp, food is prepared under ideal conditions. Coolie Camps.- The Coolies are housed in barasti huts. The huts are spaced about 30 ft: from each other to ensure proper ventilation of the coolie lines. These houses are better built and better kept than the local huts one sees in Manamah. Water suppl y. Adequate and safe. Lat^rines. The open trench system is used and appears satisfactory. Kitchens. Clean and sanitary. In conclusion, I am of opinion, that the employees of The Bahrain Petroleum Company live under conditions that will not be equalled by the average European for the next ten years. Kb expanse has been spared to make the conditions under which they live/I- live healthy and comfortable.

From this report it will be noted that living conditions in both the camps are about as good as can be expected when taking into consideration the fact that The Bahrein Petroleum Company have about 100 Europeans and 600 or 700 natives on their payroll who are working on a rush job of constructing a refinery, the It is^usual custom to have men live in tents, and occupy army cots instead of beds, when working on rush jobs. This we have avoided thus far and altho some men have had to live in tents at times, they have not had to do so for more than ten days or two weeks before a place was found for them in the regular bunkhouses and cottages. Tie are building additional living quarters just as quickly as it is humanly possible. Tnree additional bunkhouses, making four in all, of th.e 'new type* mentioned in Dr. Holmes♦ report, are rapidly nearing completion. Last Wednesday, these three houses were 77^, 48% and 10^ complete respectively but they should be 10U^ complete before tne real hot weather sets in. In fact, men are being moved into the first of the three today. Also, as a temporary measure, several of the additional cottages being built for married people will be used to house single men. These cottages were 89^, 55^ and 41&gt; as of Wednesday last. During the course of the next few months when Mr. Deacon 's men will start going home and additional living quarters will be available, we do not look for any complaints as to living conditions in either of our camps as we are giving our men the best possible treatment, both as to food and housing accommodations, that money can afford. Altho your inquiry relative to housing and sanitary conditions has been dealt with in Dr. Holmes' report and in this letter, nothing has been said relative to how the medical work is divided.All very urgent cases of both Europeans and Asiatic personnel are first treated by Dr. Lakra if that is possible. However, if that is not possible, they are taken to the Mission Hospital. All Class III personnel are usually sent to Dr. Holmes who works under a retainer but occasionally a case requiring a major operation is sent to the Mission Hospital for treatment. There is a reciprocal agreement between D p . Holmes and the Mission otaff whereby one treats the patients of the other during the absence of either party. Yours very truly G. W. R. SMITH, Chief Local Representative, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDNo.1100-28//V Political Agency, Bahrain, the 30th April 1936. To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sir, I beg to refer to your letter No.PA-368 dated the ISth January 1936 and to say that the intention of clause 1 is presumably to in^mnify, as regards the cost of repatriation, the 'Iraq Government against the Government of the country where the 'Iraqi is employed % in the event of his coming into conflict with the authorities. The need for such an indemnity would however appear to be discounted in the present case by the fact that the Bahrain Petroleum Company are prepared to repatriate 'Iraqis whom for any reason they have ceased to employ. If clause 2 Were extended to cover return to 1 Iraq on ceasing to be employed by the Company and not only, as at present, on being required to leave by the Political Agent, Bahrain, this might meet the •Iraq Government's requirements. 2. I should be glad if you would kindly let me know whether the Bahrain Petroleum Company would agree to such an extension of the clause. Yours faithfully, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain. ojuThe Bahrein Petroleum Company limited Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, May 1, 1936^ ger l \tiCALAG3 V Dear Colonel Loch: As the result of our recent conversation, and for your personal information, I am enclosing drafts of long and short term contracts being contemplated by our Company for Class II employees.

If this is done it will minimise the possibility of suits being brought in the Agency Courts for breach of contract and if they are brought the Court has definite material on which to make a decision.

I refer to such locally hired men as Jas. A. Dias, Indian Mechanic, Abdulaziz Lai Llohammed, Indian Turner, Harry John, Burmese Mechanic, etc., who were in Bahrein for years before the Company started operations here. It is not intended to offer these men a contract inasmuch as Bahrein is their home but we do intend to put all our other , Indian skilled and ser.i-s-: 1 ITeETI-Snployees on contract at an early date. As advised in my letter No, PA-481 of May 5, 1936, the new contract forms submitted with that letter have just recently been worked up, and the Company has not had time to put them in final shape for signing.

It should be w as you are aware there will be a large number of extra men here between this October and next June.* (a) Present Refinery capacity is 10,000 barrels thru- put per day. This will be increased to 20,000 and possibly sli^itly more. (b) Rather than just cover the number of Refinery men, I think it would be clearer to you if I gave you entire European and American staff of all depart ments of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited: Producing: Here at present 71. This Department will not increase and will probably decrease by some 6 or 7 men by the end of 1936. Later it will decrease considerably as most of the drillers will be sent Home on completion of the present drilling program. Refinery ) At present 38. This will increase to Operating) between 60 and 70 on completion of the Refinery in June 1937. Refinery ) Construction) At present 78. By December first this year there will be approximately 200, practically all of whom will be temporary men. The numbers will increase as follows: By October 1st 100 By November 1st 150 By December 1st 200■ ®f\ Paragraph 2&gt; (Cont'd) It is impossible to state at present what percentage will be British and what percentage (b) American as this will depend upon our ability to find satisfactory men in England. Your reference to Asiatics - assume means Class II-A and Class II-B personnel. We expect to have at the time of construction vrork some 250 British Indians of all kinds. After the construction work this number will be reduced by about 150. The better class Indians will live in Manama and be transported back and forth. The others will be housed temporarily in barestis pending building of pemanent quarters for them which cannot be started until,completion of the building program for the Europeans and Americans. (c) Old Camp (Jebel) - There are accommodations for sixty men, living two in a room, but we do not plan to use this Camp for anything except over-flow and I should say there will probably be a maximum of 20 men. New Camp (El Alwwi) - There are 40 rooms for bachelors in the present Staff Houses and we are building 52 additional rooms which makes a total of 72. Temporarily there will be tiro men in a room so that these houses will accom modate 144 men. In addition to these we are building 96 rooms in temporary buildings. There will be 8 buildings with 12 rooms in each. These rooms will be 12* x 17*. The buildings will be arranged in groups of four with a central bath house in each group. These quarters will later accommodate permanetit bachelors. Married Quarters - At present there are 25 conpletad and an additional seven have been approved. V More will be built depending upon the number of married men remaining on the permanent organization. There are five families living in Manama temporarily and one group of five bachelors also. (d) Has been answered above. The type of temporary houses will be wood frame filled in with feroosh and gutch, very similar to the permanent houses but less the verandas. The verandas will be replaced by shade 6' wide along the entire length of each building.-3- If there is any more information you would like to have, I vrould be glad to supplement.

No.219 of August 19, 1936, from Major E. H. Hawes, Protector of Emigrants, Bombay, to the Agent of Tlie Bahrein Petroleum Ccmpany Limited in Bombay. For your information M. Paul and D. M. Joshi were sent simple letter contracts from this office on July 18, 1936. These letters were written before Mr. Bush, our present Recruiting Agent, left for Bcmbay. We have also had written several other similar letters and we have advised Mr. Bush of such letters but it might not be possible for him to get in touch with the candidates before they get out of India. It seems to me, because of the Political Resident's recctnmendations to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, that the Protector of Emigrants should be a little more liberal with us while we are organizing our Recruiting Agency. We are prepared to give all Indians who arj^jifi here without having gone fEru the proper channels, contracts which the Protector of Emigrants will approve. With this assurance, thru your office, and the posting of a bond by our Recruiting Agent, it seems to us that the Protector of Emigrants should be entirely clear. You will realize that we are facing a very difficult emergency program and thus we will appreciate it if you can prevail upon the protector of Emigrants to facilitate the recruitment of men for the work as much as possible.

(Keceived under P.i-».Wo. 18 dated 10-9-36 from Political Agent, Bahrain, Karachi). P.H . Captain Hickin'bothaIn , s view that the Agency should dissociate itself, whether executively or judi cially or 'both, from 'the labour troubles of the Bah rain Petroleum Company** is hardly tenahle when it is considered that this Consulate General has to arbitrate in similar cases concerning the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany, and that the Protector of Emigrants is pressing for a similar arbitration arrangement to be incorpora ted in' the Bahrain Petroleum company agreements - to which we shall probably have to agree. 2^ obviously any case where redress is sought under a contract is strictly a 'legal case* and Mr. Howes * instructions as they stand are not to address the Company in such cases, and further to endeavour to discourage petitioners from suing in the Agency courts by advising them to institute proceedings in India. Experience over years with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company shows that Indians prefer to seek their redress on the spot and that for the employee to sue the Company in India is unsatisfactory for both parties. Presumably the Bahrain Petroleum Company would find it no less so. Surely the best thing is for the Political Agent to take up these cases with the Company in a non- Judicial manner as Mr. Howes has done, and try and/^^auses All and XIV^c) -2- arrive at a settlement 'by consent on the lines on which industrial compensation cases are dealt with, y Incidentally, the more one studies the terms of the agreements the more one realises that the -bomhay Government have grounds for regarding them as unfair, e.g. an employee can he dismissed at any time without notice for inefficiency or physical disability, in which case he has to pay his own passage hack to India and gets no pay during this period.

Your comments, ' asked for 1n paragranh 3 of my memorandum No.236l/l9/ 226, dated 21st November 1936, should be confined to any special points on which that agreement would act adversely against the employee.

(2) Witb regarcl to 14 ( Termination clause) • This clause deals witb various points which do not concern locally recruited labour 'but does cover one point of which this class should ^et the 'benefit i.e. vacation. It might read as follows? •Upon the termination of this agreement at the expiration of the term of service described in 1, or upon termination of this agreement 'by the Com pany on one (l) month notice Company shall allow employee a vacation in accordance with Company's vacation plan for class II-B employees in foreign service, as in effect at that time'*. (3) The clause with regard to arbitration (22) in the Bombay Grovernment Agreement (when it is incorpo rated in the agreement mentioned in (l) above) should be very useful to the Political Agent for deciding dis putes between the Company and locally recruited labour as well as for labour in India, see paragraph 3 above. 5. With regard to (c). This class should hold the same contract as class (b) does. 6. With regard to (d). flb comments. 7. Vith regard to (e). TTo comments. 8. 'With regard to (f). Compensation for injury is covered by clause 7 ( Injury) of the Bombay Government form of aPTPement. 9. Colonel Fowle has the following comments to make on your letter. (l) The Bombay Government agreement for skilled labour recruited in India provides for arbitration by the Political Agent, Bahrain (see paragraph 3 above) and (2)(g) ^ (2) 8 slmilsr clause will 'be In the agreement for locally recruited labour ( see paragraph 4 (3)a'bove)« Tf the plaintiff sues on the contract, the Court will merely refer the case for arhitrstion 'by the Political Agent, Bahrain, In the case of (l) the plaintiff can sue either in Bombay, where the contract was mafle, or in Bahrain, where the alleged breach occurred. In the case of (2) the suit can he filed only in Bahrain. 10. (l) In cases where arbitration has already taken place and an award has 'been made hy the Political Agent, if a dissatisfied party were to institute a suit in Court in resnect of the subject matter of the award, the defendants' tejoinder would he to apply under paragraph 20 of Schedule II to the Code of Civil Procedure ( V of 1908) for the filing of the award in Court, In which case the Court would have no alternative hut to pro nounce Judgement and issue a decree in accordance with the award, provided that none of the grounds mentioned in paragraphs 14 or 15 was proved. ^0 appeal would lie from such a decree so long as it was in accordance with the award. (2) In other words the Political Agent as arbitrator is virtually Cock of the Walk. If either of the parties sues on the contract before the matter has been referred to arbitration, the Court, on the application of the other party, stays the suit and refers the matter to the arbitration of the Political Agent ( paragraph 18). If either of the parties sues after an award has been made, the Court Issues a decree In accordance with the award, provided none of the grounds In paragraphs 14 and 15 are proved. It is to be noted, therefore that it is up to the Political Agent as arbitrator to see that, so far as possible, his award provides no grounds under paragraphs© ^ psragra-pbs 14 anfl 15 wherecm be migbt be asked subse- qt7eptly to set aside as a Court tbe award be bad pre viously made as Politics! Agent. 11 # ^itb regard to tbe rest of your letter iti wbicb you suggest tbat tbe situation should be kept ,, fluid ,, and tb?t you should deal with cases 'politically ratber tban legally 11 , Colonel ^owle is of opinion tbat tbe matter should now be put on a proper legal contractual basis. Political action^ to settle cases will probably take more time and trouble than settling such cases straight forwardly by arbitration. Moreover, since you as Political Agent, may be involved as arbitrator in set+ling such cases it would be undesirable for you to intervene in any other capacity. 12. To sum ut &gt; . Colonel Towle will be glad of your comments as soon as possible on (a) the Bombay Covemment forms of agreement re ferred to in paragraph 3 above, and (b) the local form of agreement referred to in paragranh 4 above.

When Colonel ^owle has your comments he will put up the pro posed form of contract to the Government of India for their approval, and when this has been obtained the Company will be approached and asked to provide with such contracts all existing employees of this class and any who may be engaged in the future. 13.

I asked the Chief Local Repre sentative to let me have a copy of the letter and any reply which the Company proposed to send to the Protector of Emigrants. I told him that I would inform the Resident of the situation and suggest that the Government of India be wired to to the effect that it is desirable that no visas for Bahrain should be given to British Indian sub jects unless they are in possession of a No Objection Certificate issued by the Political Agent, Bahrain, the reason for this being that although the Co»pany are them selves making an honest effort to prevent people arriving here in search of work, their very presence in the Island is an inducement for those out of work to come to Bahrain. I further told them that I would tighten up the enquiries which are instituted when a person applies for a No Ob jection Certificate. 30th June 1937.The Bahrein petroleum Company limited No.PA-309.

(c) Indian labour (1) recruited in India (2) recruited in Bahrain. (d) Foreign labour e.g. (i) Iraqis ( (ii| Persians and iii) Saudi Arabians, recruited (1) outside Bahrain (2) in Bahrain. (e) Bahrain subjects. Under B the following classes of labour may be employed: (a) Indians. (b) Foreigners e.g. (i) Iraqis. (ii) Persians and (iii) Saudi Arabians. (c) Bahrain subjects. 3, The engagement of the above labour is based on the follow ing/ Captain T. Hickinbotham., I # A.&gt; Poli tical Agent, BAHRAIN.J• P- r V 1- following forms of contracts; The classes under A (a), and A (b), have presumably proper contracts, but this point needs clearing novv, (see your letter ^No. 1376-28/14, dated the 23rd May, 1937). The class under A (c)(1) is engaged on the form of contract approved by the Government of Bombay - vide their letter No. 1341/34-A, dated the 9th November, 1936, copy sent to you. There is no contract at present for the class of employees under a(c )(2), but it is proposed to put the contract form to the Government of India for their approval, please see Rya^s D.O. No. 94, dated the 13th January, 1937, paragraph 12 (b). With regard to class A(d)(i)(l), a few Iraqis were sent from Iraq on a guarantee given by^Mesopotamia persia corporation Limited on behalf of the Bahrain Petroleum company - vide your letter No. 540-28/14, dated the ^3rd February, 1936, and Bushire memorandum No. 5^8 of the 14th March, 1936. The question of guarantee raised therein does not seem to have been finally decided It seems that no form of contracts exists for the classes under (d )(i)(2), (d){ii)(2) and (d)(iii)(2), and probably no one is engaged abroad under the classes (d)(ii)(l) and (d)(iii)(l). But it is desired that labour under class (d) should be in pos sg- s sion of contracts similar to those for A(c)(2l abov e, (vide Bushire memorandum No. 2752 of 31st December, 1935, para 11,C). Regarding the class under A(e). it is for the Bahrain Government to safe guard the interests of their subjects. The emigration of employees under B(a) is unlawful under section 10(1) of the Indian Emigration Act, 1922, presumably, therefore, no one is so employed. It is not considered necessary to have contracts for the class of labour under B(b){i)(ii) and (iii). Regarding the class under B(c), it is for the Bahrain Government to safe guard the interests of their subjects. 4. Before putting the matter up to the Government of India Mr. Caroe/-3- Mr. Caroe desires me to ask you for any further comments you may have especially with regard to A(a) and (b); A(c)(2) and A(d)(i), (ii) and (iii), and B(a). est*- r 'JD.O* No. 7^06 , The 5th October 1937. ry dear Smith, I should be gr^teftil if you could let me know whether the skilled Indian lebour recruited In Bahrain by the Bahrain Petroleur!

AW' Reference your letter DO $2062 of 5th October, The skilled Indian labour locally recruited by this Company do not have a form of contract, these contracts at present only applying to those men engaged through our Recruiting Agent in Bombay, though it is the intention that locally engaged Class 11B Indians should eventually be put on the same form of contract as those hired in India. Class 11B in this case are locally hired skilled Indians drawing more than Rs. 3/8/- per day. Of these we now have 89 while we have as well 147 Class 111 skilled Indians or skilled Indians drawing less than Rs. 3/8/- per day. These men were partly engaged on our ordinary form ^HP4 and partly by letter copies of which are attached. Prior to the opening of our Recruiting Office in Bombay in 1936 we hired some men directly from India by letter a copy of which is also attached but of these there are now only three remaining in our service. These three will also even tually be put on our standard form of contract when its final form is approved by The Protector of Qnigrants in Bombay. 2. We have at present 15 skilled Iraqis recruited from outside Bahrein one of whom is on contract, the remainder having been hired by form letter. A copy of the contract and a copy of the form letter are enclosed. No other Iraqis, Persians, or Saudi Arabians have been recruited from outside Bahrein. 3.

Dear Sir, Referring to our letter No.326 of July 23rd with regard to contracts for locally hired Class IIB and IIA employees, will you please note that we have received a communication from our Bombay Agents suggesting that the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, communicates with the Secretary to the Bombay Government on the subject as the latter apparently decided some time last year that the Indian type of contract should apply to Indians hired by us locally. up are:- (a) The points we would very raueh like to have cleared nil Whether the Government of Bombay and/or the Protector of Emigrants, Bombay, have any jurisdiction over the type of contract that is used to hire Indians in other countries• (b) Whether the Government of Bombay has any authority to order Companies working in other countries to adopt a certain form of contract for hiring Indians locally who when in India do not reside within the Jurisdiction of the Bombay Government. In this connection we should mention that of the 103 Class IIA and IIB employees who are not on contract, 33 reach their homes through Bombay and 70 through Karachi* Yours very truly. t: Chief Loc THE BAHREIN jpresentative. &gt;ETR0LEUM COMPANY LIMITED.

To The Honourable the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf, Camp Karachi, Sir, In continuation of my letter No. 1219 of the 10th Aug ust 1938, I have the honour to forv /ard a copy of a letter No. PA-378 which I have received from the Chief Local Representa tive, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. 2. I think that the first paragraph is merely thoughtlessly worded, and that I ne d not take up the Company on the point of their Bombay Agents suggesting courses of action to the Honour able the Political Resident, 3. As regards paragraph 2 (a) of the letter, we certainly should not give a ruling that the Company could brandish in the face of the Protector of Emigrants or the Bombay Government, though my opinion is that the Company's point of view is Justi fied, and that neither of these authorities should Interfere in the sphere of jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Their function is to see. that people do not leave India without proper prospects of employment, and they must then leave the protection of their emigrants to the local political authorities, 4. As regards paragraph 2(b) of the letter, I again agree /• with the Company 's point of view. The Bombay Government is now/-«pp —* * ■-2- |oi now an ordinary Provincial Government| and any political functioiB that it once possessed have come under the External Affairs Department. 5. i There is no doubt that this matter is perturbing the Company considerably, and will make them more ready to agree to satisfactory contracts for locally recruited labour, as to be approved by you. £) 6. I would suggest that I do not reply until I receive your views on my letter under'reference. I would then reply that you have arranged with the Bombay Government that the question of contracts for locally recruited Indians shall be dealt with by you, and that the following are your re quirements# i I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ju • Captain, Offgi Political Agent, Bahrad C 5](£■ I: ^ Confidential No. C/632-28/14 Political Agency f Bahrain, the 9th October 1938.

It will 'be ot erved from the marginally noted correspondence that the attitude adopted 'by the Agent is not at all fair and one cannot arrive at any con clusion other than that the Company is procrasti nating in order to avoid compliance vitn tne G-overn- ment order. 5. This question of putting the 319 men on agreements and registering them in this ofrice is very important in the interest of the Indians. Besides the question of putting the locally engaged Indians was represented 'by the Imperial Indian Citizenship Association, Bombay»and that tney are awaiting to see that the locally engaged aen are 'brought under the control of the Indian Emigration Act. As I had decided to report this matter to Grovernmeat for their further orders I will now a ait your reply in the matter. I vould, therefore, request you kindly to inform me, at your earliest, hat-o- /f9 L © what action you propose to taico in thin matlc-r. Upto nov: out or the 519 Indians reierred to alsove the Oompany have registered oniy 25 agreements. 6. I may further . tate i'or your information that the Bahrein Petroleum Go., Ltd., had no recruiting office or Agent in Bombay. Their methods of indirect recruitment were to invite emigrant-employees from ^ 1 India who defrayed their own expenses to Bahrein and then employ them there. .iThen this indirect recruitment , . was detected in Juiy 1936, the Gomjany ;,as ouxiged to u * 'V , j^pen a peruianent recruiting office in Bombay. Since n &lt; 4 u ' x tnen the locd office of the Gom^any recruited about k N ^ 462 Indians out or vhich about 202 have axready been 1. M/; repatriated to India for the following reasons : (l) 135 persons returne to India after rv termination of their agreements by the Goaipany under ^clause lu for various reasons but in majority of ca;&gt;es for 'inefficiency 1 *; (2; 12 persons returnee after completion of their contracts; (3) 27 persons returned after teriniaating their contracts on account of the alleged unsatisfactory treatment; (4) 4 persons returned but the reasons for their return are not uno..n. (5j 4 persons returned on account of sickness. 7. Practically every repatriate.i e.ai^rant ..hen he reports to me makes various ^in.is of complaiuts. kany of them tate tnat no useful purpo. e v/ill be served by filing a written complaint inlividually but they urge that Government should appoint an En-uiry Gommittee to investigate tae various complaints which tney ma^e and nece.isary action snould be tci^en in general. Tne number of complaints does not show any sign of decrease but on the contrary they aave increased and the local ne s papers hai jiven wide pubiici ty K csputlicity to them. The very fact of the increase ia the nanTber of complaints shows that no soita'ble action has 'been taken 'by the Company to minimise the emigrants* grievances. 8. Out of these repatriated emigrants 153 persons filed their written complaints 'before me. They were all referred to the Company. In 135 cases complaints were found either wholly or partially trae. The claims vere and are admitted 'by the Company an.! the dues were and are 'being paid 'by the Company. The remain ing complaints are either still under investigation or proved to he unsuccessful. y. The atove figures themselves warrant taking various measures in the matter. It is nee:1 less to say that at this port there are large number of recruiting agents such as Agent for the Anglo-Iranian Cil Co., Ltd., The Kuwait Oil Co., Ltd., Petroleum Concessions Ltd., etc., who recruit reguiariy every year hundreds of Indians for service at various peaces abroad and in their cases I do not find any irregu larity nor do they change their arguments in order to meet their cases and show unreasonable grounds justifying their action. 10. At the 'beginning of this year, in order to minimise the complaints and grievances of the Indians I had ta^cen necessary steps 'but it appears to me that the Company nave not taKen my suggestions in tiie same spirit in vhich I had given viz. to minimise the complaints and grievances of the emigrants and that they have shifted their recruit ment from Bombay to another port. JTrom a petition' 'before me it appears that the Punja'b/i 'batch which ' as ta^en to Bahrein from another port is also not satisfied with the treatment meted out to them. 11.

P.A.-481 dated the 5-6-1936 and P.A.-592 dated 29-7-1936 informed us that Mr. M. Bush would recruit labour and in their letter No. P.A.-628 dated 24-8-1936, para. 2, and Letter No. PA-674 dated 21-9-1936 they ts&amp;sltl definitely cite Mr. Bush as 'Our Recruiting Agent'. It is therefore nowhere implied that the B.P.C. and the S .A.S.C.C. were subsidiary companies, and the C.L.R. is aware that as regards passport questions, the two companies have been treated as separate concerns. It is pretty certain that the Protector of Emigrants was not aware that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain were separate foreign states, though he has treated Mr. Bush as the Recruiting Agent of the B.P.C. Prior approval should however have been sought to include Saudi Arabia in the contracts since the B .P.C. are aware that Saudi Arabia is a separate Kingdom not connected with Bahrain, especially in view of the fact that a copy of P.R's telegram No. 561 dated 2-8-1936 was sent to the C.L.R. on the 2-8-1936. The Government of Bombay have, however, been informed by P.R. that Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with Bahrain. I am informed on good authority that all contracts in Bahrain and on the Mainland haire been changed How this has been done I am trying to ascertain -^whether fresh contracts countersigned by the Protector of Emigrants have been entered into or not.
