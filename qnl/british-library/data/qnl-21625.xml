Although primarily the outcome of a conflict between Arab and Jewish Nationalism, the revolt was definitely anti-Government and anti-British in character; it was in fact - to quote the statement of H.M. Government on the 7th September 1936 - ' a direct challenge to the authority of the British Government in Palestine '. The Jews ranged themselves on the side of the Mandatory, the Arabs for the most part against it, while the neighbouring mandated territory of Trans-Jordan under the friendly hand of the Amir Abdullah remained undisturbed and remarkably disinterested. During the six months that it lasted the Rebellion went through the successive stages of violent rioting; a general strike and campaign of civil disobedience; a campaign of terrorism and intimidation, in which the sniper the bomb thrower and the gangster played a prominent part; widespread sabotage with attacks on all forms of communications; and finally the formation of bands of armed men and the conduct of a regular regime of guerilla warfare under a self-styled 'Commander-in-Chief'. In its course it took toll of the lives of 28 British combatants, 80 Jewish civilians and over 1000 Arabs: the British and Jewish wounded totalled more than 500; and the direct cost to the taxpayers of Palestine - apart from millions in loss of trade - was estimated at £3g- million. Of the latter the saboteur accounted for some £300,000, while in a naturally treeless country which derives its main wealth from its fruit products 200,000 trees and 3,500 acres of crops were wantonly destroyed. In the task of restoring order two infantry battalions, two squadrons of aircraft, a company of armoured cars and the Trans-Go rdan Frontier Force were available at the outset for duties which in six months had absorbed the greater part of two Divisions, as well as four squadrons of aircraft and detachments from various ships of the Mediterranean Fleet. Such then was the character of the Palestine Rebellion of 1936. Though it had its novel features it was in the main like many others which it has fallen to the lot of British forces to^ quell in the past, and much of its history may repeat itself in any which recur in the^ future. A study therefore of the successes and the failures of British arms in Palestine during this period may contribute towards the shorten ing of similar operations and the saving of life and effort on another occasion. That is the object of this book. A firm warning is however necessary regarding the method of applying these lessons elsewhere. In reading the following pages it is most necessary that two important factors, which influenced every thought and deed at the time, should be kept constantly in mind. The first is the special condition under which the fighting forces were employed.^ Throughout the whole period - even when engaged in open warfare he hills - troops and aircraft were still only acting in aid of the civil power with all the consequent restrictions; these restrictions naturally varied widely according to circumstances, but at no time were the armed forces free to make the fullest use of the weapons at their disposal. The second factor is the nature of the opponent. The Palestinian Arab is not a fighting man: even when led and reinforced by trained and experienced individuals from Iraq, Syria and Transjordan, the rank and file still retained their characteristics of carelessness, lack of enter prise, and a wholesome regard for their own skins. They had none of the military qualities of, for instance, the tribesmen of the North-West frontier of India. As a rule they were indifferently armed and44816-1 2 invariably poor marksmen. Traditional Arab warfare is an affair of much noise and the minimum of casualties, and many an Arab rebel was content to ”do his bit' by firing off his ammunition at night at long range with the least possible risk to himself but as often as not without any definable target. Sven the more offensive and energetic showed them selves remarkably conservative in habit: a site where an effective hold-up or successful sabotage had been achieved assumed a lasting popularity, and was used time and again, often in exactly the same way and even at the same hour. There were of course many notable exceptions but on the whole it would be difficult to find a more obliging adversary, and risks could be and frequently were taken which would have been quite unjustifiable in any other country. This factor, together with the constant restrictions on the employment of force, coloured the whole course of the operations and both must be taken into full account in drawing any deductions from them. The subject matter contained in the following pages has been selected from the mass of data recorded immediately after the operations by those who had taken part in them and collated by every Formation in Palestine in November 1936. The interval which has since elapsed has made it possible for the events of the year to be seen in better perspec tive and the lessons to be drawn from them more clearly defined. It is not intended in this book to describe the course of the Rebellion or the scene of its happenings any more than is necessary to form a background to the military lessons. Geographical references have been avoided as far as possible, and any lessons peculiar to Palestine alone and unlikely to be generally applicable elsewhere have been omitted. For those who require a more complete picture, accounts of the rebellion and of the country are to be found in two publications of H.M. Stationery Office - 'Report by His Majesty *3 Government in the United Kingdom of Gr eat Britain and Northern Ireland to the Council of the League of Na tions on t he Administration of Palestine and Trans-J o rdan for the year 19 56' (Colo nial No . 129) and ’ Palestine Royal Commission Rep ort' (Cmd._ 5479). A detailed description of Palestine is contained in ' The Handbook of Ik-A lP.'fci - 16 Q^ad Trans-Jord an', issued under the authority of the Government or? Palestine and published by Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd, St. Martin’s St., F u ’.don. The arrangement of chapters has been designed to give a picture of the setting and the actors before continuing with the action, and the operations themselves are described mostly in Chapters 11 to 15. As much derailed matter as possible has been removed from the text to the Appendices. All important place names occurring in the text are to be found in Map No. 2 illustrating aircraft zones.44816-1 3 CHAPTER 2 A SH ORT HISTORY OR THE REBELLION r-~UP TO THE END OP JUNE 1936 The object of this book is not to produce an historical record of happenings in Palestine in 1936; but some brief outline of the setting and of the sequence of events which took place there is necessary as a background against which to view in their proper perspective the lessons which follow. This chapter starts therefore with some reference to the geography of Palestine, its climate, people and armed forces, and continues with a note on the issues which led to the rebellion and a brief narrative of its course. The detailed history, up to the 14th September 1936, may be read in the ”Abridged Despatch by Air Vic e Marshal R.E.C. Peirse, C.B., D.S.O., A.F. C.” published by the Air Ministry as a Secret document. As that publication must necessarily have a limited distribution, it was thought that a condensed narrative in more or less day-to-day form might conveniently be inserted in the following pages. It has been based to a large extent upon Air Vice Marshal Peirse’s Despatch. General Description The boundaries of Palestine form a rough triangle v/ith its base^ resting in the Sinai Desert and its apex close to the Lebanon Mountains, while Trans-Jordan and the Mediterranean flank it to the East and West respectively. In area it is about 10,000 square miles, and comparable therefore with Wales or Belgium. Its northern boundary with Syria for the most part lies in a range of mountains, not easily accessible, of some three to four thousand feet in neight; on the .bast the River Jordan separates it from the Arab state of Trans-Jordan; while the frontier with Egypt stretches far down into the stony wastes of Eastern Sinai. The Main Geographical Feature s Palestine may be divided into four principle regions :- The Coastal Plain widens almost uniformly as one goes South from a width of a mile or less near Haifa to some twenty miles about Gasa. Prom Haifa it stretches an arm inland as far as the Jordan by Beisan; and this arm forms the famous Plain of Esdraelon - the ancient Armageddon - which intersects the whole of the mountain system. In the Coastal Plain and the Plain of Esdraelon are to be found most of the Jewish Settlements and the main railway system, but in^1936 it was singularly lacking in good road communications. Both plains are on the whole extremely fertile, although covered in parts near the coast with a shallow layer of sand. Th^ Mountains run North and South through the centre of Palestine THE SCENE OP THE REBELLION a b c d The Coastal Plain. The Mountains. The Desert. The Jordan Valley.44816-1 4 There they merge into the hills of Judea, which continue south wards in the form of a long zig-zag central spine - on which Jerusalem is sited - until they descend to meet the desert below Hebron. It was the mountain district which was the home of the armed bands in 1936, and in consequence was the scene of the principal fighting. Strangely enough the mountain district also carried the main road communications particularly the road from Jerusalem to Nazareth via Nablus which was the chief artery between North and South. The Desert area lies for the most part south of the G-aza-Beersheba road. It consists largely of gently rolling country with a hard stony surface, though sand is encountered in many places especially near the coast. The nature of the country made it an area particularly suited to the aircraft and armoured cars of the Royal Air Force, and later for the employment of the 8 th King’s Royal Irish Hussars in their Ford ’’pick-ups'. The Jordan Valley proper links the Sea of G-alilee with the Dead Sea, but a similar formation extends Northwards to Syria through the marshes of Lake Hula and Southwards to the G-ulf of Akaba through the Wadi Araba. The Jordan Valley is a deep trough lying well below sea level between the hills of Samaria and Judea on the Palestine side and the hills of Moab in Trans-Jordan. Being intensely hot and malarious, it was seldom occupied by British Troops and remained throughout the rebellion the hunting ground of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force. The Climate The whole period of the rebellion passed in the summer season. The months of April to October were dry and rather abnormally hot: the days were characterized by an almost cloudless sky, giving good visibility, and the nights by heavy dev/s with an unexpected chilliness in fcne hill districts. The mean temperature of the central highlands was slightly over 72 degrees and that of the plains some 4 degrees higher; . while the Jordan Talley, which has a tropical climate very similar co that ot trie Sudan, averaged 82 degrees and rose at times to 110 and higher. There was no rain until the 28th October, and the first heavy fall of the season was on the 21st November. The P opulation ine population on the 30th June 1936, exclusive of His Majesty’s Forces, was estimated as follows:- Christian Airabs 87,000 Noslem Amahs 84-3,000 Arabs of other religions 12,000 Total Arabs 942,000 jews 370,000 Others 24,000 Total Population 1,336,00044816-1 5 Arab one. The small Jewish communities of Jaffa and Hebron moved to safer quarters early in the rebellion. The principal Arab towns were Jaffa (60,000), Nablus, Hebron and Gaza. Outside the towns - speaking in very general terms - the settled Arabs were to be found mostly in the hill districts and the Bedouin in the Desert and the Jordan Valley; while the Jewish agricultural settle ments spread across the Coastal Plain and the Plain of Esdraelon, up the Valley to Metulla, the northernmost point in Palestine. The population of Trans-Jordan was practically sill Arab - primarily Bedouin - except for some 6,000 Moslem Circassians, who had been settled there as frontier guards by Sultan Abdul Hamid II after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8. The Armed Fo rces The Armed Forces in April 1936 consisted of units of the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force under the command of the Air Officer Commanding, who was responsible as military adviser to the High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. There was also the Palestine Police Force and the Arab Legion, v/hich was the police force of Trans-Jordan. The former was under command of an Inspector-General (R. G. B. Spicer, Esq. CMG. MC.) who was directly responsible to the High Commissioner, while El Ferik F. G. Peake Pasha CHE. commanded the Arab Legion under the authority of the Trans-Jordan Government.

It was the first to be directed deliberately against the Government and against British authority. The riots of 1920, 1921, 1929 and 1933 had been solely of an inter racial character, being directed by the Arabs against the Jews as the latter developed with unprecedented rapidity from an unobtrusive minority into a community of great political, industrial and agricult ural importance. The years 1934 and 1935 saw an enormous increase in Jewish immigration - over 100,000 being admitted legally during that period - which, together with extensive land purchases by Jews, pro foundly disturbed the Arab population. At the same time they noted with deep interest the gaining of independence by Iraq and the example of a prolonged and successful strike in Syria against the French authorities. On top of this came the Mediterranean crisis in the autumn of 1935, which followed upon the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, Its immediate consequences in Palestine were the failure of the tourist season, with the very serious local losses which that involves, and a marked lowering of British prestige. By October the Arab leaders were beginning to feel that the opportunity to realise their political and national aims was drawing close, and two further incidents occurred before the end of the year which did much to confirm that belief. In October an abortive attempt was made to smuggle a large quantity of arms and ammunition through the Port of Jaffa, and every Arab firmly believed that these were intended for Jews for purposes of aggression. Then, in the xollowing month, one Sheikh Izz Ud Din A1 Qassam, acting on fanatical impulse, took to the hills in the Jenin area with an armed following. His career was cut short by the total destruction of his band by the police,^but his action was acclaimed by the Arabs as an act of patriotic sacrifice. The beginning of 1936 thus found the stage set for a further out break of serious trouble; it is unlikely that any definite programme had yet been prepared, but the crowd was ready and an unrehearsed cue might send up the curtain. It came suddenly in the third week of April. On the night of the fifteenth Arab highwaymen held up a number of cars on the road between Tulkarm and Nablus and deliberately singled out three Jews whom they shot down in cold blood. The following night two armed men, who were generally believed to be Jews, entered a hut near Petah Tiqva and shot dead the two Arab occupants. On the 17th and 18th inter-racial feeling ran very high, particularly where Arabs and Jews met on the Jaffa-Tel Aviv border, and various acts of violence occurred including a number of Jewish assaults on Arabs. On the morning of Sunday, the 19th April, the wildest rumours of Jewish murders of Arabs — all quite unfounded — oegan to circulate in Jaffa, and crov/ds of Arabs started to congregate in the centre of the town. All the efforts of the District Commissioner failed to convince either the crowd or their leaders oi the falsity of these reports and, while the parley was actually in progress, further and even wilder rumours reached tne mob. At this all semblance o± control broke, and throughout Jaffa and on the first few miles of the road to Jerusalem Arab crowds made violent and indiscriminate attacks on every Jew or European, regardless of age or sex. By midday the rebellion had started: murderous mobs of Arabs had stopped all road communication between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and the entrances to Jaffa were strewn with overturned cars and burning buses amid a welter ol blood, stones and broken glass.44816-1 8 S EQUS~;IC5 OF EVENTS OF THE PJ^ELLIQ N 19th April The first intimation of disorder reached tne Officer Commanding British Troops at 11.20 a.m., when the Company Commander of the Cameron Highlanders at Sarafand reported a request for military assistance oy the District Commissioner at Jaffa. Three platoons left at 12,15 and reached Jaffa at 12.56, when they were at once disposed at centres in the town in close support of the police. By this time a number of murders had occurred and the police had been compelled to fire three rounds. The arrival of the troops had an immediately steadying effect and they were able to avoid coming into actual conflict wit: tne mob. On the way in to Jaffa the Camerons had however to detach half a platoon to assist in the rescue of Jewish workgirls from the Maspero Cigarette Factory, which Arabs were attempting to burn down. By 2 p.m. the situation in Jaffa was once more in hand, but feeling ran very high and it was not until a curfew was imposed at 7 p.m, that a calm was reached. That night the Jews counted seven dead and the Arabs two, while scores of injured were lying in the hospitals. Both Arabs had been killed by police bullets. Meanwhile the rest^of the country v/as buzzing with rumour: considerable excitement prevailed in Haifa and Nablus, and there was acute tension in Jerusalem where Jewish shop keepers in the Old City were hastily putting up shutters. It became evident that nightfall' had brought only a lull and that the morrow would be charged with danger. Accordingly the Air Officer Commanding at 6 p.m. ordered the first stage of the Internal Security Scheme to be put into operation, and by 2.50 a.m. on the morning of the 20th all troops were in their action stations. 20th April Early next morning the rioting in the neighbourhood of Jaffa was renewed, and a second company of the Cameron Highlanders moved from Jerusalem to Sarafand, whence two more platoons were despatched to re inforce Jaffa. The situation improved during the afternoon, and the troops were withdrawn from the streets at 6 p.m. without having been called upon by the civil authorities to intervene. The casualities of the day had been 7 killed and 58 injured. In the rest of the country many of tne shops had closed and signs of agitation were evident in all Arab quarters. 21st April .me day saw the close of the Jaffa rioting and the beginnings of an Arab General Strike. By now the toll at Jaffa had risen to 21 dead and 147 injured. Demonstrations had been held in various parts of the country but no serious disturoance had occurred. 22nd April Arab attention now seemed to turn for the moment from open violence to tne intensification ob the strike. Local 'committees' appeared everywhere and forced shopkeepers to put up their shutters, while most of the schools struck and work ceased in the Port of Jaffa. Arab buses and taxis were idle, and a campaign of nail-strewing in the main soreets was initiated in an attempt to stop other traffic. 25rd - 25th April lenoion had subsided considerably, but the strike spread rapidly and had become general throughout the country with the exception of Haif a *44816-1 9 Acts of violence v/hich occurred were confined to unruly demonstrations, stoning of motor-cars, and the burning of Jewish timberyards, crops and etc., all of which were reported from various districts. Meanwhile the Arab leaders had not been idle. Realising at last that the spontaneous outbreak had given them their cue, they started at once to convert it to an organised rebellion. On the 25th all parties sunk their differences for the first time in Palestine's history, and together formed 'the Arab Higher Committee' to control national activities. At the head was Kaj Amin Sffendi al Husseini, Mufti of Jerusalem and President of the Supreme Moslem Council, who led the extreme elements; and it was significant to find his rival of nearly twenty years - Ragheb Bey Nashashibi, President of the moderate 'Defence Party' - ranged beside him. The Committee formulated their terms and issued them in the form of a letter to the High Commissioner. In it they affirmed their intention to continue the strike until the British Government should make a fundamental change in their policy: in parti cular they demanded the prohibition of Jewish immigration and land purchase, and the establishment of a National Government. 26th - 27th April From this point the situation assumed a different complexion, and a tendency to unrest spread beyond the towns to the rural areas as the leaders, in order to sustain their claims, sought to bring increased pressure on the authorities. 26th April Rioting in Nazareth soon gave evidence that the wave of agitation had reached the North. The police were compelled to fire on the crowd, and a detachment of the Loyal Regiment also came into contact. 29th April A riot took place in the evening around the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem, where for the first time shots were fired at the police. The day marked the beginning of the indiscriminate shooting and bomb- throwing which was to continue throughout the summer. 50th April - 4th May The last day of April passed quietly, but on the 1st May police had to use force to disperse crowds in Haifa and Jaffa. Meanwhile arson, sniping, bombing and attacks on motor cars continued to increase and to spread to all districts. 5th - 7th May The attitude of the Arab leaders was rapidly becoming more and more rebellious, and on the 5th the High Commissioner found it necessary to issue a warning to the Higher Committee. Simultaneously two notorious agitators were arrested. The Committee's reply made it clear rhat cne warning was being disregarded, and on the 7th it announced that non payment of taxes and civil disobedience would start on the 15th May if the Government had not by that date acceded to the Arab demands. On the same day the first cases of sabotage on the railway were reported. It was clear that the situation was deteriorating, and that it was only a matter of time before unrest and violence became widespread. Accordingly the High Commissioner called a meeting that evening with the Air Officer Commanding at which it was decided that reinforcement of the garrison had become necessary, and requests v/ere telegraphed to Egypt for troops and to Iraq for armoured cars of the R.A.F.8th - 11th May 44816-1 10 The next four days passed in comparative quiet, though bombing was plainly on the increase and attempts at sabotage on the railway were becoming more frequent and more serious, culminating in an attack on one of the most important bridges south of Gaaa which, if successful, would have cut communication with Egypt. Some disturbances also occurred in Jerusalem. It was necessary to take elaborate precautions to ensure the safe passage of the troop trains from Egypt, and on the 10th detachments of Camerons from Jerusalem were moved down to the railway. All went well however, and during the night the 1st Bn. Royal Scots Fusiliers with two sections of light tanks reached Sarafand, while the remainder of 'C' Coy, 6 thBn. Royal Tank Corps, went on to Haifa. The following day two sections of No.l Armoured Car Coy. R.A.F. arrived by road from Iraq, and were attached to No. 2 Company at Rami eh. 12th - 16th May . By this time it had become evident that the rebellion, while continuing to hold its own, was making little headway and there was growing apathy with regard to the national strike movement. Accordingly members of the Higher Committee and other delegations paid a round of visits with a view to strengthening the strike and raising the national spirit in the country districts. It was unfortunate that official steps were not taken to stop this, for its immediate results were soon apparent and there is no doubt that it marked a turning point in the rebellion. Unrest occurred again in Jaffa, and in Jerusalem two Jews were murdered: acts of violence and sabotage started to increase, and in the North a new era of lawlessness began. The situation demanded fresh military measures. The Royal Scots Fusiliers with some armoured cars were despatched to Gaza and, in view of the troublesome condition of the Jordan Valley, a half company of mechanised infantry of the Frontier Force was moved from Trans«-Jordan to Jericho. Meanwhile air reconnaissances were increased, and armoured cars and tanks patrolled various districts. On the 14th a convoy system under military protection was instituted for both civil and military traffic on the main roads. 17th - 20th May Late at night on the 16th May a particularly brutal outrage occurred in Jerusalem which profoundly disturbed the Jewish population and which resulted in a nightly curfew which was not to be lifted for some six months. At 9.15 p.m. one or two unidentified individuals entered a crowded cinema in the Jewish residential quarter and fired five shots into the audience. Three Jews were killed and two nore injured, while tne assailants escaped unscathed. The following day there was much shooting in Jerusalem and Haifa, and another murder was committed in oroad daylight in Jerusalem where an Austrian was shot dead in a busy street, the murderer again escaping. On the 18th it was announced that a Royal Commission would proceed to Palestine as soon as order had been restored; but the announcement had no appreciable ^ effect on the local situation. It was clear that the centre of gravity was beginning to shift from the towns to the country districts, and a number of military columns carried out a series of marches to 'show the flag'. Meanwhile the list of outrages steadily grew longer and the toll of murder claimed almost daily victims. The spread of revolt across the rural areas altered the military problem, and further reinforcements were asked for. These were particularly44816-1 11 required to meet the ever increasing cadis from the police for military assistance: already signs of disaffection among the Arab police had appeared and it had become necessary to post military guards on many vulnerable points, such as railway workshops, oil depots, power houses, post offices, telephone exchanges and the Broadcasting Station. 21st May On the 21st an even more intense wave of crime swept across the entire country: scores of bombs were thrown, vehicles were shot at, police were attacked in many places, and the railway and telephone communications were seriously damaged. The day also saw the first important engagement with an armed band and the first military casualty. The band had taken up a position on the Jerusalem-Jaffa road a few miles outside Jerusalem, and just before dark opened fire on passing vehicles wounding a man and a woman. Two truckloads of Camerons were soon on the spot and attacked in the failing light, but the band hastily retreaded and managed to escape in the dark among the rocky hillsides. In following them up one soldier was wounded. The same evening reinforcements of railway troops arrived at Sarafand from Egypt. They had been asked for in view of the increasing railway sabotage and intimidation of railwaymen, and consisted of the 42nd Eield Coy. R.E. (which included a railway operating section) and a detachment of Royal Horse Artillery manning some armed motor trollies. 22nd - 25th May On the morning of the 22nd the 1st Bn. Seaforth Highlanders, from Cairo, detrained at Tulkarm for Nablus. But even before uheir arrival the centre of interest had already shifted to Nablus. The state of affairs in that historic centre of trouble had rapidly been groif/ing worse, and the town was now quite out of hand. Barricades had been laid^ across the main road and in the narrow alley-ways of the native town, v/hixs heavy sniping of the Fort and the camp was being directed from the ^teep slopes of Mounts Cerizim and Ebal, which directly overlook them. Nevertheless the arrival of the Scaforth passed without incident, and it was not until next day that more armed bands began to make their presence felt. It had not been possible to clear all the baggage of the^ battalion from Tulkarm Station the previous day, and now it was found that the road had been heavily blocked by huge boulders rolled down^from the^ hillside while a motley crowd armed with sticks, knives and a few rifles held the barriers. Seaforth Highlanders with some armoured cars soon dispersed them, capturing three and wounding two of the armed men; but it clearly showed that in the Nablus district at any rate the fellaheen were now completely out of control. That night Air Vice Marshal Peirse reported to the High Commissioner that the Assistant District Commissioner had advocated the imposition of Martial Law in the Nablus Area. The next two days saw violent outbreaks in the neighbourhood of Nazareth and Gaza, while the daily list of murders, incendiarism, and attacks on troops, police, and motor vehicles grew with monotonous regularity. It became evident that the only way to regain the initiative from the rebels was by taking steps against the villages from which they came These took the form of searches for arms and wanted men by troops and police and, being fairly severe in nature, had also a punitive effect which began to produce most satisfactory results in the more truculen villages.26th - 51st May 44816-1 12 The re-organisation of areas into battalion commands, coupled with the advent of the armed bands, had increased the calls for aircraft, and by the end of the month the Headquarters and two more flights of No,fi (Bomber) Squadron had left Egypt and concentrated at Ramleh. Simultaneoi ly No. 17 Ocy. R.A«S.C., from Cairo, moved into Northern Palestine. The centre of activity now returned once more to Jaffa. There the Old City, long a hotbed of revolt and lawlessness, had become virtually a citadel from which a hail of bombs and shots greeted any attempt to enter its tortuous alley-ways. To comb out the city with troops would clearly have meant the use of considerable force and consequent heavy casualties, which was not agreeable to the civil authorities. An alternative plan was therefore adopted which comprised four phases the first of which was carried out on the night of the 30th. This * consisted of a retaliatory shoot with Vickers guns and rifle grenades after due warning, on those houses from which fire had been directed/ ihe effect was conclusive, and the second phase followed shortly after wards. This included the clearing of obstructions in the approaches to the Old City by forced labour under military and police supervision. For some two weeks after this there was little further trouble, and the two final phases were not yet put into operation. The month ended with the widespread campaign of violence unabated the 28th Jewish victim and a British constable falling to murderers’ ’ bullets on the last two days. Calls upon the troops for defensive duties had arisen alarmingly and simultaneously the armed band activities weie spreading southwards. An increase in the striking forces avail able for offensive work was plainly necessary, and on the 31st the Air Officer Commanding accepted the offer of further reinforcements from Egypt. 1st - 2nd June O-wvcAiuueuAu lurces in particular / + T:nat the y were immune from the ' a arm ud forces were having their or which the country in general and the were o pay dearly in the ensuing months.44816-1 13 The other setback, though more alarming at first, did not in the end have such far-reaching consequences. On the 1st June the Inspector- General informed Air Vice Marshal Peirse that serious incidents were taking place in the police barracks in Jerusalem and Nablus and that he could no longer rely upon the loyalty of the Arab police. There was even a risk of their going over to the rebels with their arms. On the receipt of this information the Air Officer Commanding and the O.C. British Troops interviewed the High Commissioner, and recommended the immediate reinforcement of one infantry brigade and the adoption of repressive measures accompanied by Martial Law. This was not entirely acceptable to the High Commissioner, who asked for and receivea permission to continue a policy of ’’reasonable moderation”; though the reinforcement was agreed upon, and Emergency Regulations were later introduced which gave increased pov/ers to H.M. Forces and prescribed heavy penalties for sabotage and shooting etc. It was unfortunate that these penalties were seldom enforced, for by reason of this the legislation failed entirely to achieve the objects for which it had been enacted. Meanwhile it had fortunately been possible to avert the threatened police mutiny, but from that point onwards the loyalty of the Arab section in general was always suspect and they ceased to all intents and purposes to be of any further value in the suppression of the rebellion. There were of course individual exceptions, and it is worthy of note that the Arab police continued throughout to carry on the normal routine duties of peace time. 3rd -7th June Some anxiety was now being caused by the considerable smuggling o arms and armed men across the Syrian and Trans-Jordan frontiers, anci measures had to be taken to prevent it. On the 2nd instructions had been given to the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force to form a cordon of cavalry and M.T. patrols from Metulla to the Dead Sea, and on the 4th the T.J.F.F. Reserve v/as embodied to assist in this task.' It was arrange that the police should watch the Syrian frontier from Metulla westwards to the sea, while French cavalry co-operated on the other side of one border. At sea the 3rd Cruiser Squadron (Rear Admiral G.H.D 0 Lyon, C.B.), based at Haifa, undertook destroyer patrols along the coast and posted naval ratings in the Customs House at Haifa. Other naval _ ratings with railway experience had already been landed to act as tram guards with a view to becoming available as train crews should circum stances require it. The anti-smuggling cordon left open tne desert approaches from the South, and it was not until about a month after the arrival of the 8 th Hussars, that troops could be spare or this region. About this time the Government became active in the arrest and intern ment of agitators, and on the 7th June the Secretary of the Higher Committee joined some fifty others in an Internment Camp in Sinai. After that a continual flow of internees was maintained and later tne camp was moved to Sarafand, but it was significant that neither tne Mufti nor his principal henchmen ever found their way there. Tne week of June ended with riots in Haifa and something approaching a pitched battle between troops and an armed band on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Wn it hid resulted from au ambush on the Jaffa road just before dark, the band this time opening fire from some old Turkish trenches on a convoy of Jewish buses. The Lewis gun of the police escort jammed, but reinforcements from Jerusalem were soon on the scene. ^ile attempting to close with the retreating enemy a private of the Cameron Highlanders was wounded.8th - 11th June During the next four days the new reinforcements from Egypt arrived.. They comprised the Headquarters of the 15th Infantry Brigade with the 1st Bn. The York and Lancaster Regt., the 2 nd Bn. The Cheshire Regt., the 2nd Bn. The Dorsetshire Regt., and the 2nd Field Coy. K.E. ±his increase necessitated a complete re-organisation oi the garrison, and the former four battalion areas became two brigade areas. The loth Inf. Bde», with the Loyals, Y. and L.R., and Seaforth, was allotted to the North with HQ at Haifa; while a Southern Brigade was improvised with HQ at Jerusalem and comprised R.S. Fus. , Dorsets, and Camerons. j-ne Bedfs. and Herts. R., with the R.A.F. Lifting Coy., and the tanks were retained as HQ Troops; while the Cheshires, the two field companies and the R.H.A. trolley detachment 'were formed into a special railway troops organization under HQ, Lines of Communication, at Haifa. Simultaneously the personnel of Air HQ and HQ British Troops amalgamated to form a Combined Force Head quarters Staff, which approximated to that of a Division. Meanwhile the daily crime sheet had become a regular feature rarely varying in length or severity, and only some particularly dastardlj outrage or sanguinary encounter between troops and armed bands marked the normal toll of murder, sabotage, shooting and bombing. On the 3th June the explosion of a Mills bomb in a crowded market at the Jaffa gate of Jerusalem claimed 26 victims; and on the 10th and 11th Jewish settlers in the Valley of Jezreel, aided by military and police rein forcements, were compelled to beat off serious Arab attacks. Amoushing of convoys was now of frequent occurrence, and on the 11 th tanks were in action with a Seaforth striking force near Tulkarm. 12th - 17th June The new Government Defence Regulations, which have already been referred to, came into effect on the 12th. They prescribed the death penalty for a long list of the more serious offences, but on no occasion was this ever carried out and in fact there was no noticeable improvement in the punishment of wrong-doers. The effect of this new legislation was entirely negative, and its introduction v/as greeted by a bomb outrage in the Haifa-Lydda train, which injured 18 passengers, and the attempted murder of a British Police officer in Jerusalem by a Government school teacher. It was now plain that the armed bands had become the outstanding military problem: where they had numbered 15-20 before they were now being encountered in parties of 50-70, while their enterprise and effici ency was clearly improving, especially in the Jenin-Nablus-Tulkarm triangle. To meet this menace a new system of co-operation between aircraft and troops was devised, and met with marked success. From the 15th June onwards wireless vehicles accompanied all convoys and patrols, providing direct communication to air striking forces at Ramleh and Jisr Al Mejami. Immediately on locating enemy resistance the W/T vehicle (which was later known as a M R0DEX M ) sent out an M XX M call which could summon aircraft of the striking force to any part of the country within half-an-hour. The 5 r XX ! ' system developed to a very high state of efficiency and became one of the most prominent features of the rebellion. It is described in detail in Chapter 12. Its introduction in June solved to a great extent the difficult problem of the moment, which was that of bringing armed bands to action; and during the ensuing months it was the means of inflicting upon them the heav;y casualties from which their superior mobility and knowledge of the country had hitherto kept them immune. By the end of June aircraft had answered fourteen M XX M calls. 44816-1 1418th - 20th June 44816-1 15 On the 18th interest returned yet again to Jaffa: the effect of the retaliatory shoot on the 30th May now appeared to be wearing off and the bombings and shootings had been resumed. It was therefore decided to put into effect Phase 3 of the punitive measures. During the preceeding forty-eight hours the inhabitants of the Old City had been warned to evacuate their homes, and at 4 a.m, the 2nd and 42nd Field Companies, R.E., covered by the 1st Bn. R.S. Fus., forced an entry into the city. It was found to be entirely deserted and demolition work was started at once. By nightfall a road ten metres wide had been driven right through from one side of Jaffa to the other, and the troops then withdrew. Later, on the 29th and 30th June, the fourth and last phase of the Jaffa operation was completed when a north and south circular road was blown through the Old City, again without opposition. At about the same time a notorious quarter of tin shanties, known as M Iin Town”, was demolished amid a deafening clatter by the simple process of driving tanks across it after its occupants, mostly Haurani thugs, had been deported to their native Syria. The Jaffa operations put an end forever to the use of the Old City as a citadel of lawlessness and refuge of fugitives from justice, and for the remainder of the revolt there was no further trouble from the citizens of Jaffa. The punitive effect of these demolitions was largely lost by the civil government’s assertion that they were being carried out as part of a town planning scheme. An official communique announced on the 17th that Advantage is being taken of the presence in Palestine of Royal Engineers” to ’’improve the O l d City of Jaff a” 'to the benefit of that quarter •' This deceived nobody and discouraged the loyal population - especially as compensation v/as paid to displaced inhabitants, some of whom had spent the last two months shooting at troops and police. By this time the rebellion had accounted for 700 casualties of all sorts, including 10 British: there had been 1500 convictions in the courts; 81 Arab leaders had been interned; and collective fines had been imposed upon 30 villages. 21st - 50th June With the close of the month of June came the first of the series of regular engagements between troops and the larger bands, mostly in the Nablus area, which were to continue throughout the ensuing three months on an ever increasing scale. The great majority bore the same characteristics: most of them started with an attack on a convoy and ended with the arrival of aircraft and reinforcements rushed to the scene in response to a call from the wireless lorry of the escort. Where the enemy managed to escape heavy casualties it was usually due to darkness overtaking the action before the reinforcing aircraft and troops could strike. There is little or no twilight in Palestine, and in the summer months darkness falls very suddenly soon after 7 p.m. The first of the major actions took place near Tulkarm on the afternoon of Sunday the 21st June, when aircraft and troops inflicted 50$ casualties on a band of between 50 and 60 Arabs. A Royal Scots Fusilier in the convoy escort was killed and two others wounded, while the Seaforth striking force lost a Sergeant killed. The action lasted over four hours. The previous evening the Seaforth Highlanders had succeeded in rounding up and capturing a small band of snipers in the hpqq overlooking their camp at Nablus. The following da^ the oheshire Regiment killed five Arabs who were attacking the railway.44816*.! 16 Convoys were attacked again on the 24-th and 25th, the latter leading to another engagement v/ith a large band, this time south of Nablus. It resulted in 9 enemy dead and 2 wounded, while the Seaforth High landers lost a N.C.O. killed. On the 26th another action was fought in the same neighbourhood as a result of an attack on a telegraph line repair party. Eight Arabs were killed, two wounded, and six taken prisoner, while two Cameron Highlanders were wounded and an aircraft was hit by rifle fire. Attacks on the railway were now occurring daily, and on the evening of the 25th a train was wrecked and attacked by armed Arabs, resulting in the death of a Private of the Cheshire Regt. and the wounding of another. Further attacks on convoys and trains were made on the 28th and 29ti and three British constables were wounded. The increasing calls for road protection had resulted in serious overworking of the armoured cars, and it became necessary to ask for a mechanized cavalry regiment from Egypt. Accordingly the 8 th King’s Royal Irish Hussars with a number of Ford Y 8 ’’pick-ups” left Cairo on the 26th, travelling by road across the Sinai Desert, and reached Jerusalem on the 28th. The following day the Air Striking Force at Ramleh was increased with the arrival of one flight of No.33 (Bomber) Squadron from Egypt, and work was started at Gaza aerodrome with a view to accommodating there later the whole of No. 33 Squadron. :l ■ ;44816-1 17 CHAPTER 3 A SHOR T HISTORY OF THE REBELL ION. II -~ FROM THE 1 ST JULY 19 56 TO THE EED QP THE YEAR. 1 st - 4th July At the beginning of July it seemed for a day or two that the deter mination of the Arabs was weakening under the strain. The tendency was however checked immediately by the Higher Committee through intensive propaganda and intimidation, while now it was preached from the mosques, on orders of the Mufti of Jurusalem, that the rebellion had become a religious war to save the Holy places of Islam from the Jews. In point of fact the hoped-for 11 jehad 1 * never materialised, owing to a great extent to the sensible counsels of the Amir of Trans-Jordan, but the threat of it brought into view two possible contingencies. These were disaffec tion in Trans-Jordan and a general strike of all Arab Government officials and police in Palestine. Both were fortunately avoided, though many of the Arab officials and most of the police adopted an attitude of passive resistance so far as the rebellion was concerned. But the possibility of these added dangers still remained, and it was plain that either would require additions to the garrison. The end of the Abyssinian War and the consequent easing of tension in the Mediter ranean heralded the early relief of many of the troops then concentrated in Egypt, and arrangements were made for a further increase of the troops in Palestine. Meanwhile there were a few days of comparative lull in the country, accompanied by information that ex-officers from Syria and Trans-Jordan were busy re-organising the rebel bands. The period was also marked by a bitter censure of the Administration by the British Chief Justice in a High Court case arising from the Jaffa demolitions. In remitting costs the Chief Justice went so far as to say that 'The Petitioner '. (an Arab householder in the Old City), ' has done a public service in exposing what I am bound to call the singularly disingenuo us lack of moral courage displayed by the Administration in the wh ole matter. ' Not unnaturally this did much to hearten the opposition, and similar cases were at once taken to law. 5th - 7th July By now a recent re-organisation of the Intelligence service began to take effect, and information came in regarding the location^of an important band in the area south-west of Nablus, Plans were immediately drawn up for a widespread drive of the neighbourhood, and this started on the night of the 5th July. Pour battalions and the 8 th Hussars took part as well as the Air Striking Force and one and a half companies of R.A.P. armoured cars, and the operation lasted until the morning of the 7th. Unfortunately secrecy was lost from the start and there was a general burying of arms and going to ground of all rebels. Practically no opposition was offered and no maternal results were obtained, but after-events were to prove that the moral effect had been very consider able. The inaccessible areas covered by the drive had not been visited by troops since the Great War and the inhabitants had seldom seen even British Administrative officers: the fact remains that from the date of the operation the district gave little further trouble for the rest of the rebellion. This operation was known as 'Operation X', and is described in further detail in Chapter 15. The casualties were 7 Arabs killed, 5 wounded and 1 captured, while a Private of the Seaforth High landers was killed and an officer of the R.A.S.C. seriously wounded.8th - 11th July 44816-1 18 After ’’Operation X”, it was decided to abandon the village searches which hsd outlived their usefulness! they were ■always distasteful to the troops and furthermore gave rise to unne cess ary malicious propaganda., lia their place the milits.ry authorities presseu for the greater use of other punitive measures including demolitions already legalised under the Defence Order-in—Council^ but some time was ^o elapse before these were to be applied in full. Meanwhile it had been found that hidden dumps of old war-time ammunition were providing an endless source of material for the bombs and mines which were being manufactured xndus*» triously throughout the country. Searches were made for these dumps and some 2,500 shells were destroyed by the Royal Engineers - mostly 6 -inch and 18-pr. At this time the garrison was strengthened by further assistance ashore from the Third Cruiser Squadron, and with the naval landing parties came the first artillery to be brought into action against the rebels. This consisted of 2-pr. pom-pom guns and searchlights mounted in hired lorries. The first one went into action on the night of the 9th, and proved an immediate success. The R. Navy also fitted out and manned two armoured trains, which were now put into use. Another weapon which made its appearance in July was a 3-pr. gun mounted on a lorry, manned by a detachment of Royal Artillery released from the Fixed Defence-s of Haifa on the conclusion of*the 'Italian Emergency'. It was later taken over by the Navy when the Haifa Heavy Battery was v/ithdrawn to England early in August. Two Battalions were now in pos session of mortars, and these had been adapted successfully to fire from a lorry. On the 11 th July, No. 33 (Bomber) Squadron, less the flight already at Ramleh, moved from Egypt to Amman and was later concentrated at Gaza. 12th - 16th July The reinforcements which the A.O.C. had asked for at the beginning of the month were now arriving. The armoured cars of the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert’s Own) came by train from Cairo between the 14th and 16 th and were allotted to the Northern Brigade, all R.A.F. armoured cars then being concentrated in the South. On the 18th the 'Neuralia' from Malta brought the 2nd Bn. The Lincolnshire Regiment, the 2 nd Bn. The South Wales Borderers, and a Brigade Signal Section. The tv/o infantry battalions were allotted to the North and South respectively, thus hr lap ing each Brigade up to a strength of four battalions. Nov/ at last the strength of the garrison was sufficient to provide some striking forces for offensive purposes without weakening the defence of vulnerable points and communications. The latter were soon protected in places by picquets, while convoy escorts were strong enough to ensure, in con junction with the Air Striking Force, very hard hits against any rebels encountered. Though hostile opposition v/as hardening, the authorities now felt confident that any armed concentration could rapidly 'be brought to action and heavily punished. In the meantime attacks on trains and convoys and acts of violence of all sorts continued incessantly, and the lists of casualties on both sides were growing steadily. 5 members of the British Forces, 41 Jews and some 150 Arabs had been killed, and more than twice that number seriously injured, while the damage to Jewish property alone amounted t0 more ^Ean ^zOOjOOO, On the 13th an action was fought near Jenin by the Loyals and R. signals following upon an attack on a telegraph line repaii party, and 8 Arabs were killed. The same day an aircraft dropped four 20-lb bombs on a band near Qalqilya causing considerable casualties, of which four deaths were definitely confirmed; while three more were killed and several wounded in -an action near Safad. Two officers were wounded on the Jerusalem-Nablus road on the 15thduring a night ambush by a band of some 60 rifles, and this brought the list of military and H.A.F. casualties to just under 50. On the night of the 16th the Dorsets detachment in Hebron, which had been suffering from troublesome sniping of the billets, carried out a successful ambush and killed a prominent local leader of fanatical character in a fierce hand-to-hand struggle: a collective fine of £ 2,000 was also imposed upon the town. 17th - 51st July Two further reinforcing units, released from Egypt on the withdrawal of Italian forces from Libya, reached Palestine before the end of July. 19 Coy. R.A.S.C. arrived by road on the 20th and assumed the duties o providing tactical transport for infantry in the Jerusalem ar ^* p 1 ® second unit was 'A” Coy. 1st Anti-Aircraft Bn. R.E. which was allotted to the HQ Troops, while its lights were distributed in sections over a wide area of the country to assist in counter-measures against snipers and saboteurs on the railway line and the Iraq Petroleum Company 3 pipe-lme, which had several times been punctured by rifle fire and set alight. The situation in the G-aza area was starting to give cause for anxiety, and it was evident that arms smugglers were making good use ol the desert gap at the southern end of the cordon. ^ It was an area P a ^' ticularly suited to the Ford pick-ups of the 8 th Hussars, ana on tne 30 July the Regiment, less a squadron retained at Jerusalem, was movea o Gaza and Beersheba and the area placed under the Regimental Commander. Two platoons of infantry, a section of sappers and a searchlight detach ment were added to its garrison. Several more important engagements took place before the end of July. On the 20th a convoy was fired upon near the Inn of the Good Samaritan on the Jerusalem- Jericho road. It was escorted by a few military guards and one aircraft. The aircraft promptly a^tac^ed -..nth machine-gun fire and 20 -lb. bombs and inflicted seven known causaltxes, all of whom were killed. In the early morning of the 22 nd a patrol o. the newly-arrived Lincolnshire Regiment was ambushed from uhe dense groves bordering the min road near Tulkarm and suffered five casualties, including one Private killed. On the 26th an action on the Jerusalem- Jaffa road provided an excellent demonstration of troops ana aircraf working in close co-operation. The aircraft which was called to the scene of the engagement indicated the location of a small band then retiring among the hills; and while the troops manoeuvred for position the aircraft pinned the enemy with bombs, until a aetachment of the Dorsets was able to close with the bayonet. The bombs had already accounted for two of the band, nine more were killed by the troops, while one succeeded in escaping v/ith slight wounds: -here were n casualties among the Government forces. A small band was successfully routed near Nablus on the 27th, and on the 28th two further actions took place in the same neighbourhood. Over 30 casualties were inflicted upon the Arabs, stable was killed. Other events before tne end of tbe “onth were th announcement on the 30th of the composition and terms of reference of the Royal Commission which was to visit Palestine as soon as order was restored; and a particularly horrible bomb outrage at ^lAviV. to the morning of the 23rd an Arab threw a Bomo into a crowu oi chil ranging in age from 7 to 13 as they were leaving the courtyard of a Yemenite Jewish religious school; 9 of the chxld^n were injured, and a worse disaster was only averted by the bomb accidentally hitting the fence and rebounding out of the courtyard into the street. Further legal difficulties were meanwhile arising out of the application of punitive measures under the Emergency Regulations, an on the 30th July the High Court, composed as in the cases of tne Jaffa 44816-1 1944816-1 20 demolitions of the Chief Justice and the Senior Puisne British Judge, declared the imposition of a collective fine on the town of Gaza to le illegal. Similar types of action by the Judiciary were now causing the gravest apprehension and offered to the rebels weapons which they were quick to use; the results did much to counteraco many of the measures taken by troops and police to restore order. 1st - 6 th August The 1st August saw the release from gaol of 18 Arabs who had been sentenced to death for murders committed during the 1929 riots, but whose sentences had been remitted by the High Commissioner. It was an untimely moment to set loose in the country criminals of this type, and three murders — including that of a police inspector - and two more attempts on the day following the release served as an ugly reminder. Nevertheless the first five days of August witnessed a noticeable fallin off in the daily acts of violence. This coincided with an attempt by the Amir of Trans-Jordan to mediate between the Higher Committee and the Palestine Government. The Mufti of Jerusalem however, always jealous of the Amir’s influence among the Moslems of Palestine, adopted a ho stilt attitude from the start, and negotiations ended in failure. Pith their end came a great revival of hostile activity of all forms, which increas; steadily until it reached its peak about the end of the month. 7th - 10th August On the 8 th a new and dangerous situation suddenly arose which took everyone by surprise. Almost every employee in the docks, railways, and oil depots of Haifa suddenly went on strike. It was soon found that this was the immediate result of intimidation following upon a flood of missives signed by the ’’Black Hand”, and for a day or two it looked as though it was about to spread to the remaining loyal v/orkers all over the country. It was a highly critical situation, and instant efforts to break the strike and protect the loyal elements were impera tive. All available reserves were rushed to Haifa, landing parties were put ashore from the Third Cruiser Squadron, and trains were run by H.N. and R.E* crews. Fortunately these energetic measures proved successful, and in about a week Haifa had gone back to work and the danger had passed. Actions with armed bands were now renewed on an increased scale, and it was clear that the leaders had not been idle during the few days lull. On the 7th, following an attack on a convoy near Nablus, aircraft and troops inflicted 23 casualties with one officer being slightly wounded only. On the 10th picquets of the Lincolns were attacked near Tulkarm, and later in the day further action developed in the Nablus area. 11 Arabs were killed and 4 captured, but the Seaforth lost an officer killed and 3 men wounded when a car was blown up by a road mine on the outskirts of Nablus. This resulted in the imposition of a io5,000 collective fine on the town. The same afternoon two unarmed Airmen were lired upon in Jerusalem. One was killed and the other v/ounded. It was the first time the town terrorists had turned their attention to troops, though prominent Arabs of moderate opinion had recently been added to their victims as well as Jews and police. The 10th closed with an action on the Posh Pinna-Tiberias road between a band about 40 strong and a York and Lancaster convoy escort: three soldiers were wounded and some twenty casualties inflicted upon the enemy, while the T.J.F.F. reinforcements which followed them up later scored further successes, though nightfall enabled the Arabs to remove all but one of their dead.11th - 19th Augus t 44816-1 21 On the 12 th August a section of mechanised 3.7-in. hov/itzers of the Chestnut Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, reached Nablus from Cairo to relieve two naval howitzers which had been sent there from H.M. S. ' Suss ex' on the 3rd August for action against snipers in the rocky hillsides over looking the camp. The period was marked by an increase in the murderous outrages, though there were no major engagements with the armed bands. On the 12 th a small party of the York and Lancaster Regiment were surprised and overwhelmed by a large band of Arabs v/hile bathing in a pool near Beisan. A Lance-Corporal maiming a Lewis Gun was killed, the gun captured and three Privates wounded. The whole thing was over in a moment before the remaining half dozen bathers could reach their rifles. On the 13th an entire Jewish family were murdered in their sleep in Safad; and the next day four Jewish occupants of a car, including a girl of 19, were shot dead in Haifa. The much-respected Arab liayor of Hebron and also a Jewish electrician of Tel Aviv were further victims of the day's murders. On the 16th a bomb was thrown from a train passing the level crossing in a crowded main street of Tel Aviv: a boy of 7 was killed and 24 of the Jewish crov/d vraunded. On the 17th three young Jewish girls were shot dead outside the Government Hospital in Jaffa. This act did more than anything to rouse public indignation, since two of the girls were nurses who had heroically continued their work in the dangers of Jaffa nursing Arabs regardless of race or creed. The feelings which had been aroused by these incidents led to some reprisals, and the Jewish leaders were having serious difficulty in keep ing the younger elements in hand. It looked as though a dangerous inter racial conflict might ensue at any moment. In consequence the Air Officer Commanding pressed once again for a declaration of Martial Law, indicating the measures he proposed to institute for the restoration of order and the additional forces required to carry them out. The latter were to depend upon the agreement of His Majesty's Government to an air control plan submitted to the High Commissioner on the 20th; failing agreement to this a forecast was made of further military reinforcements which would be necessary to restore peace. 20th - 29th August A strange interlude now occurred which was to have far-reaching effects in the political and military spheres. About this time two prominent Iraqis left Baghdad for Palestine. One, Nuri Pasha Ali Said, the Foreign Minister, came in a British service aircraft and stayed at Government House; v/hile the other Fauzi A1 Quwaqji, a notorious ex-officer of the Syrian and Iraqi armies, crossed the Jordan secretly at dead of night and made for the Nablus hills. Thereafter both entered into negotiations with the rebel leaders; though while Fauzi was given command of the rebels and started to reorganize them and improve their fighting powers, Nuri Pasha ostensibly sustained the role of a neutral peacemaker. In this he was unsuccessful, and on the eve of his departure an incident occurred wliich confirmed the strong suspicions as to his real motives which had been present in military circles throughout. On the 30th the Higher Committee published a manifesto in which Nuri Pasha was represent ed as acting for the Arab Kings and Princes, and announcing that complete agreement had been reached regarding the intervention to be undertaken by the Iraq Government. Meanwhile the campaign of violence continued unabated and it was clear that the Mufti had been using the recent negotiations as a cover for the entry of adherents and arms for the armed bands from Iraq, Syria and Trans-Jordan. After Fauzi’s arrival the bands soon demonstrated more effective leadership and organization, v/hile the extension of their44816-1 22 sphere beyond the areas of* habitual activity showed ohat their numbers had increased. On the 20th and 21 st the Loyals^ with aircr if t in ,sup port, fought actions in the Jenin area which resulted in 44 rebel casual ties, most of which were inflicted by aircraf ^• et- tne 2 drd und 26 th further actions ensued causing additional Arab casualties, ^il© only one British soldier was slightly wounded during the week. On ^ne ^9th, however, two privates of the York and Lancaster Regiment were billed in an attack on a convoy near Affula. To strengthen measures already taken to prevent infiltration of recruits for the armed bands from Syria, the French authorities completed on the 23rd a strong military cordon encircling the Syrian frontiers with both Palestine and iruns-Jordan. This helpful action was to have a most satisfactory effect. 50th August - 2 nd Sentember The threat of inter-racial strife earlier in the month had led the Air Officer Commanding to ask for further reinforcements to increase the garrison to a total of three Brigades, and on the 30th the Iso King s Own Scottish Borderers from Malta arrived at Haifa. Next day the Headquarters of the 13th Infantry Brigade came from Egypt, and On the 5th September formed the Nazareth Brigade, talcing over the York and Lancaster Battalion, the K.O.S.B.; and also the T.J.F.F. detachments in the former Jordan area. On the last day of August the Air Officer Commanding telegraphed a short appreciation of the situation to the Air Ministry in wrhich he prophesied a deterioration of the situation as a consequence of the Nuri negotiations, re-affirmed his conviction that martial lav/ remained the only means of restoring order, and asked for a fourth infantry brigade to be held ready for early despatch to Palestine. An official casualty list published at this time showed that 261 killed and 1163 wounded had passed through the hospitals, 19 of the dead belong ing to the armed forces; while it was known that many more Arab killed and wounded lay buried or concealed in the villages. The Arabs always took the greatest care to remove their dead in order to avoid identifi cation, while few of the wounded ever reached hospitals: it was there fore difficult to assess rebel losses which usually far exceeded the casualties accounted for officially. 3rd 7th S eptember On the 3rd September the manoeuvres of the 1st Division in Sussex were suddenly ended and the troops returned in haste to Aldershot. That night information reached Jerusalem that the Cabinet had decided to send an emergency Force to Palestine, that Lieutenant-General J. G. Dill, CB. CMG. LSO. had been appointed to the supreme command, that there was to be no extension of existing authorisation of air bom bardment, that martial lav/ would be put into force at an opportune time, and that military measures would be intensified. Martial Law was in fact never to be applied, but the last clause was put into effect at once, and punitive measures thereafter became far more effective. The 3rd September saw the biggest engagement which had yet taken place and v/hich came to be known as the Battle of Bala. The rebels, who were in unusually large numbers, were commanded by Fauzi A1 Quwaqji in person and showed far greater skill and determination than ever before. The engagement started with attacks on the picquets of the Lincolns to the Last of Tulkarm about 8.30 a.m. : aircraft were soon on the scene and assisted in driving the enemy back on the village of Bala in v/hich they attempted to make a stand. Meanwhile the advances of the Lincolns striking force from Tulkarm and the R.S. Fus. striking force from Nablus, both v/ith tanks, armoured cars and a naval pom-oom, were strenuously opposed. The action continued throughout the day until Bala was carried at 3.50 p.m., when the rebels dispersed into difficult hill country pursued by aircraft and headed off by tanks. The aircraft,44816-1 23 which made fourteen sorties in all, suffered heavily from rifle fire; four were hit, one being shot down with the loss of both occupants, an officer and an aircraft-sman, while another managed to land safely at Tulkarm with the pilot badly wounded. Army casualties were an N.C.O. killed and tv/o officers and two other ranks wounded. Fourteen rebel casualties were accounted for, and it is known that others were carried away when they retreated. Just as the Battle of Bala was drav/ing to its close a patrol of the Loyals met an Arab band south of Jenin and inflicted nine casualties. Meanwhile a train had been blown up by a large mine near Qalqilya, killing two Drummers of the Cheshire Regiment and the Arab driver and injuring two naval ratings. On the 5th an evening air recon naissance detected 41 rebels constructing sangars on the hills outside Nablus under the protection of 15 armed men: air action was immediately taken and five aircraft were on the scene before dark. 15 casualties were inflicted before the light failed. On the 7th came the announcement by the British Government that the 1st Division and other troops were to be despatched to Palestine, and that drastic measures including martial law would be taken to restore or der. This appeared to surprise the rebel leaders: it brought Nuri’s negotiations to an end, and from that day onwards there was a marked decrease in violence. It provided a clear demonstration of the invari able reaction of the Arab to any show of strength by those in authority. About the same time Fauzi, as 'General Commander of the Arab Rebel lion in Southern Syria', issued the third of his ' official communiques _': in it he gave a flamboyant account of the Battle of Bala, confirming the death of nine terrorists including a 'hero' of the Druse rebellion of 1925 and revealing the presence of organized detachments of Iraqis (' excellent in organization and firing '), Syrians and Druses. 8 th - 12th September During the first week in September Fauzi succeeded in visiting the Arab leaders in Jerusalem. On the 9th armed bands became active in the district bordering the Syrian frontier. Two actions ensued, booh of which started with the ambushing of mail vans. In an engagement near Acre 37 casualties were inflicted upon the rebels, mostly by aircraft, while a Corporal of the York and Lancaster Regiment and two police con stables were killed. Three Privates of the same Regiment and a Pales tinian ooliceman were also wounded. The same evening troopo going the scene of an attack on a mail van near Rosh Pinna found a police tender with the bodies of four British constables who had been overwhelmed in an ambush. The tender had apparently gone out independently and the Lewis Gun and rifles of the small party had fallen into the hands of the rebels: the band was engaged later but darkness intervened and facilitated their escape. On the 11th a band was engaged near Haifa on the slopes of Mount Carmel when a Sergeant of the Loyals and a Private of the K.O.S.B. were killed; while in the South below Gaza several cars of the 8 th Hussars had been blown up by land mines, though fortunately on each occasion the occupants escaped lightly. Other activities which were particularly intense about this time included sabotage of the Iraq pipe-line and uhe Jerusalem water supply. 15th - 15th Septe mber Lieutenant-General Dill, with his 3.G.S. and D.A. and Q.K.G., reached Haifa on board H.i.1.3. 'Do ugla s' on the 15th and went on at once by air to Jerusalem. On the 15th he took over command of the Forces in Pales Line and Trans-Jordan from Air Vice Marshal Peirse, and set up Headquarters in the King David Hotel. Meanwhile units in Egypt which were to form par44816-1 24 of the Emergency Force started to move into Palestine, and a base v/as prepared at Haifa under the direction of the b-.ChG., British iroops in Egypt. Between the 9 th and 15th the 17th Field Coy. R.-S. vin relief of the 2nd Coy.), the 9th Field Coy., and the 7th Field Hygiene Section arrived in Palestine, followed a few days later by a company and a half of the 2nd Bn. the Royal Berkshire Regiment, which vrere c-o act as Base troops, the No. 5 and 49 Ccys. R.A.S.C. and the 4th Field Ambulance. 16th - 22nd September % the 18th September General Dill had become thoroughly convinced that the earliest possible declaration of martial lav/ throughout the whole of Palestine was unquestionably demanded. To ensure that its full effect should be felt from the start, it was hov/ever decided to post pone the declaration until all civil and military preparations had been completed. The latter included the deployment of the bulk of the Emergency Force, and set the earliest date at the 4th October. The week following General Dill’s arrival was on the whole a quiet one. On the 16 th there was a clash near Safad between troops and an Aral band, and on the 22 nd there was a heavier attack on a detachment of the York and Lancaster Regiment in the same area: on both occasions casual ties were inflicted on the rebels, v/hile in the latter action a Lance- Corporal was killed. On the 22 nd two 4 . 5 -in. howitzer batteries of the 20th Field Brigade R.A. arrived from Egypt. One battery went to Nablus while the other remained in HQ reserve in Jerusalem: a third battery had already been sent up in July to relieve R.H.A. crews on the railv/ay trolleys. The 45th Field Battery at Nablus was in action very soon after arrival, actually firing from its gun-park in the town. On the 22 nd also the 3 rd Cruiser Squadron, which had rendered such excellent assistance ashore in the past two months, left Haifa where its duties were taken over by the battleship ’’ Valiant ”. 23rd September - 4th October Before the end of the month the Royal Air Force was reinforced by No. 208 (A.C. ) Squadron from Egypt; while the 2/3 Cavalry Field Ambulanc: and the 3rd Motor Ambulance Convoy also moved up into Palestine. Mean while the greater part of the Emergency Force from England landed at the port of Haifa and moved safely to its allotted stations. Its composition is given in detail in Appendix I: briefly it comprised a Corps HQ and certain Corps Troops, the 1 st Division less its artillery, and the HQ and divisional troops - less artillery - of the 5th Division. Two Brigade Headquarters and five battalions of the 5th Division were already in Palestine, while the third Brigade - 14th Inf. Bde, - remained in England. The Cunard-White Star liner ’’ Laurenti c” was the first to berth on the 23rd with 1400 officers and men of the Corps and two Divisional Headquarters. She was followed next day by the troopship ’’ Dorsetshire with part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade and R.E. units, and on the 25th ty the 'Naldera' and ’’ Nevasa” with the Headquarters of the 1 st Guards Briga* and Battalions of the 2 nd and 3rd Brigades. The ’’ Neuralia ” on the 28th brought the remainder of the 2 nd Brigade, and the ’’ Van Dy ck” and ” California ” the vanguard of the 1st Brigade on the 30th September and 1 st October. There was then an interval until the 12th October, when the ’’Laurentic'' on her return voyage arrived with the Coldstream Guards and the Buffs, together with units of the R.A.S.C. and R.A.M.C., which completed the Force. With the exception of this last ship-load the whol ; Force had deployed to action stations in Palestine by the 2nd October - just inside one month from the recall from manoeuvres in Sussex.In order to leave the more seasoned troops in the most troublesome districts, General Dill had allotted the 5th Division to the Northern Area* The 1st Division moved without incident into Southern Palestine from Haifa by means of the coast railway and the main Nablus road: there was no interference, although while the move was in progress several actions with bands were fought by the 5th Division in the neighbourhood of the road. The final deployment and Order of Battle of the emergency Force is shown in Appendix II. By this time operations against armed bands were being carried ou^ on pre-arranged plans based on information, and were no longer dependent upon chance encounters. The first took place at Jab T *-, to the ^orth of Nablus, with a large force under Fauzi’s command which included a number of mounted men: detachments of two battalions of the 16th Brigade with a section of guns took part, together with five aircraft which accounted for most of the casualties. The action started at 3.10 p.m. on the 24th and, after being interrupted about 6.30, was resumed the following morning. As a result troops occupied the rebel villages of Jab* a and Tubas and inflicted 57 casualties on the enemy. One Fusilier of the R.S. Fus. was killed, and an. R.A.F. officer was wounded in the leg and compelled to make a forced landing. The same night a patrol of the Camerons had a sharp engagement near Hebron and an officer was wounded. On the 27th South Wales Borderers with tanks dispersed a band near the railway, causing several casualties, and on the 29th there was another engagement with Fauzi. Acting on information regarding his preoence in a village between Jab*a and Tubas, striking forces of three battalions of the 16th Brigade, eventually reinforced by a fourth, moved on the village about 11 a.m. accompanied by guns and tanks.^ A portion of the band was encountered near Beit Umrin and engaged until 7 p.m. Four air craft co-operated with conspicuous success and 22 casualties were inf ic ed, while an officer and private of the Dorsets and a private of the Lincolns were wounded. On the 30th the newly-arrived troops suffered their^ casualty when a Fusilier of the R. North’d Fus. //as severely woun e^ m an ambush on the Jerusalem-Jaffa road. These actions brought the known casualty list of the rebellion to 1630, 315 of which v/ere o 1 ^ en ^ lf 1 ® d ^® ad * British fighting forces and British police had suffered 28 dead a^d 136 v/ounded, while Arab dead were now estimated to be in the region of luuu. 5th - 12th Octob er Shortly after arrival General Dill had stated that he would be ready to impose martial law on the 4th October and by that date null ary preparations had been completed, while the Martial Law Order-in-Counci had been signed by King Edward on the 26th September and proclaimed on the 30th. Briefly it authorised the High Commissioner to delegate to the G-. 0 .C. at his discretion any or all of his powers. ^ did however introduce an element which came as a surprise to General bill: it cua not authorise martial law in the wide unfettered sense in which yj-S normally interpreted, but introduced instead a form of Statutory .urtia Law' in v/hich the powers conferred were meticulously defined. i-.is created an entirely new situation and led inevitably_to furtner discus sions regarding the powers which were to be delegated to ohe 3-i the relations between the civil and military authorities shou 3 ^ u ory martial law be applied. The effect of all this was to postpone the ^ possible date of application to the 10 th. When the 10th Octoter Vtf 6 however a further postponement was made by the High Comnussioner the 14th in the hopes that the Higher Committee would call off rhe rebellion before that date. This hope was realised when the higher Committee, acting on the advice of the Arab Kings and Princes cohtaaney in identical messages which arrived on the 9 th, issued orders tance to cease on the 12th October. This was instantly obeyed and the strike came to an end.44816-1 26 Meanwhile two further actions had taken place ^ of the 6 th a mrty of the Cameronians had engaged a band near dethlehem in the 6 th a ft Contact was renewed early the following co-operation with ir one of the dea a was identified as a morning and casualties mfli • turned out to be a relative noted rebel leader, an a wo official of the Government Land of the Mufti of J eru f lem T ^ a ^ t ;.;° e '* s , no t a ble success for the newly- Settlement Department. Th e ^ - gth the l6th infantry Brigade arrived 1st Division. On th ‘ Tulkarm area which resulted in 20 carried out searc course of the operation two tanks, one of which rebel casualti s. ,,, to repulse Arab attacks throughout most had broken down, were compelled to repute i of one night before reinforcements could reach them. On the 9th the_ oi one mgnu t Hebron, where three Paflemen ana Cameronians were again in action near rte oron ' ^ ^ land-mine a British Constable were wounded when a truck exploded a lana mine. On the 12th the last units of the Emergency Force landed, and the same day the 1st Bn. Seaforth Highlanders, which was destined for hong Kong left Palestine. With the end of the strike the High Commussioner issued orders that no offensive operations were to take place for seven days in order to allow time for the rebel leaders to arrange for all followers to cease the campaign of violence. 15th - 25th October The few days which followed the 12th October proved more than any thing else the efficiency of the Higher Committee's control of the rel3el | elements. The seven-day breathing space turned out to be quite unneces-.j saiy; mounted messengers reached all the bands within twenty-four hours and disorders ended the following day. As early as ohe loth general Dill was able to report that resistance had ceased, and no furtner actions occurred except for'a clash on the Syrian border on the 16th between a patrol of the Buffs and a party of 12 Druses who were probably trying to return to their own country. In the action an officer and private of the Buffs were wounded. On the 12 th General Dill issued a special order of the day which began: ' The strike and armed rebellion have been called off tn cpndltion-- ally by the Higher Arab Committee as from to-day. Th is rjqsuljts__in gre at measure due to the resolute and energetic acti on ofjjie..three Services, in spite of difficult and hampering circumsta nces . , . '. Publication of this message in the local press was prohibited by order of the High Commissioner. On the same day Fauzi A1 Qawaqji also pro duced a printed ' Communique No. 1 6'. In it he called upon his followers to cease from violence ' In compliance with the appeals of our Arab Fings_ and Emirs, and in accordance with the request of t he A rab Highe p^Corogattee in Jerusal em.' He added also an exhortation the significance of which was to be felt only too bitterly in the year which followed: 'I also. request my brethren to safeguard their arms and districts very stric tly^ and carefully: and to be ready to ansv/er the call if n ecess jty arises♦ The end of the rebellion was greeted with bonfires and fireworks in the villages and towns; while a week later, as if to act as a reminder of the grinding wheels of Palestine justice, the trial took place of eight members of the Sheikh Izz Ud Din al Kassan gang who had murdered a British policeman on the 20 th November 1935 and had been taken prisoner the same day after a brisk fight in the hills. % the 19th, with the expiration of the period of grace, came the problem of dispersing the armed bands which remained in being. A number of them had by now been located in the Jenin-Nablus-Tulkarm triangle where they were virtually in control of the villages and showed no signs of leaving. At the request of the Chief Secretary operations were started by the 16th Infantry Brigade with a view to rounding up these bands and arresting Fauzi, while more extensive drives were to start a week later. On the 22 nd Fauzi attenpted to escape into44816-1 27 Trans-Jordan and actually entered the net laid for him by the 16th Brigade. Unfortunately Arab feeling was now running high again as a result of these military activities and the High Commissioner, fearing a renewal of rebellion, issued orders for a cessation and three days later further rounding-up operations were cancelled.. Pauzi returned in somewhat triumphant style to Iraq, while his follov/ers with arms intact went back to their homes. The period which followed resembled an armed truce ratner than capitulation. The close of 1956 yith the dispersal of the bands unhampered by military action, a reduction of the garrison becarae possible. The units from agypt started to return at the end of October, and on the 4tn November one Laurentic left with the first of the Emergency Force Troops. The R.A.F. reinforce ments had left by November the 9th, and after that troops sailed for England as fast as transports could be made available. The majority were successful in reaching home again for Christmas, except for the And. Infantry Brigade and certain HQ troops which were destined to stay a further year in Palestine. So far as the enemy were concerned, the Higher Committee, against^ strong military advice, was left free to continue its subversive activi ties for nearly another year until at last it became necessary remove its members from the country and to declare it ana its subsidiaries illegal organizations. 'With it went the iauf ci of Jerusarem who fi^.d uO ^yria in female disguise, his epitaph being spoken by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons in October 1957, when he stated that the Mufti throughout his whole tenure of office - 16 years - had worked continuously against British interests. For the remainder some 1700 Arabs were convicted out of about 2700 arrested for crimes arising out of the rebellion. Of the perpetrators of the 260 murders which had been reported during the year, 67 had been convicted and 17 more were still awaiting trial. In only a very few cases had the death sentence been imposed, and in none was it ever carried out. On the 11 th November the Royal Commission arrived in Jerusalem to start its labours, and with its coming the rebellion can oe^ said to have reached its end. Its course may be compared to a fire which had smouldered for years before it suddenly burst spontaneously into flame on the 19th April. Fanned by the Mufti and his Higher Committee, the flames spread rapidly and increased in intensity. The fire had almost burnt out by the time the Fire Brigade arrived to put the finishing touches in September.44816-1 28 CHAPTER 4 CONDITIONS IE PALESTINE AS AFFECTim OPERATIONS THE SIECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OP PA^STIPE In Palestine religious and political issues are so closely inter woven as to become weJlnigh inseparable and it will be convenient to treat them as one. Their influence was felt from two directions: from outside as a consequence of world interest in a historic country specially sacred to three great religions; and from inside where two widely dissimilar sections of the population were in violent opposition, EXTERNAL POLITICAL INELbENC ES There are reasons other than history and religion why universal attention is invariably focussed upon events in Palestine. In the firs! place the United States of America and each member of the League of Nations has a direct responsibility in regard to the Mandate. Further more most of the Christian nations own property in the Holy Land and have numbers of their citizens domiciled there (there are 10,000 Americans alone); every Arab nation feels impelled to evince a special interest in matters affecting the 900,000 Arab inhabitants; while with World Jewry and every nation with a large Jewish community there is a very intimate and practical connection. The existence of the Mandate has an important influence upon the handling of any form of revolt, and methods which might be suitable and effective in a colonial possession are frequently held to be incom patible with the nature of the Mandate • The Mandate is exercised by Great Britain only on behalf of the League of Nations and in conformity with certain detailed provisions, and the Mandatory is answerable to the Council of the League for every measure talcen to carry out these provisions. Moreover there is a special duty towards the inhabitants themselves: the 1 encouragement of local autonomy * is one of the particular provisions and has been interpreted as an obligation to give the people of the country as great a hand as possible in its government. This accounts for the large proportion of Palestinian officials in every branch of the Government service, which in a colony under similar circumstances would be unnecessary and perhaps unwise. It accounts also for the reluctance to use one section of the population in armed opposition to the other - even in support of law and order. With a brief outline of these external influences it is not difficult to see why both His Majesty* s Government and the Palestine Government have always shrunk from the use of force - even to meet orce ^ in a country where the sound of every blow struck may echo throng! the civilized world. It remains to be seen what was the effect of similar influences from within. INTERNAL POLITICAL INPTJlENHT^.q The Arab Attitud e The rebellion was purely an Arab rebellion. The aims of the Arableaders had been freely stated and there is little doubt that every Arab in Palestine would have liked to see them realised, though it is probable that the majority disliked the methods chosen to attain them. But every Arab was either secretly or openly in varying degrees of sympathy with the rebels and it will be remembered that the majority of Government officials were Arabs. Though outnumbering the Jews in the country by rather less than three to one, they vastly outnumbered them in the civil service and dominated the railways, the police and the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force. Initial doubts as to their loyalty were soon confirmed when in June a memorandum was submitted to the High Commissioner by 137 senior Arab officials and judges. In it they claimed to be ' in closer contact with the inti mate thou ghts of the Arab popul ation' (whicn was then in full revolt f) 'than even Your Excellency* s cl oses t advisers ', and stated 'we. m ust c on scientiously raise a protest ag a inst the present policy of repress ion 11 . This was signed or afterwards endorsed by all the senior Arab officials with the exception of those in the Police, and was followed by a similar memorandum from 1200 Arabs in the Second Division of the Public Service, Nevertheless the majority continued to draw their pay and to carry out their duties so long as these did not contribute to the suppression of the rebellion. So far as the latter was concerned their loyalty to the Arab cause took precedence of loyalty to the Government which employed them, with the principal result that any form of secrecy in government circles became practically impossible. The nosition of the Police, which included nearly 2000 armed and trained Arabs, had a very direct bearing on the military situation. Though no Arab Police Officer signed the manifesto there had been apprehension of a strike in the lower ranks earlier in the rebellion. Their families were subjected to intimidation; they found it difficult to obtain food; and their position was intolerable. On steps being taken to meet these difficulties there was no further open trouble, but the value of the Arab policeman remained a doubtful quantity for the rest of the period. There were certainly many instances of good service under great difficulty, but in Police circles again leakage of information was noticeable and it was perhaps inevitable that the soldier never felt he could rely upon real support from the Arab section of the Police. The Trans-Jordan Frontier Force with 700 Arab soldiers remained loyal and active throughout, regarding itself primarily as the Regular Army of Trans-Jordan and therefore above participation in the political bickerings of Palestine, although many of its recruits were^ drawn from Palestine and three-fifths of the Force were employed within its borders. In semi-official and unofficial circles nearly every Arab gave the rebellion practics.1 support in some form or other. At the head oi the Higher Committee was the Mufti of Jerusalem, undouotedly the most influential Arab in Palestine, who drew a salary from the Government as President of the Supreme Moslem Council and who by virtue of this office had control of religious funds amounting to over £ 100,000 a year. Appointed by and answerable to the Mufti were the Qadis oi the Moslem S hari * a Courts who too submitted their memorandum. This was more mutinous in tone than the others. It described the Governments policy as 'detestable'; it charged the police and military with ' unimagi nable acts': ~and it warned 'the British authorities of the revenge of God tiio Almighty'. It demanded, in conclusion, ' the grant of all the de mands of ~t lie 'jirabs and the enforcement o f the pledges given to them . 11 With such an atmosphere prevalent in both official and semi-official circles, it is remarkable that the rebellion was not more wholehearted than it was; but nevertheless it was this lead that inspired the young men of a simple peasantry, urged on by bellicose elders and women and with the professional agitator ever in the background, to recover hidden arms and taJce the field.44816-1 30 The Jewish A t titude The Jews n£il 3 iir 8 . 1 ILy sided, with the Goverrnifent a.s a.ga.inst the Ara.bs } but throughout kept up a volley of vehement criticism of its moderation, Though restraining to a remarkable degree the youtntul hotheads and avoiding reprisals by strict self-discipline^ they fre toed intensely over their own inactivity and bitterly assailed txie G-oveinment for not using Jews to displace unreliable officials and to iill the gaps in the defence forces. 'Defend us or allow us to defbnd ourselves' is a natural cry and it is not surprising that the Jew shouted it from the house-tops. The political objections to such a coarse have already bee: explained, but there were also very practical difficulties. The Civil Service and the armed forces of the country had been built up upon Arabs, and there were not sufficient trained Jews to replace them. In the end, force of circumstances compelled the Government to organize the Jews in the defence of lav/ and order, and in particular a large force of Super numerary Police was raised. But by then it was too late to provide in full the organization and training necessary with a result that their real value was never properly exploded. There is little doubt that in the end the authorities benefited by the subterranean defence organiza tions which their policy had forced underground, and it might perhaps have been better to have legalised and controlled at an earlier period the very natural activities which developed below the surface. THE CHOICE OF POLICY These then were the conditions under which the Government of Palestine were called upon to formulate a policy for the suppression of the rebellion. With two-thirds of the population in open revolt, with the other third clamouring for sterner retaliation, tied by the strict provisions of the Mandate and accountable for every action to the League of Nations, the Administration were forced to deal with the situation in the full glare of world publicity and all the time with serious dissention in its own ranks. In general there were three main courses open to it. The first was to make some temporary concession to the Arabs which would enable the leaders to call off the campaign of violence and conduct negotiations in a more tranquil atmosphere. But, however disguised, this would of course have been in effect a submission to force and wa s obviously inacceptable on that account. It was rejected by His Majesty 1 s Government, with whom the decision lay. The second course was conciliation, the policy, in the words of the Palestine Government, ' of endeavour i ng to protect life and pr o perty wit hout ado pting repressive measure s' • This was the course selected by the High Commissioner and the one adopted for five out of the six months of the rebellion. The third was the policy recommended throughout by the Military Commander (The Air Officer Commanding), and finally adopted by His Majesty* s Government on 7th September, though never put filly into effect owing to the early collapse of resistance after'that date. was described as 'intensive measures designed to crush resistance' - m other words repression. ' Since similar courses will usually present themselves on other occasions, it will be worth while considering the last two in detail: the first need hardly be taken into account.44816—1 31 The Policy of Conciliat ion It is understandable that no G-overnment will adopt an immediate pbiicy of repression without considerable reluctance, but it should also be clear that unless there is a fair chance of conciliation succeeding the sooner repressive action is taken the less will be the degree of severity required and the less will the country suffer in consequence* In Palestine there v/as never any fair expectation that conciliation would succeed. It had been tried and had failed in every previous outbreak and there was no reason why 1936 should have proved any exception. The Royal Commission Report leaves little room for doubt in this report:- 'Our point, once mo re, is that conciliation, like impartiali ty, has^ failed* If the patient treatment of Arabs last year has been shar xily criticized, its critics must confess that i t had _at least this merit. It prov ed to demonstration that conciliation is no use* It has now been tried for 17 years, and at the end th e Arabs, taken as a whole, are more hostile to the Jews and much more hostile to the Government than they were at the beginning ,' There were probaoly two chief reasons for its failure. The first will always apply. The very fact that rebel leaders have resorted to violence to attain their ends is evidence that they are no longer prepared to conciliate without some concession on the part of the G-overnrnent. As a rule they dare not, and perhaps even cannot, call a halt until they receive sufficient compensation in the shape of a partial accession to their demands or can bow to an overwhelming show of force. In fact the first and third courses are really the only uractical policies for the authorities to adopt in such circumstances* In Palestine, where political murder is frequent, many of the more moderate leaders, frightened at the pace at which they were being dragged along, would have welcomed an opposition strong enough to con vince the rank and file before it was too late that further resistance was useless. It was noticeable that those leaders who were interned at an early stage were seldom dissatisfied at their personal fate* The second reason for the failure of the middle policy was the old story of the East - moderation mistaken for weakness. The Arabs, used to the repressive measures of 400 years of Turkish rule, were encouraged by the immunity with which they could commit their misdeeds. Recent events in connection with Abyssinia had not raised British prestige in their eyes, and the leaders quoted India, Ireland and Iraq as evidence that the British Empire will give way to force. 'Then violent crime continued to go unpunished or only half published they attributed it either to real weakness or to a sneaking sympathy with their cause which resulted in only half-hearted measures being taken to crush the rebellion. The latter belief was encouraged by petty successes such as successful protests against ’’excesses'’ by troops, treatment of internees etc,?which greatly enhanced the prestige of their leaders. All this not only led the malcontents to redouble their efforts, but also led many Arabs to join the rebels who might otherwise have remained aloof• The Policy of Repression It has been shewn hew the continued failure of conciliatory methods at last forced the authorities to adopt a policy of repression. It is significant that the mere announcement of the change went a long way towards ending the revolt. There is little doubt that a similar announcement at an earlier date would have saved time and the destruc tion of much life and property. In the meantime many repressive measures had crent in through force of circumstances without any out ward change of policy, and mostly they were more severe in nature than would have been necessary in the early stages had a strong front been44816-1 32 presented from the start. With many people - and especially the .Arab-, it is better to bark loud even if you are not going to bite very hard rather than to bite without barking. Repression has an ugly sound andj though it may frighten the enemy into subjection by its mere threat, it is equally lively to alarm a cautious Administration. It is a misconception of what a repressive ■policy involves which generally makes the civil autnorities reluctant to enroloy it. In oractice it is usually the more merciful of uhe two in the end, and it is imoortant to appreciate its implications. As a rule it imolies martial lav/ in some form or other , so tnat it will be convenient to consider both together. THE WEAPON OF MARTIAL LAV/ A feature of the rebellion - and this is a feature common to most serious disorders in the East - was the successful evasion of respon sibility by the leaders. The Arab Higher Committee, which v/as allowed to function freely throughout, openly preached continuance of the strike, which was legal. But they were never held responsible for the ever- increasing violence and the formation of armed bands, although it soon became clear that such activities were the results of their incitement by the Committee 1 s agents and partisans. The only ones to suffer were the rank and file. The essence of martial law is the power it gives to go to the root of the trouble - to strike at those who instigate but will not come out into the open, to curtail the licence of irresponsible leaders, and to deal severely with those who use the patriotism of others as a cloak under which to further their own ends. A declaration of martial law would have forced the rebels to realise three unpleasant facts: that the leaders would have to accept that responsibility for the consequences of their acts and words which so far they had successfully evaded, that punishment would become proportionate to the seriousness of the crime; and that vigorous military action would at last become possible. At the same time it should be realised that even vigorous military action under martial law does not necessarily entail M severe repressive measures' which at the time were so repugnant to the civil government, and the reputation of the British soldier is the best answer to those who fear that strong measures must involve brutality. The very magnitude 01 the power of martial law is the best guarantee that it will no’k used oppressively, even were that possible in the glaring light of modern puolicity. The bigger the stick the less likely is one to risK being struck by it. It would indeed be a misuse of power to use martial^ law solely to crush misled peasants. But its use to ■paralyse the activities of those who were morally responsible for the violence, incendiarism and destruction of life and property which took •place in Palestine in 1936 would have been merciful and saved much misery. This is not the place to consider in detail the reasons why martial law was never applied to Palestine, It is sufficient to record that i' was neve... declared Put, as its imposition was continuously advised y ^ e commander at ohe time, it is instinctive to consider what assistance it could have given to the conduct of the military operations. The Jar Office pamphlet ' Notes on Imperial Policing 1934' quotes five consi orations which must be borne in mind by a commander who is called upon to advise the imposition of martial law. Are military ope rations which are for the restoration ~- 7 y r ' s ' rva ^^ Qn 0x or ^-er, or for the succ ess of the camp aign, bei ng. gravei y hampered, ana can those op erations only hR narHRd outTf a( dQpte d which the existing l aw cannot enforc e, e vg«&gt; pyrfew, censorship , restrictions on circulation etc .?44816-1 35 Under this heading the urgent need for secrecy alone would have supplied the answer* The leakage in official and police circles has already been referred to, and so long as the military acted in aid of the civil power and therefore had to lay their plans before it so long were operations imperilled by lack of secrecy. Curfew certainly, and also a form of censorship was enforced by the civil power so far as the law allowed; but, to quote the opinion of the Royal Commission, H the_ penalties provided by t he Press Ordinance and the action tak en under it were insufficient to coj^e with an aggravated evil like the Palestin e Press. Restrictions on circulation were not imposed, and yet it would have^oeen of inestimable value during the operations had inhabitants of certain areas been forced to carry passes which could have been checked, say, with fingerprints. Had this been combined with legislation to force them to sleep each night in their own homes, villages could have been visited in order to round up strangers and to note absentees for apprehension and p uni slime nt • Such action would have gone a long way towards curtailing the activities of armed bands, and is one of the many ways in which martial law might have helped 'to protect life and property' without necessarily involving violence against the population. (ii) Is the existing legal system, or the authority of the existing criminal courts, inadequate to provide a deterrent against crime pr_ does the situation demand the more summary punishment of offence s^ which martial law alone can provide? There can be little dispute that the failure of the existing system under this heading alone was ample justification for the declaration of martial lav/. Here figures can be allowed to speak for themselves. To take murder alone, 260 cases were reported in 1936 of which 67 persons were convicted and yet not a single dea.th sentence was carried out. ihe Royal Commission in quoting these figures, after comparing them with the results of action taken against rioters in 1929, remarks 'in_1936^ convictions were even fewer. Yet the prompt and adequate punishment o f crime is a vital factor in the maintenance of law and order .^ Little more need be said here, and it is unnecessaiy to dwell upon the influence exerted by the Arab judges and prosecutors whose sympathies with the rebels were scarcely disguised. There are hov/ever two minor points which are worthy of note for the future. Where rebels have a substantial central fund the imposition of money fines on individual offenders is a poor deterrent, since they are cither reimbursed by the leaders or regard themselves lucky to have been able to contribute to the 'cause' by an often insignificant sum of money rather than by personal inconvenience. It was noticeable in Palestine that many members of gangs were youths of 16-18 years whom it was obviously undesirable to sentence to capital punishment or long terms of imprisonment. Here martial law might have provided a strong deterrent in the shape of corporal punishment followed by a period of employment in a special labour unit on v/ork of educational value. fiii') i s the disorder so grave, and the situation so out of han d,_ that no consideration of the loss of prestige consequent upo n^hc^ abdication of the' civil power or its supersess ion can weigh the call for immediate and drastic measures which the civil powe r cannot provide? This must always remain a matter of opinion and one on which the military commander and the civil authorities are least likely to agree. It is the civil official whose prestige is at stake^and naturally he will regard abdication with extreme distaste, especially as he will probably look upon it as a final confession of failure. A special responsibility in this direction therefore-rests upon the commander who recommends martial law, and he will be well advised to point out that if repressive measures have to be taken which may leave bitterness in their wake it is better for the soldiers to44816-1 34 undertake them rather than the civil authorities and the police who will have to live on in the country afterwards. In Palestine there is little doubt that any prestige which the civil power might have lost in giving way to military control would have been infinitely Less than that occasioned by the^ continued failure to bring the rebellion to an end. The Royal Commission Report plainly recognises this - 'Our chief recorore relation i,^_ti^t^jiQuld d isorders break out again there should oe no hesitation in en foroing martial law throughout the country under undivuded military contro l', (iv) Can the needs of the situation not be met, even at thi s junction, by closer co-operation between the military command and the~~civil officials particularly the p olice?' The attitude of the Arab officials has already been described, and since they comprised the greater part of the administration and the police there can have been little hesitation in answering .:o' to this question. (v) Is the military commander in a position to un der take the burdenwhich supersession of the civil government involves - a re his forces and staff adequate or capable of being quickl y' expanded? Martial law was first mooted in Ihlestine on the 23rd May. At that time affairs around Nablus were so bad that the civil power had virtually lost all semblance of control, and it seemed that nothing short of an immediate application of martial law to that area at least could prevent further deterioration. Under such circum stances the military commander was prepared to accept the responsi bilities, There might have been difficulties at first in its practical application, but there was a large force of potential reinforcements close at hand in Egypt - due to the ’’Italian Emergency” then nearing its end - which certainly fulfilled the provision of a capacity for quick expansion. Prom the beginning of June onwards adequate forces and staff were available and the military commander was in a position to assume control at any time. There is one lesson which may be stressed in this connection. The effect of martial law is greatly enhanced if its fullest powers can be exerted immediately on its introduction. Otherwise there will be an interval when the rebels will gain heart from a discovery that it does not appear nearly so formidable as it sounds. To make its full effect felt at once requires long and detailed preparations. The meticulous wording and subsequent printing of innumerable 'forms” alone takes time, and in any Command where martial lav/ is a possi bility it is necessary to maintain in peace a comprehensive scheme for the assumption by the military commander of the burden which may be involved by supersession of the civil government. In Palestine this had to be prepared in great haste and under the stress of a rapidly changing situation. A study of the five considerations which have been discussed must show beyond doubt that martial law would have done a great deal to facilitate military operations. In its absence they were con ducted with crippling restrictions on the use of force, with a serious lack of secrecy, with no tangible military object, and on a purely defensive basis. These last two factors may repay further examination.44 - 816-1 35 THE EFFECT OF POLICY ON THE MILITARY OPERATIONS The Military Objec t u Imperial Policing ,, describes a dual object which was directly applicable to Palestine and which was in fact quoted word for word in an Operation Instruction issued at the time:- (i) To prevent interference with the normal life of the affect ed district, i.e,, to maintain communications in operations and t q_ protect li fe and prope rty. (ii) To get to grips with the hostile elements and brinp; them into s ubjection* In Palestine these two objects v/ere in constant rivalry. Since troops were acting only in support of the civil power, their main object was selected by the civil authorities. The Palestine Govern ment, in pursuit of its policy of 'protecting life and property', gave prominence to No. (i) and until the armed bands appeared - which was not until the rebellion had run about one-third of its course - ooject No. (ii) remained chiefly one for the police. by this time so many troops were committed in pursuit of the first object tnat the attain ment of the second was beyond the power of the remainder. Again ' Imperial Polici ng' lays down that ' passive defence wil l not restore lawand or der , while e ven its temporary adoption cannot fail to encourage and strengthen the opposition . Offensive measures_ are therefo re essential, and shou ld be initiated at the earliest possibl e moment and continued until the object is achi ejyech The -u. w ~ ^ offensive should not only be directed against the hostile—armed forc es but should also aim at the capture or arrest of the lea ders'. Yet the Army and the Royal Air Force had been forced into a largely defensive role: even against the armed forces they were restricted in their use of weapons, prisoners captured by them frequently escaped the penalties of their crimes under the civil^law, while the acknowledged leaders remained at liberty taking no pains to disgpise either their movements or their intentions. It remains to be seen what effect this had upon the Crown Forces. The Effect of a mainly Defensiv eJRole The first visible effect was upon the number of troops required. It will never be possible to guard every point of danger, and nothing dissipates strength so quickly as the frequently unproductive work of static defence. The continual flow of reinforcements to Palestine tells its own story: as fast as they arrived they were absorbed in guard duties until at last it became necessary to send out a whole additional Division. It had also an important effect on morale. Continual guard duties with little excitement and many nights out of bed, coupled with a general lack of recreational facilities, soon became irksome to the troops. The lack of opportunity of getting to grips in an open fight was very discouraging, while all the more galling was the sight of oolice held in reserve to be rushed out to the scene of an engagement while the soldier was left to perform the more hum-drum duties of the policeman. The officers too found little scope with their men tied up in guard duties, while the complicated restrictions on the use of arms and the rigorous investigation by the civil author ities of every alleged 'incident' only served to re-affirm an old sus picion that 'duty in aid of the civil power' provides nothing but pitfalls for the unwary.44816—1 36 The effect of propagand a Another element of policy which did much to encourage the rebels to continue and had also a discouraging effect upon the troops was the lack of counter-propaganda by the British authorities. ihe rebels used extensive and bombastic propaganda which received wide publicity^ was entirely believed by a credulous peasantry , and wa^ enormously exaggerated in uassing from mouth to mouth. It took two main forms. One consisted of fantastic accounts of the 'successes' of the armed bands including wild figures of the alleged casualties inflicted upon British forces. Many results of military action were nullified by reports of this type, especially as colour was often given to them by the fact that the enemy was frequently left in possession of the field when engagements took place in the late evening and vvas able to snipe columns on their way home. It did not need much imagination to translate this into a 'victory' in which British troops had been 'driven back'. The other form of propaganda comprised the disemina- tibh of the wildest stories, of British 'excesses', evidence of which was sometimes deliberately manufactured. It is only necessary to quote the Press story that British aeroplanes were dropping poisoned sweetmeats to show the length to which this type of propaganda was carried. Both forms were a constant source of annoyance to the troops who would have welcomed at least a firm denial. About the middle cf June some counter-propaganda measures were instituted at the request of the military commander, but it is doubtful whether they had much value. Mostly they consisted of the dropping of pamphlets by aeroplanes and propaganda from the Govern ment broadcasting station. In both cases the method of distribution was obviously suspect, while few villagers could read the pamphlets and the wireless reached only a small and rather more sophisticated audience. On the other hand the delicacy of the government in referring to their opponents was fastidious in the extreme. At a very early stage an order was issued that Hauranis - who formed the tougher elements in the town rioting and were mostly illegal immigrants from Syria or Trans-Jordan - were to be referred to only as 'countrymen'. Troops were definitely forbidden to speak of 'raids' on villages, the words 'rebel' or 'enemy' were strictly discouraged, the rebellion itself was tactfully called 'the strike' or simply 'disturbances', while even the punitive demolitions in the old city of Jaffa were described officially as 'town-planning'. This type of delicacy leaves the field open to the other side and, to say the least, makes the armed forces of the Crown appear some what ridiculous. There is no doubt that a systematic dissemination of accurate information and fair commentary on the situation is a valuable aid to restoring order under such conditions and a source of encourage ment to those employed upon this task. TitE MAIN LESSONS IN THE CONDUCT OF THE MIL I TARY OPE RATIONS Tc sum up, the main lessons of this chapter are as follows: (l) A conciliatory policy alone will seldom end a rebellion. Sooner or later some form of repressive measures will have to he employed, and the sooner they are employed the less will be the degree of severity required.44816—1 37 (2) Martial lav/ will usually facilitate military operations. As soon as a military commander can answer satisfactorily the five questions which have been quoted the time has come for a declara tion of martial law« (3) The immediate application of the full Effects of martial law requires detailed preparation beforehand, and complete schemes for the assumption of military control should be prepared in peace. (4) Troops can act only by force and must be enabled to pursue the offensive if results are to be achieved. Their employment on purely defensive duties is very extravagant, leads to a loss of morale and produces no concrete results. (5) Government propaganda is necessary to counter that of the opponent. It has also the effect of encouraging the government forces. 'When 171 o take a final quotation from the Royal Commission Report: on ce it is recognised 'that the Civil Police and Magis tracy cannotmarn- tain order the military should, in our opinion, be called m, nou t£ act as an additional police force, but under ma rtial law^with alljihad it i mpli es'•44816-1 38 CIIAPT3R 5 gCx,.d^iO^RS ST-g-rS THE SYSTSI'i OF COIv^^M) The Higher Comman d The system of command in Palestine was somewhat complicated. The High Commissioner, who was also nominal Commander-in-Chief, bore the ultimate responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, and there fore directed the higher policy and was the supreme co-ordinating authority. The Air Officer Commanding (Air Vice-Marshal R.E.C. Peirse, D.S.O., A.F.C.) was His Excellency’s military adviser in all matters connected with the land and air forces, and was responsible to the High Commissioner for the employment of these forces. There was nothing unusual in this system, which followed a normal colonial procedure; but practical difficulties arose at the outset of the rebellion owing to a different interpretation of the powers of the Commander-in-Chief and the Air Officer Commanding respectively in relation to command of the forces in the field. Paragraph 28 of ’ ’The King’s Regulations fo r the Army ', which is quoted in full below, appeared to define these powers precisely, and the Air Officer Commanding assumed that it was directly applicable to Palestine* Paragraph 129 (l) of ’’ The King’s Regulations for the Royal Air Force and Air Council Instructions ” is worded in almost identical language: ' The governor of a colony, protectorate or mandated territory is the single and supreme authority responsible to and representati ve of His Majesty. He is, by virtue of his commission, and the letters patent, entitled to the obedience and assistance of all military and civil officers, but although bearing the title of captain-general or commander-in-chief, and although he may be a military officer, senior in rank to the officer commanding th e forces; he^is not, except on special appointment from His Majesty, invested with the command of His Majesty’s Forces in the colon y, protectorate or mandated territory. He is not, therefore, entitled to take the immediate direction of any military opera - —or, ex cept in cases of urgent necessity, to communicat e, with subordinate military officers wi thout the con- currenc e of the officer commandin g the forces, to whom any such exceptio nal communication must be immediately notified '^ Though these instructions may have been clear enough to the officer comman mg the forces, the High Commissioner interpreted them however m a very much wider sense. ^ t/y as t * le Arny was concerned the Air Officer Commanding , . . e , e oyment of the troops, hut the responsibility for thei . nlri 't lns Poc ion and general administration lav with the General and t S e Briti:sh Tro °P s in Egypt.

British TrfSri T PS f dealt airCCt either the A *°- C - or the G ‘ 0J British xroops in Egypt according to the subject. The arrival of44816-1 39 G-eneral Dill in September did at least remove some of these difficulties, and made it possible for G-. O.C. Egypt to be relieved of his responsibili ties in Palestine. Although the Naval forces still remained independent of the G.O.C., Palestine, even this modified measure of unified control proved of great advantage. Command in the Field Five main factors affected the system of decentralising command in the field to subordinate commanders (a) Provision for the maintenance of order in the towns, and the protection of Jewish colonies and certain vulnerable points. (b) The necessity for maintaining highly mobile reserves at selected localities with the object of moving immediately on receipt of information to attack armed bands and, if possible, to forestall their intended action. (c) The necessity for ensuring the free operation of traffic by rail and road. (d) The prevention of infiltration of arms and undesirables across the frontiers. (e) The provision of a general reserve in the event of the rebellion spreading to Transjordan, or some other major commitment. The first two requirements were met by dividing the country into appropriate military areas, allotting troops to the areas, appointing area commanders and leaving them as free a hand as possible within their own boundaries. The rebellion started and ended with Palestine divided into two principal military areas - Northern and Southern - the allotment of troops to each area rising from a battalion in April to a division in September. In the meantime partition into three, four, five and six areas had been tried at different stages. _ Frequen. changes in military areas are of course inconvenient, but are difficult to avoid when re-inforcements are flowing in and new formation headquarters are arriving one by one. A glance at Appendix I will show how new unios and headquarters were continually arriving. There was in consequence a constant divergence between the tendency to allot a complete area to each rather than break up existing formations on arrival, and the desirability of mixing new units with seasoned troops who already Knew an area. Area responsibilities were so heavy that it was rarely possible to place a new formation in reserve, and the difficulty was partially met by allotting it to the quietest area and attaching to each unit for a week or two a substantial cadre of officers and N.C.O s of the unit being relieved. Sven this was not always possible and was never very satisfactory, but experience proved that re-mforcements were surprisingly quick in taking over control of a new area. !n deciding upon the number of military areas it was noticcaole that ^vision into an odd number of areas invariably led to difficulty later. bHisrc the country was divided into two or four areas subsequent sub-division or amalgamations caused little dislocation. a probably already subdivided to units, and the ideal was achieved when a reinforcing battalion could take ovor a former company area, a Brigade a battalion area, and so on. In selecting boundaries it was necessary to keep as near as possible to the existing civil district boundaries. The latter could not bo changed without serious disorganization, ^ if the military boundary did not coincide a commander would find h _.s compelled to deal with more than one District Commissioner, whose office might even be in another military area.44816-1 40 Subdivision within an area was largely a matter of personal opinion, influenced sometimes hy the particular geography. In Palestine division into sub-areas was usually the rule, m the ooa.h the exception. But whatever system was employed a wide measure of decentralisation was found to he necessary. The actions were those of small units often under the command of comparatively junior regimental officers^ and commanders had to guard against a tendency not to interfere mi oh the man on the spot. The absence of any widespread operations together with I ease of communication by wireless and car, made this more difficult than it sounds, and it was only too easy for a Brigadier to get himself _ involved in a company action which might perhaps be the only one of the day in the whole of the Brigade area. ^ Beyond this decentralisation, other essentials of a sound organization within an area were to ensure that the minimum number of troops was employed on piotective duties and I the maximum number available as striking lorcesj that cleai principles ■were laid down to cover the action oi the latter} that troops were suitably stationed to meet likely enemy moves} and khu.t sufficient trans* port was available at each post to ensure instant mobility. The organization of command to ensure free operation of road and rail communications presented some difficulties, since all areas were affected and some measure of central control was required. So far as roads were concerned Force H.Q. controlled the operation of convoys, while responsibility for their protection in transit and for the protection of the road itself devolved upon the area commanders within their own boundaries. The meeting and handing-over of convoys at area frontiers involved a certain wastage of troops and motor transport but, after trying out other methods with a view to effecting economics, this system was still found in the end to give the best results* The same plan could not be applied to the railway since protection was so intimately connected with the technical operation. The method adopted therefore was to constitute the railway system as a separate area under an independent commander whose boundaries corresponded with those of rail way property and whose headquarters were located in the railway head offi: This system had its drawbacks, and was never entirely satisfactory to other area commanders, but the fact remains that it worked satisfactorily throughout. Its principal disadvantage lay in the fact that hills overlooking the railway, from which attacks developed and snipers operated, were outside the railway area and therefore the responsibility of another area commander, who had sometimes to provide picquets while the railway area troops confined their attention to close protection of trains, stations, the track, and 'workers employed upon it. This aspect has been dealt with in further detail in Chapter 14. The problem of closing the frontiers to arms and undesirables was made especially acute by the geography of Palestine. The Syrian frontier lay in inaccessible hill country with no lateral road communica tions, while the border with Trans-Jordan was the malarious and intensely hot Jordan Valley lying far below sea level in which the employment of British troops was undesirable. The task was also one for the cavalry and mechanised infantry which the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force was best suited to provide. For this reason the Jordan Valley was at first made a separate area under the command of the senior T.J.F.F. officer in Palestine. This was found to be unsatisfactory for the reason that mobile troops ■'were often tied to static defence by the necessity of maintaining order in the towns and protecting the Jewish colonies which lay inside the area. Later the abolition of the Jordan Area resulted in the O.C., T.J.F.F. units in Palestine having to deal with two separate military area commanders, and at times even to the distrioution of a single half-squadron between two areas. It was also found tnat o^iicers Oj. re—inforcing British units did not always under stand the administration and capabilities of a purely local force. is p_ coable tnat the services, of local forees 'will usually be employ®^ to the best advantage when they are given an independent role under thei r own commander, directly responsible to Force H.Q. and without any area commitments*44816-1 41 The final requirement, the prevision of a general reserve, was at first met by retaining one highly-mobile unit among the H.Q. troops.^ This role was filled for the most part by the 2nd Bn., The Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, carried in the Ford V 8 trucks of the R»A. x'. Lifting Company, and also at times by the 3th Hussars. But die^major commitment of the reserve - revolt in Trans-Jordan - never materialised, and it was in fact employed mostly to reinforce the military areas in Palestine. On such occasions it was necessary to place it temporarily under the area commander, with the result that the unit was constantly changing command. The arrival of the Emergency Force from England an September made it possible to allot sufficient troops to areas oo provide each with an adequate local reserve, and no infantry or cavalry units were any longer retained as H.Q. troops. The Trans-Jordan commit ment was met by earmarking a Brigade of the Southern /irea x or this possible task. This enabled the Area Commander to employ the Brigade on suitable tasks which did not involve a wide dispersion, and at the same time gave the Brigade itself a chance to carry out its reconnais sances and make necessary preparations. This is probably e me of providing for a general reserve under similar conditions, though m Palestine it was never actually put to the ultimate test. THE STAFF Force Headquarters At the besannincr of the rebellion the Air Officer Commanding exercised command tM a staff of some It R.A.F. officers divided among branches dealing with 'Operations', 'Irio 'lligence 3 rganiza ion and Training', 'Signals', 'Personnel', 'Stores', and 'Engineering . In addition there was a civilian staff for Works and Buildings and for cipher duties. Air H.Q. was accommodated in a_ former hotel building in Jerusalem where it had been installed some five years earlier. The Officer Commanding British Troops in Palestine (Colonel J.F. Evetts, M.C. ) had his Headquarters in the same building as Air h.Q. It was however organized quite independently as a fomation .^. immediately suboniinate to Air H.Q., and it was the custom for the two to correspond by letters and signal messages m the normal manner. It wL not i economical method and inevitably resulted in a certain amount of duplication and unnecessary staff work. It had prooably arisen irom the fact that no commander of the British Troops m Palestine had been atraointed prior to 1932, and command had been exercised, without a staff officer ' by the senior Lieutenant-Colonel of the two infantry battalions. 1936 the staff of the O.C. British Troops consisted of a Brigade Major and an acting Staff Captain, who was a regimental officer of ah. battalion stationed in Jerusalem. Such were the staff arrangements which continued until the 7th. June when they became no longer workable. Their effect was to tnrou upon’th^ smeller staff an overwhelming share of the work involved. In the stive of 'duties in aid of the civil power' in its true sense it is inevitable that most of the work will fall to troops rather than to aircraft and until the armed bands started to appear m June the latter could do Tittle more than reconnaissance. Thus to the Amoy H.Q. fell most of the work of the first two months, and its work was further most oi xne ne _.,„ sitv ^der the existing system of passing on all information^to^the^uperior formation. The task was far beyond the canacity of the existing staff of two, and a hasty expansion had to be ^ J , ruy. e nee &lt; 3 . for an Intelligence Officer was at once felt.^ res °' e .uu e necessary experience was available and the battalion in JemsSem^ already short of officers, had to be called u^on to produce yet another staff officer. When reinforcements first started to44816-1 42 arrive a Movement Officer was immediately required, and it was necessary to ask Egypt for an officer with the required experience. Further help from Egypt had to be invoked in May to increase the staff of H.Q. British Troops, which by June had risen to two Brigade Majors, two Staff Captains, two Intelligence Officers, a Movement Officer (at Haifa) and a Signals Officer. The latter also commanded the R. Signals detachment which had been sent from Egypt to provide despatch riders, telephone exchange operators and linemen. Even this increase was barely enough. Prom the morning nf the 19th. April work at the Army Headquarters had continued without a break day and night; officers had to be present continuously, and yet reliefs were complicated by shortage of transport (two cars) and the fact that no mess or quarters were available near at hand. Frequent visits to local commanders and troops in the field were essential, and the constant arrival of reinforcements increased the rj res sure of work. Each new unit was met at the frontier by a staff officer to convey necessary operational instructions and information, while another supervised the administrative preparations for its reception v/ithout any advance party and no R.A.O.C. organization beyond a single Staff-Serjeant. Seven weeks under these conditions was a serious strain on the Commander and his six staff officers and small body of clerks available. By this time the garrison had risen to five battalions of infantry, in addition to artillery, engineer, signal, tank and R.A.S.C. units, and was rapidly becoming more than even a doubled Brigade H.Q. staff could deal with adequately. The imminent arrival of the 15th. Infantry Brigade H.Q. and three more battalions early in June made complete reorganization imperative and necessitated the creation of something approaching a Divisional Headquarters. The presence of eight battalions obviously suggested organization into two Brigades, so that one additional Brigade H.Q. had to be created as well as a Divisional H.Q. The solution adopted was to pool the resources of Air H.Q. and H.Q. British Troops to form one combined Force H.Q. staff. The immediate economies effected by this change were sufficient to provide the commander of the newly-formed Brigade with a full staff of officers and a fair number of clerics. The Combined Staff worked extremely well, and resulted at once in a better division of duties and the consequent relief of the strain on the Army staff. Sheer necessity had brought it into being and the results it achieved justified the innovation. At the start it was frankly an experi ment, but very soon it was found that army and R.A.F. officers had little difficulty in learning to perform the staff duties of the other service; both learn l. a great dead from each other and the ve:.qy closest co operation resulted. Such disadvantages as the Combined Staff possessed arose from the fact that there was not a combined superior authority ^/ich which it could deal: in consequence it was necessary to keep in separate compartments things such as finance, works, services etc. which otherwise could have been combined so far.as local conditions were concerned. Since the combined Staff in Palestine was the first of its kind to be tried out under active service conditions, its composition is of interest^ and is given in full in Appendix Ill(i) together with details regarding the division of duties in Appendix Ill(ii). ^ Combined Staff lasted from the 8 th. June to the 15th. September, by which time the garrison had risen to 11 infantry battalions, 2 cavaliy regiments, and sufficient units of other arms to bring it to the approximate strength of one Division. With the arrival of the Emergency Force from England came a fully staffed Corps Headquarters on War otab 1 1 shment. Thus the strength of officers at the Army H.Q. had grown from 2 in April by the successive stages of 7 in June, 3C)' in the Combined Staff, to finally 54 in September. Che organization of the staff in Palestine in October 1936 is shown m full m Appendix IV.44816-1 45 The Corps H.Q. establishment proved to be short of personnel in more than one direction: no provision was made for a Central Registry and the clerical staff was totally insufficient for conducting operations on the basis of peace-time accounting. As regards the former, one officer clerk and sufficient other rank clerks to staff a central registry were immediately required, and help from Egypt had. to be invoked to procure them. Reference is made later on to the difficulties of continu ing peace accounting on active service: if this is to be done a Corps H.Q. needs to be augmented with staffs to deal with such matters as contracts, cost accounting and elaborate supply accounts, since the War Establishment is sufficient only to handle such things on a war time footing. This applies especially to R.A.P.C. Staff, who were incidentally in dire need of typewriters to do their monthly pay accounts and were not consoled when the first instalment of baggage proved to be six out-size ice chests l In spite of this the H.Q. brought with it a number of advisers and experts, and one consequence of their arrival was a veiy noticeable increase in paper-work throughout the whole garrison. Previously force of circumstances had kept this to a minimum without, it must be confessed, any apparent loss of efficiency. British Army staffs are appreciably larger than those of some other European armies: it is inevitable that the larger the staff the greater will be the paper-work inflicted upon the troops in the field, and it is worthy of consideration whether efficiency increases enough to provide justifica tion. Much of the work may be traced to attempts to secure economy, but sometimes it may be questionable whether in the end the method employed does not defeat its own object. Staffs of Lower Formations With the exception of the Brigade H.Q. already referred to, most of the lower formations arrived in Palestine with their H.Q. staffs complete. Sven so a certain amount of improvisation became necessary: staffs had to be found for formations such as Base Area, L. of C. Area etc., while casualties had to be replaced locally as a rule. The difficulty of finding suitable officers to fill these posts was very marked, and it was fortunate that a supply was^close at hand in Egypt. In the type of operations then in progress, which often involved the^ widest dispersion of small detachments, there were seldom enough regi mental officers to go round and to withdraw any more for staff duties would have handicapped seriously most of the battalions. Particular difficulty was experienced in finding trained Intelligence Officers, and even those who held mobilization appointments in the Emergency Force often had had little practical experience of intelligence work. It was found that attendance at a course of instruction alone is not sufficient to qualify an officer for intelligence duties at a Brigade H.Q. or higher without practical experience at exercises and manoeuvres. A deficiency in other ranks was experienced in some Headquarters Establishments, and resulted in a further drain upon the fighting This ao-ain was a serious thing for most units: many were already far below their proper establishment, some had left large rear parties at their previous stations, and as a rule the paper strength of a unit was no real indication of its effective strength in the field where man power rather than fire-power was invariably_required. To quote instances, it was found necessary to implement a Divisional Headquarters with the following:- 2 N.C.O’s and 4 typists for 'G-' and 'AQ' Staff. Clerks for D.A.P.M. and Camp Commandant - also typewriters and office equipment. An N.C.O. to understudy and assist the C.Q.M.S. A caterer and cook for the Serjeants’ Mess.44816-1 44 In addition the use of 'Batmen-drivers' was found to be quite impracticable. It was inevitable that either tn oixi ox the car was neglected, and not unnaturally it was more often the latter, so that no real economy was likely to be effected. As with Corps d.Q. additional personnel were required to continue peace accounting on active service. In Palestine moves of headquarters were less frequent than in normal warfare. Force H.Q. had one complete move, and also on one occasion established an operational hea.dqua.rters for three days; Divisional H.Q's. did not move, and there were few moves of Brigade H.Q's. In the larger headquarters a move involved serious dislocation of the signals system, since wireless and telephone installations were mostly of a permanent or semi-permanent nature and the move had to be made without interruption of communications. It was usually necessary to site a headquarters near a main civil telephone and telegraph route. A final lesson in the staff work of all branches was the necessity of constantly looking ahead in the matter of re-inforcements. They usually arrived with very short notice under conditions which required the strictest secrecy. The staff had to keep constantly before it the questions: 'What re-inforcements will be required next?' 'How v/ill they be employed, commanded, accommodated and supplied?'4481S-1 45 CHAPTER 6 INTELLIGENCE AND INTERCONI/iUNICATION TI-~E COLLECTION ON INFORI.iATIQN The System There were three organizations for the collection of information: Force H.Q. 'I' Branch which covered both Palestine and Trans-Jordan, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Palestine Police which covered Palestine alone, and the 'I” Section of the Arab Legion which covered onlg Trans-Jordan. Each had its independent organizations for collecting information and for maintaining liaison with the other two. The Special Service Officers Apart from that supplied in the normal way through the Intelligence Officers of lower formations, the bulk of military information at Force H.Q. came from the R.A.F. Special Service Officers. In normal times S.S.O's were stationed in Palestine at Jerusalem and Haifa and in Trans- Jordan at Amman and Ma’an, but as the rebellion developed others were appointed to Jaffa, Nablus, Nazareth and the Jordan Valley. Their duties ’were to procure information of a military, political and topo graphical nature, and to keep in touch with feeling in the country by touring their districts. Though directly under the orders of Force H.Q. they maintained close liaison 'with local military commanders, the District; Administration and the police. They employed their own agents for the collection of information. The S.S.O. system, superimposed upon the normal army intelligence system, was very successful and in no way caused either duplication or interference with each other. The S.S.O. was usually an Arabic-speak ing officer with special local knowledge, he alone was authorised to employ agents, and he reached many sources inaccessible to the array intelligence officer. The latter on the other hand collected and collated the vast amount of varied information obtained by the fighting troops, and relieved the S.S.O. of much oi the routine work, particular ly that concerned with topographical information. S.S.O’s had their own wireless cars and reported direct to Force H.Q*, so that the value of their information was greatly enhanced Dy the speed with which it arrived. As officers of Force H.Q. they had direct access to jLocal commanders, and this personal contact was a valuable asset to the latter. In future operations of the some nature it is probable that some similar intelligence system will be found a necessary addition to tne normal army one. Police Intelligenc e The special difficulties of the police have already been explained, and they were particularly apparent in the collection of information. In addition it must be confessed that there was a certain lack of colla boration and a lack of confidence in each other between the Police C.I.D. and the Force Intelligence Service. It was perhaps inevitable, in view of the attitude of the Arab section of the police and the peculiar cir cumstances existing in consequence, that there was insufiicient consul tation or personal liaison between the two organizations working on exactly parallel lines. Police reports of an urgent nature were often late in reaching military sources, and there was a noticeable inclino.- tion on the part of Police officers to over-estimate both the authenti city and the value of information supplied. After one or two experi ences of this kind new arrivals in Palestine were apt to regard all police information with a certain amount of suspicion*44816-1 46 Agents There was unavoidably a certain amount of competition between the S.S a 0’s and the Police for the services of good agents, ana for that reason alone it was essential that the army intelligence officer should not be brought into the field as a third competitor. The life of an informer in Palestine was an extremely dangerous one, and agents needed and deserved adequate payment; but it was also very necessary that^ inexperienced personnel without good local knowledge should noo spoil the market by paying for unimportant information. ^ payment in strict proportion to results was found to be the only satisfactory method. Widespread intimidation added to the difficulties of the agent's work, and the problem of getting his information back in time for it to be acted upon was a formidable one, so that much good informauion from the more remote hill districts was sometimes not only too late to be used but might even be misleading., A very good kno.vledge of the habits and capabilities of the armed bands was required if this cor.-, of infor* Ph mation was to be interpreted to the best advantage, and the S.S.O. was invariably best qualified to apply it. Inhabi ta nt s Sympathy with the rebels, intensified by universal intimidation, made it virtually impossible to obtain from Arab inhabitants or prisoners any useful information regarding the enemy. On the other hand they were usually quite ready to give information of a topographical nature. This was frequently volunteered and was usually correct, and anyone with even a smattering of Arabic could as a rule obtain a certain amount of this sort of intelligence. Jewish inhabitants were generally ready with a mass of information, little of which was ever of any value, often lurid tales were told with the principal object of keeping troops in the vicinity. Responsible Jewish sources were however very well informed on the whole. Aircraft The broken nature of the country and the dispersion and concealment normally adopted by the enemy made it difficult to locate them either from the air or the ground, and this was especially true of the olive grove districts in the hills. Aircraft were forced in consequence to fly very lov/ when reconnoitring. More difficult still was to distin guish between hamless and hostile Arabs, since armed bands seldom moved in formed bodies by day. The best indication was of course small arms fire from the ground, which could usually be heard when directed at the aircraft. But the Arabs learnt this after a while, and later tended to with-hold their fire until they had been located. Air photographs were used extensively and proved of great value. In the absence of hostile anti-aircraft artillery it was possible to produce mosaics to a wide extent. Where information regarding roads and tracks was required it was found that an oblique will often give the derails just as well as a vertical and will cover more ground. Air reconnaissance was also very useful for locating road-blocks and serious damage to bridges, railways and pipe-lines; while the value of personal air reconnaissance by army officers - especially prior to detailed ground reconnaissance — was once again very clearly demonstrated.Types of Ground encountered in Palestine— Page A Photograph No. 3 ne nld i' ded 1 t s to om Excellent going—The Vale of Jezreel. bits dp- P hotograph No. 4 as oners were with of Too ops went r e to n- oved rms the d to Excellent going—The Plain of Sharon.

Here the enemy had of course an immense natural advantage over the troops; and lack of knowledge of the country sometimes tied troops so 'badly that inability to manoeuvre only too often resulted in the enemy escaping, es£&gt;ecially when an action took place in failing light. The first essential in this direction was the continual collection - especially in peace - of adl sorts of topographical information and, even more important, the collation of this information in readily accessible form. The latter is by no means an easy task: long detailed written reports are tiresome for units to compile and become increasingly difficult to understand. Perhaps the best plan is for formations to issue skeleton enlargements on, say, a scale of 1:10,000 on which infor mation can be recorded. It was found that police files contained good information regarding villages, but little regarding tracks and water supplies. It ’was essential therefore for all units on arrival to start at once to make a thorough ground reconnaissance of the whole of the area in their vicinity. Too often this was postponed until an impending operation demanded information on a specific point, when reconnaissance was too hasty and was likely to endanger secrecy. '.There speed ’was essential the enployment of light tanks on ground reconnaissance was sometimes found to be justified. It was necessary for troops occupying defended posts to be thoroughly conversant with all ground within at least two miles of the posts with a vieva to carrying out day and night operations against snipers. In picquets telescopes proved most valuable for locating snipers and for watching movements in and out of villages. An a-ddition of three telescopes to the six provided for the battalion signals would have been a great asset, v/hile one pair of binoculars was really required in every section. Later in the year when the rains started, it was found that a constant supply of information regarding the day-to-day condition of tracks was necessary for the safe movement of M.T. A useful practice in some formations was the daily reporting by units of the state of tracks traversed in the previous twenty-four hours. Beiore crossing new ground in hill districts M.T. units required information^not only as to width, surface and gradients, but particularly as to turning points and radius of comers. La.ck of knowledge in this la.st respect some times resulted in vehicles being unable to negotiate a difficult bend, with the consequence that infantry had to debus in the wrong place losing time and perhaps secrecy.

THE BISTPJBUT10N OF IhPOPHATION Narratives, Summaries a nd Stat istics It was not easy to strike the happy medium between she dissemination, by means of narratives etc., of enough information to keep units well- informed, and the danger of over-burdening the Intelligence organisation with the distribution of information to the exclusion of its collection. Units in the field, often out of practical reach of the daily press, naturally liked to know what was going on in the country in general;44816-1 48 'but they did not v/ant too much to read, far less too much to write, in the shape of reports and returns. For this reason it was necessary to keep under constant review the issue of routine intelligence documents, Their value depended chiefly on the speed with which they could be distributed, and this was usually the deciding iactor as to whether the issue of a particular document should be continued. In Palestine it was usual for all headquarters, from Force H.Q. to battalion H.Q., to issue a daily narrative of events. These were usually distributed during the afternoon and contained information received up to 0800 hrs. In addition Force H.Q. and some lower head quarters, produced a weekly Intelligence Summary which included political information, forecasts of likely developments, press extracts etc., as well as a resume of the operations of the past v/eek and also 'Special points of military interest'. Farce H.Q. also issued at regular inter vals statistical detail on such subjects as ammunition expended, casual ties to both sides, arms captured, numbers of vehicles convoyed, and many others. All of this produced a mass of data for record purposes, but undoubtedly at times resulted in the expenditure of more energy than perhaps was justified by the immediate requirements. As a consequence of these experiences it is thought that in future the procedure listed below should suffice to reconcile too much paper-work with too little exchange of information. In Units and R.A.F. Stations: One daily intelligence report in message form is essential, covering the previous twenty-four hours. In addition a written summary is required twice a week. In Brigade s: One daily report in message form is necessary. This will usually be despatched first thing in the morning and compiled from unit reports which have arrived during the night. It should be followed by a daily written narrative, prepared during the morning and despatched in the afternoon. '| ■ In Divisions: Corps will of course require a daily narrative from Divisions, but whether this should also be sent to Brigades will depend upon communications. If a Corps daily narrative can be distributed tnroughout the area of operations in one day, then it will probably be sufficient for Divisions to issue only a v/eekly summary. Where this is not possible, Divisions should distribute a narrative daily to Brigades and to each other. Force H. Q. A weekly intelligence summary will invariably be required, and should be issued in sufficient quantity to allow of distribution down to unit and R.A.F. Station headquarters. If Divisions issue daily narratives it is probably unnecessary for Force H.Q. to do so ve Hj and the narratives can be incorporated in a weekly or bi-weekly summary. If Divisions do not issue daily narratives, then Force H.Q. should do so. So So far as statistics are concerned there was a tendency to throw unneceooary work on intelligence officers by demanding a higher degree of accuracy than was required and sometimes by asking them for informa tion which was already available elsewhere. Statistics are undoubtedly useful for staff officers^and may be of general interest to the troops, but as a rule only approximate figures are wanted for this purpose. In any case many can be extracted from the normal administrative returns,44816-1 49 rendered in accordance with Appendix III of Field Service Regulations, and intelligence officers should not be bothered with then. ’iThere special returns are required, such as lists of arms captured, vehicles convoyed etc. , they should not be asked for separately, but should be included in the daily narratives. PRESS CORRESPONDENTS Happenings in Palestine were increasing in news value just about the time that the war in Abyssinia was losing interest, with a result that an impressive number of war correspondents found their way there. Had it been possible to give them the recognised facilities of corres pondents in the field, there is no doubt that they would have proved most valuable allies; but unfortunately it was not until very late in the rebellion that the Administration agreed to the establishment of a military press bureau. Before that, on orders from the nigh Commissioner, direct communication between the Forces and the Press had been foroidden, and the only official source of information available to correspondents was the Government Press Office which issued a Daily Communique. The Official Communique was naturally a rather bare statement of facts, which was not sufficient for the Press and did not always make full use of the opportunities available. Since journalists obviously have to send in a continual flow of colourful reports to their papers, if they are cut off from the best sources of legitimate military news they will inevitably be forced to resort to illegitimate means to obtain it; and this is what happened in Palestine. The results were distasteful to the good correspondent, bad for the discipline of the forces, and gave prominence to inaccurate and sometimes unfortunate news. V/hen the ban was lilted eventually it was found that the press correspondents, once freed of tiresome restric tions and given an ample supply of authentic news, responded most loyally and gave readily much valuable help. The value of a 'good press' in a rebellion is obviously very great, and the best way to obtain it is to place journalists on the same foot ing as war correspondents in the field and give them an ample supply of accurate military information. To do this it will often be advisable for interviews to be given by senior officers of the 'Operations' branch - and occasionally by Commanders - at which a full and frank explana ion of the military situation can be given and questions answered. ^ I not found to be sufficient to restrict correspondents to interviews with press officers of 'I” Branch. MAPS mhe map in general use in April 1936 was the War Office 1:250,000 Lambert Grid series, but the Palestine Government Survey Department was on the point of completing a new 1:100,000 topographical map. ne publication of this series was specially accelerated until new p*p® * became available at the rate of about one a month, so that approximately half the country had been covered by the time the rebellion ended. In all 23,000 locally produced maps were issued to His Majesty s forces between April and November. The War Office map had many defects. It was by no means up to date and was often sadly inaccurate, place names were spelt ^ differently to the spelling in common use in Palestine, and the Jewish colonies were not shown. The scale was too small for normal tactical44816-1 50 use, and a plethora of place names made it difficult to read. employed was also different to that of the Palestine Survey maps which resulted in complications when it was used in conjunction with the 1:100,000, a particular disadvantage when troops were co-operating with aircraft. By the end of the year it was possible to replace it by a Palestine Survey map of the same scale, produced in a single sheet, well up to date and with the same grid as the 1:100,000. The local 1:100,000 map was a good one and the only one of real use when moving cross-country but, being produced in small sheets covering a width of little more than 20 miles, it had the disadvantage of being inconvenient for use in aircraft and cars. This was however overcome by local purchase of an excellent motor map published by the Palestine Government, of which a new edition was available. The scale of the motor map was 1:500,000, which was small enough to cover the whole of Palestine (less part of the southern desert region) and neighbouring portions of Syria and Trans-Jordan in one folded sheet. It included street plans of the three main towns, and showed landing grounds and civil administrative boundaries. The standard of the various roads and tracks was clearly shown, and the map was contoured and coloured at intervals of 300 metres. Bor every purpose except minor tactics it fulfilled a much-felt want, and was in great demand for issue to M.T, drivers who had little use for the rather scarce 1:100,000 map. The chief drawback of the motor map was its cost (l/- per copy) but its value to re~infarcing units amply justified the expenditure. Similar local motor maps are usually available nowadays in most countries and their value in an emergency may at times be overlooked, but it will often be found that they are just what is required by the mass of M.T. drivers who now form so large a part of the Army. A third type of map, prepared by Air H.Q. and printed at the Palestine Survey Office, was mainly diagramatic and contained in most convenient form a wealth of military information. The scale was 1.150,000 - which may have been on the large side, as it necessitated three sheets « and it showed no topographical information except towns, villages and the main communications. On the other hand it included every Arao village and Jewish settlement correctly named, and showed the system of grouping Jewish colonies for defence purposes. Civil, police an military area boundaries were given in colour: landing grounds, Wa j railways, and roads classified according to condition were also included in the detail. Finally it gave the locatio: o ^ every police station and post (showing whether wireless or telephone was available), of telephone exchanges, switching exchanges and test o ices, an the peace stations of the normal garrison. A map of this ype wao oun to be most valuable: it is easy to print locally and can be prepared and kept up to date at a Command H.Q. without skilled , I ^ s value to re-inforcing units in 1936 well repaid the trouble that had been taken in its preparation. wac , p n A? 63 ?' 1 ^ : , =L .

SECURITY The Problem of preventing information reaching the enemy In the absence of Martial Lav/- this problem presented the* very greatest difficulty, and it is not unfair to say that the failure to impose Martial Law resulted in needless casualties to troops owing to leakage of information. Failing Martial Law, the following were found to be useful rules for obtaining a measure of secrecy (a) Vi/herever possible plan and execute an operation in the same 24 hours. (b) Where the civil authorities and police have to be informed regarding intending operations, inform them last of all. (c) Tell outside helpers, such as interpreters and police guides, nothing beyond the time and place of rendezvous until the operation has actually started. (d) Never refer to an impending operation over the telephone, even in what you may imagine are well disguised terms. (e) Remember that every movement of your M.T. is going to be reported to the enemy. Causes of Leakage There was nothing new in the way in which information regarding plans reached the enemy: it was only intensified in Palestine by the necessity for telling everything to three separate organisations e troops, the police, and the civil authorities - and the fact that the offices of the latter two contained a preponderance of Arabs. Care lessness was usually the cause, and from this the forces themselves cannot be excused. Unguarded telephone conversations, discussion ot operations in public places, and carelessness in handling secret ^ocu- ments in offices all helped to contribute. The local labour of t -e N.A.A.F.I. was a particular danger. The Manager was often warne Y units of impending moves in order either to cancel orders a re a y p a or to obtain other goods, and the news would leak out through emp oy . The state of semi-war-semi-peace in which units worked made this danger greater than it would normally be under war conditions, and ^ ^ s ° ~ times necessary for units to be reminded that casual ieo Co.us y of secrecy are a poor exchange for good canteen arrangements or saving of money. One of the special tasks of unit in ^ e lgenw -U • should be to ensure that forthcoming operations are not discussed m Institutes. Information regarding the movement of troops was ^ transmitted by inhabitants, who watched camps and roads and sent their messages by means of lights in houses, bonfires, and ^ke ^©aals Martial Law the only legal action which could be taken to combat th^ extensive enemy signal organization was to arres an ^ ^ -nl ainlv very police any person caught in flagrante delicto. Ln although difficult to do, and mere difficult still to prove afterwards , a!though e no one abroad by night in Palestine in 1936 could have faile44816-1 52 obvious signalling in progress. Had it been possible to open fire on all signal lights, some innocent people might have been killed, but equally the lives of some British soldiers might have been saved.- Ruses Troop movements were nearly always by K.T. and it was usually impossible to hide them from the all-seeing eye of the enemy intellig ence service. The next best thing therefore was to try and deceive it. Many expedients were tried, but nearly all failed - however well executed because of a leakage of plans almost at the source* Ruses tried included the spreading of false news, dropping troops quietly from moving vehicles at night, the use of 'Q 11 buses containing troops disguised as Jewish passengers or workmen, and the adoption of circuitous routes by M.T. columns. The latter sometimes achieved a certain amount of success and where M.T. movements are usually reported to the enemy perhaps the ’ best expedient is to confuse him by the simultaneous movement of several columns in different directions. The failure of various ruses in connection with Operation 'X' is described in a later chapter containing an account of that operation. The main lesson which emerges is that the enemy was so well-informed that he was extremely difficult to bluff, and in a mainly hostile country this will probably always be the case. MISCELLANEOUS POINTS The presence in any unit of an officer with even a smattering of Arabic proved a great asset, but it was most marked how very few there were. ^s a rule there will always be a number of regimental officers and even a few other ranks who are prepared to make a superficial study o e anguage of the country in which they are stationed, especially il some small encouragement is offered in the shape of a refund of the ^ 4 - A incurred in return for passing a simple colloquial examination. prepared to go to the far greater trouble and expense of . iln ^ .. e ^ ri en ^ language well enough to secure an interpretership. ^ r ^ S 0 ®^P e niences in Palestine in 1936, approval has since been a J m : ,, award for colloquial Arabic, and there is every c^t thls . encour agement will justify many times over the small convertp ^ -P 1 ? ucin &amp; a ^air supply of military personnel who can converse m simple language with local inhabitants.

They were generally unsatisfactory, and it was extremely dangerous to rely upon them alone. In some cases local police sent to guide troops to particular villages led columns astray owing to ignorance of tracks in their own areas. Dogs The Palestine Police made extensive use of two South African trained dogs to trail criminals, and they met with an uncanny degree of success. Out of the i72 cases in which they were tried in 1936, they were success ful in 87. Two extra dogs arrived in September, and more still were needed, but nevertheless by using M.T. and sometimes aircraft two dogs succeeded somehow in covering most of the country. Both dogs and dog-masters need long and specialised training and are difficult to replace: for this reason they require most careful protection when at work. In a country where police dogs are available it is important that troops should be taught not to disturb tracks and axticles found, such as empty cartridge cases etc., if dogs are to be used there later. The results achieved will usually be found to be proportionate to the speed with which the dogs can be laid on. CONCLUSION To sum up, the principal intelligence lessons were:- (a) The need for closer co-operation between the military and police intelligence systems. (b) The special importance of a regular supply of aetailed topographical information. (c) Careful control of the paper-work involved in collecting and distributing intelligence. (d) The value of the press correspondent under conditions of rebellion when given a generous supply of accurate military news and allowed access to senior staff officers and commanders. (e) The need for two different types of maps. (f) The great value to the rebels of a sympathetic population who will both -prevent information from reaching the Government forces and at the' same time keep the enemy very fully informed of troop movements and even plans.44816-1 54 CHAPTER 7 INTERCOMIURIGATI ON THE SYSTEM PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL Off TIiS EJ.’ERGENCY FOP Hh^ At the outbreak of the rebellion the only military system of intercommunication was by Yl/T over a network of stations which had been organised by the Royal Air Force. These were of three kinds-- ( a ) Permanent R.A.F. Stations for point-to-poi nt work in paW. and Transjordan ' JS They were sited at Jerusalem, Ramleh, Haifa and Gaza, and were equipped with T.19B Transmitters. In addition to internal communication they worked also to Cairo and neighbouring countries The set at Haifa could be made mobile, and was able to work to ' local aircraft when required. Gaza was operated by Imperial Airways, although it was a R.A.F. station, but the other three were manned by R.A.F. personnel. ( b ) Transjordan Frontier Force Stations Fhere were Wo of these in Palestine - at Jisr Majami and Rosh Pinna. The sets were type T.21C and the operators local other ranks of the T.J.F.F. Both sets could be made mobile and could wo’ to local aircraft. ( c ) Palestine Police Stations The RaiestinePoUce operated eight stations equipped with C.W. fe matters.

(b) The civil telephone system stiffened by personnel of the Royal Corps of Signals. (c) A small R.Corps of Signals Despatch Rider Letter Service. In addition a courier service was run in connection with the daily M.T. convoys. Wireless The W/T system was strained to the utmost; but nevertheless it was successful throughout in maintaining a very high standard of communication, of which it remained the only safe and reliable means. Increases in the garrison, constant interruption of land lines, and the extensive use of Rodex vehicles resulted in W/T traffic reaching enormous proportions. The two main stations alone handled over 200,000 messages in six months, comprising nearly 4,000,000 groups, but in spite of it there were never any serious delays. Apart from the very high standard of efficiency of personnel, this was undoubtedly due to a great extent to the RJV.F. system of control by areas in contrast to the army method of control by the normal chain of command, since any R.A.F. set could communicate direct with any other set in the country. A somewhat excessive use of cipher and a tendency to employ too many priority prefixes were sometimes the cause of delays. This was especially true of routine aircraft movement signals which were very numerous and were all prefixed ' IMPORTANT 1 ’• Later it became necessary to reduce these, and it is doubtful whether normal pracbices designed for safety purposes in peace can be continued on active service without prejudicing the efficient working of the signal service • The normal lag between times of origin and times oi receipt of messages inside the command during the period when tratfic was at its peak was:- ”EMERGENCY” Messages Under 5 minutes 'IMMEDIATE” ' About 20 ” 'IMPORTANT” ” ' 30 ” Unprefixed ' H 80 Signal officers experienced much difficulty in keeping up the y//i watches~required of them. This was usually due to thoughtlessness on the part of commanders and staffs who expected too often continuous watch” at small stations when tactical conditions did not demand it. It was found that eight hours a day was the maximum watch an opera or could be expected to keep up over lengthy periods* It wo , a y' e been useful if a few battalion signallers had been trained to take a watch on a W/T set, so that they could supplement the two wireless operators on occasions when continuous watch was require • e ,, of W/T sets at headquarters was most important and was not always fully recognised by staff officers. It will sometimes be necessary to weigh the relative advantages of good W/T communication ui an inconvenient HQ site and poor W/T communication in a convenient but technically unsatisfactory site.44816—1 56 It was found that the local broadcasting station (on a wave-length of 449.1 metres) sometimes caused serious interference - especially No. 1 sets. During Operation 'X', which took place within a radius of some 20 miles of the P.b.S. transmitting station at Ramallah, it was necessary to close the broadcasting station while the operation was in progress. This is a point which it may become more and more necessary to bear in mind when planning future operations. The T.21 set, being simple and reliable and of long rtinge capacity, gave excellent service, but in the later stages when wireless congestion began to be felt its restricted wave frequency band and flat tuning were found to be distinct drawbacks. Telephone The civil telephone system was subjected to intensive sabotage which resulted in serious interruption of the service. It was also quite unsafe from a point of view of secrecy, and native operators were not above suspicion of deliberate obstruction of military calls, R. Signals personnel protected loyal v/orkers, guarded installations, acted as monitors in the exchanges, supervised and helped line main tenance gangs, and at the same time learnt the system with a view to operating the entire service in the event of a strike of Ptosts and Telegraphs employees. The existence of the civil permanent lines made it unnecessary to lay military land lines, and the army linemen could concentrate on the task of keeping the civil lines open. Despatch Riders and Couriers Motor cyclist despatch riders were obviously so vulnerable to ambush on the main roads that for all practical purposes their use had to be restricted to local runs in the towns and camps. On the ,l safer' roads it was sometimes possible to run D.R*s in pairs during daylight, but otherwise the D.R.L.S. was conducted mostly by means of armed trucks. Though uneconomical, the D.R. truck had several incidental advantages: it could carry small stores and parcels beyond the capacity of a motor cycle, could transport individuals, and its move ments could often be synchronized so that it might act as escort to staff cars etc. The Courier Service with the daily M.T. convoys was at first conducted by the infantry N.C.O.s of the escorts with a view oo economising in R. Signals personnel, but it was soon found that the volume of mails necessitated a more elaborate procedure. In the end he R, Corps of Signals had to take it over, and the Courier Service was absorbed into the normal D.R.L.S. system. A daily Courier Service y passenger train between Egypt and Palestine was however conducted successiully by non-Signals personnel. THE SYSTEM AFTER TIE ARRIVAL OP THE EMERG-ENCY FORCE 5 A C ° rpS the 1st and 5th Divisional ti^al nk Sept ! mber Very soon to light the fact that both the to S the ?3 n k atl0n ^ nd the s^ipnent of these units were quite unsuited course IT. thSn ±n The reason for this of the size of faCt the Foroe was de Pl°yed - even in a country fare for which '?+ _ ° ver ' far .S rea '*' er distances than in the type of war ty no means PIPP tmits were normally intended, though they were nearly 100 ais p'; ces for a colonial rebellion. In Palestine Brigade HO mi^ht h ° ne Divisiona i Headquarters from Corps, a sars.'&amp;sE s arss * »««*.»»» ^ en 20 miles from one of its companies.44816-1 57 The line equipment of the signal units was totally inadequate for such distances and, as the civil lines were unsafe and unreliable, wireless remained of necessity the primary means of intercommunication. Yfireless The army wireless equipment consisted of No. 1 sets with a normal range of 5 miles and 'C M sets capable of up to 50 miles. The only long-range facilities were afforded by No. 3 sets lent from Egypt and operated by the Corps Signals. The capabilities of the No. 1 and 'C' sets are discussed later in Chapter 10, and it is only necessary to say here that neither had sufficient range nor mobility to meet local requirements. Furthermore they could not always work to the R.A.F., T.J.F.F. and Police sets already in the country, and it became necessary to retain the whole of the R.A.F. \l/T network even after the full com plement of R. Signals units had arrived. Where Army and R.A.F. sets could work together, difficulty v/as experienced on account of operating differences between the respective personnel. This may have been due in part to inexperience, but it v/as noteworthy that difficulties seldom arose in intercommunication between the R.A.F. and the R. Navy and it may be that R. Signals operators need more practice in inter-service work. R/T was little used, owing to its limited range and to the fact that few officers seemed to know how to use it properly and consequently found W/T quicker. Telephone It has already been explained, so far as telephones were concerned, that the chief task for the signal units was to help maintain the civil lines and be ready to take over operation of the whole system if necessary. This revealed at once a need for Permanent Line Construction Units, out neither Corps nor Divisional Signals had the necessary equipment to pro vide them nor sufficient men trained in the work. This is a state of affairs that may well occur again, and it would seem that more training in permanent line construction and maintenance might be included in the normal curriculum of R. Signals units. Under many conditions of modern warfare it may be preferable to utilize existing civil lines rather than to construct temporary military lines. It will be necessary for a clear policy in this respect to be lo.id down from the start, for on it will .depend the proportion of permanent line personnel to accompany the Force. So far as imperial policing is concerned it might be possible to decide this in peace to meet various likely contingencies, and in such cases a special sca.le of reserve equipment to meet the local requirements could be held in this country. 7/here use is made of the civil system the closest co operation between Posts and Telegraphs officials and the Royal Corps of Signals is of course essential, and this is prooaoly best obtained by appointing a Signals Liaison Officer in each Post Office district to v/ork with the civil engineer in charge. In Palestine it was found that there were too few officers with practical Post Oifice experience to fill these posts. VISUAL SIGNALLING Visual signalling by means of flag, lamp, heliograph^and Verey light was used extensively and proved of exceptional value. Pioquets found it particularly useful and it was sane times the sole means of communication*44816-*1 58 in places where land lines were subject to continual saootage and where ground was too difficult for the transport of v/lieless sets. Similar],, in offensive operations, once the troops had left routes passable to M.T• they were dependent upon visual for coninunicaoion oack to the wireless sets which linked them with their cwn headquarters and with co-operating aircraft. The comparative lightness of v/T equipnent rr.ai it eminently suitable for this purpose. Infantry rrigade Signal Sectb experienced a shortage of visual apparatus, and it would have been most useful had a pool of 12 heliographs and 12 lamps oeen held by Divisional Signals at Divisional HQ for distribution to Brigade sections as requbf Training in visual signalling was not generally found to be up to the standard required for the work in hand. In the Infantry Brigade Signal Sections pressure of W/T work had in some cases resulted in a serious fall in the quality of the visual work, particularly in regard to station discipline, and it seems possible that V/T training in the Brigade sections had been reduced too much. In Battalions there was a tendency to lean too much upon the W/T resources of the Brigade, where better use might have been made of their own V/T facilities. For this type of warfare it would be useful to include in routine training the employment of semaphore communication be'tween sections and platoon head, quarters, A simple 'battle code', designed for speed and not for secrecy, was employed by some battalions and resulted in an appreciable quickening up of V/T within the units. Verey Lights Light signals were used on a much wider scale than usual, and for certain kinds of v/ork were the only satisfactory means of communication, They featured prominently in the daily routine work of convoy escorts and railway troops, while all troops in contact with the enemy employed Verey lights to convey simple messages and warnings — particularly to airci . Light signals also formed the principal means of comniunioa- tion of the Supernumerary Police, whose training had necessarily to be too short to include any other form of signalling. 1 he or awing up of a code of light signals was found to be no easy ^ as T? an&lt; ^ ru l es emerged which experience showed must govern their a .P.'P- L - J -Gata. o n« ^ The first rule was that the code must be absolutely uni- Ve ! S ^ * . was^not so at first in Palestine where railway and police as military and R,A.F, commanders, had devised ,-10 signals to meet their individual requirements, and it was not easy c n nn 0 e rese later.

SECURITY OF SIGNAL MESSAGES Telegrams and telephone messages Mention has already been made of the danger of the leakage of important information through Arab employees of the Posts and Telegraphs Department. Since the resources of any Force Signals are seldom likely to be sufficient for the complete replacement of native operators, this is liable to remain a danger in all similar circumstances. Military control under Martial Law might minimise the risks, but they cannot be eradicated altogether unless a very large staff is available. Certain palliatives can however be applied, and the following were adopted in Palestine The installation of 'monitors' in civil exchanges.44816-^1 60 The use of Fullerphones and Teleprinters . The extensive use of wireless as an alternative means of communicat' The monitors were operators of the R. Signals and their ■nresence f the exchanges probably made the interception of military messages more difficult, though it must be admitted that they never succeeded in brW ing any culprits to book, and this is certainly a difficult thing to do' The minitor system was also useful as a means of familiarizing military' operators with the civil installations, while at the same time it afford some protection to the exchanges and loyal workers, Fullerphones and Teleprinters were not widely used and suffered fro some drawbacks. The Fullerphone was not easy to work in conjunction wit a highly pliantomed civil telegraph system: to be satisfactory it require metallic lines, and the civil authorities had difficulty in providing sue: circuits. There was a further complication in connection with the handling of messages in signal offices, since messages sent in clear by Fullerphone might have to be enciphered for re-transmission by ordinary line. There was thus the risk of clear and cipher messages meeting in the signal office, and strict supervision was necessary to prevent this, The Teleprinter, although practically non-susceptible to interception also suffered from this latter disadvantage, and furthermore was too * cumbersome and expensive for employment on any but the main trunk lines, It was used chiefly for the transmission between Corps and Div. HQ of lengthy documents such as Rail Movement Orders and Intelligence Summaries, most of which were sent during the night. Though the Fullerphone and Teleprinter did offep a certain degree of security xor telegrams, the telephone always remained the greatest danger. Apart from deliberate interception, the system was subject to extensive inauction from which even n 10 x 00 ^’ lines were by no means immune. It was necessary to limit the use of telephones to occasions when it '..as absolutely certain that an unofficial listener could not make use of the information gained in time to do any harm. The result of thi vao to divert the greater bulk of military traffic to the wireless system, which remained throughout the only reliable means of transmitting secret messages.

It would seem a pity that a greater degree of standardization in the signal procedures of the three services has not yet been achieved. In Palestine the difficulties caused by the variations were most noticeable • Ciphers Until September the ciphers used for internal communication were the Inter-Service Cipher and a local inter-service code, Reinforcements from Egypt sometimes arrived with copies of the Egypt Cipher as well. The Emergency Force from England brought in addition a new Palestine Cipher. As a consequence of all this, units and formations found themselves saddled with an embarrassing number of ciphers to look after and a few facilities for their safe custody - at times Brigade Head quarters held no less than five different ciphers. This was eased later by withdrawing the Army and Egypt Ciphers, and the original inter-service code might well have been replaced altogether by the Palestine Cipher except for certain local reasons which made it con venient to retain both. Even this reduction did not satisfy many officers, who would like to have seen only one cipher in use for internal communication. It should have been clear that under such conditions the volume of traffic would have been so great as to supply enough data to risk compromising the only cipher. Obviously the more ciphers in use the less will be the risk of any one being broken, and it is pro bable that each HQ will require at least two - one for upward and one for downward communication with the possible addition of the Inter- Service Cipher in some cases. The normal practice in Palestine was to use the Army Cipher between Divisions and Brigades and the Inter-Service Cipher 'when required for working to the Navy and the R.A.F., the Palestine Cipher being used below Brigade HQ. Approximately 20 copies of the latter were provided for each battalion, but for purposes of safe custody the unit held the least possible number of copies and the remainder were retained in pools at Brigade and higher headquarters for issue as re quired. It was found advisable for every detachment, however small, to hold some sort of cipher. In cases where the local cipher was not available it was sometimes forgotten that the Field Service Pocket Book provides an adequate alternative. It was noticeable on occasions that dilficulties occurred owing to staff officers failing to keep the cipher staff fully informed of the situation; and in one case serious confusion arose through a staff officer ordering a particular cipher to be withdrawn contrary to the standing instructions of the cipher officers,whom he had not consulted beforehand. There was also a tendency to misuse the N.C.O. cipher staff when traffic was light for such duties as Sergeants* Mess Caterer, etc,, which obvously affected the efficient working oi the system. It was evident that there was not a general appreciation of the dangers of compromising ciphers. Instances of referring to cipher messages by W/T in clear, and even by telephone, were not unknown. It would seem that a wider knowledge of Section III, Military Security Instructions 1926, is required by all who may have to initiate or handle cipher messages. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN INTERCOMi'.riJNICATluN LESSONS Operations of the type described in these pages will Uicari- &gt;th abnormal numbers of signal personnel and wide changes “ the org .tion and equipment of signal units. These wi vary m &gt;44816-1 62 and special scales are required to suit each local requirement. tire less is likely to be the primary means of intercommunication, and may even be the only safe and effective means. To meet requirements i n W/T, signal units will need more sets with longer range and a higher degree of mobility. The secondary means will often be the civil tele phone and telegraph system and it is unlikely that army land lines will be much used: for this reason signal units will require personnel and ' equipment suitable to maintain permanent lines and to operate - or supervise the operation of - the civil system. The telephone will probably be unsafe for secret messages and unreliable on account of sabotage. Visual signalling, especially by Verey Lights, will assume an unusual importance. Motor cyclist despatch riders will be much restricted by their vulnerability to ambush, and'it will usually be necessary to employ armed trucks for the Despatch Rider Letter Service. Finally it seems that more care is required in the forces in general to prevent leakage of information by carelessness in intercommunication, and this is especially the case with telephone conversations and the use of ciphers.44816-1 63 CHAPTER 8 ADMINISTRATION GENERAL It is not intended to describe here in any detail the numerous administrative problems which were presented by these operations, nor the solutions applied to them. The great majority owed their origin exclusively to the special conditions existing in Palestine at the time; and few of the lessons are likely to be capable of general application elsewhere. There are several reasons for this, of which geography accounts for most. Others originated through the unusual system of dual administration by Air Headquarters at Jerusalem and H.Q. British Troops at Cairo, which is scarcely likely to find a parallel anywhere else; and to the strange state of semi-war~semi‘-peace in which the army found itself - due to a great extent to the absence of Martial Law. A certain number of minor lessons of an administrative nature are referred to in other chapters - notably No. 9 on ’’Transport' and No. 10 on 'Weapons and Equipment' ~ and it is necessary here to refer only to two outstanding general points which will almost certainly arise again some day. The first is an old story and is summed up in the one word 'Improvisation'. There is little need to enlarge upon this, except to say that where a military garrison in normal times contains no detach ments of Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals or Royal Army Ordnance Corps, then the administrative staffs must be prepared to resort to extensive improvisation in an emergency. The other point, which has been referred to already, is that operations on active service cannot be conducted under conditions of peace-time accounting without causing inconvenience and much extra work for troops in the field and for staffs. The British Pbrces in Palestine were declared to be 'On Active Service' with effect from the 21st May. At that time there were two main factors which prompted the Air Officer Commanding to make the declaration: the first was to ensure that casualties in action were placed on the same footing so far as pensions etc. were concerned as normal war casualties, and the other was to give commanders in the field those powers under Military Law which are applicable only to active service. Under instructions from the War Office, however, 'Active Service' was limited in its application to Military Law, discipline, and wills alone, and did not affect the normal financial scale and entitlements (except to exempt battle casualties from hospital stoppages), nor the normal accounting procedure. The effect of this modification was to burden officers with much paper work on matters such as a rifle butt shattered by an enemy bullet, a lorry damaged by a road mine, clothing destroyed in a train derailment, and so on. It also entailed innumerable courts of inquiry, which would never have been necessary in war, on casualties and material losses due directly to the operations. It is questionable v/hether the financial saving effected in this way really amounted to much, but it is certain that the system was the cause of considerable irritation and took up far too much of the time of units and staffs already overworked and usually short-handed. On the other hand it did undoubtedly avoid some hardship by permitting the continuance of subsistence allowances, which would not otherwise have been issuable on active service. However, on the whole experience went to show that once active service conditions exist in the field the administrative system will be better placed in to to on an active service footing, and conducted in accordance with Field Service. Regulations, Vol.I. This of course requires the publi cation by the War Office of a special Army Order amending Appendix IV, King’s Regulations 1935, to govern the altered conditions.44616-1 64 THE SYSTEM OP ADMINISTRATION Prior to the arrival of the Emergency Force in September, local administration of all forces in Palestine (other than those of the fin Navy) was the concern of the A.O.C., while the G-.O.G. , Egypt, was ^ responsible for the general administration of the troops. This systet has already been referred to earlier in the chapter: though it had it disadvantages there is no doubt that it was the best one under the circumstances, and it conferred at least one henefit in giving Palesti direct access to the substantial administrative resources then concenfr*. in Egypt for the 'Italian Emergency'. The effect of the system was to constitute Egypt as the Base for Palestine with KQ 'British Trooos in Egypt' in the position of a sort of HQ Lines of Communication. In September the Base was changed to Haifa, though Egypt still remained a subsidiary source of supply. In view of their responsibili. ties regarding general administration, 'British Troops in Egypt' under-' took the preparation of the Base - even though it was in Palestine - ani operated it until the Emergency Force had completed deployment and there were sufficient resources available in the country for the responsibdr to be transferred to the G.O.C. Palestine. From that time onwards ^ ' administration in Palestine reverted to the normal methods of war. The general lay-out and system in operation in October is shown in Map No. 1. MAINTENANCE me maintenance of personnel in the field was practically confined to tne clespatch of reinforcing units.

(about 75 r.p.g. ) These figures are averages over the period of four months preceding the arrival of the Emergency Force, when the total strength of the forces was between 4,000 (in May) and 11,000 (in September). Mortar bomb expenditure rose rapidly later as more weapons, ammunition, and trained detachments became available. vVhen the Haifa Base was established in September a certain amount of material, especially mortar bombs, M.T. vehicles and parts, etc., came direct from England to the Base Depots; but the L. of C. from Egypt by rail to the C.S.D. Sarafand was still utilized to a large extent. There were no animals in the force, except for a few pack donkeys and the horses of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Farce, and one consequence of this was that there were never any difficulties regarding water supplies - a strange contrast to the part v/ater played in Palestine in the Great War. During operations in the hills water for personnel was carried by M.T. as far as tracks permitted either in 4-gallon tins, 6-gallon mule tanks, 12-gallon camel tanks (’’fantasses') or improvised water-tank lorries, and thence by donkey pack in 4-gallon tins - four or six tins per animal. Transport is discussed in further detail in Chapter 9. QUABTEBS The operations took place almost entirely during the dry summer season, and tented camps with structures provided by the B.A. F. Works and Buildings Dept, under contract formed the normal accommodation. The double ridge tent was the type mostly in use and was found to be preferable to the bell tent. At first the supply of tentage in Palestine was sufficient only for one battalion, and it was necessary for reinforce ments to bring their own tents with them from Egypt. This had various disadvantages. The local reserve of tentage had first to be used to get a camp ready for a unit on its arrival. Immediately afterwards the original camp was struck in order to release tents for the next comers, and a new camp erected with the unit tentage which had been brought up from Egypt. It resulted in a considerable waste of labour and trans port as well as excessive wear on the few available tents. It also caused delays to train moves, since trucks loaded with tents had to be ferried, two or three at a time, across the Suez Canal at Kantara. Eventually a reasonable reserve of tentage was accumulated at Sarafand, and a small Ordnance Camp Depot was formed there. In some places - notably Jerusalem, Haifa and Nablus — suitable billeting accommodation was available. District Commissioners had powers to requisition for this purpose, and things were facilitated by the numbers of buildings lying empty as a direct consequence of the rebellion. Work had ceased at most schools and colleges owing to44816-1 66 students* strikes, hotels were at a standstill vith^no tourist traffic p oc port workers had struck in the transit sheds at Jafxa ? the Levant Pair at Tel Aviv was in a state of decay; and all were made use of to accoia. modate troops, Jerusalem presented the most difficulty, since it con- wi1 tained the largest concentration of troops and many of its schools, I a c hospices etc,, were foreign owned. Here the appointment of a Town se. Major, who worked in the offices of the District Administration, por facilitated matters considerably. It was also necessary to appoint op( Claims Officers in the areas to assess damages to property and, in close' th&lt; co-operation with the civil authorities, to deal with extensive and complicated claims from billet owners of every imaginable race and creed. Before the coming of the rains in early November it was essentia; ^ to get all troops under cover, and this presented a formidable problem as the end of the rebellion saw many prospective billets reverting to ca . their normal uses. In the end however most units were found billets of ^ some sort, while the rest were provided with temporary hutments erected in a very short time by utilising the entire R.E. resources of the Force for the purpose. Rer THE SERVICES | i ta] re] Survey Service 1 th&lt; A Corps Survey Section accompanied the Emergency Force from England l Prior to its arrival the Government Survey Department at Jaffa took the gu] place of a military survey service. 1 if sei Chaplains and G rav es S ervices The organization of the Chaplains Service was normal and calls for Qai no special comment, except perhaps to mention the work of the Chaplains in conducting tours of religious sites which did much to occupy the troops in the time which occurred between the end of the rebellion and th the evacuation of the Emergency Force. i- n ca No G-raves Service was required, since all burials were carried out ne in the military cemetery at Ramleh under arrangements made by the R.A.F, mu&lt; General Hospital at Sarafand. Pa; it Medical Service an' An account of the work of the medical service is contained in Appendix VI. r^ r Pay Service Ra Up to September pay duties were performed by army pay offices in w i Egypt. kith the arrival of the Emergency Force, Command and Regimental an Pay Offices were opened in Palestine, the former in Jerusalem and the me latter in Haifa. Tr Provost Service en em It is an interesting reflection upon the high standard of disciple under conditions of long hours and hard work to note that no military wh police were required in Palestine prior to the arrival of the Emergenc) ^ Force. In the latter appropriate Corps, Divisional and L. of C. Provo^ at units were included. [ as to Labour and Hirings Service I S V The duties of these services were carried out by civil government wo officials in conjunction with officers of the administrative staffs? Tov/n Majors and Claims Officers. Convict labour was used to a certam extent, though the government being used to provide labour. ipn.qtal Service 44816-1 67 The civil postal system continued to work throughout the rebellion, though with considerable delay. Military correspondence was distributed by means of a courier service with the daily convoys and by Despatch Riders, and the Army seldom used the civil system. In September postal units, staffed by the G.P.O. , London, with Supplementary Reservists, arrived with the Emergency Force and opened an Army Post Office. This accelerated deliveries and gave the troops ■die benefit of cheap rates for private correspondence. Printi ng and Stationery Service There was no local army organization for this purpose. Printing was carried out by the Government Press in Jerusalem, while stationery was supplied from England or Egypt and supplemented by local purchase. R emount and Veterinary Services The operations in Palestine in 1936 must have been the first to be under taken by a force of the British Army in which neither of these services were represented, since - apart from the T.J.F.F. - there was not a single horse in the field. Supplies and Transport Service Supplies have already been referred to earlier in this Chapter, and .a separate chapter — No. 9 - is devoted to transport. Canteen Service By calling upon resources in Egypt, with some reinforcement from England, the N.A.A.F.I. in Palestine was able to expand from 13 branches in April to 120 in October. No mobile canteens were used and, as units were seldom out oi camps for more than 24 hours at a time, they were probably unnecessary, need of books, papers, etc., in camps and posts away from the main towns was^ much felt, and was supplied later through the generosity of local residents m Palestine and Egypt who sent literature to central collecting stations, whence it was distributed through the normal supply system. _ The Jewish Agency a s° did much to help, both in supplying recreational facilities and reading matter and in running special canteens. Transportation Service The Transportation Service was concerned with the working of the Palestine Railways and its connection with the Egyptian S^ate Railways sys em, an oo with the working of the docks at Haifa. There was no inland water transport, and no light railways other than those forming part of the Palestine Gov m- ment railway system. In view of the special administrative responsibilities of Egypt, the Transportation Service was initiated and maintained from -^SyP • ' the ensure close liaison between the two commands ana o a ov Palestine employment of staffs, one officer performed the dual role of A.D and Egypt. He was permanently represented in Palestine by a D.A.D. In ^ Hail a, who was' an expert railwayman with previous experience in Pa 1 ”' e A P M G (M) his office in'the headquarters of the Railways, while there was a Da.Q.M.G.W at Ibrce HQ in Jerusalem.

Works and Buildings Department under a Section Officer through the medium of local contracts, supplemented in the la.ter stages by the services of the R.E. units of the force. Though the ’Works and Buildings Staff was reinforced by Royal Engineer assistance, the works services in Palestine were not transferred to the Army until 1937. Engineer Stores Service This service was not represented in Palestine until after the arrival of the Emergency Force, when an Engineer Stores Depot was opened at Haifa Base by the 6th Field Park Coy R.E. Prior to that a small reserve of certain engineer stores was supplied from Egypt and held at Sarafand in the C.S.D. and later in the Ordnance Camp Depot. Ordnance Service Until June 1936 a single Staff Sergeant was the sole representative of the R.A.O.C. in Palestine. With the exception of a very small reserve in the C.S.D., ordnance stores and ammunition were supplied from Egypt as required. Later a D.A.D.O.S. was appointed on the formation of the Combined Staff, and simultaneously an Ordnance Camp Depot and an Ordnance Mobile Workshop were opened at Sarafand. The former held a small reserve of tentage, barbed wire, sandbags, Verey pistols and cartridges, entrenching tools, water supply stores, etc., and materials for the repair of M.T. vehicles. Ammunition was still supplied through the C.S.D., while all other ordnance stores continued to te supplied direct from Cairo. The first Ordnance Mobile Workshop (No. 2) was formed at Sarafand from the special Light Aid Detachment which had accompanied the Tank Company from Egypt on the 8th May. The O.M.W. carried out the second line repairs and recoveries of 'A” and 'B' vehicles, which had been undertaken hitherto by local R.A.S.C. units. Until the 1st Division arrived the Tanks and the two Cavalry Regiments were the only units which had their own L.A.D's. At the beginning of August No.l O.M.W. arrived from Mersa Matruh and replaced No.2 at Sarafand. No.2 O.M.W. then moved to Haifa. The arrival of the Emergency Force necessitated the establishment of an Ordnance Depot and Vehicle Reception Park in the Base Area at Haifa, while three Infantry Brigade L.A.Ds. and a Recovery Section accompanied the 1st Division. The latter was renamed No.3 O.M.W. and moved to Sarafand, The final Ordnance lay-out in October is shown in Map No.l. It fell to the Ordnance Service to disembark and collect in the V.R.P. a+u Haifa all vehicles of the Emergency Force. In all 838 vehicles were unloaded, put into running order, and driven by R.A.O.C. drivers to the V.R.P., the average unloading rate being 15 per hour. Vehicles were collected later !y unit drivers irom the V.R.P., where they sometimes remained for as long as two weeks. This system threw a heavy strain upon a sma.ll R.A.O.C. organization, which would have been avoided had unit drivers accompanied vehicles at sea. Little repair work was in fact needed to get them on the roads, but a number oi small jo os had to be done by the V.R.P. personnel which should normally have been carried out in the units. Recovery work in Palestine was difficult owing to the hilly nature of the^ country, 7 ' and the wide dispersion of units. It was complicated by the fact movement at night was dangerous and the usual strength of an O.M.W. did not permit of a recovery party being away for more than one day. Rail transport was sometimes used to evacuate crashed vehicles to the O.M.W. The chief repair work came from the light tanks which were kept in service by replaciuS engines, gear-boxes etc. as required in the O.M.W. No. 2 O.M.W. in a period of four months passed 175 vehicles through its workshops. The maximum number of vehicles ever based on this unit was 450. Total mileage of No. 2 O.M.W. vehicles was 7600; and 14 recoveries were effected, all of them due to accidents•Photograph No. 1344816-1 69 CHAPTER 9 TRANSPORT GENERAL To enaole troops oo get to grips with a cautious and elusive eneiny fighting in his native hills a nigh degree of mobility was of the first impoi tance, and two main factors contributed towards its attainment* HiXtensive^ services of fast mechanical transport gave the Government forces a strategic mobility which was denied to their opponentsj while the provision of pack animal transport^ coupled with a good standard of physical fitness, succeeded in reducing the natural advantages enjoyed by the enemy in moving across difficult roadless country. M.T. furnished a means of moving reserves very rapidly to points within confer table marching distance of intended scenes of action and thus enabled economy of force to be effected; while pack transport, by avoiding any overloading of the soldier, brought him nea.rer to the standard of his lightly •equipped opponent and freed him for a day or two at least from dependence upon a line of communication. The part played by Transport therefore was so grear as to justify its consideration in s cmc oat ail. But before doing so it is worth recording that the opera tions provided yet another demonstration that the mobility provided~by physical fitness was w r hat counted in the end, and no transport facili ties could compensate for its absence. In fact it was only too clear that where M.T. was being very widely used greater care than ever was necessary to ensure that the cross-country performance of the soldier on foot did not deteriorate. It is perhaps too often assumed as a matter of course that a native hillman in his own country is more than a match in speed for the British soldier: in Palestine this was found to be true in the initial stages of an advance, but the Arab’s staying power is poor and if followed up resolutely it was found that a point was soon reached where a well-trained infantryman used to hill work would start to overtake him. The moral effect of this discovery upon both sides can well be appreciated. EMPLOYMENT OF MECHANICAL TRANSPORT Roads and Tracks A fairly extensive network of main roads existed in all parts of the country lying to the North of Jerusalem; and all roads marked on Map No.l are main roads. They are available in all weathers for all types of motor vehicles: surf’aces are metalled throughout and gradients w r ell engineered, though for most of their length the roads wind their way through steep hill country where good driving and high engine power is required. The second-class roads with a few exceptions run through generally level districts: their surface is either hard earth or sand with a stony bottom and in summer they are passable to all vehicles up to 2-tons. Tracks are plentiful everywhere and in summer will often take M.T. vehicles which have a good cross-country performance, especially if fitted with sand tyres. In the hills it was invariably found, even on foot, that however devious the tracks might appear they provided the quickest routes and were always preferable to any direct course on a compass bearing.Development of M«T&gt; services 44816-1 70 In April 1936 the two infantry battalions had neither mechanical nor pack transport of their own, being organized on a basis of horse transport, though this was in fact nevtu as -d* ff 1 '- only military K.j, were the 8 cans, 20-30-cut six-wheeled lorries, 2 ambulances and 2 technical vehicles of 14 Coy It.A*3*C* For troop—carrying purposes in emergency reliance was placed upon hired vehicles, which were available in Palestine in almost limitless quantities — the country possessed some 1000 buses alone - and arrangements existed for obtaining them at very short notice# On the outbreak of the rebellion sufficient were taken up at once and retained on a. day—to—day oasis ^o suit the require* ments of the moment# At this stage the A#A#S#C. vehicles were employe; upon supply duties, while the chief use of the hired fleet was to rush troops from one fresh outbreak to another wherever their services were most urgently required# By this means alone it was possible with onlj two battalions to avoid any single instance of police being overwhelmed before military help could arrive. By the end of May increases in the garrison had required more transport for supply purposes and 17 Coy R.A.S.C. was moved up from Bgypt to reinforce 14 Coy. The first unit to provide service transport for troop-carrying purposes was the Royal Air Force Lifting Company from Mersa Matruh, whicr arrived on the 2nd June. It was equipped with 40 Ford V8 2-ton trucks and provided a suitable lift for an entire battalion at Home Establish ment strength. It was used to provide lOOfo mobility for the 2nd Bn. The Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, which them became the only completely motorised unit in Palestine. It was followed by the 8th Hussars on the 28th June with their own full establishment of Ford ?8 'pick-ups'# The remaining battalions were still dependent upon hired vehicles, and by then the chief use of M.T# was to carry striking forces to the scenes of actions arising as a result of chance encounters. On the 20th July an R.A.S.C. Lifting Company - No. 19 — arrived from Egypt, and for the first time started to replace hired vehicles with W#D. transport. From this point R.A.S.C. detachments were attached to battalions for tactical transport purposes. It was not until the arrival of the Emergency Force from England that infantry units were seen in Palestine with their own 1st Line M.T. With their arrival it was x j °ssible to reduce civilian hirings, but a number were still retained up to the end of the rebellion. In the later stages M.T. was used tactically to a greater extent than before in carrying ^ infantry columns with their pack animals to points from which encircling movements could be made in the more deliberate operations which had become possible by that time. HIRED CIVILIAN M.T. M.T. hirings during the rebellion averaged some 200 vehicles a day, comprising about 14^ buses, 18^ cars and lorries, and cost roughly E450 daily. After the first two or three weeks it was fort® ately possible to deal with one contracting fir. only, which greatly simplified arrangements. To begin with, Arab transport companies “ which would otherwise have been on strike - were mostly employee, om were noo \eiy satisfactory. As intimidation increased drivers reg®- higher wages and greater military protection, and soon it became cle® that most of the profits found their way into the rebel coffers.^ ch.au point all Arao contracts were ended and hi rings placed in tie fy ox one oi oho big Jewish bus companies under the auspices of the g Agency, which guaranteed (and amply fulfilled) a supply of the rigM sore oi drivers and vehicles to meet all military requirements wftickB might arise.44816-1 71 The Jevrs proved to he better drivers on the whole than the Arabs and were more reliable. The better ones were excellent and there were many notable cases of coolness and bravery under fire among these men: the poorer ones at times showed a tendency to abandon their vehicles too soon when fired at, but it was only necessary to report a man to the Jewish Agency to secure his instant replacement. Vehicles too which broke down were always replaced at once and no repair organization, beyond first aid, was therefore necessary. Civilian drivers were unarmed, but were issued ■'with steel helmets, field dressings, blankets and rations. It was found that they usually acquired something approaching a khaki uniform - sometimes of striking originality. For the most part the Jewish drivers gave cheerful, keen and loyal service and their value was usually in proportion to the interest shown in them by the units to which they were attached. Care was necessary to give them reasonable protection in Arab areas and, in addition to accommodating the drivers inside the camps, an armed soldier had always to accompany each vehicle. For the rest the inevitable friendliness of the British soldier did much to get the best out of the Jew who drove his transport. On the whole the hired transport gave good service, though naturally neither the discipline of the drivers nor the mechanical efficiency of the vehicles were up to military standard. Vehicle equipments usually needed augmenting for military purposes, but otherwise little alteration was necessary. Contrary to the recommendations of ' Imperial Policing 1954 ' it was seldom found necessary to remove windscreens or to fit wire netting. Armour was tried in certain special vehicles which were employed on duties likely to draw more fire than usual, and was useful around the cab and lower part of the windscreen to give confidence to civilian drivers. Sandbag protection to the bodies was found to be too heavy and affected steering on twisting mountain roads. Wire-netting was fitted to a few W.D. vehicles for special employment in town riots, but had the grave dravAiack of preventing troops from dismounting rapidly, for this reason it could never be used outside towns and was n^ver regarded with much favour even for riot purposes. Types of hired vehicles Hired cars were mostly good high-powered American saloons of the Ford V8 quality. They were roomy and fast with a good cross-country capacity, but suffered again from the drawback of being difficult uo get out of in a hurry. Open tourers would have been infinitely better, but unfortunately none were to be had. It was also difficult for aircraft to distinguish these hired saloons, and devices were tried such as whitewashing roofs etc. In the early stages eacn motorise infantry company had sufficient cars to lift one platoon, which could either act as advanced guard to a bus or lorry column or could speed on ahead of the remainder to a point where reinforcements were urgently awaited. Later, as more troops became available, this small margin of extra speed was seldom required and far more necessary was an ability to get into action immediately on coming under fire. From this point cars were used mostly for communication purposes or to carry commanders and staff officers. Buses were of the single deck type, fast, and with a surprising cross-country performance: they were readily available in largo o:rs and provided a degree of shelter and comfort for troops unobtainable in other vehicles. They were however veritable death traps m areas where they were likely to come under sudden fire, and their use had to be restricted to non-tactical moves. In some cases_the tops were removed and this converted them into good troop-carrying vehicles, u o er wise they were far too difficult to get out of in an emergency.44816-1 72 The lorries used were mostly 3-ton trucks of high-powered American make* They carried 15 men and were very last and handy on the main roads, while their performance on rough tracks was remarkable. They needed some simple fitting for a Lewis gun, and also a spotlight on a wandering lead which could be used for the examination of the road and the vehicle. Additional high sides had to be fitted to those used for transporting pack donkeys. In addition to troop-carrying vehicles a number of hired lorries were adapted for special purposes* 50—cwt or 2- l ;on trucks of the fast Federal,’Chevrolet and Ford types were fitted with W/T, Vickers guns, and naval searchlights, all designed to be operated from the vehicle; while 5y-ton six-wheelers were used to mount naval pom-poms and the 3-pdr gun. Most of these carried armour for the protection of the driver, and some had in addition armoured sides to the bodies. Mortars, and some of the Vickers guns, were mounted in V.D. 15-cwt trucks, A few of the troop-carrying lorries were fitted with amour for use in special districts to act as substitutes for amoured cars, and for this purpose they were of value, though the armour tended, to make them too heavy and unwieldy for normal purposes. Their use was practically confined to the level roads lined by dense orange groves, where night ambushes took a heavy toll of troops in unarmoured vehicles, and to places where only amoured vehicles could halt with safety. SERVICE M.T. Technical points regarding service vehicles, which came to light durii: 1936 are described in the following chapter on ’’Weapons and Equipment', and it is necessary here only to refer to their uses, advantages and dis advantages. As regards cars, it was found that the 2-seater was suited neither to the country nor to the tactical requirements, which demanded an amed escort an every vehicle in addition to the driver. The disadvant ages of saloon bodies have already been referred to, and undoubtedly the best car was an open four-seater which could carry the driver and his escort in front and the passengers behind and from which a. quick descent could be made from both sides of the car. In this direction, the normal -pattern body is not always conveniently designed, and an open oody without doors - such as used by the German Army for instance - would have been better. The Austin 18’s and 20 r s supplied to the any nad insufficient clearance and not enough liveliness of engine to suit the country: the Hillmans were better, and the Ford V8’s best of all. use for troops-carrying were the Morris 15-cwt CS.3.I, trucks of the R.A.F. Lifting Coy and the 15 —curt Ford pick' .ssars. All were fitted with 1050 x 16 sand tyres. . there was considerable difference of opinion as to The Morris was handy and had a very good perfomr he comfort of the Fords, while its ca.Tying capacity Tver was small though convenient for working on a secuici Trucks in the 2-ton Ford ups of the 8th Hussars. All were fitted with 1050 x 16 sand tyres. All were good and there was considerable difference of opinion as to which was the best, ance but lacked the ox 7 men and a driver was small though convenient for working on basis. xhe a.A.E. Ford carried 14 men find a driver or alternatively 3^ to 6 donkeys which gave it a considerable advantage. It was more silent buunless handy than the Morris. The Gth Hussar pick-up was a specially fitted vehicle carrying a mounted Vickers-Bertier gun and a section of 4 men. The body was mounted on a standard car chassis and was the fastest and most silent of all trucks. ^oC-cwt lorries were mostly either 4-wheeled or 6-wheeled Morris'* The 4—wheeled OS.11. lorry, which was fitted with 1050 x 16 tyres, had altogether a better performance particularly in sand than the 6-wheeler,44816-1 73 which had 750 x 20 tyres. Furthermore the 'well”-shaped body of the 6-wheeler made it unsuitable for carrying donkeys. The four-wheeler could carry 13 men and the driver or, if the seats were removed, about 8 donkeys. On the road it could travel comfortably with a column of light trucks but its cross-country performance was not so good. The Morris 2-tonner, again with 1050 x 16 tyres, was generally a more useful vehicle than the 30cwt, and in the later stages proved most suitable to act as a ’’RODEX' fitted with W/T to work on the move. The 3-tonners were mostly Leylands or Guys fitted for special purposes, such as workshops etc., and were seldom used for troop carrying owing to their slowness and poor cross-country performance on tracks. Trailers were found to be generally unsuited to the twisty hill roads and those which carried such apparatus as an R/3. Fd. Coy. Air Compressor etc. reduced the speed of a 3-ton convoy by as much as 5 m.p.h. ORGANIZATION OF TACTICAL TRANSPORT Only two units - 8th Hussars and Bedfs. &amp; Herts. - had sufficient First Line transport permanently allotted to them to carry lOQ?o of their personnel, and in few cases was so high a degree of mobility actually required. The number of vehicles required varied considerably with the type of role filled by the unit as well as with its fighting strength. The ideal was achieved if all personnel not employed on guards, picquets, camp duties etc. could be carried in M.T. and still leave sufficient vehicles for machine-guns, mortars, ammunition, food, blankets or greatcoats (for cold nights in the hills), sufficient water to rofil each water-bottle once, and the pack donkeys. Some typical motor transport figures are given in Appendix VII. In some cases R.A.S.C. Mechanical Transport detachments were more or less permanently allotted to battalions, living with them - except for periodical reliefs for mechanical maintenance purposes - and becoming to all intents and purposes a part of their battalions. In other cases ’’stand—by' parties of reserve M.T. were maintained at suitable R.A.S.C. centres and allotted as required. The size of these parties varied from two 15—cwt trucks, to carry either a section with some stores or two sections without stores, to a complete 'company lift'. Both systems worked well and varied according to local conditions, the essential being to organize the transport on a tactical unit basis, the most suitable being a 'company lift' capable of sub-division when required down to sections. ORGANIZATION OF M.T. COLUMNS The protection of M.T. columns is dealt with from the tactical side in Chapter 14, and it is only necessary here to refer to their general organization. Three tjqpes of columns had to be considered, ohose composed exclusively of W.D. vehicles, those with hired vehicles^mixed with military ones, and escorted convoys composed chiefly of civilian cars, lorries and buses. The following rules were evolved for .applica tion to the first type, and to a lesser degree to the second as well, but never became much more than a pious hope so far as the third was concerned. For the latter the best ingredients for a successful journey were the organization of vehicles into groups under an officer, the leading of each group by a military vehicle, an inspection to eliminate overloaded or obviously inefficient vehicles, the abandonmen o ve c.es which stopped from pure negligence - such as petrol shortage - and, so far as it was possible, a preliminary explanation to the drivers as to what was expected of them.44816- 1 74 Col'jmn Commanders Big columns often included parties of all three Services and in such cases the command was vested in the senior officer irrespective of the Service to v/hich he might happen to helcng: this sometimes produced anomalies in seniority, hut in the end gave unquestionably the best results. Before starting it was always essential for a plan to be drawn up and communicated to all officers not only as to the action to be taken on meeting enemy opposition but also as to the policy regarding abandonment of stranded vehicles. Crouping of vehicles It was found that a group of 20 vehicles was about as much as one officer could conveniently manage and columns were grouped accordingly vehicles being sorted out to make each group as homogenious as possible. It was best to eliminate the slower 5-tonners altogether if possible and run them as a separate column. The grouping system could seldom be applied properly to civilian convoys, the speed of which became of necessity that of the slowest vehicle. Distances between vehicles Since there was little congestion on the roads and most of the columns were comparatively small, the question of taking up road space was of little importance: the twisting hilly nature of the roads and the special tactical conditions were the chief considerations and led to a much more open spacing than would have been necessary in Buropean warfare. When travelling at 20 m.p.h. a distance of 400 yds between vehicles gives a driver no more than 40 seconds to pull up in an emergency, which was found to be none too much to keep him well clear of any traps^into which the leading vehicle might fall, particularly when descending steep hills. 400 yards was therefore set as the distance between vehicles in small columns of half a dozen or less. Larger columns were run with at least 50 yards between vehicles and 400 yards between every fifth one. At night the space between individual vehicles was opened out to 100 yds. It was found that drivers needed considerable practice to keep these increased distances, and at first had usually a vepy vague idea what 400 yards distance looked like; but once usod uo^it it helped to speed up movement and minimise the effects o .nuny action. ihe fact that the enemy seldom could see the total ^ngth of a column ao any one time made him cautious and was sometimes the means of letting a single vehicle pass unscathed through an ambush: it also made it more difficult for him to follow a favourite practice ° off the last vehicle on a road whore it was impossible vehlcles in front-to turn round.

With civilian convoys the abandonment of a vehicle meant that it would at least he looted and prooahly burnt, hut even so it was extraordinary how lightheartedly the local driver v/ould sometimes set out with insufficient petrol or glaring mechanical defects. Strongly worded public warnings, ruthless elimination of doubtful vehicles at the start, and occasional abandon ment in particularly bad cases helped to reduce but never entirely to remove this nuisance. Night Movement Normally the leading vehicle in every column had to bum headlights in order to detect road-blocks and mines, the remaining vehicles travell ing with side-lights only. On special occasions the bright moonlight or even starlight of the Palestine summer was sufficient to enable columns to move slowly v/ithout any lights, but too often the noise dispelled secrecy just as much as the lights. In this respect the Fords were at a definite advantage. ANIMAL TRANSPORT The types available The two original infantry battalions had horse transport, but owing to the distances involved and the speed of movement this was never used outside local barrack duties. The T.J.F.F. cavalry had pack horses for their Hotchkiss gun troops and two per half squadron for officers' kits and rations, but otherwise no horse transport was used during the rebellion. Camels were readily available and were equal to 2vj mules or donkeys each in carrying capacity: on the other hand they were slow and conspicuous, and were little used for military purposes. Further more in wet weather they are of little use, as experiences in Palestine in the G-reat TZar amply proved. Mules were available in small quantities, but had few advantages over the local donkey, which was in universal civilian use and which could be more easily transported by h.T. The donkey therefore became more or less supreme for pack transport and proved to be a great asset. When carried in L.T., donkeys enabled columns to move v 'apidly to the selected areas, leave the roads lor the tracks, and operate for some 48 hours away from their vehicles. ino Palestinian donkeys varied enormously in size but were up to a comfort able load of 100-150 lbs and took readily to their lorries after a little practice. They were available locally in large quantites, out were mostly in Arab hands and a good deal of intimidation and^delibera e obstruction had to be overcome to secure the better types. ^ ihe aveiage rate of advance of small .columns with donkeys in difficult hill country was about 2 kilometres per hour by day and half that oy night. Scale of pack donkeys Some figures regarding the numbers of donkeys employed are given in Appendix VIII. The minimum requirements were sufficient to carry Mortars, one refill per water-bottle, ammunition and the machine—guns, though the introduction of the Bren gun may enable tho latter to be eliminated in future. It was found to be quite essential or uu.mos to hold this minimum number on their permanent estrblishnun s, anci is was necessary not only for obvious purposes of training u a '■ avoid the inevitable loss of secrecy which always attende an N a -'-mp to hire donkeys for some particular operation.Management of donkeys On first arrival donkeys were found to be temperamental and, in the absence of their native boys, took a little time to get used to soldier drivers# A few days’ training however soon produced satisfactory results and, though boys were usually required to look after the donkeys when not in use, it was necessary to have soldiers available who v/ere used to them to lead them on operations. Similarly it was found that the donkeys disliked their M.T. until they had had a few quiet runs in the lorries, when most of them began to enjoy it and gave little trouble in getting in and out. Their normal ration was six gallons of water and up to ten pounds of forage a day, though in the field they often did quite well on seven pounds. The local custom was to feed them in the early morning, late afternoon, and last thing at night, the feed being three parts tibbin (chopped straw) to one part barley. In camp waste products from the cookhouse were a welcome addition. Loading donkeys in M.T. For transport purposes the smaller donkeys were preferable, as they could be lifted bodily into the lorries and six men could load a lorry with half a dozen donkeys in about 15 minutes, whereas the bigger animals had to be loaded by ramp -and required much patience and pushing. The following rough drill was evolved for the loading and off loading of donkeys, the team consisting of an N.C.O. and six men, the vehicle a 30-cwt Morris, and the load eight saddled donkeys. Apparatus required was:- 2 Long Pickets. 2 Spare ropes, 10 yds. 50 Sand Bags. 4 Ropes, 10 yds. Some forage. These are used to fill the gap between floor and tailboards.

Here the railway ran for 44816-144816-1 77 the most part through deep winding gorges above which were steep inaccessible hills with villages well beyond the reach of M.T. In such country the railway was clearly the quickest means of getting troops to the required spot, mid on one occasion when a drive of the area took place a cordon was quickly established by running a special train down the line from which detachments were dropped at suitable points en route. For the moves of reinforcements and supplies the Lyuda-Kan tara line (301 kms) bore the brunt of the traffic. It had many drawbacks: it was single track throughout and there was a shortage of rolling stock - particularly flats - on the Palestine side, so that Egyptian stock had to be moved to and fro by the tedious process of ferrying across the Suez Canal. Furthermore the danger of accidents from sabotage was always considerable and no night running was possible in Palestine. An example of the difficulties of rail movements is afforded by the train which brought up a company of tanks ■which formed one of the first rein forcements. The train left Cairo at 9 p.m. on May 9th and did not reach Haifa until 7.45 a.m. on the 11th, a journey which in normal times is completed in 15 hours. The deficiencies of the only other route - the Sinai road - served to throv/ an added strain upon the railv/ay. The road was liable to sudden interruption by weather and was never intended to take heavier traffic than a few tourists 1 motor cars daily. To avoid serious damage it was therefore necessary to send heavy lorries and the armoured cars of the 11th Hussars by train, while small columns of lighter vehicles which could have come by road were often too vulnerable to move on the long stretch between the Egyptian frontier and Jerusalem without special protective measures. Consequently they too travelled mostly by train. However with all its drawbacks the railway managed successfully to provide almost the only line of communication to the outside world from April to September, when the Base was changed from Egypt to Haifa. THE AIAIN TRANSP O RT LESSONS The chief lesson which emerged was the value of light fast motor transport, combined with motor-borne pack donkeys, to give the troops an all-round superiority in mobility over their lightly equipped native opponents. The importance of pack animals to enable columns to get off the roads and subsist without lines of communication was clearly shown. The superiority of the donkey for this purpose proved once again tna the animal most v/idely used by the inhabitants is usually the be^t or military purposes. The employment of hired M.T. proved a very successful substitute for a large fleet of service vehicles, and 'will probably a wayo e oO in organized countries possessing a network of good main roa s. ^ this connection a little nursing of the civilian drivers y e units to which they are attached will amply repay in reau s. Finally it is the mental and physical mobility o e r0 °^ themselves which wins in the end: no transport faci i les can rtq it, and the more motor transport is employed the more icu i to maintain the required standard.44816-1 78 PTER 10 WEAPONS iJE) EQUIK.ENT In this chapter it is intended to describe various devices v/hich were introduced or modifications developed to meet the particular needs of the operations. Some notes have also been included as to the advan tages and disadvantages of various standard equipments. Certain technical defects have been reported upon separately, and since many are inevitably of a secret nature further reference to them has been omitted from these pages. AidLUhED FIGHTING- VErUCLES panics Eighteen Light Tanks, Mark III, were in use in Palestine from May to November and covered a total mileage of 58,600. Out of the original eighteen, fifteen tanks were evacuated to Egypt for overhaul, and replaced after covering, since their previous overhaul, some 2000 to 2500 miles of which roughly Ibfo had been run in Palestine. Heavy replacements of track ana suspension parts were necessary, and experience showed that if tanks were to operate for any length of time in the rocky hill country profusion would have to be made for something approaching 100^ per month of all track ana suspension spares. The tanks were struck by bullets in about 14 actions, some of them being fired from as close a range as 15 yards; buo the only damages sustained, apart from two drivers wounded by bullet splash, rterr vr.o sietal containers on running ooards destroyed, together with tneir contents, and various lamps hit. xne ^rk III tank was found to have certain minor defects in design ^-C., generally’- by reason of its spe*ed and reliability proved to be an adidracle machine for its task. Although it was unable to render much assistance to infantry in the rocky hill country, except by keeping to ° lie :i5a ^ n roa ^ s or fairly well-defined tracks and wadis , it was able to go anywhere on -he plains and so undertake duties, particularly at night, which could be performed by no other arm. Sven in the hills tanks did saccced on several occasions in advancing slowly by roundabout routes to y '^ n or so of most inaccessible points, and had it not been for frequent breakages and shedding of tracks on extremely rocky ground OA ei r u ^fulness would have been still mo^re enhrtnced.

This dual arrangement proved invaluable, tne spoblight was used by the commander to swing from side to side while looking over the turret, while the headlamp on the gun provided a beam along which to shoot, since the spotlight and'the gun could not be operated simultaneously. The need for a beam of light along which to shoot ao nignt was keenly felt oy all units which were required to fire automatic weapons from vehicles, and led to the evolution of a special fitting which ib&gt; referred to later in this chapter and is des cribed in Appendix XII. Radio Telephony proved of the greatest value, but unfortunately was not available in all tanks. The Company brought with it two sets for Cpy&lt;*H»Q. and one for each of the five sections, and later one more was obtained; but had each tank been fitted with R/T, sub-section control - especially at night - would have been much simplified. On more than one occasion the tanks R ./1 proved of value in assisting the communica tions of the infantry with whom they were co-operating. The comparative ly short range of R/T on the No. 1 sets brought to light a lack of train ing in Morse on the part of tank commanders, and some intensive training had to be organized. It is worth noting that the use of R/T, especially at night, had its disadvantages from the point of view of the commander of a tank patrol. The wearing of earphones deadened the sound of the occasional sniper’s shot for which he might be listening while, if the tank was lying in ambush, conversation might easily give away its position. Armoured Cars Both the 11th Hussars and the R.A.F. Armoured Car Companies were equipped with Rolls-Royce cars which gave excellent service, though employed for the greater part of the time on the main roads. Cross country work, such as patrolling along the rough tracks beside the oil pipe-line, told very heavily on the cars and even on the main roads the mileage demanded of them was so great as to necessitate an ample reserve. The 11th Hussars had a reserve of only four cars, and needed at least twice that number. All cars suffered at first from difficulty in elevating their guns sufficiently to bring fire to bear on the hilltops from the deep valleys through which many of the roads led. It was also necessary at times to deal with enemy concealed in ditches at the roadside or even attempting to board the car. The Royal Air Force succeeded in modifying their Vickers mountings sufficiently to give an added eight degrees of eleva tion to the guns. But even this was not sufficient, and moreover it was often necessary to bring fire to bear from both sides of the car simultaneously. For this reason a Lewis gun was fitted in addition to the Vickers: it not only provided the essentials for close-in fighting but enabled fire to be continued in the case of one gun jamming. 11 had the disadvantage of exposing the gunner while actually firing, buo experience proved that in Palestine this risk was justified. Lhe mount ing adopted by the R.A.F., and in modified form by the 11th Hussars, was an aircraft gunner’s 'all round traverse ring' on the top of tne turret, and this proved entirely satisfactory. Again the need of bet ter light ing was felt, either in the form of an improved spotlight on the car or a separate armoured searchlight vehicle to each section of armoured cars. Luminous night sights were required for the guns, especially as the Uoe of tracer bullets was later forbidden. The inclusion of rifle grenades in the equipment of armoured cars^ was found to be most useful: this was especially noticeable at night in conjunction with a searchlight for plunging fire against an enemy con cealed in sangars. At times however the range was found to be inadequateand effective fire up to 600 yds. would have been a great aoset. Hand grenades proved effective against attackers within close range of the cars - again more often at night. The 11th Hussars found that belted ammunition resulted in bad cross feedings owing to rounds loosening during the continuous jolting of the car. This might have been obviated by the issue of stripless ammunition. Improvised Armoured Vehicles The uses of these vehicles have already been referred to in the pre ceding chapter: they consisted of the 'Fighting Motor fehicies' described below and a few armoured lorries for troop-carrying in special areas. Armour protection varied according to the particular requirements of the vehicle, and was often confined to the driver's cab. Sandbags were tried at first, but proved too heavy and bulky. The best form of armour was found to be double sheets of l/8-in. steel plate with 1^ inches of wood between them, and this proved both to be light enough and at the same time sufficiently bullet-proof to stand up to the sort of fire encountered; but to give genuine protection against heavy small arms fire the weight of steel required - particularly of the quality obtainable locally - would have been prohibitive. Even the light armour provided was a strain on engines and chassis and made steering heavy on mountain roads, while it is uncertain how long the vehicles would have stood up to it if sub jected to continuous hard service. FIGHTING MOTOR VEHICLES Vehicles mounting automatic weapons There were three categories of vehicles which mounted automatic weapons for firing from the vehicle either while stationary or when on the move, and all were used widely for road patrols and escorts. Vickers guns were mounted on tripods in both civilian lorries and 15-cwt. Morris trucks in the manner shown in Appendix IX, and it was found useful to have four vehicles per battalion fitted for this purpose. Vickers- Berthier guns were fitted in each of the Ford pick-ups of the 8th Hussars on a specially designed mounting placed centrally and slightly to the rear in the body of the truck. The third category consisted of various vehicles mounting Lewis guns. The R.A.F. tenders and the Commers of the T.J.F.F. carried them in a Scarfe ring on top of the driver's cab, and this method proved entirely successful. In the Army vehicles they were usually car ried in a^central position in the body either on an anti-aircraft mounting or on an inprovised mounting devised by the R.A.S.C., which amounted to li .tie more than a piece of piping set vertically at a height slightly e j 01 ^ noriTla ^ A*A* mounting. Both methods were successful and i. was found to be advantageous to adapt all unit trucks to take a Where sufficient mountings are available it is b f y, t0 p* t ^ ree t0 each vehicle - on the centre of each side ^ tailboard. This arrangement gives better protection to the gun- f 1 en f es m fi re sitting or kneeling, and leaves more room for the remainder of the section when the gun is in action.

Railway Irolleys—a“ I ” model Ford Back-to-Back Unit.44816-1 81 strengthened 'by means of additional cross-members and channel-bars be tween the floor of the lorry and the frame of the chassis, and ^-inch armour plating was fixed to the sides and front and reinforced in some cases by protective mattresses. The driver's seat and the lower part of the windscreen were also armoured. Guns were fitted to the floors of the lorries on their original pedestal mountings and the shields were re tained. Five pom-pom lorries were employed with accompanying search light vehicles, the combined crew of each unit consisting of a naval officer and seven ratings, while the drivers were specially picked Jews who turned out to be exceptionally good. Crews were found at first by ' Durban 1 1 , 'Arethusa ', 'Sussex ' ( 2 ), and ' Cyclops ', but later were all taken over by ' Valiant ' on the departure of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron. The single 3-pr. lorry was manned in turn by the Haifa Heavy Battery R.A., H.M. S. 'Durban ' , ' Sussex ' and 'Valiant ', A method of mounting the mortar in a 15-cwt. truck is shov/n in Appendix X, and this gave steady and accurate fire from the vehicle. The possible traverse inside the truck was considerably restricted owing to the fixed position of the bipod, and sometimes the truck had to be manoeuvred in order to bring fire to bear in the required direction. This could however be reduced to a minimum by placing the mortar truck some five or six hundred yards behind the head of a column with a rifle escort in a separate truck: with this arrangement the mortar was usually in a position to fire to the front and flanks immediately on encountering opposition without any need of manoeuvring the vehicle. Some examples of gun lorries are shown in Photographs Nos. 14 to 16. TACTICAL RAILWAY VEHICLES At the start of the rebellion there were no armed or armoured vehicles available for tactical use on the railv/ay, and a number of these had to be improvised. They are described in detail in Appendix XI and illus trated in photographs Nos. 17, and 37 to 41. The original detachment of Royal Horse Artillery brought with them from Egypt 12 sets of motor trolley units. These consisted of old 'T' model Ford chassis mounted on railv/ay wheels and set in pairs back-to-back to avoid long runs in re verse. They carried two Lev/is guns to a unit and v/ere unarmoured. By the middle of June all but five had been put out of action either by breakdowns, derailments or damage from percussion bombs, and a little later only one unit still remained intact. Two replace tnem two new types of trolley were introduced. Twelve rord v'8. cars v/ere convex ^ed in the Egyptian State Railv/ays workshops into single light unarmoured 'pilot' trolleys for the daylight piloting of passenger brains, while twelve V8. commercial lorries were converted by the Palestine Railv/ays into six armoured 'back-to-back' units. Unfortunately it was not pos sible to adapt the Fords to run on the narrow gauge Hedjaz railway, and here use was made of three small Drevry trolleys normally used f 01 line inspection purposes. They v/ere unarmoured one-piece vehicles, peorol driven and with gear arrangements v/hich enabled them oc ^un ecualDy ^ we in either direction. During the interval while the new Ford chassis v/ere awaited improvised engine-and-armoured-truck patrols v/ere irm i u e to give some form of protection from close-range rifle flro f whic „ was specially intense on the Jerusalem-Lydda line where tne railway ran or a long v/ay through deep gorges. On the steep climb up to Jeru^a em, the grades and curves were too much for the armoured tiolleys, an 1 was inadvisable to run pilot trolleys which had no overhead cover. Improvised armoured fighting trucks v/ere therefore attached to pa^oenger trains in this section. In addition to the railway vehicles described in Appendix XI two armoured trains were also fitted out and manned by naval personne • They suffered from the usual drawbacks of armoured trains, an Ju0r it was soon found that the opposition encountered was never enoug o44816-1 82 justify the concentration of so much fire power in one unit. They were also very vulnerable to a well-placed mine and, since their derail ment would have caused serious dislocation to traffic, it was usually necessary to allot a pilot trolly to precede them. On the whole there is little doubt that the armoured train in Palestine was entirely uneco nomical as a means of railv/ay protection. Armoured Train No. 1 (stand ard gauge) was commissioned at Haifa on the 10th July and consisted of a locomotive, three open trucks and a decoy passenger truck: it carried a 10-inch naval searchlight and a generator and was armed with two 2-pr. pom-poms from H.M.S. 'Delhi' and two Vickers and eight Lewis guns from H.M.S. 'Arethusa . ' The sides of the trucks were armoured with steel plating backed with protective mattresses, and the crew consisted of an officer, a gunner and 31 ratings drawn from 'Arethusa' and ' Durban 1 *. The train was operated on two occasions between Haifa and Jerusalem but was never in action against the rebels, and was dismantled a month or two later. Armoured Train No.2 (narrow gauge) was commissioned by H.M.S. 'Sussex' on the 3rd August, and performed useful service in night patrol ling of the narrow gauge Hedjaz railway between Haifa and Samakh. It was armed with one pom-pom and searchlight, two Maxims and six Lewis guns. Later this train was taken over by H.M.S. ' Valiant ' and its composition altered as follows, trucks being shown in the order of running: one enpty ballast truck (as protection against mines), one truck with 18-inch searchlight and generator protected by Lewis guns, the locomotive, and a pom-pom truck also carrying Lewis guns. The train was controlled from the fore end of the searchlight truck where a system of bells passed orders to the driver and alarms to the pom-pom crew. SERVICE M.T. VEHICJESS purposes were the 15- The Morris had three main disadvantages:- (3) The exhaust was far too noisy. crossing road trenches been added to the to the equipment of each truck.44816-1 83 GUNS -AND AiavIUNITION Dragon-drawn 4.5-in. and 3.7-in. Howitzers were both employed in Palestine, but to such a limited extent that the efficiency of the equip ments for the task in hand was never really put to the test. For the most part the infantry mortar, being far more easily transported on hill tracks, filled the normal role of the field artillery. There was little demand for smoke and normally H. E. only was carried in the field. Other guns in use were the naval 2-pr. pom-pom and the 3-pr. Q F mounted in either lorries or railway trucks, and both gave good service. The pom-pom fired 200 rounds per minute against the 20 rounds per minute of the 3-pr., thus producing enough fire power to enable a wide area to be 'searched” in a very short time. The moral effect of this high rate of fire was very great, and it was particularly valuable at night. On the other hand the pom-pom required expert maintenance and constant attention while the 3—pr, had only four 'working parts and was easy to maintain. In addition the life of the pom-pom was 5000 rounds - and a good deal less if high rates of fire were continued - so that considerable economy had to be exercised in ios Uoe. The pom-pom fired either a time-fuzed powder- filled (C.N.F.) shell or an inpact-fuzed H.E. shell, while the 3-pn was supplied with similar shells though both were impact fuzed. There 'was a certain risk of prematures with the time-fuzed C.N.F. shell which made it dangerous to fire over troops and necessitated a minimum fuze-setting of 1000 yards. On the whole the impact-fuzed H.E. shell proved preferable owing to its greater destructive power in rocky country, the easier ob servation of its bursts, and the elimination of fuze-setting. MORTARS AND AMMUNITION The infantry mortar proved extremely valuable and was undoubtedly one of the successes of the operations. Its ease of transportation, its high moral effect - especially when used in conjunction with machine guns - and its remarkable accuracy made it an excellent v/eapon. Furthermore its simplicity enabled detachments to be trained very rapidly, an import ant point in Palestine where few battalions had ever seen a mortar before. It was never in action during wet weather, so that the effects of damp ground and atmosphere were never gauged. On rocky ground, where the base plate cannot be well dug in and where the spikes are easily damaged, some difficulties were encountered at the longer ranges since the base plate was inclined to slip back and make extensive adjustments necessary after each round. To counteract this some sandbags are desirable, but in their absence small pieces of rock should be packed under the base plate to act as a cushion. For transit by U T. a wooden frame to carry the mortar and its com ponents in one load which can be readily lifted by four men not only facilitates coming into action quickly but is also necessary to prevent damage in transit. This must not of course be confused with the fixed mounting described in Appendix X which is for a mortar intended to fire from the truck. Some night-firing equipment was found to be needed, and the spare parts bag proved to be inadequate: the webbing of the latter was too easily torn after a few weeks’ hard wear, and a leather bag would have been preferable. On several occasions the mortar was manhandled cross-country for distances up to fifteen kilometers, and it was found that the detachments were able to keep up with rifle companies over any type of country. The loads are, however, heavy and likely to lead to exhaustion on a hot day: for this reason donkeys were used wherever pos sible and detachments were always double-banked for carries of over one kilometre. About 5 % of the bombs fired failed to explode, due, so far as could Ue ascertained, either to defective ammunition or to the bomb landing on its side. Remains of some exploded bombs showed that about one third44816-1 84 of the bomb splintered while the remaining two-thirds conplete with pin were found intact. Again smoke was little used. It would have been of considerable value, especially for use in picquets, _ had some form of parachute flare been available which could have been fired from a mortar and which would have burnt longer than a Verey light. AUTOMATIC WEAPONS Vickers G-uns Five belt boxes per gun were usually carried in the field, but it was possible to dispense with the condenser can cind tube and the indirect fire equipment, since either prolonged or indirect fire was oeHcm employed. The spare parts box and picks and shovels were also left behind to reduce loads. Lewis Guns The need was felt very much of some form of synchronised light for night firing from guns mounted on lorries. This applied equally well to Lewis guns on tanks and armoured cars, and several expedients were tried. The most successful was that described in Appendix XII and illustrated in photographs Nos. 42 to 46, which was devised as a result of experiments carried out by the 3rd Bn. Coldstream Guards and later issued by the R.A.O.C. on a scale of 4 per battalion. GRENADES Rifle grenades proved most effective both from a moral and physical point of view against rebels firing from the cover of rocks or from houses. Infantry units usually employed one rifle bomber per platoon headquarters, while hand and rifle grenades were used frequently by the crews of armoured cars and railway trucks. It would have been extremely useful had it been possible to increase the range of rifle grenades, since fire up to 600 yards v/as sometimes required. TRACER AMMUNITION Tracer bullets of the type supplied for use by aircraft were employed by the R.A.F. armoured cars in the early stages and were most valuable in directing fire against road ambushes and snipers at night. Later their use was prohibited by the home authorities on humanitarian grounds. TEAR GAS The Palestine Police were authorised and trained to use tear gas, but conditions in Palestine gave little chance for its effective use. It was not held or employed by troops. On one occasion the aid of the police tear gas squad was invoked to assist troops in the capture of two armed men 'who had taken refuge in a well which led into an underground cave, so deep that hand grenades had had no effect. The gas failed to overcome the Arabs owing to difficult draughts, and in the end charges of gelignite had to be employed to put them out of action* The principal lessons regarding tear gas were that it was by no means as effective in this type of operation as might be thought at first, and that its use is a matter of considerable skill and must be left to trained detachments. The latter should be police and not troops.44816-1 85 SIGNAL LIGHTS Extensive use was made of signal lights both by day and by night, and it was found necessary to have one Verey pistol at least to each platoon. The issue of a special haversack to carry the pistol and lights, with separate compartments for different coloured lights, would have been useful. The Verey pistol issued to the Army was inadequate in several ways, the wider-bore pistol used by the R.A.F. being definite ly superior. Better still would have been flares - as used in the Great War - for indicating the position of troops to aircraft; and a form of parachute flare v/hich could be fired from a rifle or mortar for illumina tion purposes at night. SEARCHLIGHTS There was a definite need of some sort of light mobile searchlights which could fulfil a number of duties. Night patrols on the roads, railways, and pipe-lines needed them; they were required for canp defence and as a deterrent against snipers; were a valuable adjunct to tanks and armoured cars; and would have been useful in picquets; while even their use for signal purposes was by no means negligible. Since none existed in the army a number were improvised in various ways which are described below. Briefly they consisted of commercial motor-car spot lights and R.A.F. aerodrome lights on stationary mountings, and of naval searchlights and R.F. Anti-Aircraft searchlights mounted in lorries. As a result of these experiments it is possible to evolve some sort of rough specification on the following lines:- Mobile Searchlight Unit (a) A single light of limited range mounted (permanently if necessary) in a light fast vehicle with a fair cross-country per formance, such as the Morris 15-cwt. truck or Ford V8 pick-up. (b) Not necessarily required to work on the move, though this would have its advantages. (c) Capable of running for short periods off the engine of the vehicle. This is an important point especially when used with patrols, since the delay and noise attending the starting-up oi ohe generator motor often’ gave the enemy time to take cover. (d) Some simple form of remote control which will enable the operator to kneel or lie or at least not have to stand inmedia e y beside the light. Some light armour protection should be aaded if possible. ' In spite of this it is worthy of note that few if any casualties occurred to operators when working lights, nor were lights put out of action by enemy fire. This was probably clue to the fact that the enemy remained under cover whilst a searchlight was burning. The moral effect of the lights upon rebels in Palestine was most marked, and often the presence of a light alone was sufficien ° interference by saboteurs or snipers, who undoubtedly cr 5J lue * w ^ with far greater powers than the 3 r actually possessed. '' 1 ' aircraft lights the flight of bullets fired down the beam coulr e followed for some 600 yards, and gave very much the effeco o^ tra ammunition. The naval searchlights consisted of 18-inch projectois mounted i railway trucks, and 10-inch signalling projectors mounted in lorries lor use with pom-poms. The former were satisfactory, But then genera44816-1 86 were too heavy to mount in a lorry. The 10-inch projectors were run off portable generators mounted in the same vehicles, but their beam, being designed for signalling purposes, v/as too narrow except as a means of enabling the pom-pom gunner to pick up his target. The^beam was of no use as a means of spotting, and the light was Uoually switched off when the pom-pom v/as firing. Towards the end of July a company of the 1st A.A. Bn. R.B. arrived in Palestine, and their lights were used with great success in the new role of horizontal rather than vertical illumination. ine organization and employment of the company for this purpose is described in the follow ing chapter. For ground purposes the effective beam of the light was found to be as far as 8 to 10 miles, and it v/as possible to expose for periods up to 45 minutes without overheating the lorry engine v/hich generated” the light. At first the lights were dismounted and used in the same manner as for anti-aircraft purposes, though naturally v/ithout the sound locator detachments, but later alterations were made v/hich enabled them to be operated from the lorries without off-loading projec tors. This proved to be a great asset since the 'mobile' light could expose from a number of different points during the night, thereby en abling it to co-operate well v/ith moving troops and, by keeping the enemy constantly on the qui-vive , afforded at the same time added pro tection to the light and its crew. Although it could not operate on the move, it was only the matter of a few seconds before the light could be exposed after halting. Certain modifications in procedure required when running searchlights stripped as 'mobile units' are given in Appendix XIII. Wireless SIGNAL EQUIPMENT No. 1 sets had inadequate range, since up to 20 miles v/as found to be required. Fairly reliable results up to this range could only be obtained by substituting an open wire aerial adjusted to wave length, which v/as slov/er to erect. By substituting 8-cv/t. trucks for the Morris tv/o-seaters, overloading of the vehicles was avoided and enough room was available for operating the sets and carrying the technical and personal equipment. oome means of carrying the set in pack was found to be essential, and suitable gear was devised which could be made v/ithin the unit. Samples of this are shown in photographs No. 18 to 23.

One set was required per platoon headquarters, and in a country abounding in stones it was preferable to issue strips to infantry units without the lead weights with which they are normally fitted. This also of course results in a ver 3 &gt;- considerable saving in cost as well as weight where large numbers are required. DRESS AM) PERSONAL EQUIPMENT Dress generally 'Shirtsleeves' were worn throughout and jackets were never used, though it was usually necessary to have cardigans available for nightwork in the hills even in the middle of summer. Shorts were usually worn but many units preferred khaki drill trousers: shorts were of course cooler and more comfortable but gave no protection against mosquitos and were not so good as trousers for lying or kneeling on stones and scrub. Trousers also could be worn without puttees leaving the calves of the leg free for climbing work in the hills. A good compromise would have been shorts with turn-down extensions such as issued in Salonika in the Great War, worn with stockings and ankle puttees which were always preferable to the ordinary puttees for hill work. Headdress Topees were the normal wear, and the use of steel helmets was mostly confined to the towns and to men working on trains. In hot weather in the open steel helmets became very hot and v/ere too heavy, but they prob ably gave some protection against some of the inefficient home-made ammunition of the Arabs when fired at long range. Though vulnerable to normal S.A. fire, steel helmets had a certain value to all personnel travelling in vehicles who did not expect to have to operate far from their transport: they had a definite moral effect and gave some protection against stones and splinters, and on more than one occasion v/ere undoubted ly the means of saving lives in road accidents. A very important point regarding headdress was some sort of uniformity which would help pilots of aircraft to recognise troops, especially as many of the rebels took to wearing topees v/hich could readily be bought; and for this reason there were occasions where the steel helmet or S.D. cap had its advantages. Incidentally it is v/orth noting that topees are quite unknown among the British civilian community of Palestine and might well have been dispensed with by the troops had something in the nature of the Australian wide awake' been available, which v/ould have been suitable for both day and night wear and v/ould have been more distinctive and more comfortable than the Wolseley helmet. Footgear Nailed boots were suited neither to paved streets nor rocky hillsides, v/hile the rubber-soled 'P. T.' shoes could not stand up to the hard wear required. For this sort of work in Palestine the replacement of one pair of the ordinaiy marching boots by something equally substantial,^ but with a rubber or rope sole, v/ould have been advantageouo. _ wor led to very heavy wear on boots, shorts and other articles of clothing and, if peace-time accounting is to be retained, an increase in c o ng allowance is justified and in 1936 it was eventually authorise .44816-1 88 Equipment All units were constantly striving to reduce weighs in the field and this led to many experiments. Some avoided web equipment altogether by carrying ammunition in cotton bandoliers, but deficiencies in the bandolier usually compelled a return to web pouches. A leather bandolier of the mounted type or an improved pattern of coy -on bandolier, worn with a belt to carry the bayonet, would have been- an improvement on the normal web equipment. The sling of the cotton bandolier^ was neither strong enough nor sufficiently firmly sewn on, and the bosoms ol the pockets were too easily worn by the ends of the rounds. oO rounds S.A.A. per man was the amount usually carried. The pack was often worn as a rucksack and was conveniently carried this way in the hills: the water bottle was packed inside it, and the usual contents for lengthy operations included a mug 01 mess —tin, Knife, fork, spoon, rations for 24 hours plus an emergency ration, first field dressing and a cardigan. Some units - notably R.A.S.C. - had no bayonets. 'The bayonet was a handy weapon to carry when walking-out, 'was required for guard duties, and on some occasions was used in hand-to-hand melees during night operations. It was found to interfere with M.T. drivers using a central gear change, and it was better to remove all equipment except belt and pouches while driving. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT The standard medical equipment of units was packed in a way suitable to infantry on the march, but inconvenient for operations where motor transport was widely used and battalions were distributed over a large area. It was often necessary to re-pack medical stores to equip out lying detachments, and it would have been better had such stores been made up into quantities sufficient for 150 to 200 men and allotted accordingly. In addition most detachments, such as picquets, required morphia and shell-dressings. One stretcher 'was a useful accessory to every M. T. vehicle which carried ten or more men. RATIONS The food containers and petrol cookers carried in some M. T. vehicles were invaluable. For the rationing of small posts it would have been a considerable advantage had such things as milk, jam,etc. been issued in g-lb. and not 1-lb. tins. 3?o save transport such posts were usually rationed every two days, one day's fresh and one day’s tin ned meat being issued plus two days’ vegetables and groceries. Water was often carried in four-gallon petrol tins, which usually needed some form of improvised numnah covering to keep the contents cool.44816-1 89 CHAPTER 11 THE S lPLOY]:CE 7 T OF THE VARIOUS ARMS So prominent was the part played by aircraft in every phase of the operations that it will be more convenient to consider its employment in detail in a separate chapter. It is the intention in this chapter to show what units of the various arms of the three Services viere available in Palestine, how each was organized, the tasks upon which they were employed, and their suitability or otherwise to carry out those tasks. TANKS The only unit of the Royal Tank Corps represented v/as 'C' Company of the 6th Battalion, equipped with eighteen Mark III Light Tanks. On arrival the Company was organised as a Coy. KQ. with three tanks, and five Sections each of three tanks. Two sections were detached from the start and remained separated from the rest of the Company by distances varying from 35 to 82 miles. The remaining three sections were fre quently dispersed over the Tulkarm-Jenin-Nablus triangle at distances from 10 to 20 miles from Coy. HQ., which remained for most of the time at Tulkarm. Only on one occasion - for the three days of Operation M X' - was the whole Company ever concentrated in one area. Every effort was made from the beginning to avoid this wide dispersion but circumstances inevitably demanded it, with the natural result that difficulties arose in relation to personnel, repair staff, M.T. vehicles and spares. It was certainly shown beyond doubt that the organization of the Company as a self-accounting unit on the lines of the Light Tank Companies in India would have simplified its administration enormously, especially as there was the added complication of having to account for all stores through a battalion headquarters miles away in Egypt. This reorganiza tion was eventually authorised as a result of strong representations, but authority arrived only after the operations were finished, so that its worth in the field was never tested. The dispersion of the Company made the supply of fitters, tools, spares and fitters’ lorries a difficult problem; though eased by the presence of an L.A.D. at Coy* HQ. and the fortunate establishment of an 0.M.17. within easy reach of the two permanently detached sections. On arrival the strength of the unit in other ranks was 67, ot which tank crews numbered 40: these numbers proved to be insufficient for the nature of the operations and later a further 20 reinforcements were added. At first it had been found very difficult to provide for suffi cient guard duties to ensure the safeguarding of arms and property, and after some weeks the problem of securing the men sufficient nighos in bed became acute. Under such conditions it is clearly necessary to have a good proportion of spare men in excess of tank crews, though experience showed that on the plains of Palestine the section of three tanks frequently represented more force than v/as required lor the immediate task. In the majority of actions therefore tanks operated in sub-sections of two in order to avoid unnecessary wear on personnel and machines. The nature of the tasks upon which tanks were employed may be summarised as follows a) Ground Reconnaissance This was either with a view to future tank operations or, more often, to find practicable routes for other arms. In the hills44816-1 90 these reconnaisances were mostly carried oj^ at walking pace and were invariably accompanied by frequent breakages of tracks and pins and the shedding of tracks. Nevertheless the results ob tained were always of good value, and olten tanks proved to be the most economical medium for gaining the information. It was during such a reconnaissance thao an action toon place in tne Tulkarm area on the night of the 8/9oh October, whicn is described in full in Appendix XV as a lair sample o.i che tasks of tanks in these operations. b) Demonstration of force The moral effect of tanks for this purpose, either with or without accompanying motorised infantry made them particularly useful for 'showing the flag' both to overawe truculent Arab areas and to hearten isolated Jewish colonies. c) Searches and Drives Acting in conjunction with infantry and armoured cars, tanks were used in establishing cordons around villages or suspect areas. They were well suited for blocking exits, particularly those on the open flanks, and were also useful as advanced guard to the force in the approach march. d) Town and Village fighting A Force Order published on the 7th June prohibited the employment of tanks and armoured cars inside towns where serious opposition might be encountered. This was intended to guard against the obvious risk of getting trapped in narrow twisty streets, of which an incident at Gaza had provided a timely example. On the 24th May armoured cars travelling on the main road which passed through the town had suddenly been taken by surprise and found themselves blocked in. By the exercise of considerable resource they succeeded in getting onto the railway and fortunately ex tricated themselves by driving down the line; but in the mean while tanks from Sarafand had been despatched to their assistance. By the time they arrived the town of Gaza had been in the hands of o:ie mob for some hours, and eighteen road blocks consisting of large stones, furniture, telephone poles and girders had been constructed at the approaches: the few Europeans had been concentrated in the police station, where a small body of police and a weak platoon of infantry were practically hemmed in. One or two tank 'charges' effecuivexy cleared the main street of inhabitants and obstacles without firing a shot and quickly restored the situation. Later tne tanks demolished twenty-two more barricades when supporting clearing parties of infantry and police. During many subsequent operations in villages tanks were employed o c ear ne vvay through road blocks at the entrances, and some- a u ° e ^ u ^ mea rs of standing guard over arrested inhabitants. e) Patrols ti °^ wer ® sequent both by day and night and were some- to'oroteo^ipH 1 ^ ^ mo y orised - infantry. They were undertaken on the ro-d^ jC ° ? nies a £ a inst marauders, to counter ambushes for^the^oads' and C ^ilways^ t^l^ lines Vn-r ^ ' i e l e Phone lines and electric power going'was unsuitable 'VoXwheels? Patr ° ls Were in areas where th ®f) Striking Forces 44816-1 91 In the Nablus area tanks were usually included with other arms in the Striking Forces which were held at suitable centres to take immediate advantage of any chance encounters. g) Demolitions On occasions tanks were used as a quick and effective means of demolishing gimcrack buildings and Bedouin encampments under the eyes of the inhabitants. The moral effect was probably valuable, but a good deal of care was required to avoid damage to tank fittings. It was necessary to remove the sandguards; while lamps, turret grips and tools carried outside were liable to be torn off. There was also a risk of fire from inflammable material collecting on the top of the silencer. Tent fabric would cling to the tank blinding both the driver and the gunner, while broken guy ropes wound themselves round the tracks and suspension. The employment of tanks for demolition purposes is not, therefore, to be recommended where other means are availaole. h) As Guards As an alternative to an infantry machine gun post, the tank was often useful where speed in establishing a post was essential and where the country was inaccessible to N.T. Examples include anti-sniper ambush posts established after dark on high ground overlooking camps, guards on railway bridges at night, or on the scenes of train derailments. i) As a substitute for armoured cars Ydiere armoured cars were not available, tanks were used on occasion to escort convoys of M.T. or the cars of Commanders. Such employment was of course exceptional, since io mvo ^e heavy wear on tracks and suspension mechanism. j) As M armoured taxis 1 ' The employment of tanks on this duty was obviously uneconomical, but was sometimes justified in places where trie oco ^ t ® unamcured vehicles were easy prey to the gunman or close-range sniper. Tanks were less easily trapped than their moral effect on such occasions was by no means They were used in this way so enforce curier.s ^ u officers round their guards in particular j - personnel for the streets of Nablus - and even to carry technical personnel tor inspection of power lines in dangerous areas inaccessible —The following is an analysis of the employment of tanks on the various duties described above* Action witn tne enemy resulted in about 10/a of the tank 'sorties'.

The two tenders carried Lewis guns on Scarf e ring mountings, but they were unarmoured and as a rule accompanied the armoured cars by daylight only. For purposes of maintenance each section in turn was withdrawn into reserve at the base at Rami eh, where one half went out of action for maintenance while the other stood by as a R.A.F. reserve for special purposes such as assisting in the recovery or repair of stranded aircraft. The tactical unit of the 11th Hussars was the troop of three armoured cars. As in the case of the tank section, the troop was usually too strong for the task in hand and could not easily be divided into two sub-units. In practice therefore the 11th Hussars troop usually operated with two cars only while the necessary maintenance was being carried out on the third, thus avoiding any with drawal of complete units for mechanical reasons. Since all night moves of infantry M.T. columns, and many of the daylight convoys as well, required armoured car escorts it was imposs ible to avoid wide dispersion. In most cases the cars were split up into the smallest units and attached more or less permanently to infantry battalions. This naturally produced many drawbacks: it made adminis tration difficult, and gave regimental and even squadron and company commanders little opportunity of exercising their commands. On the other hand with armoured cars and tanks perhaps more than with any other arm it was essentially a 'subaltern's war', and the very close and effective co-operation which resulted between armoured cars and in fantry was in great measure due to the fact that the junior officer and his men lived with the infantry battalion with whom they were working. Armoured cars were employed upon most of the tasks v/hich have already been described as falling to the lot of the tanks. On the net- work of good main roads existing in Palestine they were faster and more silent than tanks, they were less susceptible to wear and tear and even on the rough tracks gave a creditable performance. On the other hand they were comparatively easy to ditch and trap and, being unsrmoured underneath, were vulnerable to mines. It was usually necessary for a truckload of infantry to accompany armoured caurs for the purpose of removing road blocks. The main tasks of cars may be summarised as under:- (a) Ilobile striking force - especially in co-operation with motorized infantry. (b) Patrolling main roads by day and night, (c) Escorting motorized infantry columns, civilian convoys, and naval pom-pom detachments, (d) Acting as mobile flank guards to prevent escape of rebels during the 'search' of an area or village, A great deal of the work of the armoured crus was at night, when unarmoured vehicles ran a grave danger of heavy casualties irom su^aen bursts of close range rifle fire from ambush. MOTOR CA VALRY Under this heading come the 8th Hussars with their Foi is^hnile the two Mechanized Infantry Companies of the Trans- Jordan^ronmer Force may conveniently be considered at the same time. ^.° 1Ca unit of the 8th Hussars was the Troop of four 15-cwt. Ford VS. Pick-ups and one 50-cwt. truck: each carried four men and mounted a44816-1 94 Yickers-Bertliier gun. Bh.e 30—cv; t • tmCK ca_rz'ied. 3up_- _ies and. spares in addition, and one of the pick-ups was fitted with T7/T. There were four troops to a squadron. Though the organization and equipment of the re inent had been designed primarily for the deserts oz Egypt, they proved very suitable for operations in the level country of the southern -part 0 -' F .destine where eonsideraole cross-country work was feasible. A larger establishment for a troop would however have been an advantage partiesilarly in cases where dismounted action '«as required; and later, after its return to Egypt, the regiment was re-organized in December 193 g into Squadrons of three Troops each, each Troop containing six pick-urs (one fitted with D/t) , while the 30-cwt. trucks were included in the ' Squadron H.Q. The Mechanized Company of the T.J.F.F. consisted of a Light Troon of three 'Armed Cars' and a heavy Troop of tnree 'Troop- Carriers', with a staff car, supply tender and — /F tender in the Company HQ. The 'Aimed Car' was a ly-ton Gammer with a Wickers gun on a fixed mounting and carried a crew of five, while the 'Troop Carrier' had the same chassis and armament but carried eleven men. Both vehicles held rations, water, petrol and oil for four days and had a circuit of action of 400 miles, but neither was as fast nor as mobile as the 8th Hussar Ford. None of the vehicles in either regiment were armoured. Host of the work of the 8th Hussars was in the semi-desert country lying between the Southern end of the Dead Sea -and Gaza, an area where their special characteristics could be best exploited. Being the only troops in the area, outside thd town of Gaza, they were called upon for a variety of duties the chief of which was the protection of road and rail caEmunicatians against sabotage. This was carried out by means of frequent and irregular mounted patrols - mostly at night - and achieved a fair degree of success. The regiment also conducted frequent searches of houses and villages in conjunction with the police. Outside the Gaza-Beersheca area units of the 8th Hussars assisted in the patrolling of electric power lines and pipe-lines, and during Operation 'Z' the whore regiment was employed upon cordon duties. In the latter case the cordon extended over a front of fifteen miles which gave little chance of real security being achieved: it is probable that two miles per squadron is the maximum effective frontage for this sort of work, particularly at night, and may even have to be reduced to one mile if determined attacks on the cordon are to be expected. _ne Sth nussars suffered severely from land mines, and no less than twelve cars were damaged by mines at night which had been buried just _emow one surtace of sandy tracks. The demolition of houses, which oried as a deterrent, failed to nave much effect: the best answer ,\ould probably have een the carriage of hostages, but that unfortunately ^.rohi^iteu. On one occasion only 7/ere the Sth Hussars employed on an offensive roxe in tne nills, and there is little doubt that their orgar_zaoion was not well suited to this sort of ground: without armour JJ '' e --ling cars .vere always very vulnerable to ambush, and the danger was greatly increased where narrow defiles had to be negotiated and ._ere w-rn no room -or cars to ee turned round. Mobility too was lost on tne mils, since movement was only possible along tracks, and Troops were :co weak on the ground to carry out effectively a long dismounted x^ac wevertheleos in spite of these drawbacks the 1st Division noticed a marked superiority in mobility -and enterprise of cavalry over .ruo ,a e equipped with vehicles with a similar p er~ anaance. . ...rt of p e T.v^.3'. mechanized units vras -or-actically confined klfkl j , e - ’ p® re co-operated T/ith the cavalry in pro se-lice ; P , . i •- a uro ^ J - ln &amp; *ne frontier.

It was, however, found impossible to accede to this request. The operations were of a type which gave many opportunities for the use of mounted troops against an opponent who has always had a wholesome dread of cold steel and a very high respect for a mounted man. Though much of the country was difficult for cavalry - and some of it almost impossible - there were wide areas where the horseman alone could hope to outstrip the enemy, and where the rebels themselves maintained mounted contingents. Whether the British Cavalry troop horse would have been able to stand up well enough to the continual stones and rocks of the Palestine hillsides may be open to question; and it would certainly have taken several months to obtain Arab horses of suitable type, even by drawing on all the neighbouring countries. As it was, horsed cavalry in Palestine was represented only by two squadrons of the T.J.P.P. based on their Jordan Valley peace stations. They were organized in half squadrons, each of some 80 strong, compris ing two sabre troops and a Hotchkiss gun section. Each squadron had one Commer supply tender, and a W/l tender was allotted as required. Their organization was well suited to the country, where the men were accustomed to living hard and cooking for themselves; but the need of a pack -wireless set per squadron was very keenly felt. The T.J.F.E. Cavalry, like the mechanised units, worked most of t*he time in the Jordan Valley guarding against incursions from over the border. The cavalry concentrated chiefly on the northern half of the Jordan, where tracks were rougher and less frequent. Liuch effective patrolling was carried out at night, and patrols were used to remaining out for three or four days away from their base. It was found that squadrons coiild carry out average daily marches of 25-30 miles without undue strain or loss of fighting power, and on one occasion a squadron marched 22 miles in six hours over rock-strewn hills without casualty. Movement was sometimes handicapped by shortage of facilities for water ing in the hills - particularly towards the end of summer - but if nec essary the Frontier Force troop horse could go long distances without water. On a peace march just after the end of the rebellion a half- squadron covered 60 miles in one day across waterless country: though horses were watered only a.t the start and end of the march there were no casualties. On some occasions, notably in tne difficult country^ ^ adjoining the Syrian frontier, cavalry were used^ successfully to ’’drive rebels on to waiting infantry. Other duties which fell to them were the patrolling of the oil pipe-line and protection of Jewish colonies in the Jordan Valley: neither task was well suited to mounted troops, since they gave little opportunity of making use of mobility, but were forced upon them by a shortage of infantry and the very bad climatic conditions of the Valley. Cavalry had the one supreme advantage in Palestine of being the^ only arm which could move quickly and silently off roads and traces in the hills. This they owed in great measure to the special characteris tics of the local Arab horse: on the worst rock mountain path it proved wonderfully agile and sure-footed, and though a number of sprung and loose shoes might result good feet and sturdy limos made ameness almost unknown. INFANTRY 24 24 Battalions in all saw service in Palestine during tne recellion. All were organized on the old establishment of three r i 6 compani and one support company, all had a proportion of M.^. ^ ^o e &gt; with four exceptions (Camerons, Loyals, Seaforth and r. Sco o ^,j44816-1 96 „ n „ -irotablishmeiit and in many oases sadly below even that level in actual strength. Since machine guns were seldom used in the mils except for pfcquets, most battalions organised their support companies on a riPe basis, retaining only one machine-gun platoon - .and the mortar platoon to cases where mortars had been issued. Two battalions. Cheshires and South ’Tales Borderers - were specially organised for railway protection work. A •problem in organisation which confronted nearly all battalions was how to create as many rifle platoons as possible out of a reduced strength. The more riflemen who could be icund the more oi ten were the men themselves enabled to spend 'nights m bed - a difficulty which was ever present in Palestine where innumerable gUo.rd duties uold heavily on all units. The usual practice was to ensure a minimum section strength of 1 N.C.O. and 6 men; allot one Lewis gun section and two rifle sections to a platoon, and three platoons -o a company. In addition the battalion H.Q. and band personnel were organized as riflemen and took their turn in the field with tne rest. •The tasks upon which infantry were employed were fai too many and varied to be described in detail. It is sufficient to ociy tiiao tnere v/ere never enough men to meet the countless demands lor defensive duties and at the same time to ensure that sufficient striking forces v/ere ready close at hand to hit hard at the enemy whenever he was located. It was very seldom that it 7/as possible to employ a battalion as a 7 /hole, and mostly it v/as a war oi small unis — more of ucn of platoons than of companies. The protection of communications alone demanded a high degree of dispersion, and this wide dispersion of infantry 7 /as perhaps one of tne most noticeable features oi the opera*' tions. In offensive work individual enterprise and ingenuity, a good knack for stalking and an ability to move rapidly across country v/ere the principal ingredients for successful infantry. Wide surrounding tactics and efficient night movements invariably paid well in results. The rates of advance in the hills 7/ere naturally very slow: small parties might do three kilometres an hour by day and two by nighm, out a company column with pack animals averaged some two kilos only by day and half that at night. In the first stages of Operation 'X' in very difficult country platoon columns, moving up wadi beds and searching caves and other cover en route, covered 8 to 10 kilometres in 6 to 7 hours - most of it under a hot sun. On another occasion tv/o battalions of the Southern Brigade 'driving' the very steep; hills flanicing the Jaffa - Jerusalem railway did 11 kilos in 8 hours. Some further examples of moves of well-seasoned infantry over familiar ground are shown in Appendix XVI. If infantry v/ere required to leave their k.T. and return to it the same day they could not be expected to move further than a radius of six to eight kilos, from a road. Cross country movement was invariably quickest when a track was followed, hov/ever circuitous it might seem, and it was noticeable that even Arabs found that it seldom paid to move away from a track by day and never by night. ARTILLERY The artillery units in Palestine consisted of the five naval pom pom detachments, the one 3-pr. detachment, one section of 3.7-in. Hows, and two bauteries of 4.5-in, Hows. The pom-poms and 3-pr. , mounted on lorries, operated singly and had no higher organization beyond the single gun detachment. The first section of 3.7-in. Hows, was furnished by H.k. b. 'S ussex ': they v/ere equipped for man-handling only and v/ere used lor some ten days in gun pits at Nablus as a counter-measure against snipers behind sangars. They v/ere replaced by a 3.7-ih. dragon*^ drawn section of R.H.A. in the middle of August. The tv/o field batteries; both with dragon-drawn 4.5-in. Hov/s. arrived late in the day and only one v/as ever used in action against the rebels.44816-1 97 © The employment of the pom-poms and 3-pr. may be summarised under the following headings (a) Fire support to striking forces Gun lorries afiorded projection against snipers while a force was moving by M.T., gave covering fire for infantry advances after de-bussing, denied certain ways of escape to the enemy with harrassing fire, and finally covered the withdrawal of the troops to their transport and their return by road, which was usually subjected to heavy sniping. In addition ’’searching' fire was employed against areas where enemy were believed to be lying up. It was found that a burst of five rounds was usually enough to 'bolt' any Arabs within some two hundred yards of the bursts, after which they could be taken on by machine-gunners. (b) Road protection Gun lorries, acting in conjunction with armoured cars, carried out many patrols both by day and night of roads where ambushing was frequent and where saboteurs were active. These resulted in a number of actions and undoubtedly accounted for many rebel casualties. The Arab, secure behind rocks in a well-protected position, would usually sit tight under rifle or even machine-gun fire but would always retire immediately shells started to fall in his vicinity. The guns thus not only had a strong moral effect, but were also the means of providing good targets for machine-gunners. ( c ) Protection of Convoys Gun lorries accompanied most of the convoys through the bad areas by day. By opening immediate and heavy fire upon any enemy loca ted on the route they soon succeeded in dispersing ambush parties and effectively silencing snipers. (d) In support of picque ts Gun lorries would escort picquets to the debussing point en route to their positions, and would then remain on the road to give covering fire if required until the picquets were in position. The howitzers, in addition to firing upon snipers overlooking the camps, were in action on several occasions in support of striking forces. It cannot be said that their employment was really justified: their moral value was undoubtedly high, and on one or two occasions their fire provided effective support when it was possible for them to co-operate with infantry from the neighbourhood of a road. But ^ generally the country was against them; the guns were less mobile both on and off the roads than the infantry whom they were supporting, and suitable targets were seldom presented. There is no douo'o that pack artillery, equipped with lorry transport for its mules, would have been far more useful; but even then it is doubtful whether under one circumstances the light howitzer would have had much more effect than the infantry mortar or the aircraft bomb. In Palestine both^were certainly of greater value than mechanised artillery, though it must be admitted that the latter had little time to adapt itself to loca conditions before the operations came to an end. The reasons for this failure of artillery - other than the latural lack of suitable targets - may be worth analysing.^ liost^oi bhem are attributable to the nature of the country. In tne^ place the dragons could not keep up with the lorries of the in an ry striking forces and thus required special escorts. wer ® very slow on twisty tarmac hill roads and were liable to SKid on the come. ,44816-1 98 and it was necessary to resort to the practice of towing guns on the road with 30-cwt. lorries while the dragons followed separately to be available for cross-country Y/ork when required. This system increased the speed, but even the lorry-drawn guns could not keep up v/ith the in fantry on hill roads. Once off the roads suitable gun positions could often be reached after careful reconnaissance, but serious communication difficulties were experienced. It was usually impossible to get the battery W/T vehicles forward to the observations posts, and telephone lines would have to be laid by hand over long distances. TThere visual was employed, one, tv/o, or even three relaying stations had at times to be provided, with the result that the transmission of fire orders and tactical messages was hopelessly slow for the fleeting nature of the target usually presented. Artillery, in common with other arms, also suffered from the difficulty of distinguishing between friend and foe among rocks and olive trees v/hich only too often restricted the area in which it was safe to fire. ENGINEERS Field Companies The first Royal Engineers unit to arrive in Palestine was the 42nd Field Company from Egypt, a mixed company that included a railway detachment. It was followed in the middle of June by the 2nd Field Company, which was relieved by the 17th Company in September. Three more field companies - 9th, 12th and 26th - also arrived in September, as well as the 6th Field Park Company which was retained at the base at Haifa. The Field Companies suffered throughout from a shortage of men, and it would seem that at anything less than full war establishment the Field Company is not an economical unit. It was usually necessary during these operations to provide a detachment of sappers to each infantry brigade headquarters, and this dispersion reduced further still the numbers actually available for work. As a result, many reconnaissances vdiich would normally have required an officer had to be undertaken by h.C.O’s, while working parties v/hich in war would have been under an N.C.O. were often in the charge of a Sapper. There is li ttle doubt that one or two Field Companies at war strength would have produced a greater output of Y/ork than several smaller units totalling tne same numbers. It is most desirable that the motor transport allotted to R.E. units should be at least as fast as that allotted to tLe tx ^try: on the hill roads of Palestine the Field Coinpanies were much delayed by 30-cwt. lorries towing heavy trailers. xhe duties Ox the Field Companies may be summarised as under :- (a) Clearing Communications Forties of sappers, up to a dozen strong, would either accompany x-.x. columns or stand by at suitable centres to assist in the removal of obstructions on the roads and railv/ays, v/hich frequently included mines or 'booby traps', and to effect the necessary repairs to oridges e^c. Attention to enemy booby traus proved to be^a frequent duty, and without R.E. assistance there would certain g «.\e been many more casualties from this particular menace. ■ L (b) Protection of Communications Much passive protection of bridges, culverts, waterpipe valves &amp; etc. ,/as afforded by the laying of booby traps by Royal and ^, iese traps were responsible for inflicting a b 01 CaSualt ies on the rebels. The booby trap system proved44816-1 99 a good means of economising in troops for purely defensive duties, but it must be admitted that the Arabs were not highly skilled at demolitions - although never short of explosives and men accustomed to using them - and hesitated to do serious damage to such things as water supplies for fear of suffering themselves from the con sequent shortages. It was probably for these reasons that one Field Company was often able to serve two infantry brigades without undue strain, but had the enemy shown a little more skill and enterprise an allotment of engineer units in the normal proportion for a Field Army would not have been excessive. (c) Punitive Demolition This duty became more and more frequent as the rebellion went on and as more intensive measures of repression were authorised. Demolitions varied from that of a single house in a ramshackle village to those on an extensive scale - such as at Jaffa - in volving well-built substantial houses. Demolitions were also sometimes necessary for tactical purposes such as clearing a field of fire near a vulnerable point, but for the most part were more punitive in nature. When village search operations were under taken which might involve demolitions it was usual for a detach ment of sarjpers to travel in the centre of the column during the approach march with explosives carried in a special bullet-proof lorry. A form of 'demolition drill' which proved useful is des cribed in Appendix XVII. (d) Field Defences This task usually took the form of assisting infantry in the con struction of picquets and camp defences. (e; Accommodation The arrival of the Emergency Force necessitated the diversion of the greater portion of the engineers from tactical duties to ohe preparation of camp structures and camp water supplies. Later, on the conclusion of the rebellion, all Engineer units were enployed on the construction of temporary hutments in order ^o get uroops under cover before the winter broke. Railway Companies Unfortunately the 8th Railway Company did not reach Palestine until the end of the rebellion, but the railway section of the 42nd Field Company, aided by a number of naval ratings, was employed upon the railways for most of the summer. The chief duty was to learn the ^ system with a view to operating it in the event of wholesale desertion of the Arab employees, a contingency which fortunately was aver oed. ^ Railway tasks which were performed by the Royal Engineers during this period consisted of (a) Supplementing drivers and crews oi the R.ii.A. roid railway trolley patrols. (b) Providing locomotive crews for military patrol trains and light armoured trains. (c) Hanning the pilot trolleys for fast passenger trains and certain goods trains. (d) Providing locomotive crews and brakesmen on certain essential night goods services where the frequency 01 sabotage cuP oniping precluded the use of civilian crews - particularly on tne Jerusa em Tel Aviv line.44816-.1 100 (e) Providing platelayer look-outs- on certain patrol trains and railcars to deal with cases of sabotage, mines and etc. (f) Work on the clearance of train wrecks. (g) Providing passenger train escorts, which afforded good opportunities of studying the operation of the railway. Searchlight Companies One of these units was available for the second half of the rebellion in the unfamiliar role of illuminating the ground rather than the sky. This was 'A” Company of the 1st. Anti-Aircraft Battalion. The Company was divided into self-contained single light detachments of one N.C.O. and four men each - since sound-locator numbers were not required - and widely dispersed almost literally 'from Dan to Beersheba'. Later when the Company devised a method of burning lights without off-loading projectors from the lorries, the detachments were used in the role of mobile units moving their base of operations frequently with a view to achieving the maximum surprise. Although each searchlight detach ment was armed with rifles and a Lewis gun, an infantry escort for the light was always necessary, and each detachment was placed under the orders of the infantry or cavalry unit to which it was allotted and which assumed responsibility for the tactical employment and protection of the light. Fixed lights were employed for the illumination of certain vulner able areas where sabotage was frequent, such as the installations at the source of the Jerusalem water supply and certain important railway areas; and also as a counter-measure against snipers operating against such favourable targets as Nablus camp or the town of Jerusalem. The roving detachments ot mobile lights performed valuable work in patrolling the railway and the oil pipe-line where suitable roads existed in the vicinity. t * searchlight was undoubtedly far too powerful and not sufficiently mobile for the tasks it was required to perform in Palestine, but nevertheless it proved to be an excellent deterrent against saboteurs and snipers and did much to enable economies to be effected in the troops employed upon purely defensive duties at night, •/.oreovei it was often able to give good assistance to infantry picquets and patrols operating against rebels at night. After a little experi ence in on try made good use of the lights by working up unseen under cover of the beam, which alone had a very demoralising effect on the enemy. Under good conditions the range of the beam was from 8 to 10 ml an eie no question that the Arab credited it with even greater powers, so that on some of the long straight stretches of raii- or •^ 1 ^ )C ' lne a san £^- e searchlight would effectively prevent inter- eience over u length of some 20 miles without the employment of any • °r n ff t]aan lts own small escort. Few Arabs ever dared to move • n G , J ; Sho . ° f the beain &gt; even at long range, and the fact that there to the morallffect? ° f S bei “ 8 hit by fire is a S ood testimonial SIGNALS inn with ' . operations is the necessity of incluc not “,il the ( lT P* 3 l n ° mal Wrtion of signal units.

Signals fron ^ v ' aS not imtl1 the Emergency Force came from England thai44816-1 101 the Army had its proper complement of signals. The unsuitability of their organization has been discussed in detail in a previous chapter. The bulk of the work fell upon the infantry brigade sections which had never sufficient personnel or equipment for maintaining communica tions in the large areas over which their brigades were spread. A brigade section had sometimes to provide for an area headquarters and an operational headquarters in the field with four or more mobile units working under its control: it had therefore two tasks to perform each one of which was practically equivalent to what it would normally have to undertake in war. Fortunately this type of operations made few calls on Divisional Signals, Y/hich could safely be drawn upon to supple ment Brigade Sections. The solution therefore appeared to be to utilize the Divisional Signals for area work and to leave the Brigade Sections free for their more normal functions. This redistribution of duties vrould have been facilitated had-a signal park been available upon which the Divisional ..Signals could draw as required. AIRCPAFT The following chapter is devoted to the work of aircraft in co operation with troops in the field in Palestine. It is therefore only necessary here to record the units which were available, and certain general points regarding the organization of air co-operation. For the first five v/eeks of the rebellion the only aircraft operating in Palestine v/ero those of the flight of No.6 (Bomber) Squadron at Ramleh and two aircraft of No.14 (Bomber) Squadron detached to Jisr A1 Majami at the disposal of the O.G. Jordan Area, though the remainder of 14 Squadron from Amman carried^ out constant reconnaissances of the Jordan Valley and the approaches to it from Trans-Jordan. By the end of May the rest of No.6 Squadron, which was normally l 11 ^' 01 - ,l in Egypt for convenience of accommodation, moved up into Palestine, and was followed in July by No. 33 (Bomber) Squadron. No. 203 (Army Co-operation) Squadron, which arrived in September, completed the Air Contingent; -while No.14 Squadron continued throughout to deal with Trans-Jordan and contribute aircraft as required for operating m the neighbourhood of the Jordan Valley. In the allotment of aixorart a fair measure of decentralisation was plainly demanded to ensure that immediate air action took plac whenever contact 'was made with the enemy and to provi e ... possible co-operation between air and land toices. i addition each Force was therefore distributed on a sons basis, *ip^f^hts ?or of the principal military' areas had a call upon allotted flights for reconnaissance duties and close co-operation with troops.

Both were facilitated by a liberal lay-out of landing grounds throughout the country. i n -the transmission of information the single Air Liaison Section at Ramleh was of great assistance, but experience showed that squadrons required a better supply of up-to-date information on the general situation. This can best be effected by including in the intelligence distribution list of each Brigade those R.A.F. Stations with which the Brigade is working The work of co-operating with troops had reached such a very high stand ard in the flight of No. 6 (Bomber) Squadron permanently stationed in Palestine that it was not always remembered that bomber squadrons employed upon such duties usually require, more detailed information and instructions from the army than do the Army Co-operation Squadrons. CO-OPERATION BY THE ROYAL NAVY Throughout the whole of the rebellion various ships of the Royal Navy were stationed at Haifa, and naval personnel co-operated actively with the Army and the Royal Air Force in many different ways both on land and sea. Command of the naval forces was exercised by the Senior Naval Officer at Haifa, acting under the orders of the C-in-C, Mediterranean. For operational purposes in Palestine the former was responsible to the High Commissioner and not to the A.O.C. - or later G.O.C. - British Forces. Up to the 22nd September the Rear-Admiral, 3rd Cruiser Squadron, was the S.N.O. at Haifa, being relieved on that date by the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. ' Valiant '. The work of the Royal Navy has been described in detail in Appendix 5 of Air Vice- Marshal Peirse's Despatch, and most of it is discussed under the appro priate ^ headings in various parts of this book. It may however be convenient here to summarise briefly the forms which it took. (a) ihe provision and manning of the gun and searchlight lorries, tne two armoured trains, and the two 3:7-in. howitzers at Nablus, all ox which have already been referred to. (b) The strengthening of the Customs Guards at Haifa by naval ratings and the^manning of a Customs patrol boat in the harbour i or the prevention of arms smuggling.

At one time destroyers were even required to deal with attempts by Arab lighter-men from Jaffa to attack ships entering the new port of Tel Aviv. Prior to this more than one steamer had been greeted with shots and bombs from boatloads of Arabs on approaching the Tel Aviv jetty. (g) Finally many naval stores were lent to the army - among them being 20,000 sandbags, seven portable wireless sets, and numerous protective mattresses for fitting to the railway trolleys; while a naval searchlight was fitted to the roof of Lydda Station. This brief list will suffice to point one clear lesson of the operations - the very valuable and varied assistance which the Navy can lend to the other services on such occasions.44816-1 104 CHAPTER 12 THE EHPLOTKEMT OF AIRCRAFT IN CO-OPERATION WITH TROOPS INTRODUCTORY Once the armed band had made its appearance, there were few engage ments in which aircraft and troops did not work together in very close co-operation - so close in fact that 'combined action' is probably a better description. Practically every case of a successful attack on armed rebels resulted from the combined efforts of air and land forces; and in most of the bigger actions - and many of the smaller ones too - the air arm provided the commander with his principal weapon of offence. Local conditions of Ground and Policy combined to make it an especially effective weapon in Palestine. It has been shown already how the armed bands had always to be met on their own ground, which would usually be in difficult mountain districts where the mobility of all land forces was reduced to the minimum and where aircraft alone could operate with out this serious handicap. Policy too, being dictated by civil and not purely military needs, restricted the employment of land forces on offensive duties. Policy required that the life of the country in its widest sense should be protected, and since this was naturally more a task for the man on the ground the greater part of the land forces was only too often committed to it. So that when it came to striking at the enemy in the hills it was usually upon the bombs and guns of his aircraft that the commander would rely for a concentration of force at the decisive point. The fact that in some months more than 50 /j of enemy casualties resulted from air action bears witness to their effect. As often as not it would be the troops who would find the enemy, they too would do their part in the striking, and to them would fall the task of the pursuit and 'clearing-up' which completed a successful action. But it was the offensive value of aircraft working with troops under the conditions which prevailed which provided one of the chief lessons oi the operations. For this reason it is proposed to deal in some detail with their employment on these duties. The chapter has been arranged to show first the difficulties which confronted the airmen and their methods of overcoming them, then the various means adopted to secure the closest co-operation with the troops, and lastly the ways in which that co-operation worked out in practice. AIR TACTICS Topography and Policy affected the tactics of aircraft almost as mucin as they did tne strategy of the forces in general. The airman had to find his enemy in precipitous country where cover from rocks and olive grovoo abounded, had then to identify him - amid a million similarly- clad inhabitants - as a rebel engaged in nefarious activity, and finally haa to engage^him in strict accordance with a precise and complicated set of rules dictated by Policy and varied with bewildering frequency. Ada uo all this the natural difficulties of flying - and especially low- -lymg - amid mountains, and the constant hazard of surprisingly effec' five rule-fire, and it will be appreciated that the task of the airman m Palestine was far from being an easy one. l ne ^ ie country and the necessity for careful indenti- fication made low flying imperative, and experience showed that 500 feet was tne maximum height for reconnoitring aircraft to fly if useful results were to be obtained. Such conditions naturally exposed aircraft toserious risks from rifle fire which was frequently intense, and many aircraft were hit. The risk was all the greater if fire could be opened before the enemy had been located and when the aircraft was flying at cruising speed low down. The cover afforded by olive groves and scrub gave the rebels a good chance of achieving this surprise. The tactics adopted to minimise the effect of such measures consisted of flying at a high speed in suspected areas when below 500 feet and delivering a bomb attack immediately hostile riflemen were located v/ith a view to breaking their resistance from'the start. The performance of the Hart type of aircraft enabled these tactics to be carried out with success in the hill country. In such districts the tendency to employ too many aircraft at one time had to be carefully resisted: if more than two aircraft were engaged the attention of the pilots was distracted by the necessity of keeping a close look-out to avoid collision, and this added to the difficulties of locating the enemy while flying low along wadis . The difficulty was great enough already, since the Arab credited the airman with an all-seeing eye and only too often tended to go to ground the moment an aeroplane appeared overhead. The restrictions imposed upon the use of aircraft weapons added still further to the difficulties already presented by the nature of the operations. It was not until the rebellion was more than two months old that the use of bombs was authorised. Even then it was confined to the 20-lb bomb within certain defined areas and under certain speci fied conditions only, while any bombing within 500 yards of the 'out skirts of a town, or a village or a building' was prohibited. As time went on negotiations with the civil authorities were successful in securing a gradual extension of the bombing areas, but for some time all requests for authority to use heavier bombs or to bomb buildings from which fire was being directed met with steady refusal. As the rebels later tended to fire from stone sangars or from the outskirts of villages, these restrictions imposed a very serious handicap upon air action. It was not until three aircraft had been shot down in one day under such conditions that in September the very limited use of the 112-lb bomb was authorised, but no bombing of buildings - even after their evacuation - was at any time permitted. Machine-gun fire from aircraft was normally allowed to be used against aimed rebels in _the open, but it was not until the last weeks of the rebellion that per mission was received to fire upon houses from which rebel file was being directed. The method of attack normally used by aircraft was evolved to suit these special conditions. To obtain the maximum effect bo mac me gun and bomb attack had to be delivered at a low altitude where the enemy was clearly visible, and the dive method was employe . e attack was made at high speed and the bombs released a ee ° below. If the first attack dispersed the enemy they were then picked off with the front gun, while if they retained cohesion a second bomb machine-gun dive attack was delivered which usually drove _ cover. They were then bolted from cover with the om ^ ^ by the front gun. Against armed men in sangars, thick oil S caves the 112-lb bomb with a 12-second delay action tail fuze p be the best weapon. Night operations by aircraft were limited to flights in Area connected with the protection of Jems h oolonies ‘ In the aircraft and the dropping of parachute f f 1-6 ® ^ 00n .

(b) Speedy communication with the Royal Air Force from the great est possible number of Army detachments. (c) A constant supply of up-to-date military information to R.A.F, Squadrons and detached Flights, and close liaison between commanders of troops and crews of aircraft. (d) Constant practice in working together. Organization of the Air Striking Force The R.A.F. suffered as badly as the Army from the difficulty of finding substantial targets at which it could strike. The armed band as a rule concentrated only for attack: in defence it was concerned chiefly in running away to live another day, it held no ground, it had no headquarters and no communications at which to strike, and it depended for its armour upon its elusiveness. The difficulty was increased by the dearth of information, which prevented pre-arranged attacks being made upon the bands and resulted in contact being gained mostly when the enemy himself chose to attack. The combined problem therefore was to concentrate force as quickly as possible at any point where the enemy had shown himself, so as to strike at him before he could run away; and the weapon most suited to do this was the aircraft. To develop this further: what was in the main an Army problem was to make the enemy show himself and then to indicate a target to the R.A.F. with the greatest possible speed. The R.A.F. problem was to get aircraft to the scene with the minimum of delay; after which the mutual problem of both was to stop the target from disappearing before it had been dealt with adequately by their combined efforts. The organization adopted with a view to meeting these requirements is described in full in Operation Order No. 8, reproduced here as Appendix XVIII. In brief, the Air Striking Force was composed of two squadrons and one flight of light bombers, and was based on Ramleh and Gaza with detacned flights as Samakh and Jisr Al Majami, The country was divided into Aircraft Zones, and a number of R.A.F. mobile wireless sets were ms ailed in lorries (known as ’’RODEX* vehicles) and distributed widely among Army detachments. The Rodex vehicles moved constantly all over the country with convoys and columns of troops who seemed likely to be ? 1 ° m ( ?r/n he targets for enem y attacks, while in addition aircraft fitted with W/T carried out continual low flying reconnaissance of possible poin s o con ac with the armed bands. In this way one or other me lum o communication was usually on the scene of every chance encounter. Immediately contact was made the Rodex or aircraft, con- farming to one frequency of the Aircraft Zone, would send out an 'XX” call, Gal1 f0r air su PP° rt 'by the Air Striking Force. ywjjj x 15 • / q^ aS 4 . °^ 0wed - 'by a simple code - described in Appendix XVIII - to indicate the location of the enemy, and if the detachment ^ e e nd r :rb ed + r inf ° rcins ° n the ™d y ; s well as in the air he suooort bv y the + saine means a call, which was a summons for support by the nearest military striking force.44816-1 107 The XX call was taken up by the R.A.F. signals organization and transferred to the appropriate air base, where aircraft were kept stand ing by at very short notice throughout the hours of daylight. A highly organized system at the air bases enabled aircraft to take off for the scene of the action immediately the XX call was received, and it was normal for aircraft to be in the air v/ithin five minutes of the despatch of the call. Since it was seldom more than 30 to 40 miles from the air base to the scene of action, a detachment commander who sent out an XX call could usually expect to see aircraft overhead within half an hour. On arrival the aircraft went into action immediately, troops assisting by indicating targets where necessary and controlling co-operative action by means of ground strips and light signals. GO calls v/ere accepted by the R.A.F. signals in the same way and transferred to the appropriate military area or formation headquarters. In addition to the Air Striking Force organization military area commanders had usually a call as well on allotted flights for recon naissance work and routine army co-operation duties, on which bombers had to be employed for most of the time owing to the lack of army co operation aircraft. Intercommunication between troops and aircraft In order to make the fullest possible use of the Air Striking Force it was essential that troops operating in the field should at all times be able to communicate quickly with the appropriate air base. Normally this was of course ensured by allotting Rodex vehicles, but it was not always remembered that an XX call could also be sent - though much more slowly - by means of the ordinary army signal channels. More often however the problem was to keep touch with the nodex, whicn was necessarily tied to the roads, when columns were operating in the hills. If pack wireless was available, this was best arranged by' stationing one terminal of the army wireless link with the Rodex under adequate guard at the nearest point of the road to the scene of operations. ^ If there was no pack wireless then a series of visual stations had to oe establis ed. Once aircraft were overhead communication from the ground was pro vided by means of the Middle East Ground Signal Code and by Verey lights. C ommun i c a t i on by lamp signals and mess age-picking-up was seldom pracoic able owing to the mountainous nature of the ground. The M.E. ground Code worked very well on the whole, though it needed a good d^a o practice, and reinforcements not trained in its use iound it &gt;/ery s ow at first.

The use of wireless had serious disadvantages. bombers were equipped with the r i.21 set v/hich had a trailing aerial and which necessitated the employment of an air gunner who was a 7//T operator. To use its T//T a light bomber had to break off action to climb and wind out an aerial v/hich trailed some 250 feet below and which of course had to be wound in again before the action could be resumed. Such interruption v/as particularly serious v/hen the aircraft was endeavouring to assist troops by pinning the enemy. Army co-opera tion aircraft had the T.R.2. set for both R/T and ’J/T purposes. Being fitted with a frame aerial, it was freed from the disadvantages of the bomber’s wireless and moreover did not require a W/T operator to work it On the other hand it lacked range and reliability, and the R/T tenders with which A.C. Squadrons were equipped did not give satisfactory results due chiefly to their age. , L iaison between troops and air c raft crew s This question has already been touched upon in the previous chapter, It v/as largely a matter of good telephonic communications, v/hich in Palestine were far from satisfactory, and an adequate lay-out of landing grounds. One Air Liaison Section only v/as available, and was stationed at Ramleh which was by far the most important air base. The work of the Air Liaison Section became all the more important since the air bases were in most cases some distance from the military area headquarters with which they were working. This made personal contact between commanders and aircraft crews difficult; and in spite of the liberal provision of landing grounds it v/as often impossible for aircraft to land near the headquarters of detachments in the field. In the case of pre-arranged operations it v/as usually possible for squadron and flight commanders to attend a military conference, or at least to visit the commander, and this personal contact was of very great value on all occasions. The chief difficulty however was to get sufficient informa tion to the pilot before he went into the air for a quick action such o.s that resulting from an XX call. The best solution was to ensure tnat the Air Liaison Section, or the commander of the air base, was kept continually up to date with a regular flow of military information, so tna. aircraft crews might have a chance of knowing at least the latest news of the general situation before going into the air. iraining in combined ope rations Perhaps the best way of all to arrange good liaison between troops vT n 1 ^ r + ft .

AIR GO-OPERATION El PRACTICE Such then were the arrangements made for securing the greatest possible degree of co-operation between aircraft and the troops in the field. It remains to be seen how they worked out in practice. Broadly speaking co-operation took four main forms :- (a) Offensive action against armed bands. (b) Reconnaissance. (c) Air escorts to land forces. (d) The use of aircraft for intercommunication and occasionally supply of army detachments. Offensive action against armed bands This sometimes took the form of air action alone, resulting from a chance encounter by an aircraft engaged on another task such as recon naissance or escort duty, but more often arose as a result of an XX call sent out from the ground and answered by the Air Striking Force. Before discussing the work of the Air Striking Force in detail, it may however be convenient here to quote an example of the former type of action in order to illustrate the striking power of a single independent aircraft operating against an armed band without the co-operation of troops other them the small infantry escort to a civilian convoy. The action took place on the 19th July among the barren and rugged hillsides which flank the road from Jericho to Jerusalem. Shortly before dark a convoy of Jewish lorries carrying potash from the Dead Sea v/orks was winding its way slowly up the very steep climb into Jerusalem and had still some ten miles to go, when fire was suddenly opened from about fifteen rilles on a piece of high ground overlooking the road at short range. Far away overhead was a high-flying bomber of No. 6 Squadron which had been watching the progress of the convoy almost out of sight .and hearing. The moment the firing started a red Verey light went up from the convoy escort, and down came the aircraft. Action with both front and rear guns quickly broke the enemy attack on the convoy, and a bomb attack v/as then delivered. As the main body of the rebels bolted for cover the pilot saw four others opening fire on the convoy from the cresu of a hill. He attacked with three bombs in salvo, and then dealt with his front gun with each of the fleeing figures until neighbouring caves had swallowed up the few survivors. The convoy was then escorted oafely into Jerusalem and the aircraft returned to Ramleh, where inspection showed that the enemy had scored hits in four places. Seven known Arab casualties had resulted from this engagement. To return to the XX call system and its results: inwall 47 calls were made and the aircraft which answered them accounted lor reoe casualties. Even this Even this limited experience of the XX ^ organization m :o point to a far wider application of its principles ander TJ- „ o-nnd ouDortuni ties to acall for action by the Air Striking Force. This however is rather beyond the scope of these pages, and the working of the XX system i n Palestine will perhaps best be illustrated by describing two typi ca ]_ actions by troops and aircraft in close combination. The first i s ^ example of the use of aircraft to pin an enemy with a view to enablin troops to close with him and complete his destruction. The second is one of the cases where air action was employed to destroy those porti of the enemy which had eluded the troops. For purposes of pinning or destroying different methods of attack were employed by the pilot. Which method he used depended either unon his own judgement or upon the wishes of the commander on the ground conveyed by means of ground code signals. The nature of the ground the opportunities for taking cover from air attack, and the disposition of the troops at the beginning of the action were the factors which would decide tne methods to be adopted by the aircraft in any particular set of conditions. Direct air attack usually had the effect of dispersin'- the enemy, so that when pinning action was required he was only attacked whenever he tried to move. This usually succeded in immobilising him on open ground, while in close country a similar result was obtained by driving him into cover and holding him there until troops could close. The first of the two actions took place in the early afternoon of the 26th July at the notorious Bab El Wad, a deep gorge some 14 miles from Jerusalem through the bottom of which the Jerusalem-Jaffa road winds its way out of the hills to emerge into the coastal plain. On this occasion news had been received of an impending attack in the area, and the daily convoy of Jewish vehicles seemed to be the likely target, me convoy was accordingly furnished with a military escort accompanied by d nod ex, while aircraft stood by at Rami eh and a platoon of the md Dorsets v/as disposed with due secrecy on high ground in the region wncrc attack seemed most probable. All went according to plan, and at 154-5 hours the convoy was suddenly fired upon by about 15 rifles in ambush at a point where the road ascended sharply - thereby compelling the convoy to reduce speed - and where wooded slopes closed in on the roa roiu oth sides. It was near to the site where the attack had been anticipated. • ^ escort with the vanguard at once fired a red Verey light to m iCcc e ne position c± tne enemy arid simultaneously the Rodex operator S -V?; niscal1 * . 400 yards in rear of the convoy a mortar lorry ° ? 12 soe4 ng the Verey light the detachment promptly went h iri1 ^ fr 0111 '^h-e lorry at 400 yards range and traversing to f , Hi P p' ea indicated by the direction of the Verey lights.

This was successfully carried out, and the remainder of the band despatched with the bayonet. The engage ment yielded 11 enemy dead, 11 rifles and 578 rounds of ammunition. Though only small numbers were engaged on each side, this little action provided an excellent example of combined attack by troops and aircraft; while its moral effect was fan out of proportion to the actual material results, since this was the first band to suffer complete destruction and the first time that troops had been able to close with the bayonet in open country. The second example is afforded by an action in the Nablus hills on the 24th September, in which far greater forces were involved than at Bab El 'Sifad. It started during the afternoon, when the 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers, accompanied by one aircraft, surrounded the village of Jab’a with a view to engaging an armed band which was believed to be inside. Shortly after this operation had started the aircraft located a band, which included a number of mounted men, retreating in wooded country away from the direction of Jab f a. Air action was promptly taken, but only one casualty had been inflicted before the aircraft was hit and the pilot wounded in tv/o places. He succeeded in making a forced landing, and meanwhile additional aircraft were summoned by XX calls. By this time enemy were appearing in all directions and it was soon evident that a number of bands were on the move in the neighbourhood. GG calls were therefore sent out, and were answered by striking forces from both Nablus and Tulkarm. Armoured cars of the 11th Hussars, Naval pom-poms, the light howitzers of the Chestnut Troop, and detachments of Lincolns and Dorsets were rushed out tov/ards Jab’a; but now little more than tv/o hours of daylight were left and both striking forces had some 12 to 15 miles to go before reaching even a debussing point. It v/as clear that there would be little opportunity of closing the enemy’s line of retreat with troops before dark, and that the Air Striking Force alone would be able to hit at the main body in time. The aircraft were soon on the scene and continued attacking until dusk, not only talcing independent action but also co-operating as well with those troops which had already gained contact with the rebels. As a result some 50 casualties were inflicted, of which 41 were accounted for by air action. During the engagement aircraft fired 3,322 rounds S.A.A. and dropped 33 bombs. Reconnaissance Information received from the air has already been described in Chapter 4 under the heading of 'Intelligence*. In general terms -ir reconnaissance took three main forms - reconnaissance to locate the enemy, ground reconnaissance, and reconnaissance to detect sabo a^e on the main communications. The first two were mostly carried ou allotted flights on the instructions of military area commanders. The latter was. more frequently ordered by Force H^and involved routine inspection of the main roads and railways with a view o o ing information of obstacles, ambushes, broken ^bridges, amc '£&gt; e lines etc. Information regarding the location of e enem} ^ mostly obtained when aircraft were acting in close co ^P erc ^ troops on such tasks as searches, cordons etc., since e re e ^ most other occasions would tend to hide^directly aircr^ .^ ^ c;po rG h the neighbourhood. It v/as air reconnaissance during^a ^ d ab # which resulted in the location of the eneimy a.

It is oa , iti ^ for rec0 n- sufficient army officers made the best use of noitring from the air. Certainly those who were fl44816-1 112 areas prior to a ground reconnaissance found it the greatest he]p in subsequent operations* The best results were obtained from reconnaissance when the pilot had been given details by the military commander as to the exact area to be searched, what he was required to look for, and me location and strength of co-operating troops. Air escorts Aircraft were widely used to escort M*T. convoys and, less frequently^ trains. So effective did they prove in this duty that convoying on one road, that from Jerusalem to Jericho, was protected by single air craft alone. Here traffic consisted chiefly of Jewish lorries from the Potash Works at the North end of the Dead Sea, accompanied only by a small infantry guard. The use of an air escort on this route not only effected an important economy in troops but also enabled casualties to be inflicted on several occasions, one of which has already been described. On the v/hole however the use of aircraft for escorting purposes could only be justified in special cases. It was not usually economical, and moreover had the disadvantage of discouraging the enemy from showing himself and thereby of losing opportunities of bringing him to action. He soon learnt that an ambush which might enable him to attack a convoy in comparative safety was vulnerable to attack from the air as soon as his position was disclosed. As a result a convoy escorted by alow- or medium-height aircraft was seldom attacked, and in fact in the later stages the provision of an air escort practically guaranteed immunity from any small scale attack. A high flying escort on the other hand offered more chance of surprise and enabled one aircraft to watch a number of roads simultaneously. This was the form of protection adopted with success during the one hour each day when the three biggest civilian convoys and their escorts all met at a cross-roads north of Nablus, and where there sorted out and marshalled for the second stage of the journey. The general deductions therefore regarding air escorts are that they are only justified in cases where it is specifically desired to avoid any attack, and that escorting troops with a Rodex are a more suitable form of protection if a secondary object is to strike at the enemy in addition to ensuring safe conduct of the convoy. Where air craft are used solely to economise in troops, and the intention is still to oring the enemy to action, then a high-flying aircraft is the better form of escort. The use of aircraf t for intercommunication and supply of troops One Communication Flight was stationed at Ramleh throughout the rebellion and was employed extensively in transporting military com manders and staff officers and in carrying urgent orders, air photographs e 7 ; yin S detachments.

Had the weather broken earlier however, or had operations extended on into the winter, there is no doubt that it might often have been necessary to resort to this method. Wriere small detachments were a long way out of reach, such as in desert country, supply by air had the additional advantage of doing away with any necessity for the escorting of supply columns. Examples of air supply were afforded by the maintenance of a section of armoured cars for three weeks in a remote desert post on the Egyptian frontier, and the delivery of supplies by parachute to a section of tanics in the hills near Tubas over a period of three days. CONCLUSION The brief descriptions which have been given in this chapter by no means exhaust the full range of the activities of aircraft in Palestine; and many tasks, such as the dropping of innumerable propaganda pamphlets etc. which may not properly come under the heading of “Co-operation with troops”, have been omitted. The main lesson that was learnt was that there were very few actions in which either troops or aircraft did not require the co-operation of the other to secure the best results. The success of that co-operation in practice was largely due to the organization of the system of XX calls, and the working of that system in the field was pernaps the most strikLa^ feature of the entire operations. Its application to a wider spnere in future would seem to be worthy of further examination.44816-1 114 CliAPTER 13 DSI^TuSXVE ACTION Xlvl RODUCTCRY It is unfortunately necessary to record that ’’Defensive Action' covers the greater part of the work of the armed forces in Palesti that must he the excuse for giving it precedence in these pages^ ^ ^ policy of the Administration and the methods adopted by its onoonent 6 forced the Services on to the defensive from the start', and for most 5 the period the initiative lay with the enemy.

Of the various categories, (a), (b), (g) and (h) naturally conducted their activities in as unobtrusive a manner as possible and did no t demand actual physical defence against their methods. They were in fact more the concern of the civil authorities and the police. (f), the ;\rmed Bands, were a purely military problem requiring direct offensive sction. It was therefore against (c), (d) and (e) that active defensive measures were most required. To reduce categories still further (c) and (e) may be classed together for practical purposes. The gunman or bomber was only another degree of the intimidator, and since both attacked life rather than property they can be taken together under that heading. The saboteur on the other hand attacked property first, and any loss of life which his efforts might involve was more incidental than deliberate. Under whatever heading the hostile elements may be classified they demanded certain precautions in common. The very casualness of their methods encouraged a relaxation of vigilance at the very moment when it was most dangerous, while their usual lack of originality in attack contributed towards a successful surprise on the few occasions when variation was produced, either by accident or intent. Constant vigi lance on all occasions and all-round protection in all positions was therefore essential, and all the more difficult to ensure from the very fact that it seldom seemed necessary. In those countries where a watchful enemy exacts a heavy penalty for every false move it is probably far easier to keep troops on the alert than in a country such as Palestine which seemed on the surface to be pervaded by a serene air of peace and where risks could be run with impunity nine times out of ten. It was too easy to forget that there might be a tenth time, until some incident like the attack on the York and Lancaster bathing party at Beisan^or the ambush of the newly-arrived Lincolns in the orange groves of Qalqilya served as a grim reminder that things were not quite so peaceful as^ they appeared. It is true that the rebels were lazy and lacked enterprise, but invisible eyes were usually noting every activity of die troops and the detection of a careless habit served as a hint that cheap^ victories might be picked up by those who were prepared to bide their time, this the Arab was always ready to do. Newcomers in particular were hard to convince of the danger: units would arrive keyed up with expectation, would find that deceptive air of peace, might go for nays or even weeks without seeing a shot fired, and too soon the origina^ precautions would start to slacken off.

The British Police During the period of rebellion the British Police totalled some 900 odd, of which well over 100 were recruits in their first year of service A fair proportion, including most of the older hands, were ex-soldiers and the standard of quality throughout was very high. The educational qualifications were exacting - a first-class certificate at least was demanded of army candidates - and in recent years a number of young men from the public schools had been attracted to the ranks of the Force. By far the greater majority was concentrated in the three main towns - Jerusalem, Jaffa-Tel Aviv, and Haifa - where the constant danger of inter racial outbreaks required the presence of ample reserves in normal times and v/here the lion’s share in the suppression of riots always fell to the British constables. For the same reason Hebron and Safad, which held Jewish minorities, contained small detachments of British Police. They were also stationed in small numbers in Nablus, Tiberias and Nazareth and a small mounted contingent patrolled mural areas. Thus it was only to be expected that with the exception of the mounted branch the majority of British police were more used to dealing with tov/ns and townspeople ” and only a small number had any knowledge of the villages and inhabi- ’ tants of the hill areas which were to become the haunts of the armed bands. In normal times these areas were the domain of the Arab police and so they remained for the most part throughout the rebellion. Shortage Ox personnel and transport and difficulties of supply prevented any British police being posted to the chain of rural stations in the hills around Nablus, and in consequence these posts in the very heart of tne arm^d band country ceased to be of practical value so far as suppres sion ox reoellion was concerned and much valuable information was lost thereby. i may well be argued tnat a better division of defence would have b een f '° leave the Bri oish x'olice in the towns to deal with riots and to concentrate the troops on the subjugation of bands in the rural areas, ihere were two potent reasons why this was not so easy as it sounds.

Unfortunately hov/ever they had had little tactical training and were not well organized for soldiers’ work. Too often in consequence gallantry in action was not applied to the best advantage, and one or two disasters occurred which trained soldiers might well have avoided. Meanwhile beats had to be patrolled and routine policing carried out, and under the special circumstances much of it had of necessity to be done by British personnel. There were times when soldiers were left to do this in amateur fashion while trained British policemen were out after armed bands, a reversal of roles which obviously resulted in both tasks being carried out with a loss of efficiency. Even when there was not an actual reversal of rbles a certain amount of duplication was difficult to avoid where police were used to perform soldiers' duties under quite separate control. A call for assistance from a Jewish colony which was being attacked would often be answered by both police and troops independently, while it sometimes happened that both police and military cars would be patrolling the same road. Apart from the waste of effort which all this involved, it necessitated very close personal touch between local commanders to avoid the possibility of an accidental clash. Had both police and troops been serving under one command, each would have been used for the type of role for which they were best fitted and there would still have been ample opportunity of ensuring that the British constable had an active share in the operations. But it would have avoided duplica tion of effort, would have saved all the loss of efficiency which re sulted from using soldiers as policemen and vice-versa, and above all would have enabled more troops to be employed upon offensive action. The advantages of a unified command therefore appears to provide the first lesson in the employment of troops and police on the task of suppressing rebellion. The Arab Police Arabs made up the majority of the regular police, numbering in round figures some 1500. They manned all the village police stations and posts in the rural areas, except those which were exclusively Jewish. Some of the rural stations were equipped with wireless and^ were admirably situated for collecting information regarding tne activi ties of armed bands, but for reasons which have already been explained practically none was ever forthcoming. In some cases it was even necessary to remove wireless sets from certain stations, and during at least one operation British police had to be sent to a post for the sole purpose of preventing the Arab constables from using the telephone, Arabs did however perform the very useful service of relieving uhe British Police of much routine work in the prevention oi ordinary crime and in duties such as traffic control. The Jewish Police The Jewish Police, in company with the rest of the Jews, suffered from a conviction which seemed to be firmly held oy every British official without practical experience that no Jew was ol a.ny use o^. fighting purposes. It was a curious thing that the type of Eng is. an who credited every Arab town lounger with the attributes ol Be °ain warrior would not hesitate to class the toughest German emigiant the old-fashioned ringletted Jew of the ghetto. The lalsity 01 this view was plainly demonstrated to the Army t&gt;y the worx of he ews \ drove most of the military transport in 1936, while tne records of 19 18 might well have provided further proof; but^never e ess in ° quarters the conviction persisted. In the Police i n^d^one j.mpoi effect in preventing any Jewish Police being posted oO Ara &amp;r a118 44816-1 It was argued that the more aggressive Jews - particularly in the ranks of the Supernumerary Police - might use their .aims offensively in an indiscriminate manner, while those who were less aggressive would need British Police to protect them from the Arab inhabitants. Thus the Jewish T’olice were kept in the towns and in purely Jewish areas and as there were nothing like enough British Police to go round, Arab areas were left mostly to the Arab police. To some extent the prevailing low opinion of their martial Quali ties may have been responsible for the low proportion of Jews in 'the regular Police Force. There were however other important reasons for this: the Jew demanded a higher salary and 'was disinclined to work in a rural area. At the beginning of 1956 there were less than 400 Jewish regulars and this number only increased by about 100 during the course of the year. A large proportion were confined to Tel Aviv whence they could not be moved owing to the terms of their enlistment. Special Constables On the outbreak of the rebellion a number of British civilians and some Jews did duty as Special Constables in Jerusalem, Haifa, and Jaffa- -cl -T-viy; but once it became clear that the period of unrest was likely to continue indefinitely the majority were compelled to curtail police services more and more to attend to their own businesses. Once the danger point had been passed with the arrival of substantial military reinforcements most of the Special Constables returned to their normal activities. It is perhaps questionable whether their services were used to the best advantage: most of them were of the type which might nave provided officers, and officers - particularly British officers - were sorely needed for the Supernumerary Police. It is possible that ne young English business man would have found more congenial and use- Ul employment in officering Supernumerary Police than in standing guard after office hours over a bank or post office.

The normal procedure in the almost nightly 'attacks” on Jewish colonies was somewhat as follows. The Arabs would take up positions behind suitable cover after dark from which they could fire at longish range. The first round would be the signal for the Supernumeraries to man their defence posts and ooen heavy rifle fire in the direction of the enemy, accompanied as a rule by Verey lights. For' a short time a fire fight would go on during which targets would seldom be visible to either side and neither would move from their prepared cover. Eventually the Arabs, fearing tne arrival of reinforcements and feeling that honour had been satis fied would withdraw in the dark and return to their homes for the right’s rest - 8 to 10 p.m. would usually be the hour of attack and all would be over well before midnight. In the meanwhile news of the attack would have reached a police post by telephone - or the news of the light signals would have been passed on - and a couple of truckloads of British Police or troops, or often both, would make for the scene. In most cases either the sound or lights ox the cars would bo ilxe final signal for any Arabs who still remained to slip away by familiar tracks long before the reinforcements could gain contact. Action of the type described may sound very unenterprising, but on the other hand it is difficult to see wnat else the oupernumercu ieo could have done with their small numbers and lack of tactical training. Their object after all was to drive off Arabs attacking their colonies, and this they invariably succeeded in doing. Few Arabs ever actually set foot inside a colony and most of the casualties they inflicted were the work of stray bullets. Besides at times carelessness on tne part of the attackers or an ingenious surprise on the part of reinforcements would result in rebel casualties. The Arab Supernumeraries if attacked would carry out exactly the same procedure, but it is to be feared that -too often they purchased immunity for the property in tneir charge ^ y exchanging live rounds for empties. But that sort of thing is perhaps only to be expected when members of the defence forces are drawn from the same section of the population as the reoels themselves, he logic of employing them for this purpose is open to question. The great drawback of the Supernumeraries was the handicap they often placed on military action. Their indiscriminate shooting at night was a real danger to troops operating in the vicinity, wm e their liberal use of the S.O.S. signal resulted in too maiiv roopo being employed on profitless tasks. Difficulties v/ere increase the fact that their lack of proper organization made it almost unpos for trooos to arrange any proper co-operation vith oiem as W1 p regular police. The solution would have been to organize and o^icer the Supernumeraries on the pattern of the regu ar po ice, possible, to place the whole police system under tne commander o, ti military forces. THE SHPLOYIEH? OF TPOOPS ON DEFEDSIVE DJTIES General Certain restrictions on the use of letha! weapons had aHt^^ bearing on the value of troops for these de ensive W rules military or a police role. In particular there were tnree rules44816-1 120 imposed by the Palestine Government to obviate danger to innocent persons which proved to be a serious handicap. They were worded as follows * ~ (i) No person should be fired on by troops for failing to hai + when chal lenged unless that person is s een or known to be iri— possession of arms , or was seen to throw a bomb, ' “ (ii) Exception may be made at night when troops have been fi on in the neighbourhood, or when a British Officer or Seri.earvT considers that a person or a group of persons is acting wit h~~ hostile intention. In that case the order to fire sho uld be given by the Officer or Sergeant . (iii) The above does not affect the right of troops to fire in s elf defence, or in the defence of civilians, or upon anyone ^ guilty of sabotage. It is hardly necessary to make further comment on the difficulties of conducting military operations under such restrictions, and the dilemma of a sentry acting under those orders may well be imagined. It will be noted that he could not open fire in order to prevent sabotage, nor could he use his rifle to prevent a person approaching him with tne intention of using a concealed revolver or bomb. There is no doubt that the rebels got to know of these orders, and more than one sentry fell a victim before they were altered. Continual representa tions by the Force Commander did eventually succeed in securing some revision, but it was not until the 3rd September that any important alterations were made. From that date sentries were authorised to ' to P ro ^ ec t whatever they were guarding”, while the authority of a _Brinish Officer or Sergeant” was extended to include any N.C.O, or private soldier in command of a detachment. Even then the rules were bv no oadiofac oory; while in addition the use of artillery, mortars and nfie grenades was prohibited in the vicinity of buildings, and ™ at Jjewis ^ RS in towns and villages severely restricted. e l lwGG . “ n °t the least of which was the psychological e ^eco - uo reduce considerably tne value of troops in combatting trie mtimidator and saboteur.

This con tinual bolstering up of a Police Force v/hich can no longer maintain law and order only leads to postponing further and further the change over to military control, and may result in so great a dispersal of troops as to ruin the commander*s initial plan for the assumption of military control. The answer of course is that once the situation has become so bad that the police cannot carry on without using soldiers on police duties, then the time has come for militaiy control. With military control the troops and the police will come under the same commander, and will be used on the duties most suited to their particular characteristics. To mix them together on precisely the same tasks must obviously be uneconomical and unsatisfactory. Unfortunately however such good intentions were not always easy to put into practice, particularly when the civil government remained in supreme control, and perhaps a brief survey of developments in 1936 will best illustrate the point. The first month of rebellion was a period of rioting in which fire arms were seldom used on either side: the burden of this period naturally bore heaviest on the police - and chiefly on the British Police - and when the strain began to tell requests were made for relief by troops in order to gain the police much-needed rest. On the 13th May therefore troops took over the duty of convoying motor traffic on the main roads, and on the 19th May some 100 odd soldiers were diverted to relieve police from guarding public buildings, power stations, telephone exchanges etc. At the time there were only three infantry battalions in the country and these added tasks left only 30^ of the garrison free for offensive duties. A week later further requests from the civil authori ties led the Force Commander to address the following message to all areas:- ' Can Area Commanders do anything to assist the police, who are very tired, at once by relieving them of certain duties temporarily ? In answer to this message further reliefs were effected. On ceroain days the entire v/ork of some rural police stations was undertaken by _ . _ _ 1 -nn r,r*nls replaced police in the duty of enforcing curfew hours in towns, so ^er escorts were put on the front seats of Jewish lorries and buses, an in certain cases all night patrolling between police stations wao carrie ou w 4 -v.t c waa nof. pnmicrh. and soon afterwards selected soldiers, military guards were mounted on other police stations, parols All this reinforcement did not however seem to nm-u44816-1 122 distributed among the shopping streets of Jerusalem and Jaffa as an ' intimidation' measure. At this time 5Cffo of the garrison were tied to defensive duties in spite of considerable reinforcement, and one Brig h had no less than 377 men employed upon duties in relief of police. In discussing the matter with the Inspector-General of Police on the 8th July, the senior army officer at Force Headquarters put in the follow ing terms his view of the situation: 'Military operations which arp essential are definitely being interfered vath owing tothe cont inual large demands made by the civil administration or p olice for p It is vitally necessary at this juncture for villagers in remote anrH^i accessible parts to see the troops and to see them frequen tly. — cannot be done if troops are being confined to toymis on static polios ~ duties'. No appreciable change of policy, however, followed and this drain on military resources continued throughout; until even in late September when the 1st Division was moving across Palestine to take up position it v/itnessed the melancholy spectacle of pairs of soldiers each with one policeman, standing at street corners or pacing outside shou windows on 'anti-intimidation' patrols. ' ^ The effect of such employment on the morale of the troops was scarcely less important than its effect upon the military plan. If the police liked doing soldiers' work, the soldiers cordially detested the policemen's; and the anti-intimidation patrol, which in Practice in evitably placed soldiers under the orders of a policeman in all except m name, was^the most unpopular of all. In the early stages the troops accepted their new tasks cheerfully enough, knowing that the police had ad a^bad time and needed rest, but after weeks had passed and this reason ceasea to be valid opinions rather changed. Soon all units were findincr io ex reme y difficult, to give their men a reasonable number of nights in bed, most of them were living in tents with much discomfort from sand and ion was short and rare and organized games unknown.

It is open to question44816-1 123 whether that energy might not have been better expended in the more direct suppression of rebellion. Whether troops or police were better suited to provide any guard depended chiefly upon the type and scale of attack expected. Again both employed quite different methods. The police guard did not advertise its presence: it was there as much to catch individual wrong doers as to guard the property in its charge, and was seldom strong enough to resist a determined attack in any strength. The military guard on the other hand was solely concerned with keeping away attackers, which it did by a plain display of force or if that was not enough by- opening fire: it was ready to resist any attack but was by no means suitable for making arrests. A military guard was therefore always more extravagant in personnel and was preferable only at points where serious attack might be expected, so that it would have been more logical to use police at places where the individual saboteur (who was much better captured than driven off) was the principal danger. picquets and escorts were mostly utilized in the protection of com munications, and are more the province of the following chapter. Pic quets were however also used in some cases to prevent the sniping of camps, and it may be convenient to include here some notes as to the forms which they took. The most useful type was found to be the 'Sangar Picquet' illustrated on Page 82 of the Field Service Pocket Book 1952 . The walls required careful building, and consisted as a rule of two outer skins of rock about one foot apart with the space between filled in with small stones and earth. The inner wall had to be high enough to prevent tne men on the far side of the picquet from being hit. A double-apron barbed wire fence surrounded the post at a distance of about 20 yards from the outer wall, and inside there were five double-ridge tents for the garrison and a bell tent for a native police guide. The space required was about 24 yards square, which was sufficient to accommodate a platoon about 20 strong. Latrines and ablution accommodation were usually ^ Picquets was being established or withdrawn, e place at much the same hour each day.44816-1 A searchlight was a most valuable addition to any picquet, but few were available for this purpose and for the most part it was necessary to rely upon Verey lights. DEFENCE OF LIF E The intimidators who constituted the chief threat to life and limb were of four types. There was the deliberate murderer who selected his victim, the casual bomber or gunman who was quite indiscriminate the long-range sniper, and the unarmed town bully. They were by no , means of the do-or-die fraternity, and all four had one characteristic in common in that none of them were prepared to run serious risks to their own lives. As a rule therefore they would only strike when they were pretty certain that no serious fire would be returned. On the other hand arrest had little terror for them. Experience had long con vinced them that there were always good chances of an acquittal that even a sentence of imprisonment would in all probability be a light one and in any case it was most unlikely that it would ever have to be served in full. After all there had not been a single execution during the year and many of the convicted assassins of the 1929 riots were already released and free in 1956. It was undoubtedly the feeling of immunity from having to pay for a crime v/ith his life that enabled the intimidator to operate so freely. The remedy of course lay more with the Law than with the defence forces: things might have been better had the police been encouraged to use their arms rather more freely, but speedy justice and the example of some death penalties would have done more than anything to curb the activities of the intimidator. Again this would have been best assured under Martial Law, which might also have helped indirectly by imposing restrictions upon the movements of inhabitants through the introduction of compulsory identification cards and other measures of a similar type.

For him the get-away had to be cei c l n y . cnac wao of iiiucn more importance than the selection of his victim. i'iost of the latter were no more than passing Jews, or suspected Jews, or the rank and file of the Arab strike-breakers - villagers bringing vegetables to market, shopkeepers doing a furtive business at the bac k moor, 01 in fact any mrab uoing any sort of business at all» The explosion of a Mills bomb in a crowd of vegetable sellers at the Jaffa ‘j-ate of Jerusalem, v.hich caused 26 casualties, provided a typical example of hio vor.:'_» Ic ‘v.as the fact that he was so indiscriminate that made thio cype difficult co contend with* Again the best preventive was to use e^eiy means of making his task more and more dangerous, while at the same time insisting on officials and members of the Services at least adopting elementary precautions for their own safety. It was noticeable how seldom soldiers or airmen were selected as targets by this type of terrorist, and two airmen who were shot Y. r hile walking on the outskirts of Jerusalem were the sole victims. The fact that°troops never went about singly, were usually armed, and were known to have little hesitation in using their arms, accounted to a great extent for their comparative immunity. Avoidance of notorious areas - especially on foot - frequent variation of habits, and a wary eye on suspicious characters were always necessary. The bomber ’was such a prominent local product as to deserve special mention. Strangely enough so far as the effects of his own weapon were concerned he seemed for once to display a conplete disregard of all danger, and the accidental mortality among all who handled bombs v/as extraordinarily high. Yet, with usual Arab indifference, their manu facture in the family circle by the very crudest methods continued to flourish all over the country; and the frequent entries in official communiques of ' unlocat ed bomb explosion reported..... generally marked the passing of some over-confident munition maker. Even when finished the Palestinian bomb as often as not went off at the wrong time, and it is not far from the truth to say that in the long run they probably caused more damage to their owners than to the general public. This was rather surprising in view of the unrivalled facilities in Palestine for making bombs. So much of the country is rook that even the simplest building operation necessitates blasting, and in consequence large stocks of explosives are distributed over the country together with inhabitants possessing a rough-and-ready knowledge of their use. Some Arab families even continued to make their livings by manufacturing explosives under government licence. In addition the Great War had littered the country with ammunition dumps which had never been properly cleared and which continued to provide endless sup£)lies of cordite, shells and old hand grenades. The home-filled Mills bomb in particular was one of the most dangerous weapons - to both sides. 1 The sniper represented a still lower degree in the rebel scale. He took even fev/er risks since he was always behind good cover and fired at long range, while his standard of musketry only required him to be able to land his bullets in some part of a camp or town. He very seldom accounted for any casualties, but his nuisance value was rather higher than that of any other intimidator. The knowledge of this, however, probably counted far less with him than the fun he got out of it and the cheap local prestige which he gained. He alv/uys operated at night and usually alone, working regular hours within comfortable reach of his own home and surprisingly conservative in his habits. Military opinion at the end of 1936 was unanimous that the last way to treat the sniper was to return his fire with rifles, an action which only encouraged him to think he was doing more harm than was actually the case and which dia not affect him behind his carefully chosen cover. A better answer was to reply with artillery, mortars, or concentrated machine-gun fire. This was often effective where the favourite haunts of snipers were known and had been registered, and the discovery of live ammunition44816-1 126 abandoned on the position often bore v/itness to a hasty flight at 1 Certainly it never failed to stop the sniping for the evening. practicable, picquetting was probably the best defence, but offensive action was always necessary. Opinion varied as to methods, but ingenuity was the best recipe for success. Stalking snipers with th bayonet and rifle-grenade, lying up in ambush near likely positions o the routes to them, or laying an ambush near a village to catch return' snipers were all tried and met with mixed success. Good section leading and a frequent change of method helped to secure results. Punitive measures against villages were also useful and varied from the imposition of a curfew to forms of active repression. g The last class of intimidator was the unarmed bully, who might have remained in police care alone had not the anti-intimidation patrol brought troops into contact with him. 'This type was drawn from the ranks of the ordinary street corner lounger. They usually worked* together in small gangs armed with sticks and their role was the beating- up of strike-breakers, together with the destruction of their stalls or the smashing of their shop windows. Being essentially bullies 'they respected neither age nor sex, their methods were always brutal and they seldom operated when troops or police were in the vicinity! * The best cure for them would probably have been a series of round-ups by plain clothes police, followed by a liberal award of flogging sentences, In the absence of this the anti-intimidation patrols were certainly a good preventive, their moral effect was useful and they undoubtedly succeeded^ in keeping the shops open. By this they contributed towards ^maintaining the normal life of the country” - but the cost was high.

This was tried with marked success in Palestine and effected many economies. Booby traps could be used in different ways according to whether their object was to frighten saboteurs avray from places where their attentions were only a nuisance, or to provide positive protection to some really vital point. In the former bluff sometimes played a part and very seldom failed, while in the latter 10($ protection could be assured provided the safety device was thoroughly concealed. Saboteurs on the whole displayed little technical knowledge and often overlooked the weakest links in any chain. To place a guard over these might have drawn attention to possibilities which had so far been neglected, and at such places therefore guards were deliberately avoided and protection secured by means of booby traps. Experience proved the wisdom of these methods. CONCLUSION At the beginning of this chapter the first object of the armed forces has been quoted as being the maintenance of the normal life of the country, and the same object is given first place in Imperial Policing, 195 4. But before closing the question may well be asked as to -whether it is the most important aim. Experiences in Palestine go to shov/ that under conditions of rebellion the normal life of the country cannot continue, and the expenditure of a great deal of military effort to pretend that it can may only result in a prolonga tion of the struggle. Rebellion is after all only one form of War, and in war the aim is defined as H overcoming the will of the enemy to continue the struggle by forcing him to realize that his aim is impossible of attainment or beyond the effort that he is prepared to make. M (E.S.RTTlI, 1955, Sec. . One of the v/ays of doing this is to deny him the means of conducting his national life and, though it vdll seldom be politic to apply this in full to rebellion, it must surely be illogical to use armed force to maintain the national life, which of course includes that of the entire rebel population. In fa.ct a partial paralysis of life has certain definite advantages: it is bound to handicap rebel actiyioies, it releases most of the military forces from defensive duties, it frees large numbers of civilians to swell the ranks ol the police and volunteer forces, and must of sheer necessity shorten the period of resistance. It v/ill of course injure innocent people with the guilty, but it v/ill remove that apathy v/hich prevailed among so many of the population of Palestine. In rebellion there can be no neutrals, an all who are not in revolt must play their part in suppressing it. When rebellion has forced business to a standstill the waverer with little sympathy for either side is likely to be forced into acti\e participation on the side of the Government in order oo restore con ditions v/hich mil enable him to resume his occupation. In Palestine a large proportion of the people cared more for business than P 0 ^ 1 - and took no active part on either side: if able to do so, they ^ ae impartially with both and thus helped considerably in prolonging the struggle. Imperial Policing names as the second task the gubjectiop_^f__t^ig. hostile elements , r . and Operation Instruction No. 23 conformed in giving the armed forces their second object in Palestine. after v * a ' been said above it may be considered that the order of iinpox ^nce o _ the two aims should at least be reversed, and it may even be better m future to take the second aim as the sole one. Each requires vei^y different action by the forces, and the attempt to attain o mPalestine led to a serious division of strength and resulted in neither being thoroughly fulfilled. F.S.R. again gives it as the task of the three services to 11 act in combination to break d o/ m the enerny ’s resistance', adding that ' it will usually be nec e ssary to de feat q r neu tralise the enemy's armed forces and so to depr i ve h im of the no y/er on which he chiefly rel j^sjto^b^n^a^de cisio n in his favou^ l, .' It ~ is suggested that the same’ should hold good in armed rebellion, and that under such conditions the first and only object of the three services should be: ' To get to grips with the hostile elements and brin^ them int n_ subjection. '44816-1 129 ChAPTER 14, PROTECTION OF COMMINinATIONS G^mAL Since the sahote^ar directed the greater part of his labours towards the destruction of communications, it was inevitable that the majority ox troops on defensive cLuciss should have been occupied in their pro** section. Generality tney were of two types, the first being communica tions necessary for military purposes. These consisted of:- (a) Rail communication from Egypt to Lydda, and thence to Haifa and Jerusalem. (b) The main roads and the motor traffic on them, especially the three main arteries: the North-South road from Nazareth to Jerusalem through Nablus, and the two East-West roads from Tiberias to Nazareth and Haifa and from Allenby Bridge to Jerusalem and Jaffa. (c) The civil telephone (and telegraph) system - expecially the overhead lines, following the main roads, linking Jerusalem with Haifa, Nablus, and the Sarafand-Jaffa-Lydda-Ramleh area. (d) The pipe-line which brought the Jerusalem water supply from the neighbourhood of Petah Tiqya. All of these were of course equally important to the needs of the civil population; but the maintenance of communications in the second category was not strictly essential to either, and in ordering their protection the Government was influenced by wider considerations beyond the immediate needs of Palestine. In this category wtre:- (e) The feeder line of the Hedjaz Railway running from Haifa to A1 Hamme, via Beisan and Samakh. Beyond A1 Hamme the line entered French Territory and continued to Damascus, so that its mainten ance had to be ensured in French interests. Furthermore the strange situation existed in that the kilometres of line betv/een Samakh and A1 Hamme was operated by the French although lying within the borders of Palestine. (f) The oil pipe-line of the Iraq Petroleum Company, running from Jisr Al Mejami to Haifa. Of these two the importance of securing French interests can readily be understood and any military efforts expended on their behalf were adequately repaid by the friendly co-operation of French troops on their own side of the frontier. Besides this railway, although not essential, was undoubtedly of value for both military and civilian purposes and under the circumstances its protection oy force of arms was amply justified. The sane can scarcely be said of the pipe-line, which was of no local military importance ana of no _ interest to any but a very small section of the population. i-s destruction would have hit hardest Arab interests, and it may safely oe surmised that Iraqi influence with the rebel leaders alone would have been sufficient to guard against anything more than minor sabotage of nuisance value only. It is difficult therefore to avoid regaiding military effort expended on its protection as wasteful diversion irom more productive duties.44816-1 130 In addition to the communications described above there were of course others which played their part in ,l maintaining the normal lif e of the country’ 1 , and it was often necessary to resist firmly pressure from the civil departments to give military protection to non-essential communications. It is only natural that each department should alwav want to keep its own particular system in constant operation, knowin? that once any section is abandoned to the cares of the enemy the co^ts of repair become cumulative, with the result that in the end a heavv^ bill and a long period of work have to be faced before the section is again earning any revenue. Hence each department will vie with the other to secure military protection. The case of the Jerusalem-Hebron telephone line will serve to illustrate the point: here the Jewish population had been removed to safer quarters and the government officials, police and troops were served by wireless; moreover alterna tive communications were usually available via Gaza. It was therefore' the Arab population who were the principal sufferers from the consequences of sabotage, and the employment of troops to prevent it was hardly justified. Incidentally it was found in practice that a relaxation of military precautions on this route resulted in the saboteurs turning their attention more to the routes which were better guarded and there fore obviously the ones which the military were most anxious to keen Apart from the professional saboteur, the whole length of these communications lay open to minor attacks from every Arab village within comfortable reach, most of which would make it a point of honour to earn a bad name for the section which ran through their neighbourhood. T u * in such circumstances the best cure is plainly some form of PIPE LIKE PR O TECTION The Jerusalem Water Supply Line n-p 4-V^ • U ^ -LH OCX X ne pipe, and it was fortunate that here44816-1 131 again troops employed on the protection of the road and the railway could look after the pipe line at the same time. One extra precaution was necessary in order to guard against sabotage inside the pumping stations and to ensure that no interruption occurred through defection of the native staff. This was achieved by stationing small parties of Sappers in each station, who were also useful in affording extra protection in the event of attack. Tnese protective measures were successful in preventing any serious dislocation of the v/ater supply, but it must be admitted that the rebels may never have intended that to happen knowing that any real shortage of water in Jerusalem would hit the Arab inhabitants worst of all. At the pumping stations there were no attacks more serious than casual sniping, but a fair number of cases of interference with the pipe and valves did occur in spite of all efforts to stop them. Some were successful in causing a temporary stoppage but the effect of this was small, while on occasions clear evidence remained to show that the bocby trap had claimed at least one victim. The fact that the Arab is not above using a trust ing compatriot to test this sort of defence is of course a v/eak point in the booby trap system, and had more determined attacks on the water pipe been made it is likely that a more active defence would have become necessary. The Iraq Petroleum Company^ Oil Pipe-Line The oil pipe was a very different proposition. Entering Palestine just South of Jisr Al Mejami it ran straight across country to a point on the railway North of Mishmar Ha Emeq, where it swung right to reach its terminus on the coast between Haifa and Acre. Nowhere did it follow any good road, but throughout its length was buried three feet below the surface. It too had its valves, but fortunately there were no pumping stations to be guarded between the place of entry and the terminus. It had great attractions to the local village saboteur, who cared little that Arab financial interests were the principal losers. Some digging on an inaccessible hill where detection was most unlikely, a rifle bullet at close range, a flame to the oil jet and a most satisfactorily spectacular fire resulted. In point of fact the damage was small, since loss of pressure at the pumping station soon showed what had happened and enabled the flow to be cut off. After that thick clouds of black smoke and flame readily guided the repair party to the puncture, where repairs were soon effected and the oil valves re-opened - but not before the culprit had retreated to a distant hill from which he could point v/ith pride to his handiwork. Night sabotage was chiefly favoured as dark ness not only made the saboteur’s work safer but also contributed to the spectacular effect. In all 53 cases of sabotage occurred. Protection in this case had to be directed chiefly to the pipe itself, since neither pumping stations nor valves offered as easy a target. The only approach for any form of M.T. was the tracK alongside the line made by lorries carrying pipes at the time of construction. This proved to be extremely rough going, so that progress b&gt; J.I^ was necessarily slow and noisy and gave no opportunity ior suprise, ohe saboteur having only to move a short way away and hide among the rocks until the danger was past. For this reason armoured car patroio, which were tried at first, were of small value and the cars suifered severely from the bad going. Infantry in trucks were an improvement as ruses could be adopted such as dropping off men en route who could lie up in ambush; but the local villager was usually too war^ caught like that and was on the watch at once when any form of M.T. was heard in the neighbourhood. Cavalry and foot patrols followed, but neither was ever very successful while continual night patrolling with44816-1 132 few results to show for it had a wearing and depressing effect troops. Finally anti-aircraft searchlights were used°to light pipe-line from commanding positions, while machine-gun sections w- 6 disposed to fire at various points within the arc. This method ^ certainly proved successful, and saboteurs rarely ventured within zone of the lights, not knowing where the machine-guns might be ? it was of course expensive protection since one light with i^ * and machine-gun section was lucky if it could protect more than^ 0 ?^ miles of pipe. Fortunately in Palestine almost all sabotage was r° t to the hills and Jewish Supernumerary Police proved to be adequate COntlne(i protection for the last twenty miles of pipe, which ran over the i • through mainly Jewish areas. Though anti-aircraft searchli.?hts seldom likely to bo available for this sort of work on a future no 2 • any form of lighting of a pipe-line -will be of value as a dete•rr t --n^ S10n, even if it is only to drive the saboteur into the unlit sections \ places theref ore whore lack of roads makes patrolling difficult and surprise by patrols almost impossible, a combination of lights with well-concealed or roving machine-guns is probably the best°answer. C -Qj gl usion s regardin g p ipe- li ne protect ion The first conclusion to be drawn from the above is that protect:!nr, of a pipe-line will usually result in wasted effort if its main?^ is not really essential to the needs of the moment. I„ any ease toW r -strictodd to th ^ 'J 11 Se p 0 “ be P ossible &gt; «&gt;* efforts should be the flow'll J ^ protectlon of *'086 points where damage would stop the flow for a long period.

It needed c e &amp; ra Ph poles and then take av/ay lengths44816-1 133 of wire; v/hat is more it harmed no one but the British, the Jews and the rich town Arabs, and so was regarded as fair game by every villager within reach. In fact in a great many cases there was definite evidence pointing to the village responsible. ¥ith telephone line sabotage therefore, more than with any other, civil action could provide a strong deterrent when properly applied. It goes without saying that stem collective punishments must be meted out to villages v/hich can be proved to have been involved, while in addition the line may be parcelled out among them and the headmen warned that any interference in their sections will be followed by collective fines or other punishment. This was tried in Palestine in the later stages and failed only because the threatened penalties were too often never exacted. Another civil measure v/hich aided military action was the declaration of a curfew zone along the main communications. This enabled troops to open fire on the roads etc. at night - the time when most sabotage took place - with a minimum of risk to innocent persons. Military protection of the system was afforded in the first place by providing guards over the main telephone exchanges, from vhich escorts were despatched with the breakdown gangs, while in those with a purely Arab staff R. Signals personnel were installed as monitors. The escorting of breakdown gangs was also carried out mostly by the R. Signals, who in addition gave a good deal of much-needed help in the actual repair work. Most of the civil linemen were Arabs, who loyally continued their work under great difficulties in spite of much overv/ork, due to the continual sabotage, and constant intimidation. At first a roadside camp of some 45 of these men was installed in the centre of the sabotage area, but it soon became necessary to move them into Nablus for reasons of safety, while in other cases linemen were based upon protected exchanges^ Even so intimidation continued and broken poles would be found ’with H Black Hand” warnings threatening death to any Arab who continued to carry out repairs, v/hile men at work or en route to a job were always liable to attack. All this combined to strain the linemen almost to breaking point, and but for the protection and assistance given to them by their R. Signals escorts they would certainly have given up entirely at an early stage. Protection of the line itself was combined entirely v/ith that of the roads, and both can best be considered together later. Again untiring efforts to obtain surprise were the chief requirement, since telephone line sabotage was so quickly done that straightforv/ard patrol ling would hardly ever catch the saboteur in the act and was even of^ doubtful value as a deterrent. Two mechanical devices v/ere also tried, but neither met ’with very much success. The electrification of certain sections of the line claimed one or two victims at first out had many technical difficulties, v/hile the Arabs soon learnt to throv/ ropes over the wires to break connection before continuing with tne work. In some districts camelriders were used to cut the wires without having to swarm up the poles. The other was a device by which t e location of a break could be detected the moment it occarro , so troops in M.T. could rush out at once to the spot.^ j.nis ma^ helped tov/ards quick repairs, but generally the saboteur was o i m o the darkness the moment he detected the lights or sound o a cm ana had vanished by the time it reached the break. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that any attemp^ to main tain telephone and telegraph communications by force of arms is se worth while. At the best constant interruption, couplea with the need for secrecy wherever a native staff mans the exc xanges, mus i , military to rely more and more upon their R/T an / • , often be better to rely entirely upon these rather than to divert m troops to purely defensive duties. In any cas^ mi ^ - v inval should be confined to the defence of telephone exc ange c ^ nQt workers. This may ensure a limited service w ere -44816-1 134 extensive, but has the disadvantage that it is not likely to be easy to secure civil permission to withdraw troops if sabotage increases so much later on as to make complete abandonment of the system desirable. In Palestine it took nearly two companies of infantry in addition to R. Signals to look after six exchanges, (with their linemen), the Broadcasting Station, and one special vulnerable point connected with the system. Finally it is worth remembering that maintaining the line by military action means preserving it for the benefit of the disloyal as well as the loyal elements. ROAD PROTECTION The Road itself At the start of the rebellion attacks were directed rather more to the road itself than to the traffic upon it, though later the reverse was more the case after the appearance of the armed bands. The road problem was slightly different from that presented by the pipe-lines and telephones in that effective sabotage was far more difficult, needed more tools and skill, and took much longer to complete. Hence patrols stood a better chance of interrupting the work at least, even if they might still fail to catch the culprits. To begin with sabotage mostly took the form of obstruction with rocks etc. and attempts to blow up bridges, but in the later stages mines were more in favour. Obstructions were almost entirely the work of local villagers and where they were not combined with an ambush had only a delaying value. In some cases they were however rather more formidable than they sound: the bigger ones even extended at times over a hundred yards of surface, and in places^where a steep hillside overlooked the road rocks might be rolled down of a size which called for elaborate efforts in their removal. minor vice of the same type, which was hardly less effective in action, was the strewing of nails or even specially-prepared barbs of twisted iron.

Kln “ 18 ° f . roa ^ smarted a good deal later, and was rather more sen ,i, : ; sxnoe it led directly to casualties, whereas other fomns of roaa S'.botage caused little more than delays and ertra work for the troops. The first attempt at this sort of terrorism was the institu tion OI a si \[n.e lOeu &lt;uook of stones inside which was hidden a Mills bomb The pm was wi.harawn and the lever held down by jarmdng the bomb between stones, oO th&lt;,.L, the lever vrould be freed and the bomb set off by anvone removing the stones. This type of trap had little value once the troops nac. learnt to be on me look out for it, owing to the fact that the delay action of the bomb gave the would-be victim time to throw it awav and take cover when it had been detected. They were practically dis- carded later once it had become the usual practice to utilise labour from nearby villages to clear road blocks. There is also a suspicion that accidents m installing bombs may have caused more casualties than those in removing them. The road-mine proper was a good deal more formidable. It was buried^ just below the surface and set off by contact or by means of a 1 1 ip-wixe v/hich was fastened to a wire loop holding down the striker. The body of the mine was either an old live shell or a length of 27-' pipe filled with gelignite and rusty nails. Fastened to the mine'by means 01 a metal strap was a device similar to a mouse trap with the strikox held back by a loop of wire. In the body of the mine a hole WG.S drilled to ^ take a detonator inserted in the explosive filling, and a nail was positioned over the detonator. As soon as the striker loop was released the striker would spring over and hit the nail, which set Oc.f the detonator and exploded tne charge. Though the manufacture of these internal machines must have been a most hazardous pursuit, it has to oe admitted that they seldom failed in operation and the few failures were mostly due to 'dud” shells. The surprising thing is how very few casualties tney did cause: the 8th Hussars, who operated over sand tracks where mines were almost impossible to detect at night, had no less than twelve cars blown up without serious casualties resulting. Fortunately on tarmac roads it was almost impossible to conceal mines and drivers soon learnt to look out for them, but they had a certain delaying effect at night by slowing up traffic and making it necessary to burn headlights. A better control of explosives throughout the country might have reduced the number of mines, while some protective device underneath motor vehicles would have minimised their effect. Had it been permitted, the best deterrent would probably have been the carrying of hostages. All these forms of sabotage were generally committed during the night, and the main military problem therefore became one of keeping the road under observation during the hours of darkness. At first this was done by means of infantry patrols in lorries or by armoured cars; out the enemy soon spotted them as being suitable targets and arranged almost nightly ambushes, usually combined with a road block, from which he could open heavy fire at short range and rely upon darkness to ensure an easy retreat. These tactics ’soon led to the use of armoured vehicles only for patrols, but their small arms fire had little effect upon the rebels behind we 11 -p rep are d cover and something more nvasr^requi red. For a time the addition of rifle grenades to the equipment of the armoured cars sufficed, but later it was necessary to include gun lorries and searchlights in the patrols. But these proved to be an even more tempt ing bait to the- rebels, and led to what became almost nightly fire fights between strong rebel ambushes and elaborate road patrols. In most cases the ambushers depended upon their initial volleys to do the chief uainage and seldom waited after the first few rounds of gunfire, so that there were few casualties on either side as a result of these numerous night actions. There is little doubt that this development of the straightforward road patrol did result in the expenditure of too much force on the duties of road protection, though it certainly secured a fair degree of immunity for the road and the telephone lines. As a means 01 striking at the enemy it failed chiefly because it did not introduce -he element of surprise, which lay mostly with the enemy. In fact itwas not until sufficient troops became available to man a system of picquets that the saboteur began to run any real risks of having pay heavily for his actions. ng to Picquets were introduced with the principal object of pro tec 4 -in road traffic during daylight, but proved to be a very good deterrent against night sabotage in their vicinity. Some patrolling was still required, but could be made more irregular and in less strength where picquets had been established, while stalking parties on foot and cou f ambushes by infantry from the picquets did succeed in effecting some surprises and did at least ensure for the first time that when any fi r ' was opened on the road patrols the infantry attack could start from ^ behind the enemy. In fact one of the chief lessons of road protection was the necessity of placing protective troops in the vicinity of the * firing point and not of the butts. In the end therefore the best solution to the problem was the combination of picquets with irregular night patrolling by armoured cars; though to provide weak picquets on the very sparest scale used up to the equivalent of one battalion and this figure would have risen to two and a half had serious attacks on picquets ever been started. In addition to these measures an early morning patrol was required to detect sabotage committed during the night, and it was found that aircraft could do this quite effectively with the minimum of delay. The restriction of traffic to fixed hours of daylight would have been of great assistance by giving the military greater freedom of action at night, and oy ensuring that sabotage was detected and repairs effected Dc-fore traffic was released in the morning. Other civil measures which can assist in road protection include the declaration of a curfew zone on the road, the allocation of responsibilities fjmong villages, the severe p unishment of villages implicated in sabotage, and the provision of hostages to be carried in military vehicles. Road Traffic rioeta trailic was used so often as a bait with which to draw out armed bands and bring them to action that it is difficult to separate steps ^uken to protect it from those taken to inflict casualties on the enemy • ^ ^ Apart from road mines and intermittent sniping the chief threats to j Oe,.d traffic were deliberately planned daylight ambushes. Anbush -P ai v/0 ^ld consist of anything from seven to twenty men fairly widely scattei._al, who often wore black cloaks and when stationary were almost invisible at anything more than very short range.

Neither could be assured at night, which was an addi tional reason for the prohibition of night traffic, and the former required the institution of a convoy system and legislation to force all traffic to move only in convoy. Convoying of civilian traffic, though on a voluntary basis only, started at the beginning of the rebellion and was a responsibility of the police until the military assumed control on the 13th. May. Prom that date civil and military traffic travelling between the North and South was marshalled daily at about 1000 hours at Jerusalem, Affula and Kefr Saba (for Jaffa and Tel Aviv), whence it was conducted under military escort to a central meeting point at Deir Sharaf, the main road junction North of Nablus. There the vehicles in the three convoys were changed over so that the original escorts could return in charge to the same three starting points. A military courier service was run in conjunction with the system. At first, for the sake of convenience, escorts continued through to Deir Sharaf regardless of area boundaries but later owing to the variations of escorting methods of different commanders it was found preferable to confine responsibili ties within the bounds of the military areas. This led to certain waste of time, since an escort might have to wait an hour or two at the boundary before picking up the return convoy, but waiting escorts were always of value as a temporary picquet and served as a useful reserve when attacks occurred near the borders of two areas, as was often the case. These daily convoys naturally provided a tempting bait to the ambushers, and were used deliberately as one means of bringing uhem to action. For this purpose a Rodex vehicle was included in order to summon aircraft, while the land striking forces either followed at a short distance behind or - more often - stood by at convenient centres ready to answer 'GC' calls. Picquetting in Palestine was never close enough to permit of convoys travelling without escorts, and these were strengthened deliberately in order to lose no opportunity of pinning the enemy to his ground the moment he appeared. Gun lorries were therefore often included to hold the enemy in conjunction with automatic weapons until striking forces of aircraft and troops could reach the scene. The strength of any escort depended upon the intervals between picquets and the chances of encountering an armed band on che route. The smallest consisted of an advanced guard of one armoured car followe by a truck-load of troops, with a single armoured car as rearguard. The infantry were required to remove road blocks under cover o e armoured car’s fire and to guard the convoy when at rest. Where armoured cars were not available their place was taken by a true*, armoured if possible, in which an automatic weapon was moun e . firing. If necessary the advanced guard was increased by the addit of a machine gun lorry or a second truckload of troops or ° ^ ^ the rearguard by a gun lorry or machine-gun lorry or „ Since fire wae usually opened from the flank or rear rather than f rom the front it was better to keep the pinning weapons wc _ - column. In the main body of the convoy there was always a Ro vehicle, near the head but far enough back to minmise risk from mines, and one or more troop lorries or machine-gun Ioxj. res , intervals amongst the convoyed vehicles accoi ing o VO v.

The Rodex would send out its XX call, ioiiow44816-1 138 a GG- call, and ground strips would be laid down to indicate the 1 0Ca t• of the enen^y. While the combined efforts of the aircraft and the we ° n already in action on the road were pinning the enemy and inflicting ' POnS casualties, the military striking force on arrival would halt out of sight while the commander carried out his reconnaissance. After that all efforts would be concentrated on manoeuvring the striking force behind the enemy in order to encircle him and close. Meanwhile the advanced guard infantry, as soon as they had cleared a gap through the block, would lead the convoy through at speed beyond the danger area. Where there was no road block and heavy fire was opened, the°advanced guard 7/ould halt and give covering fire while the convoy drove on at speed with automatic weapons firing on the move to keep the enemy’s head down. If the fire was light - such as that of a few casual snipers - 5 there would be no halting of any vehicle, though the armoured cars and machine-gun lorries might 'spray” the hills on passing if any likely targets vrere visible. It may be worth recording that very' few casualties were ever caused among occupants of convoyed vehicles, though on a large number of occasions attacks upon convoys led to casualties being inflicted upon armed bands. The conclusion may therefore be drawn that military effort expended upon convoying was amply justified. RAILWAY PROTECTION General In Palestine sabotage on the railway had some important differences from that on the roads. As a rule attacks on the roads were serious only when they were directed against the traffic using them, whereas on the railway rebel efforts were concentrated upon the line itself as being the best way of damaging the trains and' their occupants. Pew sections of the line ran through hill country suitable for ambushes, an' provictuc who line remained intact the speed of a train alone was a e l u a e protection against fire attacks. The saboteur therefore aimed o mllict damage by means of derailments, which were of course far more sa is aci,oiy from his point of view than the mere killing or Passengers in a passing train. As a consequence the • In ^“ 1 e or ^ 1 “ ;as directed to the prevention, detection and re pair ol sabotage of the permanent way.

(*) Lydda to Haifa. 70 miles. (c) Lydda to Jerusalem. 41 miles. (a) Lydda to Tel Aviv. 11 miles. (e) 44- kilos of line between Haifa and Acre. 3 miles. (f) Haifa to Samakh. 55 miles. Total 242 miles. The main communication with Egypt. The only alternative to the road through Nablus. Required for the carriage of vital supplies for Jerusalem which could not easily be transferred to road traffic. Required for the carriage of vital supplies for Tel Aviv. Communications with railway workshops. The 105 cm. feeder line to the Hedjaz Railway providing communication to Damascus, the maintenance of which was essen tial to French interests. Of these only the first two received military protection until after the first reinforcements had come safely through from Egypt, when protection was extended to the remaining sections. Fortunately most of the rail- way followed the plains through mainly Jewish areas, which eased defence and at the same time gave the Jews themselves a chance of participating in it. The Rafa-Lydda-Haifa line entered Palestine in desert country, changed North of Gaza to orange groves and cultivation, and kept to the coastal plain the whole way. From Lydda to Jerusalem the railway followed level ground as far as Artuf, where it started the steep climb up into the hills winding its way through deep gorges flanked with rocky hillsides. The line from Lydda to Tel Aviv was on level ground through out. The narrow gauge line ran level as far as Beisan and then entered the low hill system which forms the western border of the Jordan Valley. The Railway Staff . The Headquarters of the Palestine Railways was located in ^he Station buildings at Haifa and the main workshops a few miles outside. ^ Lydda was the most important junction and acted as headquarters tor the southern district. All stations were linked by the railway technical control telephone system which was not in connection with the ordinary civil system. Organization was very centralized and all movements on the line were controlled from Haifa. The effect of this organization upon the military arrangements was to necessitate one central authority at Haifa to control the operation of such tactical units as patrol trains, trolleys, armoured trains etc. which used the line, since it was at Haifa alone that traffic over the whole system could be viewed at one time. It was however possible to decentralise below to two units or formations base upon Haifa and Lydda and responsible respectively for the protection of the lines to the North and South of Lydda. Outside the Headquarters, railway employees could be dividud among the Platelayers* Organization, the Repair and Maintenance Staffs at Haifa and Lydda, the Station Staffs along the line, and the Train Crews Of the platelayers, who were almost exclusively Arabs, more will be said later. The repair and maintenance staff at Haifa was a mixture o44816-1 140 Jews and Arabs; that at Lydda nearly all Arabs reinforced by Royal Engineers who dealt mainly with derailments and similar emergencies Arabs again - except in those stations, serving purely Jewish districts - supplied the station staffs and lived on the premises. Train crews were Arabs mixed with some Egyptians and a few Jews, together with a strong backing of R.N. and R.E. personnel who would have been sufficient to maintain a limited service for strict essentials without the aid of the Arab staff had this ever been necessary. The short line from Lydda to Tel Aviv was operated at night throughout most of the rebellion by the 42nd Field Company, R.E. Fortunately the railway employees remained at work throughout, except for the period of the brief railv/ay strike in August which followed 'Black Hand' activities at Haifa, and there is no doubt that for the most part they remained loyal in spite of intense intimidation and perhaps some degree of sympathy with the rebels. There were certainly cases of sabotage in which the expert hand could be detected and not every worker was above suspicion, but on the whole the railway staff, provided they received adequate protection, continued loyally to carry out their duties under the greatest difficulties, and they deserve full recognition. Most of the employees (except plate layers) lived on railway premises and formed a small community of their own which made their protection from intimidators somewhat easier, while this semi-isolation undoubtedly helped to strengthen the very high esprit de corps which already existed and which was mainly responsible for holding the railwayman together throughout the rebellion. The Platelayers were perhaps the vital link in the chain, being difficult to replace and rather more exposed to danger than the other workers, while it was through their efforts alone that the worst effects of sabotage could be avoided. It was in fact their success in detecting and repairing sabotage on the permanent way which made them targets for the worst violence and intimidation, and their protection by troops was therefore a necessary step in obtaining security for rail traffic. It was complicated by the fact that the platelayers were widely scattered, living in gang posts some ten kilometres apart in parties of about ten under a Ganger (Foreman) and spending most of their time 'walking the line' for inspection purposes. Attacks on the Railway Attacks were directed either against employees, trains, or the permanent way with its stations, bridges, v/orkshops, telephones and signals. At first sabotage was carried out principally at night, but later tended to become more prevalent by day. The protection of workers necessitated the guarding of the areas where they lived and worked and the provision of escorts when they left protected areas for duties along the line. Ibr most of these tasks it was necessary to employ troops, although in many cases Supemumaiy Police were^ adequate as station guards. Fortunately little protection was required for the railway area at Haifa, but at Lydda a well lit and guarded perimeter had to be preserved. At both places reserves were held to accompany breakdov/n parties, while protection for the platelayers involved the distrioution of troons in pemanent way detachments through out the system. Attacks on trains, apart from attempts at derailment, were confined to sniping and the throwing of occasional bombs. Neither did more than cause some intimidation of passengers and train crews, but nevertheless necessitated travelling escorts of a few soldiers or police to give confluence. Aircraft were often used to escort trains through sections where sniping was most frequent and generally proved to be a complete _ preventive. Derailments were often heavily sniped, and required special44816-1 141 Sabotage of the permanent way was of course the greatest problem. The simplest form of line obstruction consisted of stones and rocks piled on one rails by local inhabitants, while more serious were mines of the same type as those used on the roads. Both were easy to detect and took time oo instal but called for patrols (sometimes of aircraft) to loccioe them oefore orpins i/vere allowed to pass. Even more pre valent and much more dangerous 'was the practice of loosening the snikes and fishplates, which was practically impossible to detect on the move and resulted in the train spreading the track and becoming derailed. -his needeo. shilled men vitn special tools but there appeared to be no lack oi either, and there was evidence that in daylight this form of sabotage could be completed within ten minutes. Here detection was almost all that was necessary, since repair could be effected just as quickly, bu^ it needed much closer patrolling and a system of piloting trains. Attempts to blow up railway bridges were sufficiently serious to necessitate the guarding of all those which were both easy to destroy and aiiiiculu to repair. In most cases Supernumary Police supplied the guards, and there was no instance in which more than 24 hours’ delay resulted from sabotage of a bridge. Passive defence measures might have been effective at the other bridges, but those which were left without guards were either easy to repair or were so difficult to damage seriously that patrols might well be relied upon to intercept saboteurs before they could complete their labours. The Development of the System of Railway Protection ' ' ■ ■■■ ■■ ■■■■ ■ . ■ ■■ ■ — The needs of railway protection are perhaps best illustrated by a brief description of the way in which they developed in Palestine and the measures which w r ere devised to meet them. Up to the end of May the only military protection which could be given was the provision of some infantry guards and patrols detailed by area commanders, together with patrolling by railway inspection vehicles under military protection. Night running was stopped in most cases and speed limits enforced to minimise the effects of undetected sabotage, while a curfew zone was imposed during the hours of darkness over a strip of 100 yards on either side of the line. A force of some 35 Supemumary Police and 93 G-haffirs. . under regular police supervision and assisted by a few military guards, locked after the principal vulnerable points and kept watch over 17 important bridges. They were distributed in posts of three and armed with shot-guns. The arrival of the 42nd Field Company, together with six armed trolleys, later increased to twelve, manned by an officer and 26 men of the Royal Horse Artillery, enabled the system of military protection to be carried a stage further on the 25th.May. Responsioility tor patrolling the line was then divided between the area commanders at Haifa and Sarafand, each of whom drew up a nightly programme oi patrols in consultation with the local railway authorities. In the North patrolling units consisted of two of the Railway Company’s Drewrp cars based on Haifa and two locomotive units, one at Haifa and one at Samakh, each being manned by a section of infantry. In the South ^were the six R.H.A. trolleys, a Drewry car at Lydda and a locomotive unit at Jerusalem. As a precaution against accidents bridge guards etc. were issued with identity discs and armbands and instructed when they heard a patrol unit approaching to go inside their tenos, at each which the patrol would stop en route, A great increase in sabotage soon made more intensive measures imperative, and on the 6th June military area commanders were relieved of the responsibility of railway security. Instead a o^ ^ ^ Communication Headquarters” was opened in the railway offices -^-aifa- under a Lieutenant-Colonel with a small staff; and tne 2nd „n The Cheshire Regiment together with R.H.A. and R.E. personnel Wao pl^ce44816-1 142 under his command. His responsibilities were limited within the boundaries of land owned by the Railways, which gave him the ta^k looking after the permanent why but not of preventing rebels from ° f firing upon it, ^he lacker rems.ined ohe care of the area commands' so long as they operated from Outside the narrow strip of crmn-na rS flanking the line. ^ a By July it had become necessary to add considerably to the Sure- numary Police guards on bridges and railway stations, and the South/' Area commander had found it necessary to establish picquets to nrev/+ sniping of the line between Artuf and Jerusalem. At the end of th/ month the 8 th Hussars at Gaza started to use car patrols to assist thp Che shires, and at the same time six anti-aircraft searchlights were distributed between Gaza and Tulkarm. On the 8 th August a most successful innovation was introduced, whereby light Ford V .8 pilot trolleys were run in the same section ahead of passenger trains in daylight. Meanwhile two naval armoured trains had been put into commission, and in early September an additional company of infantry was placed under the L, of C.

The protection of trains should be ensured automatically if the permanent way is properly protected, but certain additional precautionary measures will also be advisable. No night running should be permitted and the train schedules must be arranged to give time for inspection vehicles or platelayers patrols to sweep the line at dawn and for the results of night sabotage to be repaired before trains enter the danger areas. ^ight trafxic only offers the enemy a chance of cheap success, since sabotage will seldom be detected in the dark and offensive action is not likely to be effective. A pilot trolley, running some two miles in front of a train will be needed as a precaution against quick daylight sabotage, but ic is important that armoured trains, locomotive patrol units ^ etc. should not be used for this purpose as their own derailment will in itself produce a serious obstruction. Military train guards ought not to be required: the train crews may need strengthening by technical troops, but the personal safety of the passengers will best be left to a small police escort. So far as the permanent way is concerned it is as well to recognise from the start that sabotage cannot be prevented and that any attempt to do so by force of arms will lead to a waste of military effort. The object should be to secure adequate protection for the really vulnerable points, and for the rest to provide some form of deterrent and depend on rapid detection and repair to reduce the effects of sabotage that has occurred. The following analysis of railway sabotage in Palestine in 1936 (excluding sniping or attacks by fire alone) will show that even with a skeleton protective system a fair degree of immunity can be given to the most vulnerable points Interference with the railway line itself 308 cases Interference with the telephone system 125 M Attacks on stations and other installations 10 M Attempts to destroy bridges 47 M Acts of violence against railway workers (x) 50 w Acts of violence against passengers (x) 7 w (x) Apart from those incidental to a derailment. As a dete r rent against night sabotage patrols on foot, v/orking by ''surprise 1 ' methods, undoubtedly achieved the most success, while in the daytime the ordinary platelayers' escorts served as additional foot patrols. Patrolling in railway vehicles of various kinds was useful us a means of economising in personnel but should be confined entirely to daylight. It was found that patrolling by vehicles required at the most one fourth of the men necessary for the sparsest system of picquets- and-foot-patrols; but it had the gravest disadvantages at night, since • the vehicle patrol itself was liable to fall an easy victim to sabotage in the dark and as a rule could only detect it by its own sacrifice. A final lesson concerns the command of railway protection troops. The system adopted in Palestine of placing them all under one independent command gave good results; but it was never popular with the area commanders, who still remained responsible for stopping sniping of the railway but who had none of the railway troops at their disposal. The best system of command must of course depend upon the method of pro tection adopted. Where protective troops are tied to the line itself through lack of numbers and have to patrol in railway vehicles, an independent commander who will be in close touch with the railway44816-1 144 authorities will be better able to control them. But where there are sufficient troops to hold the ground overlooking the line - by means of picquets etc. - they should uftdoubtedly be under the orders of the commanders of the areas in which they operate. In practice however a combination of both will usually be necessary; and in that case the infantry who patrol on foot or in road vehicles can remain under area commanders, while the technical troops who man railway vehicles and reinforce railway employees can be placed under a separate H 0 .C. Railway Troops”. A Summary of the Requirements of a System of Railway Protection To recapitulate, the conclusions arrived at above point to certain definite requirements of any system of railway protection which may be summarized as under :- (a) No rail traffic at night. (b) A system of posts throughout the line each manned by troops or by police according to local requirements, under the oonmand of military area commanders. Posts to be sited v/here they can command vulnerable points; and platelayers' gang posts to be located close to them. The garrisons to keep the line under observation during daylight and to supply platelayers escorts by day and permanent way patrols b y night. Patrolling to be done on foot or in motor vehicles off the railway line with the object of obtaining surprise. (c) Technical railway troops under an independent commander work ing in very close touch with the railway authorities. Railway troops to man line inspection vehicles and trolleys for daylight piioting, and to reinforce civil train crews and breakdown parties wnere required, at the same time learning the system with a view to operating it in the event of defection of the civil staff. (d) Military or police guards, under the area commanders, to protect railway centres, such as workshops, etc. not already covered by the permanent way posts, and to prevent the intimidation of their staffs. • ^ rregU } a f P° liGe at any points where the scale of attack is insufficient to Justify the use of troops.

Indict 1 the^ 0 ^ 1 ^ W ^° h 0an made e 'l ually . above could ^ 4 . reca P :L tfrlation of railway lessons give above could easily be adapted to suit either roads, telephone lines or44816-1 145 pipe-lines. To sum up, however, the following may be taken as the main lessons in the protection of all forms of communication:- (a) Repressive measures against those guilty, or even suspected, ot sabotage will be the best preventive. For this purpose legis lation and other action by the civil authorities will be necessary. (b) All forms of communications will have some vulnerable points where sabotage will have particularly serious consequences - such as pumping stations, telephone exchanges, bridges, railv?ay work shops &amp; etc. - and these will require permanent guards. (c) There will also be many vulnerable points of less importance where passive defence measures can be of use. (d) Over the rest of the system it will seldom be possible to pre vent sabotage at night, and to attempt to do so will only lead to waste of effort. Furthermore, night patrols on the actual line of the communications will always be at a disadvantage since they provide a good target for snipers and can seldom hit back with effect. The best deterrent will be patrols working by surprise methods on the flanks of the line. Good lighting of the communications will of course give great assistance. (e) By day the line of communications must either be observed by a series of posts or must be patrolled at frequent intervals. The line must be inspected at dawn before being opened to traffic, and repair parties must be escorted. (f) On the roads and railways military effort will best be expended in guarding the system rather than the traffic upon it, unless it is intended to use the traffic as a bait with which to bring the enemy to battle. Small escorts to traffic may be necessary but these -will be reduced to a minimum when traffic is confined to a fixed daylight schedule, starting only after the line lias been inspected and repaired where necessary. In the case of the roads this will necessitate conpulsory convoying. (g) Finally the ideal form of protection will be a series of posts covering vulnerable points on the line, the garrisons of which will provide:- (i) Surprise patrols as a deterrent against sabotage by night. (ii) Inspection patrols at dawn, and perhaps escorts for repair parties. (iii) Observation of the line during daylight. In addition technical troops - R. E. and R. Signals - will usually be necessary to reinforce and protect the civil staff, ihey will operate best under an independent commander who can work in close touch with the civil department responsible. This ideal will of course be expensive in troops, ^ and economies can be effected by using mechanical transport for duties (ii) and (iii). They will, however, always be at a great disadvantage at night, theref ore of reduced value for (i), and in any case if they are tie to the communications which they are del ending will always place their occupants at the target end of any attack and there y ^sen their chances of closing with the enemy.44816-1 146 CHAPTER 15 0FPSKSI7E ACTION GENERAL The objects of Offensive Action Offensive action was generally undertaken with one or more of thr objects in vieW:- (a) The capture of ams or of 'wanted” men. (b) The punishment of inhabitants of villages or town quarters. (c) The destruction of armed bands. All three of course overlapped considerably. A search for arms might often be carried out in order to act as a punishment in itself; while every type of offensive action had always the ultimate aim of bringing armed bands to action by making them fight to stop embarrassing activities on the part of the military. Thus the more troops could act offensively by moving constantly over the country searching villages and driving areas, the more chance they had of encountering the bands and ini dieting casualties upon them. Even activities of this kind which did not result in any contact with armed rebels did at least keep them on the run and at the same time made the inhabitants more chary of assisting them. The results of offensive action therefore cannot properly be assessed in numbers of arms captured, of arrests made, or even of casualties inflicted; but should be regarded more in the light of the cumulative effect over a period of time. If more troops had been released Irom static defence to act offensively and had they been able to make a freer use of their weapons from the beginning, there is no doub u that both the concrete results and the ultimate effect would have been very much greater. As it was the principal aim was never achieved, m tnat the rebellion closed with the main bands still intact and under armo, so that the 'subjugation of the hostile elements' was never in fact accomplished. _l e requ-Lrements of successful of fen s i ve ac t i o n The first of these requirements - as in the case of successful defensive action - was surprise, and in acting offensively there was r^ ner a better ^chance of securing it. But it needed every ounce of cunning, coupled with rigorous avoidance of anything resembling routine procedure, and a good knowledge of the habits of the enemy. Ibr instance the Arao liked to get his regular hours of sleep and would usually re l 111 ’ 10 '' 00n oer ^dnight, relying for the remainder of the night on ne village dogs to warn him of approaching danger. A cautious a yance snortiy before dawn therefore stood a good chance of catching villages off their guard, and furthermore forced any band to fight for the longest possible time before being able to cloak its retreat with usuall y 311 essential ingredient in rebel plans. In an open ig surprise could oest be effected by wide enveloping movements designed to take the enemy in the rear. He usually succeeded in slipping /ay m time to evade the force of a frontal or flank attack, but was of uen careless about covering his rear and even if the rear attack did retr^t^ e &gt; teGted - 1 u S ^ diSG0Very was often flayed long enough for the retreat to be punished heavily. &amp; ^44816-1 147 The second requirement, and quite the most difficult one to ensure, was good information. It is unnecessary to recount again all the difficulties which combined to maiie it so hard to obtain, but such were the workings of the Arab mind that the supply would generally be propor tionate to the offensiveness of the Government forces. So long as troops occupied a village the inhabitants would feel secure from intimi dation and might stc-irt to curry favour with their new masters by producing information. But of course once the troops had left the same villagers would be at pains to get back into the good books of the rebels, and for this reason it wno sometimes necessary to stay on in a village in order to prevent the rebels returning the moment the troops had gone to wreck vengeance on 'traitorous' inhabitants. It was most noticeable that once a strong line had been taken by the Government in September and large numbers of troops began to flow into Palestine, so the villagers - always anxious to be on the winning side - at last began to give sufficient information for deliberate operations to be planned. Prior to that, owing to the shortage of troops available for offensive action, good information was practically unknown and it was necessary to rely almost entirely upon chance encounters to produce a fight. The third, requirement was a matter of legislation which perhaps Martial Law alone can provide, and for the lack of which offensive opera tions in Palestine often failed to achieve the results which, from a purely military point of view, they probably deserved. -That was needed was some form of control over the civil population which would have enabled troops to detect strangers who were present in a village with no good reason, or equally inhabitants v/ho were absent from their homes without legitimate excuse. It would almost certainly have involved compulsory identification cards and perhaps measures to make all civilians sleep in their own homes unless given v/ritten permission to do otherwise. This admittedly would have been difficult to enforce, but was by no means impossible and would have been of incalculable value to the troops in their task of rounding up rebels. It would have done much to have removed their greatest problem, v/hich was to deal with armed men v/ho hid their arms on the approach of troops and posed as peaceful citizens of the nearest village to which they happened to be at the time. It would also have been a strong deterrent against sabotage by providing a means v/hereby absentees from a village could be apprehended on their return and called upon to provide an explanation of their movements during the previous hours. The difficulty of separating the genuinely peaceful fellahin from armed rebels v/ho had temporarily adopted that pose was in fact one of the greatest handicaps of all offensive operations. Night Operations Daylight may almost be classed as a fourth requirement of successful offensive action, since any engagement at night inevitably favoured an enemy v/ho was usually met behind good cover in a carefully chosen posi tion with a well-reconnoitred line of retreat behind him. ^ To carry ou offensive night operations of any extent v/as therefore to invite casua - ties from an opponent more at home in tne dark than the Bn is ^ r , whom night deprived of most of the advantages of his superior weapons. On the other hand darkness was a valuable ally to troops v/ho c ® u use it effectively to gain surprise, as in the staging of an ambuo ^ a patrol or in an approach march designed to place a cordon in posi ion e fore daylight. M.T. on the move at night v/as extremely vu nen xe an dispelled any hopes of secrecy by having to use some sort of ligr ts &gt; but night marches across countrv by both cavalry and infan ° useful, though in the hills tiring to both men and animals and denk. g a thorough knowledge of the ground. Pbr the latter purpose air p.n o- graphs were most valuable. With good moonlight however progress was nearly as fast as by day, fatigue from the heat was avoided, and goo chances afforded of finding the enemy asleep. Typical progress in a single night under such conditions over rocky country wi eep a44816-1 148 was six miles in about three hours, whereas without a moon five miles was a fair distance for a night's march on similar ground, and this would take about five hours to complete. It may tnerefore be concluded that night marches, particularly by moonlight, were sometimes usefulj but that offensive operations other than small ambushes and patrols were to be avoided during the hours of darkness. ACT ion to capture arms and wanted men The Problems of Disarmament No description of any action taken with a view to capturing arms can be complete without some reference to the special circumstances which had led to the very widespread possession of illegal arms by the civil popu lation. To the Arab the carrying of arms had always been a matter of prestige and personal dignity, while the lack of public security in Palestine both before and after the V/ar had often made them a practical need as well. Thus every Arab of standing did his best to maintain some sort of firearm for personal use without necessarily having any original intention of using it for aggressive purposes. The Jews too needed them even more for self-defence, and - not with reason perhaps - were not inclined to depend solely upon the small sealed armouries of shot-guns which were authorised for the protection of their colonies. Thus the majority of the civil population, on both sides, were at pains to secure as many arms as possible, and considerable numbers were held secretly by both Arabs and Jews. Illegal possession of arms was rendered all the more prevalent by the ease with which they could be obtained. The aftermath of the Great Wan had flooded the whole of the Near East with stocks of arms of all sorts, while various outbursts in Palestine as well as the Druse rebellion against the French in 1925 had opened up many opportunities for the pro fessional smuggler* Certain foreign nations too were not above suspicion of having given practical aid to the latter; while in Trans-Jordan and the desert region beyond it the carrying of arms was universal and without restriction and it was not difficult to pass them across an almost open frontier. Thus by various means the inhabitants had steadily been accumulating arms for years and when the rebellion opened they had been widely distributed in every village and hamlet throughout the length and breadth of the country. Not only were there large stocks of rifles and revolvers, but the Arabs had also plentiful supplies of explosives and machines for refilling and recapping cartridge cases. The Arab arms were mostly very inferior: many of them were wartime relics of various nationalities while others were of the primitive type familiar in all Arab countries. Pistols v/hich were easier smuggled, were usually of good quality, and there was also a smattering of modem weapons - including some half dozen light automatics - which had been filched from British, French or Iraqi sources. Ammunition was of even lower quality than the rifles, much of it being wartime stock unearthed from old dumps and perhaps refilled by home-made methods. Though smuggling did undoubtedly continue throughout 1936 the standard of weapons captured from the rebels points against the belief that there was an appreciable inflow of modern rifles. It is probably safe to assume that the greater proportion of the rebel arms were already in the country when the rebellion started, md that smuggling was confined chiefly to pistols and ammunition, apart from the personal weapons of Arabs from neighbouring countries who managed to pass undetected across the land frontiers.44816-1 149 Illegal aming of the population had in fact long reached the stage where nothing short of extensive operations by large numbers of troops and police, coupled with the strictest legislation, could have achieved any reasonable degree of disarmament. This had never been properly •attempted, and no serious effort had even been made to clear up the ammunition dimips of the Great War. To tackle the problem on a big enough scale would probably have necessitated a declaration of Martial Law, and might in itself have been sufficient at any time to have precipitated a rebellion. It was only natural that the Government should have hesi tated to go to such lengths in normal times; though there would of course have been advantages in wresting the initiative by making the rebels strike at a time chosen not by them but by the authorities. How ever in the absence of such action the rebellion started with large stocks of arms hidden all over the country in most ingenious ways. The Arab, who at all times is ever distrustful of his neighbour, had long become an adept at concealing his weapons and the country in which he lived offered him every facility. Arms were built into the mud walls of the houses or buried under the floors, -while wells, caves, holes in the ground or the pebbly beds of wadis anything up to 200 yards outside the villages provided excellent hiding places. The sanctity of Moslem womenfolk, whom British troops and police -were strictly forbidden to touch, was also exploited to the full in preventing discovery; in an emergency their voluminous clothing was a great asset in which to conceal weapons or to hide the tell-tale marks of recent digging, while for hiding arms on the move the village woman in her shapeless bundle was an extremely useful carrier. Prior to the arrival of the Emergency Force the numbers of troops available were never sufficient for any attempt at large scale disarma ment, but many individual search operations were undertaken with the object of capturing arms. In this they were largely unsuccessful, since the hiding places were good and the secrets well kept, but they had other uses as well. They were not pleasant experiences for the inhabitants and so had a certain punishment value, they aclea as a deterrent to the weaker elements, and offered a chance oi come:.ing one or two of the refugees from justice who lay hidden or resting in every village. ” Searches'* in general Search operations consisted either of the isolation and systematic searching of a village or town area or of the cordoning and driving of a country district. In either case substantial captures of arms coul never be expected unless there was good information, which was very rare; nor was there much chance of arresting 'wanted” men with no means in existence of 'calling the roll” to discover strangers and absentee inhabitants. Failing this the only adequate alternative was to round up all males over 16 years of age and remove them custody to . identified and interrogated by police experts at their leisure. Unfortunately circumstances in Palestine prev^n^ev i s , a ~- 1 \ nUhipvrt absence of information and village 'rolls' the searches seldom achieved their main objects. At first their punishment value was vmj i-^ but this disappeared almost entirely after the Govor^ent had issu^^ instructions early in June for a modification V a means they were being carried out.

Platoons would aim to reach their positions about an hour before dawn, and in the first stre^* of daylight would extend outwards to join up with those on the flsnks The coraon 'would then start to close in simultaneously on all sides. 3y this time aircraft would appear overhead and the armoured cars for tanks; which had escorted the road move of the column would move up to positions from which they could assist in the cordon. By this time the Vll ?; a , s - e r ' vould have 'been thoroughly aroused and the covering troops - prcbaoly one or two platoons - would enter and establish posts in command ing positions, most of which would be on the roofs of the houses.

They had a certain moral value, hut v/ere more often apt to drive armed bands to ground rather than force them to fight. Unless surprise was achieved it was so easy for rebels to hide their arms for the moment and pose as innocent citizens, that the bands were only likely to light if their prestige had reached such a very low ebb locally that no other course was left to them. This however was rarely the case as most Arabs readily appreciated when discretion was the better part of valour. The element of surprise was all the more difficult to obtain on account of the fact that area searches v/ere only permitted after due warning had been given to the district administration and the police. The value of area searches therefore lay more in their moral effect - which sometimes resulted in bringing in better information from villages which had been intimidated and robbed - than in any material gains. These searches were conducted almost exactly on the lines of ' Imperial Policing, 195 4', a cordon being formed to isolate the area while infantry columns moved slowly across it searching caves, hilltops and villages enroute, a slow tedious and extremely tiring procedure. Progress was so slow in the very difficult hill country that care was necessary to ensure that the depth of the drive was not beyond the physical capabili ties of the troops. An advance of ten miles in a single day was certainly the maximum which could be expected if caves and other hiding places were to be combed out. As regards frontages it is difficult to give any guide as of course they varied greatly on different sorts of ground and as it was seldom possible in Palestine to have troops as thick on the ground as might be wished. The ideal is probably not less than six to ten yards to a man, though admittedly this is seldom possible to ensure. In the absence of horsed cavalry drives had to be carried out almost entirely by infantry on foot moving on a wide front while the more mobile troops held the cordon. Resources were rarely sufficient to estaolish a standing cordon round the area, so that cordons usually took the form of a few posts at central points linked together by intensive patrolling of mobile troops. -for this purpose main roads v/ere usually chosen fo r the line ci the cordon, as the road picquets formed a useful framework on which to base it. &lt; On occasions the River Jordan was used for the purpose with i.u.F.i?. cavalry patrolling the banks betv/een infantry posts at the fords. A line of roads however offered a better chance of obtaining surprise, as troops in M.T. could move quickly and simultaneousl.v from suywial directions to their places in the cordon* To establish an efficient cordon for day and night purposes it was found that twenty yards to a man was a suitable frontage for a standing cordon of infantry, whereas A.F.V's. used on a moving cordon were effective on a front which ^ not exceed half a mile per vehicle. Local restrictions on opening made the work of cordon troops most difficult, though tho . c. ^u^on of a curfew zone on the roads used as the cordon Hue was a nc -P* ^ machine-guns of A.F.V’s. wore useful for checking Cr ?^.. line, since bursts of fire could bo put down in fron o p^op e to cross who might at first fail to halt when challengea owing o ignorance or an innocent tendency to run out of she^i righ • w generally necessary to establish the cordon in theaar &gt;. i-n _ ° ^ allow the longest possible period of daylight for the driving operations.

June the first definite information as to the str location and headquarters of the rebel bands reached Force HQ. Th * ^ were reported to be in the triangle of hill country between Nablus ^ Ramallah and Qalqilya, an area which had already proved to be the cent of most trouble. Being inaccessible to any sort of M.T. except in the 6 region of a few well-defined tracks, the villages had never been visit d by troops and had seldom seen either police or administrative officers They were by now thoroughly out of hand and offered a most suitable harbourage for the armed bands who operated against the railway to the South of Qalqilya and the main road between Ramallah and Nablus. It was clear that the time had come to beard the rebels in their den and to prove to the inhabitants of the area that their natural inaccessibility could no longer keep them beyond the arm of the Law. It was clear from the start that the size of the area was such as to require the greater part of the whole Force, the infantry strength of which was then seven battalions. Unfortunately however the Southern Brigade was already committed to the fourth phase of the operations in the Old City of Jaffa, which took place on the 29th. and 30th. June, so that there was little chance of starting the drive much before the 2nd. July. Even then a^ further delay of 48 hours occurred, which is referred to below, so that the evening of the 5th.July was eventually chosen for the start*of Operation X”. At this time the armed bands had not yet reached the stage at which they would fight if they could possibly avoid it, and the A.0.0. fully realised that the chances of bringing them to action were^small - especially after a week's delay. Nevertheless it still remained essential to restore order and the prestige of Government in ^- rea &gt; so that plans were drawn up for a thorough search to be made bj- iour battalions over a period of two or three days. S&lt;jcrec^^ //as plainly essential if there was to be any chance of surprising the bands; and secrecy proved to be extremely difficult to obtain m spite of every effort to secure it.

The plan of action was based upon information that two bands, each some 150 to 200 strong, were living in the area and making use of known tracks to descend from their hill fastnesses upon the railway to the West and the main North-South road to the East. Their bases and areas of operation are shown in yellow on Map No. 3. The nor them-most band was said to be commanded by an ex-Officer from Syria and to be based on caves near Kafr Thulth, whence it operated westward towards the rail way below Qalqilya. The southern band was believed.-to be centred on Farkha and to operate against both the railway and the road: its commander was thought to be an ex-Officer from Trans-Jordan. The area of their activities was contained in a rectangle bounded by motor- able roads measuring some 17 miles on the north, east and south sides and narrowing to 10 miles on the west. It was bisected by a fifth motor- able track which ran East and Y/est from Huwwara to Has el Ein, and which was used as the inter-brigade boundary (marked in black on Map No. 3). It was known that the enemy used tracks running along the beds of certain wadis, and in fact so difficult was the country that movement away from these w adis was well-nigh impossible to friend and foe alike. The troops detailed to take part in the operation were distributed as under Northern Brigade Southern Brigade (Brig. A.3. Beauman, DSO.) (Brig. F. Keith Simmons, MVO.MC.) 1 Loyals. 1 Seaforth. C.Coy, 6 R. Tanks. Three and half sections of R.A.F. Armoured Cars. 8 Hussars. 2 Camerons. 2 Bedfs Herts. Two sections of R.A.F. Armoured Cars. The 2nd Field Coy. R.E. was held in HQ.

At the^same time Northern and Southern Brigade Headquarters opened respec ..xv r ej.,&gt; at Al Funduq and Jamma'in. Zero v/as the 5th. July, the daj following the full moon which was an important factor in the cnoice. Each Brigade was accompanied throughout by a civil administrative oificer, a^police officer and an R.A.F. Special Service Officer, while police guides and interpreters v/ere distributed among units. The plan of operations was divided into two pnases: -ne night phase which was to be concluded by midnight on Zero Day and which con sisted of the cordoning of the area and the seizure of certain tactical points, and the day phase which comprised a drive inwards from East and West starting at dawn on Z plus 1 Day. The positions to be reached in the night phase and the lines of advance during tne o o ,&gt;arL e&gt; „ shown in red and green respectively on Map No. 3. No —0'v e ° o „ normal stations, except those of headquarters, were «.o ^ e ore dark, on Z day, and the cordoning of the area was to begin a, ziOO hrs. The Northern Brigade road cordon of tanks and armoured cars was o extend from Ras el Ein through Qalquilya to Al Funduq, a distance ox some 18 miles, while two infantry cordons were to be establisned on the lines Al Funduq-Deir Istya and An Nabi Elyas - Mas-ha with a view oblocking the wadis against the return of rebels who had been operaf during the night on the road and railway. The Southern Brigade us^ the 8 th Hussars and armoured cars, was to establish a cordon on the of roads from Huwwara to Ein Sinya, and thence via Abud to Al Muzeir' 6 a frontage of 47 miles. In addition the Southern Brigade was to s by 2000 hrs. a hill North-West of Saif it which was known to be used^^ the enemy as a signal station, and to surround Salfit and Farkha bv ,71 night. In addition they were also to block certain wadi entrances t ' catch returning rebels. By 2000 hrs. the Southern Brigade infantry ° columns which were to drive the area next morning were to be in ^ position at the points where the various wad is debouched Onto the Nablus-Ramallah road. At first light the following day the Northern Brigade was to start an exhaustive search of all wadis and caves in its area, paying special attention to the neighbourhood of Kafr Thulth. Simultaneously the Southern Brigade, with the Camerons working from the East and the Bed fords from the West, was to sweep inwards towards the centre of their area searching en route with particular regard to the neighbourhood of Farkha. Reconnaissance aircraft were to co-operate and were to be prepared if necessary to drop food, water, ammunition and medical stores on isolated detachments in answer to improvised ground signals. The Air Striking Force was to stand by at Ramleh at immediate call. All went according to plan and by midnight on the 5th. most of the troops had reached their allotted positions without opposition, although some of the cross-country moves in the dark took much longer than had been anticipated and several columns had the greatest difficulty in recog nising their objectives, both maps and guides being equally uncertain in some cases. ^ Force HQ. and the two Brigade HQs. had been the first to f et in P osltlon Just before dark, and an hour or so later the cordon troops moved out followed by the infantry battalions in motor transport. Long before midnight the whole countryside seemed alive with troops and few Arabs ventured outside their homes. By the early hours of the mornmg Force HQ. had been linked by telephone to both Brigades, a lineq C h!Snn ? a ^ hleVTn ^ n '! : in the absence of any signal section, the of . ^ f. ai ^ nand in the dark over difficult ground by personnel wLn fh, R^ Sn S 1S P ermanent lin e detachment.

Just before dark tne opportunity was uanen to round up all the men of these villages and compel them to watch a demonstration either of mortar fire or of airci ai t dropping uv,- lb. bombs by the dive method. It was hoped that sucn demonstrations would nave a salutory effect by showing what mi^ht happen to their own villages in certain eventualities. The Arabs evinced close interest in the proceedings, but it must be admitted that on the v/hole they displayed lar less awe than delight in watching a good explosion - always a joy to any Arab. The majority of the- cordon troops also concentrated that night; the remainder of which passed peacefully except for severe sniping of a ration convoy on its way to Nablus - outside the area of operations - which resulted in the death of one Seaforth Highlander and the severe wounding of a R.A.S.C. Officer. The following morning the A.O.G. decided to conclude the operation, and during the day the troops returned to their camps. Operation X provided several useful lessons for the future. It showed that a ’'drive' could not bring to action armed bands which were prepared to hide until the operation was over unless they could be either surprised or cornered. The need for strict secrecy to obtain surprise and the great difficulty of achieving it therefore provided the first lesson. To corner the bands it was evident that a slower advance and a far greater number of troops was required to comb an area of the size selected for the operation; there was no doubt that both the front ages and the depths of the drive were too ambitious for the forces available, and equally that the cordon was too attenuated. On the credit side may be placed a certain loss of prestige which the bands must have suffered by refusing to fight - though this factor could not be rated too high in the light of Arab mentality - and the very far-reachin moral effect of a strong display of force in regions where any visible representation of authority had seldom been seen. Time was to show how very long this impression lasted; and the best testimonial to the value of Operation X lay in the fact that the area involved, after being one of the worst in all Palestine, ceased to give further trouble for the rest of the rebellion and for long after it. PUNITIVE ACTI ON General Punitive action took the form of punitive searches on the lines already described, of the establishment of punitive police posts,^the imposition of collective fines, and the demolition oi houses. -lie last is of most interest from a military point of view, and the only ^ one which need be enlarged upon in these pages. ^he punitive police posts consisted of supernumerary police installed for a iixed period at the expense of the inhabitants of the village or area concerned. ^ In practice the effect was little more than that of a fine owing to tne fact that the police chosen to man the post were invariably Arabs who44816-1 156 naturally displayed little activity in combatting rebellious activities of their own compatriots. The effect of a really strong post of Jewish Supernumeraries in an Arab village would have been very diff -. indeed, but this was never tried. The collective fines were of valii provided the amount was big enough to have a really punitive effect ^ provided its collection was al ways enforced. It was also necessary t make sure that it was not beyond the capacity of the people to pay ° In Palestine fines were too often never collected in full or were s^r over such a long series of instalments that their punitive effect was scarcely felt. Some villages openly refused to pay, and in these cases it was necessary to confiscate goods to the value of the fine task which usually required the aid of troops. As neither horses * cattle or grain was allowed to be seized in payment it was not easy to assess values, and too often villages escaped with the surrender of a ramshackle collection of furniture and household goods which were probably missed far less than the cash. There is no doubt that to be effective fines must be collected immediately in cash (or perhaps on occasions even in arms), if cattle and grain is to be exempted, and sentences of imprisonment inflicted in cases of refusal. Demol i tion s Demolitions were a military task alone, though police advice was usually sought as to which houses were to be demolished. A certain amount of demolition was of course carried out for purely tactical reasons, and in such cases compensation was paid, but it is however punitive demolitions wnich are more the concern of this chapter. In such cases the buildings chosen were either those from which fire had be^n detected or those which were known to have harboured rebels in active opposition to the forces. In the selection police dogs played an important part by identifying houses which had been occupied by the enemy In many cases Sappers were summoned at once and the demolition carried out immediately; while in other cases it was often sufficient to mark a house for destruction, by daubing it with large circles of IL ^ e P a: j- n ^&gt; 311 d to withold the actual demolition until such time as fur- +.] n e:r ? un ^ s ^ imG;ri ^ ^ )ecainG necessary. Demolitions were then conducted on the lines of the procedure described in Appendix XVII. By far the iggest operations of this nature ever carried out in Palestine were the series of actions against the Old City of Jaffa in May and June 1936, and be worthy of fuller description as a fair sample of the methods ■j. opoe or subduing an urban area which had got completely out of hand and where every form of law and order had ceased to exist.

Built upon a low hill flanked on one side by the sea, it completely dominated the Port and such buildings as the police station and barracks and the District Commissioner's offices, which lay in the New City. Moreover its houses formed a veritable rabbit warren through which dark and narrow streets turned and twisted into a maze in which the level of one street would often be the roof of the houses in the one below and where few passages were so wide that they could not be spanned by the reach of a man's arms. It represented in fact an exceedingly complicated trench system with vertical sides some thirty to forty feet high, which could readily be converted into a regular citadel. It was into this citadel that the tougher elements of Jaffa retired at the end of April when the police and troops had driven them off the streets of the New City, where they had struck the first blows of the rebellion on the 19th. Once inside they barricaded the narrow entrances, covered all approaching roads with nails and broken glass, and settled down to a campaign of sniping and bombing from what they fondly believed to be an impregnable stronghold. By early May all municipal services had ceased to function in the Old City and its surroundings and the town was rapidly reaching an indescribable state of filth, while rifle fire and bomb throwing was directed continually on all parts of the town dominated by the commanding situation of the Old City. All form of authority was in fact completely defied, and no political or police officer could hope to enter the tortuous alleyways without assassination. It was evident that stringent action to reduce the place and restore some semblance of order could no longer be delayed, especially as it was known that success in this direction would strike a severe blow at the very heart of the rebellion. ¥hat was more it would break the rebel domination of the Port of Jaffa and give the authorities their chance of re-opening it by means of black leg labour. It was thought that such action would force the lightermen to return to work rather than see their means of livelihood disappear completely, and this might well have succeeded in breaking the G-eneral Strike altogether. The chances were all the greater in view of the feverish efforts being made by the Jews to complete the jetty at Tel Aviv in time to profit by the situation in Jaffa. Once its trade had been diverted to Tel Aviv there was little chance of Jaffa ever recover ing it, and in fact a continuance of the lightermens' strike bore every resemblance of sheer suicide. In drawing up military plans to deal with this situation there seemed at first to be two fairly obvious courses, but unfortunately circumstances were to prevent either being put into practice. ihe first was to force an entry into the city and search it thoroughly with troops: this would certainly have been strongly opposed and would have led to heavy casualties on both sides in the sort of trench fighting which would have had to follow. Moreover it would have needed con siderably more troops than were available at the time. ^ The other course was to blockade the city and reduce it by siege m which inhabit ants would only be allowed to leave by surrendering themselves to the police, and which would have continued until a fixed number of firearms had been given up. This alternative had the obvious disadvantage of being far too lengthy, and would also have caused a good deal of dis tress among the women and children and other innocent inhabitants, which the civil government were most anxious to avoid. A third course had therefore to be adopted, and the plan whicn was eventually approved comprised four phases :- Phase 1. A retaliatory shoot against those houses from which fire had teen directed, to continue nightly until opposition had ceased.44816-1 158 P hase 2 . The clearing of the approaches and cleaning up of the town by forced labour. Phase 5 . The driving of a road through the Old City from East to ’Test by means of demolitions. Phase 4. The driving of a similar road to run North and South in a crescent shape. Preparations for the first phase were made with the greatest care and occupied several days. Houses from which snipers were operating were marked down and Vickers guns laid on them, while warnings were issued as to the action that would be taken if opposition continued. All was ready by the night of the 30th May, when the usual sniping and bombinn- continued as heavily as ever. The retaliatory shoot began at once with Vickers guns and rifle grenades, and was answered hotly with a con siderable volume of fire from a variety of weapons, including some automatics. Opposition did not last very long, and the moment it ceased the retaliatory shoot was stopped. The effect was conclusive and no repetition was necessary. How many casualties were caused will probably never be known, but it was very clear that the shoot had had a profound impression on Jaffa, and for nearly three .weeks afterv/ards the inhabitants gave little signs of trouble. Phase 2 was undertaken very shortly afterwards without opposition and with complete success. Troops and police rounded up all available effendis, shopkeepers and householders in the affected area and compelled them to assist municipal workers in clearing up the outskirts of the Old City. Order was soon restored and henceforward this was maintained, the rebel elements now emg driven into their inmost keep in the very centre of the Old City, here however they started later on to renew their old activities and. after the arrival of the 15th Infantry Brigade, it was decided to proceed with Phase.3. On the 16th June warnings were issued by means of leaflets dropped from aeroplanes, by town-criers etc. calling upon the inhabitants of the Old City to evacuate their homes by 7 o'clock in the evening to enable demolitions to take place, which were described by the Government as being 'for the improvement of the Old City'. Compensation was promised to the owners of property demolished. At the last moment it became necessary to postpone the operation for another day owing to some uncertainty regarding an alleged mosque in the path of the proposed ^uuo itions^which led to a realignment in deference to Moslem scruples. ° Vening of ^ he 17 the Headquarters of the Southern Brigade ^ ^ Bedfs.

Meanwhile the inhabit- ents ol Jaffa formed up in interested but rather sullen groups behind ^ * GordGn t° watG h the proceedings, quite evidently overawed by the 1 er o roops in view. By 1800 hrs. the demolitions were completed, a clear space some 10 metres in width had been driven straight through44816-1 159 t,.ne cli-j, arid D,y dark all troops had been withdrawn. The tanks held in I’eserve^xiad not been needed, and ho. 6 (b) Squadron R.A.?., v/hich had been^ carrying out continuous reconnaissance to the East of Jaffa through out me d;.y, xiad not detected any movements which might have suggested an aticjL.pl at ouosiae interference. During the subsequent v/eeks civil and convict labour was employed to clear the debris in'the path of the demolitions and start work on the road, while on the 29th and 30th June Phase 4- wa.s completed without incident. A similar plan was adopted as for Phase 3 and the same troops were employed, the demolitions forming the fiis.v step towards the construction of the North and South circular road. The Military action taken against Jaffa proved to be entirely successful. No further opposition from that quarter was ever encountered afterwards, and the existence of good wide roads through the old laby rinth of alleys will prevent the Old City ever being used again for the purpose to which it was put by the rebels in the first months of the rebellion. Except for the retaliatory shoot the whole operation was conducted without casualties on either side, and provides a good illustration of a means of reducing a recalcitrant urban area by the most humane means. Its success had a very far-reaching effect through out the whole country and may well be said to mark the end of organised resistance in the towns. Prom June onwards the main rebel activities were transferred to the hills there to be conducted on the lines of guerrilla warfare by the armed bands, offering to the troops at last a genuine military objective for offensive action. O FFENSIVE ACTION AGAINST ARMED BANDS Characteristics of the Bands By the time the bands had reached their full strength, the rebel forces in arms in Palestine were composed of contingents of Palestinians, Syrians, Iraqis, Druses and Trans-Jordanians. These contingents were always under arms and were concentrated in bands in various parts of the country. In addition the numerous villagers who possessed rifles formed an auxilliary force which could be called upon to supply recruits for the bands or to harass troops independently. For the most part the rebels fought on foot, though some contingents included small bodies of mounted men and at least one mule train v/as used to carry supplies and ammunition. They were well served by spies who moved freely in the vicinity of military camps etc. while the entire population stood firm in withholding information from the authorities. The strength of the bands is difficult to estimate v/ith any accuracy as so mang ol heir adherents were villagers who wore not always 'under arms cuu who remained at call in their villages during intervals of fighting. Local opinion credited the organized bands v/ith some 1500 rifles and me auxiliaries with twice that number, v/hile frequent stores reacnec. the authorities of volunteers streaming into Palestine from over the Syrian Dordur and across the desert from Iraq. It was found on investigation that these reports were invariably exaggerated, and io is probably t-u^ reputed strengths were also far above the truth. The most reliable estimate placed the number in the regular bands at 670, and even tnis may nave erred on the generous side. The real number of auxiliaries cannot be computed, but it may be taken that most villages supplied thorn five oO fifteen riflemen, depending upon their size and locality, wmle the large ones probably contributed upwards ol hiir The supreme commander of these bands was the ex-Iraqi officer, ?ausi al Qawaqji, who led a personal following oi .raqis anu^s ^led himself the 0 leader of the Arab revolt m i - or them Palestine . The44816-1 160 chief of the Syrian volunteers came next in importance, followed by an old freebooter of the Palestine hills who led the local bands. Fauzi's usual headquarters was in a village North of Nablus which was conveniently placed, for the receipt of arms from Syria via the Samakh neighbourhood or from brans--Jordan along unobtrusive routes: it also offered an out let of escape across the Jordan if necessary. From this base and arsenal Fauzi would move out from time to time to two or three selected villages which were better placed for staging attacks on communications but which were rather too near the roads to be healthy for long occupation. Certain villages in different parts of the country also served as collecting centres for arms smuggled over the frontiers or landed on the coast. In the arms traffic hashish smugglers, v/ho knew the secret routes and good hiding places, played a large part. The best arms and ammunition, apart from a certain number of recent Iraqi Army stock, were reputed to be those from Syria, of which the rebels were thought to receive a steady supply. The bands remained steadfastly in the hills v/hich formed their natural fighting ground and which facilitated their guerrilla tactics. There alone they had superior mobility, they v/ere on familiar ground and knew equally v/ell the covered approaches to the main communications and the tracks v/hich offered the best ways of retreat. In the hills in fact they felt that they could take as much or as little of the fighting as they pleased. They were credited from time to time with intentions of descending into the plains to attack Jewish settlements, but little more than long range sniping was ever attempted and it is probable that it was a fear of exposing themselves in open country to attack by aircraft and mobile troops that was the chief factor in keeping them on the hills. The bands preferred to stage attacks on troox^s and convoys in the afternoon, knowing that' the troops could seldom keep contact after dark and v/ere usually withdrav/n at dusk. The rebels could thus place a limit on any engagement, and could make good use of the withdrawal of troops under heavy sniping just before dark to establish a o.laim of , *victory ,, , an opportunity of which they took the fullest advantage. A fair sample of the better type of band is afforded by the group shown in Photograph No. 2, which is composed chiefly of Iraqis and Syrians. Most of these foreign elements had had some military service and X30ssessed a rough knowledge of tactics: they would fight in groups of five to seven men moving under the cover of fire from other sections. Movement would often be controlled by whistle, and retirements seemed to be carried out on a pre-arranged plan. They made good use of cover, and followed up rapidly when troops withdrew. They were capable of putting up a good resistance in defence and could carry out an ordered retreat, but like most Arabs shov/ed little inclination to advance in an attack and x^referred to depend upon fire action alone from behind good cover. Against aircraft the rebels develox)ed a good line of tactics as a result of experience: the parties being attacked would take cover immediately without attempting to reply, while others who were not under attack would engage the aeroplane with a steady and well-directed fire which was often successful in finding its target. The fighting ability of the Palestinian F ell ah v/hile below that of the foreign elements, surpassed expectation. Although inexperienced, he shov/ed himself courageous and undeterred by heavy losses. His arms and ammunition were inierior and his marksmanship indifferent, but he was an adept at bandit” uactics being a skilled ambusher and a genius at disappearing at the right moment. As a rule the bands were skilful in staging attacks under the conditions most favourable to themselves, and v/ere careful to seek out the weaker spots as their objectives. For instance convoys v/ere chosen to begin with until the protective arrangements were strengthened,161 44816-1 when attention was turned more to troops in the process of occupying or evacuating pacq^aets. But perhaps the chief of all enemy characteristics was .he universal reluctance to come v/ithin close quarters of their adversaries, the ultimate objective of any attack being little more than to get within close enough range for indifferent fire to be effective. The Problem of bringing the Bands to a ction This was of course the crux of the whole matter, and it bristled with difficulties. -ot only was it necessary to force an enemy to fight whose one ambition was to run away, but he had to be brought to action early enough in the day for the attack to be pressed home before darkness gave him his chance to escape. There were three chief methods by which this might be achieved. The first method was to draw him from his lair by means of a tempting bait onto ground where troops and aircraft could make use of their mobility to concentrate superior force before he could retreat. The bait was generally a road convoy of civilian vehicles with a small escort, or sometimes a telephone repair gang. In the background were the air and land striking forces standing by at suitable centres ready to rush out in answer to an XX or GG call in the manner previously described. The second method consisted of little more than ’’trailing the coat” in the hopes that someone would tread on it and start a fight. Under this heading came 'searches” and 'drives” of the type of Operation X, which were also of use for showing the flag. The best procedure was probably to send columns to occupy villages and secure water supplies with a view to denying them to the bands while at the same time offering some sort of backing to villages which had suffered from terrorism and which might be inclined to produce information if pro tected from reprisals. It must be admitted however that 'coat-trail ing” methods seldom induced the bands to fight at all and in any case gave them a free choice as to the time and place for any action. Lastly there was the deliberate operation, based upon good informa tion, which was usually undertaken with the ooject of surrounding a band and destroying it completely. It was of course* only possible to attempt this when really good information could be obtained, and this was all too rare and in fact almost unknown until the last stages of the rebellion. If the information was good the action ^/as usually decisive, and it may fairly be said that once the enem^ had been brought to battle early in the day no difficulty was ever experienced in inflicting upon him a severe defeat. The conduct of offensive action against the ra nds Success usually depended upon completing a successful envelopment of the enemy, and to accomplish this it was essential^ that once contact had been gained it should never be lost. Once lost it was usually los for good, and to keep contact it was necessary to keep go in S after dar with a view to continuing the action in the morning. ^nis was selaom achieved in 1936, owing to the fact that most ot the ^ 0C &gt;P S ^re reinforcements unfamiliar with the lie of tie ana an were ^ equipped with pack transport, which would have made them Ics. depend ent upon their motor transport which too °f t ? n , the neighbourhood of the main roads and prevented eremv to his lair. In the attack it paid to go m with the oayonet enemy to nis ±a , 200 yar a s; by the time tms stage once the range had closoa to aooux * 2 «« A ir u. hpr rf .cn 3 t- had hppn reached few Arabs were ever inclined .o off or further res s ■ had been reacnea nri -, v too ready to surrender rather than risk a ance and were usually only '-oo fight at close quarters.44816-1 132 To take full advantage of every chance encounter it was necessary that striking forces should be maintained in a high state of readiness prepared to act on a minimum of orders the moment the G-G- call was received. After that a good knowledge of the ground, physical fitness and light equipment, and good intercommunication - especially in respect of visual and the Middle East Ground Code - were the most important elements. In deliberate operations results were mostly achieved by small mobile columns which moved on a wide front to find the enemy and were capable of concentrating quickly to pin and attack him. For this purpose converging columns stood a better chance than parallel columns ”driving' against a line of stops. Columns had to be prepared to stay out for 48 hours without being supplied, and the smaller and more- numerous they were tne better. Provided a column had the means of sending out an XX call there was little chance of its ever being overwhelmed, and even a platoon could be employed independently under such conditions. The most useful type of column, however, usually comprised a Comp,any Headquarters and two platoons with one machine-gun and a mortar. Types of actions with Armed Bands Descriptions have already been given in a previous chapter of the type of action resulting from an enemy attack on a 'bait” followed by the arrival of air and land striking forces. To close this chapter two further typical actions will be described. The first is a chance encounter occurring at an early period, while the other illustrates one of the later^engagements resulting from deliberate operations based on good information in which considerable forces were employed. The action near Kafr al Laba d. (See Map Ho. 3) At 0300 hrs. on the 28th July a detachment of the Lincolns were on their way to occupy daylight picquet on the road between Tulkarm and Nablus when heavy fire was opened from both sides of the road, wounding one soldier. ^ XX and GG calls were sent out, and the detachment deployed and engaged the enemy, killing tv/o and wounding one. The XX call was picked up by an aircraft on its way back to Ramleh. at once went to the scene of the action and located a party of seven armed men to the South-West of Kafr al Labad. Air action was taken an o e reoels killed. Meanwhile two Harts from Ramleh had gone to the assistance of the Lincolns, and inflicted a bomb and machine-gun attack on a band of some twenty to thirty men: twelve bombs were dropped and a number of casualties were observed. While the ^ ciG ^ on i n progress a land striking force with tanks, armoured c^rs and a naval pom-pom arrived on the scene and went into action, the ^ cnc i rc ling movement about Bala with a view to cutting off the retreat of the rebels. Near this village a party were intercepted and two killed, while the armoured cars killed one more. By now the bands were dispersing in haste m all directions, pursued hotly by the aircraft which inflicted further casualoies. _ The biggest group, of about twenty, was chased in ° in £ 321 grove west of Kafr al Labad to which troops G irec e 1 txe aircraft. A search of the area however showed G ,'‘ 10 i 1 *' 3 iac ^ already flown, and only one dead body remained. By 1700 hrs. all was over, the enemy’s casualties then being reckoned at not less than 21 killed and wounded. ine Kafr al Labad action was one typical of the period: it iliustrates a case^in which the bands were brought to action early in t. e day m the vicinity of a main road - an ideal state of affairs.44816-1 163 It snows the ease with which a thorough defeat could be inflicted imder sucn conditions, but it shows also the difficulty of completing that dex eat by preventing the escape of survivors of the first attacks. The Action near Beit Umri n. (See Map No. 3) On the night of the 28th September information reached the Head- quarters of tne^l6th Infantry Brigade at Nablus that a large band under Fauzi ^uwaqji himself was at Yasid, a village in difficult hill country some j.ive miles Yorth of Nablus. Air reconnaissance of the area was ordered for the following morning and three striking forces were to stand 05 from dawn ready to answer GG calls under the instructions of the brigade commander. These consisted of:- 2 Dorset Strik ing Force (Jenin) Two platoons, one machine-gun section, one Mortar detachment. t N.S. Fus. Strikin g Force (Nablus) :- About one Company. 2 Bedfs. Herts. Striking Fo rce (Nablus) About 200 men. In addition the 2.Lincoln Striking Force, consisting of one Company with a naval pom-pom and two armoured cars of the 11th Hussars, remained in reserve at Tulkarm. Four tanks at Tubas and three at Tulkarm were also to be ready to move, as well as the section of the Chestnut Troop R.il.A. and the 45th (How) Field Battery at Nablus. The intention of the Brigade Commander was to use his three striking forces to converge from a North, South-East and North-Test direction on any enemy which might be located by the aircraft* No news of the enemy was received the following day until about 1000 hrs. when aircraft located mounted men to the West of Yasid, between that village and Beit Umrin, which lay some four miles distant. A GG call was sent and at 1020 hrs. Brigade Headquarters issued orders to put the converging plan into operation. The three striking forces were ordered to move onto Yasid which was to be occupied by 1215 hrs; and all aircraft movement over the area was to cease until that hour. The tanks were to fill the gaps between the converging infantry columns to the East and ’.Test of Yasid in order to form a cordon to hold rebels who might try to break back between the columns. One section of 4“5” howitzers of the 45th Battery was ordered to the vicinity of Silat adh Dhahr, and that of the R.K.A. 3‘7 M howitzers was to follow up the R.S. Fus. Striking Force in their advance on Yasid from the South-East. The remaining section of field howitzers was to occupy a position close to Nablus with an O.P. on the Jabal nbal from which enemy could be engaged if they tried to break away to the South. The three Striking Forces moved out at about 1100 nrs.; the Dorsets taking the approach from the North and moving by M.T. over rough tracks towards Siris village, which lay within tnroe miles 01 -ns oDjecoive, while the R.S. Fus. followed a good track leading into woods four miles South-East of Yasid. The Bedfords' debussing point was Jaba, four miles North—Y/est of Yasid. Both Dorsets and R.S. Fus., c^fter a good many difficulties in getting transport forward, reached giound quite impaosable to M.T. and were forced to continue on foot tor the last two or thrte miles of the approach. This involved a long and arduous carry for the machine-gunners over very difficult country, and in sonic cases Arabs and pack animals were commandeered en route to assist. The R.o. Fus. reached the ridge South of Yasid at 1500 hrs. and occupied a position overlooking the village preparatory to further reconnaissance, but at 15._o hours44816-1 164 were ordered to withdraw in view of the fact that the enemy had by the been located much further V/est, and Brigade Headquarters wished to h ^ the R.S. Pus. Striking Force back in reserve before dark. By r72(fhr- the R.S. Pus. returned to their transport without encountering any 0 d ition, and at 1845 hrs. were back in Nablus after being sniped from th° S slopes of Mount Ebal on their way home. The Dorsets to the North of 6 them had managed eventually to get their transport to within some two thousand yards of Yasid by 144-5 hrs. and at 1630 hrs. occupied the village. Again no opposition was encountered, though one armed Arab had been caught trying to get back into the village and had been taken prisoner. The Dorsets remained in Yasid for the night. Meanwhile a battle had developed' to the 7, r est. The Bedfords debussed at Jaba at 1145 hrs. and started to advance towards Yasid* but as they crossed the ridge South-East of Jaba heavy fire was opened'on the leading troops from the front. The advance continued under the cover of rifle, machine-gun and mortar fire, and by 1300 hrs. the enemy position had been occupied. The enemy, estimated at a strength of fifty including some mounted men, drew off to the South and entered the wo ods to the East of Beit Umrin. In their retreat they lost six killed and three prisoners, while there is no doubt that further casualties went undetected in the trees. By this time aircraft were in action all over the area and reported a general movement of rebels from several directions into the Beit Umrin woods, a number of mounted men being prominent. Soon the trees had swallowed up most of the bands andor a brief interval contact was dost. Air action and artillery fire was hov/ever directed continually upon those woods where the enemy was known to be, and later investigation shov/ed that heavy casualties were inflicted. Soon after 1500 hrs. aircraft over Beit Umrin sent out a GG call for rein! or cements which was answered by the Lincoln Striking Force in reserve at Tulkarm; while by this time the Bedfords were closing in on the village. The Lincolns debussed at 1620 hrs. on the main road two miles to the West, and at 1715 hrs. reached Beit Umrin whence heavy firing could oe heard to the North, East and South. The advance con tinued towards the woods from which direction the Lincolns now came under eavy ire in die failing light. By this time the enemy in the neigh bourhood had been estimated at two to three hundred. Unfortunately it had become clear by this time that neither Bed- fords nor Lincolns could hope to close with the enemy before being over- taken by darkness, and the Brigade Commander therefore ordered both Striking Forces to fall back on their transport. The Bedfords were ac^' m Nablus by 1925 hrs., being heavily sniped on the way from the region o the main road. The Lincolns’ retirement was however hard- pressed and all available fire, including that of the naval pom-pom aii ne mortar, nad to be brought to bear to check some two hundred of the enemy who were making strenuous efforts to take advantage of the rapidly increasing darkness to close in on the rearmost troops. It was not unnl after 2000 hrs. that the Lincolns got within reach of their ranspor , laving^ had one man wounded and another with a leg broken as a reoU 0; ^ xa H into a ravine. The evacuation of these casualties caused considerable delay to the withdrawal, but timely aid was rendered by a single platoon of the Dorsets v/hich had now appeared on Sabastya hill to the South flank of the withdrawal. This single platoon had had an adventurous evening. Owing to a partial error it had been despatched from Jenin at 1600 hrs., and had road 73 ^+ j 0 / 16 - 01 the R * S * ?

Pus. remained it dawn the next morning aircraft thoroughly reconnoitred the whole area and dropped supplies for the eighty odd Dorsets in laid- but no enemy were sighted and it was clear that the survivors ^ bands had made good their escape. At 0900 hrs. Brigade Headquarters therefore ordered both detachments of Dorsets to re4n to J Jin. The total enemy casualties proved later to have amounted to at least forty-two dead and fifteen wounded, though it is almost certain that the actual figures were much higher. The Government forces had had three wounded, while during the course of the action over five thousand rounds of ^.A.A. alone had been expended. t-he engagement illustrated well the difficulties of carrying out a planned operation over this sort of ground when adequate reconnaissance beforehand nad not been possible - as the long delay in reaching Yasid even without opposition bears witness - and in consequence the complete dependence upon the course of action taken by subordinate commanders on the spot. The action of the Dorset platoon and that of the R.S. Pus. picquet commander are good examples of this. It illustrates also the elusiveness of the enemy, his skilful use of cover to avoid air action, and his faculty for escaping from almost any predicament under cover of darkness if troops are unable to keep close contact during the night' so as to renew the offensive in the morning. In this case it was mainly a lack of pack transport which prevented the Striking Forces going on into the hills after night had fallen. A final lesson of the engagement was the success which invariably attended any attempt at an enveloping movement, of which the move round Sabastya provided a good example.44816-1 166 CHAPTER 16 / \ CONCLUSION - SUMviARY OF THE MIN LESSON S This final chapter represents an attempt to sum up as briefly as ■ possible the principal lessons for the future which have emerged in the preceding pages. STRATEGY IN REBELLION The Courses open to the Autho rities A civil government or a General Officer Commanding faced with the task of suppressing rebellion will usually have the choice of two alterna tives. Either they must adopt repressive measures to crush revolt, or they may continue a policy of moderation and attempt to maintain so far as is possible the normal life of the country until reason prevails once more and rebellion dies a natural death. Experience in Palestine goes to show that there is no reason to believe that the latter course will ever succeed unless the authorities are prepared to make some concession to force rather than use the instruments of force at their own disposal. If reason was still likely to prevail a state of armed rebellion would probably never have started, and its very existence proves that the other side have abandoned reason as an instrument of policy. Thus an attempt to maintain the normal life of the country under such conditions only helps to provide the rebel elements with the means of continuing the struggle, dissipates the strength of the armed forces on unproductive duties, and inevitably prolongs the period of resistance. Sooner or later it must lead to the adoption of repressive measures in some degree, and the longer they are delayed the more severe will they need to become. Rebellion in fact will seldom be ended by conciliation, and in the long run the adoption of repressive measures from the very start will probably be both the most expedient and the most humane way of restoring peace. The Action necessary to crush rebell ion Any plan designed to end rebellion must make adequate provision for three things (a) The defence of the life and property of that section of the population which remains in support of law and order. (b) The protection of vital communications. (c) The defeat of the rebel armed forces. In order to achieve this treble object the authorities will have at their disposal the Police (including any irregular police which may be enrolled to meet the emergency, and the Fighting Forces. V/hich of them are employed on which tasks must depend upon the scale of attack anticipated, and each must be confined to the tasks for which they are most suited. 'There can be no excuse for using troops on duties for which the police are better fitted: any attempt to do so will lead both to a loss of efficiency and a lack of economy of force, and gaps in the police ranks should be filled by raising more irregular police and not by diverting troops from military tasks. Of the three oasks mentioned above, the first should remain primarily the responsi* - bility of the police, the second will usually require the joint efforts of police and troops, while the last should be left to the troops alone.44816-1 167 / % ihe Choice of an Object in the employment of the Fighting Pbrc es The defeat of the enemy's armed forces is the main object of the three services in war, and should be the same in rebellion, which is only a lesser degree of war. Every possible effort should therefore be made to free fighting men from defensive duties to take the field against armed rebels, and this will usually be accomplished by the employment of the police in the defensive role. Certain communications and vulnerable points will of course always De essential for military purposes and for this reason some troops will have to be diverted to their protection, but every soldier or airman employed upon such duties will be one less to oppose the armed rebels in the field and it is on the existence of the armed elements that the fate of the rebellion will depend. The V/eapon of Martial Law Military operations in Palestine suffered under three main handicaps: a lack of information, coupled with much loss of secrecyj restrictions on the use of force, which deprived the services of making proper use of the weapons with which they were equipped and the methods of war to which they had been trained; and the fact that the enployment of the forces was dictated by the needs of the civil government and was not necessarily devoted to the attainment of the best military objects. Pbr all three disabilities Martial Law would at least have supplied a partial cure, and there can be little doubt that once the armed forces have become the principal weapon with which to defeat rebellion and are no longer serving merely as second string to the police, their task will be much facilitated by a declaration of Martial Law. It is however all inportant that the full effect of Martial Law should be felt from the very start, and this will necessitate careful preparations beforehand. TACTICS IN REBELLION Command of the Fo rces Operations under conditions of rebellion are mostly composed of the actions of small units, and a wide degree of decentralisation of command becomes necessary. This is best achieved by dividing the country into military areas, allotting troops to each area, and leaving the commanders as free a hand as possible within their own boundaries. In drawing these boundaries the aim should be to keep them identical with those of the civil administrative districts and sub-districts; and subsequent re-arrangements of areas will be easier if division is made into two, four, or eight parts. The troops in each area should be strong enough to provide their own local reserves, and if a central general reserve^ is required it may be best ensured by earmarking certain units or formations already allotted to areas. This will be more economical than holding units back in H.Q. reserve to meet a contingency which may never anise. An exception may be made in the case of locally-raised forces, which are better employed without any area responsibilities in an independent role direct under Force Headquarters. The employment of the various Arm s Though all arms were employed in Palestine it was inevitably upon the infantry and the aircraft that the heaviest demands were made. The former were necessary for all work in the town areas, for e ensive^ duties, and for co-operation with the aircraft in offensive ac ion i-- e hills; while the aircraft was often the main striking power in the hands of the commander and was always the only arm which had superior mobility over the enemy in all conditions. There were few actions m Palestine44816-1 168 xn which the closest co-operation of infantry and aircraft was not rea^ired to secure the best results: the success of that co-operation ln was largely due to the organization of the system of XX calls an the working of that system in the field was perhaps the most striking feature of the whole of the operations. Of the other anus the armoured cars were perhaps the most important- even with the whole of the 11th Hussars and a company and a half of Boval Air Force cars there were never enough to meet all demands, and improvi sation had sometimes to be resorted to or tanks used in their place. The results achieved by the single tank company amply justified its*employ ment in Palestine, though perhaps tanks come near to being in the luxury c ass in rebellion if sufficient armoured cars are available. Motorised cavalry were particularly valuable as a mobile reserve or for employment in esert areas, but the absence of a horsed regiment for work in the mils was much felt throughout. There was little scope for the employ- ment of artUlery, except for weapons like the naval pom-pom which could e firea from a road vehicle: otherwise the infantry mortar filled the normal role of the gun. There was ample demand for engineers to justify ^e normal proportion of field companies: railway units were also needed ami very good use was made of an anti-aircraft searchlight company in the protection of communications. The Protection of Communication s experience showed that the requirements of a system of protection are much the^same in all types of communications. It is necessary to give protection only to those which are really vital to the military needs, which will generally correspond with the most necessary of the civil needs. Where sufficient troops are available protection will be be ^ er forded by holding the ground from which attacks can be delivered rather than by guarding the communication system itself. This will lead to the establishment of a chain of posts v/hich vail be expensive in troops: economy can be effected by substituting patrols in their place, but these can seldom do more than act as a deterrent and as a meano of detecting sabotage. It will generally be impossible to protect tne whole length of communications, and protective efforts will best be concentrated upon those points where sabotage will cause the greatest . ama S e * PinchLly in rebellion more than any other form of war perhaps it is true oo say that offence will provide the best defence. Offensive Action in the defeat of armed rebels the greatest difficulty will usually b ? t ° 1 br J ng them to action at all. The methods of doing this will U ° U 4 - / ©pend upon the information that can be gained, but arrangements must be made to hit the enemy hard whenever he appears. This will require b e organization of air and land striking forces which can concen rate rapidly at any point where the enemy has shown himself, and p ro ^ c ' s ° bbe c^c^-tion of a M bait H to make him show himself; Once ontact has been gained it is essential that it should not be lost until the full force of the blow has been struck: the rebels will 1 ^ u, bo avoa( ^ ^his by making use of darkness to retreat, and ^roops mus be able to keep out at night in order to maintain contact so to r ® new the battle in the morning. Offensive action at might - xce ^ or approach marches to obtain surprise - will usually place the enemy a an advantage. In the attack envelopment will always achieve e ^results, since the chief difficulty will be to prevent the n my using his superior mobility to escape. Jbr the rest, the main requiremen o of offensive action will be good information, a continual s raving a ter surprise, good training in night movement, independence oi a line of communications, and certain legislation which will facili- a e mi 1 °P e rations. In addition a B.A.F. organization which can ensure supplies by air being delivered at short notice will be a most valuable adjunct.44816-1 169 AInD ADbIL'IISTItATI^ of the ARyff Admini stration The chief administrative lessons were the need for constant imorovi- sation especially in the early stages when units of some teohnicafS^s were not represented m the force; and the difficulties of conducting operations on active service under conditions of peace-time accounting. Transport . give tr °0Ps an ali-round superiority in mobility over their lightly-equipped native opponents an anple supoly of light fast motor vehicles and of pack animals was required. 'loth were obtained Tr s^fficienu. numbers from civil sources. The pack animals had to be suit able tor carriage in M.T. vehicles, and for this purpose donkeys were far the best. Weapons and Equipment So far as experiences of weapons and equipment went the most notice able lessons were provided by the success of the infantry mortar in this ^ype oi ..ariare, the need of a light mobile searchlight and of an improved _ set with more range than the No. 1 set and more mobility (for pack transport) than the ,, C H set. Intercommunicatio n The main lesson was the necessity for wide reliance upon W/T. Distances were usually too great to permit of military lines being laid, while the civil lines were continually cut by saboteurs and were a constant source of leakage of information. Despatch riders were far too vulnerable to ambush; and in fact W/T became of necessity the only safe and really effective means of communication. The scale of W/T provided for signal units in Palestine was insufficient for the purpose. 'Notes on Imperial Policing, 19 54” Frequent reference to this War Office publication has teen mace in these pages. Its application to the situation in Palestine was nearly uncanny; it might almost have been written specially for those condi tions, and throughout the rebellion it served as a close and constant guide to the forces engaged in its suppression. CONCLUSION The rebellion in Palestine provides perhaps mere than any thing else an example of the consequences of delaying the application of force meet force. The failure of a policy of conciliation lea in -he end to the despatch of a Field Force from England and the adopt ion ^of mere severe regression than might perhaps have been needed rad it teen apt—ed from the beginning. The years which followed the rebellion show the results of a failure to carry repression to its logical conclusion cy leaving the armed forces of the enemy intact in the fie_a. In rebellion as in war, peace can seldom be res tore c. in full -=0 long as the la—e.^ remain undefeated; to defeat them, therefore, should be the first ana foremost object of the Fighting Forces.

Wide ^Persian of the troops and the low proportion of boai. casualties a mobile medical unit was never found necessary an a 3U_ f t :i f n ° y , of raotor ambulances was all that vjas required,' One car was attached to each unit and in addition pools of ambulanc^ were maintained at Jerusalem and Haifa, Casualties m action were evacuated direct to the R.A.F. General hospital or to the nearest Government or Voluntary Hospital after receiving first aid. No difficulties arose in this respect. The employment ol vast numbers of small detachments made it impossible to furnish medical personnel with each, and the difficulty was met by the provision of first aid outfits and the instruction in first aid by unit medical officers of as many men as possible. This situation brought out very clearly the necessity for a wider knowledge of first aid among officers and men of all units in operations of this kind. The arrival of the 4th Field Ambulance enabled the reception station at Haifa to be expanded to a Military Hospital of 300 beds while that at Jerusalem had meanwhile been enlarged to a total of 60. The Base Hospital of the Force was the 3rd General Hospital at Alexandria and the method of evacuation was by rail ambulance coaches or by the Royal Naval Hospital Ship ' Maine 1 1 , which had been placed at the disposal of the G.O.C. by the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean. Use was also made of returning troopships. It had at first been considered v/hether the Hospital Ship ' Main e' should be used as a Base Hospital at Haifa, but it was eventually decided to employ her as a carrier to save patients a long and trying (and sometimes dangerous) railway journey. There were also practical drawbacks in using the ship as a base hospital in that she could only take about 100 patients in cots, the remainder being in three-tier berths which were unsuitable for nursing when the ship was in port. The arrival of the medical units of the Palestine Emergency Force enabled the following organizations to be established:- Mi lit any Hospital, Jerusalem (4th Fd Amb) - ^00 beds. Military Hospital, Haifa (3 C.G. S. ) 240 beds. Main Dressing Station, Nazareth (2/3rdCav. Fd. Amb.) (Light cases). These, with the R.A.F. General Hospital at Sarafand, provided a total hospital accommodation of 670 beds which proved ample foi the Force, which by then numbered some 22,000 and filled approximately two-thirds of the available beds. The 2/3rd Cavalry Field Ambulance, while manning the Main Dressing Station at Nazareth, was also available in reserve as a mobile unit for use in Trans-Jordan or elsewhere if the necessity arose. The final medical lay-out in October is shown in Map No. 1. Separate arrangements were made for local trea men y civilian44816-1 182 specialists for ophthalmic and ears-nose-and-throat cases. A consulting surgeon and a consulting physician were available from Egypt. There were four Dental Officers with the Force, including one R.A.E. Officer. The great bulk of the casualties were due to sickness - battle casualties amounted only to 155 in all - but in general the health of the Force was very satisfactory. Sandfly fever accounted for the high est number of hospital admissions (over 200 a month at times). Though Bamber Oil and nets were issued to all troops, the oil was not applied frequently enough as a rule and supervision of protective measures was difficult owing to the wide dispersion of the troops. It was not generally realised that Bamber Oil loses its effect in about an hour, and an unlimited issue to units was found to be essential. It also be came necessary in places to protect sentries with head-nets and gauntlets, but these were not available at first and there was often a disinclination to use them. Diseases of the digestive system came next in order, followed by 'I.A.T.' cases (inflammation of the Areolar Tissue) which had accounted for 257 b of the sick v;astage of the Great War. Strenuous efforts to combat the latter met v/ith a good measure of success. Fresh fruit was included in the ration, and special insistence made upon personal clean liness and early attention to small cuts and abrasions which so often turn septic and develop into more serious complaints. In dealing with the latter Elastoplast proved a great boon as its ready and easy applica tion ensured its early use. Cases of Malaria were remarkably few although the disease is endemic in Palestine. In part at least this vra.s due to the beneficial results achieved by the. civil malaria service, but energetic measures to secure personal prophylaxis contributed largely. In particularly malarious regions (such as the Jordan valley) troops were given prophylactic quinine - 5 grains daily with 10 grains on Fridays, starting wherever possible three days before moving to the infected area. Cases of dysen tery were few, due perhaps to widespread propaganda regarding fly-proof ing, and mostly slight ovung to early admission to hospital and treatment by serum and salines. There were no cases of typhoid, although it was endemic among the native population, and the value of the T.A.B. inocu lation was very evident. A low incidence of venereal disease may be attributed largely to the fact that troops were kept very fully enployed and an early curfew for the civil population in the main tov/ns was in force throughout. During October, v/hen the strength of the garrison reached its peak, hospital in-patients numbered 40 officers and 1233 other ranks, while out-patient treatment was given during the same period to 10 officers and 2293 other ranks. Medical lessons so far as they affect the troops themselves provide no novelty. The need for a wider knowledge of first aid, the importance of personal prophylaxis to combat malaria and sandfly, the need of personal cleanliness and the early treatment of minor wounds as a precaution against I.A.T., the menace of flies and the danger in regard to dysentery of buying fruit and drinks frcm natives, and finally the influence of the junior officer and N.C.O. in keeping dov/n venereal disease were the principal lessons. In addition a very real need was felt for some form of portable hot-water bathing system designed on a Company basis; while the lectures and demonstrations required to be given by King’s Regulations, paragraph 800 (b), did not seem sufficient to secure effective instruc tion in sanitation.APPENDIX VII 44816-1 183 MOTOR TPiAI'jSPOP.T RUttT.TO SCALE NO. 1 T/pioal 'Company Lift' for a Striking Force.

The eight cells are bound firmly together with three or four turns of adhesive tape and carried in the larger of the two partitions of an anti-gas respirator haversack. The key-board is removed from the lamp box and connected to the batteries with a 3-foot lead. The box containing spare bulbs etc., the lighting attachment and the key-board is placed in the smaller partition of the haversack. To operate the lamp on the move all that is necessary is to remove the key-board from the haversack and connect with the lead from the lamp, which is carried by No. 2. The method could be improved upon by substituting a leather case, similar to the heliograph case, for the respirator haversack. 192 44816-1APPENDIX XV 44816-1 193 (HOTS:- This report is included solely as an illustration of a tanK sic-cion and for this purpose the place-names bear lit ule significance.

We left TULKARM at 0930 hours on 8/10/36 and reached the entrance to the wadi at 1005 hours without mishap. We proceeded up the Wadi to a point where T.1058 stuck and had to be towed out. The party then continued for another 400 yards when the same tank ripped a track off. This was replaced. (it was now about 1045 hours). Half a mile more was completed when T.1163 shed a track. This took nearly an hour to replace. The party moved on at approximately 1200 hours, and arrived at 1245 hours at a point close to KAFR SUR. T.1163 had a second track off here, and T.1058 also ripped off a track in turning round to go to the assistance of T.1163. My intention had been to proceed up the wadi over the saddle between ER RAS and KAFR SUR, thence S.E. to return by the wadi HAWWATAT, but after these last two breakages, I decided to return by the same wadi. At approximately 1400 hours, when the track was practically finished one rifle shot rang out, and was followed by sniping from the hills on three sides. Under cover of machine gun fire, the drivers completed the job, and the party turned and proceeded 'westward. We had only completed aoout 500 yards when T.1060, which was bringing up the rear, shed a track in the wadi bed. The other two tanks were recalled by Verey light, after a little difficulty, and the track was repaired. Sniping was still continuing, and the drivers did good work in repairing the breakdown. During this period I noticed 10 to 15 Armed Arabs^ running over the hills to the N.V., with the obvious intention of ambushing us further west. It was about 1520 hours when the section moved on again. Re had only gone another 200 yards when T.1163 shed a track, badly, with four smashed track plates* I concentrated the tanks, one on either side of tne broken-down tank, and the drivers commenced to repair the tank under cover of our M.G. fire. It was very difficult to locate tne enemy, especially on the SOUTH side, where an olive grove came up to within 15 to X 20 yards of the tanks: therefore, our fire was not very effective. At 1535 hours I reported the situation to Company H.Q., at 'TULKARM, as follows:- 'To - CATO t x From - CATO 6 (Lieut. M. Hutton;44816-1 194 Am half mile west of KAPR SUE. Have encountered an armed band about 20 strong. One tank got track off. Ifajr need assistance withdrawing. Jmi “'being sniped on now. ,r Between 1535 hours and 1650 hours I sent messages as under:- 'From CATO - Lieut. Mills is coming out now. To CATO - No. He need not start yet. I may be able to withdraw without help. From CATO - Any chance of cutting them off? To CATO - No chance of getting behind band, return only Tank has tracks off. Question &lt; From CATO - How about attacking from the air? To CATO - Yes. Air v/ould probably get good shooting. From CATO - 0. K. To CATO - Keep open - off.' in During this time the drivers had succeeded in getting the track of T.1163 under the 'bogie wheels in spite of continuous and fairly accurate oniping. a &lt;_ about 1630 hours, as the fire v/as becoming increasingly heavy and accurate, I ordered the drivers to get into their tanks and close down completely. The drivers were fearless in their efforts to repair the tank and deserve great credit. Although the firing was heavy we could not see many of the enemy, as they were still about 600 to 800 yards away on most sides, and the sun was beginning to set. At 1700 hours, the enemy started to attack from all sides and then I realised that my original estimate of their strength as ^ was incorrect, as X saw about four parties of about 15 to 20 strong, moving along the crests of the hills on all sides. I then sent ohe S.0.6. signal out, I had no time for further wirelessing, there must nave been at least 50 of them. They started running in towards us from the surrounding hills, shouting and screaming. They Uoed the cover of the rocks well. They advanced in very open order so that there v/as seldom a target of more than one man, although Cpl. Lev/is get one goou burst amongst a party of 8 at about 600 yards. During their approach we managed to hit a few in the failing light. At 1720 hours the situation was critical. My gun had jammed - Cpl. Lewis's gun would fire only single shots - Cpl. Prosser's gun alone v/as firing properly. The enemy v/ere about 300 yards av/ay and closing in quickly. Their benaviour v/as fanatical and only a direct hit could stop them. At this moment an aeroplane appeared. I fired several Verey Lights and the pilot spotted us. He dropped a message on us and fortunately made an excellent shot, which landed only 5 yards av/ay. ihe message said, 'Am reporting your ix^ALtion'. i n ^ opinion this aeroplane made a tremendous difference to the situation, for two reasons. First, it caused the Arabs to hesitate in their advance for a few minuoes, and mis enabled me to get iry gun working again: secondly, it must have shown tne band leader that I v/as in touch with our troops and mat reinforcements would arrive at some time. The aeroplane was unable to stay vi An us as it v/as close on dusk. When it had disappeared, the Arabs continued their advance and closed right on to the tanks, I ordered opl. Lewis and Cpl. Prosser to close down, v/hich they did. Unfortunately a bullet struck my lid on the spring catch and jammed it open, so I was unable to close dov/n. It was dark now and the enemy v/ere within 20 yards of us. They v/ere firing from the v/adi, from behind the trees in the olive grove, and from behind the numerous boulders. There were also44816-1 195 qui-ce a number firing 4 -u , could not see the eneny ver^ ^u'^ltho/h^ Beln S ^ an occasional shadow.

Nothing was found but empty cases? ‘ They had removed all their wounded etc., except for the one Arab which was by Qpl* Prosser's tank. Cpl. Prosser had backed his tank on top of the dead Min to prevent them getting him away. We took a rifle off this man and two bandoliers containing 46 rounds of assorted ammunition. There were no casualties amongst our party. We moved off about 0900 hours and joined the Section of Tanks which had come out to look for us the night before. Both sections then returned to TULKARM without further incident. I should like to mention that Cpl. Prosser and Cpl. Lewis both behaved extremely well and kept their heads in a difficult situation and that the three drivers, L/Cpl. Fry, Pte. Thompson and Pte.

(Note: Attached as Map No.2). NOTE: This Order supersedes Operation Instruction No. 6A, which should now be destroyed. INFORMATION 1. The outstanding military problem at the moment in Palestine is the vigorous action of reoel armed bands. Armed bands vary in size from 5 - 70 rifles. ^ They are well led. Tactics are improved and show signs of military training. Armed bands are mobile; live on the country and move rapidly from one area to another. 2. Attacks are usually directed against escorts, convoys, patrols, picquets, billets, camps, aircraft, communications, the civil organiza tion of the country and Jewish Settlements and interests. Attacks by fire action and ambush on motor vehicles have been frequent and instances have occurred where picquets taking up position have been fired on. Fire directed against aircraft is effective and aircraft have been hit on many occasions. 3. At first their operations were confined mostly to the hill country ol the NAELUS-TULKARii—JENIN area but are now becoming more widespread: particularly in the hills of Galilee close to SAFAD and TIHERIAS. 4. In che hill country of Palestine where movement off roads by ground forces is restricted, the destruction of armed bands is best achieved by the action oi tne air striking force working in close co-operation with a ground striking force in support of ground forces, aircraft or the organisation on which attacks develop. The policy of bringing them to action and pressing home the attack once contact is gained is being pursued with the utmost vigour. INTENTION - L ° ri early support by air action, and, if necessary, troops, to aimed j.orcco or the civil organisation engaged in action against armed bands. METHOD OF EXECUTION . (ABRfflGED) . p* ■ i0 implement this intention the organisation given in detail below, is as follows. The air striking force comprises two Hart Squadrons, ^ (Bomber) Squadron and No. 33 (Bomber) Squadron based at RAMLEH (Detached flight No. 6 (b) Squadron — SAvIAKH) and GAZA, respectively,44816-1 199 capable of ^forcing U ^°other^^Sl'^ ^ MEJAMI - Each is part in an air action^n Palestine. llnS ’ lf neoessar y» al l to take is primarily the ocmitmenT^f^ne alrC ^ aft zones - Each aircraft zone noted above, may be reinforced by the^strSing^^f 33 striking force which^av^e^er 0al ' L for . air su PPont to the air column operating in Palestine bv w/T^r d etachment, convoy or the nearest W/T station fnr n a + ° ^ ’ tele P^ lone or other means^ to Which carry a Lbile rack Lf^^“sion.

METHOD OP EXECUTION. (ELABORATED^ Aircraft Zone System 13. Palestine is divided into four aircraft zones (a) The Northern Aircraft Zone. (b) The Middle Aircraft Zone. (c) The Southern Aircraft Zone. (d) The Jordan Aircraft Zone. 14. The divisions between zones are shown on Map 1 attached and are:- ( a ) Northern and Middle Aircraft Zones A line west and east through JENIN (inclusive to the Middle Air craft Zone). (h) Middle and Southern Aircraft Zones A line from the coast to the Dead Sea through AL MAJDAL, AL PALUJA, inclusive; HEBRON, exclusive to the Southern Aircraft Zone. (c) Jordan Aircraft Zone That portion of the Jordan Area v/hich lies between the Northern Aircraft Zone and the Jerusalem administrative boundary.44816-1 200 The Air Striking Force 15. The air striking allotted as follows:- force in Palestine is based, and aircraft zones No. 6 (B) Sqdn. (5 flights). RAMLEH. Middle A/C Zone. No. 6 (B) Sqdn. d flight). SAMAKH. Northern A/C Zone. No. 33 (B) Sqdn. (3 flights). GAZA. Southern A/C Zone. No. 14 (B) Sqdn. d flight). JISR AL MEJAMI. Jordan A/C Zone. O PERATIONS 16. 'XX' W/T lorries (hired trucks fitted with W/T sets in charge of R.A. F. 7/ire less Operators) are allocated to Divisions and at their direction are employed with convoys, escorts and columns on operations in areas where contact with armed bands is most likely to be made. 17. It should be noted that the role of the 'XX' W/T lorry is to send ou o XX' and 'GO-' calls. It should not be used for any other purposes whatever. For example, it is not possible for the 'XX' W/T lorry to communicate with aircraft flying overhead, since it is tuned in to the wave length of the air base appropriate to the aircraft zone in which it is operating. 18. When a detachment or convoy with which an 'XX' W/T lorry is in company is fired upon, an 'XX' call will at once be sent out as explained in paragraph 31. 19. If the Detachment or Column Commander decides that the support of troops is also necessary he will instruct the W/T operator to send out the 'GG-' call in addition. 20. If detachments are attacked and no 'XX' lorry is in company, local signal arrangements should be such as to enable an 'XX' call to be relayed by alternative means to the nearest W/T station whence it can be sent to the appropriate air base, as described in paragraph 35. 21. An alternative means of gaining contact with armed bands is by low flying reconnaissance aircraft which so far have formed an irresistible target for rebel bands. Low flying reconnaissance aircraft should, therefore, be sent out by Commanders or O.C. R.A.F. Station, RAIvDEH, to locate armed bands if reliable infomation indicates their presence. If fire is opened on aircraft an 'XX' call should at once be sent by the crew. 22. Army co-operation aircraft encountering fire from the ground will act accordingly in every way. This is especially necessary when the army co-operation crew observe troops about to engage armed bands or held up by ambush or resistance. 23. The O.C. R.A.F. Station, RAMLEH, is responsible that one aircraft at each air base, RAMLEH, GAZA and SAMAKH, is maintained in a constant state of readiness and is despatched immediately in answer to 'XX' calls for action in the aircraft zone appropriate to the unit, and that squadrons and detachments are prepared rapidly to despatch further air craft should the situation require this.44816-1 201 4, As shown in paragraph 15 above, each squadron or detachment is primarily responsible for an aircraft zone. At the discretion of the h.A.i. Station, RAMLEH, squadrons of the air striking force are mutually to reinforce each other should this be necessary. The O.C. o« 14(B) Squaaron Detachment will act similarly in every way and will notify the O.C. R.A.F. Station, RAMLEH, if air reinforcement m the Jordan Aircraft Zone is necessary, and alternatively, the O.C. R.A.F. Station, RAIvILEH, may request the O.C. 14 (b) Squadron Detachment to reinforce aircraft answering 'XX calls, particularly in the Northern Aircraft Zone. AI R ACT ION The Machine gun attack to. (a) Under prescribed conditions, air action by machine gun fire can take place over the whole of Palestine. In this relation it should be noted that Bedouin Arabs are entitled to carry fireams and ball ammunition in the area south and east of a line passing from KASR ZOWEIQA on the Dead Sea through RAS ABU KEDAD, RAYADA, RUJM AL BARARA, RAS UADI JERABA, RUJIvi AL BALADI, RUJM AL KAN ASIYA, NAQB RAS EM JULAID, RAS G-KWAIRIB, RAS NAQB GHARID, AIN AL MURRA, WADI IRMEILEH, WADI ABDO to BIR AL HAFIR, and thence due west till it meets the frontier between Palestine and Egypt, which on the l: 250,000 P oc T.J. map is approximately as follows:- QASR ZUWEIRA 12 miles north of west to point 555, 4 miles south to point 287, to KURNAB, to NAQB EL GHARIB, to point 553, point 619, point 359, BIR HAFIR and due west to frontier. (b) Air action by machine gun fire may be taken against that house or those houses in villages (not towns or main centres) from which hostile rifle fire has been directed against aircraft or security forces. The Bomb attack 27. The 20 lb and the 112 lb bombs only are to be used. The attack is to be confined to the 'Diving bombing' method. The diving bombing attack is to be delivered at high speed at a height not less than 1,000 feet. The bomb attack is not to be enployed against minor opposition when machine gun attack would provide the support neces sary, (for example, a party of two or three snipers). It is to be used for breaking the resistance of an armed band or ambuscade prior to the machine gun attack. 28. (a) In the areas defined in attached Map and paragraph 29 below, the bomb attack may be delivered against armed bands operating against the security forces. (b) Under no circumstances is the 20 lb bomb to be dropped within 500 yards or the 112 lb bomb within 750 yards of the outskirts of a town, or village or a building. (c) Aircraft armed with bombs are not to fly over main centres of population or towns. Bombing Areas 29. The areas in which bombs may be dropped are shown in attached Map. These are as follows : - (a) The Northern Aircraft Zone.('b) The Middle Aircraft Zone. (c) The Southern Aircraft Zone. (d) The Jordan Aircraft Zone. A rming o f Air craf t 30. As noted above aircraft may be armed with either the 20 lb or the 112 lb bomb or both, in answer to 'XX' calls or when employed on other duties in bombing areas where offensive action may be necessary. METHOD OF MAKING THE ' XX' CALL 31. The emergency call for air action on the part of the air striking force is the 'XX' call. The 'XX' call is to be given priority over all other traffic. The 'XX” call takes the shortest possible form and com prises the call sign followed by the letters 'XX' and the point at which air support is required. Pbr rapidity in sending, this is described in various ways as explained in paragraph 33 below. Example Call sign Locality 'XX' call PMX XX D41. which means: - To air base at NABLUS Road. 'XX' call at Kilo 41 on the JERUSALEM- 32. The 'GG' Call The 'GG' call will be made in an exactly similar way to the 'XX' call. The 'GG' call is sent at the discretion of the Detachment Commander, to the appropriate Divisional Headquarters, to enable ground striking forces to co-operate in the air action.

H.q. B.F. P. &amp; T.J. OPERATION INSTRUCTION NO, 25 . GENERAL 1 * The time has ^^ived v/hen it is necessary to take stock of our military position, to review the lessons learnt during the last three months, and to formulate plans for the future. THE PROB LEM 2. It is essential to be quite sure in our mind as to the problem with which we are confronted. It is twofold, and differs in no way from that laid down in 'Notes on Imperial Policing' - viz - (a) To prevent interference with the normal life of the country, i.e. to maintain communications, and to protect life and property. (b) io get to grips with the hostile bands and bring them into subjection. 3. (a) and (b) are complementary and both problems must be pursued simultaneously. It must remain the business of Brigade Commanders to see tnat in so far as Military Aid to the Civil Power is concerned, an even balance is preserved. Both (a) and (b) are made unusually diffi cult owing to the existing state of affairs in the Palestinian portion of the Police Force, which necessitates drawing largely on the troops to carry out purely police duties, consequently reducing reserves for offensive action. THE HOSTILE ELEMENTS 4. These may be divided into different classes (a) Leaders and agitators. (b) Intelligence organisation. (c) Intimidators. (d) Saboteurs. (e) Terrorist gunmen or bombers. (f) Armed bands. (g) Signalling organisation. (h) Those engaged in a purely passive attitude. 5. Classes (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) have undoubtedly to be dealt with directly by the troops. Classes (c) and (e) force us largely to employ passive defensive measures, e.g. anti-intimidation patrols in and around the large cities, guards on workmen and vital points, and private property and individuals. Classes (d), (f) and (g) can only be subdued by offensive measures and will be dealt with later.44816-1 208 TA KEN 7/HEN DEALING 1YITH EID IVIDUAL OR SMALL PARTIES OP AjMED XilTElIDATORS ~ v.ir . ^ Armed intimidators consist chiefly of snipers, operating at night with rifles or revolvers; also bombers. There is a tendency at the moment for troops when sniped merely to return the fire v/ith their rifles in the hope_of silencing it. Such action is not only bad for training morale and discipline, but in a very large percentage of cases is a waste of ammunition. Hostile night snipers normally act alone and from behind good cover. They undoubtedly gain a moral uplift, a great deal of amusement, and practically no casualties from the bulk of our return rifle fire. In addition to the above, unaimed rifle fire at night is likely to be a danger to our own troops and civilians, particularly on the outskirts of towns. 7. The aim of infantry is to close with the enemy and kill him at short range with fire or the bayonet. This principle is apt to be lost sight of v/hen troops are employed on policing duties, but if applied correctly will have far more effect on enemy snipers than hundreds of unaimed rounds at long range. The excuse is so often heard that it is impossible to move across country at night. Not only does this cast a reflection on our night training, which is of first importance in modem war, but it shows an ignorance of the night exploits of the British infantry in the Palestine Campaign. As a guiding principle, therefore, fire should not be returned with rifles at snipers at night unless they are at close range and can definitely be located. The best form of reply is concentrated machine gun, accompanied by pom-pom or 3-pdr fire. TChere this cannot be organised snipers are to be dealt with by the offensive action of small patrols consisting of a few lightly clad men carrying the minimum of equipment necessary, and if possible wearing ruboer-soled shoes, either in ambush positions or working round the flanks or rear of snipers positions. One or two rifle grenades should be carried to deal with snipers in sangars or other good cover. ACTION TO BE TAKEN AGAINST SABOT EURS 8. ^ Saboteurs may be members of armed gangs, or inhabitants of villages living close to the main roads and railways. In any case, the action of saboteurs is almost entirely directed against communications, whether it be the roads and railways themselves, the vehicles and personnel which move along them; or the telegraph lines which run beside them. Sabotage may be prevented by one of the following methods:- (a) Ambushes by night. (b) Picquetting by day or night, or both. (c) Patrolling by A.P.V’s. with or v/ithout infantry by night. (d) Patrolling oy infantry in M.I. or railway trolley cars and armoured trucks by night. (c) and (d) both have definite disadvantages but there is no doubt that railway patrols are necessary for inspection of the permanent way before normal traffic is resumed. No form of patrolling by itself is ever going to prevent sabotage of communications in this country, and it remains to be seen whether we have now reached a stage where a system of picquets on vital portions of our communications combined with patrolling and ambushing will lead to the best results. Such a system has the advantage o± combining both defensive measures v/ith offensive, of denying certain blocks oi country to enemy action, and what is more, of securing the roads and railways.44816-1 209 PICQUETTING 9. A cursory examination of the available infantry forces in Palestine proves conclusively that a continuous system of picquetting such as is a adopted on the North-West frontier of India is quite impossible. The Northern Brigade has found it necessary already by day to picquet certain portions of the following main roads in order to keep them open:- (a) Road JENIN - DEIR SHARAF - NABLUS - KHAN LUEBAN. (b) Road DEIR SHARAF - TULKARM. 10. Commander, Southern Brigade, has picquetted certain portions of the RAMALLAH - KHAN LUBBAN road between kilos 22 and 42, picquets being supplied by a company encamped on the spur just West of Kilo 28. The JERUSALEM - LYDDA railway between AL WALAGA and ARTUF has also been picquetted. In addition to the above, the A.O.C. wishes Commander, Southern Brigade, to consider picquetting of the main JERUSALEM - JAFFA road (plus the JERUSALEM water pipe line) between DISKAN Orphanage and BAB EL WAD. 11. Picquets should be self-contained and entrenched or ’'sangared”. 12. It remains to be proved whether the best system is to establish picquets by day only, withdrawing them by M.T. before nightfall, or to live on the ground relieving picquetting troops frequently. Both systems have the merit of providing a M bait M for the enemy as the picquets move into position, whereas the latter has the added advantage of keep ing an area quiet and of preventing night sabotage as well. PATROLLING IN MOTOR VEHICLES AT NIG HT 13. Where night patrols on roads are necessary it has been found by experience that the best results are achieved by employing A.F./'s either with the Naval pom-pom or 3-pdr., and a searchlight. The use of infantry patrols in unarmoured M.T. is to be discontinued. It is unsound to run the risk of casualties when we can employ vehicles impervious to S.A. fire. 14. If road blocks are met by A.F.V’s. and Naval artillery detachments the fire of the latter has been found quite sufficient to ’’bolt' the enemy, who can then be dealt with by the machine guns of the A.F.V s. assisted by the searchlight. The following formation appears to be the most suitable:- Armoured Car. Pom-pom or 3-pdr lorry. Searchlight lorry. Armoured Car, ^ o All vehicles carrying a small extra complement of infantry whose duty is to look for enemy casualties, their arms and ammunition, and examine enemy positions after firing has ceased. ACTION TO BE TAKEN AGAINST ARMED BANDS 15 So far, experience shows the action of armed bands to be confined almost entirely to ambushes and attacks by fire action on motor vehicles moving on the main roads. There has been one attack on a picquet moving into position. Such attacks may be divided into.- (a) Night Attacks. (b) Day Attacks.44816-1 210 16. Night attacks usually take the fora of an ambush of an anti sabotage patrol and should be dealt with as described in paras. 13 and 14 17. They may also occur against infantry in M.T. moving from camp or billets to carry out a night operation or returning therefrom. In such cases A.F.V’s. should escort whenever possible, their action being to engage enemy ambushers by fire while the infantry M.T. column continues its movement. But such movements should be restricted to a minimum. Lorries thus emplo 3 ’ r ed are never to move singly. Ambush patrols should not be embussed and moved back to their stations during darkness. 18. ^ Where A.F.V's. are not available the normal protection precautions laid down in “Notes on Imperial Policing”, Chapter IV, Sec.II, para. 7 (page 25), must always be adopted. 19. Such action it may be argued, merely tends to slow down the move ments of^the infantry and prevent them reaching their destination in time. In this type of guerilla warfare, however, where the greatest difficulty of all is to find the enemy and bring him to action, every opportunity must be sought of closing with him. 20. Day attacks are usually made on buses, and cars travelling alone or in convoy, or on telegraph line repair gangs. In other words the bus or convoy provides a “bait” for the armed bands. Almost every occasion on which armed bands have been successfully dealt with has been the result of attacks as described above. 21. The io-ea-l to aim at is the immediate 'fixing” of the armed band either by M.G-., mortar or air action - or by the two former alone if air craft are not immediately present until they arrive - followed by an infantry striking^ force which must immediately surround the enemy if it is to achieve decisive success. 22.^ The gradual obliteration of bands will go a long way towards res- onng law and order, but it must be remembered that whilst air action alone will-probably cause considerable enemy casualties, only ground action acting in co-operation with the air can kill or capture rebels and secure their arms and ammunition. This latter is most important and infantry must myariabiy endeavour to get to the scene of an air action if the aircraft indicates it has pinned the enemy, or casualties with 23. The introduction of a picquetting system over the most dangerous portions of the main roads will undoubtedly restrict the enemy's attacks on^convoys, ouses and cars, but at the same time the picquets themselves may o fer a bait . The dual problem of securing the main roads from ° f inducin £ the enem y to come into the open in daylight is a ^ 1GU u 0 ^ le » in e answer may be to allow unrestricted movement of M.T. along che picquetted portions of the main roads, but at the present moment the A.O.C. does not consider it safe to allow the daily and other convoys - e.g. rations - to move unprotected. GROUND STRIKING FORCES ha f proved that the ground striking forces situated in UU-bAPavi uABLJS and JENIN have proved sufficient for the main roads in tne Northern Brigade Area. In tne Southern Brigade the only portions of main roads over which groun striking forces have had to act to deal with the armed bands attack ing motor traffic, are as follows:- JERUSALEM - BAB EL NAD. JERUSALEM - KHAN LUBBAN. JERUSALEM - JERICHO.44816-1 211 The ground striking force for (a) is normally situated at ARZA, while that for (b) and (c) is JERUSALEM. 25. The A.O.C. wishes Commander, Southern Brigade, to place a ground striking force at RAMALLAH to deal with the JERUSALEM - L KHAN LUBBAN section and to link up with the Northern Brigade striking force at NABLUS. 26. In the case of the JERUSALEM - JERICHO road, the ground although hilly? is more devoid of cover and lends itself much better to air action. The chief target which the enemy has chosen up to date on this road is the Potash Convoy which is accompanied by a W/T vehicle. At the present moment, air action has had a salutary effect on the band operating about Kilo 14, but should further and stronger enemy action develop it may be necessary for the Commanders, Southern Brigade and JORDAN Area, to organise ground striking forces in their areas. CONVOYS. 27. The daily convoys from JERUSALEM and KEFR SABA will continue to run as heretofore with the following modifications. 28. Provision of Escorts Commanders Northern and Southern Brigades will each provide escorts within their own boundaries, except that Commander, Northern Brigade, will assume responsibility for the whole of the KEFR SABA route. Each escort will provide one courier for Official Mail service. 29. Size and Composition of Escorts Now that the most dangerous portions of the convoy routes are picquetted during running hours the chances of attack are considerably diminished. We can, therefore, reduce the size of the infantry portion of the escort. In order to ensure complete safety however, and the ’'fixing 1 ' of the enemy should the convoy be strongly attacked, escorts will be composed as follows. An armoured car will move at the head and tail of each convoy. If armoured cars are not available their places should be taken by trucks, preferably armoured, carrying M.G-s. or L.As. The second vehicle in the convoy will carry just sufficient men for the sole duty of removing barricades and road blocks. OneW/T vehicle v/ill travel in each convoy. A vehicle carrying a mortar, pom-pom or 3-pdr should, whenever available, travel 100 - 200 yards in rear of each convoy. The object of this vehicle is to provide 'fixing' fire until the arrival of air and ground striking forces. 50. Procedure whenattacked (a) If the enemy fire is slight, i.e. sniping, or distant, the convoy must not halt, machine guns or light automatics returning the fire whilst still on the move. The 'XX' call will not be sent out. (b) If the fire is heavy or close, i.e. there is a chance of rounding up the armed band, the following procedure will be adopted:- (i) Vehicles with light automatics, machine guns, mortars, pom-poms or 3-pdrs., will pull into the side of the road and then pin the enemy with fire. (ii) TheW/T lorry will send out the 'XX' call.(iii) If there is no road block the second vehicle with troops will lead the convoy straight on without halting. If there is a road block, troops in the second lorry will remove it and lead the convoy on. (iv) G-round strips will be laid at once to indicate to the air striking force the direction of the enemy. (v) The ground striking force commander on approaching the scene of the action, will halt the striking force out of sight of the enemy'and go forward in his car to reconnoitre. (vi) Having finished his reconnaissance, the ground striking force commander will lead his force forward to the best positions from which he can surround the enemy. It must always be his main object to get behind the enemy rather than attack him frontally. This requires a good knowledge of the ground on either side of the road and a careful study of the map beforehand. (vii) In-co-operation with the air striking force and the M fixing” fire of the weapons accompanying the convoy, the ground striking force will develop the attack. AIR SUPPORT 31. Up to date the support given by the air striking force has been excellent and undoubtedly has enabled the infantry to close with the enemy and in some cases surround him. Pilots consider, however, that their action would be quicker and more effective if more use is made by ground forces of the ground’signal code, particularly when pointing out the direction of the enemy. 32. If the present system requires speeding up in any way, or should air action be required in the North beyond that which 14 Squadron is able to supply, the possibility of using TULKARM, JENIN and NABLUS landing grounds must be explored. 3o’. I/lien ever information indicates the likelihood of serious ambush, aircraft must be overhead and ready to strike on a signal from the column. ACTION T O J^ j^AKEIg AGA MST HOSTILE SIG-N ALLERS .j 4. In view of the present restrictions imposed by the G-ovemment, this problem becomes one of great difficulty. Other than actually arresting a person caught H in flagrante delicto” and handing him over to the police, there appears to be no solution. (Sgd) J. P.
