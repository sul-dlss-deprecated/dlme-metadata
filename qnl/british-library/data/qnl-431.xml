In response to Kemball's request for guidance, Goldsmid encloses a letter (no.177) from C. Allen, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, to Goldsmid, dated 10 May 1853. In his letter, Allen suggests following the course of action proposed by Colonel Sheil [Her Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at the Court of Persia] in his letter dated 8 August 1851. Allen states that the British Government 'would not admit' the occupation of Bahrain by Turkish forces, or anyone acting in Turkish interests, and that the Government of India would therefore offer 'every obstacle' to an attack on Bahrain by the Wahhabis.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
