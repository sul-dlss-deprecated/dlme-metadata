I understand that Abdul Aziz al Bassam has tried to buy this land in order to prevent this nuisance but the owner refuses to sell it at any price. In the interests of health may the Baladjah be approached to take steps to keep this land irom being used tor purposes of relieving nature. I should like to point out that my wife and Nanny,myself, and one servant have had diahorrea recently (in my case a touch of dysentery) due quite probably according to Doctor Holmes to this nuisance. In addition I should like to draw your attention to the fact that immediately behind the Assistant Political Agent’s house there are some divers dwellings and surface wells. Doctor Holmes has seen uhese. Doctor Dame remarked to me during the hot weather that unless I could close the wells I stood a very good chance of . getting malaria. Judging by the number of mosquitoes in and about the house I fear that Doctor Dame’s prediction may come true. Gould some suitable action be taken in this case too.

It would be preferable, too, if the people could use an outside latrine, but failing this, one latrine site could be made on the south side of the area, and the occupants of the burasties made responsible for its cleanliness. The owner of the area should be made to remove all the stones or pile them in one section, so as to expose the whole area to as much sunlight as possible. This would also prevent scattered latrines and ablution sites. 10 . The refuse dump could be covered ever. Medical Officer-in-Charge, Victoria Memorial Hospital, Bahrain.
