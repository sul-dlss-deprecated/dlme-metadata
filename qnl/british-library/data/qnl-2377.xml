I The previous^papers dealing with Mrs.Howson*s case are at P.Z.6C23/$0 flagged in the file below, where it will be seen that she was granted a gratuity of Rs.7,5C0. The grounds for the grant(i&amp;re stated in India e^^sae letter of 8th January 192®, No.P.773/20, and it will be seen that the Treasury considered them sufficiently exceptional to justify them in accepting half the cost - see Foreign Office letters of the 3rd % June, on P.4448/20 and 9th August 1920, on P.6023/20. Mrs.Howson has now applied for a further grant of at least £250 to enable her to meet the cost of her son’s maintenance until his arrival in India. The Government of India in their letter below consider that sufficient grounds exist for the grant of some financial assistance and recommend the grant of £100, subject to a moiety being borne by His Majesty’s Government. Although the circumstances of the case seem to be sufficiently exceptional to warrant a grant being made fran Indian Revenues, it seems doubtful whether the Treasury will feel themselves called upon to accept any share of it. Nevertheless it is proposed, as in the draft below, to ask the Foreign Office to accept moiety of the proposed grant. ruku^ ^!2531 59°° 2 - 3 * duty/ r C7 Draft Paper. political Department.
