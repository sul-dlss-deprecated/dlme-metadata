L. A copy is also enclosed (in Arabic and Englishj of the communication by the Late Euler,His Excellency Shaikh Isa bin all hi /Qialifah,gifting the land to tne British Government 3. I do not think tnat it is appropriate for the British Government to transfer the land to a private Company without the express consent of the iiuler of Bahrain. 4. Nor am 1 sure tnat such a transfer is expedient. It is possible that circumstances may change,and even tiiat the Company may come under the control (in fact if not in theory; of persons not friendly to ourselves. Moreover,the site is a valuable one and if,in the process of time,less space is required for wireless purposes,it is possible that the Company might claim the right to dispose oi it,and so make a profit, which should rightfully fall to the Bahrain Government. b. In the circumstances I think that it ould be .aser to reserve the right of the British Government to the groundand to inform the Imperial ana International Communications Company Limitea tnat the British Government are prepared to allow them to use the ground in the same circumstances in which the Indo-Siuropean Telegraph Department had the use of it. 6 . For our purposes,we might consider that to mean (aj that the ground should be used as a lelegraph Station and ^b) tnat the Company would not act in a way against the interests of the Bahrain Government or oi His ilajesty f s Government.

H^had thought of some land just north of the Shaikh’s palace where there are football grounds. This area is within 1000 yprds of the existing Telegraph Office and in any case the Shaikh would not like this piece of ground in front of his palace to be built over. 3. I suggested the old Royal Air Force landing ground. It should be possible to fit in their requirements in this eree which is about 2000 yards from the Telegraph station or if a larger area rather to the south is used say 2 miles. In the course of conversation it appeared that the comp? ny would be prepared either to buy or rent land. Personally 1 think that renting for a long period would be more satisfactory possibly from the Company’s and certainly from the Bahrain Government’s point of view. 4. I have spoken to the Adviser who thinks that the Shaikh would raise no difficulty in principle to giving them land on rent and suggested two other possible sites to the west and south-west of the palace fort. 5* I propose to talk the matter over with Mr. Bunker at Bushire and the best thing would obviously be for him to in come *nd see the l&amp;nd, /II the lend^Question is, I think Bahrain Government land so that private rights should not cone into the matter. It is just possible in or or two places that Shaikh Muhammad may put forward some claim. 6.

Dear Colonel Loch, We are rather at loss about the final arrange ments for the new telegraph station. When Bunker was here he settled on the position but not on the actual site. Bottomley only knows the position vaguely. No arrangement was made about leasing or buying part of the ground but I told Bunker that we would sell 100 x 100 yards for the actual buildings for Rs 2,500/-. I told him that it would cost about £250. per annum to lease the circle surrounding the buildings. That is as far as we got. Bottomley has now received a wire referring to the site as though it was settled. Could you obtain alfty more definite information as to whether they wish to purchase the square and/or rent the circle? I think Bunker referred the whole aetter to higher authority. In the meantime we are putting up the land line but cannot complete it till the final site is decided on. Yours sincerely, Lieut. Colonel G.

Yours sincerely. ilryisple Bel grave 1 squire, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.(incorporated in enqland) Dear Colonel Loch, Further to my demi-official letter dated November‘1 st. 1955* On the Adviser to the Bahrain Government informing me that, for approximately a thousand feet around the site which we are considering purchasing for our new radio station, the rental, for a lease of 25 years, would be about £ 250/- per annum, I telegraphed to my Head Office. They have asked if instead of renting this 1000 ft radius it would not be possible to arrange with the land-lord that he would undertake to insert a clause in any sale or lease that a purchaser or lessee must not within one thousand feet of our station erect any building or make any act which would cause interference to our Wireless Station. A suitable payment to be made by us for this agreement. Occupation of land by for example gardens - other than date groves - would not cause interference. As you are aware, the sole reason for renting or purchasing this land is to avoid future interference to our sensitive D.F.Apparatus. The rental of £ 250/- per annum is rather a large one to pay for this purpose, particularly if occupation of this land is not likely to come for several years.If it is not possible to arrange for any such clause to be inserted, what would be the purcha price for this land. (?Z/3 . Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E. Political Agent, Bahrain,V j '' x&gt; \ \ On the S6th November 1955 a meeting i/vas held on the area of ground west of the Police fort at which the Political Agent, the Adviser to the B ahrain u overnment, Mr. ^teele (State Engineer), Mr. Bottomley and Mr. Faithful (Cable and Vireless Limited) and Mr. Muhammad Khalil (Land Eepartment) were present, Mr. Bottomley had pegged out a square of one hundred yards which is v hat the C oirl p an y vhich to purchase out right and also the area over which they wish to prevent buildings being made. 5. It was agreed that there would be no objection in principle (and the °haikh is understood to have agreed to it) to the diversion of the road to the north side of this open space, by doing so a fairly straight run on to the main sea road is obtained as the diverted road joins the main road running from Na ! im to Sakhit which leads on to the sea road east of Manamah. It v r as decided that the land department should produce an estimate of the cost of diverting the road and that Mr. Lteele should produce an estimate for diverting the telephone line to the label, which would have to be done with the consent of 1'he ♦ Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, w/ho wish to extend the line to eight lines. 5, The question of who was to pay for the diversion of the road and telephone line was touched upon and it was generally felt that the diversion should be paid for by the Company as they were the people wiio wished to have it done. 6. Mr. Bottomley was asked to find out quite clearly what the position was regarding the open ground, in which connection I produced Mr. Bunker ! s letter dated the 23rd November 1935. It was decided that he should put to the Company an enquiry whether there would be any objection :t (a) to orange trees or similar size trees, (b) to barastis, and (c) stone and mud huts, provided they contain no metal.All three of up to a height of, say 15 feet as a maximum. 7. It is impossible to do more until the two estimates are received (Mr. Steele’s will be sent to the Adviser, who will send it to me with a copy to Mr. Bottomley) and until the Company’s opinion is known as to what can be grown on the open area. 8. We should aw'ait further communications from the Company and the Bahrain Government.

The cost of earthing the telephone line will be approximately Rs 1,200/-. I enclose a copy of Steele’s letter on this subject. Yours sincerely, Lieut. Colonel G.

Bottoiriley and . Belgrrve on the subject of the former's letter No:°0/Z3 dated the 30th November 1935. It vas decided that dr. Bottomley should see the open ground near the landing ground at ^uharraq in company with dp. Bteele, v&gt;ho would show him i here the tele phone and possible power line were to run. 2. On the 4th December 1935 Mr. Bottomley caise to see me and said that the ^uharran site would not be suitable, partly because of the rent for a house, and partly because so much of the land vas taken up by the B 0 yal ia ir Force, who in any case would probably object to having an high aerial mast so near by. He said that he had also been out along the Jabal road and that there was a site at the end of the date groves to the left of the Hanamah-Jabal Dukhan road about 5.6 miles away from the proposed site near the Police Fort. Mr. Bottomley is to write in continuation of his letter IIo:°0/34 of the 30th November 1935 to enquire from the ^ahrain Government what the purchase price of a 300 feet square would be and the'rent of an area 1000 feet clear from each side of the square would be*- (a) at the site pegged out at the north-west of the Police r 6rt, and (b) on the east side of the road to the Jabal beyond the palm belt. I said that he should make quite clear with a sketch what area he wanted and also that he should state that trees and huts could not be grown on the rented areas but that ordinary low; cultivation could be. ' I asked him also to make clear about the period for which the lease would be required, which is apparently 10 years or if possible 15 years. 3. Mr. Bottomley wall let me have a letter as soon as nossible. I have made it clear to him that we must have a cut and dry proposal to enable the ^ahrain Government to give a firm answer.

The conversation based itself on the Adviser's letter No:555/1^ L.D dated the 12th January 1936, the contents of which the Adviser made known to Mr. B 0 ttomley. Mr. Bottomley said that he w r ould like a copy of the letter. The Adviser stated that he had no objection to his having it. I said that I would note the fact for the Political Agent T s information. 2. Mr. Bottomley then made his alternative proposal to paragraph No:l of the above mentioned letter, hereinafter referred to as Tt the letter”. Mr. Bottomley asked:~ (a) for a guarantee that the protection area would not be built on for the next four years during which time the Company would pay no rent, (b) that after four years the Company would pay a pro gressively increasing rent for the protection area commencing at £.100/- p.a and increasing by £.10 p.a for 10 years, and (c) that at any time the Company should have the first option of buying the protection area, i.e., should the land or part of it be offered for sale the Company should have first refusal. Mr. Belgrave replied that the Shaikh would probably agree to (a) and that he would consult the Shaikh about the other points tomorrow and reply through the Political Agent. 3. As regards the second paragraph of the letter m r. Beigrave said that the value of land had reached its low water mark and that everyone was confidently expecting an appreciation of land prices, especially about Manamah in view of the expansions in connection with oil. The Shaikh did not wish to sell the protected area, but if Manamah expanded it would be difficult to deny this land for building purposes unless the Company either bought or rented it.2 4. As regards paragraph 3 of the letter. %ere is no intention of fencing. Mr. Bottomley explained that fencing upset the direction finding apparatus. 5.

Sir iy- I ha-^e the honour to refer to my conversation on Tuesday with the Assistant Political Agent and Mr. Bottomley regarding the land required for the new Telegraph Station. I discussed the matter with His Excellency Shaikh Hamad on Wednesday last. His Excellency considers that the amount asked as rent is not excessive and he is not preoared to reduce « the rent unless the period of the lease is reduced. If the period of the lease is reduced to five years His Excellency will reduce the rent to &lt;€l00/-per annum for five years instead of &lt;*£190/- per annum for ten-fifteen years. His Excellency considers that all land in the vicinity of the capital has great potential value. His Excellency is prepared to reduce the cost price of Site No.2, on the Hafa road from Hs 30,000/- to Hs 20,000/-, or, in Sterling^1500/-, provided that the transaction does not contravene any of the clauses of the Oil Concession Agreement.

IV Dear Sir, fith reference to your letter ^oi20/40 dated the 2nd January 1336 and to your conversation with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Assistant Political Agent on the 14th January 1936 and with the Assistant Political Agent and myself on the 2?rd January 1336, I write to inform you that your proposal made at the former interview, that is to sayi- (a) for a guarantee that the protection area would not be built on for the next four* years during which time your Company would pay no rent, (b) that after four years your Company would pay a progressively increasing rent for the protection area commencing at £ 100 a year and increasing by £ 10 a year for 10 years, and (c) that at any time your Company should have the first option of buying the protection area., i.e., should the land or part of it be offered for sale your Company should have first refusal was placed before His Excellency Shaikh lir Hamad bin *Isa A1 Khaiifah by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. 2. His Excellency considers that the amount asked as rent (sec my letters No;C/608-17/1 dated the 15th December 1335 and No:C/€95-17/l dated the 2°nd December 1985) is not excessive and he is not prepared to reduce the rent unless the period of the lease is reduced. If the period of the lease is reduced to five years, His Excellency will reduce the rent to £ 100 a year for five years instead of £ 190 a year for ten to fifteen years. His Excellency considers that all land in the vicinity has great potential value. a?. I should explain that the reduced fxy&amp;ent of ^loO is quoted in place of the figure mentioned in ay letter Ko:C/608-17/1 dated the 15th Ceee-nber 1- S8 to allow for the srea of ICO yards square rhich the Company }propose to buy* 4* His Txcellency is prepared to reduce the cost r rice of Cite ^o:0 on the Baffe f road from 1 TO,000/- to % ’0,000/- or in sterling £ 1,500, provided that the transaction does not contravene any of the clauses of the Oil Concession agree ment. He is also Filling to reduce the rent of - tte i*Gt2 from £ 75 a year to £ 50 a year. 5. The Bahrain Government state that they cannot give e definite opinion as to the possibility of the protection area in Manamah being occupied, but that this area, and the neighbourhood north of Cadhelbiyah ere the only areas avail able for building if the tov.n of Manaxoah expands. They con sider that it is very probable that the town will extend within a Ter- years in which case they would be willing to sell plots of land west of the Fort as building sites.

MEMORAITOtM : pole****/ In reference to my conversation of t^s/morning with the Assistant Political Agent; I understand i&amp;at Cable and Wireless Limited are now prepared by their local attorney to complete the proposed agreement for the tenancy of the Protected Area. 2. In reference to clause (v) of this agreement, the Superintendent of the Land Department informs me that the road at the western end has been closed, and the new road has been duly made, and is available for traffic. 3. I am arranging with the State Engineer for the prompt removal of the alignment of the poles of the present telephone line to the Jebel; and will inform you when this is effected. 4. The Adviser desires that the agreed rent shall be paid in sterling in London, under advice to him here. 5. In regard to'the marking of the boundary, as mentioned in clause (vi), the Adviser thought that perhaps a suitable method in the interest of Cable and Wireless Limited, would be a ditch. I therefore suggest that it might be well for the Superintendent of the Land Department to meet the local Attorney of Cable and Wireless Limited, and settle this point, if you approve. e Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.0 23 ' : FP. 1936 a 0 •S I The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:— The Assistant Political Agent , --ahrain. &lt;ie&gt;i and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s).

Mr. deGrenier arrived first and pointed out that the words ”give a', inserted in red ink in paragraph (iii) the Agency copy of the draft agreement, were not included in the copy sealed by Sir Hamad. He therefore declined to insert the alteration in the three copies to be faired, as requested by Mr. Bottomley (see (d) of my letter C/2455 of 28th September). 2. On the other hand, he offered that if Officer-in-Charge, Cable and Wireless Limited, signed the draft agreement as local attorney, he would order the work of enclosure to be put in hand at once; but w-ould not require rent on behalf of the Bahrain Government until the 1st October, on the understanding that Mr. Bottomley signed the final agreement on that date. 5.
