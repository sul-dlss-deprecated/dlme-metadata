In the letter William Bruce insists that it was not his intention to cause his employers umbrage, and he outlines his history of service with the East India Company, which he hopes will mitigate any decision the court makes in his favour.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023685574.0x0000a3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
