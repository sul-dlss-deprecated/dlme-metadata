He explains how after a directorship post at the American Research Center in Egypt and teaching early in his career at Canada’s McGill University he joined AUC as Director of its Center for Arabic Studies, a post he held until 1972.  Williams speaks of his involvement in the development of the Center for Arabic Study Abroad and Islamic Art and Architecture program at AUC, and describes faculty in Arabic Studies including architecture scholar K.A.C. Creswell. Changes in the AUC student body, teaching issues, and notable students graduating from AUC’s programs are also mentioned. The university’s leadership and relationship with Egyptian government authorities in the 1960s, and the evacuation of foreigners at the time of the 1967 War are also discussed.  Williams tells about his arrangement to have joint tenure AUC and the University of Texas, Austin, from the 1970s, and shares his experience of getting married (to Islamic architecture scholar Caroline Williams) and raising children in Egypt.  His research interests are also addressed.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
