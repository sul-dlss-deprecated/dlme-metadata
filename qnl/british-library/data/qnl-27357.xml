A Dear Caroe, i ( i U '1 i I o/q 3 I enclose for your information a copy of a Demi- Official letter No. S. 2079 dated the 13th Dece mber, 19 44, from Galloway. I am Very glad indeed to hear of the greatly improved relations with the Sultan, but there are two points in this letter to which I should like to draw your attention. ! 2. You will notice that in paragraph 2 the Sultan recalled his old associations with Galloway. This is quite typical, and it was with the realisation of this Arab habit in mind that I went out of my way when Political Agent, Bahrain, to call on the young Saiyid Said, who was then a school boy, in Karachi. I gathered the fruits of this visit many years later. It was for this reason too that I took Rogers with me to Muscat a year ago, as I regarded him as a potential Consul for Muscat. Similarly, the Shaikh of Kuwait mentioned the other day his early meetings, with me in Bahrain, and some civility I had shown him then. All this goes to illustrate how valuable old and long associations with Arab rulers are. Time casts a roseate hue even over * unpleasant shadows and when I met Abu Dhabi as Political Resident fifteen years after coercing him over the Yas Island installation and introduced myself as his ’’old friend” he seemdd glad to renew the acquaintance. 3. You will notice that in paragraphs 5 and 5 the Sultan consulted Galloway freely regarding the administration of the S''ate and made no attempt to stress his independence. You will recall that when Jackson was Assistant Political Agent, at Salalah the Sultan allowed him to draft all his letters to the Americans and generally conduct his relations with them. So long as the approach is made in the right way, and his position preserved at all times I think he would be only too ready to let the Political Agent run the State for him and save him the trouble of doing so. Kuwait is in a similar position. When HIckinbotham was Political Agent there he was more or less in complete control and the Shallfh expressed the warmest approval of his ' assistance”. I have bothered you with all this to show that the G^lf is, indeed, as Fowle once observed a peculiar place. to Peel. I am sending a copy of this enclosure Yours sincerely, Sd. GEOFFREY PRIOR.

No. 3 2079 the 13th December, 1944. My dear Sir Geoffrey, With reference to my recent visit to, Salalah I am writing to inform you of the Sujl$ 2 foRs attitude in general, and to report briefly conversrertibns which are of interest from the point of view of our relations. 2. The Sultan received me in a very friendly manner, (which attitude he maintained), and recalled old associations. He took the trouble to _ search out and give me a copy of a photograph he had taken of a shooting competition in which wo both took part in Muscat in 1939. He invited me to dinner and lunch, and took me out gazelle shooting and to Mamura where he gave me tea. He also put a car at my disposal. The proposed duck shoot fell through. 3. On one occasion during conversation he told me that he had received complaints about the sale and distribution of clpth which, he said, was causing unrest. He s a id that he would be very grateful if I would look into the matter for him. 4. At another time he told me that Saiyid Shah a b, the Minister for External Affairs, was pressing to be permitted to make a personal report. The dultan was averse to a visit, and asked me if I knew what the trouble was. I said that I did not, but imagined that it was connected with the High Price Relief Fund which I knew needed adjustment. His Highness decided to write a letter to 3aiyid Shahad, and asked me if I would arrange for an air passage for him if he asked me later on. The Sultan thought, however, that his letter would close the matter. 5. The Sultan told me how difficult it was for him to organise a satisfactory form of Government for Muscat while he was in Dhofar. He said that when he was present in Muscat he co-ordinated the various departments, but in his absence they al] worked independently. The Sultan’ seems to be giving considerable thought to Muscat, and was more frank than I could h n ve expected. 6. The Sultan made no suggestion of the independence of his State and used the term '‘agency” in conversation and not 'consulate” as, I believe, he often does. My general impression is that he would welcome close co-operation between himself and the Political Agent, Yours sincerely Sd. A.C. GALLOWAY.

Please see the Political Resident's letter below. This reveals the existence of somewhat unsatisfactory relations between the Political Agent and the Sultan. At the end of his letter Sir Geoffrey Prior states, however, that CAfrdfc Metcalfe has nov/ reported that the Sultan is much more co-operative. As the Resident says, it is certainly unfortunate that this state of affairs should have arisen at the present moment f when we are on the point of entering into important negotiations with him for the lease or purchase of Masirah Island. The papers referred to in paragraph 2 (2) are flagged in the attached files. The papers at PZ 7769/37 are also relevant to the general question of the Sultan's independence. It is clear that the only control which we have over his policy, whether foreign or internal, is by custom and not by any legal right, unless we count the letter v/hich he wrote on his succession to the Political Resident, in which he declared: 'I will be guided by the British Government's views in important matters as I an assured that the Government will not be pleased except in what profits my State and desires the maintenance of the independence of our Government and Sultanate'. Sir Olaf Caroe's comments are contained in his telegram No. 2055 below. He draws particular attention to the Resident's transport difficulties which render it impossible for him to supervise very closely his Political Agent's activities. Papers on this question /were- v COPY D.O, No&gt;G/1539 . Muscat. 26th November 1943. SUBJECT i DATES. In continuation of our conversation this morning on the supply of cheap dates, I understand that the present retail priie per bahar is over Rs. 200 whereas the price in normal times would be Rs* 25 or less. I think you will agree that this piice, especially when coupled with the present exchange rate, is absolutely prohibitive. 2. So far as I can see the price of imported foodstuffs, which is already very high and beyond the reach of the poorer people, is not likely to drop in the near future and it therefore seems essential that e sh-ould devise some scheme to ensure a cheap and regular supply of dates* I understand that you have already taken steps in this direction on behalf of Dhofar, the Batinah and Sur can \ . look after themselves and we are therefore mainly concerned with Muscat and Matrah for which purpose some four hundred tons of cheap dates for the remainder of the year would be U' sufficient. Last year exports of this type of dates amonted to 4,000 tons and there are therefore so far as I can see two alternative schemes. 3. The first scheme would be to require each exporting merchant (there ere some 17 big merchants engaged in this trade, of whom 8 are Arabs and the remainder British) to give to your Government 10# of all his exports to be sold at a cheap price which would be fixed. Any losses that he may incur he can add to the export price of the .remainder# Eor Example, supposing a merchant purch4tses from the grower at Rs. 150 a bahar and you fix the local selling price at Rs. 50 a bahar, the loss incurred would be a hundred rupees a bahar (approximately Rs. 50,000 for 400 tons). This would then be distributed over the thethe 3,600 tons remaning for export and would mean an increase in the export price of about Rs. 14 per ton, which in my opinion would not affect export adversely* The dates can then be sold from a Government shop at the controlled price* i/ Alternately the State can bear the loss in the first instance by a subsidy of approximately half a lakh of rupees and recoup if Self by imposing an export duty of Rs. 14 per ton. 5. In either event the grower would still receive his increased prices, the exporting merchant would not suffer and the local people would benefit. .6 Of course the above figures are only approximate and exact details will require to be worked out but I would be very grateful for your opinion on the above in the first instance. 7. I need hardly emphasise that this matter is of great importance and urgency, as large quantities of dates are si ready awaiting export.

Hence his enquiry whether the Government of % India would be willing to come to his help financially in return for the cession of Gwadur. Captain Hickinbotham naturally did not commit himself on this question. In his accompanying comments he suggests three possibilities. (1) To buy Gwadur .

The Political Resident in his covering letter is obviously inclined to dismiss the whole suggestion as capricious and ill-considered on the Sultan’s part, and 4 s impossible of entertainment on our own. The legal position cannot be overlooked and is perhaps decisive. The Political Agent refers to the anglo-French Declaration of 186? respecting the independence of Muscat and Zanzibar, whereby we and the French engaged reciprocal 1 y to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat (and the Sultan of Zanzibar), vide Aitchison XI, page 304. Any decision to establish a formal protectorate over Muscat or to modify the Sultan's existing Dominions would necessitate the ucqroyati sin of this Declaration (and perhaps of the Commercial Treaty of 1844 between France and Muscati.

He had thought that by peaceful means alone he would be able to carry out his plan successfully but that now he had come to the conclusion that he must have force as well as fufrds* He anticipated that he would require a force (permanent) of 1,000 m«n to reassert his authority and main tain control.

His Highness thought that the ceding of Gwadur would cause some oonrojent in the interior but not sufficient to materially affect his prestige* He felt that it was a question of Gwadur or Oman and Oman was the more important* 10* On more than one occasion His Highness remarked that he was tired of the present state of affairs and that if financial aseistance was not forthcoming he would leave matters V ^ to sought themselves out* If he had had a son he scu-'c «h&lt;At t»he position would be diffsrsnt* If he did leave he had no ,, ^ ^idea who would follow in hi» footstep*.

The alternatives h re i* (a) . To accede to His Highness*e request and make a substantial financial contribution in return for Gwadur. (b) . To refuse further financial assistance. (o). To take over control of the State of Muscat and Oman* His Highness would retain the title and control of the province of Dhofar. In addition he would receive a reasonable stipend from the Muscat revenues.• 6 - The first of these alternatives meane the grant to ie Highneee of a very ooneiderable turn of money in return for very ' little* the revenue this year from Geadur #ill probably amount to i*a#70#000 aa opposed to Re*!,03^000 y^ar* i ai una le to speak on the subjeot of the value of Gwadur to India or rather to Kalat State but it is clear that the Tall in revenuf * , Vv r ls largely due to the iUlat blockade which should Gwadur revert stcJv * Kalat *1X1 be removed with a resulting Improvement in the revenue* The Sultan oonsiders that the revenue fro* Oman will compensate him for the loss of Gwadur arid will meet the addit ional expenditure on the maintenance of his standing army of one thousand men. He hopes to further improve his financial position by introducing a customs preventive service to et evasion of duty. I feel that His Highness is overestimating for 1 do not consider that the Oman revenue will meet these extra commitments. It may bs possible to develop theoountry andthus increase its revenue but surveys must be made first and a capital sum will be required to meet the cost of develop ment. iiears must pass before a return can be expected. I believe that the grant of a large sum of money will be only putting off the crisis for a year or two. 14. The second alternative is to do nothing or rather to tycrO C . ^ ^ itu U-w^cal ^ OH . V V ( refuse financial assistance. The result of this will be that the Sultan will leave Muscat to its fate and will retire to Iihofar. He will have the revenue from the province which is considerable and in addition for three or four years the Hb, 8,000 a month which Petroleum donee Helens Limited are pay ing. Muscat and Oman will be left to any one who is strong ^ enough to hold them. There will be trouble in Oman and in the Batinah. The importance to us of Muscat and Ctaan stiategically will no doubt determine the policy which we will adopt. Hie / damagedamage to British Indian commeroial interest*^ and the •necessity for the protection of British Indian liTe® Er'T'oToper’ty must taken into coneideration* I feel that we shall have to interfere and at least rnaintain law and order on the coast and in the principal towns• The adoption of this policy will result in a very unsatisfactory state of affairs which will prove very troublesome and expensive# 15* The last alternative is to come to agreement with France arid the Sultan and place hiE in much the same position as the Sultan of Korocco. As long at he is in receipt of a regular income he will be more than happy in Dhofar* As long as he is the titular head there can be no question of a successor and dynastic rows will be avoided for the time being* Such money as may be necessary to carry on Government will be controlled by us* With careful management and super- vision I believe that the financial position can be much improved and that the presence of a squadron of the iloysl rtir Force in Muscat or «»atrah with a detachment of Indian Troops will be sufficient to maintain security* operations might and probably would have to oe undertaken In the Interior but these would be exclusively air operations* Political Gfii cers could do much towards a better understanding with the tribes* The strategic value of rusoat would be much increased and its commercial value would be greatly improved* 16* * I apologise for the length of this letter but I have only dealt with the subject very briefly and have not examinee! the alternative courses of action in any detail* I regret that distance makes consultation so difficult* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd* T.Hickinbothorn, ^aptuin, I»A*, Political Agent &amp; H*B*H* v s Consul, Muscat*Register No. Minute Paper.

He is pursuing a forward policy in the hinterland of Muscat, or to be juster perhaps, he is recovering by a liberal use of his newly-filled purse the influence which the Imam had usurped over the Sheikhs of the interior. Two powerful supporters of the Imam, Sheikh Isa bin Salih of the Sharqiyeh and Suleman bin Hamyar of Jabl Akhdar have been brought into close and friendly relations with the Sultan and the Imam has been finding that many minor Sheikhs are becoming irregular in their payment of Zakat. The Imam can no longer hope to compete financially v/ith the Sultan, and as a result is less and less able to compete politically. Prom the point of view of H.M.G. this peaceful penetration is not disadvantageous. It enables the Sultan to guarantee security to P.C.L.

The *advic«* here is not that which a Political Agent tenders in India under the Advice Clause of a state's sanadp as Metcalfe seemed to think* but the considered, opinion of His Majesty 's GovfciBbitnt after representations by the Political Resident and the Qorzrammt of India. Sven teen it would require a %eoial position mid extremely competent political officers for successful results to be obtained. (6) The Defence Subsidy.

Bird on the other hand considered that the Sultan’s foroes tfiould sur round then, and take them prisoner* This is of oo^rte complete Jy impractical, and there is no sense in chewing the fat with the Sultan In this way* If the men were unarmed they would wery likely be surrounded and handed over, but in the unlikely event of their landing an armed party, the local Omanis would melt away like trie morning miet* (5) Metcalfe wanted some control over food prices and pointed out that we supplied the State* Here of course he was on good ground, but he was unable to show that any profiteering had taken place, or that the Sultan had ever shown that he wae not prepared to deal with it himself* I do not anticipate any difficulty under this head* (6) Metcalfe mentioned that he had writ tan the x cobv enclosed, sultaii a'letter, and that the Sultan had refused to accept it and asked him to take it back* The Sultan acutely dislikes letters being placed on record which convey any impression of inferiority, or in any way suggest that the lolitioal Agent is aatitled to interfere in the State, because not merely is he aware than an /igenoy clerk has typed it, but he knows that his own employees will see it and that he will thereby lose face. Metcalfe should have known that in questions of this sort the Sultan frequently writes letters with hie oiaa hand to avoid his position being prejudiced* 1 will return to this subject later (7) Metcalfe then mentioned that certain taxes were likely to be increased, and that the increase would fall on the British subjects for whom he was responsible, and that he was afraid some of the money would be mis spent* I am afraid there must be a lot of British subjects in Indian states in India vhoee money is being misspent right now, but I doubt if the Government of India are shedding many tears over it* Ho British subjects are bound to live in ? Ukcat, and in any case taxation is far lower than in India and no one has complained* (8) He then went on to point out that the inieterS for External affairs and Internal ..ffairs were heavily in debt and that the internal administration was unreliable. I think these remark© might apply to any .jrab State in the liddle Saet, with the possible ex ception of the *udan and lolestine* (9) He mentioned that the uultun was cooperative, but that it was necessary occasionally to give one’s opinion / r' ,r.6, / • «5~ opinion in writinu taxi ttafct th« ..ultsn objectod to this.

Captain, X*A* Political Agent &amp; H.B.M* s Consul, Muscat*PRELIM IN ARY SURVEY Y SURVEY , &gt; The situation in 1937 was generally as followsi- The situation in 1937 was The Sultan was in Dhofar where he had been since October 12thj 1935 and, seei&amp;ed likely to remain for an in definite time. Saiyid Shahab, an uncle of the Sultan was nominally in charge of affairs in Muscat. He was a pleasant, ineffective, man not fond of making decisions. Rai Sahib Duli Chand was Director of Revenues. The finances of the State were fair. The budget was being balanced at least on paper, but there was nothing to spare to carry out sanitary and public health projects which were long overdue. The Batinah was quiet and the local Governors giving little or no trouble. The province of Dhofar was under the immediate control oi the Sultan. The coastal area between Muscat and Sur not more than usually unruly. In the interior the Imam vas at his headquarters at Nizwah and was in a strong politi cal position. He was supported by Isa bin Salih of the Sharqiyeh and Jabl Akhdar. These Shaikhs were a the Sultan and like the Imam had n Sultan's administration. They con Oman proper. They paid 'Zakat” to their major problems to him. He h death. Ordinary tribal troubles w Shaikhs themselves without referen not only had no say in affairs in * these men but he had no contact wi* was a forbidden land to him and hi Jabl Akhdar in the neighbourhood o: Bar&amp;imi oasis the tribal leaders w&lt; They owed no allegiance to the Imai subordinate to the Sultan had no p] and it is doubtful whether they wotattention to requests sent to them by him. The principal Shaikhs in this area were the leaders of the A1 Bu Shamis and the Naim tribe. They showed an inclination to take the advice of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi rather than that of the Sultan. lams* On 15th February 1937 the Sultan returned to Muscat after an absence of sixteen months. He entered into negotia tion with Petroleum Concessions Limited for the Muscat and Dhofar concession. Agreement was eventually reached on 24th June 1937. Towards the end of the same year the Sultan was visited by Shaikh Isa bin Salih the paramount Shaikh of the Sharqiyah. He remained in Muscat for six days and was the Sultan*s guest. The visit was an expensive one as far as His Highness was concerned and it was reported on good autho —-4 rity that Shaikh Isa was given a substantial present on leaving. Shaikh Isa had never been the Sultan*s guest before and had not visited Muscat for many years. Developments were interrupted by the Sultan*s World tour in the winter of 1937-38. He returned to Muscat on 13th July 1938 and since that date events have moved rapidly. Im portant and unimportant tribal leaders from the interior have visited him in Muscat and a list of these visitors is given as an annexure to this report. Some of these visitors deserve ai^ individual mention. Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah al Hamudah ie the on paramount Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali. He had its more than one V occasion proved himself &amp; nuisance to the Muscat Government. /• His tribal area lies inland from Sur and for years has been N forbidden ground to the Euler of Muscat and Oman. He accepted a handsome present and a monthly stipend from the Sultan and ^ j far as security is concerned the Sultan is prepared to accept responsibility for survey parties of Petroleum Concessions Limited entering the greater part of this Shaikh*s tribal territoryterritory. Shaikh Mohammad bin Baritk of the Bani Battash rules the area behind ^uryat am has not been on good terms with the Sultan and has not visited Muscat. He has now been in for a visit and departed a richer man. Shaikh Ahmad b in Mohammad the Shaikh of the Zara is doubly important in that in addition to being an influential man he is also the son in law of the Imam. ShaiMa Mohflmm ad bin Isa is the son of Shaikh Isa bin Salih. He was on his way to Zanzibar and while waiting in Muscat for a steamer steamer stayed with His Highness as his guest. The last and by no means the least important of the visitors are the paramount Shaikhs of the Naim and the A1 Bu Shamis who arrived here on the a 7th Mhrb of this month and affirmed their allegiance to the Sultan. His Highness in his capacity as their overlord arranged a truce between them for one year. They had been at faud for sometime past. His Highness received a messenger from Shaikh Sulemain bin Hamyar of Jabl Akhdar on the 18th of June and accepted a horse which has been sent to him as a gift by thec^'' Shaikh. In addition to the quite imposing list of the visitors there have been some significant appointments. The Sultan has X X. appointed Shaikh Suleman Baruni as his adviser on 'Internal c. at X. Affairs' and he is at present in Muscat. Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah T wno is the brother of the Imam has been appointed Wall of Boshar t ** and His Highness was pleased to honour his Wali by driving to n « - Boshar on 5th May 1939 and dining with him. The lat^Qadhi of Mi**. V 1 •f1^^ji Hastuq Shsdkh Nasr bin Rashid al Kharusi, who is a brother of the late Imam was appointed Qadhi of Suwaiq by the Sultan on 12th May 1939. This individual is a man of very strict religous views and is reported to command a considerable following among the 'Ulema' who are responsible for the election of the Imam. That the Sultan is not neglecting the religous leaders is clear and that he is in touch with other influential members of the 'Ulema' / The Sultan has elected to spend his summer in Muscat this year4 - this year and not go to Dhofar which is very dear to him# He has moved to the small village of Cantab situated within six miles of the capital f and visits his office at Muscat two or three times a week, travelling from Qantab by motor boat. Rai Sahib Duli Chand has been dismissed but his place as a favourite has been ta.en by the pro-Arab PalestinLai t _ School ?*laster Ismail bin Khalil Rassasi, who recently has been appointed tfali of Matrah. This individual does not see eye to eye with Shaikh Suleman Baruni who is a man of more intelli gence. The Imam has been finding his finances rather difficult to manage and it is known that some of the Shaikhs have ceased to be regular in their payment of l, Zakat w . He has been forced to sell some of his property to meet his commit ments. Recently he was reported on very good authority to have held a meeting at Nizwah to consider the situation. He was alarmed, at the number of his followers who were finding Muscat interesting. He intended issuing an order that Muscat was out of bound and that Shaikhs were forbidden to visit the Sultan. On the advice of Shaikh Isa bin Salih the order was not issued or if it was was cancelled. Shaikh Isa is said to have contended that the order would not be obeyed and an attempt to enforce it would only lead to bloodshed which was undesirable. The meeting was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS. The known facts only have been stated and it is because doubtful information has been excluded that the events from 1937 to the present day cannot be given as coherent story but must be set out as an appyfrently disconnected series of incidents# There are so many straws that there enough of them to show fairly clearly the direction of sfie events, .ihethar the wina will blow steadily whether it is an URCextaiQuncertain affair that may die^ away at any moment is like all atmospheric forcasts largely a matter of guessing# A record of events is a matter of fact but the deductions to bs irom them must necessarily be personal and merely an expression of views* From the events that I have recorded I draw the following conclusions- In 1937 the Sultan, who is not of a warlike disposition though a man of considerable personal courage, saw little chance of regaining control of the whole of Muscat and Oman by the only alternative methods to fighting and that was by buying the alle- a gience of the Shaikhs and so undermining the Imam's influence. His financial resources would not permit of any extra expenditure. Even if he had succeeded in regaining control without money for development the interior offered little but trouble, therefore he decided to leave affairs in Muscat in the hands of Rai Sahib Duli Chand who might be a man of doubtful honesty but was a eapa capable revenue official who produced sufficient money for the Sultan and the State's immediate requirements. He knew that the presence of our landing grounds along the coast would make it essential that peace be maintained from south of Kalba to Kishen, that if there was trouble in these areas he took no action the probabilities were that we would settle the matter for him. The most pleasant place in to live in his country, that was accessible to him, was Dhofar. Climatically it is pleasant and is green. The tribes were quiet and he liked them personally Very well,he would retire to Dhofar in much the same way as his father had retired to Japan. There without worries he would lead a quiet and pleasant life. The interest that commercial under takings evinced in the possibility of oil in Arabia after the success of the Bahrain field offered a means of obtaining more money. He returned to Muscat in February 1937 and the negotia tions were completed in June 1937 and the money was a fact. TheThe 1m ediate result of the possession of ample funds was the decision to make a world tour. The world cruise probably brought before the Sultan a true realisation of his position. He was a ruler in name and little else. The part he did rule, he ruled only because the British Government seemed to be prepared to maintain the status quo in Muscat for their own purposes and would probably help him to put down any rising against his au thority. whether or not His Majesty^ Government would have been prepared to aid him is a question that does not concern this appreciation. The tribes believe we would and so they still believe which is important. Being a young man, he is twentynine, he naturally wished to manage his own affairs. The*again and very important the money he had received would not last for ever and the yearly payments he was to receive from the Oil Company were limited somewhat abruptly. If he was to be financially secure the company must find oil and they could not do that without exploring the concession area. Unfortunately the most hopeful areas lay outside his control. In order to allow the company access to these areas he muslTeither come to some monetary arrangement with the Imam which was distasteful to him or else the tribal Shaikhs must be weaned from their allegiance to the Imam. The latter course he preferred. It would certainly be cheaper in the long run and if he was sucess- ful then he would be in fact as well as in name Sultan of Muscat and Oman. As soon as he returned to Muscat he started to make his plans. The tribal Shaikhs have been invited to Muscat and bribed. Some of the Imam's relatives have been induced to leave him. The ,, Jlema ,, are doubtful of their position and are in- , dining more and more to Muscat. This attack on those surround ing the Imam and on those on whom he depends for support has already resulted in a great increase in the Sultan's influence in the interior and a corresponding decrease in the Imam's power. The Imam being financially embarrassed has been unable to meetto meet the attack. The Sultan hopes that the Imam will be forced to abdicate and that his influence will be so great that he will be elected as the next Imam - thus once again combining Xmamate with the Sultanate. The attack will be maintained until the financial amunition fails or until the Imam has abdicated. Shpuld the ammunition fail before the attack has been successful the Sultan will retire to Dhofar and resume his old life. He may even ask for his country to be taken under the protection of the British Government like Zanzibar. That he has recovered much lost ground is certain and opinions regarding his influence must be revised. Should he be successful in his undertaking I % fear he may find that retaining his ^a more difficult task than he expects. He is young and with sage councillors may display the strength of character and soundness of judgment necessary for the task. Recently his choice of advisers has not been very happy.I find that Sheikh Isa has not been in since 1937 7 (winter) o During the last few months the following Sheikhs have paid visits to Muscat and been entertained by the Sultant- The Sheikhs of the Middabi. Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammad of the Yal Hibi. Sheikh .vhamis bin Said of the As San&amp;dal. Sheikh Hasr bin Ali of the Arazoah* Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Sheikh of the Bani Bu Ali. SheikhSuleman bin Sinan Sheikh of Yankal. Sheikh Ahmad bin Mohammad Sheikh of 2ahra,son-in- law of the Imam. Sheikh Mohammad bin Harith of the Bani Battash. Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah wall of Boshar* a brother of the Imam. Sheikh Mohammad bin Isa bin Salih of the Sharkiyah The Sheikh of Fujaira. The Sheikh of the Jabri. The Chief of the Siyabi. Sheikh Nasr bin Bashid al ^hurusi brother of the late Imam and ^adhi of Hustad arrived and left to o take up his appintment as Qadhi of Suwaiq. Sheikh Hasr bin Salim. Sheikh All bin Abdullah Sheikh of Jalaam. Sheikh Sagar bin Sultan of the Haim. Sheikh Mohammad bin Hahmah of the Al Bu Shamis. Sheikh Mohsin bin 2ahran,*&gt;heikh of Siyabi. it is a fairly representative list. Many of these: persons have not been to Muscat for years. The appointment of the last qadhi of Hustaq as qadhi of Suwaiq is interesting. in my opinion His Highness has extended his influence considerably during the last few months.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00021a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2994</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00021a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2994</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 20/34 'Muscat: Relations with Sultan of Muscat'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-13T22:19:26</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (46 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in very rough chronological order from the back to the front.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 48; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence, memoranda, and minutes relating to relations between the Sultan of Muscat and other powers, including the British.
