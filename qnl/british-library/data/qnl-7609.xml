(Chick 1910, see correction 1911, makes this a distinct tribe.)” AGHA JARI (2)— A subtribe of the Liravi Kuhgaltfs, inhabiting the country north-west of Behbehan. They are classed among the Zir-i-Kuh tribes. History .—Prior to the time of the late Isfandiar Khan, Ilkhani of the Bakhtiarls, the Agha Jari were a numerous and prosperous tribe, number ing some 2,000 families, under a Chief by name Fateh Agha, who had his headquarters at Julaki. Isfandiar Khan, however, picked a quarrel with this tribe and looted them completely, after which the tribe becamesplit up into small factions, each under a petty Chief. In this state they have remained to the present day, but although split up, still retain their predatory instincts. Ethnography .—The sub-divisions of the Agha Jari are as follows :— 1, Afshar. 2, Bagdali. 3, Tllaku. 4, Jameh-Buzurgl. 5, Jaghtai. 6, Daudl. 7, KaraBaghl. 8, Sha’ri. 9, Gashtll. 10, Lar Zab in. The following were the various Chiefs of the Agha Jari in 1910 :— (a) Muhammad Husain Khan, (b) Mulla Rah Khuda. (c) Mulla Vali Khan. (d) Mulla ’Ali Agha. (e) Husain Agha. C 394 GSB■'HP? i! AGH—AHIVT 2 (а) Muhammad Husain Khan, son of Fateh Agha, has a following of about 200 families, who inhabit the villages of Dudangeh and Kurlsieh, but is unable to muster more than 200 fighting men, of whom only ^ are armed with rifles. J 4 (б) Mulla Rah Khuda has a small following of 60 families, living at Lasbid and could muster 60 armed men all told, mounted and dismounted. (c) Mulla Vali Khan, son of Barat Agha, has a following of 100 families whose habitat is at Rudkhaneh-i-Kurmuz, capable of putting 100 armed men into the field. (d) Mulla Ali Agha has a small following of about 100 families, whose habitat is at Maur-i-Lasbld and can muster 100 armed men. This sub tribe still retains its predatory habits, but descends to petty thieving more than organized looting. (e) The last of the Agha Jari sub-divisions is under the leadership of Husain Agha, who lives at Kaleh-i-Tilagun, and consists of 100 families (150 fighting men, only 100 of whom possess rifles). The Jaghtal are a small tribe of some 150 families, subject to Mulla Vali Khan of the Agha Jari living in the vicinity of Behbehan, which they supply with dairy produce, viz., milk, curds (Lur : mast) and ghi. They are good fighting men, can muster 150, all well armed, under the leadership of Duh- rab Agha, who has his headquarters at Mangilas, at which place there is a Fort, in which he lives. There are two other forts in the possession of the Jaghtai, one inhabited by ’Ali Nijat, the other by Lurahisit. The Jaghtai claim to have come originally from Shiraz and to be descended from Jenghiz Khan. For resources of the tribe and further information see under Kuhealu (Ranking 1910.) AHMADI BAHMAT— A sub-division of the Kuhgalu tribe, classed as’one of the Chehar Banicheh and located among the Pusht-i-Kuh group. They occupy the moun tains adjoining the JanikI Garmslr, and the Janiki Sardsir, namely north west of Behbehan and east of Ramaz. The residence of their chief is Kaleh A’ali, near the source of one of the branches of the Jarrahi. They are the most notorious robbers, and as ignorant and barbarous as any tribe in these mountains. The shedding of blood is carried to a lamentable extent among them ; the life of a man is no more valued than that of a sheep. They are treacherous and deceitful ; with them no oath is binding ; and no traveller, unless protected in the strongest way, should venture to go amongst them. The Bahmal tribe was well and firmly ruled over by ’Ali Naki Khan and his successor Hussain Khan is also capable. It is sub-divided into two main divisions :— (а) Ahmadi. (б) Mahmudi (q.v.). The Ahmadi are further sub-divided as follows :— Waisi. Sa’adat-i-Mangana Zur. Qambari. Shuja’-ud-Dim. Shusini. ’Ali Mihri. S ?Baguli. Malsakhtf. Muhammad Musal. Yusufi ( see below). Mehdi. Mahmudi. ’Ala-ud-DIni {see below). Balyabi (Bu-ul-Abi ?) Biqini. Mulla Abbasl. ’Isavi. Ghaibi. The AhmadI Bahmai at present number some 2,500 families, though in former times they numbered as many as 6,000 families. These, however, owing to oppression and other internal causes, little by little dispersed and settled in the Bakhtiari country. At present they could put up an armed force of about 3,000 men into the field, together with 30 or 40 sowars. The Ahmadi Bahmai are on friendly terms with the Taiyibi Garmsir, the Agha Jari, and the Bakhtiari tribes. Country .—Boundaries of land inhabited by the Ahmadi Bahmai are Kaleh-i-Baba Khan (Bulfaris), Tashan, Kuh-i-Karun, Charusak, Chehar Darreh and Barani. Their summer quarters are Likak, Tashan and Lower Mumbi, and their winter quarters, Kuh-i-Safid, Kuh-i-Karun and Upper Mumbi. The following forts are in their territory:—Kaleh-i-Likak inhabited by ’Ali Naki Khan. Kaleh-i-Mumbi inhabited by Husain Khan. Kaleh-i- Baba Khan. The genealogy of the late ’All Naki Khan Bahmai, is as follows :—’Ali Naki Khan, son of Muhammad Husain Khan, son of Khalil Khan, son of Mulla ’Ali Shir, son of Mulla Abdul Khalil, and then 2 or 3 more generations to Agha ’Ali, Behdarvand, Bakhtiari. ’Ali Naki Khan had 8 brothers, viz .:— 1. Husain Khan. 5. Muhammad ’All Khan. 2. Muhammad Shafi Khan. 6 Jalll Khan. 3. Husain Qull Khan. 7. ’AH Muhammad Khan. 4. Muhammad Taki Khan, Sarhang. 8. Kubad Khan. The first two of whom assisted him in the administration of the tribe, and Husain Khan, who is a man of strong character and feared by the tribe, succeeded as chief in 1911. Muhammad Shafi Khan is clever, but unfortu nately a heavy opium-smoker ; he lives at Likak. ’All Naki Khan, the eldest of the brothers, had a wife, the daughter of ’Ali Murad Khan, Taiyibi (Garmsiri), by whom he had one son, Lutf ’Ali Khan (about 7 years old in 1909) and two daughters. The following properties, viz .:—Tashan {q.v.) Kai Kaus'^.v.) Dudangeh {q.v.) Kurdistan {q.v.) belong to the Bakhtiari Khans, and were rented by ’Ali Naki Khan. • Husain Khan Bahmai, has four wives, by whom he has 3 sons (all small &gt; 1910) and 2 daughters. Has his headquarters at (Upper) Mumbi (4,500'), in the vicinity of which place are collected some 1,500 families of Bahmais an d actually round the fort in which he lives, 40 families of ’Amalajat. The Upper Mumbi valley contains 500 khish of unirrigated land and one water mill situated at a place called Chiri.AHR—ARA 4 Communimfwns.—From Bahmai territory the main route to Ramflz goes via Jaizun and Bulfaris, that to Behbehan goes via Kai Kaus and that to the Bakhtiari country goes via Dalun. The only means of communication between Likak and Mumbi is eithei via the Tang-i-Laghar and the Tang-i-Daula, or the Tang-i-Maghar and the Tang-i-Daula—both tracks are extremely difficult and impassable to any thing but the very lightest loaded animals, and, even then, loads have to be man-handled twice en route. Ala-ud-Dini .—The ’Ala-ud-Dini are technically of the same stock as the Bahmai, but consider themselves separate from them. Formerly they were numerous, and loyal supporters of the Bahmai, but, latterly, they have be come scattered and lost sight of. At present (1910) they number some 1,000 families, owing allegiance to ’AH Naki Khan, Bahmai, to whom they pay taxes as over-lord. They have the reputation of being good fighters, and can turn out 1,000 armed men on the necessity arising. Their summer quarters are Rud-i-Talkh, and their winter quarters Kuh-i- Kariin. The Ala-ud-Dini are on friendly terms with the Taiyibi (Garmsiri) and the Bakhtiaris, and are subservient to the Bahmais (Ahmadi). The main routes from the country inhabited by the ’Ala-ud- Dini to Behbehan go via Tashan, and to Ramuz via Likak. . ^ asufi. The Yusufi are_ a sub-tribe of the Ahmadi Bahmai, under the immediate leadership of Agha Mustafa Khan, consisting of 300 families, whose habitat is in the Bahmai country—capable of turning out 200 armed men. The.r summer quarters are in Maur-i-Bid, and their winter quarters in in Upper Mumbi. The main route to Behbehan from Yusufi country passes through the Tang-i-Sarvak, while that to Ramuz passes Bulfaris. For further information re resources, taxation, etc., of the Ahmadi Bah mai see under Kuhgalu. (Ranking, 1910.) AHR AM— (River), See under “ Tangistan ARABISTAN (Northern)— After the first paragraph add the following :— History. —(Incuding Southern Arabistan). During 1909 and following years Arabistan was almost the only province where tranquillity reigned, and this was due to the firmness and ability of Shaikh Sir Khaza 1 Khan. Thanks to his friendly attitude towards British enterprise, our trade flourished considerably, as is indicated by the fact that 78 British subjects, and 614 British Indians were reported to be in the province in 1911. A severe epidemic of plague, however, which visited Muhammareh, Basrah, and Ahwaz in 1911, discounted the results of two good harvests and even attacked the European colony of Ahwaz. In 1912, there was some trouble regarding Shushtar between the Shaikh of Muhammareh and the Bakhtiaris, and the former occupied the town with his Arabs in April 1911; but withdrew on a neutral governor being appointed from Tehran*ARA 5 ’ARABISTAN.—Page 66, after line 8 and above the previously issued correction insert .— The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited (capital £2,000,000), the suc cessors of Messrs.

Totalling 2,000 families, capable of putting 2,000 armed foot-men into the field. In the reign of Nadir Shah the Bavi were transplanted by the order of that potentate of Khorasan, together with their Chief, Hashim Khan. After the death of Hashim Khan, his son found means to return with his followers to their former habitat. The land inhabited by the Bavi is bounded by Mamassani, Buir Ahmadi, Liravi, and the Behbehan district. The Bavi are a sedentary population living in Basht, whose chief occupation is growing tobacco which sells at 10 tumans per maund.

(Ranking, 1910), BEHBEHAN (Town) delete present entry and substitute the following :— BEHBEHAN Town—Lat. 30° 33' N. Long. 50° 28' E. Elev. 1,300*; A town in Ears, and the capital of the administrative division of the same name. It is situated 128 miles west-north-west of Shiraz and 43 miles north-BEH—BEH 9 north-east of Bandar Dilam, in an extensive plain watered by the Kurdistan or Marun river, from the banks of which it lies 3 miles south. History. Local tradition traces the name of the town to the settlers who came there after the destruction of Arijan. These people came and camped there in Ilmt fashion in black goats-hair tents, called by them “ Bohuns”, for which they gradually substituted mud houses which they said were “ Behlar-az-bohun ” (Lur : better than tents). This appellation gradually by long usage became crystalised, through various stages, into its present form Behbehan. Behbehan is a town of extremely ancient and probably of Sassanian origin, though it is difficult to say definitely to whom it owes its founda tion. It gained notoriety only after the destruction of Arijan and Kubad, which latter name, it may be of interest to note, was the name given to the 5th Kureh or district at present represented by the Behbehan district, into which, in former times, Ears was divided, viz.: —Istakhr, Darabjird, Shahpur. Ardashir and Kubad. We may say, however, with a due amount of cer tainty, that it existed prior to the 14th century, from the fact that Sharif- ud-DIn ’All Yazdi mentions that Taimiir camped at Behbehan when en route from Tester (Shnshtar) to Kaleh Safid. In more recent times, during the Governorship of Mirza Kumu (circ. 1870), owing to his refusal to pay the taxes of Behbehan, the then Governor of Ears sent an expedition against Behbehan under the command of Mansur Khan, who attacked the town and put its inhabitants to the sword. Miraz Kumu himself, however, escaped and took refuge with the Ka’ab Arabs in the vicinity of Eallahieh. The latter are descendants of the Bani Ka’ab Arabs who migrated from the Hejaz. In later years, the Behbehan Governorship has been, off and on, in the hands of the Bakhtiari Chiefs, the last occasion being during the winter of 1909-10, when Bias Khan, Bakhtiari, Sarum-ul-Mulk, son of Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zafar, and Fath’AlI Khan, Bakhtiari, Salar-i-Muyid, son of Lutf ’Ali Khan, Amir-i-Mufakham, held the Governorship for a few months, the former on behalf of the Ilkhani, and the latter on behalf of the Haji Ilkhani family of the Bakhtiaris. On the departure of the Bakhtiari Gov ernors in the spring of 1910, Mirza ’Ali Riza, Bahadur-i-Divan, was appoint ed Deputy Governor of Behbehiin, which post he held almost continuously till September 1912, when Amir-i-Mujahid, Bakhtiari was appointed. Description. The town is some 34 miles in circumference, and is surrounded by a mud wall flanked with circular towers and bastions. The south-east corner is occupied by a castle called Kaleh Naranj. It is a place of no great strength, but has thick and lofty mud walls surrounded by a ditch. Its interior is small and confined, and not capable of con taining a number of troops. It is defended by 5 or 6 rusty cannons and might successfully resist the attack of undisciplined troops. None of these defences are mentioned by Gabriel, 1905. There are no preten- C. 394 G.8.B.BEH—BEH 10 tious houses; the town is mostly in ruins and wears a dilapidated and poverty-stricken appearance. The streets are filthy with heaps of offal lying about, and there is no bazar worthy of the name. The Gov ernor, in 1903, had a beautiful garden. Population. The actual town of Behbehan is estimated to contain 4,000 houses and to have a total population of 20,000 souls, of whom 2,000 would be armed men. Wilson in 1912 estimated the population at only 6,000 to 8,000. In the town there are two parties, the Behbehanls and the Qanavatis, in the proportion of j of the former to § of the latter ; the town being divided into two mahalehs corresponding to these parties. The Qanavat tribe origin ally came from Kufah in Turkey, and the head of the mahaleh in 1910 was Mirza Ahmad, Shaikh-ul-Islam. The Behbehams are neither Persians nor Arabs, but a kind of mixture of the two. The chief man among the' Beh- behanis in 1903 was Muhammad Mu’in-ul Islam, who was formerly examiner in Persian and Arabic at Bombay for 10 years. He had a cousin called Saiyid Muntazir who had a trade connection with Bombay, and was said to be friendly to the English. In 1910 the head of the Behbehanl mahaleh was Mirza ’Ali Riza. In 1910 there was a bitter feud between these two mahalehs, causing con stant fighting and bloodshed. Resources. Trade. —Behbehan is an important town, being a concentrating and distributing centre for the caravan trade of the surrounding district. Owing to the lack of a proper bazar supplies of grain are, as a rule, scanty in the town. The Behbehan plain provides grazing for some 3,000 sheep and cattle, and except in years of drought, wheat is obtainable in the neighbourhood in large quantities, there are about 30,000 acres of irrigated and unirrigated land near the town. Wheat is the princi pal article of export. Bhusd also is obtainable in practically unlimited quantities. • Water .—The water supply under present conditions is meagre and bad, being supplied by a small drain which also forms the favourite washing-place of the population. Drinking water is stored in db-ambars, and is brought from a distance of 6 miles. There are three tanks here measuring 50' x 20' x 6' of covered masonry. Under a more energetic regime the town might be well supplied by qandts from the Marun river, where, also any force up to a division could obtain water. Transport. —Owing to the extensive caravan traffic, of which Behbehan is the centre, transport is generally available ; 2,500 good mules could probably be collected without much difficulty. Donkeys and cows 10,000, horses 500, sheep 8,000. There are 300 to 400 mules of all descriptions working on the Bandar Dilam road from here, and mules are bred in the provinceoi. ^ Mfc “14 BEH—BEH There is practically no traffic with Shiraz owing to the unsafeness of the road. Large and well-armed caravans are made up when necessary.— (Jones — Layard — Montieth — Stocqueler — Wells — Curzon. —1889 Hopkins, 1903— Gabrielt 1905—CTucA;, YnO—Ranking, 1910.) BEHBEHAN Province— A province geographically belonging to Ears, but having an administra tion and a governor of its own. For History see under Behbehan (Town). Geography. It is bounded on the north by the mountains which separate Traq-i- ’ ’Ajaml from the southern provinces of Persia ; east by Shulistan ; south by the Persian Gulf; west by Arabistan. The whole district is watered by numerous streams, the principal being the Shamsi, ’Arab, Khanabad, Marun and Rudkhaneh-i-Khairabad which it will be noted is the same as the Ab-i-Shirin, and corresponds with the Hindian River, which is the Arosis of Nearchus. The province includes the plain of Behbehan, situated about 7 miles from the northern mountains, and 18 miles from the Zaidan hills. It is from 21 to 25 miles in length. The soil, particularly on this plain, is a rich, alluvial deposit, which is very fertile. . . The climate is so mild, that in January the meadows m the vicinity of the town are covered with narcissus, appearing spread out like a white sheet several miles in circumference, and diffusing the most delicious fragrance. Population. For population of the town, see under Behbehan (To\\n). The following list shews the villages in Behbehan, their owners and the number of houses in each.

The inhabitants of the province are mostly of the Kuhgahi and Mama- sani tribes (q.v.) There is also an admixture of other tribes, immigrants from other districts and unclassified people, a mixture of Persian and Arab blood, who are generally known collectively as Behbehams. The following nine tribes are directly dependent on Behbehan :— (a) Bu Wall (=AbG 'Ali). [d) Buir Ahmadi (Garmsiri. (g) Jam-i-BuzurgI, (b) Khwaja Almas. (c) Kushdas. (h) Kashdil. (r) Shaikh-i-Mamu Shaikh (/) Baghdili.

The soil, particularly in the plain, is a rich alluvial deposit, yielding in the neighbourhood of the town a return of twenty-four fold of corn. In 1910 9,000 tons of wheat were grown, of which about 400 tons were surplus to local requirements. Near the Gulf, cotton and rice are the staple pro ductions. Among the fruit-trees are the lemon, orange, pomegranate, and plum ; of these the last takes precedence. Wild cabbage is the ordinary weed of the plain. The districts of Zaidan and Behbehan (near the town) could each of them support about a brigade in addition to their own populatiom For Administration, Communications and further information see Beh behan (Town) and Kiihgalu (coun'ry).

This district forms part of Dashtistan, and is part of the province of bars. It is bounded on the north by the river Rudhilleh from Haft Jush, where it meets Angal territory, to Dur'dgah, and thence by the Daliki or Shur River to some few miles past Buneh Mfrza. The b nmdary with Daliki is about 3 miles past Qara r l Khan, at a sulphur stream crossing the caravan road, and this boundary line then mounts to the summit of the hills. East, the boundary is along the summit of the Giseh Khan range past Kuh-i-Bagh-i-Taj. South, the boundary crosses the entrance to the Haft Mulla ravine, south of Namzak and Jamileh : between Sarkurreh and Sami and Gulangun in Tang;stan : then north of Bulfarlz and Gandumriz in langistan : north of Ab-i-Tavd in Chahkutah and south of Tsavand. West, the boundary is north-east from Tsawand, Nokal being in Angali and Jarrafi in Borazjun, to Haft Jush. Resources .—The district is entirely agricultural, a quantity of tobacco being produced besides grain. Adminis'ra'ion .—The mdlidt of Borazjun is 5,300 tumlns : the revenue of the Khan is said to be some 16,000 tunvlns by taxation of land under cultivation, and 20,000 turn ns, from rahdlri, alafl and the taxation of caravans, besides sale of monopolies of gum, etc. Ziarat used many years ago to be a separate entity in the hands of the Begs ”, so called ; but one of the family of the Khan of Borazjun now resides there. The following villages are in Borazjun district:— Borazjun. Khushmakun. Jarraff. Bandaruz. Giz-i-Bid, Shaifabad. Sar Kurreh. Deh-i-Nao. Kullul. Dar-i-Chatu. Bagh Hissar (along caravan Kharagah. route). Qaraiil Khaneh. 'Isavand (along caravan route). Chah-i-Khani (near cara- Ziarat. van route). Chah-i-’Arabi. Banar. Khushab (along caravan Jaim route). (In the Giseh Khan mountains) Ma’adabad. Burgabx. Khurmi. LardeK Kakun. Nakhi. Bunneh. Rahdar (along caravan route). Jamileh. Bagh-i-Chanar. Communications .—There are paths, practicable for lightly laden animals, up the Gis- h Khan range (i) by Lardeh, (ii) by Khurmi to the foot of the Kuh-i- Bagh Taj, whence the track is too difficult for animals. The Bagh-i-Taj crest is known by several names : from east to west Kamar-i-Zardak, Kamar-i-SKsinahu, Kamar-i-Dubareh, Kamar-i-Bardisar. The two last paths to the top of the crest are Rah-i-Kardak, and Rah or Puk-i-Barlki.— {Chick, 1912).BOR—BOR 18 BORAZJON (Town)- After the first paragraph add the following:— History. —The ruling family of the Khans are descended from a certain Mulla Muhammad, who came from the district of Kam Firuz, became a servant of the then dynasty, married the Khan’s daughter, and became chief in Borazjun. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh some years ago took over the gorvenment from his aged father. He and his father have acquired great wealth from black mail on the caravans passing through Borazjun, especially from monopolies of the sale of grain to animals. He had to take to the Giseh Khan moun tains when Ijlal-ud-Dauleh, the Wazir of Fars, attacked the chief of Dash- tistan, but returned later. He is married to a daughter of Isma’il Khan of Shabankareh, but the bitterest blood-feud reigns between him and this Khan on account of the district of Zira, which formerly was farmed by one of the Khans of Borazjun, but has for 15 years been let by Nizam-us-Sultaneh to the Khan of Shabankareh. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh has repeatedly tried to have his father-in-law evicted and himself given the lease. Constant bloodshed goes on between Shabankareh, Zira and Borazjun on these accounts, and raids are common. A further cause of hostility was his seizure and imprison ment, in the autumn of 1911, of his cousin Mlrza ’All Khan and the latter’s sons on a charge of conspiracy : Miiza ’All Khan’s sister being wife of Isma'Il Khan of Shabankareh. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh has been noted for his oppression of caravans ; and for his hostility to the British in 1909 and again in 1911, when he was actively stirring up agitation both before and after the passage of the Central India Horse. Outwardly fair spoken, he is a difficult man with whom to deal: he is the most noted buyer of, and dealer in, smuggled arms and am munition among the headmen of the Bushire littoral and hinterland. In 1912 he maintained about 500 tufangchis or ‘ road guards.’ (Chick 1912.)19 BUI—BUI BUIE AHMADl —For present entry substitute the following : — The Bulr Ahmadl belong to the Chehar Banicheh group of the Kfihgalfl and are classed as Pusht-i-Kuh. History .—Tribal tradition says that they are descended from Malik-ut- Tujjar, Isfahan!. One of their best known and most powerful chiefs was Karim Khan, who died in 1907. Since then the tribe has been split up, each faction following a different leader, with the inevitable result that the various factions are constantly at war with each other. In the autumn of 1909 the tribe was split up as follows part with Shukr- ullah Khan, part with the lineal descendants of Karim Khan, part with Qaid Muhammad ’AH, and the remainder with Mulla Kubad. Of these, Shukr- ullah Khan’s following is the largest; but the actual strength of the various factions is constantly changing as one p tty chief changes his allegiance from one to the other. With regard to external relations, they we e friendly with the Dushman Ziarl and Bavl, but enemies with the Taiyibl. In November 1909 the tribe carried out a carefully planned raid on the Russian Consul General’s caravan, in conjunction with the KashkutI under Muhammad ’All Khan. During 1911 and 1912, when the Bushire-Shlraz-Isfahan route was a con stant scene of robberies, it was the Bulr Ahmadi who were responsible for most robberies near the Urchini pass, and they used to penetrate even as far as the Isfahan-Yazd road. They acquired so much power in this district that the Governor of Abadeh actually appointed them guardians of part of this road at end of 1912. In December 1912 Bulr Ahmadls were suspected of co-operating with the Mamasanis and Kashkutls in the attack which resulted in Captain Eckford’s death near Khan-i-Zinian. Courtry .—The boundaries of land inhabited by them are Ludab, Sar Rud, Rudkhaneh-i-Sa’adat, Sa’adat-i-Shaikh Abil.* Their winter quarters are Sunkarabad, Kalat, Deh Dasht, and Suk-i- Changalvar, and their summer quarters Chinar, Sar Rud. Lands along the lower slopes of the Kuh-i-Dima (Dinar ?). They own the following fortsKaleh-i-Chanar, inhabited by Qaid Muham mad ’AH ; Kaleh-i-SisakhtI inhabited by Mulla Kubad ; Kaleh-i-Sar Rud, inhabited by Shukr-ullah Khan; Kaleh-i-Tal-i-Khusru inhabited by Ghulam Husain Khan ; Kaleh-i-Kalayar, inhabited by Muhammad Khan ; Kaleh-i- Fashiun, inhabited by a Saiyid Dal, Kaleh-i-Azu, inhabited by Azlzullah Khan ; Kaleh-i-Dil, inhabited by Nasrullah Khan. E hnogra. hy .—As a tribe, they own much land and, for Iliat, wealthy. The following table shews the sub-divisions (Lur: Task) into which Bulr Ahmadl are split up :— Ta Murad! (Lur : Ta or Tata, a brother) Kurrai. Afghai. Kagavai. Sisakhti. Ta Ahmadi. Juzari. Shaikh-i-Mamu, Dasht-i-Mauri. Sar Chuti. Narrai. Sardaki. Badluni. Sar Kuhaki. Shaikh-i-Abil, Tarmaji. Aulad-i-Mirza f Ali. Saiyid -i-Baba Muhammadi, ’Amalajat. The Bulr Ahmadi in all, number 4,500 families (22,000 souls). are theBUI—BUI 20 Trade. —The chief trade of the Bhlr Ahmadi is with Ardakan and, to a small extent, with Behbehan, from which latter place they get most of their arms and ammunition, though a small amount is also obtained from Ardakan. Most of the fruit which supplies the Behbehan market is grown in their territories. Mili'ary .—The Buir Ahmadi are capable of putting about 600 horsemen and 1,000 footmen into the field. They are brave and warlike, and make good fighting men. It is for the footmen, however, that they are best known, being noted for their mobility, and credited with the power of marching 80 miles a day. They are also noted for the audacity of their raids; their principal raiding grounds being near Khan-i-Zinian, and near Shulgistan. Chick says, ' They live in small fortresses in the mountains east of Beh behan, where they have supplies of provisions and water. The passes to their strongholds are inaccessible, and it would cost the Governor of Shiraa a very considerable sum to capture even a few of them. Divided into many hostile factions, some of which have, (1910), allied themselves with the Bakhtlari. In the plains it is said that one Qashqai tufangchl is worth 5 Bakhtiaris.” Chick also gives their numbers as 7,000 rifle men; but it is hardly possible that so many could be collected together. Communications .—The main roads leading from the Bflir Ahmadi territo ries are to Behbehan via Tang-i-Tikau; to Ram Hormtia, via Linda and Likak ; and to Ardakan through their own country.

Geography and Climate. A torpedo-shaped promontory lying parallel to the coast of the Persian district of Tangistan at a distance of 4 or 5 miles ; the intervening space is occupied by a grass and reed grown swamp or mashileh, across which runs a caravan route to the mainland. Extent. —The peninsula measures exactly 12 miles from its north-west tip, on which stands Bushire town, to Ras Halileh at the opposite end. The maximum breadth at about midway is about 3| miles. The peninsula is bounded by the sea on north, west and south ; on the east it is bounded by the mashileh. Physical features and vegetation. —The site of Bushire town is rocky and slightly elevated above the sea, but immediately south of it a strip of very low ground runs across the peninsula from coast to coast; beyond this low strip the ground begins to rise again, and the remainder of the peninsula is a sort of turtle back, attaining a maximum elevation of 150 feet in the centre at Imamzadeh village. There is a stretch of low cliff along the coast at the south-west corner of Bushire town and again in the neighbourhood of Rishahr. The low parts of the peninsula are sandy, the higher of a firm, arable soil. Here and there a little grass is to be found. An occasional her and tamarisk are the only natural growing trees ; but the babul and cypress are found ; also a tree with yellow flowers. Climate. —The hottest month in Bushire is August and the coldest months are January and February ; in summer the thermometer has been known to rise to IIS'S degrees F. The worst period is between the 20th of July and the 15th of September, when the temperature seldom rises above ICO, but the difference between the wet and the dry bulb readings is sometimes only 2 degrees. The average monthly rainfall for the five years ending 31st December 1906 was as follows :— January .. .. 1-23 at average 6 days per month. February .. .. . . 0 73 , r „ 5 „ „ „ March .. 0'61 „ „ 5 „ „ „ April .. .. .. 0'45 „ „ 3 „ „ „ May, June, July, August September and October. Nil. November .. ». D72 at average 4 days per month. December .. .. 2'58 „ „ 5 „ „ „ During 1909-1912 the average annual rainfall was about 15 inches. It will be seen from the above that most of the rainfall takes place in November, December, January and February, which may be said to consti tute the rainy season. These four months are intermittently stormy and cold on shore, the sea being rough. It seldom actually freezes, but the ther mometer occasionally falls almost to freezing point. Fires are almost a necessity in December, January and February and welcome after sundown C394GSBBUS—BUS 22 until the end of March. In March and April the rainfall is usually in the form of brief showers, the sky remaining otherwise clear. The heat on the high parts of the peninsula is less oppressive than in the town. The best seasons for moverr ents of troops through Bf.shire are (1) from 15th March to 30th April; (2) from 1st October to 30th November. From May 1st till the beginning of October the heat for the first 60 miles from the •coast is excessive, while from December till February the cold on the plateau is intense. Prevailing winds. —The prevailing winds are the Shamdl or north-west, and Kaus, which blows from the south-east. The former prevails at sea for nearly nine months of the year, and blows very cold and boisterous in the winter months, a Shamed or Nor’-wester ” lasting usually three days. The same wind blows almost incessantly during June and July, and though then less violent, relieves the temperature near the coast. At this season it is called locally the “ 40 days’ winds.” Health. —The sanitary condition of Bushire is bad, for the soil is riddled with cess-pools which are seldom cleaned out ; yet the place is riot unhealthy. Malarial fever is the most prevalent disease amongst the native population. Ophthalmia and other eye diseases are rife, caused by flies, dust, glare, and the insanitary habits of the people. Plague sometimes visits the place during the early summer. In 1911 there were 118 cases and 97 deaths between the end of April and beginning of July. Population. The inhabitants of the peninsula, exclusive of Bushire town, number about 8,500 souls and belong to mixed tribes. For further particulars see under Buskire Town. Resources. For Trade see under Bushire town. __The water of the'town is bad. Almost every house has a well, but the liquid which it yields is bitter ; about 10 per cent, of the houses are provided with reservoirs. The better class obtain their drinking water from Bahmani, Andar Bandar, Dahmiru and Bujikdan or Gunjashkdan, places in the Peninsula at a considerable distance from the town ; but even this water is slightly brackish and cannot be drunk with impunity by people who are not accustomed to it. The present European population, usually, either distil the local water or obtain water from ships. Wells are very nu merous all over the Peninsula, but the following are among the most im portant. l t 1 The wells called “ Bahmani ” just outside the Malik s house at Rishahr; these run almost dry in the hot weather. These are one of the chief sources of drinking water for men. 2. The Andar Bandar ( £ ‘ Oonder Boonder ”) wells (under the telegraph line and about 21 miles east of Malik’s house). These are said to be inex haustible, and are used freely by the inhabitants, who carry away waterBUS—BUS 23 on donkeys ; There are 6 wells, and the water is about 15 feet below the surface, and is very deep. 3. Wells at “ Tangak ” the property of Katkkudd Zahir ’Ali, near the Mashileh, about If miles east of Sabzabad Residency, and If miles south-east of “ Oonder Boonder.” These wells are also said to be inexhaustible and not so brackish as the others. 4. Shallow wells near the beach at Bandar Halileh, which are fairly sweet, and always contain water. There appears to be no shortage of water for animals. The horses and mules of the 39th Central India Horse at the Malik’s house in 1911-13 were watered from a well just outside the south wall of the Malik’s house, which contains 20 feet of water, and apparently never diminishes. While the British Indian detachment of about 300 men was at Bushire (1911-13) arrangements were made by the provision of forty-one 400-gallon tanks to provide for a possible failure of the local supply of water. It was inten ded that water should be sent up from Karachi by British India steamers, trans ferred in Bushire harbour to 400-gallon tanks on lighters, which would be taken to Rishahr, where the water would be pumped into other tanks on shore and conveyed thence by donkeys daily to tanks in the Malik’s house. There was, however, no necessity found for putting this arrangements into opera tion, as the troops, including British Officers, drank the water from the Malik’s house wells, and from the Andar Bandar wells. Agriculture—k large proportion of the peninsula consists of arable land, which in part is cultivated by means of wells and in part by rainfall. The ordinary crops are wheat and barley, sown about December and reaped after 4 months (April-May). In places there are date groves, but not of thriving appearance. There are quantities of grapes and many other fruits grown. Vegetables of all sorts are grown except potatoes. The amount of arable land under cultivation on the peninsula is about 200 gan, each gan producing 5 to 6 cwt, say 60 tons, altogether, in the pro portion of about 5 to 2 wheat and barley. Much wheat and barley comes to Bushire from the surrounding district for export, and it is estimated that amounts varying from 150 maunds to 500 maunds of wheat, and from 100 to 350 maunds of barley, depending on the time of year, would be purchasable at any particular moment. If the crops are good, there would be between 800 and 1,000 tons of corn available. In 1910-11 the export of grain through Bushire was 2,571 tons; but in 1911-12 as much as 14,738 tons was exported, over § oi which went to the United Kingdom and | to Germany. In 1856 a force of 4,000-5,000 with 1,000 horses lived on the country for two or three months. A demand for rations for 400 Indians could probably be met at any time, and in 1911, at a fortnight's notice the naval contractor, Mr. Gulzad, produced about 80 maunds of flour. For a force of any thing over one battalion it would be necessary to ship a month’s supply from India, and give a month’s warning for supplies in Bushire. There are no mills in Bushire, excepting small hand mills, and some mills worked by animals. v Supplies (for cereals see above).—Meat, rice, vegetables, ghi, dates and fish are procurable in the bazaars. Sheep and goats are plentiful on theBUS-BUS 24 peninsula ; but oxen are scarce and small. Fish are caught in large quan tities (sometimes about 5 tons in a day), and are more plentiful in winter than in summer. Milk is not drunk and is difficult to obtain. Bread and soda water are not procurable. Fuel ,—Firewood is usually cut in October and November, in the hills east of Borazjun, and collected for consumption in Bushire and the neighbouring villages. This supply lasts from October to February or March ; but t 1 en it ceases, and Bushire becomes dependent upon supplies brought up the coast by boat from Kangan, Tahiri, etc., etc. From April to September, there fore, special arrangements are necessary for collecting large supplies of fuel. Charcoal is in general use ; but it is not stored. There are no coal depots, except private ones for the Royal Navy, the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Arab S. S. Company; nor are there any large oil depots. Fodder .—There is scarcely any land left for grazing in Bushire, but hay and fodder are brought in as required from the neighbouring districts, where the inhabitants store it. In a rainless season there may be no fodder, but in a good one 500 animals could be fed for a month. Mules go out to Ahmadi both for grazing and water. The local fodder is chopped straw to which animals take some time to get accustomed. Transport. The only forms of transport are mules, camels and donkeys. Mules .—Chiefly mule transport must be relied on for transport up the Post Road. The number available varies according to the time of year, the amount of traffic on the Shiraz Road, and the state of public feeling. Eight hundred mules arrived in Bushire on the “ Nau Ruz ” about 21st March (1912): 500 mules arrive fairly frequently. Mules working on the Bushire-Shiraz Post Road in normal times are said to be between 2,000 to 3,000 at least. There were 1,500 on the road when the Central India Horse arrived, in November 1911, and there were very unfavourable conditions then prevail ing. Mules in any numbers would be best procured by the assistance of the civil authorities, through a broker, who sends out along the road and en gages them en rou'e to Bushire. It would take probably two to three days under ordinary circumstances to procure 500 mules. The amount of transport ordinarily present at or near Bushire may be estimated at 250 to 300 mules when the Shif route is closed, but when it is open there are none. The Persian mules are strong sturdy animals, carrying an average weight of 320 lbs.; if engaged “ by weight ” they carry up to 400 lbs. Their loads should be placed high for the Shiraz Road. The owners do not require much persuas on if engaged through the usual channels, and if good hire is given ; they might, however, fear risks. The muleteers themselves arrange for food for their mules. | Camels .—Camels come in frequently in small numbers, 40-50 from the surrounding neighbourhood up to 30 miles or so. They do not go up the Post Road to Shiraz. They can be obtained at a few days’ notice up to about 400. Rudhilleh owns 400, and the numbers estimated asBUS—BUS 25 available from Dashti and Tangistan are considerably higher. A camel carries only 320 lbs. Donkeys. Donkeys are easily obtained for local work in Bushire, they carry 160 lbs., they do not work on the Shiraz Post Road, but are said to work on the Firuzabad road. Horses .—Horses suitable as chargers are difficult to obtain, and no re mounts are available. Military. ^ Defences .—The town of Bushire on the land side has a wall 30' high and 5 to 6 thick, pierced for musketry ; otherwise there are no defences except a deserted redan at Rishahr. The peninsula can be defended from the interior, by occupying a ridge which rises 100 feet above the road level, on the western side of the Mashlleh. There are no defences against a landing, and the only fort on the peninsula, that at Rishahr, is in disrepair. Infantry .—Nominally the Governor of Bushire has at his disposal a force of one battalion of regular infantry and 50 artillery men. In reality, in 1912, owing to want of money he had not a man upon whom he -could call. In May 1911, 300 sarbazes arrived from Shiraz to replace the force which had deserted, owing to non-receipt of pay, the previous August. These took bast, demanding pay, at different times during 1911 and 1912 at the British Residency, and at the Turkish Consulate. The Infantry is armed with the Werndl rifle, 310 of which are in use and 560 in store. There were also 280 Werndl rifles in the Customs in 1911, with 17,000 cartridges. In addition there were 2,000 rounds in issue and 13,000 in store. Artillery. —The artillery at Bushire consists of 36 gunners with 4 small breecli-loading guns, 14 muzzle-loading guns of obsolete pattern (some unmounted), 2 breech-loading guns, mounted on carriages and 2 howitzers. These last four are at the Governor’s palace of Chehar Burj, which faces on to the Khiir Sultan!; but they are of little value, as in 1912 they were rusty. There is a certain amount of ammunition for these, including 200 shells for the breech-loading guns. There are 15 semi-irregular sowars. The Governor’s power at sea is represented by the ' Persepolis ”, a gun-boat of 600 tons and 450 horse power, having an extreme speed of 6 knots, and carrying 6 guns and 24 Snider rifles. It is usually unfit to put to sea. British Consular Guard. —The detachment of Indian Infantry at Bushire, 1 Indian officer and 58 men, is divided between Bushire town, Sabzabad and Rishahr. There are also 9 Indian Cavalry. The extra troops landed in 1911 and 1912 (about 300 men) were housed at Malik-ut-Tujjar’s house at Rishahr. Harbour. Bushire is situated on a bay, the entrance to which measured in a north westerly direction from Bushire town to the nearest part of the Riidhilleh C394GSBBUS—BUS 26 coast, nrlcs in width. The greater part of the bay is very shallow, and a large part of it is occupied by mud flats. Anchorage. —The innermost anchorage for vessels of moderate draught is at the head of a channel called Khtir Daireh, and is situated in the middle of the entrance of the bay. It lies nearly 3 miles north-north-west of the town, and is sheltered on the north-west by a submerged sandbank called Baq’at- al-’Ali, while on the south-east it is joined by a long narrow wall of sand called Lakfeh only 1 to 3 feet below water. The holding ground in the Khar Daireh is good and the soundings 3 to 4 fathoms, but the approach in many places has only 15 to 17 feet of water at high water, and 11 feet at low water. The deepening of a channel across this bar would be costly. Th&lt; ro are no fixed moorings, but there are two gas-buoys which, together with a guiding light on the British Residency, are maintained by the British Government. The inner anchorage has space for about 15 vessels of the B. I. type. In a sham''l the sea becomes rough even here. The outer anchorage, which is unprotected from either a sham l ot &amp; sharqi wind, is five miles from the town and affords unlimited space in about 5 fathoms. There are no dangerous currents or tides in Bushire bay : the tide rises and falls from 4 to 7 feet only* Landing. —There is no pier or wharf where steamers can come alongside, and all landing has to be carried out in boats. The transference of horses, men, and stores to boats is possible all through the year, for B. I. steamers and others call regularly at Bushire; but, if a shamdl were bl wing, the transference might be delayed a day or two. (See climate). The coast is shelving, and generally sandy, but rocky in places, and cliffs run from the south end of the town for about half-a-mile to the south, thence no more cliffs till Rishahr (5| miles), The following places afford facilities for landing: 1. Customs wharf. —Both this place and Pudar landing place are approach ed by the Khur Sultani, a deep creek about 200 yards broad, which runs past the east side of the town in a south-easterly direction towards the Mashileh. It is unfortunately divided from the inner anchorage by a bank 1£ miles broad, on which the soundings are only 5 to 6 feet. A canal through this bank might be dredged without much difficulty. At PQdar, miles above the town, the creek, which has soundings of over 20 feet and is completely sheltered, forks ; one branch continues south-east to the Mashileh, while the other, called Khnr Shakari, bearing at first to the north-east, sweeps round in a great semi-circle and eventually joins the bay at its northern end. On this creek, near the place where it opens again into the bay, is Shif, (^.v.), a landing- place for travellers in the interior. Between the curving creek and the open bay is a mass of mud flats and low islands. The Customs wharf is £ mile long, faced with stone, and is situated about the centre of the town. It boasts only one crane, not in good order, and has no tram lines, though there is a suitable alignment for them alo g the sea shore. Large covered godowns are situated within 50 yards of the wharf. Sea-going craft of 150 tons can come up the Khur Sultani, and get alongside this wharf,BUS—BUS 27 2. Piidar .—A good firm sandy beach, no sudden shelving, suitable for land ing horses. In 1911 the Central India Horse landed their horses here by heel ing the boats over, and making the horses jump. It is always sheltered and is near a site for a temporary camp. 3. British, Town Residency ,—There is a stretch of sandy beach here, 4. Russian Consulate .—Close to the town, conspicuous ; not possible in rough weather; and, except at very high tides, is too shallow for the bigger launches* 5. Rishahr There is a sheltered creek, below the Cable House, where there is a natural landing place for infantry. On account of a bar across the creek, however, boats of large draught cannot enter. It might be possible to blow a gap in this bar. If a southerly wind be blowing a landing cannot be effected here. There is a good covering position. The 79th Carnatics landed here in 1911, and the 39th Central India Horse, in April 1913, embarked their horses here. 6. Halileh.—ln fine weather this is a fair landing place ; but with a southerly wind landing would be impossible. The British army landed here in 1856, as opposition was anticipated ; but under other conditions it has no advantages to compensate for its distance from Bushire. South of Halileh for about a mile there are too many coral rocks cropping up at low tide to allow of landing ; but north of Halileh fishing boats can come close to the shore and landing is possible. Boats .—There are two launches at Bushire : the Residency launch and the Customs launch. Lighters of various kinds are numerous, and the following is an estimate made in 1911 :— Number. Type. Length. Tonnage. Capacity. 60 Mashuvehs otbalams (harbour craft). 30'-50' 10-15 25 men or 8 horses. 50 Satribuqs, bums or large mashu- vehe (trading to Gulf ports). SO'-GO' 30-40 40 men or 12 horses. 25 Baghlehs, (Sea-going vessels) CO'-TO' 50-150 60 men or 20 horses. There are also 350 small fishing boats of a few tons only. In 1911 Messrs Gray, Paul and Company provided 6 medium-sized lighters for the land ing of the Central India Horse. All lighters would require adaptation for use in lightering animals, and Bushire can neither provide carpenters, nor the necessary planking. There are also no particular facilities for the construction of temporary landing stages ; and, except for a very small amount of timber, stones would be the only material available. There are about 1,000-1,500 Dashtis who unload vessels, but during spring and in August and September they are scarce. Crews for the lighters are sometimes difficult to obtain.28 BUS—BUS Camping Ground. The best place for a camp of any size, say for a brigade or larger force, is near the centre of the peninsula, south of Lul, near the Imamzadeh. {cf. No. 2 below). This site has the advantages of being easily defended, having water for animals close at hand, and containing adequate space. The surface, however, is rather stony, and the distance to any landing place is considerable (2| to 3 miles).

The villagers use this tank water for themselves, and at present there is sufficient for 2 cavalry brigades for a month if watered from troughs. Halileh has some supplies including 400-500 sheep and goats. There are 5 wells of fairly sweet water, on the sea shore, w'hich always contain water. (1) An unmetalled road from BQshire, rough and sandy in places. (2) Unmetalled track direct to main caravan route to Ahmadi. (3) Unmetalled road to Rishahr landing place. Two roads lead out of Halileh. (1) Along the shore where it is at first deep with sand and eventually up a rocky pass to the high ground. It is really only a mule track in most places leading to Bushire or Ahmadi. (2) Along the top of the ridge at first only a path, but known as the “ Famine Road ” on the high ground passable for all arms leading to Ahmadi. No roads, only a path leading to Halileh. Soil and space for camp. Soil sandy and at present alto gether under cultivation (barley). Space 450 yards by 450 yards, but could be extended up to 1,000 yards to the west. Soil sandy and fertile space unlimited if area now (Feb ruary 1911), under barley is used. The ground for miles round is open and practically flat. Soil very sandy, especially near the shore. In February 1911 the greater part was under barley cultiva tion and was rather damp. Space. —Roughly 1,000 yards by 500 yards and could be ex tended with advantage fur ther north a- long the shore. Dat# palms give shade. Very sandy soil, and practically level; shade of a few date palms. Space for two brigades. Defenslbllity. Very much sur rounded by buildings and enclosed coun try. Easily defended as ground i s open with no villages near. Some large houses in the vicinity would have to be held close to the telegraph office. The site is easily defended on the north and east the high ground and cliffs form ing strong positions of defence. It is defiladed from the north and east. The camp could be defended easily by hold ing a line east and west across the peninsula about 24 miles to the north. As a site for a base camp No. 5, would be very suitable. The large house belonging to Malik-ut-Tujjar, rented for the Indian detachment in 1912, has accommodation for about 500 men. The house consists of two big court yards. In the outer one are numerous godowns and outhouses, C394GSBBUS—BU9 30 y at present used by the cavalry (50 sabres) for stables ; but which could be made into sepoys’ quarters without much difficulty. In the centre of the outer court is a Divan-i-’Aam, which had a billiard room, etc., and was occupied by the 79th. In the inner courtyard are the main buildings, consisting of six good officers’ quarters and a very large mess upstairs, with two other fair rooms in turrets, and two places available as water closets. Below are similar rooms with inner rooms under the outer verandah. The lower quarters were, in 1912, occupied by the 79th sepoys (250). There is also a ' jini ” double storied anderun on the opposite side of the court, which was used by the 39th below, with hos pital and native officers above. There are also numerous godowns at the back. A tram line from the Customs wharf (about 6 miles) would be essential, unless a break water and pier were built at Rishahr itself. (For Administration see Bushire town). Communications. Roads .—The only road in the peninsula fit for vehicles is one 6 miles in length from Bushire to Sabzabad. In the ordinary sense of the term there are no other roads, but there is a net-work of rough and occasionally sandy tracks varying in width from 6 feet to 25 feet. They are very rough for wheeled traffic. The soil is everywhere sandy, and liable to cut up under much traffic. The whole country is very open and troops could move anywhere without difficulty. The adjoining mainland can be reached by boats, disembarkation taking place at Shlf on the northern coast of the bay, which is reached in about 8 hours ; or by carriage by following the eastern edges of the Bushire peninsula for about 4 miles and then crossing the Mashileh at the same place as the telegraph line. Rain may delay passage across the Mashileh for 4 or 5 days during the winter season. Telegraphs .—The cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, 2 from Jask and 1 from Fao, are landed a few hundred yards west of Rishahr fort, and conducted overland for about 1 mile north-east to the telegraph sta tion. From the Rishahr office three land lines run across the peninsula to the coast and thence to Shiraz. A short line runs direct from the office to the British Resident’s house at Sabzabad, and another line accompanies the Shiraz line to the coast of the'peninsula and then strikes north to Bushire town, where instruments in the British Residency and the Persian Telegraph Office are connected with it. There is a staff of 15 European or Eurasian operators at Rishahr. In 1912 a temporary wireless installation was erected at Rishahr, which has a range of 120 miles by day and 130 by night. The Town Residency, First Assistant Resident’s house, and Sabzabad Residency are connected by telephone. Postal .—There is a British Post Office at Bushirein the British Residency, mails not passing thr ough the Persian posts. Postal arrangements are asBUS—BUS ol follows: Arrivals, Wednesday morning (fast mail) and Sunday (slow mail) Departures, Monday morning (fast mail) and alternately Wednesday and Fri day (slow mail). The Persian post to and from the interior is irregular; but it is supposed to arrive on Thursday and Monday, and to depart on Saturday and Thursday.

This is the chief port of Persia; it is also the principal town on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, and the headquarters of the administrative division known as the Gulf Ports. Its position on the Persian coast is about 190 miles north by east of Manamah in Bahrain, 170 miles east by south of Kuwait and 150 miles east-south-east of the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab. History. On December 10th, 1856, Bushire surrendered to a British force which had landed at Rishahr on December 7.th. In March 1857, the main force proceeded to Mohammerah, leaving 3,000 men to hold Bushire, which was occupied till In January 1911 Saulat-ud-Dauleh came to Bushire, with a horde of tribesmen to meet Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and as a consequence there was much disorder in the town. On April 8th, 1911, Mirza ’Ali Muhammad, Muvaqqar-ud-Dauleh arrived m Bushire as Governor of the Gulf Ports, vice the Daria Begi. Muvaqqar had been kcrguzor in Shiraz, where he was friendly to Quwam-ul-Mulk and hostile to Saulat-ud-Dauleh. In November 1911 the Bushire as well as all other anjumans was abohshed. ' * The year 1911 was marked by much unrest in the districts round Bushire due chiefly to Nizam-us-Sultaneh’s attempts to recover revenue • and a more serious state of affairs supervened when the 39th Central India Horse landed at Bushire, in November 1911, on their way to Shiraz and Isfahan In January 1912, consequent on the attack on the Central India Horse at Kazarun, a detachment of about 250 Indian infantry was landed at Bushire which in addition to a squadron of the 39th, remained at Bushire through out 1912. The presence of these Indian troops at Bushire conduced to keep ing the town^ free of disturbances during 1912, though the district was again much disturbed and Zair Khidr of Tangistan actually blocked the road within 12 miles of Bushire. In April 1913 the headquarters of the Indian battalion on arms traffic fluty in the Persian Gulf was moved from Jask to Bushire, bringing the B ^ gth or!i? ^ about 5 companies. About the same time the squadron ot the 39th Central India Horse was withdrawn to India. Description. Bushire is a compact town. The houses are of stone, and nearlv all have an upper storey. There are only about 1,500 houses, but the popula tion is dense and out of all proportion to the number of dwellings, ihe ordinary budding material is a friable conglomerate of sand and shells. J he town is divided into four wards, or mahallas, styled BehbehanI, Deb- dasiiti, KhashhabI, and Kuti; besides these there are two small quarters occupied oy Jews. At the northern end of the town is an open space called Basidun, between which and the water’s edge is situated a block of buildings containing the Imperial Customs House and the Persian Post Office. The esplanade upon the seaward side runs at some height above the beach and along it are some of the best edifices in Bushire. The furthest building to the south is the British Residency, and a little beyond it is an ah-amban -h or climate see under Bushire Peninsula,BUS—BUS 33 Population.

In 1912 the population was said to be quite friendly to the British Indian troops, whom they came to look upon as protectors from raiding bands. The language usually spoken by the inhabitants is broken Persian, not a quarter of the people speaking pure Persian. English is more used than French. Trade. Bushire is still the chief gateway of foreign trade in Southern Persia. Local trade is conducted in the bazars, which are situated on the east side of the town ; the principal of these is clean, roofed in, and some 211 yards in length. In all there are about 600 shops. The only bank is the Imperial Bank of Persia. The following European firms have depots in Bushire; chiefly for the sale of piece-goods Messrs. Gray, Paul and Company 'l Messrs. Ziegler and Company Messrs. Coddington and Lamb Messrs. Dixon and Company ^ British. Messrs. Malcolm and Company | Messrs. Sassoon and Company j Messrs. Charles I Sassoon and Company J Russian Steam Navigation Company Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company (German.) The trade of Bushire for the last few years has been as follows :— 1906-07. 1907-08. 1908-09. 1909-10. 1910-11. 1911-12. Imports .. £803,842 £1,052,043 £793,405 £717,091 £075,014 £932,531.

C394GSBBUS—BUS * 34 The United Kingdom and India supply over 75% of the imports, and take over 50% of the exports. In 1911-12 the other chief importers were Belgium, France, Germany, and Turkey, while the chief exporters were thma, Germany, Turkey and Egypt. In 1911 German trade flourished considerably on account of the freight rebates which the German-subsidized ships were able to offer for exporting ?n^\o MeSSrS * Wonckhaus and Company shipped 11,500 tons of grain in 1011-12 against 9,500 shipped by all British firms.

Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company. Bucknail Steamship Lines, Limited. Bombay and Persia Steamship Navigation Company. Arab Steamship Lines, Limited. Russian Company of Shipping and Commerce. Administration. Bushire is the head-quarters of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who is appointed directly from Tehran. The Peninsula is also under his juris diction, though in 1908 he farmed the land revenue of the Peninsula to the Katkhuda of Rishahr for 500-600 turnons a year, and the latter maintained 35 to 40 armed men to act as police in the villages. The Persian Foreign office is represented by a Karguzar. In 1912 the revenue collecting was taken over by the Imperial Persian Gulf Customs under Belgian management. This Customs Administration was started in 1903. The principal oflioe of the Persian Gulf is in Bushire. Revenue.—irx 1911 the revenue for Bushire and Rishahr was £2 973, and m 1912 it was assessed at £1,983. The Gulf ports are supposed to* pay £13,766 annually, but actually only pay about half that sum. Customs.—In 1910-11 the Customs receipts were £52,357, a decrease of £ 9,000 from the previous year, and of more than £7,000 from that of 1907- OS, due to insecurity of roads and disorder in Fars. In 1911-12, the re turns indicated a considerable increase, in spite of the chaos in South Persia, due possibly to improved administration: the receipts from Bushire were £96,503. In 1911-12 the expenditure out of customs for salaries, “ navy ” quarantine, and pay of Governor amounted to £32,938. Law .—There are no regular tribunals. Civil disputes are ordinarily settled by the ecclesiastical authorities. British subjects are amenable to the laws of India, for which purpose British Consuls have magisterial powers, and the Resident the powers of a high court. Quarantine .—The British Residency Surgeon is Port Health Officer, and the penalties for infraction of the quarantine regulations are enforced by the Customs authorities.

Habibullah Beg, his son, was powerless ; and the district was taken by the Khans of Borazjun. He was in the service of the Khan for some years, and then transferred to Daliki as Kalantar under the Ears Govern ment. After his death, Muhammed Riza Beg ruled as Kalantar of Daliki, and was killed at Kumarij by Haidar Khan some 11 years ago, his wife having been a cousin of Haidar Khan. Nur Muhammed Beg succeeded him, and the district was sold by the Shah to the Nizam-us-Sultaneh. Nur Muhammed was later given the title of Khan. He is on terms of enmity (1912) with the Khan of Shabankareh, and an ally of Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh of Borazjun. Owing to his close relations, as tenant, with Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Nur Muhammed Khan has succeeded in getting the control of the villages of Dava-guni and Banaki, on the Khisht plain, given to him; his brother Husain Beg generally resides at Banaki. Thus the Kutal-i-Mklum pass is wholly under the control of the Daliki Khans. His nephew Mansur Beg farmed from Mushir-ud-Dauleh in 1911 the village of Jamlleh, in the mountains up the Daliki river, and district. Extortion of large revenue from caravans is the all-important object of the Khan’s policy. In 1912 he was considered ill-disposed towards the British. Geography .—This small district, containing 3 villages only, is bounded on the east by the mountains ; smth by the Borazjun frontier passing about 3 miles north of Qaraul Khaneh. West, the boundary lies along the Zira border to the west of a narrow strip containing the large date planta tions of Sarkavardun and continues about f mile to the west of the Shur river till it reaches the mountains behind Behbara and Mazra’eh. North by the bridge of Daliki : there is nothing but mountains each side of this. Administraiwn.—DaAM is the property of Nizam-us-Sultaneh, the Khan paying some 8,200 turn ns each year to Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and 500 tum~ns to Maghz-ud-Dauleh, his ‘ peshkar ’. Its revenue consists of about 8,000 t~i7n~ins from the date gardens and many thousand tumans from taxation of caravans, and the monopoly of the sale of grain to them. ^ The villages of Daliki district are Daliki (with about 400 houses), Sarkavardun (west of the river), and Kaleh-i-Safid. For climate, resources, etc., see Daliki village.—(CTh'dl’, 1912.) DARTS. A large village in the Kazarun plain west of that town. It was ruled by Darudar Rajab in 1912, who had 100 tufangchis.

The camp of Ayaz Kiha Klmn has usually been near Abdaran and Bibi Haklmeh: that of ’All Panah Kiha Khan (when he is on good terms with Ayaz Kiha) at Sar Abnaniz, 8/arsaMs from Khairabad near Behbehan. For a short time Saulat-ud-Dauleh made’Ali Panah Kiha Khan Kalantar of the Darreh Shuns, and removed Ayaz Kiha Khan, but in 1911 Ayaz Kiha Khan threw in his lot with Saulat-ul-Dauleh, took the bulk of his large clan to the Saulat’s winter-quarters in Qirand Karzin, and in the spring of 1912 fought for the ex-Ilkhani against Zaigham, and other clans. (See also under Qashqai).— (Wilson, 1911 ; Chick, 1912.) DtlDANGEH— A village about 8 miles north-north-west of Behbehan. The village and lands of Dudangeh are the property of Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zafar, and are leased by him to ’Ali Naki Khan, Bahmal, at an annual rental of 2,000 tumcns. The village consists of some 30 houses, capable of turning out 30 able-bodied men, 20 of whom would be armed with rifles. The resources are about 100 cows, 500 sheep and goats, 30 donkeys, and 10 mares together with 4,000 date trees and 50 khish of both irrigated and unirrigated land. The produce per annum is about 200 maunds of rice (Behbehan), 500 maunds of wheat, 50 maunds of linseed, and 3,500 maunda of dates. The taxation is 1,000 tumans annually to the Behbehan Governorship.— (Ranking, 1910). DUSHMAN ZIARI— For present entry substitute the following:— The Dushman Ziari are a wild, lawless tribe, a sub-division of the Chehar BanlchehMKfihgalu, though sometimes classed as Mamasani. They are under the leadership of Surab Khan, and, together with the Taiyibi, are in the habit of attacking and looting caravans on the Lynch Road, the usual scenes of their attacks being the Gardan-i-Barrak, KalehMadrassehand Kikat (Darreh Barfl). Their best known Chief was Muhammad Riza Khan, who was executed by the then Governor of Shiraz, Prince Faridun Mirza, in 1840. In 1905 their Chief was As’adullah Khan. The sub-divisions of the Dushman Ziari are as follows :— Sultan ! Ali. Qalandari. Shaikh ’All. Sau Dinar!, SirkakkI, Buiri. ’Aziz!.’ Shaikh Abbas!, Nukr. Sa’adat.They number in all 400 families, and are capable of putting 600 fighting men into the field, 400 of whom are armed with rifles. Of these rifles a largo percentage are Martinis, while the remainder are 5-shot rifles of German make, and a few British ’303. The latter are very highly prized and much sought after, not only by this particular sub-tribe, but by the Kuhgalus in general. In former times the Dushman Ziari used to number as many as 1,000 families, but, owing to the oppression of their chiefs, they have scat tered, some to the Bakhtiaris and some to the Arabs in the Zaidan district. They inhabit the country between Behbehan, Kazarun, Ardakan and Shu- listan, and Kaleh Safid to Basht. This description gives wide limits and the following boundaries (Ranking) may be more exact Kaleh-i-Rak, Deh Chul, Kuh-i-Shirin, Badum, Samarhum, Kaleh-i-Gul-i-Parish Kaft. Their winter quarters are Kalat, Kaleh-i-Rak-i-Mehdi Khan, Dasht-i-Mazadak; and summer quarters Chehar Rah, Chiftu, Kallal, Kuh-i-Min, Sar Kuhak, Kuh- i-Surb, Gil ^Safid, Benar-i-Gurgir, Tang-i-Shikari, Dalun, ’Savakar. The following forts are in their territories Kaleh-i-Kalat, inhabited by Surab Khan, and Kaleh-i-Rak inhabited by Mehdi Quli Khan. The Dushman Ziari are on friendly terms with the Taiyibi (Sarhadi) and Buir Ahmadi, but on bad terms with the Bakhtiari.

Not more than 50 rifles of sorts are to be found in this village. The inhabitants own about 200 cows, 3,000 sheep and goats, 100 donkeys, 20 mules and horses, together with 100 khish of wheat cultivation and 8,000 date trees. They produce about 200 maui.ds (Behbehan) of rice; 7,000 maunds of dates. The taxation of the villages is 1,050 tumdns payable annually to the Behbehan Governorship. As internal tax ’Ali Naki Khan levies a tax of 3 krdns per annum per date tree, and takes £ produce or its equivalent.— (Ranking, 1910). KAMARIJ (District)— History .—About 1905, in the time of Haidar Khan, its late chief, the district of Kamarij was more important than to-day. Haidar Khan, by force of arms, obtained unlimited control from the top of the Kutal-i-Malum to Kazarun, where he established himself as Deputy Governor, and turned out and defeated Khwaja Ibrahim, Kaldntar of Kazarun. Haidar Khan died of wounds inflicted by a slave at Kazarun in September 1909, leaving an infant son, Farajullah Khan, in the guardianship of a black confidant Khiirshid. The latter possessed considerable talents, and great bravery. He had to repel attacks by a brother of the late Haidar Khan, and constant aggression from men, whom he had outlawed from Kamarij, including the well-known ’Ali Muhammad. The Kashkulis were bitter enemies of his, and coveted the district. In the spring of 1911 Nizam-us-Sultaneh deter mined to attack Kamarij, urged on by Saulat-ud-Dauleh. Several hundred Qashqals with other partisans of Nizam bombarded the village, and Khurshid, after shutting himself up in the Khan’s fort, on which many of his own villagers fired, escaped to the Kuh-i-Mast. He was gradually joined by his adherents, and returned in June 1911 to Kamarij, when he destroyed most of the houses in the village to prevent the inhabitants oppos ing him again. He made a great show of ruling, not in his own right, but on behalf of Farajullah Khan. Khurshid Khan had always been friendly to the British, and in December 1911, gave warning about the attack on Mr. Smart at Rahdar. In August 1911, he was accidentally killed, and Kamarij was taken over by Mulla Quli on behalf of Haidar Khan’s son. Haidar Khan’s widow had married Husain Beg of Daliki, and his daughter had married Khwaja ’Abdullah, Nasir-ud-Divan, Kaldntar of Kazarun, so the family was closely connected with its neighbours. During the latter part of 1912 the Kamarijis were continually quarrelling with the KashkiiHs, being supported by the Kazarunis. Kunar, Takhteh (Khisht) DalakI, Borazjun, and Shabankareh were all mixed up in these quarrels, the last three siding with Kamarij. In 1912 Kamarij maintained about 70 road guards.44 Geography .—The principal portion of the Kamari] district consists of a level plain stretching from a little beyond the top of the Kutal-i-Kamarij to the southern end of the Tang-i-Turkan, and measuring some four miles by three miles. But the actual boundaries at present are : on the north, the southern end of Tang-i-Turkan; south, the village of Charum on the banks of the Shapur river, beyond the foot of the Kamari] Kutal; east, the mountains Kuh-i-Mast and Kuh-i-Gunjishk, which separate the district from the Kazarun plain ; west, the river Shapur at Rudak, which belongs to Kamarij. Only five villages are in the district :—Kamarij (about 150 houses inhabited), Rudak, Banaft, Charum. Caravanserai (Deh Kuhneh). It formerly was part of the sub-government of Khisht, but is now owned by Mushir-ud-Dauleh, to whom the revenue is paid. Qashqai clans are neighbours to the district on three sides : the Kashkuli and Chehar Bunicheh tribes outside the further extremity of the Tang-i- Turkan and near Bushakun : the Farsimadan about four miles the further side of the Kuh-i-Mast: the Kashkuli again about seven miles to the west of Rudak. Communications.—T^here are two alternative routes between Kazarun, Kamarij and Kunar Takhteh. One, the Rah-i-Bardun, over the Kuh-i-Mast, is often used by caravans to Kazarlin, when Kamarij is at strife with the Kashkfills. The other route from Kazarun leaves the main track at the caravansarai and passes by the Kuh-i-Surkh road to the north of Kmuarij till it descends on to the Kunar Takhteh plain, thus avoiding the Tang-i- Turkan, Kamarij and the Kutal-i-Kamarij altogether. KASHKULI— A tribe of the Qashqai of Fars. This tribe, in numbers third in importance among the Qashqai, is in influence at present (1912) the second or even the first. The Khans of the Kashkuii estimate the number of tents at about 5,0C0, and the number of armed tribesmen at 2,000 to 3,000. The chief of the tribe was said to main tain in 1912, about 400 road guards. They are extensive agriculturists both in their summer and winter quarters. The former are in the Kuh-i-Mihr and Kakan, the latter all romd the Mehlatun hills. TheKashkulis were originally a Fars tribe pure and simple, i.e., their winter haunts were in what they call “ Fars,” between Jahrum and Lar: their rise in importance among the Qashqais dates from early in the 19th century. Some families of the Zend tribe (to which Karim Khan belonged) migrated or fled from the K rmansh ih district, and settled with the Qashqai. One of these families soon attained to leadership among the Kashkulis, and formed matrimonial alliances with Jani Khan, the Ilkhani, and his family. The most noted of these Zand or Kashkuli Khans was Qasim Khan, who died in the year of the British war. He was respons ible for the branch finding a new habitat in the mountains from Shapur to Hai’at Baud, for the Kashkulis and Qashqais had not spread to that side before. The descendants of his brother Haji ’Abbas ’Ali are still settled in the direction of Gallehdar and Qir and Karzin, and the tribe is apparently known not as Kashkuli, but as (Afshar) Kirmani. AllKAZ—KHU 45 Kashkulis meet round the Kuh-i-Mihr (Qumeir) in the summer. Qasim Khan and his brothers had a numerous progeny, so that the Khans say that of their grandfathers’ descendants they can muster a hundred riflemen. The late Ilyas Khan was famed throughout southern Persia for his extra ordinary strength. The llkhani, Sau:at-ud-Dauleh, is not only the son of a Kashkuli mother but he is married to a daughter of Haji’Abdullah Khan, nephew of Qasim Khan : Ins wife s sister is married to Haidar ’Ali Khan Kashkuli, brother of Muhammad ’Ah Khan. Like the llbegi, Saulat us-Sultaneh, some of the younger Kashkuli Khans have begun to k.ke lessons in English. Owing to the character and warlike qualities of Muhammad ’Ali Khan and Muhammad Beg, the Kashkulis have acqu red great importance. There is usually enmity between the two sections, led by the brothers, but they once joined to oppose Saulat-ud-Dauleh. ’ ‘ The Kashkulis are said to breed mules, of which they own 400. (See also under Qashqai.)— (C7mc&amp;, 1912). kAzarun— Enter the following under their respective headings :— Population .—In 1912 Chick estimated the population at 12,000. Supplies and Resources.—(hoiore the 1st paragraph). The Kazarun plain is extremely fertile : grain, opium, tobacco and beans are chiefly grown. Towards the Shapar end are rice swamps, and a large amount of rice is imported to Kazarun from Shulistan and the Mamasani district. Davan, which is high up on the hillside, some 7 miles from Kaza run, produces large quantities of raisins. Kazarun and Davan are also noted for the numbers of mules used on transport work, and owned by the inhabitants. Military.

KHADIRI.— The Khadiri -sub-division of the Liravi Kuhgalu are a wealthy sub-tribe of pastoral and agricultural pursuits, living in villages, under the chief tainship of Haji Husain-i-Shah Quli who lives in the Umari village of the Khadiri. C394GSBKUH—KUH 46 It may be here mentioned that the Liravi take their name originally from a large tract of land of the same name, inhabited by the above sub-tribes. The soil itself of this land is most fertile, but lacks water for irrigation pur poses, such water as exists being from wells. The following tabulation shews the Khadiri village and the number of houses in each—• Houses. Houses.

For resources taxation, etc., see under Kuhgalu.— {Ranking, 1910). KHANEH PANE— A village in the Yazd district, about 65 miles east of Yazd, and 12 miles west of Bafq. Khaneh Panj is situated on the edge of the great Kavlr, (or salt plain) which extends all the way from Zarand. It consists of a stable and some small out houses, little vaulted chambers more like hen-coops than human habitations. Close by are two tanks of foul and brackish water, greasy, slightly sickening, and overlying a deposit of black mud.— (Stack). KHIDK (?).— A village about 42 miles from Yazd, a mile to the left of the road going towards Kirman.— (Abbott). KHUlGAN.— Elev. 8,143'.— A small Armenian village in the Faridan district of the Isfahan province: Government property. It is 18| miles from Nimagird, and 191 from Isfahan Water from streams; wood practically nil : district treeless : barley and chopped straw obtainable : other supplies practically unobtainable.—(BeZC Schindler), KUHGALU (COUNTRY).— For History, Ethnography, Administration and Military see under KuhgalQ (Tribe.) Geography. The information at present available regarding the Kuhgalu country is very scanty. The following account is taken mainly from Lieut^enfc Wilson’s report on the Kuhgalu country (1909).KUH—KUH 47 Boundaries .—On the north, the boundary of the Kiihgalii country is indefi nite : but it may be said that the head-waters of the Ab-i-’Ala, rising in the Mangasht mountains are in their hands, and that the country to within a few miles of the Karun near Bars is theirs. Their territory also extends to near Lurdagan—a district inhabited by a settled Bakhtiari population. To the east, we know nothing of the Kuhgalu-Qashqal boundary, beyond the fact that Bell mentions Sisakht and Khurra as Kuhgalu territory. We may assume, then, that, at all events in 1888, the prominent Kuh-i-Dinar formed the Kuhgalu Qashqal boundary. To the south also we know nothing definite. Kaleh-i-Aru is in the hands of the Buir Ahmadi, Basht belongs to the Bavi, a tribe of Arab extraction, who many years ago joined the Kuhgalu. South of Basht and Behbehan are various gwcm'-Kuligalu tribes, classed by Baring in 1882 as Zir-i-Kfih Kuhgalu. They are Kiihgalu, however, only in name, like the Bakhtiari in the Ramuz district. To the west, our knowledge is somewhat more exact, but is complicated by the fact that certain sections of the Bahmai tribe, who are undoubtedly Kuhgalu by origin, have in recent years owned allegiance to the Bakhtiari, to whom they pay a light tribute. Their territory must, however, be con sidered as Kuhgalu country, though not within the administrative province of Ears, as is nominally the case with other administrative tribes. Kai Kaus, the site of Sassanian ruins, and of a fire temple in good preservation, is just on the Kuhgalu side of the border, which runs north-west, nearly parallel to the Ramuz-Behbehan road, to a point 2 miles west of Pijan on the Ab-i-Bulfarls. From this point it runs north-east, crossing the Daliin- Bulfaris road midway between Batik and Bulfarls, and Kuh-i-Bengistun and Tanbulun to a point midway between Talavar and Kaleh-i-’Ala. The former is a Bakhtiari village, the latter the head-quarters of a section of the Bahmar, tributary to the Bakhtiari. North of Talavar, a small tract of land, known as Saiyidfm, extending to Shah-i-Mangasht, is in the hands of another section of Bahmai, under Zaki Khan, also tributary to the Bakhti ari. The south slopes of the Mangasht, for the most part, and all the east slopes, are in the hands of Bahmai who own allegiance to Muhammad Husain Khan of Kaleh-i-’Ala, or to ’All Murad Khan of Dishmuk. Rivers .—The Kuhgalu country is drained by two great rivers, the Karun and the Jarrahi, and by both the main branches of the latter, viz., the Ab-i- ’Ala and the Ab-i-Marun. The principal Kuhgalu tributaries of the Karun are the Ab-i-Bars and the Daria-i-Gandum. The Ab-i-’Ala rises on the ^ east slopes of Mangasht, and drains the country to within a few miles of Dishmuk, falling eventually into the Rud-i-Zard, of which it forms the grea ter part. The basin of the Ab-i-Behbehan, or the Ab-i-Marun, is apparently entirely Kuhgalu country. Dishmuk (6,500') is near the head of each of these systems : the Dishmuk Valley itself drains south to Behbehan. Two miles to the east the country drains into the Ab-i-’Ala, and a few miles to the north, into the Ab-i-Bars. All these streams are snow-fed, and sweet. The mountains run north-north-west and south-south-east, as elsewhere, but the rivers cut through them forcibly, and, generally speaking, have a north-east and south-west trend.KUH—KUH 48 Mountains .—From Malamlr south-south-cast, to Behbehan extends a loft£, though not continuous, range of limestone hills from 9,000' to 10,000' in elevation, which contrast sharply with the low sandstone and gypsum hills of the Bakhtiari Garmsir. They form a solid barrier between the Bakhtiari and the Kiihgalu territories, and are the cause of the backward state of the Kuhgalu as compared with their neighbours. East of this barrier, extends an elevated plateau, at the head of which lies the Dishmuk Valley : the plateau is broken by hills, prominent amongst which are the gaunt limestone saddle-backs of Kilh-i-Barf-i-Kiin, and Kuh-i-Nil. The latter is probably not less than 10,000' high, and its summit is over 4,000' above the general level of the vicinity. Places of importance .—The capital of the Kuhgalu country, if any place can be called such, is Behbehdn (q.v.). It is here that the governor of the Kuhgalu resides. Other important places are Dishmuk in the north, and Basht in the south. For forts in the Kuhgalu country see under the separate tribes Buir Ahmadi, Dushman Ziari, Bavi and Bahmai. Climate and Health .— The climate of the Kuhgalu country resembles that of the Bakhtiari country in being hot in the low country in the summer (as high a temperature as 124° in the shade having been registered in midsummer), and temperate in the winter. In the high country, the temperature is equable in the summer, but extremely cold in the winter. I he little valley of Dishmuk (6,500') is said to be under snow for several months in winter, but the flimsy dwellings of the inhabitants, who live there all the year round, indicate that the cold is not severe for long. Resources. Water .—The streams mentioned under Rivers are snow fed and sweet, but there is no further information regarding water except along the routes {q.v.). Supplies.—-The Kuhgalu country is inhabited by probably not more than 10,000 families, the majority of whom are pastoral, relying upon acorns rather than corn, for their daily bread. There in no export of grain as far as can be ascertained ; yet the country is well-watered and fertile, and could support a population 20 times as great as it does at present. Little grain is grown in the district, the crops only sufficing for the normal needs of the population. The surplus for sale is thus small, and large caravans would have drflrculty in obtaining supplies : a reserve, at all events for horses, of several days’ grain should therefore be carried. For mules, the excellent a ' grazing available will serve as a substitute for grain for the brief period when none can be obtained (see tables). It is well wooded, mainly with ballut (dwarf oak), but there are many other trees, such as walnut, apricot, jujube, fig, etc., whose fruit, together with the acorn, is a staple food for the tribesmen. Cypress trees, from which large quantities of timber are cut, are found in the Tang-i-Sarvak : the timber goes to Behbehan. A tea plant is found growing wild on the hill slopes between the Kuh-i-Siah and Kuh-i-Safid, and is to some slight extent used by the poorer of the local Lurs, who cannot afford, or who run out of. the more costly manufactured imported article.HUH—KUH 49 W &amp; Annuals. —There are few horses, mules or donkeys, in the district. The people are not really migratory, and do not need them. Their winter quarters are in the valleys ; their summer camps in the hills, 6 miles or so off. Mule breeding does not seem to be practised, though these animals are fre quently stolen from the Bakhtiari road. Bullocks are commonly in use for local transport, but even these only suffice for actual requirements. See Tables. Trade. —The principal exports, are ghi, wool and country cloth, rope of goat-hair, skins, and walnuts. In return, felt, cotton cloth, iron goods, tea, sugar, itc., are purchased at Ramuz or Behbehan, as well as arms and ammunition. Some trade, especially that of the Buir Ahmadi, goes to Ardakan. The Bahmai deal mainly with Ramuz. This traffic, such as it is, is carried on, not by the tribesmen themselves, but by agents, whose general usefulness ensures the safety of their caravans wherever they may go. Such men form the necessary link between the various hostile tribes, and the external markets. Arts and Crafts. —The women of the tribe weave coarse woollen carpets and gilims from wool produced by their own flocks, the dyes being obtained from the trade marts mentioned above. Unfortunately, however, the practice of using an admixture of aniline with fast dyes is on the increase, to the detriment of the industry concerned. The women also weave coarse woollen wrappings (Lur : Khur) about 9' 6' by 3', which are used chiefly for sewing up into sacks fer the transport of grain, etc. The black goats’ hair cloth, used exclusive’y in the construction of their tents, is also woven by the women and gills of the tribe, usually in lengths of about 20' by 3'. Crafts found among the tribe are few and of the very simplest nature, the moy ccirmcn being that of the blacksmith, with here and there an armourer or a carpenter, and each sub-division has its own £ ‘ medicine man.” Minerals.—In n : s found in the Tang -i-Maghar, and coal and lignite in that place and the Kfih-i-Dinar in Bf ir Ahmadi country. Oil and bitumen are obtained in a valley close to, and east of the Tang-i-Tikan, and in a valley near Tashan (q.v.). At the Tang-i-Tikan the oil exists in a form which is technically known as “ shows ” and flows into a local stream, on the surface of which it is borne away. Sulphur is found at Tang-i-BTn, Tang-i-Bizak, Tang-i-Shibr, off the Tang-i-Chavil, and from numerous sulphur springs. Mumai, or “ mumani ” as it is called by the Kuhgalu, is found in various places in their country ; the best being obtained at Tang-i-Tikan, whence 200 misqdls are taken annually to Behbehan and there sold for export to various parts of Persia. It s also found at Tang-i-Bin, Kuh-i-Bivara, and Kaleh Nauzar (Kaleh Nadir). It is a black wax-like substance valued for its healing properties. C391CSI3KUH—KUH 51 Animals. Tribe. Cows. Sheep.

Water is abundant and some supplies procurable, except at the first stage where both are scarce. From Behbehan a further advance could be made into the the heart of the country via Baba Ahmed (route 64) and the Tang-i-Saulak north-west of Behbehan, or via Deh Dasht (route 63) north-* ast of Behbehan. 2. Kazarun to Behbehan via Tal Aspid, 133 miles in seven stages. This route traverses Mamasani and Zir-i-Kuh Kuhgalu territory, and is mostly over rough hilly country only passable for mules. Water is procurable in abundance, and supplies at several places. 3. Ahwaz to Dalfm via Ramuz 86 miles in 5 stages, and also to Dlshmuk 109 miles in 8 stages. Both difficult roads after Ramuz, but might be useful for getting into Bahmai Kuhgalu country. 4. Asupas on the Shiraz-lsfahan road (Sarhad route) to Sisakht (Kuh-i- Dlnar), on the eastern border of Buir Ahmadi country. Nothing is known regarding this route. There are probably other routes across from the Shiraz-lsfahan road. ?? 5. From several points on the Bakhtiarl (Lynch) Road, e.g., Kaleh Mad- rasseh via Bars to Dishmuk, for the Dushman Ziarl and Bahmai tribes ; Du Pulan to Lurdagan for the Nuyi tribe ; and Ardal to Sisakht (Kuh-i-Dinar) for the Buir Ahmadi. There aie no tracks in common use by large caravans across the Kuhgalu country. This absence of routes is, however, probably due rather to the in hospitable nature of the people than to the difficulty of the ground. From Ahwaz to Isfahan straight lines via Ramuz and Ganduman are 218 miles against 275 by the Lynch road. A track exists via Tang-i : Chavil and Dlshmuk, which is almost exactly on these straight lines, and whichKUH—KUH 52 could be easily improved sufficiently to make it, at all events, better than many parts of the Lynch road. Tribal feuds, however, prevent this road being used for the present (1909), and DIshmuk must be reached either wd Tang-i-Saulak or via Bars. From Dishmuk toLurdagan a reasonably good track is said to exist via Bard-i-Kirm, and from Lurdagan to Isfahan the road is known to be good. Such a road would be 25 per cent, shorter than the Lynch road, and the fact that its existence and practicability was known to us would be a valuable asset to us in dealing with the Bakhtiari Khans, should difficulties arise regarding the road. The crossing of the Karan would be avoided, and, as it appears that no streams not easily fordable are met with, the construction of expensive bridges would be unnecessary. De Bode (1845) mentions an ancient paved way leading up the Tang-i- Saulak to Isfahan, and he saw Parthian scluptures on rocks at the same place. This might well have been an ancient route between Behbehan and Isfahan. KCHGALtf (TRIBE). (The following is culled chiefly from Lieutenant Ranking s report on the Kuhgalu Tribes.) Jr History. The Kuhgalu are sprung, in all probability, from the original Lur stock, but who they were, and whence they came, is merely a matter of conjecture ; for they are a people without history, literature, or education, and with few tribal traditions. Baron G. A. de Bode in 1845 visited the country and mentions among other things a spring with sacred fish at Tashan ; but in 1910 no trace of this could be found, though Tashan shows the remains of what, probably at the time of the Atabegs, was a large town. There are also ancient inscriptions and archaeological remains at Tang-i-Band, iang-i- Sarrak, Gurri and Siah Gul. , ^ , , About 1882 the Kuhgalu were the object of a merciless visitation by b arhad MIrza, who was Governor General of Pars up to that date. They, however, soon recovered and resumed their predatory habits. Circumstances have hitherto (1909) prevented His Britannic Majesty s Consul from opening up direct relations with any of the Kuhgalu thiels, though it is admittedly desirable that this should be done Captain Lorimer in 1907 met Husain Khan Bahmai, brother of ’AH Naqi, and received a cordial invitation to visit the Kuhgalu country. This fact, added to the favourable reception by ’Ali Murad Khan of Dishmuk of Lieutenant Wilson in 1909, shows that the Kuhgalu chiefs were anxious to open friendly intercourse. ^ . . i Tribal dissensions make it impossible for the Kuhgalu to present a bold front to an enemy. Some of the Bahmai have in consequence made a show of submitting to the Bakhtiari, but the bitterness between the rank and file of the Bakhtiari and Kuhgalu tribes is (1908) great and not likely to di minish. The predatory tendencies of the latter at the expense of the former culminated in an expedition by the Bakhtiari against the Bahmai of All Murad Khan in February 1908. A force of about 3,000 men, after a 1 i delay at Dalun and Sarileh advanced up the Tang-i-Ghavil to Dishmuk. BiKUH—KUH 53 they effected nothing, beyond killing a few Saiyids, and burning their huts. The fort of Dishmuk itself was too strong for them to storm, and they were compelled to withdraw. The tribe principally concerned in the highway robberies and murders of BakhtiarJs on the Lynch road is by universal consent the Taiyibi, but it is asserted that their operations would be impossible without the assistance, or at all events the permission, of ’All Murad Khan of Dishmuk, whose land must be crossed by them on their raiding expeditions. ’All Murad Khan was therefore fastened upon as being morally responsible, and as being a man of substance, the Taiyibi on the other hand being nomads with no immovable property. The Kuhgalu seem to have been entirely unaffected by the disturbances of 1909, which culminated in the deposition of the Shah. They did not raid the roads, nor cause any trouble, except perhaps near Shiraz in con junction with the Qashqai. In November 1909 the Buir Ahmadi, in conjunction, it is said, with Muhammad ’Ali Khan, Kashkull, made a carefully planned and successful raid on the Russian Consul-General’s caravan. In July 1911 ’Ali Naqi Khan chief of the Ahmadi Bahmai was murdered at the instigation of his nephew Darvlsh Khan, who took over the chieftain ship and the chief’s fort at Likak ; but the murdered man’s brother Husain Khan, by means of treachery, managed to murder Darvlsh Khan, and in turn assumed the chieftainship. During 1911, Bahadur-i-Divan was Deputy Governor of Behbehan and consequently in charge of the Kuhgalii, and though Nizam-us-Sultaneh was appointed to the post in February 1911, he did not himself take it up, and his deputies only held it for a short time, during which disturbances were rife. In October 1911, Amir-i-Mujahid, Bakhtiari, was nominated Deputy Governor, partly because he was a relation of the Bahmais, but neither he nor his deputies reached Behbehan till a year later when, at the instance of Sardar-i-Jang, Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari, under whom the Kuhgalu were placed, he was at last persuaded to take up the appointment. He then seized Dishmuk and garrisoned it with Bakhtiaris. During 1911 and 1912 the Kuhgalu maintained their notoriety for raiding. The Taiyibi freely plundered caravans on the Lynch road, and the Bakhtiaris made no effort to restrain them. In March 1912 a band of about 400 Kuhgalus had possession of the Urchlnl pass on the Shiraz-Isfahan road, and plundered caravans at will. At the end of September 1912 the Buir Ahmadi attacked and routed two parties of sowars sent out from Shiraz to meet the new Governor General, and in December 1912 the same tribe was said to be responsible for the attack, in which Captain Eckford was killed. Early in 1913 Amlr-i-Mujahid arranged for two columns to enter the Kuhgalu country, in order to coerce the Taiyibi Dushman Zlarl, and part of the Buir Ahmadi into submission. A northern column, composed chiefly of Bakhtiaris with some friendly Bahmai, entered the country from Ramuz and Mamatain. This column was cut off by the Taiyibi Kuhgalus, who held the Tang-i-ChavIl in its rear, and was then attacked and dispersed. Another column operating from Behbehan, supported by Shukrullah’s sec- C39433BKUH-KUH 54 tion of the B^ir Ahmadi, was reported to have achieved wonders against the Bulr Ahmadi. This column also attempted to coerce the Mamassani, and with this object called in the co-operation of the Kashkull. The net result, however, of the whole appears to have been negligible, and the Bakhtlarl road was subjected to Kuhgalu raids as usual. About this time the strange phenomenon was presented of some Bhir Ahmadi under Mulla Qubad, regularly escorting caravans on the Bushire- Isfahan road, between Aminabad and Abadeh, and thus rendering the The Kuhgalii or Kfihgilui, as they are sometimes called, find a meaning for their appellation in the derivation “ Kuh-i-GiluI ” or the “ Dwellers of the earth hills.” They are, for the greater part, nomads like their neighbours the Bakhtlarls, with the difference, however, that their annual migrations are much shorter than those of their neighbours, and are often restricted to moving from the valley bottoms to the upper mountain slopes. They are sub-divided into tribes and sub-tribes, given in detail later, which are often separated by bitter and implacable blood-feuds. The Kuhgalu consider themselves distinct from the Bakhtiaris; their dialect, however, differs but little from that of the Bakhtiari, and their man ners, customs, character and religion are the same. Few Kuhgalu can under stand ordinary Persian. The mode of life and habits of the Kuhgalu are very primitive, and their Chiefs have even less of the veneer of civilization than those of western Luristan. They are roughly dressed, often without shoes, and are more uncouth than the Bakhtiari. Their administration (q.v.) is of the patriarchal form, common to all tribes of the Lur stock, and their form of taxation is light. In looks, they are living images of the figures which are found in the rock carvings in their country, both in features, mode of dressing their hair and, to a great extent, their clothing. The tribe numbers about 25,000 families, and estimates vary from 10,000 to 20,000 regarding the number of fighting men the tribe could raise (see table under Military). These figures take no account of the settled population of Behbehan, Zaidan and I.iravi-Dasht {q.v.). The Kuhgalu tribe is divided in two different ways, ethnographically and geographically, thus causing some confusion, especially as authorities differ as to the classification in each case. The two main sub-divisions ethnographi cally are:— road comparatively safe. Ethnography. (a) Chehar Bariicheh, sub-divided into :■ Bulr Ahmadi. Dushman Ziari. Churam. Nuyi. Bavl. (b) Liravi, sub-divided into ;— Khadirl. Agha Jarl. [N.B .—Yusufi are connected with the Bahmai ].KUH-KUH 55 When divided by locality they are known as Pusht-i-Kuh (hill tribes) and Zir-i-Kuh (plain dwellers), and are grouped as follows :— The inhabitants of Behbehan, Zaidan, Humajat, Liravi (coast district), and Bandar Dilam are also classed as Zir-i-Kiih Kuhgalus, but they are this system is followed in this article. For a description of the inhabitants of those places see under their respective names. Details regarding the sub- Characteristics .—In 1909 Lieutenant Wilson said the Kuhgalu were gen erally of smaller build, less good looking, less striking in appearance, but more daring, more suspicious, more thievish, and more savage, though less well armed than the Bakhtiari. Probably only one man in three had a ser viceable rifle, and grown men carried a little sling, wherewith to slay birds and other small animals. ” In 1910, however, Lieutenant Ranking said :— “ The Kuhgalu are infinitely better armed and physically are a finer raco than their neighbours the Bakhtiaris, or the tribes who inhabit Western Lur- istan. They are wild and lawless, most notably the Taiyibi, who have gained an unenviable notoriety in connection with their depredations on the Lynch Road (Ahwaz to Isfahan via the Bakhtiari Country).” Since then they have probably armed themselves still better as Behbehan had become, in 1912, a depot for the sale of arms, and many cargoes were probably run across from the Arabian coast to near Bandar Dilam. Relations with British .—In 1909 Lieutenant Wilson wrote as follows regard ing British relations with the Kuhgalu. “ The principal Kuhgalu chiefs are anxious to open up friendly relations with the British. That it is desirable from our point of view that such should exist is indisputable. The existence of important British interests, in the shape of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s works, at Mamatain, close to the Kuhgalu border, is in itself a sufficient justification, for the population of Mamatain consists mainly of Kala Kaj Kuhgalu (Bahmai). We must not put all our eggs into one basket by cultivating the friendship of the BakhtiHri to the neglect of the Kuhgalu, whose virile qualities will sooner or later en sure them a position and a hearing in the settlement of local problems.” Should the Kuhgalu wish to annoy the Bakhtiari, they could easily seize Mamatain, and could not readily be turned out, though their numbers, only one fifth of the Pakhtiarls make it unlikely that they could oiler a prolonged resistance!

Military. \KUH—KUH 56 Feuds .—The Kfihgalu na a tribe are much weakened by the almost inces sant feuds existing between the different divisions. In 1909 the principal inter-tribal feuds were as follows :— Bfiir Ahmadi versus Dushman Ziari. Bahmai versus TaiyibI (part only). Bahmai of Zaqi Khan') Bahmai of Muhammad )■ versus Bahmai of ‘All Murad Khan. Husain Khan J Mr. Chick in 1910 said the Kuhgalii as a whole leant more towards the Qashqai than the Bakhtiarl, with whom they are usually at enmity. They have also been known to combine with the Mamassani, who are sometimes even classed as Kuhgalus. Travels .—On account of the fact that the Kiihgalu tribes are split up into a number of mutually hostile factions, these must be reckoned with when moving from valley to valley. In 1909, however, Wilson said there was no reason to suppose that any serious obstacle would be encountered (jby a suitably qualified officer, who took care to travel as far as possible under the auspices of the various Khans. A qualified officer would have no difficulty in seeing most of the KuhgalQ country, though he w T ould have to be chary of, open note-taking and of instrumental observations, as the Kuhgalu tribes men are suspicious in the extreme of such doings in their country. The best time for travel in the Kuhgalu country is spring and early summer, when grass is abundant, and animals can graze. Grain and fodder are scarce. Punitive measures .—It would be extremely difficult to inflict summary punishment on any section of the Kuhgalu, especially on the Buir Ahmadis or the TaiyibI, who are the w T orst offenders, as their country is difficult of access, their property mostly moveable, and their migrations short. The following table gives the location of the several divisions of the Kuh- galu with their estimated fighting strength, w r hich in most cases is an arbitrary figure, differing greatly under difierent authorities. Administration. Revenue .—The Kuhgalu except the Bahmai, who are under the Bakhtiarls, are under the Governor of Behbehan, w T ho until recently was under the Gover nor-General of Ears, but is now under the Bakhtiarl Ilkhani (1912). Each divi sion has its own chiefs, who are responsible for the annual tribute, So long as this is paid, and the tribes do not harass their Persian neighbours or en gage in serious hostilities among themselves, their internal government is not greatly interfered with. Speaking generally w r e may say that all the various sub-tribes, which go to make up the Kuhgalu, are taxed on the same principle, with but minor points of difference between the various systems. Their malidt or taxation is of two kinds, viz. :— (a) KhcJcl and (6) Badi or Sari, Khaki being taxation on cereals and pro perty, w r hile Sari is a poll-tax. Tenants usually pay Khaki, at a rate of J or J produce in kind, to the land lord, in addition to the Sari. The taxation is not heavy and bears but lightly on the tribesmen.KURA-I-KHAMSEH— A village or group of settlements in the Kazarun district of Pars. For merly owned by the Imam Juma’ of Shiraz, but forcibly seized by the Kash- hull and Farsimadan Khans in the autumn of 1912.) KURDISTAN (2)— A village a few miles north-west of Behbehan. The village is the private property of Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz- Zafar, and was leased to ’Ali Naki Khan, Bahmai, for an annual payment of 750 tumans. The village contains some 40 houses, capable of supplying 40 fighting men, 30 of whom are armed with rifles. The village owns about 100 cows, 1,000 sheep, 100 donkeys, 10 mares together with 500 date trees and 100 khish of both irrigated and unirrigated land, in which barley and wheat are chiefly grown. It produces, surplus to amount required for home consumption, about 200 maunds (Behbehan) of rice and 600 maunds of dates. The taxation is 750 tumans, paid annually to the Behbehan Governor ship, on account of the Central Government tax (Per : Dlvdni) while to the lessee, the villagers give 1,500 maunds produce in kind in lieu of taxation. The inhabitants are mixed Kuhgalus and Behbehanis(RanHw^, 1910.)

The continuance of smuggling and the insecurity of roads prevented British trade from making any progress. Page 595 before “ Harbours ” add the following Military .-—In 1910 it was reported that 972 arms, including Mauser pistols, had been landed in the Lingeh district, and in 1911 about 2,760 rifles were landed. There is a ready sale for good arms among the Arab tribes of Laris- tan, though some of the rifles imported by Laris and Ivazls find their way to Yazd into the hands of Afghans trading with that place. Many Afghans also come to Lingeh , but more of them go to Lar, where the market of arms appears to be situated. LIE AVI (Tribe)— A division of the Kuhgalu {q.v.) f also see under Bahmai, Talyibi I Khadiri and Agha Jari. According to tribal traditions their progenitor was a Behdarvand Bakhtiar, (by name —Agha Ali), who fled from his own country and settled in the Tang-i-Lira, married a Lur girl, by whom he had four sons, from whom are sprung 4 of the present 5 sub-tribes of the Liravi.

He maintained about 30 road guards.—(CAm/c, 1912.)QAS—QAS 65 QASHQAI— For present entry substitute the following :— History. This tribe springs from the great Turkish Khalaj tribe, which settled in Asia Minor during the Middle Ages. At the end of the fourteenth century, when Timur removed the Khalaj from Asia to Central and Eastern Persia, many of them fled and settled in Ears, and were called Qach-qm, i.e., “ those who ran away ” (from 5 r ac^wia^=flee). Another tradition has it that Hulagfi. Khan brought them from Kashgar. In course of time the original band became divided into two parts, because a large section retained the habit of migration. One part kept the Turko man appellation of ‘ Khalach the other was called Qashqai. The Shish- buluki and Farsimadan are the only clans now stated to be ‘ Kbalach ’ in origin. rpj^gre are few records of the history of the Qashqais from the time of their settlement in Ears, after the invasion of Jenghiz Khan, to the end of the eighteenth century, when the “ Turks ” were, according to tradition, a number of nomad units without central organisation. Hasan Khan and his brother Isma’il Khan of the Shahilou (Shamlou) branch are said to have been “ confidential advisers ” of the great Karim Khan, Zend, monarch of Southern Persia in 1760 Jani Khan, son of Isma’il Khan, is credited with having consolidated all clans of the Qashqai, and he acquired the title of llberji, and later of Ilkhdni, besides inheriting the leadership of the Qashqais, while his influence must have been considerable with the Qajar Prince Governors of Ears. His second son Muhammad ’Ali Khan, second IMani, married the daughter of Prince Firman Firma, son of Eath ’Ali Shah, in 1824, and evidently was a power in Ears. After a quarrel with his father-in-law in 1829 (?) he took the whole II (tribe) away with him to the province of Kirman. Minuchehr Khan, Wazir of Ears, sent him to Tehran in 1832, whence he returned only in 1874. His eldest son, who became llbcgi, married a daughter of His Majesty Muhammad Shah, and was given high command ; and his brother- in-law ‘ Prince Mutamid-ud-Dauleh protected the tribal chiefs. Various members ofthe ruling family have at different periods been up in arms against the Government: the third son of the first Ilkhdni was in rebel lion in Qlr and Karzln in 1831, and died in imprisonment at Shiraz the same rear Though the fourth son of the first Ilkhdni, and grand-father of the present generation of Ilkhdnis, died fighting for His Royal Highness Firman Firma at Kirman, Suhrab Khan, his son, got into trouble with the Government towards the end of his life, was taken to Tehran, and Muhammad Quli Khan, third Ilkham, with a large body of tribesmen appeared on the plains of Dashtistan to fight the British army m 1856, but according to Qashqai accounts scorned to serve under a Nun commander- in-chief and deserted. He was known as “The Great/Mam; and under him the Qashqai were a powerful and united tribe. He died in 188o, C394GSBSultan Muhammad Khan, fourth Ilkhani, was a weak ruler, without control : many of the smaller clans were ruined and absorbed by larger branches, and much of the IlkhdnVs power passed to the Ilbegi. Haji Nasrullah Khan, fifth IlJchdrii, who had restored the power to the Ilkhani, and secured a firm hold over the tribe, left one son, whose defici encies and failings made him unfit to succeed his father, and the succession passed to the sons of Darab Khan, brother of Suhrab Khan. Haji Nasrul- Jah’s daughter was married to the present (1912) Quvvam-ul-Mulk—a fact that has given rise to much of the hostility between the Ilkhdni, Saulat-ud- Dauleh and the Quvvam’s adherents. In 1898 the eldest son of Darab Khan, Zergham-ud-Dauleh, succeeded as sixth Ilkhdni : he was a man of fine stature and presence, and popular with the tribesmen, largely because of his leniency, and indifference to the pay ment of revenue. His early death in 1905 may be attributed to over-indul gence. During his life-time his full brother, Saulat-ud-Dauleh, had several times acted as Ilbegi, and for a short period in 1902 replaced him as Ilkhdni. About this period the late Quvvam-ul-Mulk had powerful influence in Ears : Prince Shu a -us-Sultaneh had humiliated him, and patronized Saulat-ud-Dauleh. No sooner had the prince vacated the Governor-Gene ralship (in 1906) than Quvvam-ul-Mulk, left as Acting Governor-General, conferred the llkhdnishi'p of the Qashqais on Zaigham-ud-Dauleh, son of Darab Khan by a peasant wife. Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s supporters included Muhammad ’Ali Khan Kashkull, his brothers, and Ayyaz Kiba Khan, Dara- shuri: with Zaigham were Muhammad Hasan Khan, b ashkull, an enemy of Saulat’s, Agha Kiha Khan, Darashiirl and Karim Khan of the BuirAhmadi. A fight took place near Kudian. Zaigham’s force was routed and he had to flee from Pars. The bitter enmity between the Quvvam, and a section of the Qashqais may be largely ascribed to this incident. Zaigham- ud-Dauleh’s full brother ’Ali Khan is allied by marriage to the Bakhtiari Khans, and Zaigham and Quvvam found protection and support with them. krom 1907-10 Saulat-ud-Dauleh made good his position of authority in the II with remarkable force and success. He acted as his own Ilbegi, and proceeded to acquire by purchase, or seizure, rich properties at Firuzabad, barrashband, Jam, Qir and Karzin, etc. He became the richest magnate in Fars, and attached the large body of ’Amaleh to his own person. His in sistence on full payment of ‘ mdliydt ’ by the tribes, alienated the sympathies of many chiefs of imhs and his dismissal of Kaldntars, who incurred his displeasure, also did him harm. He completely crushed Ahmad Khan, ShishbulukI, father-in-law of Zaigham, who had become a man of importance. By 1910 he had fallen out with a chief supporter—Muhammad ’Ali Khan, Kashkuli and with the powerful Kaldntar of the Darashuri. The II, how ever, recovered its former cohesion and unity under his rule, and, much as he was disliked, he was undoubtedly greatly feared among the Qashqai for the advantages conferred on him by his wealth. The institution of so-called “ Constitutional Government ” had, by 1909, brought chaos into Fars affairs, and nullified the authority of the Governor- General, a situation of which the Qashqais and Saulat-ud-Dauleh were not slow to take advantage. They soon realized that their stiength \a,y in their numbers, and in the opportunities for general arming provided by the arms traffic to Tangistan and ShibkMi ports. In 1909 Saulat-ud-Daulehwith a largeQAS—QAS 67 force menaced Shiraz, partly on the ground that his enemies, the Quvvamis, were reactionaries, and himself desirous of setting up constitutional regime in Shiraz, but more particularly because he refused to allow ’Ala-ud-Dauleh to be sent as Governor-General, The same year he caused the caravan road • V / to Bushire to be diverted to the Firuzabad route, which passes through Qash- qai country, and undertook, for heavy remuneration from merchants, to protect caravans from robbery. In 1910 fresh trouble arose owing to the turbulence of the tribes and of r ^ Saulat, and to the fact that his Bakhtiari enemies were in power in Tehran. Zaigham-ud-Dauleh was sent back to Shiraz to reassume the lead of the tribe, but met with a cold reception from the Qashqais, and had to retire when the Governor-General espoused the cause of Saulat-ud-Dauleh. The llkhCni had in the spring declined orders to undertake responsibility for the “ Imperial ” caravan route via Kazarun, unless certain governorships, i.e., Kazarun and Behbehan, were given to him as appanages. He now in the autumn returned to power, guaranteed the safety of the road, and his nomi nees were posted in Kazarf.n and Behbehan. The FarsTnadan, however, broke loose from restraint on the downward migration, and created great destruction and havoc along a portion of the telegraph wires near Dasht-i- Arjin. The appointment of Nizam-us-Sultaneh as Governor-General of Fars was welcomed by Saulat-ud-Dauleh, whose interests and policy were in many respects similar to those of Nizam. In January 1911, together with Saulat- us-Sultaneh, his younger brother, he took the unusual step of coming to Bushire with several hundred tribesmen to greet the new Governor-General. - He had obliged the Khans of Borazjun, Ahmadi, and other places on the main caravan route to pay him large monetary tribute. Kamarij stood in his way ; and this place w r as coveted by the Kashkuli Khans also, whose winter-quarters march with the Kamarij district. After despatching a force of Qashqais to assist in Nizam’s punishment of Tangistan, the llkhani turned some of his tribesmen on Kamarij, but gained little success. At the end of 1910 he had again undertaken responsibility for the security of the caravan route via Kazarun, and he sent Muhammad ’Ali Khan, Kashkuli, against the Mamassani tribes, authors of extensive robberies on the road. His relations with this Kaldntar were, however, far from cordial. In 1911, realizing that he had many enemies among his chiefs and relatives, Saulat-ud-Dauleh skilfully appointed Saulat-us-Sultaneh, his brother, as Ilbegi, with charge over the internal affairs of the Qashqai : this was to keep his brother from intriguing against himself. At the end of April 1911 occurred the attack on the Quvvam brothers by Nizam-us-Sultaneh, A. * an( l the murder of the younger, in which the tribesmen were implicated, probably with the IlkhdnVs approval. It is undeniable that Saulat- ud-Dauleh had the power, when his pocket was properly compensat ed, and no intrigues were on foot against him, of maintaining order and security on the caravan route, for, apart from his successful guarantees of the Firuzabad and Jirreh routes, he substantially alleviated the position of merchants in Shiraz and Isfahan during the summer of 1911, by undertaking the protection of caravans which passed up by the “ Sarhad ” road through his tribal country to Qumisheh and Isfahan. When, however,AQAS-QAS 68 the tnbes retiirned t° their downward migration in September 1911, Saulat- u -1 auleh supplied a large force of riflemen to carry on Noam’s faction fight n ith Q u vvam-u 1-Mulk s adherents : but the successful irruption of the Khamseh // on behalf of the Quvvam party dealt a severe blow to Saulat- ud-Dauleh s prestige, and he retired to his property at Clwh-i-KazImeh in ^ir and Karzm, taking with him the large Darashuri clan, instead of allow ing them to proceed in the direction of Behbehan as usual. Saulat was removed from the 77M.,m-ship at the same time as Nizam was dismissed from the Governoship of Ears (November 1911), and the Government sent /aigham-ud-Dauleh, with the title of Sardar Ihtisham, to take over the 11- . m '^ u P fEe Qashqai. After the autumn migration of 1911 the execu tive power oyer the clans was wielded by the Ilbexji, Saulat-ud-Sultaneh (now Amir Ashair), who gathered together a number of the more important chiefs of clans at Farashband. qoL 11 J )ecem 1 ber 1911 occurred the attack on Mr. Smart and his escort of the r 9t . h if ntral India Ho _ rse near Kazarfm by the Kashkuli under Muhammad Ah Khan. ^ The llkhdni was too weak to exact reparation, and disruption of the Qashqai tribes became almost complete. Robberies were very frequent. However, early in 1912, Zaigham-ud-Dauleh arrived at Kazarun with a non descript following ; was joined by the Kashkuli Khans, hostile to Saulat- ud-Dauleh, and after a little hesitation most of the chief Kalnntars went over to Zaighaim On April 23rd Zaigham, with a following of about 1,000 tribesmen marched againt Saulat, and though he was joined by the Basirl Arab tribe and a few Government troops with a mountain gun, nothing decisive resulted, as both sides were too careful not to come to blows. Saulat’s following, however, among which was the Darashuri tribe, dispersed, and Saulat fled to Firuzabad. On May 15th all the headmen of the Qashqai tribe came into Shiraz to do homage to the Deputy Governor (Quvvam-ul- Mulk), an unprecedented occurrence. On August 5th, 1912, some adherents of Saulat blocked the road near Shiraz, and severely defeated a detachment of the new Gendarmerie, which was sent against them. There was no force to send against Saulat and the situation deteriorated. In December Zai gham, who had proved quite incapable of controlling the Qashqai, was re placed again by Saulat, on the recommendation of the new Governor General, Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh. On December 12th, occurred the attack on a party of the 39th Central India Horse near Khan-i-Zinian, in which Captam Eckford was killed. The Kashkuli, especially Muhammad ’Ali Khan him self, was said to be implicated in this attack, in addition to Buir Ahmadi and Mamassani. It ia noteworthy that there has been a general deposition for territorial aggrandisement on the part of the ‘ Tirehs 5 living near the caravan route. The Kashkulis in 1909 invaded the coast plain near Daliki to take forcible possession of the Mazara’eh district, and the Kashkuli Khans became Gover nors of Kazarun and the Shapur plain. They were watching every oppor tunity of seizing Kamarij from its present possessor, and their latest move (1912) has been to claim the sub-government of Khisht, and encroach on the Khisht and Kunar Takhteh plain from the Mulla Anar pass and Mehlatun hills. They have allied to them the Dushman Ziari branch of the KfihgalaQAS-QAS 69 tribe, and have brought them as guards on to the upper part of the route near Shiraz : they are also in touch with leaders of the Buir Ahmadi. The Farslmadan, whose camping grounds lie to the east of the Kamarij plain, during the autumns of 1910 and 1911, showed themselves wantonly { and intentionally destructive of telegraph property, between Khan-i-Zinian and Pul-i-Abgineh. Their Kalantars were also trying to seize as personal property villages on the Kazarun plain. | ^ Ethnography. Numbers .—Before the great famine of 1871 the Qashqai were said to number 50,000 tents, but in this year they suffered heavily both by actual famine, and by the dispersion it necessitated. In 1892 their numbers were estimated at 10,000 tents. Wilson says that in 1911, on very good author ity, they numbered 25,000 to 26,000. To this number must be added, some 15.000 families of peasants, some of whom were once Qashqai nomads, but are now sedentary, and inhabit various districts mainly or wholly under Qashqai control. Chick in 1912 said that the actual numbers of the nomad units are about 40.000 tents, or families : their proteges (Bulvardi, etc.), allies, tenantry and cultivators of their lands may make an additional 10,000 families. If we reckon 5 persons to each family or tent, this makes a total of 300,000 tribespeople. The present Ilbegi (1912) estimated that the II numered at least 500,000, while Saulat-ud-Dauleh stated to Mr. Chick that no one knew the exact numbers, and it was not to his interest to find out, on account of the Government poll-tax. (For numbers of fighting men see under Military.) ■ Habitat .—No nomad tribe in Persia travels so far in their migrations as do the Qashqai, whose win ter-quarters (Garmsir) extend to the immediate neighbourhood of Biz, Jam, and Galehdar in the south; their summer- quarters (Sards!r or Sarhad) being in the neighbourhood of Asupas, Arsin- jan, Ardakan and the Chehar and Shlsh Dangeh districts, parallel with, but west of, Yazdikhast, where they come into contact with the Arab tribes. Their most northerly summer camping grounds are in the last two named districts. To the west they extend to within a few miles of Behbehan, this district being visited by the Darrehshuri section (who thus come into con tact with the Kuhgalu), whilst the Kashkull come down to within a few miles of the sea on the borders of the Dashtistan district. They will not be found east of Afzar or the Qir-o-Karzin plain, nor in the neighbourhood of Muba- ^ rakabad or Jahriim, nor in the Kara Aghach valley from Kavar to Tadun, and never south of the mountains bordering the sea coast. In many cases the ‘ lireh ’ in its winter-quarters is divided and settled in distinct portions, far apart from one another. Thus the main body of the Kashkull are settled in the Mehlatun hills, from Khisht to Mishun, but another branch of the Kashkull still proceeds each year to the ‘ Bulak ’ of Qir-o-Karzin. There are Gelleh Zan Namadi between Farrashband and Jirreh: there is another part of this clan in Hangam and Qir. Ja’afarbegl are on the eastern border of the ‘ Buluk ’ of DashtI near Shunbeh, and also with the Ilkhani in Qir-o-Karzin. C394GSBQAS—QAS 70 The following ‘ Buliik ’ are occupied and overrun by the tribe during the winter months :— 6 Farrashband. Beh- Khairabad (near bohan). Mishun and Bldkarz. The Mehlatun (Mailatun). 8hapur. Jin’eh. Tangaram. Sar-mashad and Husain- fibad. Dehrud. Famur. Kuh Marroh. • Dehrain. Hangam. Simakan. Qir-o-Karzin. Laghar and Makhgan. Duzdgah. During their summer migration and residence the following ‘ Buluk ’ are occupied by the tribe KJmnj. Afzar. Calendar. 'Alaruarvdasht. Jabal Anaruyeh. Bldshahr. Asupas. Diz-kurd. Kliusru Shirin. Cheliar Dungeh. Slush Nahiyeh. Hanna. Siraaran. Nukhudan. Pa Danna. Siakh. Baiza. Ramjird. Kam Firuz. Qumeir (Kuh Mihr) and Kakan. , A very large portion of Ears is therefore in the hands of, or connected with, the Qashqais ; and the settled population of those districts, with the men left in charge of land under cultivation by the tribe, form a large addition to the numbers of the actual tribesmen. In many cases the settled vil lagers detest the tribesmen for plunder of the village flocks, oppression, des truction of their crops, and highway robbery. Migration .The nomadic migration takes place twice a year, once up- country and once down, and varies to the extent of very few days. About the vernal equinox, or Nau Buz, (middle of March) they commence to move slowly north : and they leave their northern pastures rather before the mKkUe of September, and come back to their old camping-grounds in the The migrations of the Qashqai differ little from those of other nomad tribes : mules are more used for transport purposes than is the case else where and cattle are not extensively employed. The Qashqai are probablv the only tribe in South Persia, except the Arabs, who use camels for the pur pose. The principal route is that adopted by the Darreh Shuri, Kashkuli, hammadan, and others, who, coming from Behbehan, and the Mahur-i- Mifati district strike the Bushire-Shiraz post road in the neighbourhood of v Bazarun, and follow the general trend of this route as far as Dasht-i-Arjln and Khan-i-Zinian, whence they either proceed via Chanar-i-Rahdar, and cross the Shiraz plain to Guyum and Baiza, or move direct to Ardakan. h rom the latter point they disperse by various routes to their summer quarters On their way down to the plains they follow the same routes. A few tribes use the Tang-i-AUahu Akbar north of Shiraz, but the majority keep Wel110 the west of t]ie town - Tri bes coming from Galehdar, Ala Marvdasht, Afzal, etc., e.g Shish-Buluki and the llkhanis’ followers generally pass through Chanar-i-Rahdar on their wav upcountry. Any deviation from the customary lines of migration is most difficult for the larger tribes, and to block their upward path is not only the easiest, but the most effective way of putting pressure upon any particular tribe, or onf QAS—QAS 71 the tribe as a whole. (The lines of migration of each tribe are given in the table). Customs .—The Qashqai resemble generally the Lur nomads of South- West Persia. Their language is Turkish, though most tribesmen understand Persian fairly well. In appearance they compare favourably with their Lur compatriots : they seem on the whole to be taller and fairer than Bakhtiaris, and certainly more so than Lurs. In religion they seem more orthodox, ♦ and less superstitious than their Lur neighbours ; ’Ali Illahis will not be found among them, and Imamzadehs, Qadamgahs and Pirs are as noticeable by their rarity in Pars, as by their frequency in the Luristan and the Bakh- tiari countries. The Qashqai, in their winter quarters at any rate, do not camp in the open valleys. Their custom is to select secluded valleys and ravines on the hill side, which are to some extent protected from the winter weather, and also near water, and in such spots four, ten, twenty tents may be seen together. The Qashqals are nomadic not only from traditional custom. Their tribal wealth and food-supply depends so largely on their flocks and herds that the necessity of leaving the * hot regions ’ before the grazing in the valleys has been dried up, and of seeking fresh pastures is imperative, while the climate of the “ Sarhad ” is too bitter during the winter months, and more firewood can be obtained in the hills of the “ Garmsir.” Their sheep and goats not only provide milk, meat, and clarified fat, which are staple items of their food, but the wool and hair is used by the tribes for weaving their own tents, coverings and carpets for sale in the towns, from which source each tent derives a portion of its yearly income. In some “ tirehs ” the poorest tribesmen are said to own 300 animals. Sheep too find a large sale among the settled inhabitants of the south during the winter season. Sub-divisions .—It is a well known tradition that the Qashqai were from the beginning 44 ‘ tirehs ’ (branches or clans). Some of these have almost disappeared, and others have dwindled to a few tents. Some ‘ tirehs ’ have been merged into larger branches : in times of stress large bodies of the Qashqai have gone over to the Bakhtiari country, or, in a less degree, to the Khamseh tribes, and become identified with those tribes. Severity on the part of the Ilkhdnis, or partisan jealousies in the ‘tireh ’ itself, are often the cause of secessions. On the other hand many of the ‘ tirehs ’ are to-day composed of elements, in which little of the original Qashqai stock can be traced, and much new blood has been imported. Thus the present leading family of the Kashkuli clan came from the Zend tribe, originating from near Kirmanshah. The Pars tribe called Bulvardi, ' Arab ” tribes like the Nafr, and Kuhgalu Lurs are to be found scattered amongst, and incorporated in the Qashqai. Peasantry from a certain district will attach themselves to the clan frequenting the district, and small sedentary tribes are taken under the patronage of the Qashqai. The original 44 ‘ tirehs ’ have therefore increased, but it is difficult to get an accurate list of all. A list of 57 clans is given by the Fdrsndmeh (History of Pars) written over 30 years ago. In January 1911 Saulat-ud-Dauleh, llkhdni, gave Mr. Chick a list of 47 nomad, or partly nomad clans.QAS-QAS 72 The lists compiled in 1875 under Colonel Ross, and mentioned in 1890 by Lord Curzon, in his book, give comparatively few names, and there is much diversity of spelling. Seden'ary Tribes.—The whole tribe is not migratory ; many sections such as the Abulvardi, (partially nomadic) Surkhi, Ikdir and Kurdshuli, are villagers, moving sometimes into tents in the summer, but never leaving the vicinity of their lands. The non-nomads have largely lost their tribal organization, and are simply known as “tajik” or peasantary. But some, such as the Surkhi and Kuhmarreh tribes maintain a vigorous existence^ and rival the nomadic tribes in the art of brigandage. The principal sedentary tribes are as follows Name. Habitat. Headman, etc. Fami lies. ’Alibeganlu .. Mubarakabad and Qlr in Firuzabad district. Kuchik Beg 250 Abulvardx In villages east of Shi raz, Abulwardi and others. Are principally pedlars, travelling in the adjoining districts. They are a pro - perous community ; have for many years supplied gunners to the Central Gov ernment. They make carpets. Kadkhuda Hu sain ’Ali Beg. 100 Choahar Punjeh ... Ikdir In Siakh ... Kadkhuda Wali Khan, Ki- kha Khan. Some migrate from Simakan to north west Sarhad. 400 Kuhmarreh ..

Kadkhuda Muhammad Sa- diq Khan and Haji Masih Khan: with Kashkuli. 100 Surkhi In villages south of Shi raz. Have only been included amongst the Qashqai in the last few years, but are now an integral part of the tribe. 500 Nomadic Tribes .—Of the nomadic tribes, the Darreh Shuri, {q.v.) Kashkuli (q.v.) Shish Buluki (q.v.) and Farsimadan (q.v.) are the most important, and their support or opposition to an Ilkhcni, is an important factor in Fars politics. Of secondary importance are such tribes as the Gallehzan,75 QAS—QAS Military. Estimates of the fighting strength of the Qashqai differ widely, not only in the matter of numbers, but also in regard to other matters. For instance in 1912 Mr. ( hick said that “ The enormous extent of country occupied by the Qashqais and their distribution in sparse units, widely scattered over extremely mountainous country, not only prevent the tribes from accumulating in any one place in more than a small fraction of their real strength, but also would seem to make any operations against the tribe, % or certain sections of it, an extremely difficult matter.” The same year, however, Lieutenant Wilson reported as follows:—‘For many years the Qashqai have been more or less united under the guidance of a single family : but they have not until the last few years attained political strength, and are easily divided into hostile camps by the dissensions of their chiefs. They are more prosperous than perhaps any other large nomad tribe, and this very fact would make their subjugation by any Government, which exhibited the elementary qualities of purpose and determination, a matter of no great difficulty. Their extensive lands in the high and low country, their large flocks, and the narrow limits within which their lines of migration necessarily run, make them peculiarly vulnerable. Their country is mountainous in places, but not to the same extent as the Bakh- tiari or Kchgalfi country. It is traversed in every direction by roads fit for large bodies of troops, who could be supported without difficulty, on sup plies drawn from the sedentary population, which will be found all over Fars. They have no vast tracts of country abandoned solely to nomads, as have all the other nomadic tribes of South-West Persia. They must perforce -r live amongst a sedentary population, which greatly exceeds that of the tribesmen in point of numbers.” Numbers .—In 1910 Chick estimated that Saulat-ud-Dauleh had 2,000,000 men under his command ; but in 1912 he reckoned the number at 50,000 families (300,000 tribespeople) with 75,000 men capable of bearing arms. This does not represent the number likely to combine in opposition either to a tribal enemy or to an invader. Wilson in 1912 estimated that “ There should be, in theory, about 30,000 fighting men at the Ilkhani's dis posal, and there are as a matter of fact probably not less than 15,000 mo dern rifles in possession of his tribes, and half as many obsolete ones. But no Ilkhdni has ever been able to collect and keep together more than 3,000 men at most. Saulat-ud-Dauleh, acting with the approval and at the request of the Governor General, was unable to keep more than 2,000 men in-the field in support of the Nizam, in spite of the attractive prospe t of the loot * of Shiraz, that he dangled before his men : the season was moreover convenient, and supplies from pillaged villages abundant. The maximum number of men that an influential IlkhF.ni could hope to collect and keep together at a favourable moment, such as, for instance, the month im mediately preceding the migration to or from the plains, is 4,000 men. Such a force could only be retained for a few weeks, and only when plen tiful supplies were available locally.” Figh'ing qualities .—The men are of medium height, light, active, and hardy. They are war-like in their traditions and tastes, good riders and—pm - *- * . - -QAS—QAS 76 accustomed to firearms. The tribe could furnish good infantry men inured to hard work over rough country, and requiring but little transport for their few simple wants. General Gordon describes the horsemen encountered by him in 1892 as “ tough and rough irregulars mounted on small, wiry horses.’! The Qashqal are probably superior to the Bakhtiarl as fighting mem The mere fact that their losses in Shiraz during the autumn of 1911, amount ed to over 400 killed and a proportionate number wounded, proves ♦ that they are not deficient in courage of a sort; but their failure to make an impression on the defences of the part of the town which they were attacking, indicates that they are deficient in other qualities, which are essential to a fighting man. It was noticeable that almost all Qashqai losses were incurred during night attacks ; and the fact that both sides, Qashqal and Arabs, had recourse to mining and countermining is worthy of records Armament .—The Qashqai are well armed, practically every able-bodied man being in possession of a magazine or Martini rifle, and, in 1911, fairly well supplied with ammunition. Saulat-ud-Dauleh was permitted by the Persian Government to import some 200,000 rounds, early in 1911, for the use of his tribesmen in protecting the roads ; all this and a good deal more besides, were expended during the autumn of 1911 at Shiraz. During 1912 there was more fighting among the Qashqai, and about the same time the blockade of the Pars coast was undertaken by the navy, thus curtailing the supply. Though the tribe is rich, and during winter live close to the coast, they must now (1912) find it difficult to maintain an adequate supply of '•f ammunition. In the year 1900 the Qashqal tribe did not possess more than 200 rifles, but in 1912 they had 15,000 magazine rifles, and perhaps 8,000 of older pattern. In 1910 Saulat-ud-Dauleh was presented with a 7 centimetre gun by the Persian Government; but its weight would prevent it being used for any thing but an attack on Shiraz. Administration. The province of Pars is administratively divided into a number of Gov ernorships (Hukumat), Sub-Governorships (Naib-ul-Hukumeh) and districts (Bulfik), of which the last-named are very ill-defined. A large number of these Buluk, and a few Governorships are in the possession of the Qashqal tribe, and whatever settled population there may be in the ^ towns or villages of those districts is under the control of, and entirely at the mercy of, the Qashqai II and its chiefs. During the past few years, under Saulat-ud-Dauleh particularly, there has been a considerable exten sion of power of the Ilkhani and tribes in this direction. In the Garmsir, or Southern Pars, the Qashqal possess the governmental district of Piruz- abad : during 1909, TO and T1 the government of Kazarun was either in the hands of an underling of the Ilkhani, or, as in 1911 with the Kaldntars of the Kashkull section, Mahammad ’Ali Khan, Kashkuli, and others. In 1912 the Kashkulls were turned out of Kazarun. The Qashqal returned one deputy to the Majlis in 1909.QAS-QAS 77 Tribal Rule .—The supreme chief or llkhdni of the whole ' II ’ or collective tribe of the Qashqal, has in the past been appointed as such by the Central and Provincial Governments, and not by the common consent of the tribes men. He is assisted by an “ Ilbegi” At the present day there is little doubt that no appointment could be made effectual unless it were supported by the principal sections of the “II”, and their leaders. Yet on the other hand, these officials, derive their authority with the tribes, mainly from the fact that, as they are responsible for the tribal revenue, they are in a position to bring pressure to bear on all sections of the tribe, with the support when necessary of the Persian Government. Once deprived of the title of Ilkhcni or llbegi no chief can hope to retain his hold on more than a small proportion of the tribes. The Ilkharii and llbegi must come of the descent of the Khans of the Shahilou (Shamlou) clan. For every ‘ tireh ’ of the “ II ” there is a Kaldntar, to whom that clan owes obedience, and who are themselves subject to none save the “ llkhdni ” and llbegi. The appointment of the Kaldntars, their dismissal and reinstate ment is at the will of the llkhdni and llbegi : but in the case of the largest clans the Kaldntars are often so powerful as to be able to defy the llkhdni and to remain aloof in a sort of sullen hostility. In practice, even when dismissed, they maintain their influence in a large measure, though of course they are unable to collect revenue. Revenue .—The “ II ” is assessed in the original ‘ mdlidt ’ at 27,000 tunidns : 30,000 twmaw.? (‘farh’) were added by Farhad Mirza. The sums actually exacted from the Kaldntars of the clans by the llkhdni and llbegi as revenue are, of course, much greater. About 125,000 tunidns was an estimate given. The ’Amaleh, are exempted from ‘ mdlidt ^ in return for their feudal service at all times. Until the year 1907 the Qashqai revenue was paid fairly regularly. In 1911, however, it was estimated that Saulat-ud-Dauleh owed the Central Government 250,000 tunidns on account of revenue. The amount of revenue demanded from the Qaohqal is high as compared with other nomad tribes. Resources. Agricul'ure .—Although their chief wealth lies in the possession of flocks, the Qashqai are of agricultural as well as of pastoral habit. They sow wheat and barley on the summer lands, rice in the low country. They allow the summer lands to lie fallow for one year. In the spring they plough and break up the fallow land, which they again run over with the plough in autumn, and then put in the seed just before the first fall of snow and their migration south. Immediately on arrival at their winter quarters they lay down rice in cer tain places, which they gather before they leave. On their return to the high lands, they find their winter crops well above ground, and as the weather warms, they attend to the irrigation of these. They reap in July and August. In the highlands in the vicinity of Main, fine walnut trees occur ; and excel lent vineyards, carefully tended by Persian (Tajik) peasants, who pay rent C394GSBQAS-QAS '*&amp; to the Qashqai, are a noticeable feature of the Asupas valley. Ra sins are largely made and the grapes are also exported. Horses .—The breed of horses, though strong and serviceable, shews no ^ remarkable quality. They average 14 hands 1 inch in height and are active, hardy, enduring and surefooted. The colts are sold when about three years old, the fillies only being kept. Bell places the price of a good horse at from 200 to 400 rupees. Valuable horses are only bred by the Ilkham and his well-protected relations; for with others, immediately a very good colt is heard of, it is demanded by or for, some one in authority, and a colt or filly is not infrequently fired for some ficticious unsoundness m order to prevent its being claimed. The numbers owned by the tribe were in 1892 estimated at between 6,000 and 7,000, mostly mares. Transport .—Mules and donkeys are also owned and used for transport in the periodical migrations. Camels are not owned in large quantities. Cattle. The fine breed of Qashqai cattle are proverbial, and a hardy breed owned by the Tajiks, generally black in colour, is used both for; the plough and transport. Sheep. Very largeflocks of sheep, and goats are owned. The former are of remarkable size some times weighing as much as 140 lbs. The goats are chiefly black and red in colour. The wool of the sheep and goats is all required for the use of the tribe, who work it up into articles of clothing, camp equipage,, horse coverings, hand carpets.

Some of them live in chappars (reed and grass huts), while others use exclusively the black goat’s hair tent, or bohun as it is -called by the Lurs. Their Chief in 1910 was ’Ali Muhammad Khan.

The tribe is permanently settled in Lindeh and have no yaildq, or summer quarters. v They trade exclusively with Behbehan (via Tangi-Tikau), except for arms and ammunition, which they also obtain, through agents, from Ramuz (via Likak and Bulfaris). The Taiyibi Garmsiri are friendly with the Bahmai and Birir Ahmadi, but on bad terms with the Taiyibi Sarhadi. See also under Kuhgalu.— (Bell ; Ranking, 1910.) TAIYIBI SARHADI— A sub-tribe belonging to the Liravi division of the Kuhgalu, classed among the Pusht-i-Kuh tribes. Like the Bahmai, the Taiyibi trace their descent from Agha 'Ali, Behdar- vand. They are good fighters, but wild and lawless, and arrant thieves. It is this tribe which causes constant trouble on the Lynch Road. They are also considered the best armed and most intelligent of the KOhgaln ^ tribes. In 1910 they were under the command of ’Ali Murad Khan of Kaleh Raisi.

The Sa’adat-i-Shah-Ghalib have their habitat between the Janaki Sardsir and Taiyibi. They trade with Bebehan, which is the receiving market for their stolen goods. The Taiyibi Sarhadi are on friendly terms with the Dushman Ziari and Bal mai, but have a blood-feud on with the Buir Ahmadi. Among them selves, owing to a plurality of Chiefs, each faction is constantly at war with other factions, and politics among them have little or no stability. The communications in their territory are the main route to Behbehan via Tang-i-Band and Tang Tikau, main route Isfahan via Burs. Main route Ramuz via Tang-i-Chavil.

TANGISTAN (District).— For the present entry under Tangistan district substitute the following TANGISTAN District— This district of the Persian coast of Pars is somewhat irregular in shape. Its maximum length from north to south is about 40 miles, and the north ern half has a breadth inland of about 20 miles ; but the # southern half is merely a narrow strip upon the coast. It includes localities formerly separate entities, such as Samal and Ahram, and the Khaviz valley. The last named is the only portion in the mountains, and outside the coast plain. History. At the time of the British war of • 1856, when the Tangistanis put up a brief resistance, their district was in the undivided control of Baghir Khan. For much longer, however, they had been notorious for their inroads into Bushire. After Baghir Khan’s death the district got gradually out of the control of its own chiefs. For a time the famous Muhammad Khan of Dashti ruled it, subsequently Hasan Khar, son of C394 GSBTAN—TAN 82 V y &lt; Baghlr Khan. Haidar Khan, a nephew of the above, was kept a prisoner at Shiraz for many years previous to 1890. After his return, he and his cousin ’Ali Khan ruled alternately, but weakly and badly : and several kadJchudds made themselves practically independent, including a certain TcadUudd of Baghak, Haji Muhammad ’Ali. Mdlidt was not paid, and the Khans, in bad odour with the people, were finally driven out through the Darla Begi’s championship of Zair Khidar, son of the above named Kadkhudd of Baghak. This man originally agreed to act as Kaldntar of the district under the Khans, and got together the mllidt ; but finally dispossessed the Khans. From 1905 onwards Zair Khidar and the various kadkhudcs remained each supreme in his own village or surroundings, the most notable being Hasan Bakshu in Ambarak, Ghulam Husain Haji Khidar in Shuraki, Rais ’Ali in Dilvar. The Khaviz valley and Ahram were farmed by Zair Khidar, who amassed money, but was very lenient. In 1911 Nizam-us-Sultaneh rejected Zair Khidar’s overtures, having with him in his suite some of the younger Tangistani Khans. Zair Khidar was attacked by a force of the Nizam, beaten back to the hills, and his village Shamshiri destroyed. Sharp fighting ensued, in which some of the kadkhudds like Hasan Bakshu, took the part of the Khans. BaghTr Khan, Bahadur-us-Sultaneh was killed, but old Haidar Khan went back to Ahram with the other Khans on Nizam-us-Sultaneh’s behalf. They remained in power as long as Nizam was Governor-General, but in October Zair Khidar attacked them in the fort of Qalat, and, as their supporters melted away, they were forced to fly the district. Muvaq^ar-ud-Dauleh, the new Governor, put Zair Khidar in charge of all Tangistan, in 1912. The other kadkhudds are by no means subordinate to Zair Khidar, though Zair Khidar can raise the most men. Rais ’Ali of Dilvar has become rich, and there fore of some importance, through successful smuggling. In October 1911 the crew of a Tangistan boat committed a piracy near Dibai. The Tangistanis refused to hand over the culprits, or afford repa ration, and the Persian Government failed to compel them to do so. Ac cordingly in June 1913, a couple of His Majesty’s ships blockaded the Tangistan coast, and confiscated the boats belonging to the villages im plicated. In these operations one seaman was killed and five wounded. Geography. The present boundaries of the district are:— West, the Mashileh from near the caravan route to its end, then along the sea-coast to Karri. Sou&lt;h, from this point to the hills behind (which separate it from inland Dashti) and northwards along the crest of these hills to agulley flowing out past Kullul, a little to the north : south of Bagh-i-Abui to the mountains north of the Kuh-i-Bairami. North, from the Mashileh, south of the caravan road, south of Chaghadak, north of ’ Alichangi, then east of Chahkutah, and north-westwards till it meets the Borazjiin border : west of Bulfariz and Gandumriz : then turning eastwards north of Gulungun, along a low range of hills till it reaches the Tang-i-Haft Mulla. Ea t, southwards along the range of coast mountains, past the Kuh-i-Dukhtar to the entrance of the Tang-i-Vahush, then along the range east of the Khaviz valley, south of Muhadu and Ashi. A low range of hills separates the villages on the sea-coast from the rest of Tangistan.TAN—TAN 83 \ 1 % The great maritime range, where it adjoins Tangistan, is of no great ele vation, the highest point being Kuhd-Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, 3,938 feet, a few miles to the north-east of the Tangistan capital of Ahram. A spring of extremely hot water is said to issue from the western face of Kuh-i-Dukhtar, and to be adjoined by deposits of sulphur. An important feature of the district proper is the Ahram stream, which has its exit from the hills on the south side of Khh-i-Dukhtar, and, leaving the town of Ahram on its right bank, runs north-west and joins theChah Kutah stream of the Dashtistan district, a few miles above the point where the latter empties itself into the swamps near Bushire town. A short way below Ahram town this stream has a channel of 100 yards, the right bank being 20 feet high, of a tenacious white clay, while the left bank is lower and more shelving, but the breadth of the actual stream is ordinarily about 30 feet, and its depth 1 foot only : it is believed, however, to be liable to sudden floods after rain in the hills. » The surface of the Tangistan district would be flat and open through out, as it is in its northern part, were it not for the accident of a considerable sandstone range, which, running parallel to the sea at the distance of a mile or two inland, divides the southern portion of the district into an inland valley and a jlittoral tract. These three features, the inland valley, the coastal range, and the maritime strip, are all pro longed southwards into the Dashti dist; ict. The inland valley is cultivated under the hills, and a chain of small villages depending on cultivation extends down each side of it. The coastal range has a length of over 50 miles, and belongs as much to the Dashti district as it does to 'fangistan ; its most general name appears to be that of Kuh-i-Mund, derived from the Mund river, on which its southern extremity abuts, but it is also called Kuh-i-Kar. The most northern point of Kuh-i-Mund, called Ching Kauntar, is only 467 feet high, but at the middle of its length, behind the coast line village of Bu’l-Khair, the range attains a height of 2,682 feet and is here called Bu Baiyal. It is crossed in one or two places by passes leading from the coast to the Tangistan and Khur-muj valley. Where the district is flat the surface is generally an alluvial clay, often covered with good natural grazing, and sometimes cultivated with cereals. Travelling is rendered difficult by mud in wet weather. The water of the Ahram stream is almost undrinkable, and the district water-supply depends everywhere upon wells. The climate and seasons of Tangistan resemble those of Dashti. The Tangistan coast possesses no remarkable features : off the coast the tidal stream is so weak as to be often imperceptible. Population. The population of Tangistan may be roughly estimated at 10,000 souls. The people belong to various tribes of which little is known. Among these are the Darhiru, Darshamal, Jamall, Khazaru, Kutu, and Zandabud, but they are generally mentioned in the aggregate as Tangis- tanis. The inhabitants of Samal and Abad are said to be immigrants, of ancient times, called Zanganeh, from the interior of Persia, and those of Tal Siah are said to be Aghayan from Traq-i-’Ajam. In religion they areTAN—TAN 84 Shi’ahs and they speak the Persian tongue. Notwithstanding their prox imity to Bushire town, they live in a rude and uncivilized state ; blood feuds flourish among them and their name continues to be, in Bushire town, a synonym for lawlessness, brutality, and ignorance. The houses in the villages are mostly huts of date-leaves plastered with mud, but some are built of stone; The former Khan (Haidar Khan) who was driven out by Zair Khidar in 1911 was of Arab origin, belonging to a tribe called Fulad.

Resources^ The district is entirely agricultural and is reckoned highly fertile. The chief crops are wheat, barley and dates, to which may be added water-melons and cucumbers. There is no internal or external trade, unless we reckon a small, uncertain export of dates and of other fruits from the hills, such as pomegranates, grapes, lemons, oranges and citrons, and a more regular export of locally manufactured (jack. No calculation has been made of the transport of the Tangistan district nor any estimate of the livestock. The water-supply is from wells.TAN—TAN 85 Military. The number of tufangchis in Tangistan is altogether perhaps 1,000, but there are so many blood feuds and enmities that it is improbable that more than 300 could be collected together. At the time of Saiyid Murtaza’s introduction of the Tangistanis into Bushire in 1909, 1,000 men were said to have collected, but the number was really much less, and then they were attracted by the prospect of loot. Zair Khidar has a residence at Sham- shni, and a fort at Qalat near Ahram. There is a large amount of arms smuggling carried on by the local head men along the Tangistani coast, and occasionally Tangistani dhows indulge in piracies. During t 1 e last 3 months of 1912 over 1,000 rifles were landed on the Tangistan coast. Administration. Tangistan belongs properly to the Government of Bars, but it is now nomin. lly under the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and he, in his turn, has apparently sublet it to the local Khan who is the de facto The annual payment due from the Khan is said to be 8,500 tumans a year. For 40 years at least the ordinary residence of the ruling family has been at Ahram, but it was originally at a village called Tangistan, whence the name of the district. Tangistan village is said to have lain about 5 miles south of ’ Ali Changi and the remains of it were swept away by a flood in 1905. The town of Ahram is described as a comparatively recent acqui sition of the Khan’s family, so also Khaviz on the Ahram river within the mountains, also Abad, and Samal in the district of Dashtistan ; these were all formerly in the hands of the Mashaikh-ul-Mazkur, whose power fell into decay some years ago. Ahram, the Khaviz Valley and Samal are properties of Nizam-us-Sultaneh, (being farmed for about 6,400 tumans in 1911); but the grant was made by the Government in Tehran, irrespective of the rights of ownership possessed by the Khans of Tangistan themselves in the date gardens of Ahram. In Tangistan there is no pretence of government, and even the rudimentary civil justice, which in other districts is dispensed by the religious authorities, does not exist—a deficiency which is attributed to the backward condition of the people and their intractable character. The Khan, however, bv leasing the villages of the district to their headmen, manages to realize a considerable revenue. The incidence of the land tax is nominally 20 to 60 lerans per harvest on the gdu of cultivation ; on each date-tree an annual impost of 33 cents, is levied ; and a poll-tax also is payable by each male adult at the rate of 20 to 40 krdns.TAS-TUM 87 \ of about 1| miles. Few of the houses have any roofs on, such as have are inhabited by the Sa’adat-i-Tashan. They are mostly square in ground plan, with domed roofs and pointed arches, built of undressed stones mortared together with a substance closely resembling gaeh, (gypsum). No inscriptions are to be found either in the remains of the town itself or in the vicinity nearer than the Tang-i-Band and the Tang-i-Sarvak (Tang -i-Saulak of de Bode). The Tashan lands belong to Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zafar, and Yusuf Khan, Amlr-i-Mujahid, by whom they were let to ’Ali Naki Khan for an annual rental of 3,000 tumdns. These lands are well watered and inhabited by some 200 families, some of whom are Bahmai. The rest go by the name of Sa’adat-i-Tashan. The district is capable of supplying 150 fighting men, of whom, however, only §rds would be armed with rifles, and even those with weapons of rather antiquated pattern. Resources .—The Tashan lands contain bitumen springs, 2 dungs (|rd of total area) of this oil bearing land belongs to ’Ali Naki Khan, while the rest, viz. 4 dungs, belongs to Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zafar, who leased his share of the property to ’Ali Naki Khan for an annual rental of 500 turnons. Large quantities of bitumen are dug up annually and sold in Behbehan, fetching 30 to 40 krdns per maund. The following is an estimate of the property of inhabitants, and of their produce surplus to requirements.— 1.000 Cows; 3.000 maunds of rice ; 2.000 jizza, wool; 4.000 Sheep; 2.000 maunds of wheat; 1.000 jizza goat hair; 1,000 Donkeyes; 1,000 maunds, 500 maunds, linseed; sesame; 100 maunds 500 maunds, ghi; gum Arabic. 50 Horse ; 500 maunds, tobacco.

The Kaldntars or headmen of Zaidan in 1910 were : (a) Mir ’ Abdullah, on behalf of the Sardar Arfa’, ’ (h) Amir Agha-i-Lurzaban (Agha Jari). The total produce of the Zaidan lands was estimated in 1910 to be 3,000 jizza of wool and 1,000 jizza of goats’ hair, and the trade is chiefly with Bandar Dilam, whence the tribesmen get their arms and _amnjunition.
