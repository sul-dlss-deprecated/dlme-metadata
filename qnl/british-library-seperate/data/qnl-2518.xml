The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Officer on the Trucial Coast (Gordon Noel Jackson), the Political Agent in Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crawshaw Galloway until March 1947, Cornelius James Pelly thereafter) and an unnamed British Stores Disposal Officer based at Sharjah. The complaints relate to allegations that the purchase of equipment was secured by two Bahraini merchants in agreement with the Disposal Officer, prior to Shaikh Sultan and others having the opportunity to bid. This in turn led to a dispute over the level of customs duty payable on the sold equipment, which would have to be released from Sharjah for transport to Bahrain. An example of a ‘British Disposal Mission Sales Voucher’, dated 8 April 1947, is included in the file (folio 29).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000bf#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000bf#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
