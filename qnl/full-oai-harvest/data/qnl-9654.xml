The correspondence is from the period 1870-1874 and is principally between various British Government departments and offices connected to the region, and the Turkish Government.The Turkish expedition called into question the sovereignty and jurisdiction of much of the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the coastline and islands of the Gulf. The correspondence contains discussions of these matters and reflects British fears of a loss of their monopoly over the control and security of the Gulf, and a disruption of the treaty relations they maintained with rulers in Bahrein [Bahrain], Guttur [Qatar], the Trucial Coast, Muscat, and Aden.The author quotes extensively from the correspondence and other sources, notes on which are to be found in the margin throughout.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>El Hassa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003da#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
