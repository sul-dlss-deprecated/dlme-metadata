The prioritisation of chronological order over arrangement by subject means that papers relating to particular issues are usually scattered through the file, rather than being kept together as subjects. Office notes are included at the front of the file, and mirror the chronological arrangement of the papers (ff 1B-39).</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence begins on the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written and circled in pencil, in the top-right corner of the recto side of each folio. A second incomplete foliation sequence runs through the first part of the file between folios 2-30; this sequence is also written in pencil, but is not circled and is crossed out. A third incomplete foliation sequence runs through the second part of the file between folios 40-352; again, this sequence is written in pencil, but is not circled. Foliation anomalies: 1A and 1B.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and other papers related to slavery, received by or sent from the Political Agency in Bahrain. The majority of the papers in the file are related to manumission applications (over fifty in total), made by slaves in Bahrain or Muscat. In most instances, the slaves applying for manumission were owned by inhabitants of the towns of the Trucial Coast, and Agency staff in Bahrain make enquiries with the Residency Agent (then 'Abd al-Razzaq Razuqi) in Sharjah to assess the validity of slaves' claims. The replies from the Sharjah Agent, in English and Arabic, are included in the file.Besides manumission applications, the file also includes a small number of other items related to the slave trade, including a Government of Bahrain notice (in English and Arabic) on the proclamation of the Governor-General of India (folio 169); statements of debts and balances of accounts for indebted divers (e.g. folios 175-76, 188-89, 193-94, 248-49); allegations of slave trading in Kalba which incur the displeasure of the Political Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle (folios 264, 270, 292); and an unclaimed manumission certificate (folio 354).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000232#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000232#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000232#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
