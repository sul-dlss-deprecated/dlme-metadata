Kemball continues that, should the gift still be required, he will require the assistance of the Government in Bombay of procuring an approriate gift ('articles of rare European or Indian manufacture or fire arms of the newest invention') since nothing of such value is to be found in Bushire. Kemball finishes by noting that an order from the Imam of Muscat for melons from Bushire has been paid for by the Residency, at a cost of thirty-seven rupees, five annas and two pies.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x000077#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
