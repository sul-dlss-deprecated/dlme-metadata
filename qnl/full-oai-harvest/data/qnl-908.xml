Letters discuss his education at Mayo College, Ajmer in a school for the sons of Indian rulers. The Sultan, Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr ibn Fayṣal] wished him to attend a school suitable for Arabs, partly to improve his Arabic. The American Missionary School in Beirut was considered by British officials but the Sultan felt this was not suitable. Letters discuss a school in Baghdad and necessary arrangements such as the rent of a house.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Education</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00019b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00019b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
