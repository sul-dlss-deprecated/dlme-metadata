He was informed that the ShaiKh was believed to be ill and was invited to lunch, an invitation wnich he accepted* i was told later that he was taken by a member of the Kanoo family to see the Shaikh in his hunting lodge at Mutawa the same afternoon. ^e expected to leave on the morning of the 23rd but was held up until the 2btn owing to the fact that the flying-boat in which he had been allotted a seat was delayed at Cairo. He was greatiy annoyed at this delay and it is believed has spent a large sum of money in telegrams about it. He lunched with me again on the 24th Novemoer. In conversation, as was to be expected, he showed himself a strong partisan of Pakistan, out I was surprised at his inability to see the point of view of the other side* He informed me that he had promised to see that there was no ban on the import of pearls to Karachi, provided cash in payment for thorn was not exported from Pakistan. He has apparently some idea of getting the Hindu pearl merchants at Bombay to settle in Karachi with a view to establishing a pearl market there. I also spoke to him about the ban imposed by the Government of India on the import of Batinah dates but he made no comments* I do not know whether this ban is enforced in Pakistan or not. According to his own statement Cir Keroz Khan’s conversation with the Shaikh was mostly confiTied to the subject of hawking. 3d.
