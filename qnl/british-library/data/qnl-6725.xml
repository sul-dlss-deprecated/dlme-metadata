P 2806/29. The Persian Debt to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. It will 'be remembered that the policy to be adopted by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India m regard to the Persian debt came under consideration in May 1924. The total Persian indebtedness then outstanding was £4,549,200. The history of the various items composing this total is given in the Foreign Office memorandum of Cth May 1924, on P.2271/24 below. It will be seen that, with certain unimportant excep tions, the debt in question was incurred jointly to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, and that, save for an item of £490,000 representing pre-war loans on which interest has consistently been paid, the total was made up of special expenditure during the war which the Persian Government were, broadly speaking, most reluctant to meet. The argument on which they based their reluctance was that the money was in a majority of cases advanced substantially to secure the ends of British policy, and should properly be treated a^. subsidy given for that purpose. 2, As the result of considerable discussion in London and in Tehran, it was finally decided in 1925, with the concurrence of the Governmentsf India, the Secretary of State in Council, the Treasury and the Foreign Office, that the Persian Debt to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India should be reduced to £2,000,000 payable in 25 years. The decision was based on the considerations that there was no reasonable prospect of securing full repayment of her indebtedness by Persia; that there was serious danger that we might find cursives faced with a counterclaim for damages sustained as the result of British operations and British policy in Persian territory during and immediately after the war; and that there was some slightslight hope that a readiness to meet Persia halfway might react favourably on the political relations between her and His Majesty^ Government and the Government of India* Payment of the reduced debt of £2,000,000 was to be made by annuities of £180 000 (to be divided between Indian and Imperial revenues in r-\ x xthe the Proportions £84,630 : £95,370). Interest was to be paid at 7% original ^ Binki fund at 2 ^. The annuity of £180,000 was to absorb the debt of £4,549.200 . £34 000 hitherto being paid ae interest on the pre-war loans was made * up 0 f £490,000. It was further agreed that payment of the first Ind ^\®| n( a n nuity of £180,000 should be deferred until 1926-27, subject to British. continued p aym ent in the meantime of the interest charge of £34,000 J,G,; on the pre-war loan. The Persian Prime Minister and the Persian Government of the day accepted an undertaking on these lines, subject however, to ratification by the Majlis. 3 # Despite constant pressure in the subsequent two years, Majlis ratification has never been obtained for the settlement, and the annuities of £180,000 payable under the settlement have not in fact been paid (interest at the yearly rate of £34,000 has, however as before the settlement, continued to be paid on the pre-war loan of £490,000). When in the early part of 1928 comprehensive negotia tions were initiated with Persia, His Majesty’s Government and the Goemment of India, who were both interested in obtaining satisfac tory settlements of a number of questions, such as the posit. o»i of their nationals in Persia on the abolition of the Persian Capitulations; the Persian Tariff; the situation in the Gulf (including Bahrein); the Duzdap Railway; the air route telegraphs and also in the counteracting of Soviet influence in Persia, found themselves with very little with which to bargain. In tnese circumstances, the possible abandonment of the whoj.6 debt.(D debt , if in the course of the negotiations this mightturn the scale, was raised by the Foreign Office. The Chancellor of the Ey'&amp;iequer was not prepared to give way, and expressed the opinion that our only policy was to keep alive the claim and to take every possible opportunity to try and secure a settlement of it. 4. The Government of India, on the other hand, remarked that it was, in their view, worth some pecuniary sacrifice 'to secure a good underabanding all round with Persia, and in particular a satisfactory settlement of the questions of Duzdap tariff, capitulations and the air route'.' They added that they had long since come to regard their share of the reduced debt of £2,000,000 as a doubtful asset, and while remarking that they would be ready to fall in with any final decision in this regard of His Majesty's Government, they were a little doubtful whether total extinction of the debt was really called for. In these circumstances, they suggested that we should not go beyond an offer in the first instance favourably to consider scaling down the debt, say to the figure quoted by the present Shah when Prime Minister - £1,088,000 - and in the last resort extinguishing everything connected with the war and its aftermath, and demanding merely the repayment of the pre-war loan of £490,000 t which stood clearly on a different footing, Lof'd Birkenhead at the time expressed his entire concurrence in the view of the Government of India, and suggested to the Foreign Office that Sir Austen Chamberlain might be willing to press the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider his decision to the extent of agreeing to action on the lines which the Government of India had suggested. The Chancellor,however was not prepared to modify his attitude. 5. Matters remained at this stage through the remainder of 1928. The first stage of the main Persian negotiations ended in May 1928 with the conclusion of a Treaty recognising PersianPersian taiiff autonomy, and a number of connected instruments securing inter alia, on the abolition of the Persian Capitula tions, the personal position of British and Indian subjects in Persia. An arrangement was also reached in regard to the London Karachi Air Route along the S.Persian Coast. The second stage of the negotiations opened in November of this year. 6. In the second stage of the negotiations, which deal primarily with our position in the Persian Gulf, with Iraqi- Persian relations, with the Duzdap Railway, with the conclusion of treaties of friendship and non-aggression, with telegraph questions of great interest to the Government of India and with the question of the debt, His Majesty’s Government ? nd the Govemment of India found themselves obliged in the first place to decide their policy as regards the debt itself, and in the second to discover if possible some bargaining counter which could be offset against the claims, in some cases unreasonable, but in others well founded but inconvenient, made by Persia in connection with the Persian Gulf. The whole field was surveyed by a special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which the Secretary of State for India was a member. Sir Denys Bray was specially deputed by the Government of India to express their views on the position generally. 7. The Sub-Committee came to the x conclusion that it was of great importance, in the interests alike of India and of Great Britain, to add to the number of bargaining counters so far as possible; that the most important single item was probably the Persian debt; that the prospect of securing repayment of that debt was in any event so far as could be judged, relatively small, and that in these circumstances it would be desirable to instruct His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran that in return for a really satisfactory comprehensive settlement, but on that condition© condition only, His Majesty* s Government might eventually be prepared to consider favourably the remission 6f apart, or even of the whole, of the debt contracted by Persia, during and after the war. The £490,000 of pre-war debt was recognised as being in a wholly different position and no question arose of abandoning it. The amount of which the Committee favoured abandonment was £1,510,000 approximately, half of which belonged to India and half to Imperial revenues. 8. The Secretary of State indicated agreement with the view taken by the Committee. As the result of discussion of their report in the Cabinet, the Chancellor of the Exchequer withdrew his opposition to the relinquishment, in the circumstances described tn the previous paragraph, of the British moiety of the £1,510,000. The Government of India, as shown above, have through out been willing to abandon their moiety, Pinal instructions as to using the debt in negotiation have not yet been sent to the Minister, who has however been infomed of the Cabinet decision. After consultation with His Majesty*s Government Sir R.Clive quite recently sent a reminder to the Persian Government of the existence of the debt agreement of 1925-6 and enquired what their proposals were for the repayment of the debt. The reply sent to Sir Robert Clive by the Persian Minister of the Court ran as follows:- 'I neither contest nor confirm recognition of the debt by Pirughi, whose engagement, however, in order to be binding, -al required the approval of the Majlis. My persor/view is that, except for the £490,000 pre-war debt, the remainder should rather be added to the list of war expenses than debited to the account of the Persian Government. I intended to raise the question towards the end of our negotiations^ when we should have more or less reached a solution of various questions. If it happened that in other matters the British Government was to compensate the Persian Government, the double operation of paying and being paid might be avoided”.
