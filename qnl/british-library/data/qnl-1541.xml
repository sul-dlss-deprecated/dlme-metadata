SECRET SERIES. [July 29.] Section 1. [28300] No. 1 Memorandum communicated to the Turkish A mbassador, July 29, 1911. (Confidential.) . , HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to give their caretul attention to tire important proposals contained in the memorandum of the 1st March last fiom t e Ottoman Government. . , . These proposals, though they affect interests so closely interwoven that they cannot be settled independently the one of the other, have, for the purpose of convenience, been set forth under three distinct headings : (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. . . . (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. . , (iii.) An increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem m the lurkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. On various occasions His Majesty’s Government have indicated the conditions under which they would favour the participation of British capital in this enter pi ise , and while it is not now proposed to recapitulate the earlier stages of this question, it may be recalled that in July 1910, as a result of prolonged discussions with the Ottoman Minister of Finance who was then in London, it was intimated that an arrangement securing to British interests a representation of 55 per cent, ot the whole in regard to the Gulf sections of the line might be regarded as a satisfactory solution,—and, having regard to the great preponderance of certain interests m other sections of the line, such a proportion cannot well be looked upon as excessive, especially if the great extent of British trade in those regions and the vast tonnage of British shipping are borne in mind. Since the arrangement laid before Djavid Bey represented a large measure of concession on the part of His Majesty’s Government, they have received the suggestions now made by the Ottoman Government with some surprise. The Turkish proposals for the final portions of the railway are that a new company should be formed, and that the capital should be divided between the Ottoman Government, who would receive 40 per cent, of the whole and British, French, and German groups, who would each receive 20 per cent. The details of the financial arrangements are left for subsequent settlement between the parties i^eiHif Majesty's Government regret that they are unable to accept these proposals. If a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south of Bagdad, and if it is to be constituted upon an international basis, His Majesty » Government can only accede to such an arrangement provided that British mtei ests are represented in a degree at least equal to that of any other Power including Turkey and, in order to effect this and with a view to emphasising the international and commercial character of the undertaking, they would suggest that, Russia should be admitted to participation and that the percentage allotted to each country should ^ ^Assuming that this distribution is adopted, His Majesty’s Government consider that a Convention should be concluded by the Powers concerned P^dmg lor the exclusion of differential rates on any railways m Asiatic Turkey and for equality of treatment in regard to transport facilities and cogna e ma eis_, or , ' of the railway south of Bagdad and the conditions under which it is to be constructed , for the introduction of approved financial arrangements tending to foster the develop ment of traffic ; and for guaranteeing that the interest m the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall be of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. [2123 f—1]It would furthermore be necessary for the Ottoman Government to imdertake formally not to impose river dues on British shipping or cargoes without the assent of His Majesty’s Government. . . , ,, c , ,, , There remains the question of the terminal port: having regard to the fact that important commercial interests are already established at Bussorah, His Majesty s_ Government cannot but feel that substantial advantages would accrue from the, V establishment of the terminus at that point; and they consider that the port should be constructed and controlled by the proposed new company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. But if such an arrangement is adopted, they must stipulate that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the 1 ersian Gulf it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled b;y agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and a clause to this effect must be embodied in a convention dealing with these matters. (ii.) The respective Interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Region of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are willing to meet the wish expressed in the concluding paragraphs of the Turkish memorandum that a precise definition may be reached as to the respective position of the two countries, commercially and politically, in the Persian Gulf; and they see no reason why a lasting settlement of the questions involved should not be reached. His Majesty’s Government are in no sense opposed to the legitimate claims of the Turkish Government. The most southerly point to which they have ever recognised such claims on the littoral of the Persian Gulf is Ojeir, in the district of El Katif. South of this point there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; in 1870 the Ottoman Minister foi Foieign Affairs conveyed to Her Majesty’s Ambassador formal assurances that the Sublime Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf ; and it is only since that date that certain attempts have been made by the Ottoman Government to establish mudirates and other emblems of Turkish authority at points to the south of Ojeir. The position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to these tribes has been entirely different. With Bahrein they have had direct relations since 1805 , these relations have found concrete expression in a series of treaties dating from 1820, and having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the slave trade ; the regularity of the succession to the throne ; the protection of the island against foreign aggression ; and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre. In Muscat and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs His Majesty’s Government have, in virtue of various treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits for many years ; and their policy in each case has been inspired by the importance of upholding the maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce of ^ all countries, and of protecting the long-established interests of British-Indian subjects. His Majesty’s Government cannot acquiesce in any arrangement which might restrict or undermine the authority which they have exercised uninterruptedly with such beneficent results; they conceive that any extension of Turkish jurisdiction along the littoral of the Persian Gulf, to the south of Ojeir would be prejudicial to those results and unsupported by any legitimate claims of Turkish sovereignty ; and they have accordingly resisted any attempts which have been made to encroach upon these regions. They are therefore of opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Govern ment of Bahrein and adjacent islands and of the whole of the Peninsula of El Katr (including El Bidaa), where the Sheikh of Bahrein has important rights; and they consider that such a settlement would finally remove a perennial source of local friction. The Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations of Koweit towards the Ottoman Empire, and His Majesty’s Government will gladly contribute to such a solution, on the understanding that their rights and claims are not to be regarded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward, should such proposals prove abortive. As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government have never admitted that Koweit is under Turkish protection, and, inasmuch as some divergence of opinion was manifested between the two Governments as to the position there, a modus vivendi was reached in September 1901 by His Majesty’s Government consent ing to give an assurance that, provided the Turkish Government abstained from3 sending troops to Koweit and respected tlie status quo there, they would not occupy that place or establish a British protectorate over it. British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not ^consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised ; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the coniines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty. Certain difficulties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage of the Shat-el- Arab. For a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government have some difficulty in appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements ; but, being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation, they would propose to the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small riverain commission, composed of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, the Turkish Govern ment, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b) to police its waters ; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. (iii.) The Increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish Customs Duties. His Majesty’s Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs duties unless a previous and satisfactory settlement had been reached in regard to the Bagdad Railway question. To this attitude they adhere ; and while they consider that such a settlement might be promoted on the lines of an agreement such as has already been indicated, they could not regard a settlement confined to the railway as either satisfactory or complete, since it would leave in a state of uncertainty a number of questions closely affecting British interests in the regions of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are in principle favourable to railway construction in Turkey; but they cannot directly contribute to the completion of the Bagdad Railway if it is to introduce a further element of possible disturbance into an aiea where British rights and interests have, especially of late, been wantonly assailed ; nor do they feel that they could justify to British public opinion the imposition of a tax which will affect British trade,—amounting in Mesopotamia to some 60 pel cent, of the whole,—unless they have provided for a general settlement of political issues m the Persian Gulf, such as the Ottoman Government themselves desire to bung about, and unless they have obtained some compensation lor and a guarantee against the con tinuance of arbitrary acts such as the demolition, on no adequate pretext, of Butish property in Bagdad. . . If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotiation on these lines, and to concur, as already stipulated, in a removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt,—a measure which is called for in the interests of financial reform in Egypt,-—His Majesty’s Government will make it their first aim to con tribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes of friction between the twoPowers; and they will not only consent, subject to *e »ncurreMe „t o4er Pewm •ind to the due observance of such agreement to the further increase o the Turkish customs for a fixed period, but they will likewise agree to the continued levy of the 3 per cent, customs increase, which had only been sanctioned provisionally till the year 1914.

The letter is of interest as it quotes in detail the Vali of Basrah's telegram referred to by Captain Shake spear in paragraph 3 of his letter No. C.52 dated 3rd August 1910, p.nd it is in the latter connection that the Shaikh furmtnes usOffice of tlie Inepector of Registration. Letter No.7. To The Superintendent of Registration, BaeraJi. The date grove \Vhich the KainnaakaTi of Koweit, Muharak es Suhah, Pasha, wishes to purchase from the notables of Basrah (viz) the Al-Zoheir, necessitated an enquiry. An enquiry was made by the Ministry of Interior and a reply war received from the succeeding Vali; and the telegrams and Memorandum received from the Ministry of War contained certain remarks which spoke for themselves. The telegram stated that the date grove which ITUbarak-es-Subah, Pasha, wishes to purchase and Which he wishes to register in the name of his four sons, comprises seven thousand seven hundred and twenty four Donums and its value is forty eight thousand odd Turkish Liras; that the greater part of the value has been paid and the aforesaid Mubarak Pasha wishes to register his four sons in -ohe Roll of registered individuals, and wishes, after taking out Turkish passports, to settle the registra tion in their favour, before the formalities for the enlist ment of his two sons in the Army are observed. For this reason, it is not desirable to delay the registra tion and in view of the reports received the postponement andand delay of the registration are inadvisable, and compliance with the request of Mub ar a &lt;- a»- Sub ah will lead to enhance his sincerity and friendliness. This is what we understand, and the tone of the communications received is favourable to this (course) and it is desirable that compliance should be made in due time. If the said parties are registered in the Roll of registered individuals and took out Turkish passports and if two of them underwent enlistment, you should execute the registration of the date grove in the names of his sons. An authority has been given by the Tfinistry of Interior according to their communication and to the proceedings of the special committee of deputies ('.tfiich was formed) in connection with this.

As you met the Shaikh at Kohammerah in person no answer is required to the query addressed to me in Captain Croath- waite's endorsement So.2659 ixibt dated the 4th October 1910, to which I have not been able to reply earlier owing to the Shaikh's absence from Kuwait. 3. Since his return, however, I have discussed the subject with the Shaikh and it appears that subsequent to his meet ing with you and after the despatch of your telegram of the of Turkish soldiers being posted in the gardens^ and all { shipments stopped. The Shaikh tells me that he then again sent his Secretary to the new vali pointing out the injustice of the procedure in view of the fact known to all that the property really belonged to Shaikh Mubarak, that he was ready to pay the revenue due and indeed that though prepared to do so for a long time, the offer had been declined by the Turkish authorities. Finally, the Shaikh informs me, the revenuewas actually accepted and a receipt passed for the amount citing that the 'revenue for the Fadaghia property standing in the name of Ayesha Khanum had 'been received from the hand of Abdul Azia bin. Salim bin Badr”. The Shaikh seemed pleased with this subterfuge and said that the attachment was then immediately removed by order of the tali* 4, It was of very urgent importance that the attachment j should be raised as early as possible and the Shaikh may have cause for self-congratulation in having effected it by his own unaided efforts; but it is impossible to avoid the | reflection that, as a solution of a very important question involving ultimately the whole status of Kuwait, it is an exceedingly poor substitute for the recognition of 'Kuwaiti' as a distinct nationality, distinct that is to say from furkisl The difficulty has been tided over for the present, but the Shaikh is still left exposed to the machinations of the Turkish officials at Basrah and is still unrecognised official- ly as the ri^itful owner of the property. 5, In submitting this report, I have the honour to solicit your utmost support in recommending to His Majesty’s Govern ment that no really permanent solution of the difficulty is possible until at least the recognition of 'Kuwaiti' as a distinct and separate nationality has been obtained from the Turkish Government. The Shaikh again expressed his faith and reliance on British support, but considering his age and the extent to which his patience has already been tried in this far-reaching matter and one which at present also so closely affects his pocket, it is, in my humble opinion, one deserving of the most urgent consideration, if His Majesty's | Government still attaches importance to the maintenance of our special position in Kuwait and to the possibilities of the port,both commercially and strategically,in the near future I have, etc., Si/- W.H.I.

I HAVE received your despatch No. 289 of the 27th ultimo, forwarding certain confidential correspondence on the subject of the chfficulties experienced by the Sheikh of Koweit in connection with the transfer of his property at Fadaghia. In the course of this correspondence His Majesty’s agent at Koweit brings forward the suggestion that the recognition by the ’Turkish authorities of Ivoweit as a distinct nationality would go far towards a permanent settlement of the present as well as the larger question of the whole status of Koweit. ’ , This suggestion appears to me to be one that would never be accepted by tne present Ottoman Government, with its chauvinistic tendencies. Last year, when the more moderate-minded Hilmi Pasha was Grand Vizier, he found it impossible even to accept the suggestion made by this embassy that Mubarak-es-Sabah or his son should be registered on the “tapu” as “inhabitants of Koweit.” A proposal to admit the existence of Koweit as a separate nationality would consequently be still more obnoxious to the Sublime Porte.

[ question in connection with his properties on the Shatt-al-Arab had been solved in the past. 2. The present position is recapitulated by Captain Shakespear in the concluding paragraph of his report, and it will be remarked that in the last temsialia transaction put through - the transfer of part of the Mutawiah property from Hamid-al-Khalid to the Sheikh - Nationality Certificates were insisted on, and the difficulty got over by the accept ance of such certificates by one wife and two concubines of Shaikh Mubarak.3. The attitude assumed by the Turkish authorities in this case and in respect of the Fadaghia transaction, is not compatible with the position claimed by Mr. Crow and accepted by Wali Suliman Naaif Bey's predecessor, as set forth in the papers quoted in my telegram of 2nd instant, but in existing circornstances the settlement of the difficulty by the regis tration of the property in the names of the same three ladies, or the shaikh’s blind son, seems the simplest solution;though tne fact that the formal good offices of His Majesty's Embassy should take the form of such a suggestion seems to me to bear a somewhat inconvenient aspect in reference to our attitude upon the question of the status of Eoweit, - an aspect which the Shaikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah may not impossibly regard as indicative of a change of policy on our part. For this reason, shouldjzhe solution of the Fadaghia question assume the above shape, I venture to advise that,in order to maintain a consistent attitude locally, we inform Shaikh Mubarak that we learn that the Porte are inclined to compromise with him on those lines, and that as his financial interests are so strongly concerned, we do not propose to complicate matters by raising any objections.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to the Government of India's telegram Bo. 482-S., dated the 21st August 1910, a copy of which was forwarded to me under your Second Assistant's endorsement, Bo. 2273, dated the 23rd August 1910. 2. On my return to Koweit I brought up the subject of his properties on the Shatt-al-Arab in two interviews with the Shaikh. Shaikh Mubarak tells me that originally there were 5 properties named respectively Xutizain, Gherdilan, Ajerawiya, Fao and Sufieh in the joint possession of the Suhah family, and a small one Parhaniya (also known as Dowasir) which has been Mubarak's in his own separate The first five were re-distributed right from a very long time.re-distributed as the result of the agreement come to between Shaikh Mubarak and his nephews in September 1903, a copy of which is already on the Residency records. As a result of this agreement Mubarak gave up his interest in the other four estates for the exclusive right to ?ao, retaining of course the small separate one of Rarhaniya which was already his own. Thus we have now only to deal with the Fao estate, the Farhaniya estate and the gardens subsequently purchased. 3. Both the Fao and Sxxh Farhaniya estates were in herited and as regards them no demand has ever been made for registration in the ’’Tapu' Office books and they have never been so registered. The Shaikh says h|s title to these two consists of documents from his fore-fathers of the nature of testamentary, gift or mutual agreement deeds. 4. From the end of 1907 to beginning of 19C9 he pur chased what is now described as the Mutawiah property from Shaikh Sadun of the Mutifich and Abdur Rahman Beg, his brother. The property consisted of two main division^ known as Shaleh and Hisan but the vendors owned portions in each division. Shaikh Mubarak purchased first Abdur Rahman's land directly from him, and, no difficulties being mademade by the Turkish authorities as to Nationality Cer- tifioates, had it registered at once in the 'Tapu' Office books in the names of his four sons. For various reasons he did not wish to purchase direct from Shaikh Sadun and therefore, though he provided the money, the sale-deed was drawn in the name of Hamid-al-Xhalid and the transfer effected to this man's name in the 'Tapu' Office. This is the same man who was reported by my predecessor as forced to take out a Turkish Nationality certificate to protect himself in his trade-dealings in Basrah. Some time subsequently the Shaikh saw no use in leaving this land in Hamid-al-Xhalid's name and therefore had fresh sale-deeds made out authenticating a sale from Hamid to himself and had the transfer duly registered in the 'Tapu” Office books in the names of three of his women-kind (one being the mother of Shaikh Jabir and the other two | concubines). On this occasion, which,I am now told, occurred some time last year, the authorities insisted on ; Nationality certificates and accordingly these documents were taken out for the three women. 5. There remains only the Fadaghia property which consists of portions named Al-Kharam, Al-Bashiya, and FadaghiaFadaghia, 'but the whole is now always called Fadaghia. This property was purchased from Ahmed Pasha az-Zuhair’s family and four sale-deeds were executed, all of which were witnessed by most of the notables in Basrah. It was a condition cited in these deeds that the transfer in the 'Tapu” Office books should be carried out by the vendor party, the vendee paying all expenses. It is in this case that the Turkish authorities are obstructive by demanding that this property must be registered in the names of the Shaikh's four sons and that they shall all take out Turkish Nationality certificates. 6. To recapitulate, the Shaikh's properties now consist of (a) The Fao and Farhaniya estates acquired by in heritance and not registered in the '’Tapu' Office. (b) The Mutawiah property of Shaleh and Hisan acquired by purchase in 1907-08 and duly regis tered in the ’'Tapu’’ Office partly in the names of the Shaikh's four sons, who did not take out Nationality certificates, and partly in the names of three of his women for whom Nationality certificates were taken out some time last year. {cj The Fadaghiya estates acquired by purchase in 1903-09 and as yet not registered owing to Turkish Official^ insisting that Shaikh’s four sons should take out Nationality papers and the transfer be made to their names.-(Received September 12.)

WITH reference to your telegram No. 265 of tbe 7th September, 1910, and to my telegram No. 190 of the 12th September, I have the honour to point out that there are two separate questions concerning the property of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Caza of Fao. 1. A question about some land near the fort at Fao, which had belonged to the sheikh for some time. There was a dispute between the sheikh and the Turks, who washed to destroy an embankment raised by the sheikh near the fort. This dispute was amicably settled, as reported in my despatch No. 170 of the 10th March, 1909. My telegram No. 190 referred to this question. 2. The question of the acquisition by the sheikh of some date gardens at Fedaghia, in the Caza of Fao, to which the first part of my despatch No. 196, of the 28th May, 1909, referred. I have just received a telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, saying that the question of this registration is apparently still at a standstill, and there is nothing fresh to report since his despatch No. 34, sent to you in my despatch No. 460 of the 6th July of this year.

Later news is to the effect that the Shaikh has alluded to these reports in conversation. He corroborates the first rumour but claims to have replied to the Wali that his own local affairs occupied his time fully and that he had no desire to extend his responsibilities. With regard to the second report, Shaikh Mubarak expressed the view that there was nothing in it ; he thought it was only the Wali letting his tongue run away with him as he is in the habit of doing. 3. I may mention that it is now reported from two or three different sources that the present Wali, Sulaiman Najif Bey, is about to be transferred to Mosul or Aleppo. G. C. B. P.

The ’-haikh said he had recently Bent hia Secretary Abdul Aziz bin Salim to Basrah at Ahmad Pasha az-Suhalr’s request and on his return a day or two ago he related the following account of what passed during his visit. Abdul Aziz met Ahmad ^sha first and the latter after some preliminaries admitted that the Vali had instigated him to impugn (ubarak’s title to the fadnghia property. Ahmad ;-aohr had himself remonstrated with tha Vali, point ing out the absurdity of repudiating tha sal© in the facerace of the aale-deeda held by i ubarak, whioh bore, beoidea his own signature, those of all the B&amp;ar&amp;h notables as R0 that of the British Oonsul. Ho also objected to oomnroiftleing his own f^ood natae in what from his own side would be a thoroughly bad oaae. RoweTer, the Yali offered to send the Turkish ^nn-boat 'I'annsriB* to eject ubarak's n«n from the Fada^hia gardens by force If they should refuse a hint to leave quljt^ly. In short, the whole of the story already detailed was confirmed categorically by Ahmad Pasha himself aa having been sup^ested by the Yali who promised his utmost support. Ahmad Pasha apparently valued hi a om reputation too much to fall in with the Vali*s suggestions, and told the Shaikh's feoretnry he would have no hand in any such ignoble scheme. The ’haikh appears to be thoroughly satisfied with the assurance and remarked that he no longer feared Ahmad Pasha making any difficulties over the K&amp;daghia property. 3. rxxbsoquently Abdul Asia saw the Yali, who appears to have opened the interview with a general complaint against Mubarak for putting him In a false position with his superiors in the Turkish Oovanunant. On Abdul Asia's enquiring how this could be the Yali said he had telegraphed toto Conetrmtinople that : ubarak had a^reod to the /adacrhla property boinp reRisterod In the muttes of Mo four sons, who would all take out Turkish Rationality certificates and moreover that trro of them would enter the Turkish Army I Abdul Asia then appears to have taken the Veil rather severely to task pointing out that he, though himself a Turk and so not likely to minimise any of Mubarak's acknowledgments, was also the haikh'e inter* preter (for Turkish) and his Secretary and he never remembered Mubarak ever admitting: either verbally or in writing anything which could by my etretch of imagination be construed Into the substance of this telegram. The conversation was a long one of much to the same effeot and seems to have been not without ©ffeot on the Vali, who as the Shaikh graphically described it'* had no word and became completely silent”. subsequently the v&amp;li appears to have Ala cub wed with Abdul Asi* the agreement between the Turkish and British •lovemmonts for the maintenance of the 'status quo' in Kuwait, alleging that the British Ambassador in Constantinople was always urging this plea upon the Turkish Government In any little matter which came up between Kuwait and Basrah whilst the British representative in Kuwait who must bo aware of Mubarak's raid upon Kobeir madera&amp;d© no effort to prarant or dissuade him from hwrrying Turkish subjects. I m inclined to credit the truth of moot of the above for the Shaikh was mrtioulsrly frank and seemed considerably le SS anxious than he has been for some time. The conversation described in the loot paragraph above would aeem to point to acme strictures having been passed on Suliman hathif Bey by the Turkish Covorament whether at the instance of Hia luajeaty's Ambassador or not I am of course not in a position to conjecture. The Shaikh told roe some little time n#o that he had news from Baghdad that l-ullman Sathif Bey was to bo transferred from Baerfth.bainc' replaced by Fakhri Pasha from Aleppo, and he sincerely hoped the news would prove true, a letter which I received from t*^ olitioal Resident at Baghdad confirmed this rumour, though the latest nows from Basrah states that the Veil has given the lie to the report which first reached Basrah in a Baghdad newspapor. 5. Cn the soore of workable relations between the -haihh and the Basrah authorities, it Is to b® hoped that Suliaum Kathif Bey wil3 bo moved shortly; for, though his energy in making improvementa in the Basrah roads and in apprehending vagabonds or bad characters may be laudable, his methods in1* deal * n e with powerfvil oMefa likes the Shaikhs of Kuwait eaul Kohaiamsrsh oertaialy appear to lack tact, eavoir falre and appreoiatior. of their position and will almost as certainly load to trouble both for Turkish officials and ouraelvoa, if he is permitted to pursue his present irresponsible course.

Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to invite a referenee to the correspondence ending (\\2ql0 with my letter No. C.-40 of the 30th June 1910, regarding Shaikh Mubarak’s //y Fadaghia property, and to forward herewith a letter with enclosures to your address from the Shaikh. 2. Yesterday evening, the Shaikh requested that I would come and see him as he had received some important news. On arrival, he had read to me a letter from his Basrah Agent as well as some other secret news to the same effect, one letter being from a man whom I know to be one of the most influential men in Basrah and whose name he begged me to keep absolutely secret. 3. As will be apparent from the Shaikh’s letter and enclosures, there is reason to believe that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair (who has just returned from Constantinople) is likely to question the sale of the Fadaghia property either on account of inaccurate measurement or inadequate price. Whatever pretext may be used, it seems fairly certain that some method of re-opening the question of the original sale is to be employed, and Shaikh Mubarak will then find himself in the position, already foreseen, of being unable to appear in a Turkish Court of law to uphold his just rights, while the courts or the “ Tapu ” office have the legal power to declare Ahmad Pasha as owner and to give him possession. 4. The Shaikh himself thinks that the course, which Ahmad Pasha is re&gt; ported to be contemplating, must undoubtedly have the support of the Vali, if it was not actually suggested by him, in order to force Mubarak into accepting Turkish nationality. Abdul Wahab el Kertas was Ahmad Pasha’s attorney in the sale to Mubarak and the latter then forgave him a debt of ^T.a^oo in return for his good offices as broker, but Abdul Wahab still owes the Shaikh a consider able sum. The Shaikh considers he is no longer to be trusted and that he is quite capable of posing as the friend in need of either party, being governed in his choice solely by the amount he is likely to receive for his services. Ahmad Pasha, if he has the covert support of the Vali, is hardly likely to resist the temptation of bleeding Mubarak, or, if he objects to that process, of prosecuting a claim for the property, worth it must be remembered some ^50,000. The preposterous nature of his reported proposal to consider the sale void and to return to Mubarak the purchase price in to years gives an idea of what is con templated when it is noted that Mubarak has already long since paid over the full price, been in possession a year and a half, and spent considerable sums in improvements, drainage, buildings, planting, etc., on the property. 5. From other secret letters the Shaikh showed me, it appears that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair, Yusuf al Mandil and Sayid Talib (son of the Nakib) have realized that by misrepresenting matters to the Vali so as to damage Mubarak they have a very good opportunity of keeping themselves in funds at Mubarak’s expense. 1 hese are three of the most influential men in Basrah, two being Parliamentary representatives, and as the Shaikh truly said, the Vali, 11mmmmmmmmmrnm 2 who is already inclined to credit Mubarak with intriguing with the English, is almost certain to accept the dicta of such prominent men, however impro bable the story may be. The enclosures to the Shaikh’s letter contain evidence that these three men may be acting in concert, both in the matter of delaying or preventing registration of his property, and also in poisoning the acting Vali’s (Saad Bey’s) mind over the Zobeir incident referred to my in my letter No. C-43, of the i2th July 1910. The Shaikh is justified in his fear, and I think His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah w'ill confirm my opinion that, should these three prominent men support any improbable story with their collective influence, there is no doubt that the Turkish officials would accept their view, almost without question. 6. The Shaikh was particularly frank with me, because I think he is now more thoroughly alarmed than he has hitherto been. He has held out against all the Vali’s persuasion to register his children as Turkish subjects; the Vali, therefore, though outwardly friendly, is undoubtedly chagrined at his failure: consequently, an atmosphere particularly favourable to the usual methods of Turkish intrigue now exists. 7. I did my best to reassure the Shaikh, enjoining him to be especially careful in his dealings with the Vali so as on no account to rouse active hosti lity. He assured me he would not register either himself or his children as Turkish subjects without the consent of the British Government but he looked to us to assist him in this present difficulty. 8. He asked my advice as to what course he should pursue in the event of Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair actually sending men to resume possession of the Fadaghia property whether accompanied by Turkish officials or without them. I replied I could hardly advice him without reference to the Resident, but I was sure it would be as well to warn his fellahin and agent on the estate (Shaikh Saleh bin Brahim living at Dora) that on no account should there be any show of force or active hostility. Should an attempt be made to resume possession, his agent might endeavour to gain time by treating the intruders hospitably, explaining that he had no orders from his master and that without them he could not leave his charge, whilst requesting them to address the Shaikh direct in the matter. The Shaikh had a letter drafted to this effect at once, and I trust that in the circumstances my action will meet with approval. In view of the Shaikh’s extreme anxiety, .1 would solicit the favour of ins- structions, for the Shaikh certainly anticipates some such move very shortly. P. 5 .—Since the above was drafted, the Shaikh has sent me a copy of the last communication from the Vali on the subject of this property, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy with the Shaikh’s own letter. It will be seen that the Vali’s offer of assistance differs materially from that described in Mr. Consul Crow’s letter No. 20, dated the 6th June 1910, to your address. The Shaikh has sent no reply to this letter. Dated 6th Rajab 1328, 13th July 1910. From— Shaikh Mubarak-es-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, To— Colonee Cox, British Resident and Consul-General, Bushire. After Compliments .—I represented to you descriptively on the 26th Jemadi I 1328 about the dangers which threatened to overtake my property el Fada ghia and forwarded to you a copy of the letter from the Agent of the seller, Abdul Wahab Pasha el Kertas in which he warned me of the evils of delay, and I (stated that I) saw dangers surrounding my property but that my confidence was in your sense of honour and protection. I did not care for all their vain intrigues especially when I received a reply from you dated the 28th Jemadi I 1328 corresponding with the 7th June 1910 in which you stated that the facts of the case have been represented by telegraph to the Government by you and that you hoped that they will be able to devise a proper scheme for the solution of this difficulty in a satisfactory manner. I was much pleased and remained waiting during this period, and the present Vali of Basrah used to evince to meall sorts 0 f courtesy for political ends. Firstly, he asked me to beg for the extension 0 f telegraph wire and 1 excused myself with suitable excuses and explained to him the disagreement of my subjects (to such a course) and diverted his mind. His only hope depended on the second matter, viz., the obtaining of orders fo r the settlement of my property, the el Fadaghia, so that he may con vince m e to register it in the names of my elder sons, Jaber, Salem, Naser and Hamad an d take out Turkish papers of nationality; but I asked that it (the property) should be (registered) in the names of my son Naser and his seven sisters who are minors and that he (Naser) should be appointed as their legal guardian because he is nearly pious and possesses the noble knowledge (Theology), and it was my intention to leave him with his sisters in an isolated property. My elder sons possess the property at Fao which is a large one, and which will be sufficient for them. I tried much to convince him but he could not be convinced. Now there has occurred the intrigue which I feared would take piece in the affair, viz., that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair has arrived from Constantinople and learned about my disagreement with the objects of the Vali and the Vali’s annoyance against me for my failure to comply with his objects ; and he has begun to meddle with the affair and to bring about causes, basing his action on the Government Tapu which he has in his possession The local Government also renders him assistance on the strength of the official Government Tapu. My papers being of the ordinary from, are not to be considered as reliable. All these actions are taken by the Vali with the object of frightening me to yield to his demands. I however do not care for their vain action by the good graces of the High Government, and I depend on righteousness and hold reliable docu ments from them and have shown them copies thereof, and they contain the testimonials of all the leading men of Basrah and the British Consul, Mr. Crow. Under these circumstances I believe that 1 myself, my sons, my town, my subjects, the inhabitants of Kuwait and my properties are under the protection of the British Government; but, as I saw their interference and the intrigues used by them according to reliable information which I have received from my Agent at Basrah and from certain merchants of Basrah who are on friendly terms with me, I send you herewith, the copies of those informations. Inshallah, they will be perused by you and you will endeavour to solve this question a day sooner (i.e., at an early date). I will not absolutely proceed beyond your opinion, idea and consent, and shall not agree with the Vali in his object as regards the taking of Turkish papers of nationality. In the same way that I am obedient to your orders and consent in refusing to take Turkish papers of nationality, you may safeguard my rights and my property on which I have spent a large sum of money, for making watercoures and burrowing, and also protect me from the dodges. I have described all the facts to you, hoping to receive the assistance of the Brilish Government at the earliest time. Please defend me against vain intrigues and afford me your kind regards. May you ever be preserved. (Translation of Enclosure No. i.) Copy of a letter received from a Basrah merchant 'who is a friend of mine. Sir, The circumstances and proceedings of the people of Basrah are not hidden from you. Not a single man exists amongst them who may possess nobleness, 'ibis story is too long and I pray God to improve their condition, because all their proceedings are directed by worldly covetousness. A few days ago Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair came to our side and met with Sayid Talib and Yusuf el Mandi and they convinced him to refuse absolutely the settlement of (the affair) of the el Fadaghia, to nullify the purchase and to refund the money he had received by instalments within fifteen years. In my opinion this is an intrigue of Yusuf and Talib in these days You may write to Talib to use his endeavours and speak with Ahmad and also to use his influence with the Vali to effect asettlement of the el Fadaghia and I do not deem it advisable that the settlement should be delayed any further, because delay has evils. The doings of the house of Zuhair are well known to all the world and to yourself. Talib and Yusuf have been trying for some time past to bring about annoyance between you and the Vali, and it appears that they have found a course to do this in connection with the matter which occurred in the vicinity of Zobeir, vis., the plunder which took place 2 days prior to the Vali’s arrival at our side. Talib, Ahmad and Yusuf convinced Saadat Bey that all these plunders have been committed by order of Shaikh Mubarak and he even wrote you a letter from Mohawwalah on this question. The Vali summoned Saadat Bey yesterday and he made the Vali to understand that this plunder had been done by your order, and the Vali has sent 1 you a strong telegram because he has a changeable mind and he has not firmness | of mind. The clique are determined to create annoyance between you and the Vali and you should know how to reply to him. He believes that the Zobeir question is a fabrication and the cause which has greatly contributed to his annoyance is that you wrote previously that you wished the el Fadaghia to be settled in the names of your elder sons and he wrote to the Porte and obtained a reply, but you stated afterwards that you wished the settlement to be made in the name of Naser and your daughters. This is what has disturbed him. (Enclosure No. 2.) 4th Jemadi 1 1328, 12th June igio. To His Excellency Mubarak-es m Subah Pasha, Kaimmakam {Deputy Governor) of Kuwait. Sir, I have duly received your esteemed letter dated 27th Jemadi I 1328 and I understood what you have stated. I cannot say that it is hidden from you as to what troubles I took to untie the knot formed by His Excellency Mahram Effendi. My hand nails are still feeling the pain, and as a result 1 obtained an irade from the Sublime Porte that the el Fadaghia should be placed in the name of your four sons and you had also requestsd for this. Now, in this your letter you have abandoned what you had asked for and requested that the bargain should be made in the names of your son, Naser Bey and his sisters only. This I cannot represent to the Sublime Porte because it is different from your request, and it becomes necessary for them to draw their attention to what had been written by Mahram Effendi, and if you desire that a reference should be made to the Sublime Porte you may in that case bring forward an argument against that point. It is to be regretted that I cannot say anything against my previous ( statement, according to which I obtained an order from the Sublime Porte. You have large properties in these parts and it is possible for you to give orders that those properties should be registered in the names of your son, Naser Bey, and let the Fadaghia bargain to be made as arranged and thus put an end to this question. This is what has crossed my mind, and you will naturally know what is advisable for you. Salaams. (Sd.) SULEIMAN NAZIF, Vali of the Province of Basrah. (Enclosure No. 3.) It is stated that the Vali is annoyed against Shaikh Mubarak because he (the Shaikh) wrote to him (Vali) that he wished to register el Fadaghia in the names of his elder sons and the Vali accordingly wrote to Constantinople and received a reply, and that Shaikh Mubarak has then written to the Vali that he wishes to register it in the names of Naser and certain ladies. Another cause which has contributed to his annoyance is that he has been told that the Bedouins who had plundered the people of Zobeir are the Arabs of the Shaikh5 and that the latter had sent them to do so in consequence of certain proceedings taken by the people of Zobeir against Shaikh Mubarak. For these reasons the Vali is greatly annoyed. May God improve the situation. It is said that the Vali’s annoyance has been brought about by Ahmad Pasha ^ az»Zuhairwho repudiates the sale and wishes to use certain means which he has in view. (Translation of enclosure No. 4.) Dated 28th Jemadi II1328, 7th June igro. To His Excellency Mubarak Pasha es Sub ah. After Compliments .—l hope that you will always be in good health. I beg to inform you that I have learned from persons whom I consider reliable that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair has been convinced by certain parties to abandon the execution of the settlement on the presumption that the value (paid) is less than what js the worth of the land and that the “ Tash ” (river frontage) has not been included in the measurement and such nonsense. He has made up his mind to send surveyors to take measurements, and, if the surveyors are prevented from doing this, they will then turn out the farmers through the Government because he holds Government papers, and the Govern ment makes the land over to the party holding Government papers without making a reference to the Courts. A certain friend of his has given him advices —and I think it must have been Abdul VVahab-el-Kertas—(stating that) the matter will result in litigation and it is advisable that he should wait, and he will of course receive a letter from Shaikh Mubarak to effect a settlement and that he should write that he has been deceived in the valuation, and the land is more than the measurement and the “ Tash ” has not been included in the measure ment, and that either he should make a second measurement with an addition of so much money on every jarib, or, if he did not agree to this course, the land should be restored to him (Ahmad) and the value to be refunded by instalments in the course of 10 years. This is what his friend has told him. Ahmad Pasha has kept quiet accordingly. The object of these devilish temptations is that Abdul Wahab-el-Kertas should intervence in the matter and be benefited through his intervention by (the forsaking of) the claim which you have against him, in the same way that he was benefited from the 2,500 Turkish pounds which was due to you by him, and which he took in lieu of brokerage when you purchased the lands. And Ahmad Pasha will probably not agree even if you pay him a larger amount than the value of the property, and the truth or falseness of this news will become evident to you whenever you wish to record his statement in the Government Office for the purpose of taking out documents. This is what was necessary to be stated to you. (Sd.) ABDUL HAMID-EL-SHOAIBI. P. S. —I shall let you know anything fresh that may take place. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. C 2866 F. D.— io-8-io.— 44-E. A.

I hare the honour to acknowledge receipt of a copy of your letter Uo.1880, dated the 1. 0th July 1910, and as it seems of importance to define clearly the grounds of the Turkish insistence on nationality certificates I venture to submit below some observations which I trust will make the various points clearer. A. It will be convenient to separate what the Turkish officials mm ± are legally entitled to insist upon from what appears to be their present practice (1) Hypotheses (1) ana (11) in your letter under reference are both partially correct, for the acquirer of land must declare his nationality at the time of registering the transfer of the property. For example, an Englishman acquiring land in Basrah would declare his English nationa lity and the same would be duly entered in the 'Tapu* office registers when the transfer to his name was applied for. In any subsequent suit regarding his land the fact of registration in the M tapu M office books would give the Englishman the right ana opportunity to defend or enforce his rights by appearance in the proper Turkish Court. He would, however, sue or be sued in a manner exactly similar toto any Turkish subject, his Consul not having the right to assist him in any way nor ooull he plead any rights under the Capitulations 0 Thus, with the transfer recorded he becomes, for all matters concerning that land, practi cally a Tuzkish subject, though enjoying his own nation ality. If he neglects to have the transfer to his own name recorded, he has no right to appear as a party at an in any Turkish Court. The courts will only recognize and hear those foreigners in whose names the land actually stands in the 'Tapu H office books, while Turks, of course, always have the right to appear by virtue of their nation ality. This example will show what is the legal position of a foreigner acquiring land in Basrah. (11). The authorities in Basrah, however go beyond this legal position and insist on Turkish nationality certifi- oates being produced by all and sundry, under threat of refusing registration of transfer. They rely on the natural ignorance and fear of legal technicalities prevail ing among the Arabs onu Persians who wish to acquire land in the Basrah Yilayat as well as their apprehension of losing property already paid for, without a possibility of legal remedy. This belief is sedulously fostered by the authorities amongst the ignorant, but no such preposterous demand is made from an English French or other subject who is certain to make enquiries and ascertain the legal position. So successful has the misrepresentation been that several r/ealthy and well educated men connected with Basrah, with whom I have discussed the matter,refused to believe that I could personally acquire land in Basrah and have the transfer registered in the 'Tapu' office in my own name without first bee caning a Turkish subject myself. In addition to the above, the authorities refuse to admit that KuwaitisKuwaitia or inleei suiy Araba at all have any separate nationality - they olaim that all Arabs, ipao facto , are the Sultan's subjects and therefore lurka in nationality. Consequently in pursuance of the new regime*s| efforts to consolidate the Turkish Empire, the opportunity is apparent^ ly being utilized in the case of the landed olaaaea, ( at all events in these outlying provinces), to force an out ward and visible sign of Turkish nationality upon Arabs who hitherto have regarded, themselves as more or less inde pendent, though owning religious allegiance to the Sultan as the Zhalif of Islam. 4. The matter is an intricate one which the general ignorance of even well-educated. Arabs, combined with the Shaikh's tortuous methods, makes none the easier to eluci date, but I trust that I have given its bearings sufficient ly clearly above to show that recognition by the Turkish authorities of ‘•Kuwaiti' as a distinct nationality would go far towards a,permanent settlement of the present as well as the larger question of the whole status of Kuwait. .'•3 e I have, eto., •• • ' - ~ - 3d/- ft. ii.

Instant relative to the difficulties experienced hy the Sheikh of Koweit in the matter of the registration of his pro perty at Fadagia, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to recall attention to the similar situation which arose in connexion with the purchase hy the same chief of date gardens at Fao last year. In this case also the Vali of Basra declined to allow Sheikh Mubarak to complete the transaction unless he consented to describe himself as an Ottoman subject and, in consequence of His Excellency’s attitude, His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make a declaration to the Sublime Ports respecting the status of Koweit, though discretion was left to hi as to the choice of a moment for doing so. In his despatch No. 396 of May 28th. 1909 Sir G. stated the reasons for which, in his opinion. it ie Under Secretary of State, India Office.(29259/10) it was undesirable at that time to raise this question which has since been allowed to remain dormant. I am to state that Sir E. Grey is still unaware of the way in which the difficulty regarding the registra tion of the Sheikh's Pao property was surmounted as it undoubtedly was and that he would be glad to be fur nished with early information on this point in the hope that it might prove of use in settling the present con troversy. I am accordingly to suggest that, if Viscount Morley sees no objection, a telegram of enquiry should be addressed to the Government of India on the subject.

Copy of a letter No €.-36, (Confidential,) dated Kuwait, the 15th June 1910, from Captain W. H. /. Shakespear, LA., Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to certain items in my diaryf for the fExtract attached. current week relating to the reported in terest of the present Wali of Basrah in matters concerning Kuwait I have referred to the same subject in recent reports dealing with other matters but as further information seems to point to the fact that the question of the exact status of Kuwait as between Turkey and Great Butain before very long will inevitably be forced upon us for some definite solution, I am led to put before you such information as has so far come to my knowledge and brought me to this conclusion. 2. In October 1909 I heard from Muhammerah that Shaikh Mubarak’s Secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr, was reported to be trying to brin^ about a closer union between Kuwait and the Turkish Government. I did not credit the report at the time and have had no reason to do so later, for the man himself was imprisoned by the Turks for some considerable time in Basrah and has no particular cause to regard them with affection, though no doubt he mioht be willing to act as their tool for a substantial consideration. Shaikh Mubarak also trusts hun more than any other person of his entourage which l think would be unlikely if he knew or had the slightest reason to suspect him of any intri°-ue He is, however, always employed as the Shaikh’s confidential agent in matters Sit Hacroh 0 3. In October 1909 the present Wali, Suliman Nathif Bey, arrived at Basrah and at once began to show his mettle by summary orders for the general improve- condltlonsin Basrah. He also began cultivating Shaikh Mubarak’s friendship most assiduously. Meetings between the Wali and the Shaikh became tar more frequent than has been the case with former incumbents; and wherever possible, the Wall has done his best to attract Mubarak with assistance in matters which closely affect his pocket. The Shaikh in discussing the Wali to me said that though the Wall was always talking about impossible schemes he had undoubtedly done much for Mubarak himself, especially in regard to his properties at Fao where he had put an end to all difficulties in the repairing of his date-garden embankments, encroachments by the Turkish military authorities etc., by going down himself and issuing the requisite orders in person. He had also obtained from Constantinople the rescission of the suspensory orders which had created so much of the difficulty about his Fadhagiya property. 4 . Against these benefts we have the reported proposals of the Wali to connect Kuwait and Basrah by telegraph, to despatch Turkish officers in charge ° ^ a t ! tI -, g ^ menet -? ^!

As bearing on this subject it may be of interest to note here that the items in my diary were obtained from a local source but curiously enough were con firmed almost exactly in conversation with M. Toukholka, Russian Consul at Basrah, during his few hours’ visit to Kuwait. He said to me that he was much interested in Persian Gulf politics, and having but lately arrived in Basrah, where he constantly heard the position of Kuwait discussed, he was naturally desirous of seeing the place and its ruler, to use his own words “ he had no instructions to pursue any active policy at Basrah for the place did not really affect Russia, and consequently he had very little to do officially. Thus he was afforded the oppor tunity of seeing our position in regard to Kuwait, the Baghdad Railway, Muhammerah and the Persian Gulf generally from the point of view of an inter ested on-looker,” He said he had heard in Basrah that Mubarak used to fly a flag which was exactly similar to the Turkish with the exception that the Kuwait flag carried three white stars but that within the last two years Mubarak at the request of the Wali had reverted to one star! He informed me that his own introduction from the Wali to Mubarak bore the superscription of “ Kaimmakam of Kuwait,” and that the Wali had frequently mentioned the position of Kuwait in conversation ; he had said that the policy of the new Turkey was to maintain the status quo, which, so far as Kuwait was concerned, he was convinced the Turks regarded as implying distinct subjection to them, and that to prevent the possibility of Kuwait vanishing beyond their hold, as they considered had already happened in the cases of Maskat and Bahrain owing to their own negligence, they would probablv make some serious effort to establish in Kuwait an indubitable visible sign of their predominance. He thought we should have a very difficult question to solve more specially as the new Turkish Government was a vastly different affair to the one to which the Powers had become accustomed under the regime of Abdul Hamid. His own experience in Macedonia and Albania less than six months ago before his appointment to Basrah had shown him the differ- ence very plainly. ^ He said that the W ali at Basrah was undoubtedly working for his own coun try s good and that he was supported whole-heartedly by Nazim Pasha. The latter though styled Wali of Baghdad had been sent out by the Turkish Govern ment with a promise of generous support and had been given a free hand first to re-organize thoroughly the Vlth Army Corps, and, when that object had been achieved and an effective weapon been thereby supplied, to consolidate Turkish power in the southern vilayets and amongst the Arabs. • TO x UkI ?u lka S n0t , a ? pear t0 me 10 be tr y in g t0 ob tain information ™ S y ’ , f i? r ffi° U ^ h h u e a ® ke J S0,n e inconvenient questions as to how we regard ed Mubarak officially he hardly waited for a reply and seem more intent on dis playing his own knowledge of and interest in the situation than in deliberately pumping me.

He expresses himself as being averse to any such influence but at the same time compelled to meet the Wah amicably and to do nothing likely to arouse his animosity for fear of reprisals on his properties on the Shatt-el-Arab. • , That the Shaikh desires absolute independence is certain, but he has suffi- cient acumen to see that his property on the river furnishes Turkey with a valu able hostage from himself, that we for our own reasons do not desire the growthof Turkish influence at the head of the Persian Gulf, and that Kuwait is therefore in the happy position of being sought by two Great Powers, thus affording him a lever by which he can increase his own importance while balancing the two Powers against each other in all matters concerning himself.

C 40 ) Political Agent at Koweit dated 30th June 1910. ) ) on the subject of the registration question difficulty, connected with the transfer of Sheikh Mubarak's Fadaghia property, in continu ation of the correspondence ending with Foreign Department Endorsement Ho. 1290-E.A., dated 21st June 1910. 2. Captain Shakespear's present communication seems to me to confuse two hypotheses, or aspects of the question, which need to be distinguished, and to introduce a third which is new to me. (i). The first of these is that the Wali of Basrah is te^chnically and legally correct in his attitude towards the transfer question (as CaptainCaptain Shakespear suggests in paragraph 6 of his letter ]5o. 35 of 8th June) and is merely inter preting against the public, including Sheikh Mubarak, the provisions of a law of general application in the Basrah Vilayet, - a dead letter under the old regime but strictly enforced under the new, - which permits of no transfer of landed property in the said Vilayet except on the condition that the acquirer declares himself to be of Turkish nationality. (n). The second hypothesis is that the Wali's attitude is not based on any such law of general applica tion in the Vilayet, but is merely an arbitrary departure from ordinary usage devised in the hope that by throwing Sheikh Mubarak into a state of apprehension lest his bargain should otherwise be upset and himself possibly put to great loss, they will drive him to declare himself or his sons to be of Turkish nationality. • The third and. to me new aspect of the question is indicated in paragraph 2 of Captain Shakespear’s present report, namely, that the Basrah authorities do not primarily and positively contend that Sheikh Mubarak must necessarily declare Turkish nationality he might declare French, English or any other nationality if he enjoyed it, but that 'Koweit^is no nationality and that for Sheikh Mubarak Turkish nationality alone is indicated. 3. If the position with which we now have to deal were that indicated in (iii), then it would seem that it might be possible forks to induce the Porte in a friendly way to acceptaccept the definition 'Koweiti as a nationality for purposes of registration in the case of land-transfers, in order to avoid the raising of awkward issues. A recent report, however, from Mohammerah seems to indicate that hypothesis (iii) eliminated. Lieutenant Wilson writes that the Sheikh of Mohammerah informs him that the lands in Turkish limits which he purchased last year, known as Umm-el-Tuwailah (an Island above Failiyeh) have not yet been registered, the present Vali having refused to permit it and that the Sheikh has decided to wait on events and let the registration remain in abeyance until he sees what action we are going to take to see Sheikh Mubarak through his present difficulty. It would appear, therefore, that it is either contingency (i) or (ii) with which we have to reckon. In the former case, if we make enquiries from the Porte they will probably reply that their Wall's action is not directed against Sheikh Mubarak but is merely the interpretation of existing land-laws applicable to the Basrah Vilayet; that Sheikh Mubarak is under no obligation to buy property in the Basrah Vilayet, but that if he does, he must fulfil the same preliminaries and conditions as other persons; and that unless he complies the transfer cannot be recognised by the Turkish Courts and so the property must be considered asstill belonging to the persons in whose naae it has hitherto stood. We should then be confronted with the issue indicated in the concluding paragraph of my letter of 19th June. 4. If on the other hand the position indicated in (ii) is the one with which w e have to deal, the issue is simpler 8nd V/e seeK t0 have g° od reasons for objecting on the ground that the invidious treatment of Sheikh Mubarak and the departure from past usage involved, constitutes an infringe ment of the status quo in regard to Koweit affairs which the Porte has undertaken to observe. The Mohammerah report above mentioned, however, seems to point to hypothesis (i) as the correct one. 5. It goes without saying that I entirely endorse the Political Agent's view that if the main question of the status of Koweit is involved we have everything to lose by delaying to face the issue, and that the longer we do so, the more difficult will it become to get it settled in the way we desire.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the correspondencejjoverei by your Second Assistant's endorsements 3oa.l65£. and 16#8, dated 21st and 22nd June 1910 respectively. 2. I would first correct a possible misunderstanding to which the latter part of paragraph 6 of my letter Io.C.35, dated the 8th June 1910 may give rise. When I sail 'Turkish nationality' I meant the sentence to ai^ply only to llubarak and Koweitis for of course other nationalities such as English, French, etc are accepted, but in the case of Eoweitis, the Turkish officials will not accept 'Koweit' but insist on 'Turkish nationality. 3. With reference to your letter So.1650, dated 19th June 1910 to the Government of India and especially to paragraph 3 thereof I would venture to submit the following observa tions resulting from a thorough discussion of the whole subject with His iiajesty's Consul at Hasrah. In your letter you foresee the possible alternative of advising Sheikh Mubarak to re-sell the property and of having to indemnify him for any loss thereon. With all deference I would venture to deprecate any such course and for the following reasons fa). The Sheikh is certainly aixamad'about this property but at the same time I am inclined to thinkthink now he is not improbably exaggerating that alarm \ our special benefit as a means of forcing our hand to free him from Turkish attentions. | (b) Mr. Consul Crow considers that the possibility of the sale being repudiated is an extremely remote one seeing that the sale deeds bear the signatures of most of the notables of Basrah as well as the cachet of the British Consulate. (c) The property is so large that a buyer would be difficult to find who would purchase it as a single lot, and there is besides the grave objection in the alvice of a resale of an appearance of weakness on our part in sustaining the Sheikh's claim. 4. In my humble opinion it would be far more advantageous to maintain the position of our special interests in Koweit, the Sheikh's long continued independent status, whilst pressing upon the Porte that the recognition of Koweit as a nationality should suffice for the 'Tapu' office. The Porte is r I admit, not likely to agree but as there seems no immediate risk of the sheikh losing his property, it would seem worth while to state the above as defining to some extent what is the actual status quo in Koweit. 5. The question of the status of Koweit must come up before many years and it seems fairly obvious that the Turkish officials have realized the powerful lever they possess for raising that issue in the registration question, which goes directly to the root of the matter on the point of nationality. The registration of any of Mubarak's family, whether the women or sons, would seem undesirable as likely to admit the jexxxxx^xi principle that Koweit nationality is unrecognisable as against Turkish. For the same reason the taking out of Turkish 'teskerehs'' by Koweit subjects is to be deprecated and thoughmany the Sheikh ienies it I hear from other sources that Eoweitis with business or lani in Basrah have already done this. Under the new order of things this practice is likely to grow and in a few years hence it seems to me there will be far greater difficulty in insisting on the independence of Koweit than is the case at present, and it is for that reason that I would urge that the question should not be avoided, I have, etc., Sd/** W.

I beg to state that Ahmed Pasha e l Zoheir and Abdul Wahab Pasha el Kertascame to me at Koweit and Ahmed Pasha el Zoheir sold (to me) the El Fadaghia (landed property) for the sum of 48,700 (forty-eight thousand seven hundred and six) Turkish Liras and I pent my confidential employe, Abdul Aziz el Salem, with them to Basrah and they informed the Wal, of Basrah, Mahram Bey, (of the sale) and he wished me pros- P ^ r u ty Au t j e r. ba y ga11 ?^ While making the purchase, I firstly made a condition with Ahmed Pasha el Zoheir and his Agent, Abdul Wahab Pasha el Kertas that t hey should settle the Tapoo (official deed of purchase) for me. A communica tion was made by my confidential employe, Abdul Aziz el Salem, with the Wali of Basrah for the Tapoo documents, and the Wali ordered Abdul Aziz el Salem to go to the place where the landed property was situated, take surveyors with him and ascertain the area of the land so that it may be recorded in the Tapoo. My confidential employe went over there, taking surveyors with him and paying their expenses, as it was made a condition that I should bear these expenses and the area of the land was ascertained and they returned to Basrah, where he (Abdul Aziz) met Mahram Bey and reported the measurement to him. He (Mahram JT.'? S J et , t,e , the matter in the G °ve rnme nt Department as usual and he (Abdul Aziz) did what was requisite. The seller and his agent appeared / A? CT' yy ■ 'Cf t 0there and admitted the sale and the receipt of the value. Afterwards the Wall of Basrah, Mahram Bey, informed my confidential employe, Abdul Aziz el Salem, that he had received an order from Constantinople to fefer the settlement until further orders. After this purchase was made by me, some of my subjects inhabiting Koweit (by name) Hussein and his brother Shamlan, Ibrahim bin Muzaffer and Helal, purchased the landed property belonging to the sons of Kasem el Thani, and it was recorded in the Tapoo for them, without any demand being made for their Turkish certificates of nationality Similarly a year before this purchase, I bought a landed property at Motavvah during the Waliship of Abdul Rahman Hassan Bey and it was duly written in the name of my childern without their demanding any Turkish certificates of nationality. Nowadays an order having been received from Constantinople by the Wali of Basrah to settle (the affair of the) landed property and the postponement until further instructions having been removed, I sent my confidential employe. AbdutAziz el Salem, to the present Wall of Basrah Soleiman Nadhif Bey (to state that), according to a telegram received by me from the, seller Ahmed el Zoheir, orders have been given for a settlement. The Wali refused to do so, however, unless the property is recorded in the names of my senior sons, Jaber, Salem, Naser /jnd Hamad and they should take out Turkish certificates of nationality. My confidential employe returned with this reply. I did not accept this unless I should refer to you and act upon what you may order. Afterwards I found an easy solution for this matter—in the same way as I have been treating them with kindness for the sake of convenience—and sent my employe to the Wali of Basrah asking him to record one half of the property in the name of my son Naser and the other half in the name of my seven daughters, as my son Naser was dear to me for many reasons and I found him to be inclined to piety and I appointed him as guardian over the landed property belonging to them jointly. My confidential employe stated this to the Wali but the Wali refused and did not agree unless the property should be written in the names of my four sons who should take out Turkish certificates of nationality. When 1 saw that this was the case I postponed action until f should refer to you because I will do nothing without your order and desire. This is an urgent affair because they do not now recognise the property to be in my name and they did not even demand from me the Mirri (fixed land revenue) for the last year but demanded it from the seller who replied that he had sold the property to Sheikh Mubarak es Subah, but they did not demand it from me and do not recognise the property to be mine although it is in my possession and I have incurred considerable expenses in repairing, constructing buildings and growing date-palms and trees thereon ; and 1 also took a document from the seller at the time of the purchase which contains the attestation of all the notables of Basrah and when the document was completed, the British Consul at Basrah, Mr. Crow, certified thereto. During my interview with you on your return from Naseri you asked me (about this) and I stated that the settlement has not been made as yet, but that 1 was treating them kindly as perhaps the affair could be settled more easily and you stated that I should not agree to my sons taking Turkish certificates of nationality. Neither for the sake of this property nor for anything greater than this, will I take any action against your consent and order, I, my sons, my town, Koweit, my property and my honour are all under the protection of the exalted Government as mentioned in the Treaty, and so it follows that my property also under their protection. Now the matter has reached the highest degree and this is an urgent affair. So I beg of your sense of justice and honour to find a good scheme which may prevent my property being played with and endangered, as I do not feel sure that they will not misdirect the attention of Ahmed Pasha el Zoheir and will not assist him to play a dodge to do me harm. Your good graces will not agree to this and I beg to receive the favour of a reply which may render my mind easy as I have seen certain indications on their part which frigh ten me as regards the future and I am awaiting your order at the earliest date so that I may be sure of receiving your high regards. Herewith you will find a true copy of a letter which I have received from the Agent* of Ahmed Pasha el Zoheir, Abdul Wahab Pasha el Kertas, and I expect to receive your sincere con siderations ; and at any rate, it rests with you to give orders. May you be preserved.Copy of a letter, dated 24th Jemadi 1 1328 (3rd June igro),from Abdul Wahab Pasha, el Kertas to Sheikh Mubarak es Subah.

As regards the settlement of el Fadaghia affair an order has been received for the settlement to be effected. In consideration of my sincere regards I venture to tell you to avail yourself of this opportunity and have this settlement effected in the same way as you requested in the days of Mahram Bey, and do not lose this chance because delay will produce evil in every way—either on the part of the Government or on that of my cousin Ahmed Pasha, as I guess he will depose me of the Agency. I think you should not delay the affair. May God guide the Honourable Ahmed Pasha. His dealings with me are all of a hostile charac ter and it is now more than i-| months that he does not communicate with me, but communicates with another.

On his return from Basrah where the Sheikh had meft the Wali, he in formed me that he had sent a long and urgent letter to you from Fao giving the latest demands of the Turkish officials. The Sheikh also furnished me with a copy of this letter to you of the 26th Jemadi el Awwal 1328, together with a copy of the enclosure. 3. The case is very plainly set out in the Sheikh’s letter and it is therefore unnecessary to repeat its purport here. Sheikh Mubarak for some reason, which I cannot at present divine, was most anxious that I should see the original of Abdul Wahab el Kertas' letter (a copy of which accompanied the Sheikh’s letter) and that 1 should inform you that I had done so. He seemed to attach great importance to the advice tendered by Abdul Wahah el Kertas not to delay in registering the property although it necessitated compliance with the Turkish demands as a necessary preliminary. 4. The Sheikh said he was most anxious, for Abdul Wahab’s letter showed that for some reason Ahmed Pasha Zoheir did not seem to be as well disposed to him (Abdul Wahab el Kertas) as he used to be, and if he caused any trouble the Sheikh would be left without a remedy. The Sheikh by this insinuation means Jreally that Ahmed Pasha Zohelr, from the members of whose family the property was purchased^ in a such position that the Turkish law will help him at every turn if the case came to depute. It will be advantageous to recall the main facts j that four separate sale^ deeds were executed, that nearly all the property really belonged to women of Ahmed Pasha's family; that he was their attorney ; that he then constituted Abdul Wahatel Kertas as his attorney for the sale to Sheikh Mubarak; that the property still stands in the names of some 10 different persons in the books of the “ Tapoo ’’ (land registration) office ; that the purchase price has been paid over in full and heavy further expenditure incurred by the Sheikh on improve ments, buildings, etc. Consequently if Ahmed Pasha, either as the result of Turkish intrigue or through personal greed, laid claims to the property, repudiat ed the sale or induced any of the persons concerned to repudiate either a power of attorney or the sale of their own particular portion the only course for Sheikh Mubarak would be to file a suit in the Turkish courts. If he did so in order to establish his rights he is at once face to face with entries in the land record office books showing the property as still belonging to the Zoheir family. Moreover without a Turkish nationality certificate^it is a question whether he could even plead in the Turkish courts. Mr. Consul Crow gives the legal position very clearly in his despatch No. 6 to the Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, dated the 12th February 1909, a copy of which as forwarded to me under your office endorsement No. 2667, dated the 24th October 1909, and I would invite a reference thereto: it will be seen from this despatch how helpless Sheikh Mubarak would be in the event of the Fadaghia property becoming a subject of litigation. This insecurity will continue so long as the transfers are not legally effected in the “ Tapoo ” office records. 5. Since the revolution in Constantinople I am informed that the greatest strictness has been observed and insisted upon in all matters in which the laws require that nationality should be proved. In the case of land transfers this rule is complied with by the person desiring the transfer to his name producing his certificate of Turkish nationality. This law / which I understand not to be a new one by any means used to be freely evaded under the old regime with com parative ease, but'that evasion has now become impossible. , 6. Though the transfer of the Fadaghia property was originally prevented PolFicai reasons, these have now been sufficiently explained by the present Wah not to exist, in so tar that he has satisfied himself that the purchase was bona fide and not effected with Bn&amp;h gold. Accordingly the Wali asked the authorities in Constantinople to rescind their previous order of suspension and this request h as been approved. It was to this rescission that my letter No. C- 2 6, dated the nth May 1910 referred. ’ The crux of the position now is that the a f’ low c of a Ie gal transfer without the admission of Turkish nationality and the Wah therefore would seem to be perfectly correct in his attitude when he informs the Sheikh that he may effect the transfer to-morrow if he wishes but that the law requires the production of a “ teskereh ” of Turkish nationality by the person to whose name the transfer is to be made. His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah may be able to verify if this view is substantially correct. * nf StZikH'vf 1 \° thS WaH r insisti 'g on the transfer being made to the names of Sheikh Mubarak s four sons, I am informed by the Sheikh’s Secretary that this , ansen , throu g h the . fact that when the property was first purchased, he Sheikh desired it to be registered in the names of his four sons and the pre- stonmA hv^^n™! 6 ' 13 r 1 ” 6 311 mad r acc ° rdin g 1 y until the whole matter was has^hl^h- de - rS a° f s u s Pe ns i on f rom Constantinople Since then the Sheikh hi blind ^nn mind and wishes the property to be ir^ribed in the name of h.s blind son Nasir and h.s seven daughters. This, however, appears to me to quesTffin o'f l min ° r WhlCh C ° uM P robabl y be g°t over when the primary question of the necessity for registration as a Turkish subject is solved. 8. As his letter to you shows, the Sheikh is exceedingly anxious for there of hTf 'd Way T 7 u ° U u- 0f th6 difGc uhy- He has not, so far, registered any securi/v ’ y tf- S TUf f SUb]eCt jf’ th °u§ h I fear that his apprehension for the security of his property, worth nearly £50,000, may before long induce him tocomply with the Turkish demand, perhaps unknown to us until too late, and it is for this reason I would be elad of something of a reassuring nature which I can communicate to the Sheik£ I have told him that I am putting the matter before you in detail and advised nim to await the decision of His Majesty’s Govern- 9. Though an unpleasant question to handle in view of the regeneration of Turkey it would seem that we are now confronted with the solution of the posi tion of Koweit as between an independent Sheikhdom or a vassal appanage of Turkey. The Sheikh is an old man, anxious not to lose a valuable property nor its revenues during his own lifetime, and in the absence of some solid assistance which will permanently relieve him of his present difficulty is quite capable of safeguarding his undoubted rights by compliance with Turkish dfemands and pleading “ force majeure ” to us. I was told once that he himself had cynically remarked that it would be for his son Jabir and not for him in his own lifetime to fight out the position of Koweit between the Turks and the English and while he thanked God it would be so, he pitied Jabir. The present Wali of Basrah loses . ' 0 opportunity of trying to bring Turkish influence actually into Koweit and to ^ identify Koweit with Basrah—witness the Koweit-Basrah telegraph idea, the sug- gestibn for Koweit gendarmerie for A 1 Hassa under Turkish officers, ’ and the frequent meetings between Sheikh Mubarak and the Wali. 10. That Sheikh Mubarak is aware his port and country stand to lose by definitely becoming subject to Turkey is I think true, but he has now reached an age (some 7 2 years) when he is also inclined to favour a prospect ensuring him ease and freedom from Turkish worries during his remaining years and to add ‘aprds nous le deluge . In reply to your letter No. 1280 of May 22nd last on the subject of the registration of Sheikh Mubarak’s property at Fadaghia, I have the honour to state that, accordmg to information I have received here, orders were sent by the Sublime Porte to the effect that Sheikh Mubarak may transfer his property in the names of his four sons, as he asked in Mahram Bey’s time, provided he registers them as Ottoman subjects. &amp; I understand Slieikh Mubarak has on many occasions applied to have the land transferred in the names of his sons but that he does not agree to take out 1 eskerehs of Ottoman nationality for them and. on his rprpnt visit- tr&gt; RacnV.

In this connection I venture to recall my letter No. 3593 of 27th Decem ber 1908 and to express the hope that an improvement in the financial outlook now makes it possible for the Government of India to take into lively considera tion the question of a wireless installation at Koweit; especially if the parallel proposals regarding Bahrein and Bushire now before Government in connection with the arms traffic question are to be put into execution. No. C.-29, dated Koweit, the 25th May 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to submit below some details which Sheikh Mubarak communicated to me in the course of a more than usually frank conversation and which, in view of the recent appointment of Nazim Pasha, one of the able leaders of the new regime in Turkey, to be Viceroy de facto oi the three Vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, may be of interest to Government. 2. Sheikn Mubarak said that once in a conversation the present Wali of Basra had suggested that the construction of a land telegraph line from Basra or A* a0 u t0 , ^. owei | f . would b e a great convenience to the place; it would bring Mubarak himself into closer touch with his properties on the river and with the Wa i and would afford the Koweit merchants greater facilities in their commercial dealings. _ The Sheikh told me he had disparaged the idea saying that apart irom the initial expense which presumably would fall on the Turkish Government tnere would be constant trouble with the Bedouin, who woild certainly be always cutting the wire and harassing the telegraph officials; also there was little chance ° re e sc b eme paying its way, for Koweit had a regular weekly post which suthced for its needs and in the rare instances when a telegram was necessary it could easily be sent by post to Bushire and telegraphed thence or even direct to rao by the water-boats always running to and fro thence. He said he thought the Bedouins would be an insuperable obstacle to a land wire whilst a sea cable which was the only way over that difficulty would be enormously expensive and would naturally have to be a British undertaking. He added that the Wali even iscussed the possibility of connecting A 1 Hassa with Koweit and thence with Basra by a land wire and perhaps in the dim future running a line to Riadh and Hail. 1 asked the Sheikh if it was possible that the Wali could be speaking seriously of such schemes which he must be aware are at present quite impracti- cable tor he has by now experienced at least some of the certain opposition of the Bedouin tribes. He said he did not know, but that Suliman Nathif Beg was a great talker ”. &amp; ' 3. Another interesting detail was that the present Wali had dropped a ff . ^ e ® s, pg tbe sheikh as Kaimakam of Kuweit, the previous practice of Turkish ofhdais in their communications to him, and now he was usually styled “ Rais ” or Hakim of Koweit. ,. 4 - He also said that the Wali occasionally asked him why he hadVnade himself subject to the English when his real interests were bound up with Turkey. I rci , 0 k2 The Sheikh said he replied to this insinuation by explaining that he was not subject to the English Government; there was an old friendship between Koweit and the English from the time of his forefathers, and it was natural when the English had so much to do with the Persian Gulf; kept the peace there between various conflicting interests and safe-guarded the pearl-banks; when most of the trade in the Gulf was English or with Indian ports; when numbers of Koweit vessels traded directly with Bombay and Malabar coast ports; when their officers everywhere in the Gulf and India helped his subjects, as well as those of other Persian Gulf Chiefs, in their difficulties away from home. He was friends with the English as he was with the Wali and other Turkish officials. 5. I give the above for what it is worth, but venture to think that our posi- j tion in Koweit is probably far more closely watched now by the new Turkish Government than it ever was before the Constantinople revolution. With refer ence to paragraph 2 above and the Wali’s ideas on telegraphic connection it may be noted here that the Sheikh has more than once asked me why the British Government does not instal a telegraph office here, more particularly a wireless station for the use of the Political Agent. I have always explained that these schemes cost money and the British Government requires that they should pay their expenses; an office only to give the Political Agent better communication was quite impracticable, but if there was a fair prospect of sufficient return for the outlay from public use and the Sheikh himself desired it, no doubt they would consider the project. The subject has never been pursued beyond incidental conversation on the merits of quick communication and it is doubtful whether an office here would pay expenses for a long time after installation.

Abdul Aziz left Koweit on the 28th April and the Sheikh hoped to hear from him by letter in a few days, when he said he would let me know if anything had been done. 3 I also took the opportunity of again pressing on the Sheikh the undesir ability of complicating matters further by registering any member of his family as a Turkish subject in order to have the transfer carried out under that person s name, as he had contemplated.

The Sheikh added that the ( ouestion had come up in the Turkish Chamber and the orders of which Ahmed Pasha had informed him were the result.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 725, dated the 20th March 1910. 2. It will be remembered I last reported the Sheikh as informing me that nothing had passed on the subject of the registration of his properties when he met the Wali of Basrah during his visit up-river in February. I have since received a copy of Mr. Consul Crow’s despatch No. 14, dated the 9th March 1910, to His Majesty’s Ambassador which gives a vastly different account of what passed at the same meeting. After receiving it I took an opportunity of leading the Sheikh back to the subject, when the Sheikh surprised me by giving me an account much the same as Mr. Crow’s, apparently completely oblivious of its contradiction with what he had already told me. I rallied the Sheikh on Abdul Wahab-al-Kirtas’ speech at the banquet, and the Sheikh laughingly replied that such sentiments were the usual accompaniment of similar entertainments and were “ words.” They were useful as keeping the Turkish authorities pleased without being committal. 3. At a subsequent interview, when the Sheikh came to see me immediately after his return from Failiyeh, on the &amp;th April, he was full of a second meeting he had just had with the Wali at an entertainment given by Abdul Wahab-al- Kirtas at Seraiji. The Sheikh gave the conversation as follows:—the Wali had condoled with him regarding the reverse suffered at Sheikh Sadun’s hands and had then gone on to flatter and compliment him, after which the Wali had explained that the Ministry of the Interior at Constantinople had asked him the following questions :— (1) Had Mubarak bought the Fadhagiya property really himself from Ahmed Pasha Zohair and had he paid the purchase-money ? (2) What was its area and the price paid for it ? (3) Whether there were any claims by the State on any of the land ? The Wali said that he had replied to these queries both to the Ministry and to the Grand Vizier as follows:— (1) That Mubarak had paid the price at the time of purchase and had had possession ever since. (2) That the area was 480 'jaribs” and the price paid ^T 48,000. (3) That the property was unencumbered and that the State had no lien on it. That Mubarak already held property in the Basrah Vilayet of an estimated value of some four million pounds Turkish. ,c l&lt;o OM aoW/'o)Having told him so much the Wali had then said that theTapu Office would register the transfers in the Sheikh’s name and that of his sons as he desired. The Sheikh told me that the Wali did not explain that he acted on any orders from Constantinople, and, though he expected the usual condition to follow, (that of Mubarak’s registration as a Turkish subject), no such demand was made by the Wali on this occasion. He therefore merely thanked the Wali and wondered what had brought about the change in his formerly hostile attitude. 4. If the above account is true, and, from the fact that the Sheikh announced in his “ Majlis ” on his return that the Wali had said his properties should be duly registered, I am inclined to think it is, it would seem either that the Ottoman Government has waived its objection of its own motion or that the Wali has really convinced it of Mobarak’s bona fides in the purchase; whichever may be the case, the situation seems to have improved considerably. 5. On my enquiring from the Sheikh whether he had asked Abdul Wahab-al- Kirtas to approach the Tapu Office again before the Wall’s benevolent attitude should change, he informed me that he had already told him to carry through the transfers, that he would on no account register himself as a Turkish subject though if the difficulty could be got over by registering the names of Nasir (his blind son) and some of his women-folk as Turkish subjects, he would have no objection, I pointed out that in view of the Wali’s new attitude this would be unnecessary, and I was almost sure would be regarded by Government as most undesirable. I added I was giving my own view in order that, if he agreed with it himself, he might instruct Abdul Wabab-al-Kirtas not to delay, but that, if he preferred, I could write and obtain your opinion. As the Sheikh expressed himself willing to hear my opinion I w'ent on to point out that the course was undesirable for the following reasons :—(«) none of the Sheikh’s other property was registered as belonging to a Turkish subject {i.e., in the name of a person holding a Turkish nationality certificate) with the exception of his Mutawiya gardens as explained in paragraph 10 of my letter No. C.-y, dated the i8rh January 1910, (b) that, by taking out a certificate of Turkish nationality for any of his own family, hewmuld create a precedent which had hitherto never existed, (c) that having done so would furnish the Turkish authorities with a strong argument—that as the pro perty is registered in the name of the Sheikh’s son and family, and they are Turkish subjects, obviously the Sheikh recognizes himself and his property as entirely subjects to the Turkish Government, {d) that, after his death, the division of his property would present enormous difficulties and probably raise most undesirable questions if portions were found registered in the name of a son holding a Turkish nationality certificate, (e) that such a course might make it exceedingly difficult in the future for the British Government to render him that measure of assistance wffiich they would like and which he might possibly find himself in a position to require. I said that to my mind by far the best course now' was for him to ask Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas to make in writing to the Tapu Office formal application (wdiich is his duty under the terms of the sale-deeds) for registration of the transfer as soon as possible. If the registration is effected, well and good, while, if refused, the Sheikh would be in a much better position to know how the case stands either at Constantinople or with the Wali or both, and in any case could be no worse off than at present. 6. The Sheikh appeared to agree with my view but whether he will act as I su Sg es t e d I do not yet know. I shall take an opportunity of asking him in a few days and will then again report. I was at pains to explain that I was giving my own opinion only and to the best of my ability in the Sheikh’s own interests, and trust that the suggestion in the circumstances will meet with your approval.

When visiting me after his return from a trip up-river at which he had met the Wali of Basrah, the Sheikh informed me that he thought the case of this embankment had at last reached a conclusion. He said that the Wali and the Officer Commanding the troops at Basrah had both been to Fao, had told him that he was at liberty to repair the embankment whenever it should become necessary and had also given the Commandant of the Fao Fort strict injunctions that he should not again interfere with similar works on Sheikh Mubarak’s properties when they required repairs. win f'iiT _ 3 - There is a rumour also to the effect that the Turkish authorities do not | consider the fort of any military value and that the Wali has an idea that it would be of more use if demolished and converted into a school! “tiSii; ■It: Itai 4. Sheikh Mubarak said that during the year the soldiers had been annoying his men at Fao in petty ways, which he had not reported to us as they were of a trifling nature, but he now hoped that he would have no further trouble from the fort.

From various telegrams received from Cox, following appears to be the present position :— Crow and Wilson have discussed the reply, and the sheikh is willing to send it, hut claims that the vali should express regret, and give compensation for damage done to property. Vali, however, will not even apologise, except on instructions from the Porte. As regards the general merits of the case, Cox and Wilson warmly traverse Crow’s views that the grievances are wholly on the side of the Turks, and contend that the troubles on the river were due to Turkish [? arbitrary] maladministration, as has been repeatedly admitted in despatches from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, and that order has been mainly maintained by sheikh out of deference to us. They therefore hope that His Majesty’s Government will not take a definite decision until the sheikh’s case is before them. Cox again urges that if we do not obtain suitable amendments from the vali “ our influence and sheikh’s own prestige will be damaged beyond repair.” He also says that a settlement of the question would be made easier if the vali of Bussorah were detained at Bagdad. Cox is convinced that Turkish action against Mohammerah is preliminary to / activity as regards Xoweit. » | I am unwilling to express any opinion myself on the quarrel between the sheikh -and the vali, as I am still awaiting sheikh’s case.

H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. In continuation of the correspondence ending with my letter No. 288, dated I Letter No. G.-H, dated 6th (received 30th January 1910. I have the honour V / / 30th January 1910, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of the marginally noted letters on the subject of Shaikh Mubarak’s Fao properties, and of Shaikh Mubarak’s recent meet- (1) Letter No. C.-ll, dated 6th (received 15th) March 1910, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (2) Letter No. 14, dated 9th (received 15th) March 1910, from His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople. ing with the Wali of Basrah in connection therewith. 2 . The account of his trip given by Shaikh Mubarak to Captain Shakespear is very different from that given in Mr. Crow’s report. I have furnished Captain Shakespear with - a copy of Mr. Crow’s report and asked him to make further enquiries about the matter. It is, however, sufficiently evident that the Shaikh’s emphatic statement that “ not one word had been broached on the subject of his properties ” is not in accordance with fact. No doubt, however, the Shaikh does not for a moment think that we believe such assurances. 3. It is evident from Mr. Crow’s report that the new Wali of Basrah is trying to ingratiate himself with Shaikhs Khazal and Mubarak. It does not seem desir able from our point of view that the two chiefs should become too friendly with His Excellency, and I have asked His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah to be so good as to let me know if anything further transpires. It is very possible that Shaikh Khazal finding himself in opposition to the Bakhtiari (and most powerful) element in the Persian Government, may desire to make friends with the Turks, but it hardly seems likely that Shaikh Mubarak being on such friendly terms with Bin Saud could seriously contemplate any arrangement with the Turks. In fact, it seems possible that Shaikh Mubarak is merely trying to throw dust in the eyes of the Wali. 4. It appears that nothing was actually settled regarding the registration of the Fadaghia property, and in fact that no immediate settlement is likely. Any further information received will at once be reported to Government. No. C.-ll, dated Kuwait, the 6th March 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The First Assistant in charge of Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to report the following further particulars with reference to the correspondence ending with my letter, No. C.-7, dated the 18th January 1910, and my diary entries for February regarding Shaikh Mubarak’s recent visit toFao and Basrah. 2 . In conversation the Shaikh mentioned his visit to Fao, said that be had met the Wali there, and had then gone on to Basrah in his yacht, stayed a few days at Shaikh Khazal’s palace in Basrah and returned. On my enquiry whether anything had passed during the meeting as to the registration of his properties, he informed me with unusual emphasis that not a word had been broached on the subject, which was still in the position already reported in my letter referred to above. He added that the Wali had come down the river on tour and as he visited his estates at Fao he felt bound to be present. 3. The above gives the Shaikh’s version, but I heard on excellent authority what I believe to be more in consonance with the real facts, from an intimate friend of the Shaikh. The Wali, intending to visit Fao, summoned Shaikh Mubarak, and the latter left Kuwait in haste in the middle of his preparations for bis cam paign against the Ajman tribe. Calls were exchanged between the Shaikh and the Wali on board their respective vessels, and the Shaikh was also entertained at a2 dinner by the Wali. What passed between them exactly I am not aware, but the subject of the registration of his properties certainly came up and was settled sum marily by the Wali refusing even to discuss the question until Mubarak should first take out a Turkish nationality certificate. Subsequently the Shaikh went up to Basrah, and I am unable to say whether calls were again exchanged there, but I believe not, as I am informed that Shaikh Mubarak did not land at the serai (Government House) at Basrah. 4. It is significant that the Shaikh’s secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim, has been in Basrah some time now, though on what business I have no information, and that the Shaikh undoubtedly sought to deceive me as to what passed between him and the Wali. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to ask if be can furnish any further light on the subject. No. 14. 0 Sir, (Copy.) Basrah ; March 9th 1910. I have the honour to report that last month the Wali and the Commodore pro ceeded in the “ Marmaris ” to Fao and met Shaikh Mubarak and Shaikh Khazal at the house of Abdul Wahab el Kartass at Saraji a few miles from Basrah. The company were entertained at a banquet at which the proceedings were enlivened by the Turkish band. After the meal Abdul Wahab, the host, made a speech which has been reproduced in a local Arabic newspaper the “ Izhar-ul-Hakk.” The speaker after congratulating the Ottoman nation on acquiring freedom and a constitution, said no people had ever done so without gradually progressing to the attainment of the highest happiness, glory and prosperity, and he was convinced Turkey would do the same. He then declared that certain dishonest officials in the past, in order to serve their own ends, had succeeded in estranging Shaikh Mubarak Pasha, Kaimmakam of Kuwait, from his country and his Government and went on to eulogise the Shaikh in the following terms : - “ Who is Shaikh Mubarak Pasha as Sabah ? He is the free, faithful and zealous Ottoman now among us. Excellencies, we all know him well, and I need not detain you with an account of the Shaikh or his family, whose generous qualities have gained notoriety from the books of Midhat Pasha, the founder of our freedom, while more recently the Shaikh himself has become famous for the lavish manner in which he has contributed both money and assistance, as is attested by the official records of the Government.” The speaker concluded his address “ by attesting to the fact that throughout the course of past events and vicissitudes, the Shaikh has never wavered or changed in his allegiance and fidelity to the Ottoman Government and nation,” and ended by saying “ Long life to Shaikh Mubarak and our beloved neighbour, Sardar Arfa Khazal Khan, who,^ although a Persian by nationality, conducts himself like an Ottoman in his acts and contributes both efforts and money to the establishment of peace and good order in our dear native land and that more specially in the time of the present Wali. ” The party were then photographed, the Wali in the middle with Khazal on his right and Mubarak on his left, while the speaker, Kartass, stood in the foreground with his back to the camera. I called a few days ago on the author of the speech, ’Abdul Wahab al Kartass, who quite admitted that be had bis tongue in his cheek when he delivered it. Mr. Lyle of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., who visited the Shaikh at Kuwait shortly after his trip to Basrah, informed me that Mubarak had told him that theWali still refused to allow the registration of the transfer of the land he had pur chased at Fadagh ia unless he took out a certificate of Ottoman nationality. Abdul Wahab Pasha, however, gave me a somewhat different account of the matter. According to him, strict orders have been received from Constantinople not to per mit the registration of the transfer to Mubarak^at all. The reason for this oppo sition to what is really a very ordinary transaction is, so Abdul Wahab informs me, that a misconception exists at Constantinople regarding the situation of the land to be transferred, and that the Ministers believe it to occupy an important strategic position commanding Basrah, moreover, they do not think Mubarak is buying the land himself, but that the British Government are financing him in the matter. Abdul Wahab says the Wall had sent in very favourable reports, explaining bow erroneous all this is, but he has not succeeded in overcoming the opposition of the Ministers. As regards the question of the nufus tesTcere, Abdul Wahab told me this matter could easily be got over by the Shaikh putting the land in the name of bis blind son and taking out a certificate of Ottoman nationality for him in order to satisfy Turkish susceptibilities. I informed your Excellency in a previous despatch that Shaikh Mubarak proposed adopting this course when Major Knox and I discussed the matter with him last year at Kuwait. I do not myself think the Wali is as obligingly disposed to settle the question in the way the Shaikh suggests, as Abdul Wahab Pasha would have me believe. As the deputy Ahmed Pasha as Zobeir, the seller of the land, is at Constantinople, be could, no doubt, satisfy the Ministers as to the position of Fadaghia. I think they do not want to let Shaikh Mubarak acquire more ground here for purely political reasons, and the Wali, I think, is not likely to endeavour to induce them to change their minds as he fully appreciates the anomaly of the Shaikh’s position and loses no opportunity of having a dig at me about the Kuwait question. Your Excellency may have seen a statement in the Frankfurter Zeitung that Ahmed Pasha Zobeir had sold large tracts of land at Basrah to the British Government. An indignant denial of this was published by Zobeir’s brother, Abd-el-Mohsin, President of the Municipality, in the Basrah newspaper “Izhar-ul-Hakk,” but the statement, no doubt, refers to the present transaction and cannot but tend to increase Turkish suspicions. The Wali, however, practises the Turkish maxim about being affable to one’s friends and dissimulating with one’s enemies, and I hear Shaikh Mubarak has promised to assist him to get the stone required for his new road by using Kuwait boats to bring the material from Maskat, no charge being made for freight, but the Wali paying the cost of the labour employed. Whether the Kuwait fisher men will approve of this onerous arrangement is another question. In any case the Wali is cultivating good relations with his neighbours to some purpose and, as long as he continues on good terms with the powerful Shaikh of Muhammerah, it is unlikely there will be any armed disturbance in the Vilayet. There have been none of importance this winter. Early last month Falih es Seyhood, who is practically an outlaw, and who seems to have enlisted the good offices of Shaikh Khazal in order to effect a reconciliation with the Vali, came from Muhammerah where he has been staying to Basrah, and asked for pardon, saying he was ready to pay arrears of taxes due and to give up the rifles of his Arabs to the Turkish Government, to which he expressed his loyalty. The Wali com municated his application to the Minister of the Interior, but I have not heard with what result. Falih returned to Muhammerah, the Wali having given him to understand that he would be arrested if he remained here longer than twenty-four hours. Shaikh Khazal has on his side reciprocated by maintaining a conciliatory attitude tbwards the Wali since his arrival and has not opposed the partial des truction of his house property on the Ashar creek road, which is included in the municipal scheme now being carried out by the Wali of widening the road and laying down a tramway to Basrah. Shaikh Khazal’s agent, Mirza Hamza, called on me and made some enquiries as to my own attitude in regard to the properties of the Bohra and Khoja communities on the road which were being partly pulled down. I told Mirza Hamza that I had been in correspondence with Constantinople on the subject, and His Majesty’s Embassy saw no reason to interfere with the execution of the Wali’s project, and that I had received instructions as to thelimits within which the authorities could claim compliance with their designs without payment and the nature of the compensation which could be demanded under the regulations. The Shaikh’s agent took note of the date of the Building law, and I noticed that work was begun on his houses on the following day. To I have, etc., (Sd.) F. E. CROW.

IIN your despatch No. 439 of the 22nd October, 1908, you requested that I should propose to the Ottoman Government an arbitration to decide on the claim of the Sheikh or Ivoweit to certain property at lao, leaving, however, the selection of a suitable moment for making the proposal to my discretion. I regret to have to state that no favourable opportunity for such a step has yet presented itself, nor does the idea seem feasible under the altered conditions in lurkey. Am interpellation of several of the Ministers has been announced on the subject of the Bagdad Railway Concession, though for one reason or another it has, so far, on each occasion been postponed. Attached to this have been questions regarding the rights of Russia to railway construction in the Black Sea basin, and regarding the status of Koweit, which latter the late Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me he would nave no _ difficulty in avoiding by the statement that it was a matter the discussion of which was undesirable for reasons of State. The press has also several times referred to alleged British encroachments at Jloweit, once undoubtedly at German (or Austrian) instigation. Only two days ago the bhura-nummet, m commenting on international politics, attributed the satisfaction or England with the establishment of the Constitution here to the prospect of its interfering with Germany s commercial privileges in Turkey, and instanced the appearance of the Koweit question simultaneously with the grant of the Bagdad Railway Concession as a proof of this. It will be necessary to treat the matter with great caution, and it would probably be best to allow it to_ remain dormant for the present at all events, if indeed the Turks on then side allow it to remain so. It must be very carefully borne in mind that iurkish rights and claims bear a very different complexion now from [what they did undei the old regime, and will need to be treated with great circumspection so long as t e new oidei of things lasts, or at all events until we see clearly the groove into which the new regime will settle.

No. G.- 7 , dated Koweit, the 18 th January 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespeae, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The iirst Assistant Resident in charge of the Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 2667, dated the '24th October 1909, regarding the claim advanced by the Turkish authorities for the registration of Sheikh Mubarak as an Ottoman subject as a proceeding necessary to the legal transfer of landed property purchased by him. . 2 ‘ I 11 m y letter No. 444, dated the 7th August 1909, I reported that the Sheikh was inclined to leave matters in status quo and that the new Wali, an Arab by name Sayid Arif Bey, was not hostile, whilst the question of Sheikh Mubarak’s registration as a Turkish subject had not been pressed. 3. I would now cast back to the purchase in February 1909 by Sheikh Mubarak of what is known as the Fadliagiya property of the az-Zuhair family, and would observe that this letter deals with the registration question arising put of the purchase of that property alone and not with the Sheikh’s Fao estates. In recent conversations the Sheikh mentioned that the Turkish officials were not as complacent as formerly towards him and his properties and eventually he furnished me with copies (I have not seen the originals) of the sale-deeds of the Fadhagiya property, and it will suffice if the following points from them are noted:— ° 1 (a) That the Fadhagiya property was shared by various members of the az-Zuhair family and therefore four separate sale-deeds became necessary. (b) That the purchase by Sheikh Mubarak was completed on the 21st Mohurrum 1327(=14th February 1909), part of the price being paid on the spot in cash and part by drafts due at various dates, which the Sheikh informs me have all since been cashed. (c) That one Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas acted in all except one case as the attorney of the vendors. (d) That in each sale-deed is contained a condition that the vendor or his attorney, Abdul Wahab, shall arrange for the necessary transfers in the registers of the Land Revenue Office (the Tanu Office) of the Basrah Yilayet. (e) That Sheikh Mubarak entered into possession from the date of the purchase. 4. It appears that immediately after the sale, which took place in the time of Mahrum Effendi as Wali, Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas applied for the necessary transfer in the Land Registers to be made to Sheikh Mubarak’s name. The transfer was refused by the Superintendent of the Tapu Office and Abdul Wahab accordingly on the 9th Shabat 1324 (22nd February 1909) complained by letter to the Wali of his subordinate’s dilatoriness. From a copy (which the ✓Sheikh has apparently succeeded in securing) of the orders and remarks passed on this petition, it appears that the Wali, Mahrum Effendi, forwarded the petition for remarks to the subordinate concerned, who replied on the same date that a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior at Constantinople prohibited the transfer pending further orders, to which the Wali appended the equivalent of our routine official remark ‘ Noted Sheikh Mubarak’s explanation of this telegram is that Mahrum Effendi was inimical to him and hearing of his intended purchase of the Eadhagiya property telegraphed to Constantinople that the purchase was being made by Mubarak with British gold, and it was upon this falsehood that the Ministry of the Interior telegraphed the order to delay the completion of the sale. This delay was effected at Basrah by a refusal to register the land-transfer unless Sheikh Mubarak took out a Nationality certificate labelling him as a Turkish subject. The means of salvation were communicated to Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas, but he on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak at once said that such a course was unprecedented in the case of any well-known merchant or large landowner in Basrah and much less to be contemplated in the case of an influential Sheikh of Mubarak’s position who moreover held many other acres on the Shatt-el-Arab and had never hitherto been requested to conform to a regulation which was enforced but seldom and then only in the case of petty nobodies. 5. Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas continued trying at intervals to effect the transfer and Sayid Arif Bey, the Arab who succeeded Mahrum Effendi as Wali in May 1909, endeavoured to help him by getting the earlier order cancelled at Constantinople. Nothing however resulted, and Arif Bey was in turn succeeded in October 1909 by Suliman Nathif Pasha, the present Wali. Abdul Wahab addressed himself to the newcomer at the first opportunity and was told at once and very plainly that no transfer would be made until Mubarak had duly registered himself as an Ottoman subject. 6. Nothing further has happened and now, a year after Sheikh Mubarak took possession of the property, the price has been paid up in full, Mubarak pays the taxes, but the property still stands in the name of the az-Zuhair family and so far as the Turkish authorities and Courts are concerned is still their property. 7. Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair, who is the head of the family and represents Basrah in the new Turkish Parliament, promised his good offices in Constanti nople, but from his efforts, if indeed any were made, nothing has hitherto resulted, and as Sheikh Mubarak pointed out “he has received his money, why should he trouble further about the purchaser and the property.” 8. Sheikh Mubarak now feels that he can do no more to settle the matter himself, that there is no hope of changing the present Wali’s (Suliman Nathif Pasha’s) attitude, and therefore requests that His Majesty’s Ambassador in Constantinople may he urged to take up the cudgels for him to obtain either a rescission of the previous orders or a definite exemption from the necessity for registration either of his property or his person as Turkish. 9. The above gives the story of the Sheikh’s difficulties from his point of view and much of the ground has already been covered in Mr. Consul Crow’s two despatches to Sir Gerald Lowther, dated the 12th Eebruary and 12th July 1909, though from a different aspect. 10. Erom the previous correspondence on the subject it will be apparent that, in spite of the Sheikh’s local efforts, Mr. Consul Crow’s endeavours, and the late Wali Arif Bey’s assistance, the demand for Turkish registration still continues. The question is a most important one as affecting the whole status of Koweit and one which would appear now to be capable of solution only in Constantinople or London. The Sheikh informed me that only one Koweiti has so far taken out a Turkish certificate of nationality, Hamid al-Khalid, / I whose case was reported in my predecessor’s letter No. 48 of the 27th January Mh] I 1909. The Padhagiya property sale-deeds stand in the Sheikh’s own name, but 1 he informed me that the property known as Mutawiya, which he purchased from Sheikh Sadun of the Muniifich, stands in the names of Hamid-al-Khalid and the Sheikh’s sons, Jabir, Salim and Hamed bin Mobarak. The transfer of this Mutawiya property was duly registered in the Tapu Office records, nodifficulty being made presumably because Hamid-al-Khalid bad already taken out a Nationality certificate. The Sheikh said that his sons had not taken out certificates as is suggested likely in Mr. Crow’s despatches quoted above. 11. In discussing the matter, I informed the Sheikh that before His Majesty’s Ambassador could even be asked to move on his behalf the very fullest information would be necessary, and seeing that all local efforts had apparently been unsuccessful it would be advisable to obtain from Constanti nople, perhaps through Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair, details of what had passed there •with regard to the matter. The Sheikh agreed to try and obtain the further information. 12. Meanwhile this report of the present situation is forwarded with the hope that Government being put in possession of all that is available may be able to re-examine a question which presents a very thorny problem and which will require a solution if the independence of the Paler of Koweit is to mean anything more than the inaccessibility or freedom of his port from Turkish aggression and, it may be added, if our position in Koweit is to be made secure from incessant Turkish intrigue.'VOXNo. 2080, dated Bushire, the 22nd (received 30th) August 1909 (Confidential)^!.

In amplification of my telegram No. 833, dated the 17th August I have the honour to state that I met Sheikh Mubarak at Mohammerah on my return journey from Ahwaz on 17th July. He then told me that the Fort authorities at Fao were worrying him again about the boundary of his properties and he thought he should have to trouble us again, but that as regards the registration question he had managed to put through the purchase of the Fadaghia property without registering and he would not dream of doing so. He continued that he was about to meet the new Wali in company with Sheikh Khazal and the Nakib of Basrah and he would know better then what the outlook was. I may mention that Sheikh Khazal had confided in me at Mohammerah a few days before that if ultimately pressed seriously in the matter of registration, Sheikh Mubarak intended to qualify by registering the name of a young son who is blind or non compos, and who “ could not be of use to anybody ”1 Sheikh Mubarak, whom I sounded on the point, repudiated any idea of the kind, but I have no doubt that what Sheikh Khazal told me was well founded. Sheikh Mubarak has now returned home and I attach a report received by Koweit Agency No. 444 , dated the 7 th August 1909 . th ®. ^ fr0m th , e Pofifical Agent, from which it appears that it is unnecessary at present for any representation to be made to the Porte.

I visited the Sheikh the day after his return and in the course of a long conversation he informed me that his affairs on the Shatt-el-Arab for the time being were progressing as smoothly as could be expected, and that the new Wali, who is an Arab, was not inclined, at least for the present, to be actively hostile. 3. He had met the new Wali at an entertainment given by the Nakib of Basrah at Sabailiyah but that nothing of an intimate or private nature had either passed or been possible between them regarding his properties. 4. The Sheikh added that the question of land registration had not been pressed and that he had not registered in the case of the Fadhagyia property nor did he ever contemplate doing so. Though I could obtain nothing very definite from the Sheikh, I gathered that for the present his relations with the Turkish officials were comparatively friendly, and he was inclined to leave matters as they are for fear that any representations to the Porte might result in the re-opening of undesirable questions. 5. I enquired whether he had noticed if the overthrow of the old regime in Constantinople had yet produced any concomitant effect in the Basrah Vilayet and what he anticipated the reflective result would be on his own affairs. The Sheikh replied that so far no change was apparent in Basrah and so far as he was concerned personally he expected none; that for the time being the Turks were not molesting him, but he had no doubt that, when it suited their purpose, they would re-commence their policy of interference in his affairs, and that they would never forgive him for having allied himself to British interests. 6. In the circumstances it would appear that no representations to the Porte are immediately called for. 7^3 | 3 /^) G, C. B. P., Simla.—No. C-07J7 F. D.—10-9- 09.—39.—E. A. D’S.[This Documei.t is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] uespaicnes wmcn I have received irom His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah. reporting on the difficulties raised by the vali with regard to the registration of a certain property at h edaghia in the name of the Sheikh of Koweit. The objections raised by / the vah were, as you are aware, on the ground that Sheikh Mubarek must first take out an Ottoman teskereh as a Turkish subject. Influence is, however, being brought to bear on the Council of Ministers to have these objections removed, and the vali himself has promised Mr. Crow to do what he can in the matter. The question is, I may add, a different one from that of the Fao lands near the fort of Howeit, which was settled satisfactorily a few months ago, as reported in my despatch No.TlDG of the 28th May last. WITH reference to my telegrams No. 67 of the 29th December, No. 2 of the 8th January, and No. 3 of the 9th January last, I have the honour to report that I proceeded, to Koweit on the 29th ultimo by sea, my departure having been delayed two days in consequence of the weather, and returned overland on the 11th instant. Major Knox was good enough to place his steam launch at my disposal, and Sheikh Mubarek provided me with camels for the return journey. As already reported by telegraph, my journey was in connection with the difficulties raised by the vali in regard to the transfer of the property of Fedaghia, situated in the kaza of Fao, and consisting of 430 jereebs (about 415 acres) of land lately purchased by Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit from Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir for £ T. 48,706. The vali would not allow the transfer to be made unless he, the sheikh, registered himself as an Ottoman subject. What the vali actually said when remonstrated with was that the person who wanted the transfer must produce papers of nationality, and, if an Arab, he must produce papers of Turkish nationality. In accordance with your Excellency’s instructions, ! suggested to the vali that “ nationality—Koweit” on the transfer might be accepted in place of “ Ottoman subject,” but his Excellency refused to entertain the suggestion, and insisted on the sheikh describing himself as a Turkish subject in the transfer papers, and on his taking out a nufuss teskereh as well. At the desire of the sheikh two preliminary agreements respecting the sale of the Fedaghia land were drawn up, one copy of which, signed by Abdul Wahab Kirtas, as representative of the sellers, Zoheir Pasha and his wife, -was executed in my presence at Bussorah and witnessed by a number of the Bussorah notables; the other copy in blank being handed to me to deliver to Sheikh Mubarek at Koweit for his signature and legalisation by His Majesty’s political agent at Koweit. These documents, duly executed, record the fact of the sale having taken place and the receipt of the money, and are good and binding as between the parties themselves. They would form a basis for arbitration should occasion arise, but they would have no validity in the courts of the Sheriat, nor would they, it appears, operate as a legal transfer of the land or take the place of the usual proceedings at the Tapoo Office, which are left over for completion until the vali’s opposition in the matter can be overcome. 1 took the duplicate agreement to Koweit with me for signature as described, and I have, &amp;c. GEBAKD LOWTHEB, Inclosure 1 in No. 1. (No. 6.) Sir, Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. Bussorah, February 12, 1909. availed myself of the opportunity to discuss the whole question with Major Knox and [2378 6]2 the sheikh himself. It would appear that the vali s opposition is premeditated, and goes to the root of the whole matter. His _ Excellency has, according to Sheikh Mubarek, again raised the question of Koweitis who reside and trade at Bussorah taking out certificates of Turkish nationality before their claims or complaints an entertained by the vali or the courts. In July 1907 Sheikh Mubarek appears to ha \ reported to His Majesty’s political agent that the then Vali of Bussorah, Hassan Bey, had notified certain Koweit merchants trading at Bussorah to register themselves as Ottoman subjects under penalty of expulsion if they refused The merchant interested, however, left Bussorah of his own accord, and the matter dropped. _ Sheikh Mubarek also complained of the treatment accorded to Hammad-el-Khalid, a rich pearl merchant of Koweit, who sought to recover £ T. 1,000 at Bussorah. The vali, according to the sheikh, insisted on the man registering himself as an Ottoman subject before enter taining the claim, and it seems that he acceded to this demand in order to recover his debt. Major Knox is of opinion that Khalid was probably instructed by the sheikh to take out the nufuss teskereh with a view to bringing about our interference, and so obtain the issue of instructions to the vali which would assist the Tapoo operations in connection with the transfer of the Fedaghia property, in which the sheikh himself is deeply interested. The vali also wrote to Sheikh Mubarek, so the latter informed us, inviting him to send a deputy to the Turkish Parliament, but the sheikh had not yet answered the letter. The vali is undoubtedly doing his best to disturb the status quo previously arranged between His Majesty’s Government and the Sublime Porte in regard to the Koweit question, and it is unlikely he will be induced to modify his attitude by 7 any arguments of mine without special instructions from Constantinople. Moreover, in view of your Excellency’s telegram of the 2nd January, in which you say it would be inexpedient to raise the Koweit question at present, I hesitate to approach the vali directly on the subject without your Excellency’s instructions, as in view of his general attitude and his recent action in regard to Tapoo proceedings it would be difficult to do so without going into the whole question. It would perhaps tide over the difficulty if the vali could be instructed to'grant facilities to the sheikh for the transfer of his property in the present instance, failing which it seems not improbable that the sheikh may cause the land to be registered in the names of his sons, and direct them to take out certificates of Turkish nationality for the purpose. In the course of a conversation which Major Knox and I had with the sheikh, I gathered that the latter entertained no great objection himself to such a proceeding, but I presume it would be against our interests to permit him to do so in view of the complications it might lead to after his death. It would certainly strengthen the contention of the Turks that Koweit belongs to them. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 42.) Sir, Bussorah, July 12, 1909. IN conversation yesterday with the vali I referred to the registration of the Sheikh of Koweit’s land at Fedaghia purchased from Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir, to which the late vali, Moharrem Effendi, had raised objections on the ground that Sheikh Mubarek must take out an Ottoman teskereh as a Turkish subject first, and I pointed I out that the sheikh was already the holder of large estates in the vilayet, which had been I registered previously in his name without this difficulty. I said the teskereh precaution seemed to be superfluous and meaningless, as according to the convention of 186/ foreigners could acquire land in Turkey, and that the arrangement entailed their assimilation to Ottoman subjects. His Excellency agreed, and said that Moharrem Effendi had blundered, but that the real difficulty arose from the matter having been misunderstood at the Sublime Porte, which imagined that the transfer referred to large tracts of Government land at Ghermet Ali claimed by Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir, and regarding which litigation was proceeding between the latter and the Ottoman Govern ment. The vali said he was in communication with Constantinople on the subject, and hoped to settle the question shortly. He added, however, that Sheikh Mubarek desired the land registered in the name of one of his sons, and had offered no objectionto his taking out an Ottoman teskereh for the purpose, though he seemed to shrink from letting him appear personally at Bussorah to complete the formality. I said I hoped his Excellency would endeavour to smooth over the difficulty, and let the sheikh register his land at Fedaghia in the same way as his other properties, the vali promised me to do what he could in the matter. This is the first I have heard of the Fedaghia property being mistaken for that of Ghermet Ali. They have of course nothing to do with one another, and are situated in totally different parts of the district. I am informed privately that Ahmed Pasha- es-Zoheir and his family have been in possession of property at Ghermet Ali for many years, and hold the title-deeds of the land. There is great enmity between his family and that of the nakib, with whom the vali is at present very friendly, and the claim now put forward to this property by the Government seems to be the result of an intrigue on the part of Seyyid Talib, the nakib’s son. It is possible the vali may have wished to mislead me, for it is quite certain that the Porte laid great stress on Mubarek- es-Sabah taking out a teskereh of Ottoman nationality, and gave orders to hold over the registration of the transfer of Fedaghia until the formality was completed. I am also informed that Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir has been endeavouring to settle the matter through the Council of State at Constantinople, and that he telegraphed recently that instructions were being sent to the vali to permit the registration of the transfer. The vali made no allusion to this in his conversation with me yesterday. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW.6.

I have the honour to refer to Major Knox’s letter No. 6, dated 4th Janu- * (Paragraph 4.) ary,* a copy of which was forwarded with my letter of 5th February to your address on the subject of the request of Sheikh Mubarak for a loan. 2. While in Calcutta, I communicated to you the purport of Consul Crow’s telegram to me of 9th January (copy attached) and noted on it that Sheikh Mubarak would probably manage to get round the registration diffi culty by using a proxy and effecting a “ benami ” transaction, if I may use an Indian term, I added that pending further news from Koweit no action seemed necessary. 3. On my return to headquarters, three further reports from Major Knox have been placed before me, dealing with the same subject, namely, the activity of the new Wali of Basrah in obliging Koweitis to register as Ottoman subjects. Copies of them accompany. It is only to be expected that the Porte should object, as the Persian Government does, to foreign nationalists possessing landed property in the country, and conversely should insist, in cases where they do so possess pro perty, on their agreeing to be amenable in respect of such property to the local Courts, and to refrain from invoking protection from capitulations; but this end can be attained, and is, in Persia, without any condition of indepen dent registration, and for this demand, apparently a new one, there seems no manner of justification. It can only he presumed that it is the outcome of the personal attitude of the present Wali, who has evinced several signs of aggres sive activity in such directions—(for instance in connection with the affairs of Wakra)—which, if it cannot be checked, is calculated to give us a good deal of inconvenience in these waters. 4. I venture to hope that the Government of India will see grounds in the accompanying reports, for moving His Majesty’s Government to take such steps in the direction of representation to the Porte, as will induce the latter to discontinue this demand for the independent registration of Koweitis as Turkish subjects, and bring about an improvement of the attitude of their present Wali at Basrah, Telegram P., dated nil (received 9 th January 1909 ). From—The Consul, Basrah, To—The Resident, Bushire. I have been privately informed that the Turkish authorities refuse to register the transfer of the land recently purchased by the Sheikh of Koweit unless he is described on the transfer papers as an Ottoman subject. The Wali is obdurate, and the Embassy has wired that the raising of the Koweit question is inexpedient. . -No complaint has been received from Koweit, but as the matter is important will you please inform the Resident. No. 48 , dated Koweit, the 27 th January 1909 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that I visited Sheikh Mubarak this morning, and he at once opened the conversation with complaints regarding the conduct r2 of His Excellency the Wali of Basrah, who, it appears, has been again agitatin* with some vigour the question of Koweit subjects living or trading in Basrah taking out certidcates of Turkish nationality before their claims or complaints are entertained either by His Excellency or the Turkish Courts. &lt; 2. It will, no doubt, he fresh in your recollection that, at the time of your recent visit here, in the close of Decern her last, Sheikh Mubarak was anxious about the completion of his purchase of the Eadhagiya property, and informed both you and myself that His Excellency was putting difficulties in the way and insisting on his taking out a certificate of Turkish nationality, and that one of the principal objects of my visit to Basrah was to consult with Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar, the Sheikh’s agent, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah with regard to this very question. 3. I found His Britannic Majesty’s Consul distinctly averse to Sheikh Mubarak taking out a certificate of Turkish nationality at any rate on this account, and disapproving generally of His Excellency the Wali’s attitude on this question, as it would appear that His Excellency has also been giving trouble of a similar kind to British subjects, proprietors of land in Turkish territory. His Excellency’s attitude appeared, so I understood, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul of doubtful legality and, with special reference to Eoweit, calculated to raise inconvenient questions better left undisturbed. 4. Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin B:idar was distinctly hopeful that the 'Wali was weakening in his opposition to the sale, and that the matter would be eventually adjusted to Sheikh Mubarak’s satisfaction. 5. It would now appear from Sheikh Mubarak’s latest conversation with me on the subject that Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar was too sanguine, and that the question of certificates of Turkish nationality is being raised in an acute form. 6 This form is, however, not altogether novel and was reported in my letter No. 396, dated the 26th July 1907, to your address, when Sheikh Mubarak reported that certain Koweit merchants trading in Basrah had been warned by the then Wali of Basrah to take out certificates of Turkish nation ality or they would be expelled the town. Sheikh Mubarak’s information was at the time too vague and scanty for any further action to be taken thereon and the matter came to rest of itself, as the especial merchant of whom mention was made, Isa bin Abdul Jalil, left Basrah to suit his own convenience, and no further questions were asked about him. 7. Sheikh Mubarak now informs me that one Hammad al Khalid, a member of the firm of Al Khathair, one of our biggest pearl merchants, had a claim of £T1,000, which he sought to bring before His Excellency the TVali of Basrah for redress. His Excellency absolutely refused to entertain the claims, until Hammad took out a certificate of Turkish nationality. Hammad, so it is reported, took out the certificate, as otherwise he would have been unable to recover the debt. 8. Sheikh Mubarak professes to regard Hammad’s action with disapproval* He referred me for details of the case to Hammad’s brother, Fahad al Khalid, and asked me to tell Fahad al Khalid, who is a personal friend of mine, that Hammad’s action was ill-advised and calculated to prejudice the position of all Koweit merchants trading up Basrah way. 9. I declined to administer this rebuff to my friend, Fahad al Khalid, oa the two grounds (1) that I was not aware what view would be taken by my superior officers of Hammad’s action, and (2) that I had no authority whatever to control the actions or comment on the conduct of Arab merchants trading in Basrah, and the Sheikh, laughing, admitted the reasonableness of my contention. 10. Personally, I am inclined to doubt whether Hammad took out the certificate of Turkish nationality without the Sheikh’s approval, and am of the opinion that he was probably directed to do so in the .hope that his action might induce the British Embassy to interfere and procure the issue of instructions to His Excellency the 'Wali of Basrah not to disturb the s'at us quo,and thus ease the completion of the Fadhagiya sale, which is what Mubarak really has at heart. 11 . To bring the history of the Fadhagiya case up to date, I have the honour to place on record the fact that, at Sheikh Mubarak’s request, on the 22 nd instant, I addressed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah privately, informing him that His Excellency, the Wali, continued to throw obstacles in the way of the completion of the sale of the Fadhagiya property, that Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar had been instructed by Sheikh Mubarak to prepare a Moqawala or preliminary contract of sale, to have it signed by the chief notables of Basrah and then present it to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, in order that the latter might witness the document. I trusted that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul would see his way to comply with this request, as Sheikh Mubarak was of the opinion that His Excellency the Wall would probably then withdraw his opposition. 12 . It may also be of interest to record that I have been informed that the Fadhagiya property may give rise to inconvenient questions in the future as there is an awkward claim of Waqaf that hangs over the property. It appears that the original Fadhagiya property was undoubtedly Mowkouf to the Haramain on the failure of natural heirs by the will of the first holder. The property now sold to Mubarak is part of the alluvial soil thrown up by the Sbatt-el-Arab around the original property, and the contention of the seller, Ahmed az Zahair and other owners of the alluvial soil, is that only the original strip of land is Mowkouf and that the accretions can form the subject of sale or transfer. To this the claimants on behalf of the Wakaf reply that alluvial soil follows the land adjoining, and that, in any case, the date trees on the alluvial soil are offsets from the Wakaf property, and therefore Mowkouf. There is thus all the room for a cause celebre in which the Turkish courts' and lawyers would revel, over the alluvial soil, and it is alleged that this explains Ahmed Pasha az Zahair’s wish to get rid of the land. 13 . I shall endeavour to procure, as Sheikh Mubarak suggests, the details of this particular case from Fahad al Khalid and will forward them without delay. I further anticipate considerable benefit from the approaching visit of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, to Koweit to discuss this and pending questions but, in the meantime, I would suggest, with all deference, for your consideration, whether it would not be possible for higher authority to intimate through the usual channels, to His Majesty’s 3 Embassy at Constantinople that His Excellency the Wali of Basrah appears to be raisin^ in an acute form the question of the nationality of the people of Koweit more especially in regard to the purchase by Sheikh Mubarak of the Fadha^iya property from Ahmed Pasha az Zabair, that his activity in this matter appears to be a departure from the maintenance of the status quo, which it is the clearly expresssed object of both Governments to observe, and that it is further calculated to disturb the existing harmonious relations between Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit and the local Ottoman authorities of Basrah and that such a disturbance would he greatly regretted by His Britannic Majesty’s Government. If general instructions could be sent to His Excellency to deal with Koweit claims and cases without insisting on a precise definition of the petitioner’s status or nationality, all that Sheikh Mubarak is contending for would probably be obtained. &amp; No. 55, dated Koweit, the 1st February 1909 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 48 , dated the 27 th January 1909 I have the honour to report that His Britannic Majesty’s Consol, Basrah arrived here on the 30 th January, and we have had frequent opportunities of ’ discuss ing fully the ^ question of the taking out of certificates oP Turkish nationality by Koweit subjects temporarily residing or owning land within the limits of the Basrah M alayaU , * uc2. As regards the special case of Ilammad al Khathair, 'Fahadal Kkalidal Xhatbair had little to tell me and could only corroborate the fact that Hammad had taken out a certificate of Turkish nationality as he had no other way of recovering his debt. Fahad al Khalid did his best, however, to impress on me that 'this action of Hammad was only taken under pressure and laid much stress on the difficulty that the other members of the family would have, in the event of disagreement, in establishing their claim in Turkish courts to a share in any property which Hammad might acquire on behalf of the firm or family (the two terms are interchangeable) of Al Khathair. The Turkish courts would undoubtedly now regard Hammad as sole owner, unless all the family took out similar certificates which they were not prepared to do. 3. From the explanation given by Mr. Crow of the Turkish action, it would appear that their claim is now far more reasonable than was represented by me in my last letter and perhaps in consequence more difficult to combat successfully. 4. Briefly stated, it amounts to this, that, in all transactions before the Turkish Courts, the claimants’ nationality must be precisely defined before the claim is proceeded with, and His Excellency, the Wali, has further stated that, in the matter of land registration, as regards all Arabs, only Turkish nationality will be accepted. An informal attempt by Mr. Crow before his visit here to induce His Excellency to accept Koweit nationality as sufficiently precise failed. 5. Mr. Consul Crow brought with him from Basrah the draft of the Maqa- wala, referred to in paragraph 11 of my letter quoted above. It has been signed by Sheikh Mubarak, and the Sheikh’s signature has been verified by me. I have the honour to enclose a translation of the document. 6. It is, I venture to think, obvious that His Excellency’s action, while purporting to be of general application, is really directed at Koweit and cal culated to reopen, at an inopportune moment, the whole vexed question of the status of the inhabitants of Koweit. 7. While it might be considered that there is no special objection to Koweit subjects, taking out certificates of Turkish nationality for the purpose of land or business transactions at Basrah, as we have not so far professed to give them anything beyond good offices in Turkish territory, if we fail to sup port Sheikh Mubarak and his subjects at this juncture, the Sheikh at least will consider that his statement that we do not sufficiently protect his interests, is abundantly justified.

There is no other and the total exchange for this sold land is £T48,*706 and a half and three garsh and 30 paras. There is no other. And I have received of this account from the hand of His Highness, Sheikh Mubarak, the purchaser, mentioned above, only eleven thousand Turkish Hiras, counted, and in cash, and by drafts; and I have given him time for the remainder in exchange for the aforesaid sold property up to three months according to the sanad written by His Highness to my order against himself. And all the pieces of date garden with them surroundings, set forth above, have become property of the properties of His Highness, Sheikh Mubarak of the al Subah. He may enjoy them with the enjoyment of the proprietor and possessor of right in those rights without quarrelling or inter ference. And, from the date of its the name of my two principals in these properties in the rules of the Daftar al Khakani both names and registration have become since naked {i.e., void) ; the true- proprietor and enjoyer, accord ing to Muhammadan law, in the aforesaid lands, is His Highness, Sheikh Mubarak Pasha, aforesaid mentioned, and there does not remain to any body of my principals, aforesaid mentioned, in these pieces, neither right nor shadow of right. And that I promise and undertake that I will carry through the business of writing and setting free in the routine of the Daftar al Khakani at Basrah in the name of the aforesaid Sheikh, or in the name of him whom he may order at demand. And that I, Mubarak us Subah, have accepted the aforesaid sale, agreed between myself and the agent of the two sellers, of whom mendon is made above, with the answering and consent according to Shariat as a sale and acceptance finally, and universally completely free from all after thought and condition and deceit and repetition; and the two sellers aforesaid have become proprietors of the price of the property sold. And certainly I, up to this date, have not paid from the aforesaid price except eleven thousand lurkish Liras. No other. And uhe balance of the price of the sale, although there has been *a period granted me for three months from this date, certainly whatever is ready with me of the instalments, I shall hand it over to Abdul Wahab Pasha, the aforesaid. And I shall take from him a clear receipt for the amountof the money, and these receipts will be deductions from the total of the real sanad written by me to the order of Abdul Wahab Pasha, as it has been mentioned above. And certainly the area of the land and the surrounding of which the quantity has been set forth, as a total, is completely suitable to the measuremmt which the people of information, appointed and reliable in mv sight, carried out, and upon it has the agreement been fixed, and the sale is a true one, and has been completed between the two parties. Then there is no (room for) talk nor spoiling. And it is certainly necessary that all the ex penses and the taxes of Government for the performance of the business of the registration and the freeing return upon me and there is nothing of them on the sellers. And if there is delay in the progressing of the business aforesaid that will be no reason of the reasons to injure what has been fixed by this agreement; and we, the two parties, who have drawn up this agreement have agreed and promised that if there fell any abstention or contrariety between us in the matter of this agreement, then we shall be compelled that we shall settle between us three men of the most excellent Mussulmen for the seitle ment between us of every kind of contrariety and for the sake of strengthen ing and the issuing of the matters settled by ihis agreement and the settlement which is given from them in the agreement, or in the multiplication shall be a universal settlement upon us without necessity for the reference and wei-hin- and taat who goes out from it is contrary to his promises contained in this agreement then be shall be compelled with the punishment of damages and expenses of the other without necessity for a complaint or lawsuit.

I note that you instruct me to take a suitable opportunity to make it clear to the lurkish Government that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government regarding the status of Koweit has not been modified since the occurrence of the recent consti tutional changes in the Ottoman Empire, but in this respect I beg to call your attention to my despatch No. 138 of the 28th February last. v There exists, of course, as was pointed out by Lord Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21 st March, 1902, considerable doubt as the what is the precise status-quo in Koweit, and at that time, when both parties expressed their maintenance of\it, it appeared as if both placed their own interpretation on the phrase. It would be possible to inform the Turkish Government that His Majesty’s Government have not modified their attitude as to the status of Koweit, and the Turkish Government might answer that neitheiGiad they, but the matter would not be advanced thereby. On the other hand, there is the possibility that they might asseverate that His Majesty’s Government : had modified their attitude in that they had, in 1907, obtained a perpetual lease of the ! Bunder Shweikh land, &amp;c., knowledge of which, as shown in my despatch above mentioned, appears to have leaked out and arrived at the cognisance of the Ottoman Government. They are in a position to state that this is subsequent to any declarations concerning the status quo, and they might, quite conceivably, be disposed to view the However this may be, the Turkish Government is too much occupied at present with the problems or the reorganisation of the administration; and it would seem advisable to leave the question of the status of Koweit alone till such time as they shall find themselves in a position to enter upon a discussion of the principle involved, when it is probable that their views will depend largely upon the success with which their efforts at the regeneration of the Government of the country will have met. In the meantime I have the honour to transmit to you a copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bussorah, in which, in continuation of his despatch forwarded in my Nd?H70 of the 10 th March last, he reports the successful settlement by Sheikh Mubarek of the question of his irrigation scheme at Fao, and I desire particularly to call your attention to Mr. Crow’s observation that, according to his experience, the sheikh can manage his own business far better than we can, and that these difficulties settle themselves if left alone.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. T. 100 of the 9 th March on the subject of the Fao embankment question. 1 enquired yesterday from Sheikh Mubarek how it was that the Fao authorities had withdrawn their opposition to the repair of the embankment in question, and reminded the sheikh that the matter was under reference to our embassy at Constantinople, and that it was important that his Excellency should be kept informed of all develop ments. The sheikh replied that it was principally due to the changes among the military authorities at Bussorah. He had, through Kassim-el-Khederi (agent of the Bombay and Persian line), approached the new ferik, Yousuf Pasha, with a request to be allowed to put pipes into the plantation behind the enclosed ground that formed the subject of dispute, representing that owing to the destruction of the embankment the plantation behind it was endangered. Yousuf Pasha did more than he was asked to. He suggested that Sheikh Mubarek should repair the old embankment and plant it, thereby ceding all that had ever been in dispute. He sent a yuzbashi down to see that no one interfered with the execution of the work, which was carried out, according to Sheikh Mubarek, unknown to the civil authorities of either Fao or Bussorah. Sheikh Mubarek explained to me that the predecessor of Yousuf Pasha, Tahir Pasha, was not actively hostile to Mubarek’s execution of the work, and even assisted the sheikh by letters addressed to the Yali of Bussorah. It will, however, be remembered that His Majesty’s acting consul, Mr. Geary, at my visit to Bussorah in July last, came to a very different conclusion regarding the attitude of the military commandant towards the embankments in question.ffr-lj No. 89 op 1909.

As you are aware, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople has been requested to urge the Turkish authorities, at a suitable moment, to settle this matter by arbitration. It is therefore of great importance that he should have early and accurate information as to any developments that may occur. 3. It would seem best for Sheikh Mubarak’s interests that he should give us his complete confidence in the matter. Unless he does so, it is extremely difficult tor us to act effectively for him. Perhaps you will be able to persuade him to see the matter in this light. No. 90, dated Koweit, the 20th February 1909. From— Major S. G. Knox, I. A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 hav f ^ hon ! ol L r acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 430, dated nth February 1909, requesting that I will ascertain how Sheikh Mubarak was enabled to rebuild his embankment at Fao and (2) inform you whether his dispute with the Turks can now be considered settled or merely in abeyance. / 2 ' u a c?: gr , a E h J ? f y0 , ur ! etter would appear to me to suggest that I should approach Sheikh Mubarak himself on this matter and encourage him to give us his full confidence. Sheikh Mubarak is, at the present up river and tnereaooears to me to be no immediate prospect of h.s return, and the mevitable delav in referring the matter to him induces me to request, with a 1 deference, a re-consideration of this suggestion. If the present setilement is fair and above- board there is not the slightest doubt that the matter will come to light either from the Sheikh himself or from other sources, notably Basrah information. „ jf on chg 0 ther hand, as is far more probable, the present settlement has been°effected by bribery, any questions put to Sheikh Mubarak will merely arouse his suspicions and, if he should exactly realise the situation, he would regard with some measure of contempt, my indiscretion in asking inconvenient Questions and would certainly not tell me the truth. That Sheikh Mubarak will give me or anyone else, his complete confidence in this or any other matter, 1 am not sanguine enough to expect. He finds it extremely convenient to use his presumed influence with the British authorities to gain his private ends and does so with considerable adroitness if we may judge from the Political Agent, Bahrein’s letter No. 88, dated 30th January 1909 on the question of Koweit pearl merchants’ claims against Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, Chief of Katar. 4. With regard to the second question as to whether his dispute with the Turks can now be considered as settled or is merely in abeyance, I fear that it is necessary to consider it merely in abeyance. _ What is certain is that Sheikh Mubarak does not now wish to re-open the question for the present at any rate, and would probably regret the appointment of a Commission. The only action that would appear at all advisable would be perhaps a visit, unofficial, by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, if he approves, and the visit could be arranged without alarming 7 'urkish suspicion, so that the fact of the sudd having been actually re-constructed might rest on more substantial evidence than Sheikh Munarak’s statement and corroborative rumours from Fao. No doubt, Sheikh Mubarak would be delighted to arrange for the visit in his steam launch, which is now up river. I have the honour to submit this suggestion for your consideration. f) No. 100-T., dated Bushire, the 9th March 1909. From —Major P. Z. Cox.

I have the honour to refer to your reply No. 90, dated 20th February to Captain Trevor’s letter, Residency No. 430, of nth idem, in connection with the Fao embankment question. 2. 1 do not find myself quite sharing the apprehensions expressed in’para- graph 3 of your letter. Sheikh Mubarak specifically requested us to assist his interests by endea vouring to have a commission (to be attended by a British Officer) appointed for the investigation and equitable settlement of the embankment question. 1 see no sufficient reason why we should hesitate to remind him of that fact in a friendly way and add that he will no doubt realise the importance of keeping us accurately posted in regard to any developments that may be taking place, in order that His Majesty’s Ambassador may be informed, and thus enabled to shape his representations accordingly. I feel sure that Sheikh Mubarak has sufficient common sense to appreciate that aspect of the question. In any case, we are entitled to presume that he has, without indiscretion. But I opine that, if adroitly approached, he will readily respond, and I request you, if one has not already occurred, to take an early opportunity of mentioning the matter. If you need any opening, it might well be a message from me, sent on return to headquarters, on learning with pleasure that the bund had somehow or other been re-constructed without objection from the local authorities at Fao.3 K «ils!ip&gt; HlBBi Flijjjj K2x; u Biiiie safe vjislf. ,ui» it No&lt; 143, dated the 15th March 1909.

[March 8.] WITH reference to my despatch No. 138 of the 28th ultimo, in which’ I urged the desirability of not at present raising the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s claim to property near Pao and to my telegram of the same date, I have the honour to transmit herewith the best account of tlie interpellation in the Chamber on the subject of the Bagdad Bailway Convention which appeared in the local press. While the Convention was severely criticized by several Deputies, who treated the subject in detail, the Minister of Public W orks, who is now acting as Minister for Boreign Affairs, defended it on general lines, and though his explanations do not seem very convincing, they were accepted as sufficient by a majority of the House. Among the five points raised in Ismail Hakki Bey’s interpellation is that of Koweit as a possible terminus for the railway. In bis reply the Minister merely stated that the question of the terminus bad not yet been settled, and that it must depend on further local investigations and considerations of commercial expediency. But in ! the ensuing discussion the interpellator stated that Lord Curzon had rendered the status of Koweit a somewhat anomalous one, having perhaps exceeded the wishes of bis Government in the matter, but that it was to be hoped that the friendship of England would not suffer such a state of affairs to continue. The Ottoman Govern ment was at the same time an Islamic Government, and England would never sacrifice immense interests for the sake of a little corner like Koweit. By this the speaker | alluded presumably to the possibility of the spread of disaffection among the Moslems in India, owing to British encroachments on the dominions of the Caliph, but he went on to smooth any susceptibility that might be affected by such a reference by the declaration that the presence of Bifaat Pasha at the Ministry of Eoreign Affairs on his arrival from England would be a proof of the friendly spirit entertained among Ottomans for England. To the question as to why the route followed the Konia plain instead of the Angora-Osesarea line, in which decision foreign intervention was suspected, the Minister replied that it was solely on economic grounds that the northern route was abandoned. As regards the alleged existence of an Agreement with Russia, reserving all Railway Concessions within a certain zone in Northern Anatolia to Russian enterprise, the Minister declined to make a definite statement, but said that understandings come to with the Russian Government previous to the introduction of Constitutional Government in both countries could easily be recast in view of the very friendly relations which now existed between Turkey and Russia. The interpellator laid stress on the political importance of the ownership of shares, as evinced by the negotiations for tiie participation of English and French capital on equal terms with Germany, negotiations which broke down through the Anglo-French entente after the South African War. Ismail Hakki Bey criticized the terms of the Convention in detail, pointing out that while the general rate of kilometric guarantees should be from 8,000 fr. to 9,000 fr., the Ottoman Government gave 15,000 fr., thus assuring a 4 per cent, interest on the capital. But it was not the Company which found that capital, it was again the State which had to borrow it and become the debtor instead of the Company. The Convention really included seven or eight different Concessions, with all its different privileges for exploiting mines, quarries, &amp;c. As it was impossible to cancel the Concession, and to buy it in would be more burdensome than its execution, the speaker said it only remained either to stop the work or modify the Convention. Another Deputy, after inveighing against the ruinous methods of the old Palace camarilla generally and deploring the rejection of various previous offers to build the line without a kilometric guarantee, showed that while the cost of constructing similar railways in India was only about 130,000 fr. per kilom., the Bagdad Railway cost 269,000 fr. He then alluded to the financial situation of Turkey, and said the anly hope of meeting the deficit of the Budget lay in raising the customs duties to Section 3. [8919J No. 1. (No. 156.) Sir, Sir G.

I made friendly represent ations to the Vali and the Commandant of Basra at the time, at the request of the Resident at Bushire. The Turks however objected to the work on the land near the fort on military grounds and the Kilid Bahr was despatched to Fao in 1907 to destroy the embankment, which had been raised by the Sheikh near the fort. The embankment was according^ destroyed as directed. The matter subsequently formed the subject of Sir E.

A latrine should be provided for these rooms. (3) 3rd class passengers. Huts should be built to accommodate the average number of third class passengers arriving in Koweit by the steamer which is always in quarantine. On this basis huts would probably have to be built for about 30 3rd class passengers. Arrangements for expansion during epidemics would be necessary in addition.

No. 664 , dated Koweit, the 11th December 1907 (Confidential). From—M ^joe S. G. Knox, T.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., I.A., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. J J Consul- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No 2556 dated 3rd of December 1907, on the subject of quarantine. ' ’ 2 . I would submit, at the outset, that I am perhaps travelling out of mv province in making the suggestion below which would cover to a large extent the whole question of quarantine for vessels arriving at the various Persian Gulf ports from Indian ports, but it has occurred to me that some suchsuo-^es tion, if found feasible, would render the local problem at Koweit far simpler and it might perhaps also be found a serviceable plan at other ports. ^ ’ 3. Our main difficulty here, from the quarantine point of view, is the horde of Arab boatmen, passengers and their friends who try to board the steamer the minute she arrives in port. It is almost impossible, with the local authorities averse to strong measures, if not actually hostile to quarantine to control this unruly crowd. u ’ 4. A minor difficulty, hut still one that I do not see the possibility of any locally enlisted staff dealing with successfully, is the disembarkation of passen gers in one lot. ^ 5. My most important suggestion is that there should be a permanent quarantine staff of six Indian policemen under a havildar and under the orders of the ship surgeon, employed with each vessel. The question of the pay of these men and of the allowances to be paid to the ship’s surgeon for this extrawork is completely beyond my ken and I therefore need offer no excuse for not discussing it. Their duties would be to see that no one holds any communica tion with the ship on any pretext whatever or leaves it before the local doctor boards the vessel. Quarantine would thus be imposed as far as the vessel is concerned with complete indifference to the wishes of Sheikhs or local author ities of any kind. Nobody can offer any reasonable objection to our doing what we like with our own ship whatever may happen on shore. 6 . The local doctor should then command the situation. He could first order up the boom destined to convey the passengers to quarantine which he could have distinguished by a large yellow flag, he would probably go in it himself to the steamer. He would refuse to allow any cargo-boats or other to come alongside the steamer until his tale of passengers with their baggage was safely embarked under his own charge. This list of passengers and the passen gers would be found ready prepared for him, on arrival, by the ship’s quaran tine staff. 7. He would thus be in a position to enforce quarantine on his own account on the passengers, provided he was given a general permission by the Sheikh or other local authority to enforce quarantine, more especially if the cost of a boom and the pay of boatmen in regular employ were sanctioned by Government. This however and the general question of arrangements on shore will be discussed in a separate letter. 8 . He would still further command the situation by directing the ship’s surgeon and the quarantine staff of the steamer to admit no one at any time on board the steamer, unless armed with a conspicuous ticket of some^ kind to he delivered up on boarding the steamer or with a regular passenger’s ticket from the local agent of the Company, proving that the hearer was a genuine passenger. This latter suggestion will probably commend itself to the steamers’ agents generally. 9. There would thus be no necessity for any local quarantine staff to board the steamer except our own medical officers. The local arrangements here are to a large extent free from foreign criticism and if this proposal was put in force, no foreign passenger wmuld be able to say whether quarantine was enforced locally or not, hut he would he bound to certify that, as far as the steamers were concerned, all reasonable precautions had been taken. 10 . I fully realise that these proposals would not cover the case of steamers other than the British India steamers, hut that phase of the problem has not, so far, presented itself in Koweit at all and local sailing craft must come under the head of local arrangements on shore which I relegate to my letter promised in paragraph 7 above. No. 667 , dated Koweit, the 16 th December 1907 (Confidential). From— -Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., I.A., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In my letter No. 664, dated 11th December 1907, I had the honour to lay before you certain suggestions for enforcing quarantine by measures taken on board the steamers which would considerably simplify the local problem at Koweit. I will now endeavour to deal with the supplementary precautions to he tak en on shore. 2. Now that the Sheikh has consented in general terms to the imposition of quarantine on mail steamers visiting this port, it would not be difficult, I think, if sufficient inducements were offered to him and the expense of the scheme is not considered prohibitive, to set forth a regular scheme which would result in a very complete enforcement of quarantine regulations. 3. It would first of all be necessary to lease the island of Shweikh, an ideal quarantine station, and to buy out the ’Awazim fishermen who have fishing rights on the island. The last portion of the expense would be, I venture to hope, a comparatively trifling one. Rupees 200 per month would he an outside estimate. The acquisition of the i-land would, perhaps, raise less alarm among foreign powers, if acquired on these grounds, and as we may look forward to the cessation of plague some time or other, the island would be useful for other5 [Confidential.] f t, d No. 1802, dated Bushire, tlie 7th (received 15th) June 1908.

In his letter No. 664 of nth December, Major Knox proposed an arrangement under which the vessels of the British India Steam Navicmtion Company would carry on board a guard furnished at the expense of the Govern ment of India, by which means quarantine could be enforced as far as these vessels were concerned, with indifference to the wishes and attitude of the Sheikh In a letter dated 13th December received at the same time the Political Agent dealt with the precautions which might be arranged on shore, and in this con nection recommended the leasing of the Island of Shwaikh from the Sheikh conditionally on his agreeing to be guided by our advice in the application of quarantine measures. rr , , firS n t °J t i he i se j P r opo sa, s. as an arrangement in force for Koweit only and for the British India Steam Navigation Company’s mail steamers only, did not appear to the Residency Surgeon or myself as a satisfactory one, and our Deparrmem 111 ^ 1 * ^ ^ ^ letter N °‘ 779 ’ dated 8th Marc Mo the Foreign 3- I now request perusal of the two further reports quoted in the margin KO *Do! ett * r No.' Ig*JUd April' 1 fr ° m Ma i° r r Knox.

It remains to consider what action can best be taken to bring the Sheikh M W ^ ° f , m -' nd m . regard t0 his quarantine arrangements. Major Knox suggests a formal intimation to him in the terms suggested in paragraph 5 of his letter No. 197, but I am a little inclined to think that Jo make an intimation to him forthwith in that sense might confirm him in his Lfalre d e f ^ &amp; deadl ° ck - ^t any rate as the matter has already been in abeyance for some time owing to my absence on tour I think that n°. harm will be done, pending consideration of the situation ’by Government if the letter of which I enclose a copy is addressed by me to Sheikh Mubarak, and am therefore taking that course.

I am writing to you now especially regarding the question of quarantine at Koweit. Recent reports show that even the simple measures hitherto imposed with your concurrence to safeguard your port are now discontinued by your orders, and that your subjects hold communication with the ships just as they please. I think perhaps you have not fully understood the position as regards this matter of quarantine. It is not to gratify their own pleasure that my Government have appointed a doctor at Koweit and placed him at your service for quarantine work. Their ob ject in sending him is .to assist you, firstly, to keep your port clear of infection and also in order not to give the nations grounds for saying that while all necessary measures are taken at Maskat, Bahrein, Bushire and Mohammerah to prevent the entry of infection only Koweit remains without any proper system and that thereby danger results to Mesopotamia and to Europe. Your wise rule has so promoted the prosperity and advance of Koweit in other ways that you would assuredly be making a great mistake to be backward in this matter which is of the utmost importance not only to yourself but also to your neighbours and especially now that ocean-going steamers visit your port it is not possible, if you wish them to continue doing so that you can dis pense with all preventive measures against the entry of disease. I beg you to take the whole matter again into consideration and to re-insti tute adequate measures in communication with the Political Agent, so that I can inform Government and they will be freed from anxiety. Otherwise they will feel that the trouble and expense which they incur in order to help you in this matter is thrown away and that in spite of it the health of your port and of steamers visiting it is a matter of indifference to you and a source of complaint to others. Believe me it is altogether against your best interests that such an idea should endure, and I look forward to receiving an early assurance from you in reply to this letter that you will re-institute precautionary measures both against ships in harbour and passengers ashore. This is what had to be explained. May you be preserved and salams. From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit. To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of correspondence ending with my letter No. 1541 dated the 3rd April 1908, I have the honour to inform you that, on the 14th April, the Assistant Surgeon came to me and informed me .that, on his usual visit to the Sheikh to take instructions as to quarantine^ measures, the Sheikh had informed him that, in consequence of the complaints of his subjects, he had decided not to detain passengers in quarantine. The Assistant Surgeon asked me for instructions. 2. I informed the Assistant Surgeon that, if matters had been correctly represented, nothing remained except to report the matter to higher authority, but, as I had already previously arranged for an interview that same afternoon, I would raise the question and inform him what was eventually decided upon. 3. I visited the Sheikh at 11 o’clock, Arabic time, and he then told me that, inconsequence of the complaints of his subjects and the healthy state of the ship and the six days’ passage from Bombay he had decided not to detain passengers apparently healthy. 1 then said that 1 presumed that he did not No. 1S2, dated the 15th April 1908.wish the Assistant Surgeon to visit the steamer. The Sheikh renlipH tW ™ co„., a ,y he attached considerable importance to the medfcal Tnspectl* of ^ passengers and that his servant would also see to the disembarkation of passen gers and that any found sick by the Assistant Surgeon would be detained until the Assistant Surgeon pronounced that they could be released without danger. to me' J h tbP“r St ' 0n °! ^ fabS fr0m J the t0wn boardin g the steamer did not occur the time, and I contented myself with saying to the Sheikh that I had the p e S d clv m t at T Slderable t , l ngth the ar g«for the enforcement ol mvself H iJ tl0 u l9 ° 3 and that 1 Would not trouble him by repeating myself. He knew the dangers perfectly.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. . , 1 have tbe honour to forward, herewith, the report of the Assistant Snr™ with reference to h.s quarantine duties on board S S. “ Kola ” when sh^ cflled at this port last Thursday. en sne ca “ ec i 2. I myself went to the steamer and am in a position to support the Assist ant Surgeon s statement of the difficulties he met with in attempting to enforce even the ™ lld a nd modified system of quarantine imposed by Sheikh Mubarak No Kowe.t official took the smallest interest in the proceedings. Boats of all kmds were alongside the steamer belore the doctor’s boat or the Sheikh’s customs boat reached and the steamer was freely boarded by all and sundry .'dueling, to my amazement, the nakhoda of my own jolly boat. This offeX was promptly and speedily dealt with, and I think that it is extremely unlikely that any of my people will offend again. y unlll{el y 3 - When 1 tried to get hold of the Sheikh’s servant who was supnosed tn Surgeon ' ,he AssistaM s '^°' w°s ed i o 4- , 1 ^ enture t0 thin k that it now becomes a matter for serious consider ation whether our medical officer should be permitted any longer to panic inate in tins farce which is only calculated to bring him into contempt and is utter v futile, both from a medical and political point of view. y 5. I would, therefore, recommend that I should be instnweH • r !he Sheikh that it seems perfectly clear that he has no serious i iient onToT' force quaranline, that we decline to allow our officials to be exposed a“™ lonjei4 to ridicule, and that the Government of India cannot permit Koweit to defy the world in general ; that it will shortly formulate proposals for a proper system of quarantine to be managed by its own officers and that, in the meanwhile, fast mails will no longer call at Koweit. 6. The Political Agent’s own mail bag with his household and British subjects’ letters could be sent to Fao and inward letters received from there and it would be as well, if I received instructions to delay the issue of all other Koweit letters until the arrival of the following slow mail. 7. It is with extreme reluctance and regret that I formulate these proposals, for I have tried without intermission to induce Koweit, both its Sheikh and people, to adopt the only reasonable attitude in this matter and enforce, of them selves, a system of quarantine, guided by proper medical advice. Some pro gress is made and then we find matters worse than before. 8. Since the above paragraphs were drafted, Sheikh Mubarak has returned from Failiya and in accordance with custom I went on the 2 and instant and paid the usual visit of welcome on his return. The talk drifted on to quarantine matters, and I pointed out to the Sheikh how his orders were being disobeyed. The Sheikh, with a frankness to which, from him, I am little accustomed, said that his orders would not be disobeyed, but pointed out that while we were constantly pressing our own demands upon him, we allowed his interests in Fao to be completely neglected. 9. No clearer intimation could possibly be given that he was deliberately thwarting our plans to compel us to fall in with his views regarding his Fao properties. He said that he held a paper from us to say that they were also under our protection, but I have no definite knowledge of the paper to which he alludes. 10. The Sheikh appears to wish for the appointment of a commission headed by His Excellency the Wali on which Basrah landowners should be strongly represented (he specially mentions the Nakib of Basrah) and he also desires the attendance of a representative on the part of the British Government. He says that he objects to the deputation of underlings whose one object is to fill their own purses. There is, I think, no doubt that such a commission, if the Turkish authorities would consent to it, would do a great deal towards bringing these obscure squabbles into the light of day and would form a valuable precedent for the future. n. This intention of the Sheikh to thwart our plans and interests in Koweit until we show more activity in Fao was expressed with the utmost good nature, but there is no doubt that it is seriously meant and indications of his putting his intention into execution are not wanting. Quarantine is only one of the ways in ’which he seeks to express his dissatisfaction. The lease of the Agency premises and the additional plot, property of the late Mubarak bin Zaid, are hanging fire and the results of some rather acrimonious discussions are not yet ripe for report Copy of Quarantine report, dated the 16 th April igo 8 , S.S. “ Kola” arrived here to-day at about 6 p.M. She had 41 passengers on board for Koweit, 26 from Bombay, and the rest from other Gulf ports. One was a second class passenger of the name of Mr. Hormuzion, and the rest were deck passengers. The yellow quarantine flag was seen flying all the time on the steamship. Sheikh Mubarak was seen as usual regarding arrangements to be made for the observation of quarantine. This time he gave me verbal instructions to examine all passengers on board the steamship, and to let go those who were found healthy, and to detain in quarantine such as were found to be sick. People from the shore, who boarded the ship, were to be detained in quarantine up to the proper time, according to instructions.The difficulty of getting the passengers together on board the ship for examination, was previously pointed out by me. I went on board the ship as usual, and requested the authorities of the ship to get all the passengers together for examination, but they failed to do so, in spite of their best efforts. The guard at used to accompany me since the last two months was absent this time Under the circumstances, therefore, I examined as many passengers as were p esented to me for examination by the authorities of the ship. In all 26 W6re examined h y me in this wa y. and the rest went away without examination. J at t the P r .°P er t™ 6 t. 0 exam: ne such persons from the shore, as had boarded the steamship.

Political Agent recommends that I should still adhere to the original proposal that fast mail steamer service be suspended pending settlement of the question of quarantine. In the latter connection First Assistant Buggests, and I concur, that, if as is expected, Political Agent gets his steam launch in autumn he could send to Fao for his mails when it is necessary, and fast service to Koweit could be suspended altogether and the question of quarantine would be then Ordinarily unimportant. B. I. Company would probably welcome this. fay Il 2 Translation of letter dated. 14th Jamadi-al-Awwal 1326 H.-14th June igs8 t from Sheikh Mubarak us Subah, ruler of Kowett, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in the Persian Gulf. A reply to Residency letter No. 149, dated the 7th June 1908. n After Compliments. It is with the hand of friendship I have received your letter dated the 7th Jamadi-al-Awwal, 1326 H., and what you ordered was made known—the expres sion of your sorrow at your not being able to be present at the assembly of the marriage night of our son Hamad because of your absence in the month of May, and we were still more sorry at wanting your presence, which would have been a reason for increase in our rejoicings and perfecting our joy, and we were proud and honoured in the presence of His Excellency the Naval_ Commander-in- Chief, and we obtained perfect joy from his visit to our town, which is to be con sidered the town of Government, and from the friendship of Major Knox, etc., etc., and likewise his friendship with my brother Mo’iz-as-SuItana, Sardar Arfa’.the Sheikh Khazal Khan when he honoured our town, and altogether we were grate ful to the presence of Major Knox, etc., for his friendship and his reckoning our house to be the house of the Government, and I am proud in this reckoning, and certainly Your Honour believes in my friendship and love towards the precious Imperial English Government and obedience to its lofty commands and the facilities which I procure for the Consul who is with us in everything that he demands from me according to the order of Government in his journeys in the Arabian peninsula, whether it may be to Anta’a which is near A 1 Ahsa and the place of settling of the tribes of A 1 Ahsa, and I cause to go with him the chiefs of the tribes aforesaid in his service, or it may be to A 1 Hafar, which is the boundary between us and Nejd, and I cause to go with the Consul the Amirs of the Arabs in his service and it may be to Basra on the desert road my servants are in his service, and from these facilities which I grant, I have seen opposition from the Turks and universal injury to my property in Fao which is the livelihood of the family of Subah, all of them. The Turks have destroyed it. And if mat ters remain in this opposition, we shall abandon it (viz., the land) and also be fore this, two years ago, my clerks were driven out from my house, and my pro perty at Fao and 6,000 maunds of my dates were destroyed, and worse than the destruction was the driving out of my clerks before all people and the injury to my honour and all that which happened to my property before I have placed it, and what has happened now, 1 have also placed it before your exalted Honour and before the Consul who is with us. And besides what they are doing to my property of injury, they have also stirred up the most corrupt of mankind, who is estimated by yourself and others than yourself as a noted pirate, Nagaimish, upon the boundaries between Fao and Ma’aamir, and they send their servants, the regimental officer and the regi mental clerk and the accountant of A 1 Ahsa and the Kaim Mokam, and they are present at the boundaries, and they demand three men from Fao and three men from Ma’aamir and three men from Fao come present, three good old men, born in Fao, and they ask them to swear about the Fao boundaries. And they stood on the creek and swore honestly that this is the boundary of Fao and Ma’aamir and those whom Nagaimish presented by force wTen they ask them for their oath, they hesitate, because they are liars and not from the people of Ma’aamir, and they see the appearance of opposition of those who come from Ma’aamir and they know that the truth is with the persons who come from the people of Fao. Then when they come back to Basra and their friends ask them “ what do you write?”. They answer : “ The right is with Mubarak, but we see the intention of the Wali and we write.” And, apart from that, when my servants are present, my agents in Fao, only two men and their rosaries in their hands, and when Nagaimish is present he brings with him 200 men, armed with firearms. Now that is the limit of his power, but 1 have thousands and am submissive and try conciliatory proceedings, but those who are determined to do me injury—and the causes are evident—from the direction of the north are exciting Nagaimish, and from the south their soldiers and officials and the Wali writes to the KaimMokam who is honoured among them and under their influence and threatens him with responsibility, and he writes to them the actual state of affairs and mentions to them ' Mubarak has not embanked in my days, and he has no unreclaimed lands to embank. This is in my days, and the questioning is from the people who have information that these embankments are of old time and they are always repairing from it.” And the Wali is bent on an injury and does not accept the report of the Kaim Mokam and has destroyed my property, and I ask for pity from your high position that they should treat me with justice, and that they should send from the people of Basra persons who are under their influence like the Nakib of the Sharifs of Basra and Mahmud Pasha, the Wakil i- Sannia, and people like them that they may see and I will accept. And I, my first treaty with the Government, my first conditions were the preservation of my property, and they gave me an order for that from your predecessor present with me and its copy with you. That is not for the protection of Koweit. The matter of Koweit is to me a small affair. Its people will defend it some how or another. My only object is the protection of my property and my honour. It is not a question of covetousness. I have plenty of wealth and sitting down J see neglect on your part. And I and niy property and my good name and my honour are entering ■into the protection of the precious Imperial English Government, and in spite of all these troubles which I see from the Turks, I am still patient and following your orders, which I shall perform whether in quarantine or other ways. And your lofty Presence ordered that the quarantine has been arran£ed in Maskat and Bahrein. I would present to your Highness, although that is an .evident matter, which you know, but for the manifestation of the position 1 do not resemble my brothers, the Amir of Maskat and the Amir of Bahrein. For the aforesaid, passengers do not go to them in the mails except by chance from among the people of their towns. I am the ruler of Koweit and the whole of the Arabian peninsula, and in it many great princes under my orders and entrusting their heads to me and those who come from India and other places are not the people of Koweit but of all the tribes and of all the people of Nejd and, as soon as there was the name of the quarantine, I began to content them’ and the princes addressed me about their families and their dependants and followers who come in the mail steamers why I was stopping them in the harbour when they were coming from a long journey and those awaiting from a distant road and stopping them that they should not see them nor greet them. Then I content them and answer them that this is the order of the Government. They answer, “No matter! that is, let the order of the Government proceed for separating us and we are Islam. We say what God wills, will be and what he does not wish, will not be. And we were vexed by the quarantine, and it does not repel. God is the repeller. And we see your servants who are in your possessions at Fao flying away from Turkish oppression, and they in your assembly inform us of all that is going on against (your) property.” “ Also, in our places, reaches us news of all that goeson against you from the injuries inflicted by the Turks, especially against your Tao property. Now we will not consent to these troubles which are against Shara’, and we will not agree about you that you should be patient under these troubles which are happening against your property. Then if this Government whom you and we are following—at your desire expressed to us—will repel from your property then it is due from you that you conciliate them in such a way as may not injure. ’Then if we see that, then we shall know that your opinion has hit the mark. But if the Turks go on in this way in the injury of your property without right and there is no stopping of that, enough, we have not seen a place for protection We do not warn protection,” ■ N ? W „ th v . e 11 } tentl0n | s that I should make plain the circumstances and in spite of all this, I am under your orders And the passengers who come in the mail boats, there will be from the people of Koweit one in ten and nine from the families of the tribes and people of Nejd and the Princes whoge followers will come in the mail steamers in their address to me they have the right on their side against me because I also have seen your carelessness aboqt the protection of my property for the repelling from it in the path of right and the present customsin Basra (apparently Turkish vexations and misrule). And in spite of all this I am at your orders, if you order me to be patient under the injury to my property and the objections urged by the Arab princes against me, then 1 , according to my custom, will rest patient under orders, but 1 say—“ This is against your welf known and proved pity and your protection to every one who flees for shelter to your shadow. Now I arid my name and my property are under your protection and under your orders.^ Then it was incumbent on me to present the circumstances Your Consul who is in Basra heard from the Wali that this land which Mubarak has enclosed came out of the river. Then what comes out of the river there is in it to the Government a right. Now their fort has been built 22 years from its com mencement, and the mud which they have used to embank is from this place and also this embankment which I enclosed for the protection of my property is fourteen years old, and yearly I repair it and others not less than three or four times. And their officials were looking on at it and did not molest me. Then if it is a fact that there is in my possession land coming out from the river it is necessary that they should deal with me according to the rules and precedents as they do with others, according to the agreements of the assembly of the Idara who will make me owner of the land in the change of records. The ownership in the change of records is to the owner of the lands whether myself or another. Then I demand right like all the Basra proprietors, that they should deal with me, by sending persons of Basra, as I have mentioned in my petition above who know about properties and their present day rules, and that they should see this land which they are quarrelling with me about, and I will abide by whatever these people may say, after they see it. And I also will make present with them whomsoever you may appoint, the Consul at Basra or another that he may be present. 1 hen that is what is incumbent upon you that you should watch over my rights. Otherwise, if I have no right, at that time, 1 will be content. Also the princes who are now objecting against me, when they have seen assistance from you, in the protection of my rights they also will be content and will not object against me. And this contradiction is only from the Wali of Basra, and yourGov- ( r iment has ordered that they sent the doctor especially on account of quarantine, and what we know is that the doctor was sent by the Government out of pity for askedTnr 0 ^ 0 ^^ s,ck ° f the Pf&gt;ple. _ This is according to our request when we asked for the doctor.

Usual ending. Dated 21 st April iSgg, ! True translation, S. G. KNOX, Major, Political Agent, Koweit. No. 348, dated Koweit, the 28th June 1908 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour, in continuation of my letter No. 335, dated 23rd June 1908, to report the subsequent history of the visit of the S. S. “ Kasara ” to this port on Thursday morning last. 2. Shortly after the Agent of Messrs. Gray Paul and Co. had received intimation, sent by me, of the latest orders of the Sheikh on the quarantine question, he came to me and asked for permission to try and persuade the Sheikh to alter his decision with reference to this fast mail and the next. I was unable to approve this course, as the Sheikh knew perfectly well what he was doing and that he is deliberately thwarting us in our proposals to establish quarantine and trying to convince us that Koweit can do perfectly well without the steamship companies. Anything, therefore, that would persuade him that we were inconvenienced by his action would, I judged, only strengthen his determin ation. I saw no objection, however, to his asking the Sheikh to provide the usual boats for conveyance of the passengers, as though the Agent had no infor mation of the Sheikh’s most recent orders, and accepting the Sheikh’s decision on the point whatever it might be. 3. The Agent returned to me on Wednesday afternoon with the news that the Sheikh had, in his presence, ordered four passenger boats to proceed to the mail steamer. In the circumstances, f saw no reason whatever to interfere or remonstrate and indeed, my first notion was that the Assistant Surgeon had, in some way or other, managed to misunderstand the Sheikh’s orders.4. I made arrangements to proceed myself to the steamer to watch events, and, in view of the conflicting reports that I had received as regards the impost tiou of quarantine, 1 saw no necessity to place myself under any restrictions in that respect. My boat was the first to arrive, and I remained on the steamer for some considerable time, watched the Sheikh’s customs-officer and in fact, any body who pleased, board the steamer and the passengers with their luggage being disembarked. The steamer arrived about 20 minutes after midnight and left at 3 A. M. and was on the move, before 1 reached the shore. 5. In the afternoon on Friday. I visited the Sheikh; I quite expected, as I have said above that 1 should find that the Sheikh’s instructions to the Assistant Surgeon had been misunderstood I opened the conversation by remarking that I should be glad if the Sheikh would be so good as to tell me the tenour of his instructions to the Assistant Surgeon which had astonished me considerably. The Sheikh asked me what the Assistant Surgeon had reported, and I told hint the substance of the report that I had the honour to submit to you with my letter quoted above. The Sheikh replisd that the Assistant Surgeon’s report was correct in every particular, and added that he had written to the steamer authorities in Bombay to say that quarantine was imposed on all fast mail steamers, and that therefore they should no longer book passengers to Koweit by those steamers. 6. I remarked that the passengers from this fast mail had been landed and had not gone to Basra. The Sheikh began to tell me that they had not been landed , when I cut him short by remarking that 1 was on the steamer and saw them being disembarked. He then said that it was not in his boats, and I did not think it worth while to point out that there were only three boats alongside the steamer, while I was there; that one of these was my own which naturally carried no passengers, and that the first boat after mine into which I saw a number of Indian passengers being disembarked had carried one of his principal customs officers to the steamer. The Sheikh then added that he detained all the pas sengers until noon on Thursday in the boat harbour. As the passengers for the most part belonged to a gang of Indian boatmen who have come to look after a wrecked dinghy, subsequent enquiries have served to confirm my first impres sion that this statement was utterly false. The passengers were seen by two natives of India in a coffee-shop in the bazar early on Thursday. 7. The Sheikh then began to lay doum his view's about quarantine generally and brought out the fatalistic saying that he had already quoted in his letter te your address, forwarded with my No. 334, dated 24th June 1908, “ Mash’Allah yakun wa ma lam usha lam yakun.” I countered with the equally well known Muhammadan tradition which I described as the father of all quarantine theories “ To the place in which there is sickness, go not; and, if sickness comes upon you, flee not. “ I showed the Sheikh that, in strict obedience to pure Muham madan tradition, no sound Muhammadan should visit either Bombay or Karachi and that our quarantine was merely an endeavour to cany out the spirit of that tradition, while not observing, in all its destructive strictness, the letter. 8. The Sheikh replied, admitting the tradition, that, on the w'hole, he preferred the letter and that he and his people would be inclined to do without Bombay and Karachi altogether, if going to those places meant rules and regulations. They were all for freedom, a truly audacious statement from such a despot. He then asked about the slow mails, and I said that it seemed, so far as I had seen, unnecessarv to place any restrictions on them, as it was barely possible for passengers to land before noon on Thursdays, by which time they would have completed the five days’ passage from the last infected port, but, that, if the Sheikh wished, they should, in the strict interpretation of the Paris Convention, be detained until noon and examined by a competent medical officer; that, in the event of sickness at Bahrein or Bushire, a longer detention would be necessary. The Sheikh then said that, if quarantine was essential, they would do without the slow steamers also. 9. I also asked what would be done to prevent people from the shore land ing on ships under quarantine, and the Sheikh said that he would not send boats and that we could arrange to get our post and transact our business, and that8 2. I shall be obliged if you will kindly render any assistance possible to the Sheikh’s men in enforcing the Sheikh’s orders and also inform the Quarantine Medical Officer whether, to the best of your knowledge and belief, any passengers have managed to disembark at Koweit. 3. The Sheikh further desires that no persons except intending passengers be allowed to board the steamer, the Quarantine Officer of course being an ex ception as usual. Copy of a letter, dated the 8th July igo8,from the Commander S. S. “ Dumra' to the Political Agent, Kaweit. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 376 of 1908. Three passengers were booked for Koweit and disembarked before the arrival of the Quarantine Officer and the Sheikh’s man. I requested the Sheikh’s man to have the passengers sent on board again, but he said he could not do so. Quarantine Report. Koweit, gth July igo8. S. S. “ Dumra ” arrived here yesterday evening at about 8 P.M. — ' I saw Sheikh Mubarak on Tuesday the 7th instant to receive instructions from him regarding quarantine. He said that as there was to be quarantine in Koweit, the passengers for Koweit would not be allowed to land in Koweit, but would be taken to Basra or Mohammerah. He also said that there was no necessity for me to go on board the ship, and that intimation had been already sent to Bombay about two weeks ago that passengers coming by the fast mail would not be allowed to land in Koweit, but would be taken to Moham- meran or Basra instead. fvaracni was declared to be an unclean port. Under instructions from the Political Agent, I went on board the ship, and found that the passengers for Koweit were taken in the Sheikh’s boat to be landed on shore. 1 informed Captain Cole, the Commander of the vessel that recent instructions from the Sheikh were to the effect that passengers for Koweit should not be allowed to land in Koweit, but should be taken to Mohammerah or Basra instead. The Commander of the vessel told me that he could not help it, as the Sheikh’s men trf 11 a Tu em m t ^ leir . He said that if it was the Sheikh’s order not a low the passengers to land in Koweit, his own men ought not to have taken the passengers in their boat to land them on shore. Some people from the shore were seen to have hoarded the steamer, and aid not observe quarantine restrictions. (Signed) Rustomji Ardeshir, Quarantine Medical Officer, Koweit. C. C. B.

'a vflfAjZNo. 9, dated Shiraz, the loth (received 24th) August 1908. From —Major P.Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, I have the honour to lay before Government the report called for in Foreign Department telegram No. S.-377, dated 16th June 1908. A good deal of correspondence has since passed on the subject with the Political Agent, Koweit, the progress of which has caused some unavoidable delay in the submission of my reply. 2. In order the better to explain the present position I venture to retrace a few steps on the record. His Majesty’s Secretary of State in his telegram of June 12th enquired how the settlement reported in my telegram of March 10th had been upset. My telegraphic report of that date was based on Major Knox’s letter No. 95, •Forwarded with Residency letter No. 86:, received on 9th March * informing me dated ,5th March ,908. that Sheikh Mubarak had spontaneously intimated that the trouble appeared to be over for the time, as he had explained the circumstances to the Wall and a Turxish Commission had investigated the question and decided that the embankments need not be interfered with. The Wali nevertheless was said to have expressed the view that they appeared to obstruct the outlook from the Fort and that the repair of them had better not be continued. 3 o-, 0n 3 r d March Major Knox wrote that Sheikh Mubarak was very full of his troubles at Fao and asked that he or I or Consul Crow should visit the spot and thresh out the whole matter and if possible have a proper sketch made of the property. Further Mr, Lyle the British India Steam Navigation Company’s Agent at Basrah, and an old friend of Sheikh Mubarak, who visited Koweit about then, informed the Political Agent that it was evident from the Sheikh’s confidences to him, that he was very much exercised in regard to this question and did not think that he was receiving from us the measure of assistance to which he felt himself entitled. . I visited Koweit a few days later and Sheikh Mubarak at my interviews with him repeated his grievances with insistence. I therefore despatched to Government my telegram No. 307, dated 10th April, amplified on 13th idem by Residency telegram No. 314. 3 Writing on the 9th April, the Political Agent forwarded Sheikh Mubarak’s t Sent to Foreign with Residency No. 12,4, letterf of same date and expressed the hone dated igth April 1908. that it WOuld be possible for US to do something for the Sheikh as he evidently had the matter far more at heart than any other of the current questions affecting his territorial rights vis a vis the Porte. 4. The above brief resumd brings me to Foreign Department telegram No. 377 of 16th June 1908, and I now beg to enclose copies of the correspondence J which has since passed between the Politi cal Agent and myself. It will he seen that in his letter of 15th June, Major Knox, after reporting the Sheikh’s reiterated request fora Committee of enquiry and his undertaking to abide by its_ decision, suggested a visit on his own part to Basrah. In reply he was authorised to proceed informally to Basrah in the “ Lawrence ” pri t (,) First Assistant Resident to Political Agent, No. ,898, dated ,6th June. (2) Political Agent to Resident, No. 3,0, dated ,5th June ,908, received 23rd June (3) Resident to Political Agent, Koweit through First Assistant, Bushire, telegram, dated 29th June ,908.

Before doing so he wrote twice again on 23rd and 24th June. On the first date he submitted an ad interim report, in reply to the Secretary of State’s tele gram, dated 12th June, in which the Sheikh’s case was again stated and his request for a joint Committee of enquiry repeated. His letter of 24th June enclosed a further communication from Sheikh Mubarak to me in reply to my letter to him of 7th_ June in which the Sheikh clubbed the question of quarantine arrangements with that of his Fao properties, and, after detailing his grievances in the latter case and repeating his request for a Commission of enquiry, proceeded to discuss the quarantine question in terms clearly intended to signify that unless we co-operated in the Fao matter he would not do so in regard to quarantine. On 17th July Major Knox reported the details of his visit to Basrah which may be allowed to speak for themselves. On 20th July after paying a passing visit to Fao on his return journey, Major Knox again reported. The informal nature of this visit did not of course admit of his making any exhaustive enquiry into the rights of the case, but such information as he was able to pick up sent him away with impressions unmistakably unfavourable to Sheikh Mubarak’s claims. 5. It will have been noticed that there are two separate claims at present under dispute, one with the Turkish Military authorities regarding that portion of the property contiguous to the periscope of the Fao Fort and involving the right of riparian reclamation : the other concerning the ownership of a piece of valuable ground at the northern extremity of the Sheikh’s estate. In regard to the former question Major Knox sympathises with the attitude of the Turkish military authorities and considers that they had good reason for destroying the Sheikh’s dam. Of the second claim he writes : “ It is quite a question whether Sheikh Mubarak has or has not committed a serious aggression, involving valuable property to the north of his estates. In this matter we have no possible jurisdiction or pretext for interference and the matter appears one entirely for the Turkish Courts to settle.” It is quite possible that Major Knox’s present estimate of the case is the correct one, but it seems to me that these claims can hardly be treated by us from an entirely detached point of view, and I doubt the expediency of our wash ing our hands of the matter on the strength of the impressions now formed by him. In fact he himself suggests at the close of his last communication that the execution of a careful survey and record of rights is probably the only means of laying the matter to rest. It is not clear however what agency he would expect to carry out these measures. To any one perusing the whole record it must be evident that both in regard to statements of fact and expressions of view it bristles with contradictions. In any case it is beyond dispute that the Sheikh is extremely sore in regard to the treatment he has received in the matter of his Fao properties and it is equally beyond question that in the past he has suffered much oppression both in connection with the protracted ircarceration of his Agent Abdul Aziz bin Salim, and the murder of his head watchman 4 years ago. Again we have his own and the Political Agent’s word for it that the matter touches the Sheikh much more closely than any of the current questions of owner ship affecting other localities in his reputed territory, such as Bubiyan, Um Kasr or Warba. It is further clear that our failure to give him the active assistance which he looks for in the present difficulty is prejudicing his attitude towards us in other important connections, the quarantine and the house-rent questions. That we have no jurisdiction in the matter goes without saying ; nor dees the Sheikh ask us to exercise any ; what he has consistently pressed for is a Committee of enquiry by the finding of which he agrees to abide. In spite therefore of the adverse conception of Sheikh Mubarak’s case to which Major Knox’s visit to Fao has brought him, I venture to express the hope3 that it may still be considered expedient as well as feasible in the interests of our general relations with Sheikh Mubarak, to endeavour to get the Porte to agree, in order to define once for all Sheikh Mubarak’s precise rights and thus save themselves and us trouble in the future, to the appointment of a Committee composed of persons agreeable to both parties to investigate the Sheikh’s claims exhaustively. The presence of Major Knox or His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah if not as a member of the Committee, then in order to watch the proceedings for the information of His Majesty’s Government, can, I trust, be pressed for. The above will indicate the trend of my personal views, but I realise that a great deal depends on the degree of importance which His Majesty’s Govern ment at present attach to the maintenance of cordial relations with Sheikh Mubarak, a factor which I am not in a position to appraise. 6. In conclusion, it is perhaps unnecessary for me to remind Government, in connection with the arguments of the Turkish military authorities regarding the minimum strategical requirements of the Fao Fort, that the very existence of the said Fort is a direct violation of the Treaty of Erzeroum of which Great Britain and Russia were the august witnesses and against which we have repeat edly demurred. It seems important not to lose sight of this fact at the present juncture and our existing relations with Russia may suggest means of making convenient use of the lever in order to strengthen our representations. It is possible that a friendly reminder of the status or want of status of the Fao Fort might incline the Porte to treat Mubarak with some indulgence in the present dispute in order to avoid drawing inconvenient attention to the question of their Fao fortifications generally. P.S. —After the above letter was despatched from Shiraz another letter (No. 428, dated 1st August 1908) was received from Major Knox giving cover to a letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. A copy of the latter letter is attached for the information of the Government of India, under telegraphic instructions from the Resident. The position of affairs is in no way altered by these letters. Copy of a letter No. i 8 g 8 , dated 16 th June igo 8 , from the First Assistant Resident, Persian Gulf, in charge current duties, to the Political Agent, Koweit. I have the honour to forward a copy of the marginally-noted telegram and to Foreign Department No. s -377, dated 16th request that you will furnish me with the June I5 ° 8 ' particulars asked for. My telegram No. 207, referred to, was despatched on receipt of your letter No. 95 of March 1908, and my letter No. 1214, on receipt of the correspondence forwarded under your demi-official letter of the 8th April 1908. My letter No. 1214, simply forwarded Sheikh Mobarak’s letter dated 7th Rabi I 1326 (8th April 1908) to the Govern ment of India. No. 310, dated Koweit, the 15th June 1908 (Confidential). From-MAJOR S. G. Knox, I. A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C. I. E., Political Resident in Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that Sheikh Mobarak has, at two interviews lately, laid great stress on the question of his Fao estates and I believe con templates a strong reference on the subject in reply to your letter re quarantine forwarded under cover of your letter No. 1802, dated the 7th June 1908. 3. The Sheikh assures me, but I find it difficult to credit his assurance, j that he has been promised, before my time, protection with regard to these estates. I had told him carefully explaining at the same time that it was a casual reference in a private letter from Mr. Crow, that the Consul at Basrah jV 0 believed that the real obstacle to a settlement in accordance with Sheikh Mobarak’s wishes is the opposition of the military officers of the Turkish adminis tration. 3. To combat this view, the Sheikh the other day directed his Secretary, Abdul Aziz, to read to me a report emanating from Basrah which said that His* Excellency the Wali had been unable tojobtain any reply from the Fariq either at4 Basrah or Baghdad, supporting his allegations with reference to the Sheikh’s alleged encroachment on the river. The Sheikh maintains that! he has all the subordinate officials on his side and that his only obstacle is His Excellency who wishes to extort money from him. 4. The Sheikh’s proposals appear, on the surface, eminently reasonable. He states that all he requires is an enquiry by a representative commission of Basrah notables at which he suggests that His Excellency, himself and the Basrah Consul should be present, either in person or by deputy. He states that he is quite ready to abide by the finding of that commission but that even if it decrees that the land is, as it is called, Tash, *.&lt;?., reclaimed land, he claims the right enjoyed by all riparian owners to pay a fixed sum for the privilege of re clamation and to be permitted thereafter to enjoy it in peace. Sheikh Mobarak, even goes further and says that, while utterly denying the reclamation, at least within the past 14 years, he will, for the sake of peace and quietness admit, without enquiry that the land is Tash and pay the fees claimed. But he asks that this should be done speedily to avoid further injury to the land. This last was in answer to my suggestion that it would be as well to await the reply of the British Government to the representations already made by him and forwarded by yourself. 5. Considering the grave importance that the Sheikh attaches to this ques tion, and his evident determination to put this difficulty forward as a stop to all our negotiations with him, I have the honour to propose a visit by myself, accompanied by some representative of the Sheikh, to Fao to examine the con dition of the broken embankments complained of and the amount of injury likely to be caused thereby This would, in the natural course, be followed by a visit to Basrah, where I could, through His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, place the matter before His Excellency and endeavour to effect some sort of settlement, even if only a temporary one, pending the reconsideration of the question or, at least, obtain from His Excellency some definite statement of the reason? or regulations, owing to which His Excellency has forbidden the repair of these embankments, 6. I understand that the R.l.M.S. “Lawrence” is at present at Basrah and would suggest that she might be employed for the purpose of the up river trip which should not take more than a week at the outside. It is difficult to imagine that the Turkish authorities could offer any valid objection to my walking round Sheikh Mobarak’s Fao properties. It would be necessary to respect the quarantine regulations at Fao which might cause a slight delay. Should His Excellency refuse to receive me in the company of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, there would be no necessity for me to appear at all and in any case I should, of course, be guided entirely by His Biitannic Majesty’s Consul in all communications made and the manner of making them to His Excellency.

That report I have now the honour to submit, herewith, in duplicate. ■Z 5 • would ask that this letter and enclosures may be read in connection with my letter No, 334, dated the 24th June 1908, to your address.REPORT. On the claims of Sheikh Mobarak against the Turkish authorities at Basrah in respect of the alleged encroachment by Turkish soldiers on his lands at Fao. The facts of the case, as represented by Sheikh Mobarak, are as follows :— In the beginning of the year 1908, a Turkish corvette was sent to Fao and the soldiers of the Fort by night destroyed an embankment, enclosing a portion of Sheikh Mobarak’s lands at Fao. Various reasons have been alleged for this action but two contradictory ones now stand out:— , 0 ). that the land was newly reclaimed land. This contention is evidently implied in His Excellency the Wali of Basrah’s ambiguous letter, of which a copy and translation was forwarded with my letter Vo. i8i, dated the i ^th Aoril 1908, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ; (2) that the cultivation on the land of which the embankment was broken was obstructing the view from the fort and that a clear space of 600 metres was required all round the fort for defensive purposes. Mr. Consul Crow makes a casual reference in a private letter to me, which I quote “ Sorry I could not do more for Mobarak, but the military people at Constantinople are absolutely opposed to any encroachment on the perimeter of the Fao fort. The local autho- rities seem well-disposed to the Sheikh, though the arms traffic is a sore point and they think he encourages it.” v Sheikh Mobarak declares that the embankment in question is certainly very old and^ that from the^ land which^ it protects, the mud was taken to build the fort. He,says that it runs in a continuation—interrupted however by a creek—and to the north of the fort embankment; and that, when the fort was built, he and &lt;-he fort authorities combined amicably to embank or repair embankments together. He says that, since that date, 23 years ago, he has carried out yearfy and even more frequent repairs, as occasion demanded, to the embankment * and * in another letter he gives the age of the embank- his men have never been interfered with ment at 14 years. unt ;i nQW&gt; In support of this contention, he has produced copies of certain corres- t Appendix b. pondence f which took place in the early- f r, , ' „ . part of the year between His Excellency the Wall o Basrah and the Kaim-mokam of Fao. It must be said that these do not appear to be officia copies, but they were probably furnished by the Kaim- mokam of Fao to the Sheikh. Sheikh Mobarak explains that certificated copies of I urkish records are not procurable. In that correspondence, the Kaim-mokam corroborates the destruction by night of the embankment by Turkish soldiers—in itself a sufficiently lawless and high-handed proceeding, for which it would not perhaps be too much to demand the punishment of the officer commanding the fort and the Sheikh s statement that the embankment is an old one. The letters ot the Kaim-mokam also indicate that the nearness of the cultivation to the fort is the reason why the embankment was destroyed. A Turkish Commission, composed of the following members The Commander of the Turkish corvette; The Kaim-mokam of Fao; A Yus-bashi from Basrah ; sat on the question. No Koweit representative was present, according to Sheikh Mobarak. The embankment had not been repaired after the damage done to them by the Turkish soldiers and have not been repaired yet. The Commission expressed the opinion that there was no necessity to interfere with the embank ments, but that they obstructed the view from the fort and that future repairs should not be executed [vide Political Agent’s letter No. g=t, dated 2rd March igc8, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf).I was surprised at the time Sheikh Mobarak informed me of the decision that he made no attempt to have this order questioned, but it would seem that the Commission were not unanimous and that the views of the military member on the purely military question carried the day against his two colleagues who were not disposed to agree with him. The Sheikh was apparently awaiting the end of his correspondence with His Excellency the Wali of Basrah. The ambiguous letter from His Excellency already referred to above dated 31st March (copy and translation forwarded with my letter No. 181, dated 15th April) seems to have roused Sheikh Mobarak to further exertions and he wrote asking the Political Resident to protect him in the enjoyment of his rights under date 8th April 1908, forwarded with my No. 181, dated 15th April 1908. The Sheikh now seeks to upset the finding of that Commission and to that end requires the appointment of a fresh Commission of Basrah notables. He suggests the following names :r— ^ The Nakib of Basrah. Haji Mahmud Pasha, wakil-i-imlak as SanI’a. Abad ur Razzak Chalabi, Rais al Baladiya, and other men of their standing. He asks that, at the sitting of the new Commission, His Excellency the Wali of Basrah and himself should either be present or represented by deputy, and he attaches great importance to the presence of a British official, preferably, the Resident in the Persian Gulf or his deputy or His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah. He asks that the new Commission may definitely decide whether the lands of which the embankment was broken, is newly reclaimed or not? And that a definite question may be put to the Turkish authorities “ why he should not be allowed, even if the land is newly reclaimed, to pay the usual fees, like any other riparian proprietor and enjoy the land in peace, vis., by re pairing his embankment ?” If the question of the military safety of the fort is raised, he washes to argue the question, to contend that the fort is safe and to ask why the perimeter laid dowm in the correspondence of which copies, again apparently unofficial, with translations are attached to this report as Appendix A, should be extended to 606 mbtres, depriving him of his property without his consent and without compensation. For this reason, it would seem advisable to have a representative of the Turkish army also present at the meeting of the Commission. In Appendix A, the head of the military Commission, who built the fort in 1885, appears to have stated that a plot of ground, 230 metres square, was all that would be required. The Sheikh presses for an early decision, as the delay in repair to his em bankments is causing serious damage to his lands at Fao. Further details than the above it will be impossible to procure without a visit to the spot by a British official and a survey of some kind. APPENDIX A.

KNOX, Major, Political Agent, Koweit, APPENDIX B. Translation. This is a copy of the answer of the Kaim-mokam at Fao to the questions of the Walayat, dated 1st Nissan 324, letter No. 32. The arrival with honour of your exalted order dated 1st Nissan 324, No. 32 on the subject of the property enjoyed by and pertaining to its honoured owner, Mobarak Pasha us Subah, situate in Fao. To protect it from destruction by water he (Sheikh Mobarak) constructed an embankment and the soldiers of the Fort by night destroyed the embankment. They claim that the land is taken from the river and is the property of the Gov ernment. And the facts appear from examination and at the time of the enquiry. The embankment about which the question is put is in Fao and as to the ownership of it, what appears from the enquiry from disinterested persons and the people who have infomation is that these embankments are of old time for the protection and preservation and the final issue of orders is reserved to your high opinion. Signature of the Kaim-mokam of Fao. And on 25th Rabi al Awmal 1326, H.—igth Nissan 324, and from the letter of the Wali to the Kaim-mokdm at Fao. This question must be presented before the Imperial threshhold. We enjoin upon you as to the truth of it, before a great responsibility comes upon you. The Kaim-mokam of Fao replied. Certainly all the enclosed lands enter into the Fao property, because in old times they used to embank them and repair them against the overflow of the waters for the purpose of protecting the date trees and, as for the embankment which the soldiers broke, it is from the lands of these embankments and therefore, if there should be against it an objection because of its propinquity to the Fort, then the order pertains to your knowledge.

In continuation of correspondence epding with your office telegram, dated the gth instant, on the subject of Sheikh Mobarak’s Fao properties, 1 have the honour to report that I arrived in R, I. M* S, “ Lawrence ” at Basrah on the morning of the 15th instant.2 On the following day, through the courtesy of His Britannic Maiesty’s Consul, Basrah, a visit from His Excellency the Wali, at which I had the advantage of being present, was arranged at the Consulate. 3. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul asked His Excellency if he would be so kmd as,to favour us with the views of the local Ottoman authorities on the following question as Sheikh Mobarak’s complaints were continual and the facts oUh^case 0 ^ ^ anX10US for me to re P ort as full y as possible on the The question was posed in the following way Why did the Turkish soldiers break down the embankment erected by Sheikh Mobarak and recently repaired by him ?” Was it on account of the land being newly reclaimed ? Was it onaccountof the embankment proving prejudicial to the safety His , ExceIlenc y replied that the embankment was broken down by the soldiers under the immediate orders of the Commandant of the Fao fort and in consequence of some rather ambiguous orders issued by the Commandant at Basrah and that the question was largely a military one. The claim of the aat h°nties which was, so His Excellency said, supported by the findim? of the first commission of enquiry consisting of the Fort Commandant the .He eC fM Shdkh M f nTt an,i , ,he °f Kao, was to the ertect that bheikh Mobarak had by advancing his embankment enclosed some 39,000 square mbtres of newly reclaimed Tash land, which was Govern ment property and was required for military purposes,V*, the safety 'one of the fort This safety zone, so His Excellency assmed us, he had ascertained from the local Commandant had been recently laid down by regulation Jo be a distance of 230 metres radiating from the Fort h all directions for a fire zonl and for a second “ view” zone as one might call it a similar distance of 600 £d bLn a^s^edbv thr T? F ° Vt m aU dire u ctions ' His Excellency said that he had been assured by the military surveyors that the land that Sheikh Mobarak had attempted to reclaim lay within the safety zones. 5. I asked my colleague to inform His Excellency that Sheikh Mobarak was under the impression that this committee had come to a different conclusion vzs that the disputed ground formed part of the Fao pro P ertierbu“ the 10 ,he safe,r of the Fort - Toihrs HiS E * 6 I said to my colleague that possibly His Excellency might like to hear from me what were Sheikh Mobarak’s pretentions with regard to the land in question and His Excellency courteously expressed his willingness to hear anything I might have to say on the subject. On this I said that Sheikh Mobarak claimed that the piece of land in question was of long standing and at any rate within recent times had not been reclaimed from the river as the rrmr! k 1 ha hifs\V^ b l dt K he ^ rt , Wa '5 ^ b “' yeL W ag„ h 3 hat Sheikh Mobarak claimed that the enbankment, recently demolished the Turkish soldiers had been erected fourteen yelrs ago and had be ^ repaired three and four times annually without interference or exoortulatiln from the Ottoman loca! authorities. I added that Sheikh Mobaral/requested the appointment of a commission of Basrah landed proprietors to adjudicate nnr 1 UeStl0I lr 0 p Whe H her th f and In dls P ute was newly reclaimed land or 1’ 1 , ^ av . e I s Excellency the names of the notables suggested by the Sheikh and detaded ,n the report that accompanied my letter No. a^ol dated he 23rd June 1908 to your address. I did not consider it advisable at this juncture t0 ,TT n th6 ? h ® lkh s demands as to the presence of a British representative while the commission was sitting. lepresentative f A , the , Sheikh waa even ready for the sake of peace and quietness to admit that the land was newly reclaimed land, provided that he deceived permission after payment of the usual taxes to reclaim, enclose and cultSe the property in question. H.s Excellency seemed to offer no objection toThe appointment of the Commission and expressly said that, if the mili ary auSoti tles abandoned their claim, there would be no difficulty raised by the Govern, ment to selling, as he put it, the new land to Sheikh Mobarak. *IO 7. As regards the military claim, I informed His Excellency that Sheikh Mobarak had also a reply to make to their claims, viz., that 20 years ago when the Commission came to construct the Fort, Sheikh _ Mobarak and his brother had petitioned to His Excellency asking for a definite statement of the amount of land that was required for the building of the Fort. _ The petition had been referred to the Majliss who had, in their turn, sent it to the head of the Fort commission. That official had replied in writing and Sheikh Mobarak held a copy of his letter that the land required for the Fort was a square piece of ground of which the length was to be 230 metres and the breadth likewise and no more. t 8. His Excellency had already, in the course of conversation, alluded to the despatch of the last military mission that discussed the matter of the land with Sheikh Mobarak at Fao on the 4th July but professed to be ignorant of the finding of that commission. I informed His Excellency that Sheikh Mobarak had told me that he had discussed the matter with the Commission and that, while he was of course unaware of the actual finding of that Commission, he had understood from them that they were on the whole favourable to his views and would report in that sense to their superiors, that they admitted the land in dispute to be the Sheikh’s property enjoyed for many years and that with regard to the safety of the Fort, it was true that a zone of 600 mbtres and even more was required by the regulations but that the Fao Fort did not, in any sense comply with the requirements, as on the west flank of the Fort, there was no safety zone whatever as the date gardens come right up to the west wall of the fort. 9. His Excellency replied that, if the military authorities proved to be of that opinion, there would be no difficulty whatever in meeting Sheikh Mobarak’s wishes if they were put forward clearly and concisely in the manner that he had heard them formulated by me. His Excellency said that Sheikh Mobarak had inundated him with a mass of vague correspondence, now threatening, row complaining, from which it was difficult to ascertain his actual wishes. I assured His Excellency that, if he so desired, I should be glad to use such influ ence as I possessed with Sheikh Mobarak to induce him to put his requests in clear and comprehensive language which would be submitted to His Excellency through my colleague. His Excellency was good enough to express the pleasure with which he would receive Sheikh Mobarak’s representations through this channel 10. Finding His Excellency so well disposed to listen to our side of the story my colleague, at my suggestion, asked His Excellency if there would be any objection to my visiting Sheikh Mobarak’s Fao estates unofficially and especially the disputed ground, as a visit to the spot would enable me, in my report to superior authority, to elucidate the position far better than any number of complaining letters or even conversations. His Excellency replied that there would be no objection whatever to my visit. 11. His Excellency asked if I could inform him why Sheikh Mobarak, who already enjoyed such large estates, attached such great importance to this tiny little strip of waste land. To this I said that I could only reply that Sheikh Mobarak was at heart a peasant and held tenaciously to every foot of his Fao lands. I instanced to His Excellency the absolute refusal of Sheikh Mobarak to sell, lease or even for pecuniary compensation limit his right to plant date trees in such a way as would completely destroy the amenities of the cool N. W. wind for our unfortunate telegraph officials at Fao. 12. It only remained for me to thank His Excellency for the courteous patience with which he had been good enough to listen to my representations. A visit was arranged for me the following day at which no matters of importance were even touched on. My colleague proposes to visit the Turkish Commandant alone and try and ascertain from him what is the military point of view and what finding the latest commission arrived at, and I shall have the honour to submit a report in continuation of the present one after I have received this information after my visit to Fao in the company of either Sheikh Mobarak or his representative. My Basrah colleague concurs with me in thinking that, after the clear statement made by His Excellency with regard to my visit at Fao, no possible objection can be raised to it hereafter.No. 399, dated Koweit, the 20th July 1908 (Confidential). From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my Confidential No. 396. dated the 17th July 1908, I have the honour to report that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah informed me, before leaving Basrah, that he had interviewed the Military Com mandant at Basrah and discovered from him that the military authorities had by no means abandoned their claim to the disputed ground and were quite unable to abandon it. _ Indeed it appeared from the interview that, as Mr. Consul Crow had already intimated, the opposition to Sheikh Mobarak’s views was mainly from the military authorities and that the civil authorities were disposed to be complacent, if they could only discover a way to be so. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul was good enough to promise me a letter giving the results of his conversa tion with the Military Commandant and a copy of that letter will be forwarded immediately on receipt. « t 2 ‘ ° n t » e , morn ! n g of the i 9 t h July, I left Basrah in the R.I.M.S T^r aW n nC ® down river. We halted for a few minutes opposite Failiya, Sheikh Khazal s river residence, where Sheikh Mobarak’s launch was anchored, to enable me to send Moolla Abdulla, the Agency munshi, to communicate with cu •, u u and inform h ' m ot our movem ents. Moolla Abdulla failed to see the Sheikh who was on shore but, from the steamer’s ladder, informed the Sheikh’s Secretary of all that was necessary and returned on board the “ Lawrence” immediately He had been carefully instructed not to go on shore nor even on board the Sheikh s steamer so as to avoid all possible quarantine difficulties with the lurkish quarantine officer at Fao. 3. W e proceeded down river to a spot, pointed out as the boundary between the Fao and Ma amir properties, whence I proceeded to the shore in the steam cutter, while the “ Lawrence ” resumed her course to Fao village and finally anchored opposite the Telegraph buildings. 4. I landed at the spot, indicated to me by my chaprassi, Hamad, who is an inhabitant of this part of the country, and was met immediately by one of Sheikh Mobarak’s cultivators, one Inwaihi Dishman. I was accompanied by Sub-lieutenant Corser from R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence,” Moolla Abdulla and one chuprassi, the aforenamed Hamad. Inwaihi Dishman led us a little way inland and we made our w’ay over three or four separate blocks of date gardens, each divided from the other bv a creek. We worked down the last creek to the river again and at the point where creek and river met found ourselves in a rough open enclosure, where there were perhaps a dozen retainers of Sheikh Mobarak all fully armed. _ I asked for the headman and two men presented themselves. One was Badar bin Muhammad ash Shathi who had just been relieved of his charge and the relief was Brahim bin Abdul Jabbar who said that he was at the head of 20 men. 5. I was informed that the quarrel arose over a small piece of land at the outlet of the creek. This creek looked as if it had been straightened out and had originally curled southwards but such land as had been enclosed by this process was of very small extent and was uncultivated. Even if properly reclaimed and fenced in. it could not have contained a dozen date trees. From thence, I crossed the creek into the Ma’ amir property to see if we could find any of the Ma’amir cultivators to see what they would say on the subject. There were no indications on their side of an armed detachment and we only saw three unarmed men, two of wffiom were on the opposite side of the next creek and positively disclaimed all knowledge of the dispute. The third man who came up at the moment we persuaded to accompany us to the spot previously indicated but he also absolutely refused to commit himself to any statement of the causes of quarrel, much less to his view of the Fao Ma’amir boundary. Our stay at this spot could not have exceeded ten minutes and I embarked again wondering why so very small and worthless a piece of ground should have occasioned such bitter quarrelling. I was informed that the creek on which the detachment was posted was called Nahar-i-Moosa bin Marzuk al Abbadi.6. It was not long that I was permitted to remain in this state of doubt. In the course of my stay at Fao, I was assured by the local gossip that it was an open secret that the creek on which the detachment was posted was not the “ Nahar-i-Moosa ” but the “ Nahar-i-Ghath-ban ” and that Sheikh Mobarak has taken from the Ma’amir property and added to his own a large block of date garden probably 100 yards wide and stretching from the river on the east side to the marshes on the west. Which version is the true one it is difficult to say, but there is no doubt that a large tract of extremely vah 'ble and well cultivated land is in dispute and it will be necessary to move with extreme caution before w’e lend our support to what may quite likely be a piece of serious lawless aggres sion. 7. I next proceeded down river and landed at the Telegraph buildings and delivered a letter from the quarantine officer at Basrah to the quarantine officer at Fao. As I had no motive for concealment, I expressed a wish to see the Kaim- mokam but it was midday and he was taking his siesta. 8. I again embarked and we went down stream to the house of Abdur Rahim bin Haji Rashid who is Sheikh Mobarak’s principal Fao agent and an inhabitant of this part of the country. Here we were met by the news that Abdur Rahim was out and would not be back till sunset, so I despatched my chuprassi Hamad with a local man to go by land to the Ras an Nabt, the extreme southern end of the Fao properties, where Abdur Rahim was stated to be, while we proceeded thither by sea, so that we could catch him on his return journey whether by sea or land. 9 I was now accompanied by the Telegraph nakhoda one Yasin but we failed to find Abdur Rahim who had left a little before Yasin in the dinghy reached his objective. 10. We then returned a short way up river and proceeded to a house north of the Turkish fort which was said to overlook the land in dispute between Sheikh Mobarak and military authorities of the Fao fort. This house belonged to Ahmed bin Rizq of whom mention has already been made in the correspondence relating to Warba island, and here I was, with the usual Arab hospitality prompt ly made welcome. As we proceeded westwards up the little creek bounded on either side by reeds, nakoda Yasin pointed out to me the broken bund and informed me that it had been constructed in 25 hours by 1,000 men of whom 500 came from the Persian side of the river, while the soldiers were afraid to interfere. 11. The Arabs—and there were a matter of a dozen or so at Ahmed bin Rizq’s house—informed me that, in their position, they w r ere between the devil and the deep sea and were at their wits’ ends to know what to do. If they carried out Sheikh Mobarak’s orders, they incurred the hostility of the Fort soldiers and, if they did not, they had Sheikh Mobarak punishing them. A garden, overlapping Ahmed bin Rizq’s date garden and house to the north, was inclosed and planted, so I ascertained, within the last six years according to one account and within the last three years according to another. The significance of this will appear later. 12. We had been sitting in Ahmed bin Rizq’s date garden a matter of 20 minutes when Sheikh Mobarak’s agent, Abdur Rahim arrived, and w'e inspected the ground enclosed by the offending embankment. Abdur Rahim informed me that the foundations of the old embankment were laid fourteen years ago but tha- nothing had been done subsequently until last autumn when the whole embankt ment was constructed in one day. It was destroyed in the winter and had not been repaired. 13. The ground inclosed to the east of Ahmed bin Rizq’s house has never been cultivated and though it would, no doubt, be extremely valuable, if reclaimed, an inspection of the spot is quite sufficient to satisfy any reasonable person that nothing of greater value than reeds has been taken out of it up to date. I am, as a military man, entirely in sympathy with the local military authorities in forbidding its cultivation. No soldier would permit it for a moment. That, at the same time, the fort also is entirely valueless either for attack or defence is perhaps beside the question. It appears•3 to me extremely doubtful whether the embankment was ever erected before last autumn and Abdur Rahim’s statement is valuable as showing that Sheikh Mobarak has not steadily been repairing the embankment three or four times per annum for the last fourteen years. The embankment stretching from Ahmed- bin-Rizq s house to the Fort creek which does protect a date garden is sound and in good repair and no one ever attempted to maintain that the Turkish soldiers touched it. cu -i u 4 \ 7 u e ‘ n , s P ect '. on the g round also disproves another wild statement of Sheikh Mobarak s, mz., that if the Fort garrison fired northwards they would be tiring into the Telegraph buildings and inhabited villages. The Fort fire is masked on the west and on the west only. No rifle bullet could carry to culti vated or inhabited ground either north, east, or south. Within rifle range there 18 ju'? e3 m e P t drear y. swamp land from which, however, the river is receding and which will be potentially valuable for date cultivation purposes after no' very great lapse of time. ■' t ‘l, 1 was just getting up to leave when the Yusbashi from the Fort came up to Ahmed-bm-Rizq s house and we sat and talked through an interpreter for a quarter of an hour. By the courtesy of this gentleman, I was permitted to proceed along the bund of Ahmed-bin-Rizq to the Fort creek though he would not give me permission to enter the Fort which indeed I had not asked for. He explained to me what the quarrel had been about and said that, while they did not object to the actual enclosure, if it was thought advisable to enclose this piece merely as an additional precaution against flood water, they could not permit its cultivation in any shape or form. We returned to the R. I M S Lawrence that evening without mishap or difficulty of any kind. 16. I had heard from Mr. Lobo, the clerk in charge of the Telegraph station at Fao, tnat the Kaim-mokam of Fao had been making anxious enquiries about me and my movements and I thought jt best to proceed at once in the morning and give a full and frank explanation to him of my presence there. The Kaim-mokam s house is next to the Telegraph quarters and I sent Moolla Abdulla over to say that I should be very glad to see him and give an explana tion of my presence there if he would receive me. A courteous reply was sent and 1 proceeded attended by Moolla Abdulla and one chuprassi. My reception was all that could be desired and I explained to the Kaim-mokam that Sheikh Mobarak s complaints were continual and I wished to try and get at the facts as f u f P°® Slble &gt; tbat I h a d ™ authority of any kind and pretended to none, that riis excellency the Wah had said that he saw no objection to my visiting the spot on my return to Koweit. The Kaim-mokam, Sharif Bey, was so bu«y explaining the Turkish view of the two cases Fao—Ma’amir and the Fao Fort and the broken embankment that I may be permitted to doubt whether he paid much attention to the explanation I afforded him. He returned my visit immediately at the Telegraph quarters and we parted on excellent terms. cu U P’ tbe P 03 ' 1 * 011 ’ s briefly thus. It is quite a question whether bheikh Mobarak has or has not committed a serious aggression involving valu able property to the north of his estates. In this matter we have no possible !^ ns 1 c V ct ‘ on or P retext f° r interference and the matter appears one entirely for the Turkish courts to settle. 18- To the south, no real damage has been done at all. Sheikh Mobarak has erected a bund round what is at present worthless marsh land and the lurkish soldiers have destroyed it and for a very good reason too. dfbe question of right is at best obscure and it is certainly possible to argue that by Turkish law all that land belongs to the Ottoman Government which permits or refuses to permit reclamation, as it thinks fit. From the Sheikh’s letters one would imagine that his estates were gradually passing over into the hands of the Turks. This is not so, it is a question of fresh acquisitions which the I urks refuse to permit him to acquire. In many directions, notably a strip of land to the noith of the Telegraph buildings and the gardens to the north of Ahmed bin-Rizq’s house they appear to have been very generous to him and to have foregone reclamation taxes which they might, in all lawfulness have claimed. Owing to the constant silting up of the river at the mouth, the Faoestates are sure to be a fruitful source of quarrels in the future and it seems hardly likely that any Government, with any pretentions to law or civilization will accept, without limitation, Sheikh Mobarak’s claim that his boundary is the r river and that, as it recedes, his estates follow it without leave asked of any body, The counsel of perfection would be to have the whole estate carefully surveyed and a record of rights prepared and clear legal opinion obtained as to what the law in the Ottoman dominions really is on this subject of alluvial lands. Throughout my examination of the case, I have been greatly impressed with the extreme courtesy shewn me by all the Ottoman officials I have met, aad the general conclusion I have come to is that at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, the Turkish Government stands in quite as much need of protection against Sheikh Mobarak, as Sheikh Mobarak does against Turkish aggression. 19. I enclose a rough sketch drawn from memory and not to scale of the land to the north of the Fao Fort giving a notion of the position of the land in dispute.i6 Copy of a letter No. g, dated the 25th July igo8, from His Britannic Majesty^ Consul, Basrah, to the Political Agent, Koweit. In compliance with your request, I have the honour to report that on the 17th instant, I interviewed Tahir Pasha, Commandant of Basrah, on the subject of Sheikh Mobarak’s claims at Fao. He entirely confirmed the Vali’s assertion that this was purely a military question. He maintained that the Government had a perfect right not only to make good their present claim but also to expropriate a considerably larger portion of Mobarak’s property, of which he possessed no title deeds. The land in the proximity of the Fort is said by the Turks to have been originally sub merged and unfit for cultivation and when the water retires all such land is claimed as Government property. He suggested that if the Sheikh proved recalcitrant in the matter the claims of the Government might be very largely increased. With regard to the destruction of the ' bund,” the Commandant informed me that only two sides had been overthrown. These had been newly erected and interfered with the efficiency of the fort, being well within the circle with a radius of 230 metres, which had been deemed necessary for the maintenance of the position. In spite of this the military authorities had at present no intention of asserting any claim to the lands behind the Fort, although they lay within this zone. Tahir Pasha considers that it is quite impossible for the Government to reduce their demands which he believes are extremely moderate and reason able. He also says that very little injury has been inflicted on the Sheikh’s lands, the partial destruction of the new Bund only affecting the enclosure of a barren uncultivated strip, to the ownership of which M ubarak was never entitled.

The Sheikh then appealed for British protection, and repres entations were then made at Constantinople which resulted, in the issue by the Porte of instructions to the Vali of Bus rah to propose arbitration, which, on the intervention of the British Resident, Mubarak accepted. Hereupon the Vali of Bus rah was notified that the arbitration would be conducted under the supervision of H.M's .Consul at Busrah, who would be consulted. at all stages of the proceedings and attend the sittings of the Court. Consul Crow reported in September,1903, that an amicable compromise had been effected, in virtue of which Mubarak was recognised as the sole owner of the Fao property.

A few enquiries and remonstrances were made and hence all this complaining. Sheikh Jabir informed me that he did not tell his father this but was letting me know privately. 4. I was obliged to reply that no doubt the Sheikh felt justified in making an outcry even on the slightest threat of Turkish encroachment, as, if it was not for his persuading the English to make enquiries, these slight threats mffiht develop into serious complications.

Tour telegram 12th January and letter 14th January about Mubarek’s land at Fao. Wali says he will do his best to smooth over difficulties provided no harm is done to the fort, hut he states Mubarek is reclaiming new ground and not merely repairing old “seddas” as represented. He has recovered this year from the river 39,000 square dras (Jhat means a patch of about 130 yards by 85 yards, the land dra being 19 inches) on the north side of the fort, and opened a channel besides near the fort itself. Before land is reclaimed from a river in Turkey it is usual to obtain permission from Government and pay something for it. This has not been done. The matter is engaging the atten tion of the Palace, and they are in correspondence with the Wali on the subject. The Wali has replied to the Palace telegrams that he is making the necessary enquiries. The whole question has been referred by the Wali to the Adminis trative Council, and he proposes to send a member of the Council to Fao to survey the place. The Wali will let me hear further when the matter has been gone into. I suggested privately that the Wali should tell me how much royalty the Turkish Government wanted, as I might then be able to facilitate matters, and Mubarek would do well to consult the Wali direct as to permission and pay ment. His statement to us seems disingenuous. I am a little embarrased by Mubarek himself, who during the feast (14th January to 19th January) began his work again in spite of orders not to, and would pay no attention to what the Turkish Government said. Your telegram to me was dated 12th January, so Mubarek took the law into his own hands about two days after jrour reference to me. He is really an “ impossible client ”! What is the Arabic of your translation “600 metres clear space”. I fancy there may be some error. Our surface measure here is the “dra”, which is 19 inches. There is a lineal dra of 36 inches, but used for cloth only. The metre is not used locally for land measure, though, if measured by the military people, the 600 ? in the perimeter of the fort may well be the metre as we know it. I will do what I can, hut you see it isn’t easy under existing conditions. Dated the 28th January 1908 (demi-official). From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, F. E. Crow, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. Many thanks for your letter of 24th January regarding the Fao pro* perties. “ Mittr ” was the word used to me, both by the Sheikh and his writer, who after my interview brought me the old partition deed and went into explanations with plan and pencil. The word Zira was never used, and it seemed clear to me that they knew, and were using the French word “ metre”. I am sending your letter over to Knox, who is now back. I hear from Fao that the Turks have demolished one of the offending bunds, hut in his letter received last night Knox makes no mention of this. It is as you know very difficult in these matters to get our friends to be at all precise, but I went over the fort “ clearance” point again and again to make sure that I had the right details, as stated by Sheikh Mubarek at the time.r ^°' 67 &gt; dated Koweit, the 3 rd February 1908 .

Such damage is ttl p m ra , e ’ i 01 the chance of Sheikh Mubarak obtaining compensation from 11s 18 sinalI indeed. Sheikh Mubarek declares that the bunds are eleven b rs ? ,, ar l d ^^.^hcy have merely been repaired. He also informs me that an e tort military authorities built them together eleven years ago. q, .Jh •^ r s re gards the third reason, it would be interesting to learn when eikh Mubarek received clear official instructions that he was not to build ®Embankments, and even if he did do so contrary to orders, he may plead that it is impossible to obey such orders, as he cannot stand by and see his property go to ruin for want of proper repair. His constant complaint to me is that the Turks will not allow him to exercise the right that each and every one—the meanest proprietor on the river—has, viz., to protect his property against the devastation not only of the river, as in the case of more fortunate proprietors higher up river, but also of the sea. 6. It is perhaps worth noticing that the Kaim Mokam of Fao, the highest local civil authority, is apparently on Sheikh Mubarek’s side in this affair. 7 . The letter, of which a translation is forwarded, may read strangely and appear peremptory in tone, but too great importance should not be attached to that,^ as Sheikh Mubarek was perfectly friendly in discussing the matter, and the ambiguous phrase about searching for a way to preserve his honour is simply a vague threat intended to produce an impression, and there is not the slightest doubt that Sheikh Mubarek thoroughly appreciates the advantages that accrue to him from our protection of Koweit. Translation. Dated 29 th Thi ul Haj-lst February 1908 . From— Seikh Mubakek us Subah, Ruler of Koweit, To—The Political Agent, Koweit. After compliments —Before this we have informed the Consul-General and yourself about the interference of the Turkish Government in the cultivation of my land and the preservation of my land by embankments from the damage caused by vater, and the Consul General said that he would inform the Consul of Basrah of the news. Now the Turkish soldiers who are in their fort at Eao by night burst onto my lands and broke the bunds that protect my lands from the water in about forty places, and the water came in on my date trees and destroyed a portion of my date trees, and it may be further anticipatedlthat more4 BBSS* damage may be done and tbe Kaim Mokam of Fab informed the Waliand also nay agents informed the Wali by telegram, and the Wali did not stop this busi ness, and your honour knows that I and my town and my property which is in Basrah and all that concerns me is in your protection, and such matters are happening to my harm both in possessions and honour, and if your protection is only for the town of Koweit, tbe protection of Koweit does not benefit me at all. What benefits me is the preservation of my honour. If I do not obtain from your protection my honour, at least you might demand from the Turks that they should treat me as well as they do all their proprietors of land—and not permit that such occurrences should take place upon me and I should endure them for many days and with patience as in the case of the occasion which happened last year on my Fao property and I informed you of it. My agents drove them off my property and they destroyed of my date crop 6,000 (?) by thieving. 1 informed you of the matter and you yourself from Bushire went to Fao and came here and we informed you of the affair which had happened. Then when matters of this kind happen and no protec tion is obtained from you for my honour and property, I shall be compelled to look out for myself a eondition that will protect my honour and my property and my land. Then it is incumbent on me that I should present this before you. Then so that your knowledge may embrace this affair, I have presented this letter to you and await your order and may you remain guarded. No. 56 , dated Koweit, the 2 nd February 1908 (demi-official). Prom— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent at Koweit, To—P. E. Crow, Esq., His Britannic .Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. I have received copies of your letter to Cox of date 24 th January, together with his letter of the 14 th January and final reply of 28 th January. I now send you a translation of Mubarek’s letter handed to me by him to-day. He is just sending his steam-launch up to Fao with the famous Abdul Aziz bin Salim to see what can be done. 2 . I followed your suggestion and told Mubarek that he would do well to consult the Wali as to permission and payment. Mubarek scouted tbe idea that he was reclaiming new land from the river, and maintained, as he did before Cox, that he was merely repairing old bunds, and that he and the military authorities had built them together eleven years ago. Mubarek may be an impossible client, but it would appear from his letter that he has the Kaim Mckam, who is supposed to be the chief civil author ity in Fao, on his side, and the highhandedness of erecting a low embankment in peace time, which can do little or no harm to the safety of the fort and which can easily be destroyed if there is any real encroachment, would seem as nothing compared to the highhandedness of the soldiers who let in flood water and destroy valuable property before there has been any real adjudi cation. It does seem to me that there is all the difference in the world between the two actions: one is a slight encroachment which can easily be remedied, and the other sounds like a wanton destruction of property for which there is not the least chance of getting compensation. Mubarek too may quite reason ably say that his action in spite of orders to the contrary was forced upon him by floods which even the Wali of Basrah cannot control. Q. I. 0. P. O.—No. 5469 F.
