(Received June 17) Danish Legation, London June 15 1911. Lr. Secretary of State, The Royal Geographical Society, an old and well known institution, having His Majesty the i\ing of Denmark for its high protector and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince for its President, is desirous of sending a small scienti fic expedition to Oman and Hadramaut (Arabia) in October next. I enclose a translation into English of a letter dated the 7th instant, by which the society has asked the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs for his assistance to obtaixi tho necessary facilities, and which also indicates the purpose and composition of the expedition. The country in question belonging to the sphere of influence of the British Government, 1 have been directed to ascertain whether His Majesty's Government would have any objection to the sending out of the said expedition, and if not to request that you would be so good as to cause the British representative in the above-mentioned country to be notified of the expedition, and to be invited to re ceive the same favourably and, if required, to give to the members of the expedition their kind assistance and pro tection. In submitting this matter to you, I venture to hope that you will be able to meet the wish of ray Government. I have etc., (signed) C. Brun.Royal Danish Geographical Society to the Ministry of Foreign affairs. (Translation). The Royal Danish Geographical Socioty having decided by its ”comite” for geographical expeditions|:o send a scientific expedition to Oman and Hadramaut in October next, the said 'Comite' has the honour to ask the Ministry of Foreign affairs to be good enought to assist the expedition by diplomatic means. •Lhe expedition, according to the plan laid down for it, will have to leave Denmark about the 1st October next, and will pe composed of M.M.J.H. Davidson, Lieutenant in the Danish artillery, and M.Barclay Raunkjaer, a student of arts. Especially M.Davidson, the leader of the expedtion is quite well acquainted with the Arabic language. The ex pedition will return to Denmark in April or May 1912. The basis of operation will be the land about and back of Muscat towards the great desert, and also the parts of Hadramaut adjacent to Oman, i.e. the South Eastern Araoixv. The expedition is exclusively scientific geographical and its object will consist in investigations into these little Known or quite unknown districts from a geographical ethnographic,ethnographical, botanical and archaeologic- point of view. rhe expedition will go from Copenhagen to Aden on board a Danish ship (probably on board a steamer belonging to the Danish East Atlantic line) and on board an English ship from Aden to Muscat, where the operations have to begin. • As the Arabian coast from Aden to Muscat belongs to the sphere of influence of the United Kingdon, the expa-*- dition cannot, do without a permission from the British Go vernment, and also without obtaining protection from the British representatives in the above-mentioned country. In these circumstances, the 'Comite” venture to ask tbe Ministry of Foreign Affairs to obtain the aioresaid assist ance for the expedition.The 'Comite' has the honour to add that the British interests in South Arabia are placed under the care of a representative at Aden and a representative at Muscat, and that the 55th meridian forms the line of demarcation. for the Society, Richelieu, Q.

A si milar communication has been received from the Danish Mi nister at this Court in the note of which a copy is enclosed. I request that you will explain to the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government have al ways been unwilling to undertake to protect their own of ficers and subjects in the regions which the members of the Danish expedition propose to visit, and that they do not in fact allow British travellers to enter those regions^ in these circumstances. His Majesty’s government, to their great regret find themselves unable to accord any facilities to the Danish explorers or offer them any £x&amp;x±±kiss pro tection. d/. H.

I think that the bast plan would be for him to con sult th* Political \gent at Vuscat (la jor i\ F.

The animal in question, the tahr, Isa goat known •Jayakar’ s wild goat'. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Agent at Kuecat in case your fri ond decides to wrj te to him.

I have spent my life shooting big game in all parts of the World and am very anxious to add one of these heads to ray otlier trophies. I am an American by birth, but on the outbreak of the recent Great War, I became a naturalized Englishman in order to take part in it. I joined the 10th Hampshire Regt. ( new Arny) as a 2nd Lieutenant, and fought with it in Gallipoli, where I lost right arm. This loss, however, the gunsmiths have overcome. I am personally quite well known to Sir H. M’Mahon, late Secretary to the Government of India, having met him first when he was political Agent at Gilgit, and I was shooting in those parts, and in the Political Department of the High Commissioner’s in Egypt. Should circumstances favour me, ny intention is to leave England early in October next for Muscat, and commence operations from there.
