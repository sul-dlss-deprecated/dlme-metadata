With reference to your letter of the 17th November Ships in the Persian Gulf, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inform you that they ha~e further considered the question of the method of calculating the charge for pension contribution for Naval ratings and they are now prepared to agree to interest on a Zi basis being taken into consideration and to the substitution of the amount of £4,764 calcula ted by your Department on this basis in lieu of the amount of £8,170 previously included. My Lords desire me to make it clear, however, that this arrangement must be regarded as without prejudice for the period of the War and that they reserve the right to re-open the question in respect of any future claims. jjd-y last, Mo.P.2514, relative to the questions expenses incurred by the Admiralty in respect of additional I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant * Under Secretary of State for India Political Department, India Office, S.W.1.MINUTE. 2 ? $6 '7 7^ Z?/^ Secretary, Political Dept, There would be no advantage, I think, in pursuing any further the question of depreciation.

Memoranda by Mr. TUrner dated 15th Augast and 7th October Telegram sent to India by this Dept. 5th Sept. G-. of I’s reply of 11th Sept. I would suggest that a letter be sent to the Admiralty saying that the Secretary of State in Council does not propose to press any further his objection to the charge on account of depreciation, but that he feels obliged to take exception to the method on which the charges for pension contribution have been calculated inasmuch as no allowance has been made for interest, and a suitable allowance onthis account appears in equity to be required. The letter might point out (1) that the calculations on which the rates of pension contribution charged by the Government of India when officers and men of their service are lent for service under Colonial or Foreign Governments, make allowance for interest at the rate of 4 % and ( 2 ) that in computing the charges for renewals included in the calculationon which the subsidy of £100,000 a year in respect of H.M,Shipsin Indian Waters is based the Admiralty themselves^ allowed credit foi cumulative interest at 3% - letter from Admiralty to 1.0. 15th January 1891, No.2E 97/141^*^ ^ InrTn Admiralty letter of 2 nd December 1909 , 1 /;.01161 it was stated that the estimate of the extra cost of the additional ships for the Arms Traffic Operations was made on the basis ot the subsidised snipslj Mr. Turner’s two memoranda misjht be forwarded &gt; \ t as illustrative of the reduction in the charge to this Office that an allowance for interest would make.

Political Department, India Office, S.W.(3) the most superficial view, therefore, can depreciation charges be regarded as not being in respect of additional expenditure. In all Admiralty calculations of the cost of special services such charges are taken into account. For example, the annual subsidy of £ 100,000 paid by your Department is based on estimates of cost which include depreciation, and it is observed that in Admiralty letuer dated 2nd December, 1909, M.01161, to which Sir R. Ritchie’s letter of 13th April, 1910, was a reply, it was stated that the estimate of the extra cost of the additional ships for the Persian Gulf was made on the basis of the subsidized ships. The extra expense for coal, wear and tear, etc., of the M Hyacinth”, 'Fox”, 'Perseus' and 'Proserpine', or their successors, as a result of the arms traffic operations has not been calculated, as their Lordships are of opinion that the question in no way afiects the claim for depreciation of the 'Philomel', 'Odin' and 'Alert'. Pension Liability. Men .- The charge for pension liability for men has been calculated on the basis adopted for Admiralty purposes generally in calculating ultimate annual pension liability in respect of men serving in the Fleet. The factors from which the annual charges are arrived at are as follows.- (1) Average pension granted for service (at age 40) £20* (2) Percentage of men who are dis charged to pension per annum at age 40 ^ b *(3) Expectation of life at a^e 40 25 years.

It will be observed that the total expenditure for the year amounts to £74,309.2.8, and after allowing for the credit balance of £433.9.4, brought forward from the former account, together with the advance of £64,000 made by the Government of India on the 26th March 1913, a debit balance of £9,875.13.4 remains to be repaid from Indian Funds. With reference to your letter of the 8 th March last, No.P.4706/14, regarding the variation between the sum paid by the Indian Treasury at Bombay in the year 1910, and the amount credited i*n Admiralty claim for the period ended 31st March 1911, I am to observe that the difference in question, viz:- £101.3.3, was in respect of a refund for Naval Stores supplied to Armed Launches, on account of which no charge for Naval Stores was included in the last claim. Consequently no adjustment appears necessary. It would be convenient if an advance of £9,000 could be made to Navy Funds in respect of the debit balance on this account.

To sum up, the vessels in respect of which the subsidy is ordinarily paid consumed about 21,639 tons in the period 1910-11 to 1914-15; while the 'Hyacinth', 'Fox', 'Persetts' and 'Proserpine' (much larger vessels of course) used about 20,474 while acting as subsidised vessels and about 32,391 while employed merely as vessels of the Royal Navy, or 52,865 tons in all, during ’portions of the period 1909-10 to 1914-15, We do not know how much was used by bhe successors of the 'Hyacinth' and the 'Proseroine.' The former ceased to 18606 I. 390. 1000.—3/1916.* ZD to be flagship early in 1911, her place being taken by the ’’Highflyer” and later by the ” Swift sure”. I am afraid it is not safe to draw from the figures any inference as to the &lt; , ’• ' amount of extr a coal consumed by the 'Hyacinth”, 'Persells', 'Fox', 'Proserpine” and their successors, but an inspection of the quarterly Distribution Lists of H.M.S. in Indian Waters supplied to us by the Admiralty (see table attached) shews f that during the period under review they were very frequently employed in the Persian Gulf, at Hus cat, or on the Somali Coast, in all of which stations they would be of assistance in the arms traffic blockade. It seems likely therefore that the Admiralty did pay a considerable additional sum for coal burned by these vessels while engaged in assisting our at ion s. The average charge made by the Government of India for coal) supplied at Admiralty expense was a little &gt;aij on, so that if say 10,000 tons extra were burned by their non-subsidised vessels while engaged in this work the extra cost to them would be about £ 20 , 000 ; ■hv. ! i if 20,000 tons then £40,000. In view of this possibility and of the nrobabilitv t ~ ' ' that the non-subsidised vessels were subjected to additional wear and tear of machinery through continuous cruising (vide paragraph 2 of Admiralty letter of 27th June 1910,) ^ I am still far from confident as to the wisdom of asking the Admiralty to reconsider the 'depreciation” charge; but tt there would be no harm perhaps in including the 'Paragraph 2' drafted in my note of 25th August, with the following If j U alterations, viz - after 'have been' near the beginning omit 'or are likely to be”, and after 'Proserpine” insert 'or their successors”.

FQEEIGN DEPA13TMRNT, pft TO 21st AUGUST 1915 . My telegram of 5th January last and subsequent telegraphic correspondence^Coal supplied by your Government during arms traffic operations. Did you supply any to Hyacinth, Fox, Perseus,Prosorpine referred to in paragraph 2, enclosure 6, my Despatch of 22nd July 1910, 68, and if so, have you raised any claims against naval authorities in virtue of that paragraph ? These four vessels were not as assumed in my telegrams vessels in respect of which annual subsidy is specifically paid, though it has been necessary, during blockade, to regard one or more of them at times for purpose of subsidy as substituted for subsidised vessels.As regards the charge on account of pensions I see no objection to the Admiralty being asked to supply the further details mentioned by the Auditor except that I doubt whether it is worth while.to ask for the copy of the Actuary’s report on which the charges in respect of officers are based. As regards depreciation you will see from my letter to ' r r. Abrahams on P. 350 that the case for resisting these charges is not in my opinion a strong one. I understand from the last paragraph of the Auditor’s note of the oth December that though he takes r different view of the merits he realises the difficulty in the light of the correspondence of 1910 of contesting the claim. I would advise that sanction should now be obtained for accepting it. The Admiralty are, as you know, altogether dissatisfied with the contribution India makes to the Navy and I do not think any good can come from urging them further to abandon a claim, which the corre spondence enti ntitles them to prefer.As regrras the terms on which the subsidised vessels have been used on the blockade, I invite attention to the telegram* below. I think the Admiralty’s notice should be drawn to the groat increa.se in the consumption of coal by the sub sidi sed vessels during the blockade and that they should be informed that it is assumed that in view of the terms of paragraph 2 of their letter of 27th June 1910 &lt; (Enelos. 6 in Lord Morley’s Despatch of 22nd July 1910) — - / / / ' , ^ IvO . —f they will have tw? objection to urge against the raisins; of V a claim in respect of the extra coal supplied to these r/^Wvess^is.

Political, No. 68. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, With reference to paragraph 16 of your Secret Letter No. 135 of 2nd September last, I forward for the information of Your Excellency in Council copy of correspondence 0 that has passed with the Admiralty, regarding the incidence of the Arms traffic: incidence of cost of the naval blockade. * From Admiralty, dated 2nd Decem ber 1909. From ditto, dated 4th December 1909. From ditto, dated 12th March 1910. From ditto, dated 15th March 1910. To ditto, dated 13th April 1910. From ditto, dated 27th June 1910. To ditto, dated 21st July 1910. additional expenditure involved in the maintenance of a naval blockade in the Persian Gulf. 2. After a careful consideration in Council of the Indian case, I satisfied myself that neither under the report of the Welby Commission, nor under the terms of the Rosebery award, could a claim be made on the Imperial exchequer for the entire additional cost with any hope of success, and without the risk of re-opening the wider question of the sufficiency of the existing subsidy, on which, as Your Excellency is aware, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty entertain a very strong opinion. 3. In these circumstances I had no alternative but to accept the rough estimate contained in Admiralty letter of 2nd December 1909, and as a basis for the actual assessment of the charge upon Indian revenues I have further accepted generally the proposals made in Admiralty letter of 27th June. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn. 8733. I. 1325. AENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. Admiralty to India Office. M. 01,161. Admiralty, Sir, 2nd December 1909. I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that they have given careful consideration to your letter of the 15th October last containing copy of an extract from a Despatch from the Government of India on the subject of the arms traffic on the Persian littoral. 2. My Lords recognise the serious political difficulties which may have to be faced if this traffic in arms is not effectively checked, and they are therefore prepared to co-operate with the Indian Government in their efforts to suppress the trade by establishing a naval blockade on the coast. 3. For this purpose they propose to detail two additional ships, viz., His Majesty’s ships “ Odin ” and “ Alert,” for service under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station. These two vessels are at present being refitted, but it is anticipated that they can both be commissioned within the present financial year. 4. In the meantime the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station is taking steps to bring a blockade into being, and by January next the four cruisers “ Fox,” “ Perseus,” “ Proserpine,” and “ Philomel,” are expected to be engaged on this work. 5. The temporary increase of the East Indies Squadron will render it possible to arrange for the periodical relief of one or two ships for repair and recruiting the health of the crews, and will enable the Commander-in-Chief to maintain four ships continuously on blockading duties. Such a blockade should arrest fairly effectively the development of the traffic carried on by the arms-running dhows, but the efficiency of the blockade would be greatly increased if eight steam launches or small steamers or tugs were hired by the Indian Government at Indian ports and attached to the blockading cruisers. Ships’ boats cannot catch a dhow with a fair wind and can only make captures by lying in wait at the dhow’s destination, in which case preconcerted signals from confederates on the shore may warn the dhow of the danger of capture. 6. In addition it would be very desirable to have the co-operation of three Bombay torpedo boats and one Royal Indian Marine ship to act as depot ship for them, provided that these torpedo boats are in a sufficiently good seaworthy condition. If the Secretary of State agrees, it is proposed that the Commander-in-Chief should be instructed to report on this point. 7. I am to state with reference to your letter of the 8th November that it is expected that one of the subsidised ships will be fitted with wireless telegraphy this financial year and the remainder as soon as practicable next financial year. Four of the six vessels which will take part in the proposed blockading operations are already fitted with wireless, andorders have been given to fit the reniaining two. My Lords expect therefore, that the Secretary of State will see his way to proceed with the establishment of the wireless stations at Jask as early as possible, and that the suggestions for the increase of the military guard there and the appointment of a special intelligence officer will be carried out concurrently with the establishment of the naval blockade. 8. My Lords presume that not only must the blockade, in order to be effective, include the Biyaban as well as the Mekran coast, but that when these coasts are effectively blockaded it is not improbable that the arms- running vessels would also attempt to run their cargoes on the coast of Baluchistan to the eastward of Gwatar. It would not be possible without altogether extravagant preparations to extend the already con siderable scope of the naval operations, and My Lords would therefore suggest that the Indian Government should consider the desirability of establishing, concurrently with the enforcement of the naval blockade, a military coast patrol from the Persian frontier as far to the eastward as may be necessary. An organisation somewhat on the lines of the Egyptian Coast Guard would appear to meet the case. 9. As regards expense, the Indian Government should, it is proposed, be directly responsible for the whole cost connected with the torpedo boats and the depot ship and the steam launches. Maxims and three- pounder guns would be provided by the Admiralty. 10. It is impracticable to estimate approximately the total additional cost of the naval operations, but it will be recognised that the proposed action, if continued throughout the whole year (omitting perhaps the period of the south-west monsoons should the state of the traffic admit of it) must entail a very considerable additional charge upon Naval \ otes. It involves particularly the commissioning of two ships, His Majesty’s ships “ Alert ” and “ Odin,” which have been kept in reserve since 1904, and the upkeep of these vessels during their special service in the Persian Gulf. In addition the East Indies Squadron has been comparatively recently reinforced by^fcl.fl.S. “ Philomel,” owing mainly to the demands for the constant presence of His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf. Moreover a considerable expenditure in coal, special fittings for ships working in the Persian Gulf, &amp;c., will have to be incurred before the two extra ships arrive on the station. 11- A rough calculation has, however, been made, on the basis of the subsidised ships, in respect of the three additional ships “ Philomel,” ‘ Odin,” and “Alert,” and it is estimated that, excluding the expense previously referred to, the extra cost for the year would amount to 84,000L My Lords do not admit the contention of the Government of India that this charge should, in accordance with the report of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, be borne by Imperial Funds, as in their opinion it is very largely, if not entirely, a matter concerning the administration of the Government of India, and they propose, accordingly, to make a claim for the repayment of the same from Indian Funds. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Foreign Office. The Under Secretary of State for India. I am, &amp;c., W. Graham Greene..Enclosure No. 2. Admiralty to India Office. M. 01,161. Admiralty, Sii’, 4th December 1909. In continuation of Admiralty letter M. 0 i ,161 of the 2nd December, relative to the measures for suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you that they are informed by the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, that the three torpedo boats referred to in paragraph 6 of the above-mentioned letter have been sold by the Indian Government. The proposal for the employment of these vessels should therefore be cancelled, but it is probable that a Poyal Indian Marine ship will be very useful in connection with the blockade, and it is assumed that the Indian Government will lend her services if required. The Commander-in-Chief has requested that immediate s.teps may be taken to hire eight steam launches, as proposed in paragraph 5 of Admiralty letter of the 2nd instant, as it appears that caravans will probably be collected earlier this year than formerly, and the busiest part of the season will now commence. Their Lordships suggest therefore that authority should be tele graphed to the Indian Government accordingly. I am, &amp;c., Geo. H. Hoste, The Under Secretary of State pro Secretary, for India.

I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State C. I. Thomas. for India.Enclosure No. 5. India Office to Admiralty. No. 3075. India Office, Sir, 13th April 1910. With reference to your letters (No. M.) of the 12th and 15th March, I am directed to say that, in accordance with the arrangement already made orally, the Secretary of State for India consents to the withdrawal of H.M.S. “ Alert ” and “ Perseus ” from the blockade in the Persian Gulf, on the understanding that no charge falls upon Indian revenues on their account during the period of their withdrawal. With reference to your letter of the 2nd December last, M. 01,161, I am directed to say that in the circumstances the Secretary of State in Council is prepared to bear the extra expenditure involved in the blockade. He observes that, apart from the cost of preparing additional ships for service in the Persian Gulf, the extra expenditure, if these vessels were continuous^ employed, is estimated at 84,000i. a year; but he will, of course, require detailed information before making- pay ment, in order to be satisfied that the claims on this Office are strictly limited to expenditure that would not have been incurred if the blockade had not been undertaken. The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are aware that the blockade has been sanctioned until the end of April only, and that the position will be reviewed before that date. I have, &amp;c., R. Ritchie. The Secretary, Admiralty. Enclosure No. 6. Admiralty to India Office. M. 4322. Admiralty, SR, ^ 27th June 1910. With reference to your letter of 13th April last I am com manded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you that they note that the Secretary of State for India in Council is prepared to bear the extra expenditure involved in the blockade in the Persian Gulf, and that they consider that this expenditure should be estimated on the following basis :— (a) The Government of India to bear the cost of running and maintaining the three ships “ Philomel,” “ Odin,” and “ Alert,” including full pay, wages, and liability for non- effective charges of ships’ complements; also depreciation of hulls, machinery, boilers, and armaments. As stated in Admiralty letter M. 01,161, of 2nd December, the “Philomel” was added to the station owing mainly to the demands for the constant presence of His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf, and it was necessary to replace her on the Mediterranean Station by commissioning another ship, the Medea.” It is considered that in her case the cost should be reckoned from the 3rd November 1909, the date of her arrival in the Persian Gulf. The “ Odin ” and “ Alert ” were specially commissioned for the blockade, and their cost should be reckoned from the dates of commissioning at Cape Town and Bermuda respectively, viz., “Odin,” 11th January 1910; “Alert,” 15th February 1910; excluding, in the case of the “ Alert ” the cost incurred during the period 29th March to 25th Maywhen the vessel was detached on service between Aden and Berbera. In the case of “ Odin ” and “ Alert ” all charges for special fittings for ships working in the Persian Gulf also to be borne by the Government of India. (b) The Government of India to bear the whole cost of the hire, running and manning of eight steam launches, the Royal Indian Marine depot ship, and “ Whimbrel.” The charge under this head would include passage expenses (out and home) and expense of full pay, wnges, and allowances (but not non-effective charges) in respect of naval officers sent out from England for the eight launches, crews sent out for four launches, and signal ratings sent out for the depot ship and “Hardinge.” No charge would be made in respect of full pay, wages, &amp;c., of those naval ranks and ratings who were not specially sent out for the purpose of manning the launches, inasmuch as no extra expense would be entaded if such ratings be drawn from ships on the station. (c) The Government of India to bear the whole cost in respect of the “ Hardinge.” 2. The blockade will probably be found to have involved considerable extra cost in respect of coal consumed by the other ships of the squadron (“ Hyacinth,” “ Fox,” “ Perseus,” and “ Proserpine,”) and additional wear and tear to their machinery caused by continuous cruising. Their Lordships are prepared, however, to accept this cost as a charge to Naval Votes, provided that the proposals at (a), (6), and (c) are also, accepted. 3. I am to request the concurrence of the Secretary of State in the above proposals in order that a claim may be made out accordingly for the whole period over which the blockade has extended. It is noted in this connection that, although formally sanctioned till the 30th April, the blockade has remained in operation till now, and the Government of India in their telegram of 7th June recommend its continuance until December next. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State C. I. Thomas. for India. Enclosure No. 7. India Office to Admiralty.

In reply, I am to say that Viscount Morley accepts generally the proposals of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty as to the basis on which the share of the expenditure chargeable to Indian revenues should be calculated for the whole period over which the blockade has been actually in force on the scale described in your letter.

When clear of the harbour’s mouth, Lieutenant B. Gordon, R.I.M., in the*steam cutter, was sent alongside and after removing the crew took her in tow to northward to await ship, which having steam up arrived on the scene shortly afterwards; the crew were brought on board “ Pox ” for custody and examination, the dhow was searched (she was nearly empty) and then taken in tow for Jask, where, on arrival about 4 p.m., 6th May, the I A Nakhoda and two crew were landed and detained (not imprisoned). | 3. Every member of the dhow’s crew was permitted to remove his per sonal belongings under the direct supervision of Lieutenant B. Gordon, R.I.M. 4.

From—- ff Sphinx,” To—The Senior Naval Officer. I searched a dhow one mile south-east of Das Dashidi at 8-30 a.m. this morning, 17th. Nakhoda stated he landed donkeys and passengers at Puzim several days ago. She left there last night bound for Maskat. Nakhoda and crew are all Baluchis. Saw nothing suspicious.

From—“ Sphinx,” To—The Senior Naval Officer. Submit reply to your 2135 and 2150. Dhow is a small (?) badan with a very long yard and a small sail on it, her longer sail being made up in a bundle and stowed aft. She had two large water casks aft and a very large rudder. Crew consisted of seven Baluchis, Nakhoda being a specially big man with dark beard. They can all be recognised by “ Sphinx’s ” boarding officer but no names were taken. Cargo about 20 logs of wood, 12 feet long and 6 inches in diameter. She had a blue and white striped staff aft but no halyards on it. Yellow mark resembling an eye on bow. Mast is very tall and strongly stayed. Dhow left Maskat ten days ago. Dhow and crew belonged to Sib.

CAULFEILD, Senior Naval Officer.CONFIDENTIAL. Commander-in-Chief’s Office, Diyatalawa; 23rd May 1914 No. 102—1462. Sir, In reply to Government of India telegram* No. 1917—12 M., of the * Semi No. 286, Part xv. relative to the possibi lity of discontinuing the arms traffic blockade in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council, that in my opinion the time has now arrived when the number of vessels employed on the blockade may he sensibly reduced. 2. A report, dated 6th May 1914 from the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, on the subject is forwarded herewith, and I concur generally in his views. 3. I am not in favour of the complete withdrawal of the blockade at the present juncture as it appears to me more than probable that a recrudescence of the arms traffic in some form or other would ensue as soon as the absence of the patrolling vessels became generally known. In this event the re-establish ment of the blockade would prove more expensive and inconvenient in the long run than its gradual reduction. 4. What I would therefore propose now is— (a) to reduce the blockade to the following dimensions two men-of-war to be continuously on duty, and two armed launches, viz., “ Harold ” and “ Mashona ” (the two largest and most service able craft now employed). The remaining two, viz., “ Karanja ” and “Miner”, to he paid off. (b) that the situation be carefully watched by these vessels aided by the Intelligence Officer and staff of Police officials at present engaged in this service, and that a further review of affairs be taken in three months’ time with the object of deciding whether the total discontinuance of the blockade would then he justifiable. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, -* &amp;. H. JlEIRSE, Hear-A dmii'al, i Naval Comniander-in-Chief. H. M. S. “ Fox ” at Maskat, No. 47. 6th May 1914. Sir, In compliance with your order No. 1162 of 18th April 1914, I have the honour to report as follows regarding the possibility of discontinuing the blockade.1 . Prom 2 nd September 1913 (date of my arrival in Persian Gulf waters) until 20 th January 1914, it was not possible owing to the delicacy 0 f the Maskat situation and to the paucity of ships available to maintain a really effective blockade. (As a result 1,124 rifles were reported to have beea landed during this period.) 2. From 21st January to 6th April 1914, with the exception of a few days in March, an effective blockade was maintained and a marked reduction in gun-running resulted (67 rifles having been reported as landed). 3 . On 6 th April 1914 the blockade of the Mekran coast was raised owing to the assembly of the East Indies Fleet under the Commander-in-Chief at Maskat. 4 . It was felt that the total cessation of the blockade which must very soon become known to all arms-runners, would be the signal for renewed activity on their part, hut to give the point full play the Mekran coast was purposely left unwatched even after the departure of the Commander-in-Chief, and it has remained unwatched up to the present moment, i.e., from 7th April to 6 th May 1914. 5 . The results, hardly anticipated, are as follows:— IVith both coast lines (Oman and Mekran), and the sea absolutely unguarded, the total number of rifles reported to have been landed (see attached sheet on the Persian coast during this period (7th April to 6 th May) amount to a total of only 54 rifles. It may be contended that this somewhat remarkable inactivity on the part of the gun-runners is due to the fact that no arms caravans leave the Mekran coast for the interior after April, but the value of such contention is discounted by the common knowledge that the one and great object cf the arms-runner is to get his cargo safely over to the Persian cc as , si me, once there, the rifles can be, and are, buried or hidden (occasionally for months) until such time as they can be conveniently collected and carried overland to their final destination. 6 . I am consequently of opinion, and this opinion is amply borne ont by the latest reports (Nos. 45 of oth March 1914 and 96 of 13th April 1914) of Mr. Misick, Superintendent of Police at Karachi, that the surj)lus stocks of arms and ammunition in Oman territory are now negligible. 7. In my telegram No. 10 to Commander-in-Chief, of 8 th February 1914, I maintained with reference to these stocks that until some reliable proof of their negligibility could be obtained, the continuance ot the blockade on its present basis was desirable, 8 . The foregoing facts supply, I submit, the required proof , r and it is therefore considered that the blockade, in its present form, may now, tv it reasonable safety, be reduced. 9. Thanks to the stringent measures taken against arms merchants, the searching and detention of dhows on suspicion, and the deportationo persons implicated, especially that (in December 1913) of Ali Khan, notorious Maskat arms merchant, Ma&amp;kat and the Batinah coast towns ave now become, comparatively speaking, negligible factors in the arms ra situation, yet so long as large profits can he made without undue risks, so 0 D 3 will there be attempts at carrying on this traffic in one form or ano eri Persian Gulf waters. 10. At present there are the strongest grounds for believing tha a ^ md ammunition (hidden in beer casks, &amp;c.) are smuggled into toe ^ Jerraan steamers of the Hamburg-Amerika line—the method usually a op Deing to stop in the vicinity of Larak Island off Kishm, and to trans er ‘ iountraband into dhows, which then land their cargo as convenient a 180 spots on the Oman or Persian coasts. As the place of the transfer can ^ iltered by arrangement to any place in the Persian Gulf, it will pm bund necessary to more or less shadow the steamer, and the politica ability of such a step must be first considered. 11. There is little doubt that if this form of smuggling were to serious proportions, the fact would very soon become known througf/rTfi t L a r d • i fif 0r * PrS \ but !l ? any case two men-of-war able to ieep the sea with the ei^tion WeleSS telegraphy WOuld bcrer l uired to deal adequately Statement of numbers of rifles reported to have been landed on Persian Coast Inclusive dates.

From— Majob S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ; To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram* No. 358 S., • serial No. is. dated 9th June 1914, in which you were so good as to favour me with the approval of Government to the instructions given by me to the Political Agent, Maskat, in the matter of the excess ammunition ordered by Hajji Najaf, Agent of Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us-Subah, at Maskat. In his reply to those instructions, the Political Agent reports that Hajji Najaf states that the excess cartridges number 379,440 rounds and that no more have been ordered. Hajji Najaf has admitted to the Political Agent that he was warned by me at Maskat that Government sanction was limited to the 6,000 rifles and 400 rounds per rifle. In my letterf No. 1734, dated 7th June 1914, to your address, I had the t Serial No. 19 . honour to explain the nature of the Arabic error that might be held to justify the Shaikh’s assumption that the sanction of Government was not limited to 24 lakhs of rounds. Put it is possible that you, sir, may recollect sufficient of the matter in question which appears to have been discussed verbally between yourself as Resident, the Shaikh of Kuwait and Captain Shakespear, the then Political Agent, to be able to declare authoritatively that there could have been no misunderstanding as to the quantity of the ammunition the Shaikh was permitted to import. In that case, ^ I may perhaps be authorised to reply to the Shaikh that the sanction to import the extra six lakhs of ammunition was due to the error of an Arab Munshi and that it is difficult to see how the Shaikh could have been misled by it, when the question was fully discussed between yourself and him verbally and when Hajji Najaf, his Agent, has admitted that the Political Agent, Maskat, myself, had given him full and explicit verbal instructions that only 24 lakhs of rounds were covered by the Government permit. Still that, as a mistake has been made, and in order that the Shaikh may not be put to loss, we are urging His Highness the Sultan of Maskat to grant facilities for the amount of excess ammunition actually lying in the State Warehouse but only on the clear understanding that no further indents can be considered in the near future. The other course, which Government may perhaps prefer, is to say nothing about the mistake but to remind the Shaikh of Kuwait that Kesidency letter No. 221, dated 15th October 1912, only permits the import of 30 lakhs of ammunition in all, of which only 220,560 rounds remain to be imported, after the present 379,440 rounds have been despatched, that future imports must be limited strictly to that amount and that no further indents can be considered in the near future. I have the honour to request that I may be fovoured with instructions on the point, if possible by telegraph, as the Shaikh may make a grievance of warehouse dues and demurrage charges which are mounting up.27 No. 141, dated the 15th (received 24th) June 1914 (Confidential).

Senior H. M. S. “ Eox ” at Sea, No. 1—14. SlE, (Off Makran Coast) 8th January 1914. I have the honour to report the following incident in connection with the Arms Traffic Blockade. During the evening of January 6th, shortly after “Pox’s” arrival at Maskat, I received an urgent message from the Commanding Officer H. M. S. “ Sphinx (position 6 miles off Dill on Batinah Coast), to the effect that he was detaining a dhow carrying 18 armed men and a few passengers, that the said dhow had no “ pass ” and that he requested instructions. By my orders, “ Sphinx,” with dhow in tow, at once proceeded to Maskat, carried out a thorough search of dhow’s cargo (it proved to be quite innocent in character) well outside the harbour, and anchored close to Consulate du'ing the afternoon of 'Wednesday, January 7th. The Political Agent, with whom I had previously conferred on the matter, interviewed His Highness j^he Sultan the same morning (January 7th) before “ Sphinx’s ” arrival, and learned that these 18 armed men were travelling with the Sultan’s knowledge, and, indirectly, with his permission. Thereupon with the concurrence of the Political .Agent, I caused the 18 rifles and ammunition to be deposited in the British Consulate for safe custody, and, at the same time, I discharged the 18 owners with directions to report themselves to the Sultan, and ordered the dhow’s Nakhoda to remain at anchor until he had received a ‘’pass” signed in the usual way by His Highness the Sultan. In order to obviate further detention of the ship at Maskat, arrangements were made before sailing, that the Political Agent should return the arms to their owners on production by letter of a signed permit from Sultan. I would submit, in conclusion, that the apprehension of these men, the temporary confiscation of their arms and ammunition, as also of the dhow it self, will have a salutary effect on all concerned—not least on His Highness the Sultan himself—and will cause it to be clearly understood that the Kegulations regarding the carrying of a “ pass ” by any dhow with arms or ammunition cannot be lightly disregarded.

It is not easy to estimate stock of ammunition and arms outside Maskat warehouse ; before his deportation Ali Khan stated that he had little ammunition and 800 rifles : a great amount of this must now be exhausted, if we can rely upon the reports from Mekran. “ It does not seem possible that this trade should ever regain its former formidable proportions unless it takes an entirely new departure. I under stood that object of continuance of naval blockade was to prevent such a contingency. ‘ ‘ Leakage of arms and ammunition will continue for some time, especially if the French and Laubenburg stocks go to local buyers approved by us. “ TJntrustworthyness of local troops and also Sultan’s purchases which will be probably extensive especially if he persists in policy he announces of endeavour ing to subdue his rebellious subjects by force of arms will certainly enable moderate gunrunning to continue but not such as to justify expensive blockade nor such as Navy can hope to control effectively. “ Line to be taken in my opinion to curb this is gradually to define strict annual requirements of Maskat and limit imports thereto. “ I therefore consider local stocks now negligible and I adhere to views expressed in my telegram 221, December 26th.” A ^€&amp; AAf€ ' ( '■ ’ Telegram P., No. 56, dated the 26th December 1913.

As this may be due in part to a lesser number of war ships than usual having been available, I should still deprecate any reduction being made in the present blockade operations, until we are assured that the stocks of ammunition and arms outside the ware house at Maskat are exhausted and that the warehouse is working satisfac torily.

On the assumption that the arms at Maskat become the property of Government on payment of compensation to the Drench dealers in arms, I would recommend their early removal from the warehouse to Bombay or some other convenient port in India where they could be placed in charge of the military authorities. I consider this course desirable in order to prevent pro bable and possible leakage from the Maskat warehouse. A number of arms are of service bore and those that are serviceable might be utilised for issue to levies or native troops. This is, however, a point on which the military authori ties could best advise. As regards the stock at Jibuti, I understand from Doreign Office letter to India Office, dated 12th November 1913, that no com pensation is likely to be paid and am under the impression that any arms that were re-shipped to that port left Maskat before the inventory was prepared and consequently shall belong to the dealer.

With reference to Marine Department letter* of 12th instant, No. 589— * Serial No. 140. M., requesting my views on the situ- . . , ation as it now stands in respect of the arms traffic operations in the Persian Gulf, be pleased to submit the following remarks to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council. 2. The arms traffic remains much the same as reported in my letter,! f Serial No. 55. No. 1462-XIV—K.-13, of 12th May last. No lar ge cargoes of arms are being run, but many dhows crossing the Gulf carry a few on the chance of getting them through, jettisoning them on meeting with one of the blockading vessels. 3. Latterly the Government of India has approved applications, which I have put forward, to burn dhows of which the Nakhodas have been proved to have run cargoes of arms on previous voyages, and such action will, if con tinued, have a great moral effect and tend to check the insidious form the traffic has assumed. 4. It is not considered that it will be possible for some time to reduce the force now employed in the Gulf. Major Craufurd, in his Arms Traffic Diary, 1st to 12th July (Secret No. 65), states that the arms dealers are remov ing arms from Maskat to the Batinah Coast. Major Craufurd has previously reported {vide my letter quoted above) that a depot of 6,000 arms has been established at the Sohar, and other depots are known to exist on the Trucial and Hater Coasts. Until the stock at these depots is exhausted, it will not be possible to relax our vigilance, as we may expect that, owing to the rise which will take place in the prices of arms as soon as the restrictive measures at Maskat come into force, great efforts will be made to get rid of the arms wherever it is iound the coast is not being watched. 5. As soon as the bonded warehouse arrangement at Maskat comes into force (on 1st September) it should be possible to prevent any export from Sohar by sea, as it is presumed that there will be no objection, in view of the Sultan’s proclamation in Maskat, to the Batinah Coast being closely watched and dhows searched in Maskat waters, in which case the Mekran and the Biyaban Coast south of Musandam can be cut off. Arms will, however, still be able to go by land to the Trucial Coast, and the whole of the Persian coast inside the Gulf will require watching. This will not admit of any reduction in the strength of the blockading squadron, and it may be necessary to press for the four additional launches to be commissioned as proposed in my letter of 12th May. 6. The only alternative to this would appear to be to buy up the arms in all the depots. Possibly there may be objections to such a course, but if the bonded warehouse at Maskat can be depended upon to prevent the illicit export of arms from that place, it would undoubtedly be the cheapest method of putting a stop to the trade.140 No. 589—46 M., dated (and received) Simla, the 12th Jnly 1912 (Secret).

S. “ Highflyer ” at Colombo, the 12th May 1912. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, To— The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. Be pleased to lay before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General of India in Council the following report on the state of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf The first effect of the measures taken by my predecessor in the autumn of 1909 was undoubtedly to deal a heavy blow to the arms dealers in Maskat, and practically to ruin their trade with the Afghans on the Mekran Coast. This is evidenced by the decreased importation of arms into Maskat after the Naval blockade made itself felt. But latterly the trade has revived, and, thouo-h only carried on in a modified form with the Mekran Coast, it is spreading in a manner very difficult to deal with in the Persian Gulf itself. The number of arms being imported into Maskat is increasing, which points to the fact that the arms dealers are recovering the position they held before the naval measures were taken. The method of procedure is as follows Arms are shipped from Maskat to Sohar. This being in the Sultan of Maskat’s territory cannot at present be interfered with. Prom there, they are carried by camel to the Trucial Coast and across the Gulf to the Persian Coa,st from the vicinity of Behai Aiman or Shargah, also by camel to Abu Thabi, whence they go by dhow to the Katar Coast and Bahrain and across to the Shibkuh, Dashti or Tangistan Coasts. It is stated 'by Maior Craufurd in his diary of 8th to 25th April that a den6t has been formed at Sohar, and that about 6,000 rifles are collected there. Opportunity, no doubt, is taken of any relaxation in the blockade on the Mekran Coast to run rifles there from Sohar. Another large depot is reported as existing at Dohar on the Katar Peninsula. The blockading force has, therefore, to watch the coast line practically from Gwatr Bay tolhe Shatt-el-Arab, a distance of over 700 miles. This is beyond the power of the present force.2. I am of opinion that a purely blockading force will never do more than make it rather more expensive to land arms in Persia, and, since it pays the dealers if they can run one cargo in three successfully, there is little chance of their giving up the traffic as long as arms are imported into Maskat. Whether the establishment of a bonded warehouse will have the effect of pre venting the arms dealers in Maskat from exporting arms and ammunition into prohibited areas remains to be seen, but it is within the bounds of probability that the Prench, who have been very tenacious of their rights to trade in arms at Maskat, will refuse to sit down and see those rights destroyed by a control of export, which, if it is to answer our purpose, must practically amount to a prohibition. However, in the absence of powers to obtain a prohibition of the import of arms and ammunition into Maskat it is worth while to try the alternative of the bonded warehouse, if the Sultan can be induced to agree to place it on a thoroughly satisfactory basis, which should include— {a) Placing the warehouse, if possible, in the charge of an official of the Indian Government, or, if not, of some one acceptable to the Indian Government. (5) No passes to be issued for export to any port on the Mekran or Biyaban Coasts or in the Persian Gulf without the sanction of the Political Resident. (c) No passes to be issued for export to any port or town in Oman bt-yond the number of rifles and quantity of ammunition agreed upon with the Sultan as necessary for the defence of his territory (d) A warehouse to be established at Sohar, or else the arms there to be brought back and warehoused at Maskat or bought by the Indian Government. If the above conditions can be obtained, and a trustworthy person can be found to be placed in charge of the warehouse, it will probably effect our object and in time practically stop the import of arms and ammunition into Maskat. An increasing number of arms and ammunition are being imported into Maskat and are finding their way to depots at Sohar and other places on the Trucial and Katar Coasts, whence the majority probably find their way across the Gulf. It is, therefore, desirable that the details of the scheme should be arranged with the Sultan of Maskat as soon as possible, and that it should be brought into force by the end of the summer, if possible. 8. I have arranged during the summer months for four ships besides the four armed launches and the “ Minto ” to be on duty in the Persian Gulf. In view of the number of arms stored at Sohar and the reputed activity of Islam Khan it will be necessary to maintain one ship and two launches on the Mekran Coast, which only leaves three ships and two launches to watch the whole of the Persian Coast. It is hoped, however, by a redistribution of the vessels and by moving them about continuously so that the gun-runners may not know where they may run against them that systematic attempts to smuggle arms across the Gulf during the hot weather may be frustrated. 4. It will not be possible, however, to keep an efficient check on this traffic with the present force after the monsoon is over, and until the effects of the new sysiem have begun to show themselves, it is proposed that four more launches be added, and that they should be commissioned on 1st October. 5. It is very desirable that the wireless stations sanctioned for the Gulf ports should be established with as little delay as possible.^ % f r.i tjt * From Viceroy, 9th February 1912. Foreign Secret.

As I am shortly to give up the Command of the East Indies Station I have the honour to request that you will be pleased to lay before His Excel lency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council the following observations upon the general situation in the Persian Gulf. ° 2 . The main object with which the operations in the Persian Gulf were undertaken, namely, the suppression of the Arms Traffic into the Mekran and Persian Baluchistan, may be said to have been attained, and during the present season only a few rifles have been smuggled in from time to time Afghans, in organised bodies, no longer remain in the district, and the local Khans have all agreed to accept our terms and to prevent the trade from again assuming formidable proportions. 3. Arms and ammunition in considerable numbers are still exported from Maskat, but they now go almost entirely into Southern Persia via the Trucial Coast, Katar or Kuwait. It appears that most of the imports are absorbed in Persia itself, and probably tend very largely to keep up the condi tion of unrest which obtains there. At every place in Southern Persia which I have visited recently, the men have been generally armed with the most modern rifles obtainable and instances have been reported to me of men having been seen with automatic rifles of the very latest pattern. The tvpe of rifles captured also bears this out, for the numbers of modern' small bore rifles is now largely in excess of the older pattern Martinis and Schneiders. I feel confident that the constant raiding and fighting which is goTng~ on In Southern Persia is largely due to the fact that the tribesmen are so welf armed. 4. The principal points from which supplies reach the coast of Persia are the following:— ( 1 ) The Trucial coast and the Katar Peninsula, which supply the Shibkuh coast including the Island of Kishm. ( 2 ) The Katar Peninsula and Kuwait, which supply the Tangistan coast from Bas-el-Mustaf to the Khor Musa. 5. The arms and ammunition apparently reach the Trucial coast by inland routes from Sohar. Since the capture by the Shaikh of Debai, however, in August 1911, they do not appear to be brought near the Trucial Ports, but are bidden in the desert at the back of the coast and are shipped from places which are not frequented by other people. Those which are intended for Laristan and the districts round are taken straight across as opportunity offers. Those that are destined for the coast further north are sent along the Trucial coast by sea; the dhows which carry them keep as much as possible within the shoals until opposite the point at which they wish to land, and then go across. Careful watch is kept to see that men-of-war are not about, and if one of His Majesty’s Ships is sighted the whole consignment is very often jettisoned. Sometimes the arms runners trust to hiding the rifles, and the greatest ingenuity is displayed in stowing them away, but since the systematic search ing of all dhows has been undertaken it is becoming rarer to find any arms or ammunition hidden. Those engaged in the traffic even go to the trouble of having dhows cruising to watch and report the movements of ships and boats on the blockade. 6 . Arms for the Tangistan coast nearly all go overland to the Trucial oast, preferably to Abu Thabi or somewhere in that neighbourhood, and thence coast inside the shoals to the Katar Peninsula or to Kuwait. Some still go to Kuwait in the large dhows, well hidden, trusting to the difficulty of an efficient search being made to carry them through. It is said that since the last dhow was burnt this method has not been so much in favour as it was, and trust is rather placed in the slower and safer method of sending the consignments overland, and then along the coast out of reach of our boats, even though this is more expensive.7. The arrangement with the Sultan of Mash at to establish a bonded warehouse is not yet in working order, but the result of the agreement has been to put a great impetus on the export of arms to Sohar, whence they are distributed. It will probably be necessary to establish a branch warehouse there if the scheme is to be practically effective. 8 . The position of the Tracial coast will be one of great importance to the Arms Traffic when Maskat is closed, as we hope will soon be the case. Although the Trucial Chiefs have all made treaties with us to prohibit the Arms Traffic, these treaties are practically dead letters, because it is thought that we cannot enforce them. This being so, and the Trucial Chiefs* territories being the most convenient places in which to establish distributing centres, we may expect to see the trade from that locality very much more carefully organised in the near future. As far as the position of affairs stands at present, the only question that will be very much affected by this will be that of Southern Persia, as if a regular supply can be counted on, there will be small chance of any real improvement in the condition of the country. Por the moment I do not think very many of these arms and ammunition go to the North-West Frontier of India or to Afghanistan, but this is a state of affairs which cannot he expected to last, and if it is found that we cannot stop this trade through Laristan then the Afghan market will again be opened. 9. It is possible to stop arms and ammunition from going into Southern Persia by a close blockade of the coast, and such a watch is now in force from Kishm to Ras-el-Mustaf. This blockade, I intend, shall be maintained strictly until about the end of April, and it will be then shifted to do the same on the Tangistan coast for six weeks or so. In this way I hope to drive all the arms for shipment to Katar, and then when the arms runners think they are clear and can get over to the Persian Coast, suddenly the blockade will be shifted, and then we may expect that any arms that are at sea will be captured. 10. This will probably be effective, but it precludes any possibility of reducing the cost of operations in the Gulf in the immediate future. It is therefore a matter for consideration whether the time has now arrived when it will be less expensive to take steps with a view to bringing the Trucial coast, under more effective control, and so to remove another possible focus from which arms can be distributed. This will greatly reduce the area to be watched and will most probably enable the expenses to be cut down. No. 800—4) M., dated Calcutta, the 28th March (received 1st April) 1912.

Sir: - I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to transmit herewith for the observation of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty a copy of a letter from the Foreign Off-ice dated the 14th ultimo, the enclosures to which have. They understand, been already communicated to your Department, recommending that one half of the cost of the extension of the naval blockade against the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf should be borne by Imperial Funds. In Their Lordships* opinion this liability, % which is at present quite undefined, should, if accepted, fall upon Navy Votes, but although half the cost of the military force in Persia has been accepted as a charge on the British Exchequer it does not necessarily follow that India should be similarly relieved in respect of the expenditure involved in extending the blockade. Not only does it seem im possible definitely to earmark the expenditure involved to ^6 Secretary, Admiralty.to the defence of British interests in Persia rather than to the protection of the Indian frontier hut the proposal has to be considered with reference to the inadequacy of the Naval subsidy paid by the 'l Um Italian Government. The reconsideration of the amount of the Indian contribution has been postponed pending the conclu sion of the blockade of the Persian Gulf (Sir C.I. Thomas* letter of 24th January 1911, No. M/E 6739), and this being so My Lords cannot consider it reason able that a claim should at the same time be preferred against Imperial Funds in respect of the cost of the blockade itself.

A iMiediate and Confidential Sir I have laid before my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty your letter of the 5th instant, No.P. 474 , relative to the continuance and extension of the Arms Traffic Blockade, and I am commanded by them to offer in reply the following 1 observations for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India in Council. P.- My Lords feel that they cannot at the present time demur to the continuance of the Arms Traffic Blockade on the Mekran and. Biyaban Coasts, for the extra cost of which the Government of India are paying; but they wish to state that they regard with some apprehension an indefinite continuance of the blockade, having regard to the many calls which are also made upon the limited number of H.M.Ships that are available for such services by the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office. 3.- To the proposed extension of the blockade, so far as it can be effected with the ships of the East Indies Squadron, they equally feel that they can offer no objection so long as the situation in Southern Persia remains threat ening, and the withdrawal of the 'Proserpine” Mom’ the_ Somali Coast for this purpose at the end of January appea.fe^ to them reasonable. In the present state of affairs, however, in Crete apd .. j China they are unable to reinforce the East Indies Squadron, ' and Phe Under Secretary of State, India Office. COPY TO INDIA 15 191V. SEC RE i AKY’H NR...?,!, UP.—No,\ and owing to the activity of the Mullah the Secretary of fo, -he Colonies is strongly pressing for the return of a ship to the SoBiali Coast. H.M.S.'Dido', which is engaged on trooping service, and was passing Aden homeward bound, has been diverted to the Somali Coast for a few days, but she will resume her passage homeward not later than the 17-,! insuant. If consequently a ship of the Squadron is withdrawn from the Persian Gulf for the Somali Coast, the extension of the blockade to the Coast of Fars and Laristan becomes impossible. 4.- Lord Crewe will recognise that it is a matter of extreme difficulty for My Lords to discriminate between the demands o^ L he India, Foreign and Colonial Offices. If, however, .die three Departments can come to an agreement in tne matter I/!y£*vjs' r il 1 be happy to order the disposition of ships on the Fast Indies Station in whatever way their services may be considered to be most urgently required.

V y A dmiralty, February 7.912 . Sir Adverting to your letter of the 13th April 1910 and to subsequent correspondence relative to the extra expenditure involved by the blockade in the Persian Gulf, I am com manded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inform you txiat they nave had under consideration the effect on Naval funds of the repayments by India in respect of this expenditure. It will be witnin the recollection of tne Secretary of State for India in Council that in April last a sum of £88,700 was received from Indian Funds on account of tne total estimated expenditure from the commencement of the special arrangements connected with this service to the 31st March 1911,viz.,£108,500. It ?/as noped that a detailed Statement showing the actual sum incurred.!or that period might have been pre pared by tnis date, but it is found impossible to collect the necessary information for some little time yet. As it is very desirable that the full sum estimated to be received from India in 1911-12 should as far as practic able be realised, I am to suggest that a further advance to the extent of £19,800 may now be paid subject to adjust ment when the final claim is completed. My Lords anticipate that it will be ultimately found that the total expenditure to the 31st March 1911 will exceed £108,500. A Receivable Order is enclosed to enable the amount to be paid into the Bank of England. - S l he Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.

It is of course essential to Admiralty finance that no portion of this latter sum of £64,000 should be received by this Department before the 1 st April next.

Affairs in Persia. The nnruliness of the tribes in Ears and Laristan is to be greatly accounted for by the facility with which arms and ammunition can be obtained from the Trucial Coast, and A1 Bida and Kuwait. It is known that large quantities are going to these places from Maskat, partly by land and partly by sea. The tribes are at present mostly armed with small bore modern rifles the ammunition for which cannot be refilled. The older rifles, the cartridge cases of which could be filled with black powder many times, are mostly sold to tribes further north and east. The only routes by which the ammunition can be obtained are— 1. Through Eussia. 2. Through Turkey via Baghdad. 3. Across the Gulf. The first and second are not practicable at present for large supplies, and if we stop the third, the movement amongst the tribes must come to an end soon for want of ammunition. At a conference on 20th January at which the general policy to be pursued J was discussed, it was decided that the blockade should be made as stringent as 1 possible. At the request of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India I have ordered the “ Proserpine *’ to proceed immediately to the Persian Gulf. I would further submit that this squadron may be temporarily increased by one additional ship so as to allow the long length of coast from Kishm to the Shatt-el-Arab (hUOmiles) to be efficiently watched. Addressed to the Admiralty; repeated to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.—■ Mf* • 't : r; There remains the question of bloclvadiug the coast in order to prevent the import of arms and ammunition. Sir E. Grey will doubtless agree with the Government of India and the Naval Commander-in-Chief that this is a measure which must sooner or later be undertaken. But it is to be feared that if it is put in force now the stoppage of supplies may cause the same irritation among the tribesmen there as it did among the Afghans on the Mekran coast and the tribes on the North-West Frontier of India, and may therefore seriously endanger the safety of Shiraz. It is a question, therefore, whether it should not be postponed unless a su fficient force to effect relief, if necessary, is within reach. : Gw *• v W . . .
