The gold sovereigns disbursed by Mr. Grafftey- Smith were supplied through the Bank of England at approximately £2 per sovereign; the rials were probably obtained from the sale of bills of exchange to Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company. The total cost is likely to be about £200 or a little less. 3. As this expenditure was incurred by reason of the Viceroy s visit.

[E 4519/17/25] With the Compliments of the Under Secretary ef State for Foreign Affairs .vai i June 26, 1945. Section 1. Mr. Grafftey-Smi (No. 104.) Sir, WITH reference to your telegram No. 274 of correspondence relating to tl^ Vmeid Mg -r. JiU J Copy No. 1 32 h tdjMr, E/ltW — {l\eceived 2§th June.) L3 * D Jedda, 9th June, 1945. the 1st June and relative isit to Tbn Saud, I have the honour to inform you that his Excellency, accompaiTlkd 'by Sir Evan Jenkins, private secretary, and Captain Henderson, aide-de-camp, arrived in Jedda by air from Cairo on the 3rd June. Conflicting reports from Egypt had left us in some doubt atf to the expected time of arrival of the Royal Air Force Lodestar in which the Viceroy travelled. In the event, the party arrived rather in advance of the earlier of the times indicated; but, fortunately, the Emir Mansour was already at the air port to welcome his father’s guest. 2. It is conventional to wear Arab clothes when travelling in the interior of Saudi Arabia, especially when visiting the King. I had suggested to Lord Wavell before he left Cairo that he should conform with this practice, and his willingness to do so gave great pleasure in this country. In the King’s private apartments at the Khuzan Palace, where the visitors rested briefly before con tinuing their journey, a carnivalesque atmosphere of private theatricals reigned while sirwals and thoba were distributed and assumed, Arab cloaks draped, and white head-dresses fastened with a gold fillet. Breakfast, when it came, was more of a masquerade than a meal. 3. The King had made it clear that he expected me to accompany the Viceroy to Riyadh and, with your permission, I gladly did so, having ascertained that this would not inconvenience his Excellency. Lord Wavell invited the Emir Mansour to join his party in the Royal Air Force machine. I travelled in Ibn Baud’s private aeroplane, which had been sent to Jedda to escort Lord Wavell on his flight across the desert. Before leaving, I was happy to present my staff, including the Indian Vice-Consul and the Indian medical officer in charge of the legation dispensary, to the Viceroy. Of the flight, which was remarkably bumpy, the less said the better. 4. We arrived at Buwaib, a landing ground some 50 kilom. from Riyadh, three and a half hours after leaving Jedda. There the Emir Khaled, various Court dignitaries, and a spare set of Arab robes sent by the King, awaited the Viceroy. Another hour and a half’s drive brought us to Riyadh, where the Badia Palace had been organised for our stay. The Crown Prince, the Emir Saud, bade us welcome, and all hopes of a wash had to be postponed until after luncheon. It was by tdiat time 4 o’clock in the afternoon. It was shortly before luncheon that I recorded my twentieth coffee of the day. 5. Audience with His Majesty had been arranged for 5 o’clock, and for this we proceeded to the huge Qasr al Murabba, some miles from our palatial guest house. Ibn Saud’s delight in welcoming the Viceroy was manifest, and though conversational exchanges on this first occasion were—except for an urgent enquiry whether Mr. Churchill would win the elections—limited to the formalities of courtesy, the happiest atmosphere of mutual regard and goodwill was instantly established. Your own greetings to the King, which Lord Wavell delivered, were much appreciated. 6. Dinner was served on the palace roof, an hour or so after the sunset prayer. It was a simple meal, as Royal banquets go, and blessedly short for those unexercised in oriental sedentary attitudes. For music we had the reed-like voices of five blind devotees, chanting the Koran on a near-by roof, and the drone of a distant water-wheel. For background, Ibn Saud’s fantastic bodyguard, in their bravery of silks and gold. After dinner, rose-water and frankincense and per fumed oil were ceremoniously applied, and the King made the unusual gesture of conducting us to a point from which we could look down into his private wing of the palace. Then, having introduced a batch of about twenty of his sons, he settled down for a talk with the Viceroy. [67—47] 1 RECs, P*2 J 7. His Majesty had asked me whether it would be incorrect to speak of official matters to Lord Wavell during his visit, and I had assured him to the contrary. What he, in fact, asked was that India should help to relieve the great shortage of consumer goods in this country, and that various purchases made by two of his sons in a raid on India in 1943 should be licensed for export. Neither request is likely to commend itself to the Government of India, but Lord Wavell was good enough to say that he would see whether anything could be done. 8. The Viceroy then persuaded Ibn Baud to tell the story of his capture of Riyadh from the garrison of Ibn Rashid forty-odd years ago. His comments reminded the King that he had a field-marshal for an audience. “ Soldiers always understand each other,” His Majesty said; and he instructed the Emir Nasser, Governor of Riyadh, to show us, on our way home, the famous spear-point in the citadel door, and blood-stains, still startling on the wall, which remain from the night when young Abdel Aziz ibn Baud won the first of many desert victories. 9. The King’s gifts were sent to the Viceroy and his party, including the Royal Air Force officers of his aeroplane, after they had returned to the Badia Palace. Lord Wavell’s presents to Ibn Baud, which I took to him next day, included a beautifully illuminated manuscript of the Koran. “ He could not have given me a gift more precious,” the King remarked. 10. The Viceroy made an early start on the 4th June, as he had to join the Sunderland flying-boat at Bahrain at 9 a m. I remained in Riyadh at the King’s request. The Emir Khaled and Nasser accompanied Lord Wavell to Buwaib, to wish him Godspeed on their father’s behalf. 11. The Viceroy’s visit was, I think, a complete success. I fear that the circumstances of Arabian hospitality in June were occasionally arduous, but Lord Wavell took all discomforts in his stride and, if I may say so, matched the King’s simplicity and natural dignity with his own. The establishment of imme diately friendly relations was, perhaps, natural; but it was none the less pleasant to observe. 12. Some credit for removing the barriers of race and language must certainly go to Shaikh Izzedin Shawa, Director of Mines, Public Works and Transport in Jedda, who, at my suggestion, accompanied the party as interpreter when Mr. Mon, on doctor’s orders, was unable to travel. Shaikh Izzedin Shawa, a Palestinian political exile and Cambridge graduate, reserves his anti-British mood for the Zionist problem. His interpreting was supple and impeccable. 13. I am reporting in a separate despatch such developments as occurred after the Viceroy’s departure from Riyadh. 14. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to the Minister Resident in the Middle East. I have, &amp;c. L. B.

It was very interesting uxuugn strenuous, and I am glad to have met so interesting and impressive a personality. A^We were met at Jedda by the Minister, Grafltey-Smith, one of the Saudi Princes and two of the King's Ministers. The interpreter who was to have accompanied me was ill, and one of the King's Ministers, an intelligent Palestinian (a political refugee) interpreted for me very competently. We were given breakfast at Jedda and changed into Arab clothes. . - . - - - it 50 We arrived at a landing-ground about 50 miles from Riyadh in the early afternoon, where more Saudi Princes and officials were waiting to receive me. We were then driven across the* desert plateau to Riyadh and given lunch in western style at the guest-house, which was formerly the King's summer palace. After lunch I made my formal visit to H.M. and had a general talk with him. He had mounted a large guard- of-honour and the ceremonial was not unlike that used in India. On my way back to the guest-house I was shown a fairly new garden, to illustrate what can be done in this desert, country when water is available. We returned to the Palace in the evening for an official banquet in the Arab style. Alter dinner H.M. showed me over a part of the Palace, and we had a further long conversation. He was most friendly and told me, among other things, the story of how he captured Riyadh more than 40 years ago. He kept off official subjects but mentioned in passing Saudi Arabia's need for consumer goods from India. I was given to understand by the interpreter, who also spoke to Jenkins on the subject, that what was in the King's mind was the refusal of the Government of India to give export licences to two of ins sons and one of his Ministers who wished, to. export motor cars, medicines and other things from India in large quantities contrary to our regulations. I am having this matter looked into again. As I had shown interest in the capture of Riyadh the King had me taken, on my way back to the guest-house, to the fort in the town, where the fighting took place. On our return to the guest-house we were given the traditional presents and I sent my presents to H.M. We left early on the morning of 5th June, but arrived rather behind time at Bahrein where we rejoined the flying- boat. King Ibn Baud seemed to be in good health and full of vigour. Grafltey-Smith was with me until I left Riyadh and intended to stay there for a day or two in order to have a further interview with the King.■■■■ UNOFFICIAL NOTE BUREAU OF PUBLIC INFORMATION GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (Unofficial notes are Issued on the understanding that their source will not be referred to in any way in what is published) No. F. 60/2/45-Pub, lord mTOL' 3 VISIT to Riyadh king ibn SWD’s guest Shortly afW His Excellency field Marshal Lord Wavell arri ved in London H.M.

In latter case could you or His Majesty’s Ambassador please arrange for suitable interpreter to accompany Viceroy and return in aircraft which will be taking Viceroy to Riyadh? 5.
