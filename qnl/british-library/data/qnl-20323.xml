My dear Gilbert, Xou will remember that eerly last May it became necessary (in order to get the way clear for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession; to settle very hurriedly with Fowle the question of the future arrongeraents for jurisdiction over foreigners in Qatar. Owing to the need for haste we were unfortunately unable here to keep our legal advisers in touch with the develojuents, but Beckett was good enough to go into the matter shortly afterwards and I enclose, for your information and any obsenrutiona which you may have to offer, a copy of a minute that he wrote on the subject on May 15th. 2. ao far as we can see, the inconsistency pointed out in the second paragraph of Beckett's minute is due to the fact that in the course of the negotiations viith the bheikh of Qatar about jurisdiction the practice has arisen o± rulerring to the subjects of the Arab States of the I'ersi an Gulf as British protected parsons for the purposes of jurisdiction within the Gulf itself. These persons apparently have been, nd are, considered as British rx oiiected persons not only for the purpose of consular and diplomatic protection throughout the world, but also generally fo r the purpose of jurisdiction in other parts of the world, e.g. Chine and Kgypt; but so far as we are aware they hare never before been classified as British protected persons for the purposes of jurisdiction within B the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf. 1 3. The confusion resulting from the present system H by which the subjects of Arab States in the Gulf are described/ j : .i •eltHwaite, 0.1.E. { ; ! !a. described, in most cases, as ''British protected persons' while remaining in the claas of subjects of foreign Moslem States for the purposes of jurisdiction in the Gulf itself, is unsatisfactory, but with one exception (referred to below; does not appear likely to lead to practical difficulties in the present case, since we haTe agreed to the SheiJch of ^atar retaining jurisdiction oyer 'the subjects of Koweit, Bahrein end the Trucita Coast,' and the latter sire only referred to as British protected persons by implication in the words '... all other British protected persons . . .' in paragraph 4 of the Kesident's letter Mo.C/l&lt;d9 of May 11th to the Sheikh* Moreover, you wlXX see that Beckett in paragraph 4 of his minute of May 15th has suggested how the position could be regularised in the eventual ^atar Order in Council by an addition to the definition of a British protected person for the purposes of the Order as given in article 4 of the Koweit Order in Council of last February. 4. 'The exception referred to above where the position does appear unsatisfactory is the case of subjects of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. The Sheikh of Qatar has not claimed to retain jurisdiction over the Muscatis, end it appears necessary, in view of the terms of paragraph 4 of the letter 0 1£ 9 to the Sheikh, to decide whether the Suit fin 1 s subjects are to be considered, for the purposes of the eventual Qatar Order in Council, as British protected persons or as subjects of a Moslem foreign State. It seams to us important to take a definite decision on this point since if ...uscatis ere treated as British protected persons disputes between them and British subjects or the subjects of non-Moslem foreign States would come under/3.

He points oat thet paragraph 3 of this letter contains the following two amissions as compared with paragraph 3 of the aesidant's earlier letter to the SheiMi Yj vV the aaae subject. Ho.c/114 of April iQJh last;- £ Britiah protected pereons ere not mentioned although they were included in the letter of April 18th between the words 'Britiah subjeote' end 'the subjects of non-Moslem foreign Jowers'. It is not clear whether this omission ia deliberate or not - we notice that the Sheikh himself /| omitted to mention thorn in paragraph 3 of his letter Ho.7/54 oi April 18th - but Beckett thinks we must proceed on the basis that it is Intended to include British protected persons in this class for the purposes of disputes coming before the proposed joint court. (b; Shere is no mention in the letter C/129 of May 11th of disputes between British subjects, British protected persons and non-fioslem foreigners on the one hand, find Moslem xoisigners on the other hand, although the words 'or the aubjaots of Moslem foreign Bowers' did follow the words q'your subjects' in paragraph 3 of Fowls'a letter to the Sheikh ^ M C/ll4 ox.April 18th. Although the Sheikh agreed to this in ' ^paragraph 3 of his letter lfo.7/54 of i S pril 18th (subject to the proviso that he would not be responsible for any objection which might be raised to this arrangement by GoTemuents of Moslem foreign States; the point is simply dropped/ I /V TND 4* dropped in the letter of May iltlx. Beckett thinks we nust in this case as well proceed on the assumption that the Sheikh has agreed to what we want; 'but he points out that this means that the jurisdiction granted to His Majesty's Government loj the Sheikh imfortunateij cannot now be based on the exchange of letters of May 11th only, but must rest upon the other two letters of April lath as well. fMs may be ail right for practical purposes, but, as Beckett points out, the matter is not left in em regular and satisfactory a state as one could wlaiu 6 # Another point about which Beckett and I are not very happy is the use in Powle 1 s letters to the Sheikh of the expressions n subjects of noB-Mosleiii foreign Powers 11 and ' subjacta of Moslem foreign Powers' • We feel that in view of recant developments the criterion of a Moslem Power (State) is now very imprecise - e.g. the oac-e of Turkey, where there is no longer any State religion - and we should have preferred to have used the words 'Moslem foreigners 11 instead# Beckett remembers having raised this point in connexion with the recent Koweit Order in Council, and although the expression 'Moslem State' was retained in that Order he is inclined to thinks (a view with which I strongly agree; that we ought now to consider the use of a new and more up to date formula (distinguishing between the religions of individuals rather than of States) when the time comes to prepare the Qatar Order in Council. 1 understand from Ward, who has discussed the matter with Crombie, that you have not yet taken any .steps towards preparing the Qatar Order in Council. When the time comes to do 00 I think that it would be mast useful, subject to your views, for our two departments to get into touch at an «arly stage with a view to considering the various points mentioned in this letter and any other difficulties that may arise/L 5. arice» I hear that Crombie expressed the opinion that we should be able to regularise the position and get round any omissions in Fowl®*© oorreepondenoe with the Sheikh when drafting the actual leras of the Order in Council, and that you are thinking of showing the Sheikh the draft Order in Council before it is completed, with a view to securing his formal concurrence in its terns and putting beyond doubt exactly what jurisdiction he has agreed to cede to us* Tours ever, (wBo ammm BmimL.) 1 3400/5400/91) I have read through these papers and the position* as it appears to me, is as follO¥/s» At the raoment, as a matter ot strict law, it would he difficult to establish that the Sheikh of Qatar has not jurisdiction over all persons in his territories* whether British subjects, other foreigners or otherwise. We propose, however, to obtain from him a grant of jurisdiction. The grant will take the fo rm of letters exchanged with the political resident* fhen having acquired our jurisdiction from the Sheikh, we shall have to make provision for its exercise and this means the passing of an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act# I gather that the jurisdiction which it is contemplated we shall acquire under the exchange of letters with the Sheikh is as follows# His Majesty will have jurisdiction in Qatar over all British subjects, all British protected persons other than the natives of Koweit, Bahrein and the uheikhs of the Tracial Coast and of course Qatar subjects I themselves who are# I suppose, British protected persons, and il 1 all foreigners who are not subjects of a loslem State# The Sheikh of ^atar will thus retain jurisdiction himself in respect of Qatar subjects, natives of Koweit, Bahrein and the frucial Coast and nationals of Moslem States, an expression which will, I suppose, cover Saudi Arabians, Irakis and Persians# I gather that we consider (and I see myself no reason to dissent from this view), that natives of uscat would be regarded for this purpose as British protected persons and not as being foreigners, nationals of a Moslem State# (I feel a little uncertain whether, when the Koweit Order was drafted, it was understood that in Koweit the natives/-r 2. natives of the other Sheikhdoms on the Persian Quit were to be regarded as British protected person© and not as foreigners nationals of a Moslem State coming under the Jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Koweit for the purposes of that Order* They are undoubtedly British protected persons, but I cannot help thinking that the Sheikh of Koweit, when he agreed to the terms of the order in Council, thought that these persons would be in the other category* Consequently, I think there is some danger of their being some x inconsistency between the two oases, and I am not sure that the attention of the India Office ought not to be called to i t) • Mixed cases, that is to say cases between parties, one of whom is a person subject to our jurisdiction and the other is a person subject to the sheikh's jurisdiction, are to come before a 'joint court 11 • The exact jurisdiction which we acquire will, of course, depend upon the interpretation of the text of the letters when they are exchanged but, assuming that the result is what I have set out above, we shall, I imagine, .aake a Qatar Order in Council a the fbllowlng lines. Generally speaking, it would be based upon the .Co we it Order in Council, 1955* As regards the definitions which come in Article 4, upon which the jurisdiction conferred in Article 8 depends, we should have to insert in the definition of '♦British protected person' of the Koweit Order something on the following lines after the words ''but does not include* 1 in line 4:- ?, a national of Bahrein, Koweit or the Crucial Sheikhs 4 '# Further, in Part 5 of the Order in Council, which deals with mixed cases, it would be provided that these cases should go before a joint court (compare on this point/1 3 point Part 6 of the Bahrein Order in Council and the definition of 'joint court' in Article 4).

With reference to 'The Shaikh of ^atar wished to ■ / retain jurisdiction only over subjects of Kuwait, Muscat and the Trucial Coast (see paragraph 6 (1) and (2) of my telegram of 22nd i^pril Mo.372)# Muscatis should therefore be treated as British protected persons, as they are treated at Bahrain ? vide my paragraph 3 above r 6.

Personally I do not think that the term 'Muslim foreigner' suggested by the Foreign Office is a very happy one since for purposes of jurisdiction it lays stress on a man's personal religion instead ,pf on his nationality. If this term were used all Muslim subjects of non*Muslim foreign Powers would cone unaer the jurisdiction of the Shaikh, e.g. a North African Muslim subject of France* But this would clash with the cession by the Shaikh of juris diction over all foreigners • Furth^F the use of this term if pushed to its logical conclusion would mean that a man by changing his religion would change his judicial status vis a vis the Shaikh and ourselves, e.g. a Frenchnian so long as he remained a non-Muslim would come under British juris diction 5 on becoming a Muslim however he would I pso facto come under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh 1 1 am sending copies of this letter to Acheson and Cole. c (Copy sent to Mr.Acheson &amp; Capt.Cole under P.L.No. C/244 of 26/7/35). it58/6 Telegram R. 27 F rom His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To Political Resident, in LUPIN, Repeated Political Agent, Kuwait.

No.C/243 of 26th July last, about jurisdiction over foreigners in qatar, where you state that 'the subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf have always been treated as British protected persons in the Gulf' (i.e. for jurisdictional purposes). This statement does not square with the position as we in this Office have always imagined it to be under the Orders in Council at Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat, and you will remember that we had some discussion with you on the subject while you were here. Since the question may affect the definition of the expressions 'British protected person', 'ijatar subject' (or 'national') and 'foreigner' in the new Qatar Order in Council which ble . we / -Col.T.C.Fowle, C.B.S., he Residency, BushireI / 2. we propose to suggest to the Government of India should now 'be produced, it seems desirable that we should know where we stand and that the matter should therefore 'be further investigated. With a view to this 'being done I shall attempt to set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 below the position as we understand it at Bahrein and Koweit, and I should be grateful for your comments on these paragraphs. We do not appear to have any papers on the position at Muscat but in order to make quite sure we should be glad if you could confirm that Bahreinis, Koweitis and 'Trucial Coast is' are treated at Muscat as 1 British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes. 2. Bahrein . The Bahrein Order in Council of 1913 provides for the jurisdiction of the Political Agent over British subjects including British protected persons but this Order in Council wasdrawn up in the light of the Sheikh's representations that his delegation of jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government in 1909 was intended only/c \x&gt; only 'to cover subjects of recognised powers and not the dependants of petty Arab potentates in the Gulf', and it appears that the Order in Council was intended to meet the Sheikh's representations in this respect. It is true that at Bahrein jurisdiction over natives of Koweit, Muscat, qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms is at present exercised by the political Agent and not by -the sheikh, but it would seem that this is not because these persons are regarded as 'British protected persons' in the ordinary sense but because in 1920 as the result of protests received from Ibn Saud and the Sheikh, of ^atar regarding the exercise of jurisdiction over their subjects by the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Political Agent issued a notice that all foreign subjects including Persians and subjects of the Arab Rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. In this connection please see paragraphs 9 and 11 of the India Office Memorandum Wo.B.422, copies of which were sent to India and Bushire with Walton T s demi-official letters of 13th Marcji, 1930, No.P. 1632/30. It would be interesting 1 to/\ I 4- to icnow whether natives of Koweit, Muscat, Qatar and the Trucial sheikhdsoms are in fact registered by the political Agent at Bahrein under the provisions of the Order in Council as British protected persons, though their non-registration might not 'be a conclusive argument (see paragraph 5 below)• 3. Koweit . In connection with the issue of the original Koweit Order in Council in 1925, the Sheikh of Koweit delegated to His Majesty 1 s Government jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons and the subjects ancfcrotected persons of non-Muslim foreign p Governments (reference Bushire letter 10.2517 of 19th December 1925 to the Government of India). Although the correspondence itself is not e^q)licit on the point we have always understood here that the Sheikh ! s surrender of jurisdiction over British protected persons was not intended to deprive him of his own jurisdiction over natives of the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, particularly in view of the Bahrein/6. Bahrein precedent mentioned above» As you will remember, our understanding has since been confirmed v by a reference to Dickson, and I enclose herewith a litical Resident dated 5th October/) ^ copy of the telegram which political Agent dated 7th October r ) L~ v/e sent at your suggestion f /r together with a copy of Dickson ! s reply. 4. On the general question of the meaning of the phrase 'British protected person' it would no doubt be generally agreed that the phrase is a vague one whi«h is susceptible of varying interpretations, and that in practice it can be and is interpreted for different purposes in different ways in accordance with what happens to suit us best in any particular case» It is also generally agreed that the term 'British protected person' used in its widest sense would cover the natives of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government and these persons are included as a last category of British protected persons in the Consular Instructions. In the stricter sense, however, the expression 'British protected person/A person' bears the ordinary meaning of 'a native of a British protectorate, protected State, or mandated territory' and we have always been chary of admitting that the Arab States of the Gulf are British protected States and have preferred to describe them as being 'in special treaty relations with His Majesty ! s Government' * 5. In this connection it may be remembered that although 'British protected persons' have to be registered at the political Agency under the provisions of the Bahrein Order in Council it was ruled in 1931 with the concurrence of the Foreign Office that it was not necessary for the Political Agent to register sucn persons as natives of the Hadramaut (which is now included in the Aden Protectorate) but only British y n protected persons proper (reference correspondence noted-' Bushire 'etter'Ho.'l762 of 22nd August 1921 ^ in the margin).

In view of the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and the delegation by the Sheikh to His Majesty's Government of jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons and the subjects of non-Muslim foreign powers, the Marquess of Zetland, after consultation with the Foreign Office, is of the opinion that the position should now be regularised as soon as possible by the issue of an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, defining the extent of His Majesty's jufTsdrctlon in ^atar. His Lordship would therefore suggest that if no objection is seen, a draft Qatar Order in Council should now be prepared by the Government of India, in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and*'forwarded to the Secretary of State for final consideration by His Majesty's Government. The new Order in Council would be on the same lines mutatis mutandis as the Koweit Order in Council, 1935. 2/ he Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi.- 2 - 3L Q 1&gt;i 2. Since there Is at present no resident Political Agent In Qatar, It Is proposed that His Majesty's jurisdiction In Qatar should, In the first Instance at any rate, be exercised through the Political Agent at Bahrein or his representative, and It Is accordingly suggested that the expression 'Political Agent' should be defined In the new Order In Council so as to Include the Political Agent at Bahrein or his representative, or any Political Agent who may subsequently be appointed to reside In Qatar 3. With regard to the definition In the new Order In Council of the expressions 'British protected person', 'Qatar subject' and 'foreigner', I am to refer to the demi-official correspondence noted In the margin, from which It will be ) Foreign Office demi-official / letter of 18th July with seen that under the enclosure (copy forwarded by Air Mall of 19th July under ^ Kowelt, Bahrein and No. P.Z.4926/35). 9 Muscat Orders In ) Demi-official letter No.C/243 of 26th July from the Political { Council, as at present Resident In the Persian Gulf. ) % „ . ) drafted, there Is some ) Mr. Clausen's demi-official S letter of 14th October to { possibility of the Political Resident (copy ) forwarded by Air MalL of 14th uncertainty arising as ' October under No. P.2.7185/35)) • wketker subjects of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf in special Treaty relations with His Majesty's Government should, or should not 9 be treated as British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes« In view of the fact that K* 3? it has been agreed in correspondence exchanged between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Sheikh of Qatar that jurisdiction over the nationals of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms should continue to be exercised by the Sheikh, it seems desirable that in order to avoid any uncertainty on thispoint the expression 'British protected person' should be specifically defined in the Qatar Order in Council so as to exclude the subjects of the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial States, as suggested in Mr. Beckett's minute of 18th July 1935, a copy of which was enclosed in the Foreign Office demi-official letter of 18th July 1935. As regards the position of Muscat subjects under the new Order in Council, the Secretary v*' ii' ■ ii I mil inMn-tnf of State would welcome an expression of the Government of India's views in due course. As at present advised, he is inclined to agree with the view expressed in paragraph 4 of Colonel Powle's demi-official letter of/ 26th July that Muscatis should be treated. In Qatar as British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes, and he would suggest that in that case it might be as well to define 'British protected persons' so as to include specifically subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. 4. I am also to invite attention to the Foreign = #v Office suggestion mentioned in paragraph 6 of^JMr.Ttendel's letter of 18th July and in paragraph 7 of Colonel Fowle's 1 letter of the 26th July already referred to, that in ^ the Qatar Order in Council the religion of individuals, rather than of States, should be adopted as the criterion in distinguishing foreigners under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent from foreigners under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. In this connection I enclose copies of further demi- orelgn Office, dated 28th { August, 1935. \ official correspondence with the Foreign Office, dated S 30th September, 1935) Foreign Office. It will be seen that the Foreign Office have stressed the point that the expression 'Muslim Statef' as used in the definition of 'Koweit subject' in Article 4 of the Koweit Order in Council, 1935, is now somewhat imprecise. Moreover, theForeign Office suggestion would no doubt be acceptable to the Sheikh as tending 9 in theory at any rate, to bring more Muslims under his jurisdiction. On the other hand ? it may be argued that no difficulty is likely to arise in practice by retaining the phraseology used in the Koweit Order in Council, particularly if a provision is included in the Qatar Order corresponding to Article 8(2) of the Koweit Order, which gives the Political -Resident power to decide as to the status of any person in doubtful cases, and that if the Foreign Office suggestion were adopted, and the expression 'Qatar subject' consequently defined in the Qatar Order in Council so as to include 'any person, not being a British subject, who is a Muslim', it is conceivable that some European power might object to its Muslim subjects (who might in some cases be themselves Europeans) being placed in a different category from British Muslims for jurisdictional purposes., The Secretary of State has no very strong views on the question. He would be glad, in due course, to peceive the views of the Government of India, 5. When the draft Qatar Order in Council has been approved by His Majesty 1 s Government, it is suggested that it might be communicated to the Sheikh of Qatar for his formal concurrence, as was done in the case of the Koweit Order in Council, 1935, before it is finally submitted to His Majesty in Council, 6. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Bahrein, I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, #1^. CX WALTON.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.fl. 1. 28th August, 1935. liydear 'Ward, Would you kindly refer to Rendel's letter to Lalthwalte, dated 18th July, No.E.3400/3400/91, on the subject of the future arrangements for jurisdiction over foreigners in Qatar. A copy of this letter and Beckett's note was sent privately to Fowle, a copy of whose reply I now enclose. Paragraph 6 of his letter does not entirely answer paragraph 5(b) of Rendel's letter, but it seems clear that for practical purposes it will be all right to depend on the double exchange of letters between Fowle and the Sheikh, and not merely on the single exchange of May 11th. As regards paragraph 7 of Fowle's letter, the objections to the term 'Muslim foreigner' certainly appear to be formidable, and personally I should have thought that there might be something to be said for sticking to the old form of words 9 in the absence of any special reason to suppose that it will 5 in fact, cause difficulties. However, if the Foreign Office feel strongly on this matter it might be discussed with Fowle when he is in London, It is now perhaps time that we got on with the actual drafting of the Order in Council which presumably should be done, as in the case of the Koweit Order in Council, by the Government of India in the first/ .G. Ward, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W, 1.first place. Copies will be sent to us for final consideration, In consultation with the Foreign Office, and to. the Resident. When the final draft Is approved, It may be communicated, as was done In the case of the Kowelt Order, to the Sheikh of Qatar for his formal concurrence. If you agree generally with this programme I will put It up here. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) M.J. CLAUSON.P.Z.6972/35. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 30th September, 1935. (E 5247/3400/91) Dear Clauson, Will you please ^refer to your letter of the 28th August to Ward, covering a copy of Colonel Fowle's letter No. C/243 -or the 26th July to Lalthwalte (P.Z.5303/35) on the subject of jurisdiction over foreigners in Qatar. 2. Beckett, to whom Fowle's letter has been shown, regards as very interesting the assurance in paragraph 3 that subjects of Arab States of the Persian Gulf have always been regarded when in the territory of another Arab state of the Gulf as British protected persons for jurisdictional purposes, e.g. that for these purposes a Bahraini is in Muscat a British protected person and not the 'subject of a non-Christian power and not 'represented by a Consul at Muscat'. 3. This statement of the position does not square with Beckett's earlier impression, derived from discussions with the India Office. But presumably Fowle is the man who knows and his assurance ranoves the inconsistency to which attention was drawn in ueckett's minute of the 15th May and in Mendel's letter V of 18th July (E 3400/3400/91) to Laithwaite in which a copy of that minute was enclosed. The point need therefore no longer be pursued. 4. Before proceeding, however, it may be vorth pointing out that the existence of this practice cannot oe supported by a reference to the position at Bahrain, Clauson, Escf. since/since all foreigners at Bahrain, Including the nationals of other Moslem States, come under British jurisdiction. 5. As regards paragraphs 4-6 of Powle's letter, Beckett agrees with you that the grant of jurisdiction from the Sheikh of Qatar has to be based on all four letters exchanged, and not on the exchange of the 11th May only. This may not matter very much, hoxvever, especially If the usual course Is followed of getting the Sheikh to approve the draft Order-ln-Councll as giving effect correctly, on the Jurisdictional points, to the exchanges of letters. 6. With regard to paragraph 7 of Powle's letter, Beckett does not regard as conclusive the objections to the expression 'Moslem foreigner' which we had suggested. On particular points In that paragraph he has made the following observations:- (a) 'If this term were used all Moslem subjects of 'non-Moslem foreign powers would come under the 'jurisdiction of the Sheikh, e.g. a North African Moslem 'subject of Prance'. This Is quite correct, but It Is what we Intended. (b) 'But this would clash with the cession by the 'Sheikh of jurisdiction over all foreigners'. Surely this is not quite correct, since the Sheikh is not ceding jurisdiction over all foreigners, but is in any case retaining jurisdiction over certain of them, viz. nationals of Moslem States, as well as Koweitis, Bahrainis, etc. (See paragraph 3 of the letter No. C/114- of the 18th April to the Sheikh). It is merely a question of the best way of defining the foreigners who are exempted from the cession.(c) 'The use of this term...would mean that a man !l by changing his religion would change his judicial 'status.ag. a Frenchman so long as he remained a non- Moslem would come under British Jurisdiction; on 'becoming a Moslem however he would ipso facto come 'under the jurisdiction of the Sheikhl' This is quite true: but Beckett does not see anything very objectionable in it. The whole point, as he sees it, is that Moslem tribunals, such as the Sheikh's, may be suitable for Moslems but are not suitable for other people; and a change of religion will at the present moment in Palestine, Egypt, Persia (see No.12 of the 'Safeguards') and indeed in many other countries have the effect of altering the tribunals to which an individual is subject, in certain classes of cases at any rate. 7. It may, of course, be better in making the Qatar Order-in-Counc11, to keep the expression 'national of a Moslem State', which was used in the Koweit Order and which appears by implication ('non-Christiarf) in the Muscat Order of 1915, just because it exists in those other Orders, and because we may not wish to introduce the change for the first time in the matar Order. We are not sure however that there is very much in this, and still think that 'Moslem foreigner' is a better criterion than 'national of a Moslem State'. 8. But in any case we agree with the progranme for the drafting of the Order which you outline in paragraph 4 of your letter. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

Jurisdiction over foreigners. 2. I confirm that in Bahrain Kuwaitis, Trucial Coastis and Muscatis are treated as British protected persons for .lurisdictinn«l purposes, i.e., that they come under the Political Agent and not under the Shaikh. I would qualify this to the extent that a child i of a Kuwaiti, Trucial Coasti or Muscat! born in Bahrain is treated (under the Notices of 19S9) as a Bahrain subject unless he is registered as a foreigner in the Agency (there are three exanples of this, two Kuwaitis and one Umm al Qaiwairal). S. I concur with the reply to the India Office set forth in the second paragraph of your Express Letter. 4. I unfortunately cannot trace certain papers on the subject, 1 of the past existence of which I know, but my recollection of /Shaikh m fp—400s&amp; P—(m-480)—26-7-34—2,00,000.Shaikh *133*3 day is that he did not really mind about t Oinanis and not very much about Qataris, but that he was exceedingly sore at Najdis and Hasawis being under the Political Agent; indeed, the battle over a Hasawi would develop almost into personal combat I 5. In reply to paragraphs 5 and 4 of your Express Letter, natives of Kuwait, Muscat sh # Qatar and Trucial Shaikhdoms are not registered as British protected persons, because for the purpose of registration, as opposed to jurisdiction, they have not been regarded as ^British subjects 11 (though the term includes British protected persons; see Article 2/1 of ^The Bahrain (Amendment^ Order in Council, 1922 v and in the definition in Article 4 of the Bahrain Order in Council 1913). As far as I am aware no person in these categories has ever asked to be registered as a British protected person, though they come under the Political Agent if involved in criminal or civil proceedings. As a partial modification of the position described in the last sentence, a child born in Bahrain to persons in these categories is treated finder the Notices of 1S23) as a Bahrain subject unless he is registered in the Agency (of this there are three examples, two Kuwaitis and one Umm al Qaiwaini). 6. I regret the delay in sending the above reply but have been searching for the papers to which I have referred above, 7. With reference to the enclosures to Printed Letter P.^Z.7531 of November 29th, 1S35, from the India Office, I am inclined to think that the category ''Moslem foreigner 8 unduly widens the sphere of the Shaikh*s jurisdiction. For example, had the matter reported in paragraph 53 of my Intelligence Report No;5 of 1.&amp;54 developed, it might have been embarrassing if Mr. El Makki, a French Moslem subject, had been under the juris diction of the Shaikh and his companion under that of the Political Agent* But the likelihood of such cases arising would /notJ 'V Confidential .

Exercise of Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreign Subjects in Bahrein by the British Political Authorities. Jurisdiction over British Subjects. 1. Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government provides that ' all offences which they (British subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.' Jurisdiction in Cases affecting 1 Foreigners. 2. By the Agreement of 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1892, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty's Government ; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within his territory without the assent of His Majesty's Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty's Government. Responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as having passed to His Majesty's Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3. The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that ' Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. 'As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Lr. d. 4 May iqoi, Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a ^VofLDesp^v matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any of 9 May '1901 disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the p - 614/G1 - event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin may be instructed to this effect.' The action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved Secret Desp. to by His Majesty's Government. 21 june i9oi^ 6 ' of 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. P ' 2063/01 ' Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows :—' In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with Lr. from gl of 1. to the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be Poi.Re S .,No.ii56E^ referred to the British authorities.

No dispute involving the question of jurisdiction over foreigners appears to have arisen in Bahrein until 1904. In 1904^-5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the lirst of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Wonckhaus—became involved in a brawl, in the course of which he suffered personal injuries. Failing, as he thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to whom his lirst complaint was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to the German Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the subject. His Excellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added 'I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government' and I cannot say anything on the subject.' The Foreign Office at a later stage instructed the Charge d'Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state that it had been brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government, and that a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political Resident ' for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.' 6. In the second case (November 1901), an accidental quarrel havin* arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh's nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty's Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as 'I have had a long talk with the British'Minister . . . and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.' The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on the question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference ' in cases between Aiabs and 1 ersians, who were all Mohammedans,' and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice to the Shiah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to His Excellency. He accepted the demands of His Majesty's Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the lohtical Agent appears thenceforth to have beendefinitely established, as a a matter of practice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. 7. Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners m-the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. was c eeiuer that it was desirable to obtain a formal request from the bheikh^that he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners. After Tonn 1 - 1 0llt ^ 1 Agent ' His Excellency addressed the latter on Ibth July 1309, in the following terms ' After compliments.

(2) Foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction hy His Majesty. (3) Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners ; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. (4) The expression 'person to whom this Order applies' shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) The property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article (2) and of Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. (6) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article (2) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order; provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.' 10. Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted -above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows : — ' (a) Criminal. Article 41.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (б) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Mahommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (2) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 1861/ i: * * See para. 1 above.4 (b) Civil. Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a .suit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the » Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and (а) with the concurrence of the ^ Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (б) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (V) with the consent o£ the several parties, may refer the case to. one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to ih Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (e) shall be final, and shall not be. open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty ol: misconduct in the matter. (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Ccmrt, the^ Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Kazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi lor the administration of an oath.' 11. At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of; foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty's Government. Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and p. 5040/20. inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Saud asfo the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over Nejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have been made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on Ee8^ 8 e / s 27 'to Po1 ' th( : ir behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November g. of i., No. 295 s, 1920 a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of traSf' 1927 ' Arab llulers ai ? d other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. Hie decision was not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British Political authoritiea within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922. as subsequently amended.

Bushire, the 13th February 1936. pb Could you please refer to the last two sentences of paragraph 1 of your demi-official letter No. P.Z.7185/35, dated the 14th October 1935, on the juridical position of subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf vis-a-via the Rulers of other similar States. 2* the position can be summarised as follows:- A. Bahrain* (1) Subjects of other Arab States in the Gulf are juridically treated as British protected persons, i # e. they come under the Political Agent not the I ^ Shaikh. It would appear that when the Political Agent issued the notice referred to in paragraph 2 of India Office letter Ho.P.3.7185 covering all foreign subjects, it should presumably only have covered qataris and Hejdis (Saudi subjects). But, as in practice, jurisdiction over foreign subjects and British protected persons has been exercised for many years by the Political Agent without any objection from the present Shaikh, there would hardly seem any necessity now to raise the question of our right to this juris diction. (g) Subjects of Kuwait, Muscat, Qatar, and Trucial Shaikhdoms are not registered as British protect ed persons, because for the purposes of registra tion, as opposed to jurisdiction, they have not been / J. Clausen Esquire, The India office, London.O- -2- been regarded as^British subjects^, although the term includes British protected persons (see Article 2 (l) of •♦The Bahrain (Amendment) Order in Council, 1922 t, and in the definition in Article 4 of ^The Bahrain Order in Council, 1913*'). As far as I am aware, no person in these categories has ever asked to be registered as a British protected person, though they come under the Political Agent if involved in civil or criminal proceedings.

In general terms I think that the draft Qatar Order-in-Council might be based on the existing Bahrain and Kuwait Orders-in-Counc11, though I should prefer it to be as simple as possible. 3. I would, however, suggest that in the Schedule of Indian Acts applied to Qatar mention of the Indian Post Office Act should be omitted, as it would at once raise suspicions in the Shaikh's mind that the Order-in-Counc11 might impose a post office upon him and so make the Order- in-Council more difficult to negotiate. I ain doubtful whether it would be wise to apply the Indian Companies Act, as has been done in Kuwait. In s. e. practice/ MFP—.-400S&amp;p~(M.480&gt;—26-7-54—2,00,000.practice, i n a P lace like Qatar, I should prefer, as in Balirain, to deal with matters under local custom as Indian Acts (such as, for example, the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act, Indian Companies 1 Act, while useful to the Political Agent as a guide, are too complicated for local conditions/^ 5. I am not in a position to form an opinion whether it is appropriate to apply to Qatar the Acts mentioned in Sections 12 and 13 of the 'Kuwait Order-in-Council 1955'• 6.

Dated 3irala,the August 1936. mm smotma IN otiimTL. Sir. . With feference to your latter No.P.-..7591/35, dated the 29th Novamber 1935 I am directed to forward for final consideration by His i ajosty's Govermeut a draft siatar Order in Council, which has bam prepared in consultation with the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, and is on the same lines mutatis mutfmdiB at the Kuweit Order in Council, 1935 except as regards certain additions and alterations which are explained ;; below. 2. Article 4 of the draft. (i) The definition of 'British Protected iarson' is based on the information contained in paragraph 3 of the letter cited above. I am however to suggest with reference to the words shown within brackets that the specific inclusion of subjects of the Sultan of Muscat would appear to be both theoretically misconceived and practically inexpedient. It is theoretically misconceived becausesr because ^iS, hypothesl both (a) the subjects of the Oultan of Muscat and (b) the subjects of the ahaikhs of Bahrain, Kuwait and the Truclal dtates persons properly enjoying His Majesty's protection in ^atar, and there is^therefore, a need for a specific exclusion of (b) but not a specific inclusion of (a). It is practically inexpedient as it exhibits the subjects of the Sultan of Muscat as not being persons properly enjoying His Majesty's protection in ^atar or by necessary inference in Kuwait where their treatmeut as British protected persons for the purposes of the Kuwait Order rests on the hypothesis that they are persons properly enjoying His J/ajesty's protection. The Government of India therefore consider that the reference to the subjects of the Sultan of Muscat should be omitted from the definition. (ii) 'Qatar sublectB* nnd Torel The Foreign Office view appears to be that the criterion in defining 'Qatar subjects* should be not the religion of the State but the religion of the nationals. This view seems to the Government of India entirely reasonable nd in consonance with the trend of modem events and, if acted upon, Moslem foreigners will be atar subjects. It is however thought that this might lead to complications peeing that in 1316 neighbouring Sheikhdoms, the criterion is still the religion of the foreign State and not that of the subject. In the circumstances, the Government of India suggest that in view of the fact that the expression non-, oslem foreign power has bean used in the correspondence, it would not be in order to employ the expression 'Moslem foreigners'' unless the Shaikh consents to it. Further, it would be clearly inadvisable to have one criterion for the subjects of .atar and another for the subjects of the neighbouring jhuikhdoffis In the Gulf, where jurisdiction is ceded to the British Government. i-'or the sake of i, II I! mil m* ■ m „ ■ lm4 dt4.'fes* ^^ 0 uniformity, therefore, the Governuent of India have followed the phraseology.adopted In the Kuwait Order in Council in drafting definitione of 'Qatar subject 1 ' and'Foreigner*. (ill) Joint flourt. rnsputes hetween British subjects and subjects of non-fJoslm Par sign i ov.ers and (Jat&amp;r subject are required to ba tried by a Joint Court on which .olitical Agent and the yhaikh of f^atar or their representatives would sit. The term 'Joint Court' has therefore been added to Article 4 and its definition is based on the definition of a sisiilar term occurring in Article 4 j of the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913» (iv) 'Political AF-anf. The definition Is based on paragraph 2 of the letter cited above# ince the definition of Political Agent contemplates the subsequent appointment of a folitical Agent resident at Qatar, it is misleading: to provide in Article 7 for the contingency of the Political Agent's absence from Bahrain only. To meet requiieaents of the case, the words 'from aahraln* occurrli^ in the second line of Article 7 have been omitted. 3. Article 40. The word 'Article' has been substituted for the word 'section' occurring In the first line of sub-paragraph in the said Article, 4, Articles 51 ij*.; 52. Part V of' the draft Order, which deals with cases between parties, ona of whom is a person subject to our jurisdiction and the other to that of the JhaiKh, has been drafted on the lineslines of the part V of ths EaUraln Order in Council 1913» As ragarda the provisions ralatiag to Joint Courts in articles 51 and 52, tharo is no mention in the correspondence (vide express letter fro the Ycf '4 i olitical Resident in the iersian Gulf, :io»30i-3 t dated the 23rd ..»ril 1935) witii ahaitch of ^tar of reference to arbitration in the case of civil disputes. ; evertheless it seems desirable to insert a provision Bimilar to that contained in clause (e) of •\rticle 45(1) end sub Article 4 of that Article of the Bahrain Order in Council, i9lS, which merely enables the court, to refer the Hatter to arbitration with the consent of the Bsveral parties. Article 54 of the draft has therelore been allowed to stand as in the Kuwait Order. 5, Articia 84. To meet the case which has arisen on raore than one recent occasion of the rc ulation-taaJcinfc authority desiring to include in a King's egulation substantive provision for the imposition of punishaents sevarer than those ejtclusively adai Bible under sub- article (2), the three months'irapriaonaent provided therein has been increased to two years at the suggestion of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 6. Article 90 of the Kuwait crdar la JomiaU. This Article has been omitted froa the draft ^tar Order in Council as it is not required. The subsequent two paragraphs have therefore been re-nmabered as paragraphs 90 and 91. . ...2 iwait 4 In the construction of this Order and of any rules, regulations or Orders made thereunder, the following words and expressions have the meaning hereby assigned to them, unless there be some thing in the subject or context repugnant thereto, that is to say ' Administration ' means letters of administration, includ ing the same with will annexed, or granted for special or limited Durposes. or limited i 11 duration.

No.E.6 j 6E/208/91 on the subject of the draft Q,atar Order in Council. We- agree generally with the amendments suggested by the Foreign Office, and there are only two points on which we wish to offer observations, the first of which relates to the definition of JI Q,atar subject' in Article 4. We agree with you that it would be as well to discard the unsatisfactory definition used in the Koweit Order but we are not cleo,r whether the phrase 'Muslim person 11 used in your amended definition is intended to include or exclude 'Muslim Corporation'. If, as we assume, exclusion is intended, it may be as well to say so in the definition, if you agree. An alternative solution might be to omit the word 'person! 1 after 'Moslem'. Would you kindly let us know what you think. / Our other point is that a definition of the expressions 'person to whom this Order applies' and 'person sub ject/ Brenan, Esq., O.B.E., 'Foreign Office, S. W. 1.■subject to this Ord er n is contained in the penultimate paragraph of Article 4^ and in these circumstances no amendment 01 Article 8 appears to be required.

Z* The Government of India will observe that, as the result of correspondence with the Foreign Office (of which, copies have already been sent to them) the phrase 11 any person, not being a British subject, who is a national, of any other Moslem State' in the definition, of n Qatar subject^ in Article 4, has been changed to 'any Moslem person, other than a Corporation, not being a British subject'. The definition in its final form is thus not precisely in accordance with the agreement reached, in the Exchange of lotes with the Sheikh; it will therefore be necessary to explain the change to him and obtain his consent in writing. If the Government of India see no objection, I am to request that the political Resident may be instructed to approach the Sheikh on this point. In view of the considerations referred to in. the demi-official letter from, the Foreign Office dated the 18th July, 1935, of which a copy was sent to the Government of India by the air mail, of the 19th July, No. P.Z.49E6/35, it may be desirable for the Resident to set out fully in Ms communication to tne Sheikh the classes of persons and 'etary to the Government of India, cases/ 'eign and Political Department, Kew Delhi..V] X I ( O # cases in respect of which jurisdiction is to 'be .exercised, 'by the political Agent* 5* It is noted that the Resident (in his demi-officiaT letter Ho. 108-S of Slst January, 1.937) does not recommend that the draft Order in Council should be shown to the Sheikh, and it is proposed, unless the G-overnment of India see any objection, to accept the Resident T s Tiew in this matter • 4.

I visited Dohah on the 3rd and 4th February and discussed this matter in detail with the Shaikh of Qatar. The Shaikh had with him his sons Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Ali and his Secretary Saleh A1 Mana. 3. I began by explaining the proposed alteration in the defi nition of a Qatar subject, concentrating at first on the change from 'national of any other Moslem State' 1 to 'Moslem person'. It was at once evident that the Shaikh and his advisers were deeply suspicious and it took the best part of two hours to obtain their agreement even to this portion. Finally after two lengthy consulta-.: tions at the other end of the room, they appeared to be satisfied h that I had no deep under-hand object, designed to obtain greater transfer of jurisdiction than the Shaikh intended to give, and that j I was not deceiving them when I said that the object was to make the criterion an individuals personal religion rather than the State religion of his country of origin. The Shaikh is evidently (Signature) v er y/' if 3 S. 44. MFP~825S&amp;P—(M-1070)—14-9-34-10.000. (Designation) wmmm6/- very frightened of King rbn Saud and wanted me to give him a written assurance that the governments of foreign Moslem States would not object to his (i.e. the Shaikh 1 s) decisions in cases affecting non-British Moslems. I stated that he need have no anxiety provided he adheres to the principles of justice as re cognised in Mohammadan Law. 4. So far the discussion had been successful. Fo argument, however, would induce the Shaikh to agree to the exclusion of Corporations from this definition. He took his stand on the fact that there had been no mention of Corporations in previous discussions, and he said in effect that sooner than agree to this exception he would prohibit the formation or operation of any Moslem Corporation in Qatar. I was unable to make effective use of the arguments supplied in paragraph 2 of your Express lettlr under reference (in which the use of the word 'non-Moslem' is apparently an error), since it was evident that the Shaikh felt strongly that the persons or classes of persons over whom he had agreed to jurisdiction being exercised by His Majesty's Government were exclusive and that he retained jurisdiction over all others. It is true that he had never asked for or proposed jurisdiction over Moslem Corporations; nor on the other hand had we. Since ordinarily a 'person' 1 includes a 'Corporation', the absence of any reference^to a Moslem Corporation in previous discussions creates a presumption in favour of the Shaikh rather than in our favour. My personal view is that we should give way on this point. It seems to me highly improbable that any such Moslem Corporations would come into existence or operation in Qatar; and consequently no particular object is served by pur suing the point. In other words it seems to me an error to pre judice the attainment of our main object by insisting on pro viding for something which may never exist or which in any event is of little or no interest.-3- 5. When I came to the matter of explaining the classes of persons in respect of whom jurisdiction would be exercised by the Political Agent, an even greater difficulty arose over - 1 • fcJ-Cv ■ the provision in Article 8(iii) of the draft Qatar Order-in- Council to the effect that the Political Agent would exercise jurisdiction, even if only through the Joint Court, over Qatar subjects registered as being in regular service of British sub jects or foreigners♦ Admittedly a similar provision exists in the Bahrain and Kuwait Orders-in-Council (a fact which did not appeal to the Shaikh as being of the faintest importance), but the Shaikh and his advisers were evidently convinced that the result, if not the object, of this clause is to nullify his jurisdiction over non-British Moslems. Once more he took his stand on the fact that nothing remotely approaching such a pro vision had been mentioned in any previous discussion or communi cation. It is essential to remember that in Qatar we deal with people who are so intensely suspicious that no ordinary process of reason can be expected to prevail unless the Shaikh and his advisers can see clear and definite advantage to themselves. Here again I would enquire if a provision of this nature is ac tually essential. I do not of course know whether this provi sion has been found of any advantage in Kuwait, but so far as Bahrain is concerned it is a dead letter. I am unable to dis cover that any Bahrain subject is or has ever been registered at the Agency as being in the service of a British subject or foreigner, and even the Adviser to the Bahrain Government was ignorant of the existence of this provision in the Bahrain Ofder- in-Council. I have now discovered that the ostensible purpose of this provision in the Bahrain Order-in-Council was to obtain jurisdiction over Bahrain subjects in the domestic service of Britishers or foreigners, though of course it might well be argued/-argued that 'regular service' is not exclusively restricted to domestic service. In fact as the phrase at present stands it could be extended to service of any form whatsoever, provi ded only that it is regular. Thus in Bahrain the position which exists, and has apparently always existed, is that Bah rain subjects are within the jurisdiction of the Shaikh. I suggest that the same might well apply in Qatar, even allowing I for the fact that 'Qatar subject' includes non-British Moslem persons. So far as the latter are concerned I need only remark! that there is no very obvious reason why Petroleum Concessions I Limited, for example, should employ any non-British Moslem persons in 'regular service'. Even if service is held to be | synonymous with employment, so far as the operations of the Company are concerned^ disputes between the Company and ios employees automatically come before the Joint Court, under the provisions Part V of the draft Qatar Order-in-Council» 6, Briefly therefore the position is as follows.^The Shaikh of Qatar agrees to the substitution of Moslem Person (non-British) in place of 'national of any other Moslem State' On the other two points I see no prospect of obtaining his ag reement without recourse to extreme pressure. It is for con sideration whether these two points are of sufficient import ance to warrant extreme action, particularly since this must have repercussions on the relations between the Shaikh of Qa tar and the Oil Company, and since, even if that action is successful, the feeling will I fear undoubtedly remain in Qa tar that the agreement made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with the Shaikh has been dishonoured by us.

I enclose herewith a copy of report Ho. C/112-18/4 dated the 8th February 1938 from the Political Agent, Bahrain. It will be seen that the three points discussed are (a) the alteration of the wording of the definition of &gt;tar subject from 'national of any other Moslem ntate' to 'Toslem person' (b) the exclusion of 'Corporation' from this definition of Qatar subject and (c) the question of jurisdiction over Qatar subjects registered in the Poli tical Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or .

The words 'other than a Corporation 11 in the definition of Qatar subject clearly qualify the pre ceding phrases ^a subject of the Shaikh of Qatar or any other Moslem person' and must relate, therefore, exclusively to hy pothetical Qatar or Moslem Corporations. They cannot afxeet a British Corporation such as Petroleum Concessions Limited, which is covered by the dfinition of British subject, 'hia being so, no essential object is served by the insertion of the words 'other than a Corporation' in this particular de finition and I recommend their excision* 5. On the third point I agree fully with the Political Agent's comments# Here again no very definite object is in view and consequently it would be an error to arrive at the expected impasse with the Shaikh over a provision of this; nature. I suggest, therefore, that sub-paragraph (iii) of (l)(a; Article 8/should be eliminated# 6.

Political Agent, BahrainCopy of letter No. 0/333-18/4 dated the 21st Kay 1938 from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to Shaikh Abdullah bin Qaaim A1 Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar. After Compliments* I am sure you will remember the conversation which I had with you at Dohah on the 4th of F0bruary 1938 corres ponding to the 3rd Dhul Hijjah 1356, in regardto matters of jurisdiction over foreigners. I reported the substance of that conversation to the Honourable the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf and he has since informed His Majesty 1 s Government. I am now instructed to say that His Majesty^ Government note with satisfaction that in regard to foreigners you have agreed to the individuals personal religion rather than the State religion of his country of origin being the criterion whether he comes within your jurisdiction or the jurisdiction of the Rep« resentative of the British Government. This of course does not apply to British subjects since you have already agreed that all British subjects whether Moslem or Non- Moslem should come within the jurisdiction of the British Government's Representative. 2. In regard to the other matters which we discussed, and particularly in regard to the question of Moslem Cor porations, your views were carefully represented to His Majesty's eovernment and as a result the High British Go vernment does not wish now to pursue those matters further* 3. It now seems desirable to set out in a few clear and simple sentences exactly how jurisdiction in Qatar will be divided in accordance with the agreements reached between you and the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in April 1935 and between you and me at our discussions on the 4th February 1938* (i)A-2- / V ' V (i) You, C 1 Shaikh, will of course retain and exercise jurisdiction over all your own Qatar subjects; and you will also exercise Jurisdiction over all Moslem foreigners other than British subjects, including Moslem Companies* Cii) The Representative of the British Government will exercise jurisdiction over all British subjects, British protected persons and all Won-Moslem foreigners including Companies• Noter The expression 'British protected person' does not include subjects of the Shaikhs of Bahrain, Kuwait or the Trucial Coast States, who will, when in Qatar, come within the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Qatar, (iii) Disputes between persons or companies in category (i) above and persons or companies in category (ii) above will be settled by a Joint Court consisting of the Shaikh of Qatar and the Political Agent, or in minor cases the Shaikh of Qatar's representative and a representative of the Political Agent. This Court will sit at Dohah. 4, I would now request you, my friend, to write a letter to me confirming the correctness of the above statement in regard to the division of jurisdiction.

The issue of the above has been authorised. UuP.Z. 4953/38. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. (E 3968/1335/91) Jul 1938&gt; My dear Gribson, A / In reply to your letter P.Z.4508/38 of the 4th July enclosing a copy of an Express letter from Fowle reporting the result of the most recent approach to the Sheikh of | (sgatar in connexion with the Qatar Order-in—Council, I write to say that we see no objection to the terms of the^draft letter which it is proposed to address to the Sheikh. Tne position, however, is somewhat paradoxical and it may be worth while to set it out. At present the Sheikh of ^atar exercises jurisdiction over persons of every kind in his territory, de are now making arrangements with him under which we relieve him of his jurisdiction in respect of British subjects and British protected persons and other (non-Moslem) foreigners. He thus retains jurisdiction over his ownmtionals and Moslem foreigners and he now asks us for assurances that he will not get into trouble because he exercises jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners. The real answer to this is that if he is troubled about this we are quite willing to take over the jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners from him but he does not want this. It is perhaps for consideration whether we should in our letter add something to the effect that if he wishes we are willing to take over the jurisdiction over Moslem'foreigners. So far as the question which is worrying the Sheikh now is concerned, there is no practical difference between the two formulae i,e, whether we say as previously proposed nationals of a Moslem State or Moslem foreigners; virtually all Saudi Arabians come under it anyhow, but if Ibn Saud has a few Christian nationals then the new definition is narrower than the old one.

You will see that he quotes my letter to him (enclosure to Residency Express Letter No. C/350 dated the 20th June 193o) at some length, but stops before the words 'provided that you will deal with them and with their cases justly and fairly, and in doing so adhere strictly to the princinles of justice recognized in the law of Islam'. 3. e can regard his wording as being merely the formal method of referring to a letter received, without quoting the whole of its contents.

(2) A warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Resi dent shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named and to carry him to and deliver him up at the place named according to the warrant. 21.—(1) In cases of murder or culpable homicide, if either the death or the criminal act which wholly or partly caused the death happened in Qatar, a Court acting under this Order shall have the like jurisdiction over any person to whom this Order applies who is charged either as a principal offender or as an abettor as if both such criminal act and the death had happened in Qatar.

An error was detected;, unfortunately after the Order had 'been made, in Article 90 (2) relating to the place of sale of printed copies. The Order was drafted originally 'by the Government of India (Foreign &amp; Political Department letter of the 20th August, 1936, No.P.483-N/35) on the basis of the Koweit Order-in-Council and in the Article referred to 'Koweit' had survived undetected till now. We would have preferred to substitute here 'Bahrein or Qatar' in order to cover both present and possible future contingencies. We were, however, informed by the Privy Council Office that, while there would be no objection to our substituting in ink one word for 'Ko?/eit ,f , the substitution of three words would require an amending Order-in-Council, It was felt desirable to avoid this course if possible and we have therefore ' h.a .P.

Time is short, and as no apparent harm can be done by leaving these passages unamended, I do not think v.e need pursue t his matter in connexion .ith the Qatar Order. Other queries whict Eyres, nisq. , he/ foreign Office, S. W. 1.ov 11° he has raised are;- (i) Article 35 ( , 4l . Is British lav; a recognised expression? Does it mean an Act of Parliament? (ii) Article 74 (a) . What is the meaning of the last two lines of the first sab-paragraph? (I find that this Article dates from the Muscat Order-in-Council 1915 and was based on Muscat King^ Regulation No.l of 1903j the relevant words in which ran?- 'without due execution of signature and registration in His Britannic Majesty's Consulate at Muscat previous to the transfer of such property.' In the light of this I have suggested an alteration in the order of the jvords. (iii). Article 75 (l) . Is 'British Conpany' a term of art? Does it mean a Company registered in the United Kingdom? Perhaps you would be good enough to see whether any amendment is thought necessary in connexion with (i) and (iii). h.lrti 01 ) ' 4. I suggest^tfe^ opportunity might be taken to tidy up Article 4. Successive amendments of the model Article in the Persian Coast &amp; Islands Order have destroyed the original alphabetical order. Although it is unfortunate that we should have to repeal the Qatar Order so/3, so soon all the changes now -found necessary will he a guide in revising the Muscat Order-in-Council. 5. Il^ao^ ensure tau safety of the enclosed amended Order as I have not kept a duplicate of it. Yours sincerely, ^gd,) JL P, O^BSOK11' Note by Sir Vernon Dawson. The draftsman of this Order overloolced the following facts (1) That the expressions 'Governor-Generd in Council' and 'local Government' are now obsolete in Indian Acts and that throughout the Indian Statute Book Cenural a■overnillent ,, and 'Provincial Government' have respectively been substituted for them by paragraph 4(1) of the Government of India (Adaptation of Indian Laws) Orderj '1937^ These expressions are? further, defined by the General Clauses Act as amended by the Adaptation Order. (2) that the expressions 'enactments of the Governor- General of India in Council' and 'enactments of the Governor of Bombay in Council' are at least tv/enty years out of date; 'Indian Legislature' and 'Bombay Legislature' are now the appropriate substitutes; (3) that if, as is constantly done in the course of the Order, the Government of India are referred to as '^the Governor-General of India in Council', it will be necessary to amend that expression throughout the Order, and in all other similar Orders, as soon as i ^art II of the Government of India Act, 1935? comes into force. I have, therefore, suggested a definition of 'Governor- General' and the substitution of 'Governor- General' for 'Governor-General of India in Council' wherever it occurs throughout the Order as intended to describe the Executive Govennent in India; ik)/(ii) that the Act of 1935 rendered the expression 'Presidency cf Bombay' obsolete . Bombay, Bengal and Madras are now Provinces; and (5) the making of the Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order, 1937 (see paragraph 88(i) of this Order). 2. I have made the necessary corrections throughout the Order to give effect to these points, and have also posed other queries, drafting and otherwise, which I hope you will find intelligible; in particular I have queried the arrangement in several places in the Order which directs certain things to be done either by the Secretary of State or by the Government of India with his previous or subsequent approval. Is it really appropriate that any of these things shoild be done by the Secretary of State himself, and will he ever in fact do them ? Would not the obvious thing in all these places be to say that the things in question shall be done by the G-overnor-G-eneral ? ^ » 3. I strongly urge the omission of paragraph 3 of the Order. It is surely almost unprecedented to have an index to an Order in Council (which in this particular case seems quite otiose having regard to the fact that you already have the Part headings printed in large type in the appropriate places) inserted in the middle of an Order amongst its operative provisions.IKDIA OFFICE, ?.Z. 119/39.

The drafting amendments do not to call for camment, but you may lii-ce to comment on paragraph 5 o.t the foreign Office letter. Is it neceasaty to submit the Order in Council to the Shaikh of qatar for his formal approval ? He have his sanction for the exercise of authority in the exchange of letters with him (pp.l-a and 1-b), and the Order in Council is merely the instrument for exercising such authority. To secure his formal approval the whole K.R. would have to be translated. It would, only appear necessary to, approach the Shaikh if 'Moslem foreigner' is adopted in the definition of -qatar subject' instead of 'subject of a Muslim Foreign Power' used in the exchange of letters with the Shaikh (pp.l-a and 1-b), and to approach him on that point alone. Aa directed I nave looked jrp the procedure on tne introduction of the Kuwait Orders in Council,1925 and 1935, and the Bahrain ^rder in Council, 1913. In /j ; i W!' i i I III 1 lili ■Jill 111 illi In tne case of the Kuwait Order in Council, l92o, the Shaikh iBd not delegated to His Majesty 4 s Govern ment hia jurisdiction over foreigners oefore the Order in'Council was published. Before exhibition therefore the Shaikh was asked to delegate this jurisdiction. The Political Agent 1 s letter (Vol.D-114, p.167) set out for the Shaikh*s information only the Articles describ ing the classes of persons and things over which juris diction was exercised and the procedure in such cases and in cages in which Kuwait subjects were involved. Before the Kuwait Order in Council, 1935,was published we merely comRunicated to the Shaikh (Vol. in B-115, p»218) the alterations which/any way affected o him , and obtained his consent thereto (Vol.D-115,p«21® Before the Bahrain Order in Council was brought into force (in 1919) the Shaikh's prior approval theret was not sought. He was merely told that it was due to come into force, and certain features of it were explained to him (vide letter d/-19.2.19 from the Political Agent. In the case of Kuwait jurisdiction over foreigner had not been previously delega.ted by the Shaikh; in the cage of Bahrain there was some doubt as to the extent of the jurisdiction delegated (also some other contro versial points e.g. Khidma dues) so explanations of some sort were called for before the introduction of the Order in Council. In the case of Qatar, however, we have the delegation of authority in clear terms in th Shaikh 's letter, and as we are not exercising under the Order in Council any greater measure of juris diction than that delegated (except if we adopt the term 'Moslem foreigner') there seems no necessity to submit the whole Order in Council for his approval before it is brought into force. Ill ||&gt; To Shaikh (Town Vol. o 18/55-11, p.90). lr p rf 4n ||?.-R. (a) Neither the I.0» (p*7t&gt;) nor the F.O. (p.79) gave a reason for the exclusion; of Corporations from the Shaikh's jurisdiction but the reason is presumably that the Shaikh claimed jurisdiction only over Qatar .subject s and sub.lects of Moslem Powers (pp 1 a&amp;b) and if corporat ions were not excluded, tne definition would give the Shaikh wider jurisdiction than he asked for . The . difficulty has of course arisen from the change from 'national of any other Moslem State' in the earlier definition (page 62-a) to 'any Moslem person' (p.84) which, unless definitely excluded, includes a Corporation. •(b) 'Cases' here means 'disputes' in the sense used in ■ ■ paragraphs 2 and 3 of your letter No.c/114, dated 18/4/3t) (p.l-a) to the Shaikh as altered by the change from 'subjects of non-Moslem Foreign Powers' to 'any Moslem |)erson^'in the revised definition of Qatar subject. There would appear to be no need to amplify the explanation in paragraph 2 of that letter nor to quote the Acts applied. iW- o -s.
