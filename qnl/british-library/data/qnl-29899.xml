The latter was brought back to me by Hr. hosworth, but the fonner did not reach me until the 12th December. I consulted the Foreign Office about Your Highness* suggestion that the present treaty should be prolonged and they have agreed. It remains to be decided how the prolongation should be effected. ;he simplest method would be for you to write me a formal letter requesting the cancellation of your notice of termination dated the 1st February, 1950. If you wish, you could at the same time, send me a fresh notice of termination and this would have the effect of continuing the present Treaty tor one year from its date. Prolongation for a shorter period can only be effected by an exchange of no tea. If ^our Highness prefers the latter procedure I suggest that I shoulc x orwsrd drafts of the notes to be exchanged for your approval, in these circumstances, it would be possible to extend the Treaty either for a specified period, or for an indefinite period subject to, say, six months notice. I should be most grateful if Your Highness would kindly let ae know which method you prefer. If you choose the second one, would you kindly say whetlier you wish a specified period stated, and if so, wnat this period should he, or whether the extension may be for an indeUnite period subject to notice. I am arranging to send this letter by the ucyal Air Force mail and I should be grat^iul ii Your Highness, provided you see no objection, would kindly give your to the Officer Coi^uanding, R.A.F. at Salalah to be sent -.0 me by the same means.

Repeated for information Saving to U.K.N.C’s New Delhi. Karachi. Your telegram No. 414 of 2nd December: prolongation of Muscat Treaty. We concur. Continuation for one year would he preferable but we should be willing to consider six months if the Sultan insists. 2. Best means of effecting continuation for one year would be for the Sultan to request in v/riting the cancellation of his notice of termination. He could then at any time give fresh notixication Ox termination which would be effective twelve months later. This would also avoid raising again Pakistan’s claim to have inherited the rights of the pre-partition Government of India under the present Treaty. 3. Prolongation for a shorter period would have to be effected by exchange of notes(which we would draft) in which either the period would be stated or the Treaty would be extended for an indefinite period subject to say six month’s notice. It would in this case apply only to the United Kingdom and territories to which the Treaty has been extended under Article 19* This would not affect the exercise of jurisdiction over British subjects under Article 13 . 4. We agree that either you or Chauncy may if necessary go to Dhofar. Formal delegation of authority to Woods-Ballard would be required before he could sign on the Sultan’s behalf and a visit to the Sultan may therefore be unavoidable. 3, We think it unnecessary to consult the Government of India and, unless you see objection, propose now to inform Governments of India and Pakistan of the Sultan’s suggestion and of action we are taxing.37433—5 WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY / V/ •« BRITISH RESIDENCY, BAHREIN, PERSIAN GULF. 1^(89/24/50) U I'TCL AS Z IF IrIP British .-iesiaency, Bahrain- 2nd De ce mber, 1950 I have received a letter from tlie 5ultan of til sc at in which he says that he will let me know about his return towards the end of December and I gather from what follows that tliis is to be read literally and does not mean that he expects to return at the end of December.

Mr. Bosworth arrived at the aerodrome last night and he will be leaving this morning at 9 a.m. with Dr. Thoms and his family. It appears that Your Excellency has not received my letter of November 2nd in which I mentioned about my return to Muscat. That letter was in reply to your letter dated the 27th September which I received on the 17th October when Sir Cyril Fox came here. In my letter I said that I shall let you know about my return towards the end of December and that I would suggest tnat the Old Treaty may be prolonged for some time as it seems unlikely that we will be able tonegotiate the New Treaty before the expiry of the old one. I hope this will be agreeable. However if I find that I am able to let you know about my return before the end of December then I shall inform irrmflediately or otherwise. Yes, the newspapers sometimes write something which has no foundation and so the radio broadcasts and I thank you for mentioning the matter. I am very glad to know that you and your family are — well and that you are expecting your youngest daughter out for Christmas. Kindly give them my compliments.

A14 2nd December repeated for information to uscat and Savings United Kingdom High Commissioner’s Karachi and pew Delhi. I have received a letter from Sultan by hand of Bosvrorth who has just returned from a flight to Salalah saying that he will let me know when he will be returning towards the end of December. fh at ^ # , TT e suggests that; ,r /\old Treaty may be prolonged for some time as it seems unlikely that we will be able to negotiate new Treaty before expiry of old one ', but makes no mention of any specific period. Nor does he say whether prolongation is to be effective in respect of India (and Pakistan ?) as well as United 'ingdom. 2. In the circumstances it seems v/e s’ all have to agree to prolongation of Treaty to which I can see no objection irom our point of view. x elegraph if you concur. If so we might suggest eriod should be for ( mut ? one ? year ) but be willing to accept six months and also, if Government of India agree, that prolongation should be held to apply to India as well as to United ’ingdom. I would suggest we should make no mention of Pakistan to Sultan as he will not admit that Treaty covers that country and that v/e should not consult Government of Pakistan but if existing Treaty is prolonged (?inform them)accordingly. 3. I fear v/e must wait until end of December to learn how long Sultan proposes to remain in Dhofar. If he does not propose to return before 11th February it ry be necessary for Chauncy or- myself to visit Dhofar to negotiate prolongation of existing Treaty or to persuade him to give V/oods-Balland authority to sign necessary do cument. I am not ... sure whethersure whether a separate agreement ( met ) treaty vr5.ll he necessary or whether it will suffice if Sultan can he persuad d to cancel his notice of termination ai^.d issue a fresh one if he so desires and I should he gretaful for instructions on t is point. Original notice which was signed hy him personally was forwarded under my des atch Ho, 19 of the 22nd February 1950. i’Urgent &amp; Confidential* 31/8/65/30. H.B.M's Consulate and Political Agency, MUSCAT. 4th December, 1950. Yj dear Sir ’ upert, I have suggested elsewhere that we should stick to what I understood was to be the original plan of a) a Consular Convention, and b) a Ccranercial Treaty. 2 . I have discussed the matter generally with Woods-Ballard on more than one occasion, and he is as convinced as I am that this is by far the best approach to the Sultan, and will receive his most ready response and friendliest reaction. If it is desired to make reservations about jurisdiction over our nationals (and I new think we should), this can be treated as a separate issue and be disposed of by the exchange of letters. 3. As regards the Consular Convention I believe that the Sultan wouldAwithout hesitation or revision a draft which contained the same provisions as the 1949 Convention agreed to between the Uinited States of America and the United Kingdom. , on the ground that what was good enough for them and their lawyers would be good enough for him. Any other draft, he would go through with a fine tooth conb, and be scared stiff of ulterior motives and hidden meanings for, as he has so often said, he has no legal department or the like, but is just one person ranged against all the facilities available to the other party. 4. The same will apply to the Commercial Treaty - any draft on the lines of that with some other nation would do, or if none is suitable, freed of references to jurisdiction and representation, and confined to most favoured nation treatment, and/or treatment not less favourable than that enjoyed by his own subjects, the Sultan would find little to worry him. 5 # Then, thirdly, the question of extra territorial rights would, as suggested, be settled by verbal discussion and confirmed by the exchange of letters at the time of the signature of the two formal documents. 6 . This the Sultan would find far more palatable and in keeping with his dignity, and muoh less likely to emba/ass him in similar negotiations with other states, in particular India and Pakistan, if they should also try for the exercise of jurisdiction over their nationals in the Sultanate, which I believe he is deter mined to resist. In fact even in our case I think he will only wish to compromise on this point over Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Pven from our side, such discrimination would be difficult to provide for except by letter. 7. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. BAHRAIN.y y ■2 7. If we attempt a single omnibus agreement I am certain that we shall never get it through, if we succeed at all, without endless haggling, and, almost certainly, with less advantage to ourselves. I have mentioned the Consular Convention between the 8 . United States of America and the United Kingdom because I have a copy of no others, but in any case it is this one which would be likely to appeal most to the Sultan, for the very fact that it is completed with so /great a power, with whom, he knows, we are on the least reserved terms, laoreover it provides for all that we require (apart from extra territoriality) in detail and free from ambiguity. With an agreement on the lines of our present treaty the &gt;Muscat Government enjoy the same rights in the United Kingdom (if they could use them), under the most favoured nation stipulation, as the United States of America*, whilst we get in Muscat territory not ing specific as there is nctyother nation at present enjoying such rights. 9 * I feel so strongly about this that I will, if required, gladly attempt to elaborate further, but I do not wish to weary you if I have already made the point and you find yourself able to commend these suggestions to His Majesty's Government.

We are proposing to prepare a draft very much on the lines of the present Treaty, as suggested in Sir Rupert Hay’s despatch No. 11 of the 2nd February.

Y/e should, however, be glad if you would let us know urgently whether you have any indication that the Sultan is likely to object to any of the provisions of the present Treaty. The point v/hich we have in mind is that many provisions of the present Treaty are of a unilateral nature ana it is possible that some reciprocity may be asked for by the Sultan.

L. ^hauncy, British Consul, Muscat• WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCYBritish Residency, Bahrain. (437/2/50) ;0N?I )ENTIAL 14th June, 1930. In my despatch No.11 2/30) of the 2nd February about the proposed now treaty with Muscat I stated that the aain bone of contention was likely to be that of extra-territorial jurisdiction and said that although the Sultan .light be will ing to agree to our retaining jurisdiction over British European subjects he would certainly wish to exercise juris diction over all Asiatics. I now enclose a report received from Ghauncy from which it will be seen that the Sultan is anxious to obtain the abolition of all extra-territorial jurisdiction. He states that he was offered this in 1937. I am, unable to obtain any confirmation of this and it a pears that from the outset of the negotiations of the 1939 Treaty we acted on the presumption that we could not agree to surrender extra-territorial jurisdiction, c.f. oara 3 of telegram Ho.868 of the 27th August, 1937 from the iolitical Resident to the Secretary of otate for India. You will no doubt be letting us have instructions on this subject in due course. My own view ie that to begin with we should endeavour to retain extra-territorial rights in respect of all British subjects, though we may find it desirable to give way on the point at a later stage possibly in return for some kind of quid pro quo. As the Sultan remarks, there are only a hand ful of British Europeans in Muscat. There is no early prospect of their number being substantially increased and so far as I am aware no British European subject has been involved in litigation in luscat, at any rate for a number of years. The cases with which the Political Agent has dealt have concerned Indians and jrakistanis almost exclusively. 2. You will see that the Sultan has raised the question of the nationality of the Ahojas. This has already been dis cussed vide correspondence ending with Eastern department letter S 6204/1601/91 the 7th June, 1949* I think the Khojas in Muscat, iatrah and elsewhere and the Agakhanis in Gwadur will, when the time comes elect to remain British subjects. It will then be for the Sultan, if he so wishes, to enact some kind of nationality law which will either auto matically make them Muscat subjects or place them under grave disabilities if they do not adopt Muscat nationality. It is not, however, for us to suggest this to him in the first place though if he asks for our advice about the framing of a nationality law we should be willing to give it. 3.

Reference to previous correspondence: Description of Enclosure.matPERSIAH GULF KSSIDKtfCX 2m February, I960* i.s I have already reported the Sultan intends to give notice of the termination of the Treaty of Cosraerce and Navigation of 1939 by the 6th February, 1960 as provided for in Article 23 as a result of which the Treaty will automati cally expire on the 6th February, 1961. During one of my interviews with him at fuscat I asked him whether he proposed to make any suggestions about a new treaty with His 'ajesty’s Government. He replied that after the 5th February. 1961 there would be no treaty and that if His Majesty's Government wanted one he expected them to make proposals accordingly, he said that when the 1939 treaty was negotiated it was a question of revising an existing treaty and that he had therefore state at his requirements first. In the present case if His Majesty*s Government wanted a treaty with him it was for them to make their own proposals. I told hi® that so far as I was aware His Majesty’s Government were satisfied with the existing treaty and that if the Sultan were not satisfied with it, as his wish to terminate it indicated, I considered that it was rather for him to suggest the lines on which any changes might follow. I had already told him that I was discussing the matter with him without instruc tions and did not argue the matter further. 2. I should be grateful for Instructions whether the Sultan's attitude in the matter should be accepted. I am inclined to think myself that it would be safer for us to make our own proposals as otherwise we may be faced from the beginning with extravagant and ill-conceived demands, and that we might well press for something on the lines of tne present treaty with all references to India oamitted. The Sultan is 1eating for Dhofar in the middle of February and expects to be back in Muscat in the autumn. I would suggest that if my proposal is approved we should have a draft treaty ready for discussion with him when he returns. The main bone of contention is likely to be that of extra-territorial jurisdiction. The Sul tan may be willing to agree to our retaining Jurisdiction over European British subjects, but he will certainly wish to exer cise jurisdiction himself over all Asiatics. There are at present 209 members of the Khoja community registered with us as either British Protected Persons or British Subjects by birth who have opted neither for India or Pakistan and are likely to wish to remain British Subjects. All or most of the other Asiatics who are registered with us, totalling 481, will probably become either Indian or Pakistani subjects. 3. As indicated in my despatch No.9 of the 28th January the Sultan appears to be ready to negotiate a new treaty with india. He is not anxious for a treaty with Pakistan as he is afraid _ „j that the question of Cwadur will be raised and will take no ac tion until a definite approach is made to him. 4.

Normally changes of the constitution of a State brought about by normal peace ful means do not affect its Treaty rights and obligations.
