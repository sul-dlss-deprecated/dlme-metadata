EEVIEW BT THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PEESIAJST GULF. EXPLANATORY NOTE. The creation during the last few years of several additional and important posts within the sphere of the Persian Gulf Eesidency has gradually made the material for annual report too unwieldy to he conveniently dealt with as hitherto, in a single compilation by the Eesident. Accordingly, under the instructions of the Government of India, the Trade Statistics have been separated and the Political Beport for the past twelvemonths is this vear presented m a revised form. Separate reports for their respective charges have been furnished by the following officers of the Government of India, and will now be reviewed 1 PERSIA. BuBhire and Fars Arabistan , Kermanshah .

This disturbance of the balance of power is likely to have an important effect on the political situation in Arabia, which is pregnant with possibilities. The remaining salient themes of general interest are more profitable to treat of, and include the following: The meeting of the Hague Tribunal in August 1905 for the adjudication of the Trench Flag case, and the delivery French Flag. by them of an award which bas fully vindicated our attitude towards the policy of the Trench Government in regard to the grant of their flag to Arab dhows, and which, if legally interpreted, will give His Highness the Sultan and ourselves all that we could reasonably expect to achieve from the International Court.

This Syndicate having for the time being on Concession. relinquished their borings near Kasr-i- Shirin under Kermanshah, transferred their chief attention to Southern Arabistan, and with the assistance of Mr. R.

It would be premature at present to hazard any prognostications as to the probable future of this concession; suffice to say at present that the promoters are taking all possible measures to push their work forward. In order that Government might have expert information in regard to the features of the scheme recommended The Karun Irrigation Scheme. ^ ^ r B)0ggeIlj Dutch Engineer, who, as mentioned in last year's Report, had been commissioned to explore the tract on behalf of the Persian Government, the Government of India deputed Major W.

A panic was for some time created by one of His Majesty's ships which was on special duty for several weeks, cruising between Maskat and Mekran, and towards the close of the year Captain P. McOotiaghey, Assistant Political Agent at Panjgur, was specially deputed to travel through the districts interested in the smuggling and to make a thorough investigation of the ramifications of the trade ; as well as to confer with a Persian official appointed for the purpose as to the measures which might be possible to put it down. Mr. R.

So far as business relations between the Residency and the personnel of i—Bushire „ , the Customs Administration are con- and Fars ' Customs. i j.1 i i i ii cerned, the year has been marked by an entire absence of friction, probably resulting in part from the salutary example furnished by the sudden translation, at the end of last year of a troublesome Director, Monsieur E. Waffelaert, but also due to the friendly and reasonable attitude of the present incumbent, Monsieur J. Heynssens. The Belgian Administration, however, is still intensely unpopular, as a whole, with the peasant and sea-faring population of the Gulf littoral both Arab and Persian; and, on the other hand, the result of the high tariff and rigid enforcement of regulations has given an enormous impetus to smuggling and has largely increased the difficulties of the B/esident in dealing with the Trucial and other allied Chiefs on the Arab shore. Nothing is likely to cure this state of things, short of a return to an all- ronnd 5 per cent. duty. Both the precise nature and limits of our occupancy of the Cable Station at Hen jam, and the status of the Beni en;iam ' Yas Arab tribesmen domiciled on the Islands were a source of much local difficulty and of troublesome negotiation at Tehran, and are still not finally determined. Progress has certainly been made in regard to the settlement of outstand- _ . * ™ . ing claims, thanks to the unremitting SetUement of Claims. 0 ,. 5 „ TT .. tit • i. &gt; ^ exertions of His Majesty's Charge d*Affaires; but certain of those which have been the most fruitful.source of worry, the Persian Government still persistently neglects to settle. Chief among these latter is the case of the murder of Abu Thabi subjects by inhabitants of Taona, for which compensation has been vainly demanded and in regard to which the long delay in settlement has had a most prejudicial effect on the attitude of Sheikh Zaeed bin Khalifah, in his dealings with the Besidency. In the commercial case of Dixon and Company versus Haji Nasir for sums due on accepted bills; it is a matter for much regret, and likely to have a discouraging effect on British trading enterprise in Persia (which is mostly on the long credit system) that His Majesty's Legation has been compelled to airive at the unpleasant conclusion that under the present conditions of Government in Persia, the universal commercial principle providing that 'accepted bills must be met without question' cannot be regarded as an axiom of commerce in this country, and that British traders should conse quently exercise caution in choosing their constituents and in giving credit. Ihis subject and the anarchical conditions prevailing in Shiraz have been dealt with elsewhere. But for the tact ful and resolute attitude maintained by Mr. Consul Grahame towards the rioters through several anxious months excesses would in all probability have been resorted to in which all foreigners alike would have been in.grave danger. b 2 /4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL II.—Arabistan.

It will be seen frorn the accompanying sketch map showing approximate territorial boundaries, that the field covered by his touring commission is a very extensive one, and offers a wide horizon to the energies of a young and strenuous officer.

The chief items in the year's history have been the rebellion of the Beni Truf Arabs occupying part of the Beni Truf Eebeiiion.

These dissensions enhanced the already existing difficulties in connection with the upkeep of the Lynch Road, and the incep tion of the operations of the D'Arcy Oil Concession Syndicate. I need do no more than allude to these two subjects, which are fully dealt with in Captain Lorimer's Report. I may mention, however, ^hat Major W. R. Morton, R.E., who, as before Major Morton's work. mentioned, was on special duty in ^ a Arabistan throughout the year in connec tion with the Karun Irrigation Scheme, and acted as Vice-Consul for the hot weather of 1905 during Captain Lorimer's absence on leave, in August made a tour up the Lynch Road, furnishing a report on its condition on his return. It is evident from the terms of it that the primary desideratum is the maintenance of a permanent working party on the road. No progress was possible in connection with the opening of the Dizfal- Dizfui-Khorremabad Caravan Route.

A. K. Qousrh, on its iDauguration of Conauiate. ascertained that the Russian represent tive enjoyed full Consular rank. The appointment must be regarded, from tlie point of view of surroundings, as the most desirable in Persia among'those manned by officers of the Government of India. ^ The place itself is peculiarly favoured by nature; has an almost European climate and is the centre of a rich grain-prodncing district as well as the focus for incoming and outgoing caravan trade via Baghdad. Our representative is additionally fortunate in the fact that the liberality of the Government of India has made it possible for us to secure on his recommendation, for the location of the British Consulate, the most desirable residential site in Kermanshah, advantageously situated as it is in a fine garden and orchard. Kermanshah is a spot which must continue to increase in importance as communications improve and civilisation advances, and it is satisfactory to know that a site has been acquired which under any future conditions of expansion, must always remain a central and commanding one. The Consular sphere of the post includes the provinces of Kermanshah, Hamadan, Kurdistan and Malayar, among which Kermanshah is the most important from the point of view of our interests. Politically, what work there is at present is connected chiefly with the country to the north of Kermanshah, and appertains to His Majesty's Legation rather than the Bushire Hesidency or the Government of India. The latter's T , x interest lies in the fact that Kermanshah Indian interests. oc i i i. £ j . « anords a market or great promise for British and British Indian goods imported via the Persian Gulf and Baghdad. The town furthermore lies on the great highway for the passage of pilgrims from northern and western Persia to the holy cities of Kerbela and Nejef and swarms of these devoted travellers pass up and down the road during the year in number often exceeding 10,000 souls. The local politics of the neighbourhood having, as before stated, little interest for the Government of India, it follows that reports received from the Consulate do not afford much material for a political review and the contents of Captain Gough's report are necessarily in a great measure fiscal and commercial. When the appointments at Ahwaz and Kermanshah were first instituted, n „ . 0 it was contemplated that one tourins urgeon. commissioned medical officer of the Indian Medical Service would be able to administer to the needs of both Consulates, but owing to the disturbed state of the intervening country and difficulty of communication, this is likely to prove impossible. Meanwhile the Surgeon has had his head-quarters at Kermanshah. Captain T. S. Beauchamp Williams, I.M.S., the officer appointed, having spent the spring of 1905 in company with His Eoyal Highness the Ferman Perma in his so-called operations against the Dirakwand, returned to head-quarters in May 1905 and soon afterwards proceeded on short leave. Just before the close of the year, the Perman Perma was himself transferred to Kerman as Governor-General. Captain Gough's observations as to the necessity and profitability of improv- improvement of main road. ing the rrjad between Kermanshah and Kasr-i-Shinn are deserving ol attention. The Government of this important province, as well as our own represen- Frequent changes. tation within it, has been considerably handic'apped during the year by frequent changes of personnel. Thus in the former case no less than four distinguished subjects of His Majesty the Shah have dispensed the amenities of adminstra- tion to the unfortunate inhabitants of the province; His Highness the Eukn- ed-T)owleh ; His Highness Zafar-es-Sultaneh ; the Adihes-Sultamh; and finally, just at the close of the year His Royal Highness the Perman Perma. IV.—Eerman.EESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 7 Similary, in our Consulate, Major P. Molesworth Sykes, C.M.G., who created the post in 1894 and with some intervals of leave, had ever since then ably maintained British interest and prestige within his sphere, was translated to Mesbed in the spring of 1905 and was relieved by Captain L. B. Haworth in May. The latter again, after six months' residence, and just as he had acquired a satisfactory grip of the work, had to return to India in November, and was in turn relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. M. Stewart, who remained until the end of the year. Under such changing conditions the period reviewed could hardly provide a record of a very progressive nature. Captain Haworth, however, during his few months' connection with the Consulate, applied himself zealously to Scheme for road-guards. ^ i m p 0r tant question of providing a greater measure of security for the Bunder Abbas-Kerman caravan route and before leaving evolved a scheme for the provision of the road-guards, which had the prima facie approval of the Government of India and was subject to the consideration of His Majesty's Government at the end of the year. Another prudent and important measure was the inauguration at the instance of the Government of India of a Inauguration of a Vice-Cousulate at Bam. Vice-Consulate at Bam, which had for its objects the advance of our trading and political interests in the neighbourhood of this important stage on the Bunder Abbas-Kerman strategical line; and the planning of, or co-operation in, measures for the suppression of lawlessness on the caravan routes. The first incumbent of the post was an Indian Muhammadan, Khan Bahadur Ashgar Ali, originally an employe of the Government of India Survey, who had originally come to Persia some years before with Mr. Tate of that Departmentf and having after the conclusion of the latter's mission remained on duty with Major Sykes, had been doing useful work under that officer's orders and had gained in the process an intimate knowledge of the country, language and people which was considered to render him deserving and qualified for permanent employment under the Eoreign Department. He joined his appointment in June after accompanying the Newcomen Commercial Mission throughout their Death of Vice-Consui. four; but was unfortunately not destined to retain it long, as he died of pneumonia or pleurisy on the 11th October 1905. His place was not immediately filled, but just before the end ol: the year the appointment of a young British Appointment of Lieutenant g vie. officer as an experimental measure was intimated by the Government of India; and Lieutenant G. D. Ogilvie, the officer appointed, shortly afterwards left Quetta for his post overland. Kerman itself was in a state of chronic ferment for the first eight or nine , months of the year owing to semi-religious dissensions between the Sheikhi and Balasiri sections of the populace. These for a long time flourished unchecked owing to the absence of permanent authority, but were eventually extinguished by rigorous action on the part of His Highness Zafar-es-Sultaneh against the fanatical clergy, who were the main instigators of the disorder. Colonel Stewart considers that His Highness's action and its effective result demonstrate, firstly, that the Kermanis are not fanatically inclined, and, secondly, that the tiresome practice of taking ^bast' or sanctuary can on occasion be set aside by a strong man without exciting an outburst of popular indignation. Apart from the above, the only other event deserving of special notice, „ . .,. was the visit of the Armenian ' Prince ' EusaiauCommt-rciaiMission. Anatovmi of the llussiaa Department o£ Commerce ; a protege of the Grand Puke Michael, who has made two lengthv tours in Persia with the object of finding openings for Hussian goods and enterprise.8 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET ON THE PEESIAN GULP POLITICAL —Bunder )bas. Cable connection and dispute Government. with the Persian His present visit was doubtless intended as a set off to that of the Newcomen Commercial Mission, but so far as is known the Prince did not have much success. On the other hand it is disappointing to have to report that the institu- „ .., a , „ tion of the Sample Room at Kerman for n is amp e com. ^ display of patterns of British goods has hitherto proved altogether abortiye. A Government of India officer was appointed to Bunder Abbas in 1900 as Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and ex-officio Vice- Consul for His Majesty's Foreign Office. In 1904 it was considered advisable to raise his consular status to that of Consul with an extended jurisdiction. Since then, however, owing to quarantine difficulties and to the want of adequate facilities for visiting the outlying portions of his charge our representative has been unable to extend his practical attention further south east than Minab and the field covered by his present report is consequently curtailed to that extent. The two most prominent incidents recorded during the year have been the linking up of Bunder Abbas with the Telegram Cable system of the Gulf and a long and troublesome dispute with the Persian Government in connection therewith. Our difficulties were, it is believed, mainly due to the sinister influence and advice of the newly appointed Russian Consul, Monsieur Ovseenko, who in February 1906 arrived in Bunder Abbas from Meshed and Kerman with a considerable flourish of trumpets to inaugurate the Russian Consulate there; Russian interests having previously been in the hands of a Persian subject, the Sadeed-es-Sultaneh, formerly Karguzar of Bushire and well known as an astute but unscrupulous intriguer. I need do no more than make brief mention of this protracted dispute as the details are fully set forth in Lieutenant Shakespear's report. Another tiresome correspondence with the Persian Government in connec- Hei) . ain tion with our telegraph station at Henjam has been dealt with under Bushire, as, owing to its frequently urgent nature, it necessarily fell to the Resident to deal with it direct. The Bunder Abbas-Kerman caravan route continued to be insecure The insecurity of trade route. throughout the year, and, spite of repeated assurances given by the Central Government to His Majesty's Legation, all sorts of illegal imposts which niegai imposts. should have been absolutely suppressed on the introduction of the new Customs Tariff under the Convention of 1903 were persistently levied by the local authorities on the ground that they had been taken into account in the Annual Revenue Schedule formulated by the Central Government. It is hoped that ere long the constant representations and protests of the Ecsidency and His Majesty's Legation will result in their final abolition. iv.— Persian This tract is the Ultima Thule of the Shah's territory, and inhabited as Mekran Coast. ^ is ^ an race stron g Bedouin instincts and a rooted antipathy to its Persian overlords, it is hardly surprising that the administrative control exercised over it by the Central Government is of the slenderest character ; and in the result the poverty-stricken country, often racked as it is from year to year with the miseries of famine, becomes a cockpit of petty inter-tribal dissension and rapine, based usually on the rivalries of the petty ' Mirs' who are incessantly struggling for mastery one over the other. As far as the Telegraph line is concerned, however, the year has been a Safety of the Telegraph line. quiet one and no damage has been done to the wire. The fact is no doubt that these courtly bush-rangers, the ' Mirs,'* the chief among whom are subsidised by the Telegraph Department for obliging their adherents to respect the sanctity of the wire, place considerable value on their modest but regularRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 9 salaries and as a rule are anxious to keep in the good books of the British authorities as far as their predatory habits allow them. The two most serious questions connected with Persian Mekran at present Traffic in Arn.. .nd k .™ f 6 ' ^ t « de m contraband arms irom Maskat, and, secondly, the prevalence of the slave traffic among the people themselves. The Persian Government seem to be impotent as well as disinclined to take any effective steps to cope with either of these evils, and the result is that it is left to the Government of India and its officers to take such measures as they can for their suppression or mitigation, in the former case in their own interests, and in the latter, in the cause of humanity. The traffic in arms by gangs of Afghans and frontier tribesmen, which has been so brisk for the last three years, must be regarded rather as a recrudescence than as any new departure of the industry. Considerable numbers of Afghans used to visit Maskat in similar gangs ten years ago, but it is probable that at that time their modus operandi was not so deliberate and well organised as it is now, and the seizure of the S.S. Baluchistan cargo by H.M.8. Lapwing in 1899 seems to have caused a panic among these gentry, which for two or three years kept them away. During the last three years, however, they have been gradually resuming their opera tions and these have been much facilitated by the appearance in Maskat of Prench and Russian merchants who have embarked largely on this trade in arms and whose operations are the bolder in that they do not labour under the restrictions which are imposed upon British subjects in regard to the sale of arms in Maskat territory. In the suppression of this traffic, which is of much importance to the Government of India, the Persian Government have undertaken to co-operate, and in pursuance of the arrangement Captain P. McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent at Panjgur, was deputed on special duty in March 1906 to meet a Persian representative, and in consultation with him to devise measures for the concerted action against the smugglers. Metr.nisi.yc Traffic. ^ The question of the M elf rani slave tramc has been dealt with sufficiently in the body of the report. In April 1905 a joint meeting was convened at Charhar for the settlement of charbar meetings. tlie claim ? bot h the Telegraph Depart- ment and Mekran Coast Ports as well as of ihe Kalat Agency against Persian subjects. The Persian Government was represented by the Governor of Bampur and the Government of India by the Nazim of Mekran. About half a lakh of outstandings were found to exist and claims to the value of some Rs. 20,000 were subsequently settled. Again in the spring of 1906 the two meetings were combined and a joint Court held at Charbar at which Captain McConaghey, on deputation in connection with the arms traffic, was able to be present. As far as the labours of the Committee were concerned, the work done was eminently satisfactory, but it remains to be seen how far the Persian Government will insist on the execution of the Awards given. The chief event of the year was the delivery, on the 8th Ammst 1906, vtt _ m qc w French Flag Case. of the Award of the Tribunal assembled . . J , at permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague m virtue of the compromise between Great Britain and Prance on 13th October 1904 for the settlement of the French Plag question. It is not necessary to go into the details of the Award here, as the Political Agent has dealt with them fully; suffice it to say that on the whole they were considered satisfactory both to the Sultan and ourselves. In fact according to the evidence obtained by the Political Agent it would not appear that more than 14 owners and 18 dhows satisfy the conditions entitling them to fly the flag. b It is probable, however, that the exigencies of general politics and the entente cordiale with France wdll prompt His Majesty's Government to advise o10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THI5 PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL His Highness to defer, in reference to one or two details of the Award, to the keen desire of the Prench to save their amour prop re, His Majesty's Secretary of State considering that he can afford to do so in view of the fact that the practice will automatically cease to exist with the death of the present owners The negotiations preparatory to the promulgation of the Award to His Highness's subjects were in progress when the year closed, and seemed likely to endure for some little time longer. The usual intertribal difficulties and petty rebellions against the Sultan 's Oman Tribal Politics. authority ha ve been prevalent during the year, especially m the part of Oman which is most favoured by nature and should accordingly be most prosperous under a settled Government. In all serious difficulties of this kind His Highness seems to turn to his veteran campaigner Suleiman bin Swail'm, who is never so hapnv as when undertaking wa'like expeditions for his master, which prove no doubt a source of income to him, as well as an enhancement of his personal prestige. As usual the Sultan's finances have been going from bad to worse and The Sultan', ta .aoe.. during- this year he has faileu out with his Indian Customs Superintendent Muham mad Ibrahim oPwhom he would until recently not hear a word of dispara^e- ment, and in whom as he told His Excellency the Viceroy at his interview^t Mask at, when advised to appoint an auditor, that he had every confidence. This official was on the whole a capable administrator and with any supervision at all would have served His Highness well, but as Sir Seyyid Eeisal took little intelligent interest in his accounts beyond seeing that his Customs Superinten- dent-and-Banker produced money from somewhere whenever wanted, any ether result than that which ensued was not to be expected. The Maskat public have at all events to thank Muhammad Ibrahim's incumbency for a mucli improved set of Customs buildings and wharf accom modation which they would have waited many years for under a Banian Customs regime. The latter community have npw been able to insert the thin end of the wedge in the person of Damodar Dharamsee, a former Customs farmer and now pro forma, I fear, a paid supervisor, but it is to be hoped that the early settlement of the Erench Flag question will make it possible for us to take up the problem of the Sultan's finances and indebtedness on business lines, as well as several other important topics of which discussion with His Highness has been postponed until the settlement of the above question has made the atmosphere clearer. Among these I may include the Currency question, regarding which the British Indian community made earliest representations on the occasion of the Viceroy's visit; the renewal of out Commercial Treaty with Maskat, the period of which has expired; the better administration of the Soor Customs; and the introduction of a British Bank into Maskat. It is interesting to note that of the total number of slaves released in siave Trade. Maskat during the year, which in the , * aggregate runs about the average, or a little short of it, less than half were African, the remainder being Mekranis. An event which may prove to be a far reaching one and which, therefore, The Sponge Exploration Syndicate. deserves record was the success of Monsieur Hatinoglou, the Greek representative of the ' Sponge Exploration Syndicate', in obtaining from the Sultan, in Novem ber 1905, a concession for Sponge fishing with modern appliances on the Oman Coast a concession to which His Highness seems to have committed himself somewhat incautiously.

The salient event of the year was the threatened visit of Bin Saood; Overtures from Bin Saood. th f details regarding which are fully dealt with in the body of the report. The Wahabi's attention would naturally turn in the direction of Oman if he were confident of his position in Nejd, but at the time of his overtures to the Trueial Sheikhs he could not have been by any means assured on that score, and it is probable that his suggestion was a ballon d'essai sent up to show the direction of the wind, or to induce financial support from the Sheikhs. The overture was, however, enough to disturb the equilibrium of Sheikh Zaeed bin Kalifah, the Hinawi leader on the Trucial Coast and always the least tractable of the Chiefs, and to give him a handle for parading his old hobbies, such as the colonisation of Zora and the re-occupation of Odaid. The politics of the hinterland have been chiefly remarkable for the iii-feeiing between Abu Tbabi and Umm-ai- obstinate quarrel between the Sheikh of Kawai^ • Umm-al-Kawain and Sheikh Zaeed of Abu Thabi in connection with the latter's relations with the Bedouin tribe of Beni Katab. In connection with this quarrel an interesting written agreement was arrived at between Sheikh Zaeed and Sheikh Rashid just after the close of the year, and whether or no this is likely to have a long life it is in itself of considerable interest. In it the tribal spheres of interest of the two Sheikhs are defined and it is noted that those recorded as under the protective influ ence of Sheikh Zaeed, are, among others— (1) Sheikh Hamad bin Abdulla of Pujeira (subject of Shargah). (2) Mahomed bin Sulaiman of Dereez (subject of the Sultan of Maskat). (3) Sultan bin Mahomed Naeemi (Independent). (4) The Shihiyeen (or Shihuh) of Roos-al-Jabal (subjects of the Sultan of Maskat). Sheikh Zaeed no doubt assumes protection over Nos. 2 and 4 in view of his alliance with the Sultan of Maskat, but his doing so is certainly an evidence of the exiguity of His Highness's practical authority in the Dhahireh and Roos-al-Jabal. The Trucial Sheikhs, especially Sheikh Zaeed, are not rendered easier to Belgian Customs Admioietratiou. deal With by the Strict enforcement of regulations against them by the Belgian Customs regime. Even if the Customs are in the right—and they often are—it is extremely difficult to explain matters to the Sheikhs, and when hasty action is taken, as it frequently is by their subordinates at petty ports, it is a process of time and difficulty to obtain relief. This, however, must be regarded as a permanent difficulty, as nothing but the education of the Arabs up to civilised methods of administration and justice will eliminate it. The Resident visited Baraimi in December after a lapse of five years Resident's tonra an ^ noticed a considerable extension of _ Sheikh Zaeed's domination in the oasis, entirely enveloping the Dhowabir and extending now even to the Naeem, the chief Ghafiri element, whose Sheikhs are indeed of no personality and could no doubt be absorbed at once, but Sheikh Zaoed's policy is evidently one of pacific absorption, in which he has certainly had a considerable measure of success, and though impatient himself of advice or control, it must be admitted that his influence among those whom he controls is on the side of law and order so long as it is compatible with his own undisputed supremacy. This Sheikh still continues to make the non-settlement of the Taona Taonacase&lt; murder case by the Persian Government a subject of grievance, and owing to the chaotic state of the Administration at present there seems no likelihood of that grievance being removed by a satisfactory settlement of the case. c a12 ADMINISTRATION EE POET ON THE PERSIAN GtJLE POLITICAL IX —Bahrein. The position in Bahrein is still one of considerable difficulty. As was anticipated in last year's report Sheikh '' Ali bin Ahmed, the Sheikh's troublesome nephew, who absconded to escape arrest on the presentation of the Govern ment of India's ultimatum to Sheikh Esa, soon got tired of Bedouin life in Katar and surrendered himself to the Political Agent on the 18th July. He was in due course deported in H.M.S. Sphinx to Bombay where he now resides on an allowance of E600 per mensem. Prom a local point of view it would have been convenient if the Customs Cugtomg of Manama could have been assumed as a part of the operations sanctioned for the bringing of the Sheikh to his bearings ; but it was thought that the lesson given him would have resulted in his being more tractable in future and in his accepting the advice of Government in regard to this important matter among others. Such has not been the case, however, and he still shows a most determined resolve not to be induced even by the most profitable offers to place his administration on more civilised lines, although confronted by a large increase in the volume of Bahrein trade, from which under present system he derives no personal advantage. In October 1905 Sheikh Esa, tutored no doubt by some intriguer, probably ct, m v. i. &gt; •,. « + Monsieur Goguyer of Maskat, who had Sheikh Esa's memorial to Government. -tii i . t,i . \ , lately been at Bahrein, addressed a memorial to His Excellency the Viceroy and His Majesty's Secretary of State for India through Messrs. Kynoch &amp; Co., the Small Arms dealers of Birmingham, who are among the Eirms participating in the arms traffic to the Gulf. In this document he set forth a number of grievances complain ing specially of the appointment by the Government of India of a British Officer to represent them at Bahrein; of being debarred from participation in the profits of the arms traffic ; and of other alleged hardships suffered at the hands of Government and its officers. These complaints were mostly ill- founded and only served to show the inveterate intractability of the Sheikh and his disinclination to shape his conduct or his administration conformably to the views and principles of the Government of India. The latter, however, made it clear to him that they were not the least inclined to tolerate any further signs of disaffection from him, and as the year progressed he showed more inclination to be friendly and to listen in ordinary matters to his Poli tical Agent's advice, always excepting the matter of his Customs adminis tration. It is regrettable to find much mortality among the members of the America Mission.

Owing to the shallowness and intricacy of the waters lying between the pearl banks and the mainland it is impossible for His Majesty's ships to deal effectively with the evil, and failing the use of armed dhows, the only practicable means of coping with it will probably be found in the employment of a large steam launch of light draft, with a smaller craft in tow for use in very shallow water. Apart from the depredations of Ahmed bin Salman, the people of Abu Dhaluf were accused by the crew of a Persian dhow of having looted them when driven ashore by stress of wind. As a precisely similar offence was brought to the charge of the natives of Abu Dhaluf in 1893 the probability is that the present accusation is well founded ; but the details are still under the considera tion of Government.

Having received no encourage ment from us he had latterly been obliged to throw in his lot a good deal with the Turks. More intimate acquaintance with Sheikh. Jasim, the elder brother who was supposed to have resigned all active dealings with the tribal politics of Katar, proves that he is not by any means the Weary dotard that he was popularly supposed to be, but that, on the contrary, while it suits him to preserve the fiction that he has retired from active participation in the affairs of Government, nothing of importance is done in Katar without his being consulted, or exercising his influence directly or indirectly. In this connection the action cr rather inaction of the Turks in regard to the selection of a successor to Sheikh Ahmed, to which Captain Prideaux alludes, is of considerable interest. The Political Agent has done valuable work during the year in the direction of geographical research for the ArcLseoiogicai Eesearc . Gazetteer and has also received a Commission from the Archaeological Department of the Government of India to investigate some of the Phoenician tumuli on Manama Island ; an interesting project which he had not time to put into execution before the year closed.

Indeed its importance to us must daily increase in view of the gradual tendency of the shadow of the Baghdad Railway to materialise on the political horizon. The protracted struggle between the rivals in Central Arabia, Abdurahman bin Saood' and Abdul Aziz ' bin e2 airs ' Rashid' has been the chief topic of * interest and importance on the Koweit tide and is fully dealt with by the Political Agent. Bin Rashid, whose strong points were rather those of the Bedouin freebooter than the politician or man of affairs, met his death by surprise at the hands of his rival a few days after the close of the year, and it remains to be seen how long the temporary peace which reigns in the land will endure, or what steps the Porte will take to re-ignite the fire from which she hopes to pull the chestnuts. The loyalty of Sheikh Mubarek's attitude in the matter of his dealings ^ . .... ^ with us has on one or two occasions been Sheikb Mubarek s attitude. i-i i •• i«ii -ij laid under suspicion during the year, but it is doubtful whether the impeachment is deserved except to an extent which the dubious nature of our support of him renders a matter of necessity. The limited measure of normal backing that we do give him no doubt stands him in good stead, as on the one hand it must add to his importance and prestige in the eyes of the Arab public, and it also obliges the Porte to adopt a more cautious policy in regard to him than they otherwise would, but it has not hitherto been active enough to make it worth the Sheikh's while to compro mise himself hopelessly in his relations with the Turks, and for this reason the caution with which his conduct no doubt requires to be regarded may well be tempered with generosity, resting on the supposition that his loyalty to his obligations will no doubt increase in thoroughness in direct proportion to the infusion of that quality into the character of our own support of him. In any case the fact cannot be got over that he does not seem inclined at present to encourage any intrusion into his preserves except that of ourselves, as has been evidenced during the past year by the short shrift which he gave to such pioneers as Monsieur Hatinoglou of the Sponge Syndicate and the representative of the German Pirm of Wonckhaus &amp; Co. The trade in arms to Koweit is without doubt conducted briskly sub rosa Arms Trade s P^ e ^ )e Sheikh's prohibition, and to what extent Koweit might not become an entrepot for the insinuation of arms into Baluchistan, if the import into Maskat were stopped, it is difficult to say.

It is ratheru ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL probable that such arms as go to Koweit find their way either to Nejd or north wards to Turkish Arabia, a branch of the traffic which does not affect our interests directly.

Heynssens who was mentioned in the last report as having Customs and relieved Monsieur Waffelaert on transfer Comm3rce - Customs Administration. from the Caspian two or three days before the close of the year remained a3 Director-General of the South throughout the present 12 months, and to the European mercantile community at any rate has proved a reasonable and business-like Director. His transfer from Enzeli is said to have been a source of much gratification to the Russian Consulate to whom he had given a good deal of trouble, having gradually become de facto Governor of the port; and having, as he said, left the Enzeli customs in a high state of efficiency, he arrived with somewhat oversanguine ideas of his ability to cleanse the Augean stable at Bushire ; but was to some extent doomed to disappointment. His advent took place at a difficult juncture, when the oppressive effect of the B^glement Douanier issued in September 1904 and enforced with some strictness, had generated much irritation and discontent in mercantile circles. He was at first inclined to pursue even more hard and fast lines than his predecessor and his action under certain provisions of the R^glement, especially article 15 under which he insisted on consignees declaring their goods in person and imposed fines in the case of the slightest discrepancy between invoices and verified contents, caused much high feeling, ultimately resulting in the refusal both of Persian and European merchants to clear their goods from the Custom House pending the ventilation of their grievances. The native community went so far as to telegraph appeals to His Majesty the Shah and the Prime Minister and at the same time endeavoured to get the support of their comrades in Ispahan, Shiraz and Yezd. Not only did a great congestion of merchandise on the limited customs premises inevitably ensue, but orders were countermanded by importers and consignments diverted elsewhere to such an extent that in April and May trade at Bushire was practically at a stand still. On learning what the position was, the Tehran Authorities telegraphed to His Excellency the Derya Begi at the besrinning of June and called upon him to co-operate with the Director-General of Customs in making such con cessions as would induce the merchants to clear their goods. This after some persuasion, the latter undertook to do, on the understanding that pending full investigation of their grievances the usages previously holding would be reverted to. Meanwhile all the European firms, British and Foreign, had jointly framed and presented to their respective Consuls identical memoranda of their grievances under several heads of the R^glement, and the Director-General, who had already shown a disposition to remedy the reasonable complaints of the community as far as he could, received instructions from Tehran to discuss their difficulties with them with a view to ascertaining how far they could be ameliorated locally and which items required the orders of the Central Government. Monsieur Heynssens in a memorandum dated 2nd August 1905 responded to the merchants' representations in a way which removed many of their chief grievances ; and the result was that in spite of frequent reminders from His Majesty's Vice-Consul they would not bestir themselves to meet again in order to frame a reply to Monsieur Heynssens' memorandum. That was the position at the end of the year and warranted the presumption, which is believed to be a fact, that they have since been treated with reasonable consideration, and now have much less cause for discontent. On the whole, during the 12 months under report the Residency has enjoyed a welcome period of rest from those difficulties with the customs which were formerly so frequent. It is to be feared, however, that Monsieur Heynssens* methods with the native merchants and coasting traders have been too direct and inelastic to please them, and with the native public, who16 ADMINISTEATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL generally have the cordial support of the Mullahs, the Customs Administr f is still very unpopular. atlon Thus when in February 1906 the Director-General prohibited the land* of cargo from native coasting boats at private wharves as had previouslv h 1 ^ the custom, an appeal to the TJluma was at once made, and on this occasion th 1 latter were able to induce the Director-General to cancel the order ontl boatmen agreeing to discharge their cargo in the presence of a customs official 6 The fact is that the introduction of the new tariff has given an enorm impetus to smuggling, with which it is impossible for the Customs Admiak! tration, as at present equipped, to compete effectively, and any Director wh' attempts to do so with too much persistence, especially in reference to the arms traffic, naturally makes himself anathema to the native element. The result of this ubiquitous smuggling is that the customs import revenue at Bushire is gradually diminishing and the only effective remedv would be a return to an all round 5 per cent, tariff to escape which native craft would net find it worth while running much risk. In October 1905 the inland Customs Bureaux at Daliki on the Bushire- Shiraz road, and Godar-Balutak on the Ahwaz-Tspahan road were abolished' at the instance of the Residency and His Majesty's Legation. The smuggling of arms from Maskat to the coast of Fars and Persian Arms Traffic. Mekran has continued to flourish in spite of all efforts made to check it The present Director-General of Customs, Monsieur Heynssens, has, I believe done his utmost to contend with the traffic and specific information received of consignments of arms going across from Maskat has been at once communi cated to him ; but at present he is not adequately equipped for coping with the determined resistance generally offered-by the smugglers who are invariably assisted by the villagers on shore. Furthermore, it is impossible to expect petty native officials even if honest to do their duty fearlessly when located in isolated places, at the mercy of local inhabitants, who only tolerate their presence as long as they remain innocuous and merely ornamental. Thmat the small Tangistan port of Kari, in May 1005, a representatiye or the customs who had been deputed to inves igate a case of arms smueglinff was flogged^and expelledJiy the inhabitants, and on the proceedinff to the locality to his assistance, she was unable to take any action as the natives who were well armed would not allow anyone to approach the shore. On another occasion, in December 1905, a customs sailing-boat contaimnff a Mudir and four tofangebis was despatched from Lingah to intercept a boat from Maskat of whose departure from the latter port the Customs Authorities had been warned by the fiesidency. The boat fell in with the Dhow but was nred on and had a man wounded, and failed to prevent the Dhow from r 7tf nill S^ ? re , ai1 !* Partially landing her cargo. In the meantime the Mozaffer arrived with the Director of Customs, and as soon as she appeared the smugglers decamped to the hills with what rifles they had managed to land. The deputy Director, however, followed them and succeeded in unearthing some of the arms which had been buried; 85 rifles, 15,000 cartridges and 7 revolvers being recovered in all. g * a u i I mention these two instances to demonstrate the difficulties with which the customs at present have to contend, but it is hoped that the employment ae ve sea-going launches which the Government of India are having cons- cwnf + ^ombay Dockyard for the Persian Government and which are in +hp ^ ass ^ Customs Administration materially m the suppression of the traffic. -he export of the following commodities was placed under embargo ^ Embargoes. at different times during the year up to thtei^ofXeyeaf. 0 ' 18 0f ^ PerSian Gulf fr0m 17111 I)eoember 1903 that ?

On the other hand the prohibition against the export of carpus containing aniline dyes was suspended from April 1905 ostensibly to enable the Minister of Customs to make inquiry into the problem, but more probably in order to appease the carpet weavers who had accumulated large stocks of carpets made with aniline-dyed wool, by letting them unload and get their accumula tions out of the country. Mr. A. Gleadowe Newcomen, President of the British Indian Commercial „ . ,, r . . Mission to South-Eastern Persia, arrived British Commercial iVlission# , 'loi-i nyr • at Bushire on 12th May 1905, having been preceded a fortnight before by the other two members of his party, Messrs. Luffman and Ryan. The Mission had entered Persia from Bunder Abbas in the preceding November and travelling via Kerman, Yezd and Shiraz, completed its labours at Bushire. An interesting and important report of the itinerary and doings of the Mission and of the conclusions arrived at has since been published by the Government of India for Mr. Newoomen, and apart from other practical merits the work forms a valuable book of reference in regard to all matters of trade and communication in Southern Persia. It is unnecessary here to make more than passing reference to the work of the Mission ; for further details attention is invited to Mr. Newoomen's full report above mentioned. Suffice to say that the general conclusion come to seems to be that the position of the trade of the British Empire is not so bad as it seems at first sight and that a good deal can and should be done to ameliorate the commercial outlook. On the arrival of the Mission at Bushire (in the absence of the Governor) the Persian Foreign Office Agent having expressed his inability to call at the Resident's request on the President, and having subsequently been instructed to do so by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh at the instance of His Majesty's Legation, gave as his reason for the omission that while the British Authorities fre quently asked for the special treatment of their Consular Officers and persons in a special position like Mr. Newcomen, they did not altogether reciprocate, in their treatment of Persian officials in India. He said he spoke from personal experience at Bombay only, though be was inclined to think that the case was much the same at Calcutta. He was not able, however, to quote any special instances in point and it is doubtful whether this was his genuine reason, he having at first told the Resident that having been Consul-General in Bombay some years ago, he considered that he was of superior standing to Mr. Newcomen. (He eventually called just after Mr. Newcomen had left the Subzabad Residency for the Lawrence), His observations regarding his Indian experiences were, however, communicated to the Government of India and His Majesty's Legation. In May 1905, a Monsieur M. T. Hatinoglou, the representative of the . „ , Sponge Exploration Concessions Syndicate, The Sponge Exploration Condons Synd.oato. a compan y registered in London, arrived at Bushire from Europe, and asked the assistance of the Residency in obtaining concessions for 'the exclusive right to fish for sponges, pearls, corals, and all other undersea produce suitable for commercial purposes.' Monsieur Hatinoglou was advised to refer to His Majesty's Government in the first instance. This he did, and while correspondence was proceeding, he employed his time in exploring likely fields in Gulf waters. In October 1905 he informed His Majesty's Vice-Consul that he had obtained a concession from the Persian Government and soon afterwards proceeded to Maskat, where although the Sultan had been warned of his intentions, he was able on 9tb November to obtain a concession from His Highness for sponge fishing for 15 years, the cancellation of which was recommended, but was not considered feasible by His Majesty's Government. It was subsequently ascertained that the Persian concession had been obtained from His Majesty the Shah while travelling in Europe. d■W ■ 18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Public Health. Post Office. At the end of the year Monsieur Hatinoglou was awaiting the arrival of diving gear and a party of Greek divers from Europe and intended to put specific operations in hand on their arrival. Messrs. Erank C. Strick and Company intimated to His Majesty's Government in October 1905 that they Red oxide Deposits. bad succeeded in obtaining a contract with the Moin-ut-Tujjar for the output of red oxide on the Island of Hormuz and that in the desire to keep out foreign competition, they had paid an abnormal price for it. There has been no friction this year in regard to the post office, but negotiations have been proceeding during the year for the conclusion of an agree ment with the Persian Government regarding the parcel post only, the British Government maintaining that the British post oflaces in the Gulf occupy a privileged position and are not necessarily under obligation to conform to rules observed by other nations in regard to postal matters. The negotia tions were delayed by the absence of Monsieur Naus in Europe and had not been brought to conclusion when the year closed. There is fortunately little to record under this head. There was a mild epidemic of small-pox in March 1906. Epidemics. Beyond this and the detention of two suspected cases of plague on board the Fersepolis on her return from Bombay in May 1905, there is little to record, and the public health has been good. The Residency Surgeon as heretofore has been in charge of Gulf quarantine on behalf of the Persian Quarantine. i i • . i Government and no circumstances have arisen to generate friction with the local authorities. The representatives of Foreign Powers, however, continue to be increasingly jealous of the British Administration of the quarantine and leave no opportunity of assailing our regime. This attitude seems to be reflected to some extent at Tehran, for although the Residency Surgeon as Chief Sanitary Officer for the Persian Government; in the Gulf sends regular monthly reports to Tehran regarding the health of the Gulf Ports, the Sanitary Board, with the Shah's Erench Doctor Schneider as Secretary, has always shown a tendency to suppress or all but ignore the Eesidency Surgeon's communications and to push the irresponsible ones of I)r. Bussi^re. On 21st November the Russian Consul-General, Monsieur Passek, wishing to see a friend off to Bombay, went off in a sailing-boat from his house flying his Consular Elag and accompanied by his Cossack Escort, and boarded the fast mail steamer which is in fact always in quarantine and was as usual flying the Quarantine Elag. He and two of his followers remained on her as long as she was in port, afterwards returning to his house. On hearing of it from his Deputy the Residency Surgeon at once remonstrated with Monsieur Passek and placed his house in quarantine; but as there were English passengers on board who complained loudly of Monsieur Passek being allowed to board the ship and return to his house with impunity while they were sent to Quarantine Island to undergo quarantine detention, the facts were communicated by the Resident to the Legation with a view to the attention of the Persian Government being drawn to the matter. Sub^ sequently having been called upon by the Devya Begi on behalf of his Govern ment for an explanation Monsieur Passek addressed him a very lengthy communication in which after endeavouring to explain away the occurrence, he launched into an irrelevant attack upon the English Administration of the quarantine generally. Having regard to the visit of Dr. Eaivre last year to study the sanitary visit of Dr. Theodore Thomaon. aad quarantine conditions of the Gulf Ports on behalf of the Erench Govern ment, His Majesty's Government this year deputed Dr. Theodore Thomson of the Local Government Board on their own behalf to make a tour of the Gulf0 RESIDENCY FOE THE YEAR 1905-1906. 19 with a view to reporting to them on the position. This gentleman arrived at Maskat on 19th February where the B.I.M.S. Lawrence was placed at his disposal for the rest of his tour. Accompanied by the Eesidency Surgeon he visited all the Gulf Ports including Bahrein and Koweit and after completing his local investigations left for Bombay on 19th March to confer with the Government of India before going home. His report has not yet been issued. On 3rd September reports reached His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz' ■ ,,, that the bodies of persons who had died ea a iraz. 0 f cholera in the epidemic of 1904 had been exhumed for transport to Kerbela. On receiving confirmation of the news from Doctor Palmer, Mr. Grahame addressed His Boyal Highness the Shoa es-Sultaneh warning him of the danger and recommending that the exhumation should be prohibited for one year. He also interviewed the Imam Juma on the subject and Dr. Palmer furthermore reported it to the Sanitary Board at Tehran urging that the necessary steps be taken to stop the exhuma tion and this was apparently done. The total rainfall in the Bushire District was almost up to the average of Misceilaneoug. ^ ^ TT ^ the last ten years but did not fall season- EaiDfall and Harvest. , , 1 ■» o -ii ably and only an 8-anna crop resulted. In Shiraz, however, and other parts of Ears, especially Dashtistan, the fall was more propitious and the harvest again most satisfactory. Prices of food stuffs consequently fell considerably.

Telegraphic news was received from Henjam on 29th April 1905 to the effect that there had been several shocks qna es ' of earthquake in the vicinity of Bunder Abbas resulting in landslips at Isin and Ginao by which some houses had been thrown down and two persons killed. There was also an earthquake shock at Henjam on 2r)th April and one at Kishm on the 27th. The former caused a fissure in the plinth 20 yards from the outhouses of the Telegraph Department's buildings but no other harm resulted. In the beginning of July petty robberies became again prevalent on the _ • . t , outskirts of Bushire and were stated by Lawlessness in Bushire. ,11 i ji .,. . •, i « the local authorities to be the work of Tangistanis; but episodes which occurred during the Derya Begi's last Governorvship gave rise to the suspicion that this lawlessness may have been instigated by the Governor himself as a pretext for a lucrative punitive expedi tion into Tangistan. On the night of ?4th August a robbery took place at the house of an Arab named Najaf bin Ghalib, Agent in Bushire of the Sheikh of Koweit, and claimed by the latter as a subject. The owner was spending the evening with a friend and returned to find that his house had been ransacked and cash and property to the value of 610,000 stolen. It was a matter of common report that the robbery has been committed by certain of the Persian artillerymen stationed in the town ; and the local authorities have been continually pressed to bring the offenders to justice, but in spite of constant promises no effective action has been taken and it has been necessary to move His Majesty's Legation in the matter for such friendly overtures as be may feel in a position to make on behalf of the Koweiti. It is worth recording that a parcel of office stationery under despatch from the Residency to the Coal Agent at Bassidu, care of the Residency Agent at Lingah, was described in the transhipment pass issued by the Customs Administration as being exporte, i e., under a export to foreign territory. d 220 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GTJLP POLITICAL The Moin-ut-Tujjar arrived in the Gulf from Europe in November accom panied by an English Engineer named The affairs of tbe Mom-nt-Tajjar. MoComick. They visited the Islands ot Hormuz and Kishm including British Bassidu. After his visit to Bassidu the Moin-ut-Tujjar moved His Majesty's Minister for permission to use the British Station for the storage of red oxide; but as the course was considered likely to raise issues with the Customs Administration and cause other difficulties regarding our station, it was deemed advisable not to accord the permission desired. Lieutenant O t H. Gabriel of the Residency subsequently had Mr. McCormick as a fellow passenger between Bushire and Karachi and the latter afforded him a good deal of information. The Moin, it appears, had had great ideas of the mineral resources of Hormuz, but a careful exploration of the island convinced Mr. McOormick that apart from the red oxide there was nothing on the island of real commercial value. He hardly considered the sulphur deposits at Doolab on Kishm and at Khamir worth working, but if the Moin was quite decided to take them in band he recommended the employment of three or four Sicilian experts for the work. As regards the Moin's many schemes in Arabistan, Mr. McOormick strongly advocated as a preliminary measure the construction of an inexpensive light railway from Mohammerah to Shushter from whence communications with Ispahan and elsewhere would be opened up by the construction of good roads. A section of the Mamasenni Lurs occupying a tract in the hill country to the north-west of Busbire who have hitherto paid tribute to the Moin-ut- Tujjar, who enjoys this district in fief in partnership with Seyyid Shaboncara of Bushire, rebelled in January and expelled the Moin's representative from Henj a m their district. Hen jam and its affairs are primarily within the sphere of His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas, but owing to the fact that telegraphic communication has not yet been regularly established, ETenjam affairs of urgency have been necessarily referred during the year direct to the Residency. The status of the island and our Telegraph Station have been a source of constant correspondence during the period under report. At the beginning of the year the Arab villagers became restive and repeatedly importuned for assurance that they would not be handed over to Persian jurisdiction. Rear Admiral Sir George Atkinson Willes visited the island in company with His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas early in April 1905, and the latter sent in a report pointing out the difficulty of keeping them much longer without giving them an answer regarding their future status. The juncture was, however, held to be inconvenient for such a declaration as correspondence regarding the future status and limits of our station were still in progress at Tehran, and it was decided to follow dilatory tactics for some time longer. Meanwhile standing orders were issued by the Admiral at the request of the Government of India for all ships passing up or down the Gulf to call at Henjam. Things remained fairly quiet for some months except for a visit paid to the island by Monsieur Stas, Customs Director at Bunder Abbas, in June when according to the evidence of local witnesses, in endeavouring to persuade the Arabs to accept a customs post in their village he assured them that the post was not contemplated with any intention of annoying them but simply to make sure that the English did not claim the island as their property at some future date. A protest was made to the Persian Government regarding Monsieur Stas' conduct, but the latter having stoutly denied the action attributed to him it was decided not to press the matter as it was undesirable to do anything to increase the local ill-feeling which already existed. In September the Customs Authorities began collecting material for building on a site which was unpleasantly close to our own telegraph premisesRESIDENCY FOE THE TEAR 1905-1906. 21 and was objected to by the Director, Persian Gulf Section, both on sanitary and departmental grounds. The site was eventually changed at the end of October and another chosen to which the Telegraph Department had no objection. In December owing to an intimation that one of the Flagstaffs and the Customs House were to be moved to the Arab village by order of the Derya Begi, the inhabitants again appealed to the Sultan of Maskat whom they had first approached on 29th November; and at the same time renewed their importunities to the British Authorities, Meanwhile discussion had been going on in Tehran between His Majesty's Legation and the Persian Government as to our tenure and the limits of the Telegraph Station, the Foreign Minister producing the original concession and arguing from it that only houses were mentioned, not ground. His Majesty's Government, however, held that the acquiescence of the Persian Government in the actual facts of occupation from 1868 to 1880 must be regarded as equivalent to formal concession of land occupied. Early in March an agreement was come to on the spot between the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and the Belgian Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas for the allotment of an unobjectionable site. However, the Arabs again began to get uneasy when they realised that a building site in our.limits had been granted to the customs, and the Sheikh, Ahmed bin Obeid, intimated on 28th March that he was unable to restrain his men any longer. The Customs Authorities did not however see fit to suspend operations, and under these circumstances His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief Sir Edmund S. Poe, K.C.V.O., who was at the moment at Bunder Abbas with the Elagship, was asked to send a ship to Henjam to ensure the safety of our Telegraph staff. At the same time His Majesty's Charg^ d'Affaires urged upon the Persian Government that pending the conclusion of negotiations between the two Governments building work should be suspended. Meanwhile H.M.S. Fox had been promptly despatched to the island by the Admiral and remained there for some weeks to come. On 31st March it was suggested by the Eesidency that the Persian Government should now be informed that we recognised politically their sovereignty over the island hut that the necessity for safeguarding the welfare of our Telegraph staff in the future obliged us to insist on the maintenance of the status quo as far as the Arab village was concerned. This proposal was supported by the Government of India and was under consideration by His Majesty's Government when the year closed. At the beginning of the year under report, owing to the frequent raids a which were being made on caravans on Bus ue- iiaz roa the Bushire-Shiraz road by petty Chiefs along the route, this main artery of traffic was for a time abandoned in favour of the less convenient Eerozabad route. Eventually, after continued pressure from the British Consulate, His Royal Highness the Shoa-es-Sultaneh arrested and punished several of the road-guards whose conduct had become intolerable, and for a short time afterwards there was an improvement, but this was only temporary and by September the road-guards had reverted to their former blackmailing tactics. Captain E. E. Iledl, Indian Army, en route to Meshed via Shiraz and Tehran was menaced by them at the beginning of September and about the same time a caravan of Messrs. Dixon and Company's goods was molested and robbed near Konar Takhteh. At another spot near Pul Abgineh a naik of the Transport Department in charge of 100 mules bought by Major Arbuthnot in Ispahan was held up for some hours and blackmail was demanded from him at 10 Shahis per mule. Representations were at once made to the Ears Government and at an audience with His Imperial Highness on l^th September Mr. Grahame was assured in reply to his protests at the misconduct of the road-gaurds, that it had been decided to replace them by guards of regular infantry supplemented at intervals by a few sowars. The sarbazes were duly sent, three to each post to assist the tofangchis, but no sowars were actually deputed. Eor the rest of October and NovemberADMINISTKATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL matters improved a good deal as far as actusi:! robberies were concerned but both soldiers and tofangcbis combined in the endeavour to exact blackmail from muleteers and travellers, especially between Kazeroon and Borasjoon. They had the sense however not to molest His Majesty s Consul who travelled down the road to see things for himself. Early in 1906 the position again lapsed into its former lawless statej and the Shiraz Authorities now pleaded the disturbed state of affairs in Fars, brought about by the tyrannical Govern ment of the Shoa-es-Sultaneh, as their excuse for absolute inaction. At the end of the year, however,'the state of the road was again more satisfactory for the time being. A good deal has been done in this direction during the year thanks to the strenuous efforts of His Majesty's Charge Settlement of outstanding British claims. d'AffaireS, Tehran. At the desire of the Minister, a full list of the outstanding claims of the last ten years was submitted by the Kesident in August 1905 comprising 93 items of the aggregate value of Us. 2,78,480; 56 of these were forthwith pressed upon the Central Government and in March 1906 the Governor and Karguzar received peremptory instructions to exert themselves in the direc- tion^of their settlement. In pursuance of these orders they agreed to go through all the files of the cases with the Resident with a view to separating those claims which could not be disputed and should be paid forthwith from others which they saw reasonable grounds for questioning. Two long meetings were held before the close of the year during which 25 cases were gone into. Apart from these commercial claims several important matters which had been for years pressed without success upon the Shah's Government were satisfac torily settled thanks to the strenuous efforts of His Majesty's Legation, such as the claim for exemption from export duty on fresh provisions for His Majesty's ships in Harbour; but the Legation failed to move the Persian Government in regard to other pressing ones such as the nourder of Abu Thabi subjects by the inhabitants of Taona on the Dashtistan Coast and these are now under separate reference to His Majesty's Government. In cases with the Government of Fars, the Residency has received much cordial co-operation and assistance from His Majesty's Consul, Mr. George Grahame. The following travellers, whose move- Travellers. . S; i • - ments were ot some- interest, visited Bushire during the year :— Mr. Arthur Crawford, a young Canadian Journalist, who, starting from New York without funds, had undertaken to complete the circuit of the world on his feet or on roller skates within a space of two years, for a stake of £6,000 and an appointment on the staff of a New York paper, arrived at Bushire from Bassora on 12th March 1906 with the intention of travelling via Shiraz and Kerman to India. The unde sir ability of an Englishman begging his way across Persia was suggested to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, who held that he could not be legally stopped but should be warned of the risk he was running. Mr. Crawford was eventually dissuaded from entering the country and left by mail for Maskat and India. In March 1905 a Frenchman named Gaston Perronne with two servants arrived at Lingah by mail and proceeded thence to Debai where he obtained a lodging from the British India Steam Navigation Company's Persian Agent. He gave out that he had been sent out by a French Syndicate to examine the conditions of trade on the Oman Coast and in the Persian Gulf. The Sheikh and the people of Debai, however, objected to his presence and he was obligpd to leave after two or three days for Bahrein where he stajed some weeks and then returned to Europe. Another party of French travellers, a Madame Nnttan with her daughter and nephew spent some months in Bahrein during the pearling season. The lady is the widow of the head of an apparently well-known firm of jewel or pearl merchants in the Rue Lafitte, Paris, and came out to study the pearl trade on the spot. She did no business until just at the end of the season as she could not induce the Bania pearl traders to deal with her, but she wasRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906, 23 finally able to make purchases to the value of E4a j 000. The party left for Europe in October expressing their intention of returning for the following season. A distioguished Australian eye specialist, Dr. Kenny of Melbourne, arrived at Bushire in March 1906 with introductions from His Majesty's Foreign Office and travelled to Shiraz, Ispahan and Tehran, for the purpose of investi gating diseases of the eye, which are very prevalent in Persia. In March, Mr. G. Pilgrim of the Geological Survey of India who had spent the winter in geological exploration in the Gulf Kegion, journeyed across the Mussendum Promontory from Dibba to Ras-el-Khaima in order to get an idea of the mountain system. On his return he was conveyed in H.M.S. Lapwing to the vicinity of Halool Island, just north of which a spring of Bitumen had been reported. No trace of it, however, could be found. The Persian newspaper RaU-el-Matin issued in Calcutta which has a wide circulation in Persia has continued vernacular Newspapers. throughout the year to publish anti-English articles in connection with various current topics. The Seistan Missiop. and the meeting at Gharbar between Persian and British officials for the settle ment of pending claims in Mekran and Perso-Baluchistan have furnished it with a good deal of copy of this kind. The Editor of the Bushire newspaper Muzafferi who, it will be remembered, was bastinadoed by the Governor of Bushire three years ago in connection with his comment on the episode connected with His Excellency the Viceroy's visit, had his paper suspended for printing articles agitating for the introduction of reforms by the Central Government. Just after the close of the year he was summoned to Tehran in this connection but was allowed to return after reaching Mohammerah and intends to continue his paper under a new name. The Odessa Company's sailings to these waters continued fitfully during the year ; five vessels visiting the Gulf Russian Activity. Ports at irregular intervals. Their con signments for Busbire consisted chiefly of sugar, and on the homeward voyage they shipped tobacco. The Armenian soi disant Prince'' Anatouni arrived at Bushire by the Odessa Company's S.S. Vesta and after staying a few days in Bushire left early* in October for Shiraz, where Monsieur N. Passek, the Russian Consui- General at Bushire, was passing the summer. Erom Shiraz, Prince Anatouni proceeded to Ispahan and Tehran, and subsequently returning southward via Yezd, Kerman, Bam and Bunder Abbas, reached Bushire again in March 1906 where he stayed with Monsieur Grosky, the Agent of the Russian Lines. His doings as far as is known were chiefly limited to the endeavour to push Bussian 'sugar and piece-goods and to make enquiries-into trade conditions. He is said to^ave spoken freely in Kerman and elsewhere of the advantages Offered by the Bunder Abbas-Bam trade route. The inauguration of a Russian bank and Russian Consulate in Shiraz was promised but neither project has yet taken serious shape. Merchants in Shiraz appear to be shy of giving orders to Russian firms at present for the reason that commissions given last year to the Russian House of Scheibler at Ispahan, with payment in advance, have been six months or more overdue. In March 1906 the death of an inhabitant of Shiraz being popularly attributed to his having eaten Russian sugar much hostility towards the use of the commodity was engendered in the popular mind. A parallel incident took place at Debai on the Trucial Coast of Oman. The Resident was on tour to an unusual extent during the year, owing to the incidence of work in connectidi# Resident's tours. ^ pre p ara tion ^ of the Gulf Gazetteer as well as in the ordinary course of his political duties.w ^ 'a ' : 24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Shiraz and Ears. \ iiii liitl imt iiiii Several visits were paid to the Trucial and Northera Oman Coast and two interesting land journeys were undertaken, the first during October an 1 November from Bunder Dilam to Behbehan, thence along the course of th Hindiyan river to its mouth, and onwards via Mashoor and the Jerrahi river to Buziyeh and Pellahieh. Pinally the Bahmashir Canal and the ruins of Guban were explored and the expedition, in which the Eesident was accompanied by Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel and a surveyor, terminated at Mohammerah. In the following December an expedition was made from Bas-al-Khaim on the Trucial Coast to Baraimi in the Dhabireh and thence to the coast at Sohar where the Lawrence was in waiting. The primary object ofthi journey was to fix accurately the latitude and longitude of Baraimi with 8 view to the correction of the map in preparation for the new gazetteer Tr ^ Resident was accompanied by Lieutenant C.

As was anticipated in last year's report the grain crops were excellent Harvest. r th tbe P^n of barley, of Which a less quantity than usual was grown This probably resulted from the fact that many of the peasants, taught bv the experience of the preceding year, bad sown large areas with millet and maize, which they reserved for their own use. A satisfactory sign was the appearance of flourishing cotton crops in the immediate vicinity of Shiraz Shiraz was in a constant state of anarchy and unrest throughout the political Situation. the direct result of the oppressive . . TT . and unscrupulous Government of His Imperial Highness the Shoa-es-Sultaneh, the second but favourite son of His Majesty the Shah. In his Vazier, the Sardar-i-Akram, he seems to have found a congenial colleague if not a guiding spirit throughout the course of intolerable misgovernment into which he threw himself. Early in June a fanatical movement directed by Mirza Ibrahim a leadin* Mulla, was started against the Jews, who for five or six days in succession were assaulted in the Moslem quarters of the town and their felt Kulahs fcansV torn to pieces, the Moslems demanding that the community should wear i distinctive head dress. vyc&lt;u a On 4th June these assaults were brought to His Majesty's Consul's notice and he at once addressed a note to the Governor-General and naid a visit to the Jewish quarter* On 2 2nd June a Jew was shot dead in the immediate neighbourhood of Bhiraz andhis co-religiomsts on attempting to take the body to the Palace were prevented with considerable brutality by the Governor's Perrashes. as wiutrcSy U be 0 se 0 en JeWS COntinUed intermitteilt, y throughout the year „ 1905, by order of the Sardar-i-Akram two raids were committed on the village ot Kushk-i-Bidah belonging to Prince Jamal-ud-din, a great grandson of Path-Ali-Shah residing at Shiraz.

The real reason was the belief of His Imperial Highness that the Chief was intriguing against him in collusion with the Kawam-ul- Mulk. A. fortnight later, howeyer, bis chains were removed and modified liberty allowed the prisoner. On 30th September the Shoa-es-Sultaneh, probably feeling tbat he 1 ad created so much hostility towards himself in the minds of the people of Fars that there would inevitably be an upheaval against him if he remained longer, left for Tehran and subsequently for Europe for the purpose of consulting experts and undergoing an operation. He was accompanied by his enemy the Kawam as far as Tehran. When he left Shiraz he was believed to owe the Central Government the equivalent of more than 2J lakhs of rupees of revenue of which he had really realised upwards of half. Shortly after his departure it became evident that the excesses of his administration had become intolerable to the people of Pars and that a wide spread movement was now on foot to throw off the yoke and prevent his return. In the absence of the Prince himself tbe agitation was directed against his Vazier and accomplice the Sardar-i-Akram and about this time the British Consulate was on several occasions approached with enquiries as to the amount of support which could be expected from us. The mal-contents were from all classes ' of tbe community and the Kawam was said to have charged bis sons before he left not to allow any considerations for his personal safety in Tehran to deter them from every possible effort to upset the Shoa-es-Sultaneh's tyrannical Government. Prom the moment of His Highness's departure, Mirza Ibrahim, the leading Mujtahed in Shiraz, held weekly meetings at his house and on 17th November Consul Grabame reported that an agitation against the Vazier had also com menced and that the unrest existing in Shiraz was likely to spread to outlying parts of the province. The weekly meetings at Mirza Ibrahim's now became nightly and were attended by all the clergy and leading merchants. They appear to have been further incensed by the intimation tbat a Special Commis sioner from Tehran would be sent down to enquire into their grievances and a few days later telegraphed to their comrades at Bushire urging the need for their support by the suspension of all despatch of merchandise. This the Bushire merchants accordingly did for a time as a protest against the in difference shown by the Central Authorities to the complaints of the people of Fars generally. On 19th December a riot occurred at Kazeroon on the Bushire- Shiraz road, brought about it was said owing to an excessive tax levied upon opium. On 20th idem on hearing of the appointment as Special Commissioner of the Vazier-i-Durbar, a creature of the Sardar-i-Akram, who had paid heavily for his appointment, the clergy of Shiraz all adjourned to tbe Shah Chiragh Mosque outside the town together with the merchants and the populace. This appointment appears to have been cancelled as soon as made but a High Commissioner in the person of the Vazier-i-Makhsous arrived on 25th January. His powers, however, were not definitely stated or knosvn and meanwhile it became evident from telegrams passing from the Shoa-es-Sultaneh to friends in Shiraz, that Hrs Highness had not given up the idea of returning to Siiiraz ; accordingly on the 29th the leaders of the populace informed the High Commis sioner that if they did not receive from Tehran within three days satisfactory replies to their representations, they would resort to violence. On 6th February the leaders who had only been dissuaded from doing so before by Mr. Grahame's tactful advice, finally expressed their intention of taking sanctuary in the Con sulate grounds and were with difficulty prevailed upon to have patience for two days longer. On the 8th came the report that the Iqbal-ed-Uowleh had been appointed Governor-General in the place of the Shoa-es-Sultaneh, and this report, thougli it did not eventually take shape, had the eflect of pacifying the agitators for the time and there was general rejoicing followed by a deputation to the British Consulate for the purpose of expressing the thanks of the popu lace for the assistance of His Majesty's Legation to which they ascribed the success of their representations.26 ADMINISTKATION EEPOIlT ON THE PERSIAN GOLF POLITICAL Though comparative quiet now reigned in Shiraz for about a fortnight, there was still a ^ood deal of lawlessness prevalent, and this took the troublesome form of Jew-baiting. On 7th February, Monsieur Veneziani, an Italian Jew and leader of the community, reported that an attack on his co-religionists was arranged for the morrow, and solicited protection for his house 0 in which large quantities of Jewish merchandise were stored for safety, la pursuance of this request Mr. Grahame and his Consular Escort spent the night in the house of a European adjoining his premises. Nothing however occurred and for some days, during the general rejoicing at the apparent supersession of the Shoa-es-Sultaneh, the Jews were forgotten; but this did, not endure for a long time and about 20th February the Italian again complained that his servants were constantly beaten and robbed in the bazaar. Contrary to expectation the first ten days of the Mohurrum, which com menced at the end of February, passed without any incident except that the Jews were still oppressed and confined to their own quarters and were informed by the local authorities that their security could only be guaranteed by payment of 1,000 tomans by the community. The general position continued much the same until the end of the year owins? to the uncertainty which still continued to exist as to whether His Imperial Highness the Shoa-es-Sultaneh had really relinquished the idea of returning to Fars or whether he still had the ear of his father and meditated return when opportunity offered. The town and district of Behbehan, nominally under the Fars Govern ment, was in a hardly less turbulent state than the capital of the province, and the Shiraz Authorities were able to exercise no effective control over the anarchy which prevailed. There can be little doubt that in these efforts^ to emancipate themselves from the intolerable burden of rapacious oppression under which they suffer, the people of Fars have been emboldened by the success of the revolutionary movement in Russia; and for this reason they will not be appeased so easily with empty promises as they have been in the past. Visits of vessels Bushire was visited by the three 'subsidised' gunboats Sphinx, ofHisMajesty's^ • an(i Redbreast. One of these vessels remained on duty at Navy and the ancl in ^ shatt-el-Arab throughout the seven months ending March 1906, in connection with the patrolling of the river during the date-shipping season and the murder of a British Engineer in Messrs, Lynch's workshops at Marghill above Busreh. Vice-Admiral Sir Edmund Foe, K.C.V.O., Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, who arrived in the Gulf with his Flagship Eermes in the middle of March after attending the departure of Their Eoyal Highnesses the Frince and Frincess of Wales from Karachi on the termination (,f their Indian tour, had not yet reached Bushire when the year under report closed, R.I.M S. Lawrence was on duty with the Resident throughout the year as usual, and R.I.M,S. Investigator on arrival from Bombay on 29th September proceeded with the survey of Koweit Harbour, leaving again on 13th December to avoid the very cold weather in the Gulf during which in the previous season the crew had shown a tendency to develop Beri-beri. No vessels of Foreign Navies visited Foreign Men-of-war. Bushire during the year. Major F. Z. Cox, C.I.E., retained his post throughout the year and there was no change in the personnel of the Residency except as regards the Second Assistant Lieutenant C. H.

C hapter IL—POLITICAL REPORT POR HIS BEITANNIC MAJESTY'S VICE-CONSULATE, ARABISTAN, 1904-1905. P aet I.—PRELIMINARY. 1. The districts Which fall within the charge of the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz are :—Arahistan, Pusht-i-Kuh, and Lnristan. To these may be added the Bakhtiari country, as though official communication with the Bakbtiari Chiefs usually passes through the medium of tbe Consal-General at Ispahan, it is still the declared desire of the Indian Government that relations with the Chiefs should be maintained by the Vice-Consul for Arabistan. 2. The geographical limits of the charge above indicated may be given as follows:—On the south, the coast line westwards from Hindiyan, and its prolongation in the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab as far as the Turko-Persian border, a little above Eailiya. On the west, the Turko-Persian border, forming the western boundary of the district of Hawiza and. northern Arabis tan, till the latter gives place to Pusht^i-Kuh. Thus from a a indefinite point to the west of the Kerkha the line bears off to the west, striking Badara, i. Here it turns again northwards including Deh Bala, the Wali's summer quarters. About here the Turko-Persian border is quitted, and the Vice- Consular boundary, marching with that of the Kermanshah Consulate, may be taken as striking slightly to the N. of E. across Luristan so, as to include Hulilan, and Tarhon, the bead-quarters of the Dilfan Chiefs. Prom thence it proceeds to Burujird, including on the way the Lur Yailaqs (summer pasture grounds) of KhaWa and Aliashter. Prom Burujird a line drawn to Khonsar and on to Ispahan will include the Lurs of the Silakhor Valley, and the bulk of the northern Bakhtiaris, but will exclude on the north the province of Malaiyar Which falls within the sphere of the Consul at Kerman shah. Prom Ispahan the boundary again strikes roughly southwards towards the plains of Arabistan, following the eastern border of the Bakhtiaris. Reaching Arabistan it would pick up the eastern border of that province, and pursuing it reach its starting point at Hindiyan. 3. The limits above described may be regarded as representing the extreme area over which it is expected that the Vice-Consul should extend bis tours, and which, as far as possible, his topographical and political reports should cover. Prom the point of view of Consular responsibility or interven tion, under ordinary circumstances, the following qualifications would have to be made. All affairs concerning Mohammerah and its immediate vicinity would ordinarily be dealt with by His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah. It might also be accepted that the sphere of his action would, include Palla- hiya and the Lower Karun. A point however which to some extent would determine the course of official, reference, would be the place at which the Sheikh of Mohammerah was for the moment residing, i.e^ whether at Pailiya, or at^Muzaffariya or Nasiri. At the latter places he would be more readily approached by the Ahwaz Vice-Consul, granted his presence at head-quarters. 4. Again in Pusht-i-Kuh and Luristan a hard and fast line cannot be laid down dividing the jurisdiction of the Kermanshah Consulate from that of the Ahwaz Vice-Consulate, and the advantage of according to the officials at those posts some lattituae for the invasion of each others spheres does not require to be dwelt on. But the tribes and the country to the east of the Kashgan River would not under normal circumstances make any claim on the attention of the Kermanshah Consul. Khurremabad and Burujird also, as seats of the Luristan Governorship, fall definitely within the charge of the Arabistau Vice^Consulate. 5. Passing on, Ispahan has of course no concern for this Vice-Consulate, But the Bakhtiari Chiefs and the Abwaz-Ispahan road, while directly handledRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAE 1905-1906. 81 by the Oonsul -General at Ispahan, have been expressly commended to the attention of this Vice-Consulate. Bebahan might perhaps not be considered excluded from the possibility of Vice- Consular visitations ; and the liberty of the Vice-Consul to extend his journeys beyond Khurremabad to Kermanshah, for the express purpose, should it be necessary, of consulting with the Consul at the latter place, is assumed. ' '' ' ' ■- ; * ' * ■ H*. f. c.. II.—ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS. 6. The administrative divisions of the territory, of which the geographical boundaries have been given above, are as follows AraMstan. —Comprising two sections, Northern and Southern Arabistan. Southern Arabistan on the north includes Shakha, and the boundary runs westwards just excluding Alwaniya, and strikes the Gargar at A1 Haddam 6^ miles above Band-i-Kir. It leaves the r.b. of the Gargar at Khar Eawaishid 5^ miles above the same place, which is thus included in this province, further to the west it follows the north and west boundaries of the Anafija crossing the Diz, and continuing concurrently with the external boundaries of the Hawiza District. Southern Arabistan is under the administration of the Sheikh of Moham- merah, Sheikh Khaz'al, Sardar Arf'a, M'uizz-us-Saltana. He is represented by agents at the following places &amp;bdi, an (Arab. Sheikh Hanzal, his nephew. MulW Abbulla Ch'aab. Sheikh Rizaij Ch'aab. Siliya, Arab. Mulla Abus Saiyid, Al bu Kurd. Hawiza, which he administers for the Persian Govern- Maula Abid All, descendant men t. of the house of the Walls of Hawiza. These agents have very limited powers of initiative, acting almost entirely on orders received from the Sardar Arf'a. Everywhere the tribes are ultimately dealt with through their own chiefs. 7. Northern Arabistan. —This province is administered by a Persian Governor appointed from Tehran. Its sub-divisions are:—the Shmhter District, including the town of that name, most of the Miyanab, the 'Aqili District on the left bank of the Karun, lb Bid, Pawinda, and Daimcha lying towards Dizful. It may also perhaps be considered as taking in the section of the Bait Saad Arabs on the Diz under the sway of Sheikh Farhan Asad. The Anafija on the r.b. of the Shatait and on the lower Diz are subject to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Dizful District, including the town of that name, and Konak, and the country stretching from there to the Diz Eiver : the country on the West of the Diz including Salihabad, and running as far West as the Karkha, and on the South including Shush and the Arabs of the vicinity principally the Al Kathir of Sheikh Haider. Nominally the administrative area extends to the Turko-Persian Border, but the intervening country is occupied by portions of the Bani Lam and Bani Turuf, who are for all practicable purposes independent. Bdmuz District, including Mir Bacha on the West and Kal'a Sh^kh on the South, and marching with Bebahan on the East, is administered for the Persian Government by the Bakhtiari chiefs, 8. Pusht-i-Kuh is the kingdom of the Wali, Ghulam Eiza Khan, Sarum-us-Siltana, Sardar Asharaf. Its East and North-East boundaries may be said to be the Karkha Hiver, its South and West North Arabistan and the Turko-Persian Border. I am unable to state the exact situation of the line separating Pusht-i-Kuh from the Governorship of Kermanshah. Mohammerah, Ahwaz, Fallahiya, Biziya, Jarrahi (Khalfabad and M'ashur), Zaitunj82 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PEKSTAN GULP POLITICAL 9. Luristan* —This is a Persian Governorship, but in reality it is mainh occupied by autonomous nomad tribes. The Governor's resources are limited to tampering by intrigue with the mutual relations of the tribes. These relations are always in a state of unstable equillibrium, caused by the constant friction of the opposing interests of the various tribes and factions. On the South, Luristan is contiguous with Arabistan (Dizful District) and Pusht-i-Kuh, and on the West and North with Pusht-i-Kuh and Kerman- shah. On the North it includes the Ali, ashtar tract, and Burujird with the Silakhor Valley, and it marches on this side with the Governorships of Kermanshah, Nahawand, Malaiyar, and Iraq (?). The Eastern boundary of Luristan appears to be the Diz River. Builded habitations are confined to the Northern part of the province Khurremabad and some villages near it, Zagha and Eazon to the East of it' and Burujird and the villages of the Silakhor Valley. 10. The BakUiari This country is administered by the here ditary chief of the tribe. The tribe falls into two main divisions, the Haftlano* and the Chaharlang. The former is the more important, and to it belongs the stock from which are sprung the important individuals known as the Kbawanin-i-Bakhtiari, Of these two are nominated by the Persian Govern, ment to the official command of the tribe, under the titles of Ilkhani and llbegi. These two men are responsible for the payment of the Imperial revenue. I do not think that the effective control of these Khawanin extends to the West and North extremities of the territory occupied by the Bakhtiari tribes. I am under the impression that in that direction there is a region known as the ' Bakhtiari ' in which the Persian Government is represented, at least, by an official of its own. But of these matters affecting the northern boundary of the Bakhtiari tribe, I cannot at present speak with certainty. The exact line of division between the Bakhtiari and the tribes to the East such as the Kuhgelu, is also a point of uncertainty. On the West the boundary is the Diz Eiver, and on the South, the province of Arabistan. 'Principal tribes of Southern Arahistan. Tribe. Habitat. Chiefs. Fighting strength. B emabes.

Captain D. L. R. Lorimer was Vice-CoQsal throughout the year, but during his absence on leave in Europe from 7th June to 6th January, Manor Morton, R.E., on special duty, held acting charge. The following tours were carried out :— August 14th to November 20th Major Morton travelled up the Bakhtiari Road to Ispahan and returned by the same route. February 21st to March Ist Captain Lorimer paid a visit to Ramuz, proceeding by Raghaiwa and return' ing by Shakha. March 9th to 21st, a trip to M^shur was made, and the neighbourhood of the Ma'shur and Dorak Creeks was examined. ****** 2. Building of a Vice-Consulate, —This project made no progress, until in February 1906 Sheikh Khaz'al obtained an agreement from the M'uin ut Tujjar recognising the proposed site as the joint property of the Sheikh's son and his own son, and the full power of the Sheikh to act on behalf of both the partners. The opinion of the Government of India on the situation revealed by the instrument is awaited. If it is unfavourable, an alternative site will have to be looked for. The preparation of plans and estimates, in supersession of those drawn up by Mr. Beveridge, is in the hands of the Consulting Architect to the Govern ment of India. 2(of). Notification was received in April of the appointment of a Consular Surgeon for the combined Consulates of Ahwaz and Kermanshah. During the year which has elapsed since this post has nofe been visited by the Consular Surgeon. In January 1906, a Hospital Assistant, originally intended for Kermanshah reported himself for service at Ahwaz. No medical or surgical equipment has yet been received for the Vice- Consulate. With the remains of some drugs, etc,, received in 1904, and with extraneous assistance from Mohammerah and elsewhere, it has, however, been found possible to treat eight Persian soldiers suffering from gunshot wounds received in the Bani Turuf outbreak. The cases are still under treatment, but are progressing excellently. SOUTHEEN AEABISTAN. 3. There was no displacement of the governing authority during the year, supreme control resting in the hands of the Sardar Arf'a, Sheikh Khaz'al, assisted by his quasi wazir, Haji Ra'is ut Tujjar. Sheikh Hanzal remained in charge of Ahwaz. In April the Bani Turuf, an Arab tribe living close to the Turkish border, turned to their annual pastime of refusing to pay tribute to Sheikh Khaz'al, to whose charge they have been made over by the Persian Government. In answer to enquiries made by the Governor of Shushter the ordinary excuses were preferred, failure of the crops and poverty. Eventually an expedition was organised against them by the Salar Muazzam and Sheikh Khaz'al. The Salar contributed some 1,300 men to the forces. The expedition started on the 19th October, but no fighting to speak of followed, the authorities as usual deeming it expedient to allow themselves to be cajoled by the verbal submission of the Chiefs. Of the several leaders of the tribe, Haji Sabhan, who refused to submit to the overlordship of Sheikh Khaz'al, was driven into exile. 'Ali Minaishid andRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 37 Zahar 'Ali were entrusted with the charge of the tribal affairs, and Sharhan was made over as a hostage to the Sardar Arf'a. It was given out that the Bani Turuf bad paid up the sum of 40,000 tumans out of the 87,000 balance of arrears of revenue due for the seven preceding years, and that Ghazban of the Bani Lam had gone security for the remaining 47,000 tumans. After this the situation remained unaltered until the middle of March 1906, when Haji Sabhan suddenly reappeared from his retirement, treacher ously fell on the handful of Persian soldiers left in Hawiza, of whom three were killed and eight wounded, and made himself supreme in Hawiza. Sheikh Hanzal was deputed to the command of a levy of the Bawiya which had already been despatched by the Sardar Arf'a. From a multitude of conflicting reports the general impression is gained that in a little skirmishing which took place between the various sections of the Bani Turuf, small part was taken by the forces from this side of the river, who were encamped at Yallali^a on the left bank of the Karkha. To bring this episode to a conclusion, it may be stated that in the begin ning of April, Sheikh Hanzal fought a small action (in which the total casualties amounted to about 20) which resulted in the discomfiture and flight of Sabhan. 4. The state of this part of the country has been unhappy during a considerable portion of the year. In May the A1 bu Rawaya and Marau, una tried conclusions with the Bani Tamim. This ended in their retreat to the right bank of the Karun opposite Wais, where they have remained since. A dispute between the Shurafa and the Bani Sala succeeded a month later, in which both parties received (? assistance) from the Bani Turuf. The Bani Sala carried the day. Still later the Ahwaz neighbourhood was perturbed by the incursions of raiding parties of the ill-famed Khasarij section of the Bani Lam. 5. During the year a long-standing dispute between the Sardar Arf'a and the Bakhtiari Khans reached a crisis. Eaghaiwa is a small settlement at the foot of the outer hills North-East from Wais. It was originally accounted the property of the Sheikh, but his representative Mulla Thani, in whose charge this part of the country was &gt; appears to have neglected it. The Bakhtiaris assumed the grazing rights of the locality, and gradually a small settlement came into existence. Refugees from the Sheikh's jurisdic tion found it a convenient place of sanctuary, and demands for their surrender, were consistently refused by the Khans. In April last Haji Rais almost succeeded in obtaining the consent of the Samsam-us-Saltana and his party for the lease of the land to the Sheikh, but at the last moment they cried off. In July the matter was again brought into prominence by the flight of Sheikh Masikh with a number of bis adherents to Raghaiwa. Masikh alleged oppression on the part of Zahar Earhan, the Sheikh's representative at Wais, who is also responsible for most of the previous desertions. A proposal that we should act as intermediaries was made impossible by the remoteness of the Bakhtiari Khans at that season. The Sheikh made reference to Tehran. Masikh returned in the course of a month or so, but the general question remained unsettled, until permission was received from Tehran to effect the repatriation of the remaining refugees by force. In November Zahar Tarhan (of Wais) and the Zargham um Mumalik, the Salar Muazzam's military commander, left in company to put this into practice. Instead however of endeavouring to induce the Arabs to return, this estimable couple contented themselves with permitting the abuse of their wives and womenkind by their followers. The Sheikh was greatly incensed, and Parhan has spent his time since under open arrest at Failiya. As regards the political question, the deposition of the Samsam, an old enemy, and the elevation of the Sardar As'ad, a friend, of the Sheikh's, finally removed all tension.38 ADMINISTEATION KEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL It is now said that in the reported compact formed between the two factions of the Bakhtiaris it was settled that Eaghaiwa should be leased to the Sardar Arf'a for two years at a yearly rent of 1,200 tomans; but this cannot be regarded as certain. 6. Crops, etc, —Eain having come too late, the crops in 1905 were not successful. Again in the present season the first rains required for sowing did not arrive till the middle of January. In consequence the area sown is not very- extensive, but there is every likelihood that what has been sown will turn out very well. Last hot weather was, by comparison, a mild one, and in the end of December there was a short spell of phenomenal cold, some degrees of frost being registered. 7. Northern Arahistan. —At the beginning of the year the Governor was the Azim-us-Saltana—a cypher. In the beginning of April the Salar Muazzam came down through the Dirakwand country with a force of 2,000 or 3,000 men, and joined the Mzim- us-Sultana at Dizful. His commission was stated to be the coercion of the Bani Turuf. In May, however, he relieved the Azim of the Governorship, and has remained on, till the present as Governor. He quickly asserted for himself a power and authority which have not been known in any ruler in recent times. In Shushter he began with the destruction of the house of Kazim Khan, Kalantar, a man who had been a cause of many disturbances, and a thorn in the side of the Azim. It was less this, however, that led to his murder, with every accompaniment of barbarity, by the Salar, than his wealth and the fact that he was an ancient enemy of the Salar's uncle, the Mzam-us-Saltana. His wives and family were rendered houseless and reduced to begging their bread. 8. The famous religious house of Sheikh Muhammad ' Ali also attracted the ill-will of the Salar, and on the death of the old man himself, in autumn, his sons found themselves unable longer to tolerate the oppression of the Salar and left the town. This spring however their representations to the religious chiefs of Ispahan led to the Salar arranging for the return of the eldest son with every circumstance of consideration and respect. The youngest son, Sheikh Murtaza, is said to have lately been extremely honourably received by the Shah in Tehran and his return in triumph to his home is expected shortly. The rival religious house of Saiyid 'Abd-us-Samad, the acting partner in which is his son Saiyid J'afar, has on the whole received favourable treatment at the hands of the Salar. 9. In Dizful, except at the commencement, outwardly friendly relations were maintained with the leading religious authority, Muhammad Hussain Mujtabid, whose influence in the town is supreme and undisputed. It may be put to his credit that he has never failed to use his best efforts to save the victims marked out by the Salar's rapacity. 10. The Salar is a man of force and ability, but avaricious, more than cruel, and entirely selfish. He seems incapable of any generous sentiment and one seeks in vain in his acts for any trace of compassion or even mercv! It is only fortunate that, for the furtherance of his own designs, he has found it convenient to exercise his redoubted powers towards introducing peace and security into the country. He has unquestionably amassed a handsome fortune during the year. He has found a fitting lieutenant and a pious imitator in the Muizz -um -Mumalik whom he has at certain times kept beside him, at others deputed to Dizful or Shushter, In February 1906 the Salar was granted the new title of Sardar Mukarram, and received the Howiza district in fief for three years. Rumours of his approaching removal have for some time been current but they have not as yet been proved correct. 11. The Salar's policy has not been confined to the humbling of the townships. He took an early opportunity of exacting a demonstration^ of his subjection from Earhan Asad of the Bait Sa'ad.RESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 39 Haidar of the A1 Kathir at first eluded his grasp, but during his stay at Dizful the. Salar manoeuvred for a position from which he could effectively treat him as a recalcitrant revenue defaulter. Failing to secure his person, he proclaimed him a rebel and was able to follow up this declaration by depriving him of his sheikhship, and dividing it between two of his relations, Khuraibat and Mizaban. The latter has since incurred his displeasure, and is now in confinement. The aged Karim K.han, Paili Lur, has also been marked out for severe treatment. Attempts to overawe or entrap Khanjan Khan, Sagwand, were less successful. A long epistolary contest was maintained. In its outcome the honours rested with the native wit and diplomacy of Luristan, and the Salar has outwardly relented. When in the spring of 1906 the affairs of the Bakhtiaris fell into confusion the Salar aspired to play the part of arbitrator, but his overtures met with a chilling reception, and he failed to establish his indispensability as an intermediary. Both on this occasion, and at other times of disturbance, the Salar did really accomplish something towards securing the safety of the route between Shushter and Dizful. 12. Beyond the general maintenance of order, the establishment of a school at Shushter appears to be the only work of public utility which can be ascribed to the Salar. His relations throughout with Sheikh Khaz'al have been cordial, unless it be true that just recently the conditions laid down by the Sardar Arf'a for granting a loan of 4,000 tomans, have irritated the latter into dropping his usual guise of suavity. 13. Towards British interests the Salar has not shown himself at all partial, but they have benefited on the whole by the general security. During his term of office some pretence has been maintained of protecting the SJiushdn plying on the Gerger, and it is a negative tribute to his adminis tration that no repetition of the attacks of April 190di and previous years has taken place. An embargo which he placed on the export of wheat, on his own authority and in his own interests, hampered Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and again at the time of the Bani Turuf expedition he showed himself very unaccommodating in the matter of releasing transport for the same firm. Such practical acts of unfriendliness he has of course always tried to obscure by clouds of hypocritical verbiage. 14. The Bakhtiaris. —The year which just terminated has not been a happy one for the Bakhtiaris. At its commencement the llkhani and Iib5gi- ship had just been confirmed on the Samsam-us-Saltana and the Shahab-us- Saltana. The former was not popular, and he has little that is conciliatory in his character. Differences soon arose with the party headed by the Sardar As'ad and the Salar Arf'a. The result was that the security of the Road was, during the hot-weather, impaired by raids and robberies. These, whether committed by Bakhtiari subjects, or by Kuhgalu with or without Bakhtiari instigation, were equally the fruit of the dissensions among the Khans. This state of affairs afforded some grounds for the charge that the Samsam was not fit for the paramount leadership of the tribe. There is reason also to believe that Sheikh Khaz'al seeing an opportunity of avenging old grudges and securing his object in the affair of Raghaiwa {vide paragraph 5) employed his influence to assist in the downfall of the Samsam. This event finally took place in December, and the Sardar As ad and the Salar Arf'a succeeded to the vacant posts. Tlie Samsam and the Shaiab hurried off to press their case at Tehran. Hostilities supervened between the representatives of the two factions at ^qili Ab Bid, Ramuz, Jaizum and the hills. In February the Salar and the M'uin Humayun (the Shahab s brother) were found confronting each other at Ramuz. A spark was only required to produce a general conflagration. Negotiations however were entered into.40 ADMIN ISTEATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Whether they were accelerated or not by the intervention of Haji Ra, is must remain uncertaio, hut at any rate an armistice was arranged on Qr about the 23rd Pebruary, and the greater part of the levies raised by the Salar were disbanded. A fortnight later a more secure compact was arrived at which nothing has as yet occurred to disturb. It is stated that it was agreed that the leadership of the tribe was to revert to the Samsam and Shahab, but time alone will show whether this is true. It is on the whole to be hoped that it is as in that case the really stronger party will be in the position of recognised authority, and a stronger administration is to be hoped for. The whole sequence of events has only gone to prove the weakness of the Bakhtiari confederacy, now that they have no chief of commanding character and influence remaining among them. The jealous ambitions of the Khans has cost them dear both in property destroyed and in cash payments made to secure the favour of the Persian Government. 15. The perennial friction between the Khans and Messrs. Lynch Bros, shows no signs of dying a natural death, although no serious crisis occurred during the year under review. It may be regarded as chronic so long as relations of any sort exist between the two parties. A new series of commercial relations has been introduced by the agreement signed in October by the Oil Syndicate and the Khans. This concern has been very unhappy in the year of its inception, owing to the Bakhtiari parties to the agreement being divided between,the two hostile factions. LTJRISTAN'. 16. The Parman Parma, after exhausting every artifice of procrastination, had at length to yield to the pressure of the British Legation, exerted through the Persian Government. He left Kermanshah in January 1905 with a handful of troops to undertake the disciplinary measures against the Dirakwand made necessary by the attack committed by them on Colonel Douglas and Lieutenant Lorimer. He did not however reach Khuremabad till May. He was accompanied by Captain Williams, I.M.S. Arrived there he declared himself unable to organise punitive measures, and asked that he should be given until the following autumn to set things in train. Meanwhile the Salar Muazzam, deputed to bring the Bani Turuf Arabs to book, passed down to Dizful with a force reported to amount to over 2,000 men. He traversed the country of the Dirakwand with the consent of their chiefs, who were duly rewarded. In July by the instrumentality of the Sagwand chiefs, Pazil Khan and Hassan Gidaw, the Parman Parma effected the capture of 12 of the Mira chiefs. It was the fruit of the arts of Persian diplomacy, or what elsewhere would be known as breach of faith. The Governor claimed that at least five of these men were present when the outrage was committed, but, from a photograph supplied, the officers concerned were only able to identify one man. One of the prisoners was released, and one died ; the remainder are still in confinement at Kermanshah. 17. Early in 1906 the Parman Parma resigned his governorship, and made over that of Luristan to the Salar-ud-Daulah, who had been relieved of the same in May 1904. The Salar is married to a daughter of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, who has shown himself attached to his interests on more than one occasion. Were^ his expenses guaranteed there is little doubt that the Wali would be glad, if desired, to exterminate or crush the Dirakwand. 18. The not very harmonious planetary system of Luristan was abnormally perturbed this year by the passage of a meteoric 'body, in the person of the Shahab-ul-Lashkar, Chaharlang Bakhtiari. Moving from his own country to the East of Burujird, he struck across Luristan, coming in contact on his way with the Dilfan and the Dirakwand. He was accompanied on the latter part of his progress by the Sagwands Pazil Khan and Hassan Gidaw. About the end of 1905 a successful action was fought against a force of the Dilfan near Gulgul, and again at Tang-i-Chiil. A few days later an encounter took place with the Dirakwand at the Ab-i-Zal, of which the issueRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905.1906. 41 was in doubt till the timely arrival of Khanjan with reinforcements from the Arabistan side decided it in favour of the wanderers. For some time the Shahab had his camp at Qilab, but he did not delay putting his services at the disposal of the Salar Muazzam. They were accepted and after employment in policing operations, he was eventually installed in Dizful as Deputy Governor, when the Salar, now Sardar Mukarram, left it for Shushter inTebruary. The Shahab by his eccentric movement has incurred the disapproval of the Bakhtiari Khans, but this has not prevented each of the opposing parties from courting his adhesion. The chief result from our point of view of the incursion of the Shahab-ul- Lashkar has been the accentuation of the hostility between the Dirakwand and the Sagwand, which in its present form the latter attribute to the occur rence of the attack by the Dirakwand on our officer. To this is to be added the breach of the peace between the Sagwand and the Dilfan, which affords subject for regret. Messages expressing friendship and desire to co-operate with us continue to be periodically received from the Eath-i-Sultan, the chief of the Dilfan. As we are specially interested in Khanjan, a more detailed account of his affairs may be considered desirable. 19. Owing to enmity with the Dirakwand, Khanjan did not essay to leave Arabistan for the hills in the spring. In May the Salar Muazzara sent stringent orders for him to take his tribe up to Khurremabad, but they were not obeyed. The Salar then referred the matter to the 'Wali 'Ahd in Tehran, and the Farman Farma. In due course telegrams were received from both directing that Khanjan should be evicted, the assistance of the Wali of Pushtu i-Kuh being invoked if necessary; but eventually in June a compromise was agreed to by which Khanjan was allowed to remain in Arabistan, while Hassan Khan, his brother, went up to Khurremabad. In July Khanjan effected a great coup in plundering the sons of Saiyid Na'ama, who had come to the , Amla Karim Khan to buy wheat accompanied by a large following. The Salar took exception to Khanjan's action, and refused his explanation that he had acted on behalf of Government, because Saiyid Na'ama's sons had not obtained official permission to buy wheat from the 'Amla. A long dispute succeeded in the course of which Khanjan handed over a portion of the plunder to the Sala, but absolutely refused his demand tbat he should come in to Dizful, except on security given by the chief Mujtahid. Finally, he removed to the right bank of the Karkha. The Salar subsequently invited Mm to join him in the Bani Turuf expedition, but Khanjan refused suspecting a trap. Orders were then issued forbidding him and his followers' entry to the town. Sheikh Khaz'al also asked for his services on the same expedition, but Khanjan was still distrustful. When the Muizz-um-Mumalik was called to Shushter jby the departure of the Salar Muazzam for the Bani Turuf, Khanjan again appeared in the vicinity of Dizful. He was welcomed by the leaders of the town, and it was arranged that he should undertake the protection of the crops on the right bank of the Diz, receiving 120 tomans per mensem on account of 12 sowars, and 90 tomans in his own name. This arrangement continued to give great satisfac tion to all the parties concerned, until, on the return of the official authorities to Dizful, it had to be abandoned, and Khanjan withdrew to a safe distance. Since then the old wrangling has been going on, the authorities com manding Khanjan to come in, and the latter persisting in his refusal, and occasionally making his importance felt by a minor raid or foray. In March Khanjan is said to have got on to friendly terms with the Shahab-ul-Lashkar, after the appointment of the latter to the Deputy Governor ship of Dizful on the departure of the Sardar Mukarram and the Mu'izz- um-Mumalik for Shushter in February.42 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 20. FmJit-i'Kuh. —Efforts made to get into communication with the Wali were at length crowned with success. One of his confidential agents, Saiyid J'afar, paid a visit to Sh&amp;kh Khaz'al in April 1905, and occasion was taken to make his acquaintance. He expressed a great desire on the Wali's part for our friendship, and ex tended pressing offers of hospitality. Later in the year, when Major Morton had gone to the Bakhtiari country, the Wali's principal agent, Ka.id Kham came to Nasiri bearing answers from the Wall to letters which had been sent by the hand of Saiyid J'afar. He was induced to leave a note of the terms proposed for the projected Saimarra caravan route. During spring 1906 several communications and repeated invitations were received, but pressure of other work made it impossible to pay a visit to the Wali, or ev^en to meet Ka,id Khani at Dizful. The latter started on his way down to Nasiri for the second time, but was recalled on the road by urgent affairs. 21. In the domestic affairs of Pusht-i-Kuh the chief event was the re crudescence of hostilities between the Wali and his sons. This revolt against paternal discipline has become a hereditary peculiaritv of the ruling family. A composition took place in spring, and the year under report closed in peace. BRITISH COMMERCIAL INTERESTS. 22. Messrs. Lynch Bros, —The year has not been a particularly favour able one for the operations of this firm. Though large quantities of wheat were available from the Miyanab and Shakha, the vexatious and unauthorised embargo placed on its export by the Governor, the Salar Muazzam, concentrated the stream of profits into his own pockets, and probably also those of his friends the Sardar Arf'a and Haji Rais. Messrs. Lynch Bros, had made considerable advances to cultivators when the crop 'was assured, and they were left with the difficult business of - recovering these advances in cash. In the present seasons the embargo has again been imposed from Tehran. Shushter crops are reported as certain to yield a bumper harvest, and Shakha is also very good. Even down here, and on the saying of Haji Ra,is, the crops will be good, though the area sown is limited. The Customs Authorities have telegraphed four times to Tehran, but without result, and up to the moment of writing (18th April 1906) no noti fication has been received of the removal of the embargo. In no case is an embargo against export of grain to Europe justified by the facts. 'Ihe heavy excise on export, and the narrow margin of profit on wheat in London, act as an automatic check, and afford ample security against local scarcity being produced by excessive export. 23. The Bakhtiari Eoad has suffered from the disturbed state of the country, but more from the bad state of the track. There is no room for doubt that for a considerable period the condition of the Road has been extremely bad, and that it is rapidly degenerating further. In gauging the reports of travellers it is to be remembered that thiere U a difference in the demands made by a private party, where the loads are on the whole light and there is an abundance of attendants, and those made by the ordinary trade caravan, where loads are heavy and animals numerous, not picked, and accompanied by the minimum of attendants. Leaving Lynch out of the case, the object to be aimed at would seem to be the establishment of a permanent work party on the road, to be supplemented when necessary, and the termination of the present system cf occasional spasmodic efforts to repair it, when its repair has become both urgent and diificult.RESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1805-1906. 43 24 The Concessions Syndicate Limited. —An agreement between the Syndicate and the Bakhtiari Khans for the exploitation of oil fields in the territory of the latter was reduced to writing and signed in October. Plant has been shipped out in large quantities from England to Moham- merah, and thence to Shikara near Nasiri. Since January it has been gradually conveyed on by carts to a point four miles to the North East of Ramuz. Considerable difficulty has been experienced over the question of the provision of guards and escorts by the Bakbtiaris, who in consideration of a quarterly payment of Rs. 500 bound themselves to furnish all necessary protec tion. In the absence of the Samsam, Shahab, and SMrum-um-Mulk, three out of the four signatories, only the Sardar As'ad remained to put pressure on. His principal efforts have been directed to securing the payment of the whole guard money to himself, on the grounds that the others were unable to participate either in the provision of the guards or the burden of responsibility. Though every concession that justice would allow has been made to him, the measures of protection provided by his deputy the Salar have been altogether insufficient and unsatisfactory. (Note, 18th April 1906—matters are now improving.) How far this has been due to culpable neglect, and how far to the embarrassments of the position in which they have lately found themselves, is a question which it is impossible to answer at this stage with certainty. Our main object has so far been secured, in that work has never been brought to a standstill. A native surveyor encountered some obstruction in his work at Shardin, but in this case reclamations proved successful. 25. It is hoped to undertake boring operations at Masjid-i-Sulaimani, as well as at Shardin, but the first step towards this is the survey of a cart road to the spot. This awaits the arrival of a surveyor whose services have been promised by the Government of India. The European staff of the Syndicate out here consists of 4 Britishers, 11 Oanadiaus, and a few Austrians. OTHER MATTERS OP COMMERCIAL INTEREST. 26. The Kdrun Irrigation Scheme and Survey Work. —Van Roggen, the Shah's Dutch Engineer, left shortly atter the beginning of April 1905. He did very little outdoor work, and hatched out a paper scheme, which Major Morton stigmatised as absurd. It is said that he saw the Shah in Europe, and that he has arranged with firms in Europe for the supply of all the plant which his scheme requires. According to report he is now again in Tehran, 27. Major Morton continued his independent researches with the assistance of the Vioe-Consular Surveyor and another, till on into May. After having taken over the duties of Vice-Consul in June, in August he started up the Bakhtiari Road and returned to Nasiri in^November having surveyed the route with a view to finding an alignment which would permit of adaptation for wheeled traffic. Since the beginning of January 1906 he has again been mostly in camp, taking levels over the country to the east of the Karun below Ahwaz. 28. The M'uln ut The M'uin ut Tujjar paid a prolonged visit to Arabistan in the cold weather, with a view to promoting his business interests. He visited both Shushter and Dizful. He was accompanied by a Scotch Engineer of the name of McCormick, but he had difficulty in obtaining the full advantage of his advice owing to the want of a properly qualified interpreter. Among other matters the M'uin examined the question of introducing a tramway or automobile service between Shushter and Shalaili or Band i Kir , the bridging of the Karun above Shushter ; the irrigation of the country to the South East of Shushter; and the rendering navigable of the channel of the Gerger between Shushter and Shalaili. With these proposals the names of the Sardar Arf'a, the Sardar Mukarram, and Haji Rais were variously connected.44 administration report on the persian gulf political 29. Little reckoning has to be made with these schemes. The M'uin however personally stated to the Vice-Gonsul in February that he had a steamer building on the Clyde which was almost due for delivery, and he has lately purchased a small sternwheeler belonging to the Astrabadi Company at Baghdad. With regard to the latter it is stated that the Turkish Authorities have refused permission for it to be removed from Turkish territory. It i s the M'uin's intention to run one steamer on the lower, and one on the upper Karun. Haji Ra 5 is is in debate as to whether he will accept the agency of these ships. He averts that he would not permit a policy of cutting rates, if he were in charge. The capability of a Persian in the M'uin's position and with the service he commands to keep steam boats running, apart from the question of making them pay, is more than doubtful. 30. The Russian Consular Agent at Ahwdz. —Mr. ter Meulen returned from a trip to Europe in June. He was made the recipient of some sort of order from the Russian Government. It is difficult to see what he does for the Russian beyond mixing their name in his sometimes rather questionable business affairs. Presumably he acts as a news-writer. The result of his visit home was the arrival of a business compatriot, M. Gratama. This gentleman, who approved himself to Britishers here, is bv way of entering into partnership with ter Meulen. The latter is talking very big of the extension which is going to take place in his business. With abundance of capital, an agency at Mohammerah, the help of the M'uin-ut- Tujjar's competition in the River shipping, and the agency which he holds for Messrs. Strick, he is going to sweep Messrs. Lynch Bros, off the field. M. Gratama left in March, but he returns in autumn. As the evidence of things not seen in the way of increase of business, ter Meulen's establish ment has just been doubled by the arrival of a young Dutch assistant. In the meanwhile he has to ask Messrs. Lynch to collect his bills for him in Shushter. european visitors. 31. Colonel Bailward and Mr. Woosnam, the naturalist, completed their tour in Arabistan, and left in April, travelling north by the Bakhtiari Road. Mr. Pilgrim of the Geological Survey of India, arrived at Ahwaz in May and paid a brief visit to the nearer ranges of the Bakhtiari Hills He left Ahwaz for India on June tth. Nothing is known of the results of his in vestigations. In autumn a Trench Commercial Agent, M. Alexandre, paid a visit to Shushter and Dizful. In October a Gennan traveller came down, it is believed from Kasr-i- Shirin through Pusht-i-Kuh territory to Dizful and Awaz. He neglected to put himself under the protection of the W^ali, and by the time he had reached Dizful he had parted with almost every article of value he possessed. He did not make any attempt to refuse to part with his property. M. de Morgan and party paid their usual brief visit to Susa, remaining only two and a half months. The Comte de Caloune, a [Frenchman, was their guest. The Persian agent of a Russian trader, Telesky, visited Ahwaz, Shushter, and Dizful this spring trying to get orders for Russian goods. It is not understood that he was very successful. The Secretary of the Russian Consulate at Bushire came up the Karun in March, and went on to Shushter and Dizful. D. L. R. LORIMER, His Majesty's Vice-Consul for Arabistan. Ahwaz ; The 21st April 1906.RESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 45 C hapter III.—ANNUAL EEPORT OE THE KEEMANSHAH CON SULATE EOR THE YEAE ENDING THE 31ST MAECH 1906. The jurisdiction of the KermaBshah Consulate extends to the Provinces of Kermansbah, Hamadan, Kurdistan and Malayar. These districts comprise practically the whole of Western Persia, i.e., to the south of Azarbaijan, north of Luristan, and west of the small Province of Irak (with Sultanahad as the seat of Government), as far as the Turkish frontier, and includes the cities of Kermanshah, Hamadan, Senna and Daulatahad, besides the smaller towns of Asadabad, Kangarvar, Bijar, Sakiz, Kerind and Kasr-i-Shinn. Each of these four provinces is governed, by a Governor appointed by the Central Government at Tehran, and each Governor appoints the Deputy Governors for the sub-divisions of the Province administered by him. Thus, the Province of Kermanshah includes the sub-divisions of Asadabad, Kangarvar, Kerind, Sar-i-pul and Kasr-i-Shirin, while that of Kurdistan includes Sakiz, Bahneh and Gerous : this latter is a small province in itself, with the seat of government at the town of Bijar. Of the four provinces, Kermanshah, from our point of view at least, is the most important, and it is in the chief town of Kermanshah Province—Ker manshah or Kermanshahan—that the Consulate was established in 1904. In the end of 1903 I was appointed as Vice-Consul to Kermanshah and arrived here in the beginning of July 1904. On arrival here, I relieved Mr. H. L. Eabino, Manager of the branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia here, who had acted since the death of the Vakil B ed-Dowleh, British Agent, as Consular Agent. I found established here a Turkish Consul-General, with a Consul acting under him, and a Eusaian Consul, M. Nicolski, who had been appointed here also at the end of 1903 and had come down at once to take up his appointment. As I found that M. Nicolski's rank was that of a Consul, I applied for the s-ime rank myself and this was sanctioned in the month of July 190 i. My first act here was to look out for a building appropriate for the Con sulate, and this I was lucky in finding before long. A house and garden were bought at a price of 9,000 tomans (roughly about £1,500) and Government sanctioned the further expenditure of a sum of tomans 2,000 for the necessary buildings. Very shortly after my arrival here, the Medical Officer appointed as Con sular Surgeon, Captain 'Williams, I.M.S., for Arabistan and Kermanshah arrived. At the end of August, both Captain Williams (Consular Surgeon) and myself were ordered to proceed to Urumiah on special duty connected with the murder of an American missionary and other outrages committed by the Kurds of that place. Captain Williams returned from Urumiah in the early part of November and at Hamadan, on his way back to Kermanshah received news of the outrage at Khoremabad, whereby Major Douglas, Millitary Attache at Tehran, and Captain Lorimer, Consul at Ahwaz, were severely wounded. Captain Williams at once proceeded to their assistance and gave them the medical assistance of which they stood in need. He then proceeded to Kermanshah, whence again he left for Luristan with His Highness the Earman Earma, Governor of Kermanshah and Luristan to take measures against the Direkwand Lurs, the aggressors in the late attack on Major Douglas and Captain Lorimer. These measures proving entirely abortive. Captain Williams was sent back to Kermanshah, where he arrived early in May. I had myself arrived from Urumiah on the 22nd April 1905, and had again taken up the duties of His Majesty's Consul here. His Highness the Earman Earma remained in Burujird until the end of October 1905, when he returned to Kermanshah. The ten months of His Highness* stay in Luristan46 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL proved not to be much of a success as far as it was intended to punish the Direkwands, as His Highness undertook nothing in the way of reprisals against them, and his only success in capturing thirteen of the principal Mirs o? the section, was effected by what His Highness called ' la haute politique,' which meant that he swore to them on the Koran, assuring them of their perfect safety if they would come in to see him. Oq their coming in, they were at once seized and sent to Kermanshah loaded with chains. The other principal events of the year under report were the small riots in the town and the insecurity in the country round about, Ihe first were caused by the high prices of food. There had been bad harvests for three years in succession, and the rich men of the place had stored their stocks of grain and would not sell until the prices should reach their highest; and in this they were but following the example of His Highness the Farman Parma, who made very large profits out of the prevailing distress. Eiots in the town, and murders in the outskirts of the town were of frequent occurrence, and on one occasion IMr. Robino of the bank was stoned. It was not a very serious affair, and was easily settled by the Deputy Governor of the town. Still, as these small affairs may easily lead to others much more serious, a careful watch had to be kept to see that things did not go beyond bounds. ^ Towards the end of the year, rumours began to spread that His Imperial Highness the Salar-ed-Dowleh was coming as Governor of Kermanshah, and there was so much truth in it, that His Imperial Highness did actually make some efforts to be appointed as the successor of the Tarman Parma, but the affair was arranged so that the Parman Parma was appointed to Kerman, while the Salar-ed-Dowleh was appointed to Luristan. The Salar-ed-Dowleh had previously been Governor of Kermanshah, but his exactions were so heavy that he was removed in response to the appeals made by his victims. There were, therefore, many meetings of those by whose efforts he had previously been removed,—and notably among them, the Imam-i-Jumeb,—and had His Imperial Highness been appointed, all three Consulates would have been full of persons taking ' bast '* or refuge. Early in January, the Hissam-ul-Mulk (since distinguished with the title of Amir-i-Afkham) was appointed to the Governorship of Kermanshah. During the year, there were some small troubles amoogst the tribes, notably among the Pusht-i-Kuh Lurs, where the Vali and his son were fighting against each other, and also in the Kalhor tribe, when the second son of Dacud Khan, the Ilkhani of the tribe, was killed. Otherwise, the tribes have been very quiet. During the year 1904, there was a serious outbreak of cholera in the province and in the town of Kermanshah, one European only, however, dying of it, an employe of the customs. The next year, 1905, was free from cholera, but there was great mortality from a variety of other diseases, chiefly owing to the fact that after three years of insufficient food, the people had not sufficient stamina to withstand any strain on their health. Crops. —The harvest of 1904 was but a poor one, that of 1905 was the same, the barley crop being a failure, and the wheat crop not being up to average. In 1905, too, the ground crops were nearly destroyed by a visitation of locusts, and the fruit, on which the people live for some two or three months of the year, was completely eaten up by the same pest. In consequence, the price of food has steadily increased, all edibles being equally affected. This increase in the cost of food has also increased the cost of all other com modities in the bazaar, and has even had a very disturbing effect on the mport and export trade of the province. Trade. —The figures for the trade of the last three years are as follows:— 1903-04 1904-05 1905-06 Export. £ 193,396 217,664 165,032 Import. £ 894,812 886,949 745,674RESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 47 Other causes besides the cost of living liave, however, helped towards this falling off of trade, as for example, the depreciation in the value of the Kran, the fact that transport has been much more expensive, and much more difficult to get from Baghdad, owing to the fact that the Turkish authorities have seized most of the camels for their expeditions. The increased facilities for transport to the north by the new Russian built road from Kazwin toHamadan has also attracted much of the trade from the Baghdad-Kermanshah route. The following 'is an approximate estimate of the number of loads brought into Kermanshah by the Baghdad route during the last year,—camels, 17,000, mules 69,000, donkeys 15,000. Traffic in arms —The confiscations of arms smuggled into the country according to the Director-General, amounted to— Rifles 32 Double-barrelled guns ....... 6 Cartridges . . .1,600 Revolvers ......... 12 Revolver-cartridges . , ...... 700 Gunpowder, about . . • . , . . , 40 lbs. The above will show that there is not much smuggling in arms done by this route. Customs. —The customs when I arrived here in 1904 were under the charge of Monsieur A. Molitor, with a M. Eabri under him. In 1905, on my return from Urumia, the Director-General was Monsieur Waffelaert, with an assistant. Baron Fallon, This Monsieur WafPelaert was the same gentleman who was removed from Bushire. I am glad to say that he has given no trouble of any sort here, and, indeed, has said that if he were allowed to return to Bushire the Political Resident would find no difficulty whatsoever with him. Baron Pallon retired from the service during the year, and has not been replaced. The Director-General at Kermansliah is also in charge of the Customs of Hamadan, Malayar and Kurdistan. He has, however, so much work at head quarters, especially while he is without an assistant, that he is utterly unable to personally supervise his sub rdinates at the branch offices, with what results may be imagined. All goods coming from Baghdad are sealed at the frontier, and passed on to Kermansbah, where the Customs duties are calculated and in the case of goods for the town, are handed over to the consignees, while goods for other parts of Persia are passed on on payment of the dues. Goods coming from the North are registered at Resht, and do not come into the figures of the Kermanshah Qustoms Keports at all. It is therefore absolutely impossible to get accurate figures for the trade of this province. Not only do the imports from the North not figure at all, but a great deal of the goods that are entered as imported into Kermanshah are really for distribution to other parts of Persia. The Customs are also in charge of the Imperial Treasury at Kermanshah, and meet the expenditure for public buildings and the general administration of the province. The Customs receipts for the last three years for this province are as follows:— Krana. 1903-04 . . * 4,500,000 1904-05 . 4,300,000 1905-06 , , , . , , , , , 3,6U0,000 approxi mately. Prom these receipts are met the expenses of administration, pay of customs officers, furniture, rent of all buildings, repairs, etc. Also all expenses or indemnities ordered by the Central Administration, and the balance is sent through the Russian Bank at Hamadan (with the exception of Krans 10,000 per week paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia here), for transmission to Tehran.48 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Latterly, however, orders were issued that the whole amount should be paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia here, and the latter should pay Tomans 3,000 per week to the Russian Bank at Hamadan.

Bevenue. The revenue (or maliat) registers are issued from Tehran to the Governors of provinces for collection. The revenue is actually collected by the Deputy Governors and paid into ' the Governor, who, after paying (?) the military forces and other Government expenditure, remits the balance to the Imperial Treasury (administered by the customs). After the payment of the political pensions, the balance is sent to Tehran. The revenues collected during the last year are as follows:— Kermanshah Kurdistan Kangavar Asadabad T otal Krans. 451,900 653,000 14,480 22,000 1,041,380 The revenues'of Burujird amounted to krans 334,000, and those of Khore- mabad to krans 457,400. I have not been able to ascertain those of Hamadaa. There is no doubt that the revenues are most unfairly assessed, some villages being very heavily taxed, white some others have never even been brought on to the registers,—the owners paying a bribe to the Governor, and the latter not reporting the existence of the village to the Central Government. This fraud is very common in Kurdistan, the province being more out of the way than Kermanshah. The following is a list of the chief tribes in the Kermanshah province- Name of tribe.

These regiments, however, although nomi nally about 1,000 strong, can very rarely muster more than 300 or so ragged, ill-armed men. My figures above for the number of tents or houses .of the tribes are taken from Persian sources, and in every case would probably be more accurate if divided by two, but unfortunately, I have no means for accurately checking them. Kurdistan. —The principal events in this province during the year have been connected with the Governorship of His Imperial Highness the Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh, who replaced His Excellency the Nasir-ul-Mulk in April 1905. The Salar-ed-Dowleh had previously been Governor of Kermanshah, but had attempted to revolt against the Shah's authority, and had to make his submission at Tehran. He was then given the Governorship of Kurdistan, which, being so far removed from Tehran, is accounted almost banishment. His Imperial Highness's first act on arrival at Senna was to decapitate the Ferash Bashi,—a man who had made a fortune out of his post. He then executed a notorious robber, and, so, having thoroughly frightened everybody, proceeded, according to current rumour, to make as much profit as possible out of the province under his rule. His Imperial Highness caused the degra dation of the hereditary Vizier of Kurdistan, and is said to have taken a very large sum of money fcom him. He also made arrangements with the Jaff tribe, who had been for many years in the habit of coming down from Turkish territory and raiding in the province of Kurdistan, with the result that no repressive measures against them were necessary. In December 1905 His Imperial Highness was appointed to be Governor of Luristan, and was succeeded by His Highness the Jellal-ed-Dowleh, a son of His Imperial Highness the Zil-es-Sultan at Isfahan. Under the Governor of Kurdistan are the Districts of Sakiz and Gerous each with a Deputy Governor. The Governor of Sakiz is the Chief of the Sakizi tribe (Kurds), while the Governor of Gerous is appointed from Senna. Beyond the vagaries of His Imperial Highness, nothing of interest has occurred in the province of Kurdistan during the year under report. The Governor of Hamadan during the last year was the Yamines-Sultan. By far the most powerful person at Hamadan, however, is the Amir-i-Afkham, now Governor of Kermanshah. Hamadan possesses five regiments, three of the Karaguzlu tribe (two belonging to the Amir-i-Afkham, and one to the Zia-ul-Mulk), one of the Buchalu tribe, the property of Abdulla Khan, and one of the Khalaj tribe, the property of one Ahmed Khan. There are also three hundred sowars ; under the orders of the Amir-i- Afkham, and there are a few guns, but no trained Artillerymen to serve them. The guns are mostly antiquated small muzzleloaders. The Russian ' Ban que d'Escompte ' have an Agent at Hamadan, but he has not so far done much business,-T-in fact, from all I hear, the Russian Bank is losing money at Hamadan. The Imperial Bank of Persia have also an Agent at Hamadan, Mr. Oarapet Zohrab, an Armenian. This gentleman very much wishes to be made His Majesty's Vice-Oonsul for Hamadan, but I do not think that there is at present any need for the appointment. The Kazwin-Hamadan road has been finished during the year, but no carriages have been placed upon it. The ' Mehman-Khanehs,' or rest-houses, have been finished, but they are said to contain no conveniences for travellers. There is talk, however, of placing motor cars upon the road, though it is hard to see how they could possibly pay. Hamadan is the headquarters of an American Presbyterian Mission, and schools and a church have been built. Most of the work of these Missionaries lies amongst the Armenians and Jews of whom there are many living in Hamadan. There are also some60 APMINISTEATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GCLP POLITICAL members of the ' Societe Israelite ' working among the Jews. There are also branches of this Society at Kermanshah, Senna, Sakiz and Bijar. Tours. —In October 1905 I visited Senna, Bijar and Hamadan, being most hospitably treated at all three places. At Senna I was much struck by the order and cleanliness of the towc and by the smart appearance of the soldiers in the palace. These may not appear to be very important, but when the state of an ordinary town in Persia is considered, it seems truly wonderful. Everywhere I found that distress, more or less acute, prevailed, though less in the province of Kurdistan than in either Kermanshah or Hamadan, In March 1906 I travelled down to Kasr-i-Shirm by the main pila r i m route. At Kerind I saw some of the rifles manufactured in the town. These rifles are not at all badly turned out, and cost from 20 to 80 Tomans apiece (roughly from Rs. 50 to Rs. 75). At Kasr-i-Shirin I rode out to the oil wells at Chikkar (or Ohiah) Surkh, the property of the d ? Aroy Company. I found the wells guarded by tribes men and everything in good order. The wells were both spouting, though not a very large amount of oil was coming out. The road from Kasr-i-Shirin to Chikkar Surkh consists of about ten miles of good going across undulating plains. The road from Kermanshah to Kasr-i-Shirin is in a shooking condition after every rainfall, though in fine weather it is passable enough, as it lies for the most part across open plains. There is some talk of a Persian Company having been, or being formed to improve this road. It would be a most excellent thing for trade generally if some encouragement could be given to this Company. Any money laid out on the improvement of this road would be a most paying investment, and expense could be easily recouped by rolls, as the traffic is enormous,—this road being the main pilgrim route to Kerbela. The only portion of the road requiring any engineering skill is the pass Ijing between Sar-i-pul and Surkh-i-Dizeb. H. GOUGH, Captaifii His Britanmo Majesty's Consul) Kermanshah. Keemanshah ; The 10th May 1906,RESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 51 C hapter iv.— KEEMAN POLITICAL EEPORT FOE 1905.1906. In - the spring of 1905, Captain Haworth succeeded Major Sykes as British Consul in Kerman. He arriyed in Kerm^n on the 8th May, having fallen in with a small band of robbers near Danlatabad who had recently waylaid a merchant. Tbey did not molest Captain Haworth's party, however. Captain Haworth was struck on his journey with the unconcealed aversion of the country people to their Government and its representatives. The Belgians also appeared to be equally disliked and he was frequently asked if it was true that the English intended to take over the administration of the country. Some local excitement was caused by M. Cessari, Director of Posts and Customs, striking a Persian ^-postal official. The man took refuge with the Imam Juma, but the Governor interfered. In May a certain sum, some Ts. 40,000, was required by the Shah from the Kerman Governor on account of the previous year's arrears of revenue. A difficulty being raised by the Accountant-General in finding the sum without proper security he was dismissed, the Governor appointing his brother, Ain- ul-Mulk, in his place, and one Amir-ul-Umrah, Wazir. _ This latter appoint ment was the original cause of the Sheikhi and Balasiri riots, the results of which mi^-ht well have been more serious than was the case, the new incum bent being a Sheikhi which was considered by the Balasiri Mullahs as an innovation. These Mullahs accordingly closed the bazar amidst general excitement and Amir-ul-Umrah resigned his appointment, a council of five being appoint ed in his place. The disturbances from tbis time, and owing to Balasiris provocation, assumed by degrees more of a religious aspect than a political, and passed out of the control of those originally responsible. The Governor's son, Hashmat-us-Sultan, arrived in Kerman in the end of June 1905, and was appointed Deputy Governor in the place of Ain-ul- Mulk. In July the religious differences between the Balasiris and Sheikhis became more serious and conflicts took place, the head Sheikhi priest with two leading Sheikhi Khans leaving for Tehran. Sarkar Agha was shortly after recalled by the Governor under instructions from Tehran. In the end of August orders were issued that a certain Mosque was to be closed both to Balasiris and Sheikhis. The Sheikhis desisted from using the Mosque, but the Balasiris did not, and they were ejected by the Adil-us-Sultan who ultimately had to seek refuge from the crowd m consequence. The people then went to the Sarkar Agha's house where they were fired on with shot guns. Some troops were called out by the Governor but were not engaged. At this time the Balasiri Mullah, Haji Mirza Mobamed began to obtain an influence with his sect. He is a young man and had come trom Kerbela, his father having occupied a leading place amongst the Balasins. On September 1st Eukn -ud-Dowlah was dismissed and Zafar-us-Sultana appointed in his place. Two incidents in which English gentlemen were insulted by the followers of the Mullah Mohamed Eeza occurred at this time. In one case, the Bank Manager, Mr. Eldrid, was abused for passing the Mullah in the road, and m the other Captain Haworth himself was threatened for not saluting and get ting off his horse on meeting the Mullah. The new Governor-General, His Highness Zafar-us-Sultana, arrived in Kerman on the 7th October 1905 and proceeded at once to strengthen ail guards, and increase the garrison.52 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL His Highness Ain-ul-Mulk was appointed Deputy Governor of Kennan and His Highness Adil-ud-Dowlah, Wazir. These are both brothers to His Highness Eukn-ud-Dowlah. The Mullah Mohamed Eeza had instructed his disciples to destroy certain liquor shops in the bazaar. The owners complained to the Governor who took steps to arrest the offenders. The latter, however, had succeeded in taking bast, or refuge, with the Mujtehid who declined to give them un Troops were then sent who seized the Mullah together with the offenders and took them to the Palace where they were all bastinadoed. The Mullah with his band of hope were then escorted out of Kerman bv Asfandiar Khan, chief of the Buchakchi tribe, and some of his men, and were sent to Rafsinjan. (The chief himself was released from prison on the occasion.) Four men were killed and some more wounded in making the arrest. Two facts were brought to prominent notice in the course of these dis turbances. (1) That the Kermanis are not really fanatically inclined. Thev are a weak and servile population easily led by their mischievous and arrogant priesthood, and as easily dispersed by a show of force, and the power of^the Mullahs themselves is consequently not of a nature to withstand any severe strain put on it. (2) The principle of bast, similarly, could, it appeared, be set aside on occasion without exciting any outburst of popular indignation. As regards this most pernicious system it should perhaps be explained that it constitutes the Consulates, the houses of Mullahs, and in some cases even of European^ private gentlemen and ladies places of temporary refuge for offenders against the laws and customs of their country. On the, 1st November the Sarkar Agha, head of the Sheikhi sect, was grossly insulted while preaching in his Mosque, a donkey arrayed with a turban being pushed amongst the audience. The Agha on the.representation of the Governor left Kerman the next day for Baghin, one march distant. Dissensions arose at this time amongst the Balasiris themselves, their women taking side in the matter. A telegram denouncing the Sheikhis was at this time received from Kerbela, and a meeting was held by the leading men of Kerman at which the Shah and his Government were openly reviled, Uussia being held up to ad miration as a country determined on reform at all costs. The want of leaders in the case of Persia was recognised as fatal. The Governor left for Tehran in the end of November, nominally to see the Shah m person regarding affairs in Kerman, Captain Haworth left for India at the same time, but Colonel Stewart, his successor, was detained both in Bombay and Bunder Abbas, and only reached Kerman on the 10th January one month after he had expected to arrive.

The Perman Eerma arrived in Kerman on the 27th April and was given an unusually cordial reception. He appears to be a very suitable Governor for Kerman, being strong and acting in- a fair manner generally speaking towards the people. He has taken even stronger measures as regards plague precautions than were advocated by Dr. Olemenger, but his methods have so far aroused no opposition. The Kerman-Yezd post was made over to one Mirza Mohammed Khan, who has placed some tarantasses and horses along the road for this purpose and. for the transit of travellers. The Eerman Ferma has made his son Nasrat-ud-Dowlah, Deputy Governor, pending the arrival of the intended incumbent, one Salar-i-Mansur. The Governor of Persian Baluchistan was dismissed in May and replaced by one Asad-ud-Dowlah. Certain changes amongst the officials in charge of sub-disfcricts have also been made, but have no special significance. MISCELLANEOUS, The crops promise extremely well. The administration of justice appears to be severe, but the general state of the district on the arrival of the new Governor was disorganised, and a firm rule much required. The Consular Agent of Bam, Khan Bahadur Asghar Ali, died at Bam on the 11th October 1905. European medical aid being unable to reach him in time. He was attended by a Persian Hakim from whose report it would appear that the cause of death was pleurisy. M. Cattersole, Director of Customs, was transferred to Seistan, Mr. Yantze, an Armenian, being appointed in his place in October 1905. A sample room of English and Indian manufactures in cloth, etc., was started in the Bazar, but has met with no success until now, the subsidies and remissions of duty granted by the Russian Government in aid of their trade in chintze and other cheap commodities rendering competition in this direction futile. The Sarkar Agha died in April 1906 at Langar near Mahun, and no priest of sufficient ability or influence is available amongst the Sheikhis to fill his place. The sect is comparatively of recent introduction into Kerman having as its founder the son of Haji Ibrahim Khan, Zahil-ud-Dowlah, by name Haji Kariin Khan (father of the late Sarkar Agha), who brought the creed from Kerbela. A Russian merchant arrived at Kerman in June 1905, from Ispahan with numerous patterns of chintzes. He was taken in hand by M. Miller but was not received with much enthusiasm by the Hindus. He, however, received an order for Ts. 20,000 worth of chintz which has since been executed and a fresh order received. His coming has in fact been attended with more actual success than the much advertised mission of Prince Amatuni. The following robberies took place during the year in the district :— (1) That of the merchant mentioned above in this report. The man stated that he had been robbed of some jewelry he was bringing for sale, three mules, property in all to the amount of Rs. 3,676. (2) An Afghan travelling from Meshed to Bunder Abbas was murdered and his goods, valued at Ts. 1,949, looted. (3) Some Pathans, British subjects, were robbed of their goods, valued at Ts. 1,020. (4) Two robberies occurred in Eebruary 1906, at caravanserais in the city, some silks and carpets being stolen, and a third similarly in March when some Ts. 250 were stolen.54 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL (5) Some donkeys were stolen from a caravan at Baghin at the same time. (6) A robbery in which some goods of Messrs. Sassoon were looted from a caravan is under reference to Bush ire and another similarly to Yezd, in which a Hindu was concerued, the place of the thefts being under dispute. KERMAN BOUNDARIES. It should be understood that the actual limits of the Kerman and Persian Baluchistan districts have never been precisely defined, and that the same remark applies to the sub-districts which they include. The northernmost point of the Kerman district is said to be a place called Shims, two marches south-west of Yezd on the Yezd-Kerman road. The salt lake marked Kavir on the maps (dry in summer), constitutes the western boundary as far as Saidabad of Kerman whence the line appears to follow the trade route through Dashtab and Daulatabad of Kerman as far as Pur Ahmedi. The line thence continued southwards follows the western boundaries of the Budbar district to Minab and from there coincides with the western and southern coast line of the Bashkard district. The southern boundary continues to follow the coast line of the Geh sub-district to Gwattar. On the east from Koh-i-Malik Siah to Gwattar the boundaries of Persian and British Baluchistan are conterminous, and from Koh-i-Malik Siah the line would so far as can be ascertained be drawn due West to Nasratabad (Sipi). Thence it follows the trade route to Bam, and from Bam north-west the eastern boundary would correspond with that of the Khabis and Kuh-benan sub-districts. The want of any exact delimitation of the frontier lines of sub-districts, districts, and their adjacent provinces is unfortunate but more so perhaps from an academic than a practical point of view. Pew if any cases of disputed internal lines of demarcation occur at any rate and the amount of suspicion which would be excited, and local dissensions created by our taking action in the matter would I think be quite disproportionate to any possible advantages to be gained.

General Remarks. —At tlie outset it may be observed that tbe district now under report has not hitherto been noted upon separately from the usual Annual Report of the Persian Gulf Residency. It will therefore be advisable to mention here that during the latter part of 1904 the status of the Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Bunder Abbas was raised to that of Consul and his jurisdiction extended to include the following ' Bunder Abbas, Shamilat, Lingah and Minab with the Shibkuh ports (as far as Mugam on the west), all the islands belonging to Persia in the eastern part of the Persian Gulf and the coast of Persia eastwards as far as Gwetter.' The extent of country is very considerable and can be thoroughly supervised only by constant touring', facilities for which are at present rather difficult of arrangement. At the same time during the period under report the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, remains ex-officio Political Officer for the Mekran Coast and hitherto the Assistant Resident at Bunder Abbas has had notliing to do with districts east of Micab, beyond the registration of British subjects residing at the Telegraph Stations on that coast. Rainfall and harvest have been fairly good, though forecasts of scarcity were made and the opportunity taken to prohibit the export of cereals. The year has been marked especially by the collection of information for the new Persian Gulf Gazetteer, the linking up of Bunder Abbas with the rest of the world by telegraph and the establishment of a Russian Consulate at the port. Changes in Local authorities. —These unfortunately continue to be so very frequent that the work of the Assistant Resident is greatly hampered by long and frequent repetitions of the same cases or subjects to succeeding officials all of whom being aware of the probable shortness of their stay endeavour to evade doing anything definite throughout the time of their office. The result is a large and over-growing number of pending matters, the ultimate solution of which becomes more and more difficult and less and less likely with each succeeding official. Haji Mahomed Khan (a half-brother of His Excellency the Daria Begi) was Deputy Governor up to the 10th May 1905, having been appointed to the post just six months previously. He was replaced by Safar Ali Khan, who was himself replaced again by the Daria Begi's half-brother, Haji Mahomed Khan, on the 23rd December 1905 ; the latter has continued in office up to date. The Karguzari has continued in the hands of Mirza Abdullah, Midhat- tQ-'Wazara, who has not distinguished himself by any more readiness to assist this Consulate than that displayed during the past four years of his tenure of the post. The Director of Customs has throughout the period under report been Monsieur A. Stas, a Belgian. A change in the Deputy Governorship of Lingah took place early in July 1905 as the result of the representations of this Consulate, when Haji Talib Khan was exiled and replaced by Mirza Ismail Khan, a former Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas. He continued to hold office until he too was replaced by Safar Ali Khan, mentioned above, on the 25th March 1906. There is no Karguzari at Lingah. The Director of Customs at Lingah throughout the year has been Monsieur J. Bourgeois. Shamilat has been under the rule of the Kalantar Assadullah Khan except for a short interregnum of about two months during April and May 1805.58 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL In Minab Kerbelai ^ Mabomed Hassan has continued as Deputy- Governor during the period of this report. He is a nominee of the Moin-nt- Tujar and has always shown himself as very well-disposed towards this consulate. Hormuz and Kishm Islands have remained under the charge of the Kalanter Mirza Khalil and the Sheikh Hassan respectively, also both nominees of the Moin-ut-Tujar. Attitude of Persian officials.—It may be noted here that the attitude of the local Persian officials is rendered so apathetic, if not actually hostile, by their venality that it becomes exceedingly difficult for the British representa tive to bring about satisfactory settlements in the cases of claims preferred by British subjects as well as in other matters of some political importance. [Fraudulent bankruptcy, connived at by the local authorities, is not unknown, the plea of abject poverty when raised is generally supported by them and action, whenever possible, is delayed in order to enable the defendant, absconder or accused to escape into the interior, when the plea of want of jurisdiction is put forward and no course remains but reference to one authority after another, a process which may be continued for years without any real definite result. I mention the above as the interests affected are almost entirely those of our British Indian subjects, who have been the pioneers of our influence in this part of Persia. Tuhlic Peace and TrmqmtUty.-~'Lootmg of caravans has not been so bad as in former years, though during April 1905 two caravans were looted near Ahmadi on the Kerman road, a favourite place for such depredations, lying as it does on the border of the Fars and Kerman provinces. During May some apprehension was caused in the country north of Bunder Abbas owing to the presence of one Kal Siraj, a late Kalantar of Pinn who having been ejected from that post wandered about the Shamil district for some time with a following of about a hundred men ; he did not however commit any serious damage. In August his followers visited the Assistant Resident's camp at Ginao village, but beyond volunteering the information that knowing the camp was that of the British Consul and that for that reason they had no intention of looting it, they did nothing. On the 19th March 1906 a party of 15 persons with whom were vtbree sowars of the Kerman Consular escort relief were held up near Baghu 15 miles from Bunder Abbas and stripped of everything they possessed. Partial satisfaction for this outrage has already been obtained, and it is hoped that the local authorities will eventually, after the usual pressing, compensate the Indian Government by paying the value of the remaining articles taken and not returned. • ;i • ; t In December 1905 an affray took place between some customs officials and villagers at Kolat-i-Bala in which 4 men were wounded, of whom one sub sequently died. At Lingah a serious incident occurred in which certain Laris and Girashis to the number of nearly 100 surrounded the house of the British Agent and there caused a riot. Afterwards they, continued to surround the house, but quietly, alleging that they desired to complain against the British Agent's action in the settlement of a case of the bankruptcy of a Hindu and had therefore taken bast ' under the British flag which flew over the Agent's house. The incident was engineered by a notorious mischief-maker, Haji Ali Lad, who managed either to overawe or to cajole the Deputy Governor sufficiently to take his side and identify himself with the rioters. r lhe incident necessitated several visits of His Majesty's Consul to the spot and eventually after 17 days the crowd was dispersed, the Deputy Governor deposed and both Haji Ali Lari and the Deputy Governor (Haji Talib Khan) exiled from Lingah. An attempt was subsequently made to get this sentence against both the men rescinded, but this was fortunately frustrated. The sentence and the manner in which it was enforced bad a most beneficial effect not only in Lingah but along the whole coast from Mugam to Minab in the re-assertion of British prestige. Fuhlic Health and Quarantine.—The whole district has been fortunate in not having suffered from any serious epidemic, either of cholera or plague,RESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 59 « though both diseases have occurred fairly close. Pever has been prevalent as usual and sufferers from guinea-worm at Bunder Abbas were more than usually numerous during May and June 1905. There have been constant difficulties over quarantine matters between the British Quarantine Medical Officer and the Director of Customs, brought about by thelatter's persistent attempts to interfere in such matters as of a right, though they lay entirely without his province. Happily it was possible to arrange matters at Bushire with the Director-General of Customs which definitely removed all possible excuse for the Director's interference since when the quarantine arrangements have run smoothly. The Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year has been Assistant Surgeon W. H. K. Brumley, I.S.M.D. A charitable dispensary was sadly required at Bunder Abbas owing to the large numbers there are of the very poor. One was opened under the charge of the Quarantine Medical Officer in March 1906 and does an immense amount of good in relieving suffering, apart from the political influence which such institutions always bring in their train in Persia. Customs Administration. —Since the issue of the Eeglement Douanier in September 190i, many points which at first caused friction or difficulties have now been smoothed away by some authoritative ruling or the tacit understand ing which acknowledges that certain articles of this document are impossible of execution ; consequently the Belgian officials and their subordinates now do not seriously inconvenience or surprise traders with new and startling innovations issued without notice, and though the present administration of Customs is no more popular now than it was at first, it has assumed a more workable character. Some old cases which were pending between this Consulate and the Customs were successfully brought to a conclusion. I regret to report that the pernicious Hamal-Bashi system still obtains and the present incumbent of the post continues to exercise the same unwholesome influence over the Director, which has been the subject of reports before. He is the Director's right hand, employed on any work; under him, however shadowy its connection with the legitimate duties of even a Customs Department may be, whilst the Hamal-Bashi's proper sphere is supposed to be confined really to the unloading, loading and delivery of merchandise at the Customs-House and jner. &gt; Arms Traffic. —The vigilance of the Customs authorities has effectually suppressed the arms traffic in the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas and Lingah. The import of arms and ammunition, however, continues freely along the Mekran Coast and on that between Bushire and Lingah. Some captures have been made by the Customs authorities, but their total amount must represent only a, very small proportion of the numbers successfully introduced into the country. Prom all the information which I have received it would appear that these imports are not destined for the North-West frontier of India as is generally supposed. An excellent market and a muph nearer one exists in the Kerman province, in the districts round Seistan, in Laristan and also in Persian Baluchistan. Some undoubtedly do reach the frontiers of India and that only by Way of Herat, a route which, considering the risks run, must make the arms which do eventually arrive at the Indian frontier of very considerable value. The state of unrest at present prevalent throughout Persia makes the possession of arms by every villager a precautionary measure if not a necessity, and which one can hardly blame him for taking in view of the constant oppression and exactions to which he is subjected by every so-called official, however petty he may be. Slave Trade.— direct slave-dealing appears to take place actually in Bunder Abbas or its immediate vicinity, though slaves frequently take refuge at the Consulate on the plea that their masters wish to transfer them (at a price) to some one else. 1 have heard, however, from native sources, that in Persian Baluchistan owing to hard times and short commons, it has become not unusual for parents and relatives to sell their younger children60 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GU^F POLITICAL * — and other relations, male and female, to a few men who work their export to the Arab Coast. One notorious dealer in Biyaban district and Persian Baluchistan is Mir Barkat Khan ; the children are supposed to be shipped by twos and threes in native boats from the small Mekran Coast ports. It is reported that these children are most carefully coached beforehand to abscond the moment that they are ill-treated to one of our Consulates or Agencies and there claim their freedom. The following tabular statement gives the numbers manumitted at this Consulate, or through its good offices. The figures shown against Lingah are of those who have taken refuge at the British Agency there and whose cases have now to be referred to this Consulate for the grant of manumission papers. Place.

Telegraph. —The most important event of the year was the connection by telegraph of Bunder Abbas with the rest of the world, the work being carried out by the Indo-European Telegraph Department for the Persian Govern ment. On the 14th October 1905 the I. G.T. S. Fatric Stewart laid the first section of the cable across the strait between H^njam Island and Deristan on the south side of Kishm Island, and then, after dropping material for the land line across Kishm Island at Suza, she arrived at Kishm town on the 16tb October. On the following day the vessel came over to Bunder Abbas and laid the cable from Bunder Abbas to Kishm joining up with the shcre-end at Kishm, laid on the previous day, late in the afternoon. Work on the land- line across Kishm Island and on the various cable-houses was pushed forward until the line was complete from the Henjam Station to the cable house at Bunder Abbas, when for the first time through connection over the wire with Henjam became possible on the evening of the 31st December 19C5. Subsequently it was found advisable to shift the cable-house further inland ; on this work being undertaken on the 19th January 1906, and partially carried out, it was forcibly stopped by the local authorities two days later, without any definite orders and apparently on the initiative and at the instiga tion of M. Stas, the Director of Customs, No reference was made to the British Consulate or to the Telegraph Superintendent in charge of the work; after considerable telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty's Charg^ d Affaires at Tehran the matter remained in abeyance until the 12th March 1906 when the Persian authorities without any previous intimation suddenly commenced works on a new Telegraph Office on a most unsuitable site within a few yards of the condemned cable-house and directly across the intended line of the cable. In spite of urgent local protests and the assurances of the Central Government at Tehran to His Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires work was continued well into April when it eventually stopped as the result of British representations. There is only too good reason to believe that the insistence and energy with which work was continued by the Director ofRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 61 Customs (under whose auspices the building was being erected) was due in a great measure to the support, moral, if not actual, of my Russian colleague. The position therefore now is that, though connection is complete, no office has yet been opened to the public owing to the childish objections of the Persian Government. Tours. —In connection with the collection of information for the new Persian Gulf Gazetteer a fair amount of touring was done at the beginning of 1905, the Assistant Resident making one tour in February of the Islands of Hormuz, Larak and Henjam. Early in March another tour was made by way of the main caravan route to Kerman through fehamilat, south to Minab, and back to Bunder Abbas. In April a tour westwards into Bastak territory, south to Khamir with a visit to Bassidu and back to head-quarters. In August a tour northwards in search of a possible summer resort was made, but though Kuh-i-Ginao and the foot-hills of Kuh-i-Parghun were visited no suitable place was found. The thermometer between 9 a.m . and 6 p.m . during this tour usually averaged about 105° Parenheit or more, even at an altitude of 2,700 feet. Navy and Marine, —His Excellency Eear-Admiral Atkinson Willes in the flagship Hyacinth and accompanied by His Majesty's Bedhreast and Proserpine visited Hormuz in the course of his annual tour in April 1905, but did not call actually at Bunder Abbas. His successor in the command of the East Indies Squadron, Vice-Admiral Sir Edmund Poe, visited Bunder Abbas in March of the following year, remaining in port two days in His Majesty's Ship Hermes. In addition to the above-named vessels His Majesty's Ships Fox and Sphinx visited the port at various times. The E. I. M. S. Lawrence and the I. G. T. S. Fatric Stewart with the Political Resident and the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs also called during the tours of these officers. No foreign vessels of war entered the port. Foreign Representatives.— to the 14th Pebruary 1906 Russia had been represented by a Consular Agent, in the person of a Persian by name Mahomed Ali the Sadid-us-Sultaneh. On this date the first Russian Consul for Bunder Abbas, Monsieur G. Owseenko, arrived from Russia via Meshed, Seistan, Kerman and Regan and was accorded a very cordial and ceremonious official reception. It was not, however, until a month after his arrival that the Czar's representative officiallv informed his British colleague of his appointment to Bunder Abbas. M. Owseenko is well-known throughout Persia, having estab lished the Russian Consulate at Bushire and served at Baghdad and Seistan. No other power is represented at this port. At Lingah a Persian represents Prance as Consular Agent ; and to another Persian, Mahomed bin Abdulah Khwajah, whom the Persian Government refuses to recognise, are entrusted Turkish interests. Lieutenant W.H.I. Shakespear, LA., has held charge of the office of Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul throughout the year. Agha Badr bin Mahomed Amin has also continued in charge of the British .Agency at Lingah during the same period. W. H. 1.

This stretcb. of Coast-line whicli includes the districts of Biyaban, Jask, Gaih, Dashtyari and Bahu, has since November 1904 been placed, so far as the exercise of Consular powers is concerned, within the sphere covered by the Commission of His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Assistant Eesident at Bunder Abbas; but that officer has not so far been in a position to exercise anv practical supervision further east than Minab, as will be seen from the nreface to his Administration Report; and meanwhile the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and ex-officio Political Officer for the Mekran Coast, has, as hitherto, dealt with our interest as regards the tract through which the Gwadur-Jask land telegraph line passes. The observations which tollow witn regard to Jask, Gaih, Dashtyari and Bahu are based on the reports ot the Director Mr. Wbitby Smith and his Assistants, while the westernmost district, Bivaban, lying between Jask and Minab, is treated of by the light of notes recorded bv Lieutenant E. L. Birdwood, Second Assistant to the Resident, who traversed the country for the purpose of collecting information for the Gazetteer now under preparation. The several divisions are taken in geographical order from the north west to the south-east. BIYABAJ^. The details of boundaries in these unsettled districts are liable to vary so much according to the degree ot eilective Boundaries. control or influence exercised by their petty Mirs that it is difficult to arrive at any authoritative exposition of them which will remain reliable for long. With this reservation it may be said that on the north and west the boundary of Biyaban marches with that of Mmab and that the most southern village at present under Mmab is Ziarat, from the south of which village Biyaban commences. On the south the boundary lies between the Biyaban village of Bunji and the Jask village of Kuh-i-Mubarak. The natives of Biyaban are all Balucbis of Sunni persuasion and chiefly of tc B ais' stock, and are practically inhabitants. uninfluenced by the politics of Persia proper. They are extremely ignorant and poor, eking out a precarious existence from the produce of their meagre date and gram cultivation, of which they only grow sufficient for their own requirements, selling any surplus they may have to the coast villages where cultivation is not possible. There are two routes through Biyaban in ordinary use, bifurcating at Kalawi in the Minab district and meet- Conamunications. in g a ^ a i n after passing through Biyaban at Ganean in the Jask Division. The track nearest the sea is known as the ' Sea Eoad ' (Eah-i-Darya) and the inner one as the Hill Hoad (KaJa-x- Kuh). The latter is very often impassable in winter owing to floods. The administration of the district, so far as any exists, is conducted by a Deputy Governor m the person ot one ot Administration.

The latter gone to Bushire to interview the Derya Begi m October 190o and to have obtained to the Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas (His Excellency ^ brother) and presumably having paid more than Mir Eaikat, obtained64 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT ON THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL recognition also, as Deputy Governor of Bijaban. The two kinsmen were fighting the issue out among themselves when the year closed. The politics of Biyaban are inseparable from those of the Jask districts both having been formerly ruled by the common ancestor of the two Mirs abovementioned. The seat of Government in the case of Mir Haji has been always at Sirrig, and that of Mir Barkat at Naamurdi. Under the circumstances above described it is not surprising that Biyaban possesses a chronic reputation for lawlessness. Persian Customs representatives are posted at Sirrig, Briz, Sarkand and Bunji: points of observation, under the supervision of the Mudir of Minab. JASK DISTRICT. The Jask district is controlled by the brother of Mir Barkat above- mentioned, Mir Mustapha Khan bin General. Abdul Nabi, who is regarded as the paramount Chief, and his distant cousin Mir Boti bin Mir Ali, the latter being specially responsible between Jask and the Jagin river, and the former from Jagin to the Sadeeh river, which forms the eastern boundary of the district. Mir Mustapha Khan and his younger brother Mir Barkat are also in charge of the country, west of Jask to Kuh-i-Mubarek. The general condition of the district has been peaceful, no disturbances having occurred during the year, and no damage done to the line. GAIH DISTRICT. The Chief of this large district, Sardar Said Khan, has not travelled south during the year, but sent his nephew General * Sardar Islam Khan to collect taxes from the minor chiefs and headmen, who one and all complain of oppression and of the exorbitant taxes demanded. The population continues to decrease on account of this overbearing oppression, and the tax money demanded from each remaining individual naturally increases. Sardar Said Khan on his nart must meet the annual payment to the Persian Government at Bampur which can only be done bv looting and overtaxation, and at the cost of driving out the inhabitants, and the gradual ruin of the country. The rapid decrease of the population is particularly marked by the great number of bunded fields not in cultivation. The condition of the country has been peaceful and no damage has been done to the line during the year. The district of Gaih is split up into many minor districts, the Chiefs and headmen of which are subsidized, but as this data is contained in many previous reports, only those sub-districts which call for special remarks are touched upon. The headmen of this sub-district Mir Sy dull ah is an imbecile. Early in the year he went to Maskat where he was Bir sub -district. arrested by His Highness the Sultan for the supposed murder of a slave and was handed over to the Persian authori ties at Bushire for punishment. He was released some months after and has since returned to his district. The management was for a time controlled by his uncle Sahib Khan, but this gentleman declines further assistance unless he is given the Govern ment subsidy or part of -it. Mir Sydullah has a son, Sheroo, who is only a boy of ten but arrangements could probably be made with the uncle Sahib ^ Khan to undertake the control of the Bir district until this boy attains his majority. Mir Sydullah's subsidy of Es. 200 for the year ending the 31st December 1905 has been paid with his authority to Sahib Khan, who is now carrying on the work of the district.EESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 65 This sub- district was up to t\ie beginning of the year in charge of the Hot Pakir Mahomed, who received an annual Parsg sub-district. subsidy of Rs. 150. Hot Pakir Mahomed seems to have courted the displeasure of his chief Sardar Said Khan, who early in the year deprived him of the Customs at Pussum Bunder (near Oharbar) and appointed a man named Lusljari. It was reported in December that Hot Takir Mahomed out of jealousy murdered his rival Luskari, and decamped with his family and belongings to the Arab Coast. Hot Pakir Mahomed's telegraph subsidy for the half-year ending the 31st December had not been paid up to the end of the year, and as he is not likely to return to the Mekran, it will be necessary to appoint another headman of the Para 0, sub-district. An application has been made to the telegraph authorities by one Hot Lulla, a relative of Hot Fakir Mahomed's, who repre sents himself as the acknowledged head and has promised to look after the district and the interests of the Telegraph Department. His title to a subsidy is under consideration. The Afghan commonly known as Kalipha, but whose real name appears to be Khair Mahomed, is the centre and figurehead of the arms traffic between Maskat and the Mekran ports of Sadech, Galeg and Tank. Kalipha resides at Kerwan (15 miles north-west of Rapch) where he is much respected as a high priest and has a considerable following of Afghans. Some of these Afghan retainers are sent to Maskat to buy rifles and ship them secretly, while others on this side scour the country for transport of camels, Sardar Said Khan must be cognizant of this smuggling of arms, and it is rumoured that lie receives a fee of two dollars on each rifle landed. The number of rifles imported during the year (1904-1905) is estimated at three thousand with one hundred rounds of ammunition to each gun. This year early in January His Majesty's Ship Redbreast called at Galeg and probably this fact put Kalipha on his guard as he was subsequently reported to have informed his Maskat buyers to suspend all shipments. The periodical passage of gunboats across to the arms smuggling ports undoubtedly act as an excellent deterrent for the time being. The chief exports of Gaih are dates and Mekrani rice which are grown in abundance in the north. Ghee is also Products o ai . exported from Charbar, and recently sheep have been shipped to the Arab Coast where they command good prices. Barley, jowari and cotton are cultivated in smaller quantities, most of which is con sumed and used in the country. Grazing for cattle is fairly abundant. DASHTYARI DISTRICT. The Dashtyari District is administered jointly by the brothers Mir Abdi Khan and Mir Mahmud Khan who are Genera1, responsible for an annual payment of about ten thousand rupees to the Persian Government, through Sardar Said Khan of Gaih. The latter has gone on pilgrimage and the former has been comparatively well behaved throughout the year. Mir Abdi Khan has a bad reputation for constantly looting the property of telegraph servants and British protected subjects, but no outrages have been reported during the year. It seems evident that both the brottiers are well liked by the inhabitants, and they treat their subjects with consideration and much better than the chiefs of the adjoining districts. No damage has been done to the line during the year. Dashtyari to the north of Khaki Koh is very fertile. Its chief exports are cotton, barley and dhall. The revenue Products of Dashtyari. derived by the export of last year's cotton is estimated at one lakh and a half of rupees, while barley and dhall are said to have produced half a lakh each.66 ADMINISTRATION BEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL BAHU DISTRICT. This district, which has recently been in a state of disorder, is jointlv under the control of Mir Ashraf Khan * and Mir Ahmed Khan, who are respon, sible to the Persian Government at Bampur for an annual payment of about six thousand rupees, nothing of which bas been paid for some years. I n September last they were commanded to Bampur to explain the non -payment of their debts. Here, I believe, Mir Ahmed Khan negotiated a scheme by which he guaranteed to collect the necessary money, and Mir Ashraf Khan was detained as security. Shortly after Mir Ahmed Khan's return, it was reported that three hundred camels had been looted by him at Paleiri, a place situated in His Highness the Sultan of Maskat's territory, about 26 miles from Gwadur. Most of the camels looted belonged to the Latti tribe who were formerly resident in Bahu and subjects of Mir Ahmed Khan, but they left about three years ago on account of his overbearing oppression and settled at Paleiri with the Sultan's permission. It appears that on the arrival of the Political Officer sent to investigate the case, Mir Ahmed Khan was induced to return some of the camels, but there is still a deficiency of about two hundred, of which twenty-eight belong to telegraph servants. Mir Ahmed Khan's next escapade was undertaken early in February last, when he looted a former subject of his named Mir Sheikh Dost Mahomed, a wealthy and influential man who is also described as a high priest. Mir Sheikh Host Mohamed like many others left the Bahu district about a year ago on account of constant persecution, and settled in Hashtyari where he was well received. Early in February Mir Ahmed Khan went to Hashtyari and begged him to return, promising he would not be molested and many other fictitious promises with the result that Mir Sheikh Dost Mahomed was eventually induced to return to Bahu. But directly he had settled he was treacherously looted by Mir Ahmed Khan who'captured two of his sons whom he holds for a ransom of two thousand rupees. After this incident Mir Ahmed Khan took refuge in Bahu Kalat with a following of about twenty men, and Mir Sheikh Dost Mahomed was busily engaged collecting a small army to attack him, but it has recently transpired that an amicable agreement has been arranged. It is supposed that this is merely feint on the part of Mir Ahmed Khan, whose scheme now is to capture Mir Sheikh Dost Mahomed himself and confiscate all his property. The country is in a most deplorable condition and practically nothing has been sown this year. The depopulation, which has been going on for years, has now reached its lowest ebb, the only people remaining being a few Hots and headmen with their relatives and slaves. It must be considered fortunate that no damage has been done to the line this year. The rainfall throughout all the districts dealt with has been abundant Eaill £ all an d this year's crops should be exception ally productive. In February a large extent of country between Rodi and the Dasht river, approximately 500 square miles, was in flood, which was mainly attributable to mouthless rivers emptying themselves about 15 miles north of Gwetter. This huge overflow is entirely wasted as the soil here is salty and perfectly useless for cultivation. The inhabitants say they have not had a similar flood for the past fifteen years, nor such a quantity of rain as has lately fallen, and which appears to have been general throughout the country between Jask and Gwadur. It is a fact beyond doubt that throughout the hinterland of Persian Slave Traffic. Mekran, slaves are constantly being , , . Ti. .. , bought and sold, the men being em ployed m cultivating and tending camels while the women become domestic servants. The local officials of the Telegraph Department think howeverEESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 67 that during the year under report the trafiic to Oman and the Trucial Coast has been to a great extent discontinued. This is probably due in some measure to the fact that certain of the Mirs who are the chief supporters of the traffic have been too busy with their own dissensions, and perhaps deterred by the warnings of Telegraph officials. The Persian Government have not sufficient control in this distant quarter of the Shah's dominions to put down the traffic, even if the inclina tion to do so were present. As a matter of fact it is to the direct interest of local Governors and officials that the trade should continue to flourish, and judging from the large numbers of Mekranis to be found on the Trucial Coast, actually or practically in a state of slavery, it is to be feared that any suspen sion of the traffic which there may have been lately is unlikely to be enduring. The cause of the connection of the Mirs and headmen with the export is not far to seek. It is often impossible that they can pay the over-assessed revenue demands of the Persian Government and its insatiable local Governors, from the legitimate income of their districts ; and the cash proceeds of the sale of slaves either captured in raids or received from their relations in lieu of revenue, are obviously a simple and convenient means of making up shortage. As long as the administrative machinery of the Persian Government remains what it is, so long will slavery inevitably thrive. P. Z.

During the year under review mora inter-tribal disputes and unsettling ' , &lt; p .... events have taken place in Oman than Internal Politics. usual) tbe Sultan has ^ occasions been put to anxiety and expense in consequence. Early in June, the Makabil ( ) a lawless and Makabil rebellion. — .. , „ ' TT . predatory tribe of the Hmavian branch dwelling in the hills west of Suhar ( ) on the Batinah ( «ukj ) coas ^ giving as their reason discontent with the rule of the Governor-General Sheikh Sulaiman bin Suwailim, began to make themselves unpleasant and about the 15th of the month plundered the suburbs of Suhar and killed one of the inhabitants, Tbey followed this up with another excursion of a similar nature on the 27th idem, but on this occasion were met by the garrison, commanded by Sulaiman's son in his father's absence, and were repulsed, not however before they had captured eight camels which were not subsequently recovered Muzaffir bin Sulaiman, the Governor-General's son, was wounded in this encounter. About the middle of July the Makabil again attacked the fort of Suhar the garrison of which had been reinforced, and killed the 'Akid or chief constable and two men. They were repulsed after a sharp fight. It now became necessary to teach this tribe a lesson, and Sulaiman bin Suwailim was despatched from Maskat with orders to capture the fort and village of Hilti ( ) 4 0 miles from Suhar which had hitherto been in their possession. The Maka.bil were at this time joined by a neighbouring tribe, the A1 bu Shamis ( J] ) and His Highness the Sultan in retaliation arrested at Burka one of the principal Sheikhs of the A1 bu Shamis and imprisoned him in Maskat where he shortly afterwards died. Meanwhile Hilti was captured by Sulaiman with the help of the Bani Said ( Ji,) and Bani 'Ali ( ^ ) who had been subsidised for the purpose, and the rebellious tribes after one or two fruitless attempts to retake it retired to the hills where they have since remained quiet. Sulaiman returned ta JVlaskat where on his arrival he was received with a salute of eleven guns as a mark of the Sultan's satisfaction at the successful result of his operations. The movements of Sheikh 'Isa bin Salih A1 Harthi (to whom a reference Sheikh 'Isa bin Salih Al Harthi. is J earl y in tllese reports) were a cause ot some anxiety during the late summer and autumn. Early m August it was rumoured that he intended to Visit Samayil, ostensibly with the object of reconciling the Siyabiyin ( ^ tL) . * tribe and the Bani Euwahah ( ) between whom difficulties had arisen; but it was generally thought that his object was more likely to be connected with intrigue at Rustak ( ^ ) against the Wali Said bin Ibrahim. On September 13th a letter to the Sultan arrived from Sheikh 'Isa in which the latter asked His Highness' permission to visit Samayil at the end of the current month, and by the same messenger the Sheikh returned to His Highness, m accordance with a request made to him previously bv Saiyid Timur, a valuable sword which had been plundered from Maskat during the investment of the town by the Hinavi rebels in 1895. The Sultan saw no reason to refuse this request of Sheikh 'Isa, and sent the Governor of Mattrah, Saiyid Mahammad bin Mamad, to Samayil to meet him. The Sheikh arrivedRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 69 at Samayil on the 8th October with about 400 followers of his own and other Hinavi tribes, and at once despatched to Maskat Abdallah bin Hamaid As Salimi, a well-known Matawwa priest, with 25 men to visit His Highness. This party were hospitably entertained until the 13th when the majority returned to Samayil, the Salimi himself remaining in Maskat which he quitted for • the pilgrimage to Mecca shortly afterwards. Sheikh 'I^a succeeded in establishing the reconciliation above referred to, and on the 16th October sent a message to the Sultan begging to be allowed to visit him personally. His Highness after consultation with the Political Agent replied that there was no objection provided that he came with a few followers only. Distrust on the part of Sheikh 'Isa prevented his accepting these terms, and be then wrote to Sheikh Zaid bin Khalifah of Dibai who happened to be in Maskat at the time asking him to intercede with the Suit m on his behalf. His Highness could not change his views as to the escort, but he sent Sheikh 'Isa a present of $400 as a proof of sincerity. The meeting however did not come off, and the Hartbi after a quiet sojourn in Samayil, set out for his own country on the 12th November, the greater portion of his retinue having dispersed in the meantime. As usual quarrels occurred occasionally between the Maawalis and the people of Nakhal. None of them were of Naklial - serious import, however, and each was settled by a truce of more or less duration. At the time of writing they appear to be on terms of mutual forbearance if nothing more satisfactory. The most serious difficulty of the year, which has not in fact yet been brought to a conclusion, has been occa- Revolt of the Earn Riyam. sioned by lawlessness on the part of the Bani Eiyam ( ^ ), a numerous and influential tribe inhabiting the s * ^ ' ' neighbourhood of the Jabal Akhdar ( ) range, and Ziki ( ) arid Nizwa ( Jj}* ) in Oman proper. During the autumn some men of this tribe having caught a member of the Sultan's garrison, sold him as a slave to some Bedouins, and in revenge the Governor imprisoned a son of the Eiyami Sheikh Nasir bin Majid. Pinding that ihey could not induce the Governor to release this person, the tribe broke into revolt and about the 20th December killed two men of the A1 bu Said (^ jl), the tribe to which ✓ the reigning house belongs, and announced their intention of besieging Ziki. His Highness the Sultan on hearing of these occurrences despatched the indefatigable Sulaiman bin Suwailim, who had recently returned from his successful campaign against the Makabil, with stores of food and ammunition for the garrison. Sulaiman on arrival at Samayil at first found it impossible to proceed further owing to the sympathy of the Bani Jabir ( ^ ^ ) and other Ghafiri tribes with the Riyamis, and the consequent difficulty of obtain ing help from them in the matter of transport. Eventually, after remaining inactive for a month, he received assistance from the Bani Ruwahah, and reached Ziki late in [February where he found that the fort was still hold ing out although the garrison were in distress on account of the exhaustion of their stores and ammunition. Meanwhile, the Sultan had arranged^ for the arrest and imprisonment at Maskat of certain Sheikhs of the Bani Riyam and had moreover taken measures to block the commercial dealings of the rebellious tribe with the ports of Maskat and Mattrah. Sulaiman on arrival at Ziki at once tried to arrange a settlement upon the following terms :— (1) The return to His Highness the Sultan of Birkat-ul-Mauz () a large and flourishing village about six miles west of Ziki. (2) The payment to the Bani Biyam by His Highness of $7,000, and (3) The release by His Highness of his prisoners. To these terms the rebels would not agrae neither would they accept a suggestion70 ADMINIgTHATlON EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GtrLP POLITICAL that tlio Sultan's prisoners should be released on payment of $2,COO by them. Hostilities then commenced, and two indecisive actions were fought between Sulaiman supported by the Ban Buwahah and the Riyamis in which eighteen rebels were killed and two of Sulaiman's force. The position at the time of writin? is a deadlock, the fort of Ziki has been relieved and the garrison strengthened, but no further fighting has taken place and His Highness is trying to raise a larger force in order to recover possession of Birkat-al-Mauz, a place which has always had considerable attractions for the Sultans of Oman. II. Oman was visited by no epidemic disease during the past year, and Epidemics and Calamities. the health of Maskat and Mattrah was normal throughout. No fires of im- portance have occurred and the only calamity worthy of mention was that which overtook a large Houri conveying passengers who had arrived from India by the mail of the 15th January to the quarantine station. This boat contrived to upset en route in a rough sea, and of the occupants 8 were drowned. It appeared that they had little chance of escape as they were carrying their money, which amounted to several hundred rupees per man in belts round their waists. The victims of this disaster were all Biluchis. ' Quarantine arrangements have been carried out during the year as usual and no complaints have been made against the administration which has been as before in the hands of the Agency Surgeon. III. The condition of the Customs department in Oman still gives cause for n . concern and needs considerable imnrove- ustom '* men t* In August last His Highness the Sultan being convinced of fraud on the part of his Superintendent, Mr Mahomed Ibrahim, who had served him continously in this capacity for Wee years, suddenly suspended him, and placed the routine arrangements in charge of the second official, Abd-ul-Karim, who has since carried on in the same manner as his predecessor. His Highness has the accounts supervised how ever by one of the principal Banyas of Maskat, Mr. Hamodar Dharamsi who receives $100 per mensem for his trouble. ' The unsatisfactory method of raising money to meet sudden calls upon the Imperial Exchequer to which a brief allusion was made in the report of last year has still been maintained, and it is apparent that the consequence has been that the debts of His Highness to merchants generally have still further increased. It is hoped that before the end of the present official year arrangements may have been made to place the Oman finances on a satisfac tory basis. IV. During the past 12 months there has been a perceptible decrease in Arms Traffic. va ^ ue 0: ^ arms and ammunition imported, such value bem 0, ffiven sq $1,074380 against 1,664,900 in 1904-1905. This decrease however does not signify any reduction m the number of articles imported, but merely a reduc- tion in the current proes, and there has not in fact been any diminution of the annual supply or demand. The export to Koweit and the Arab coast has been maintained; but fewer arms have been imported into the Mekran and Persian ^ Coasts than m 1904-1905, owing to the presence of one of His Majesty s Ships of war upon those coasts during a large portion of the season employed by Afghans and others for their smuggling operations.

Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, selected by His Majesty the King of Italy as Chief Arbitrator ; and the result was announced on the 8th August. The judgment of the Court of Arbitration was in two parts of three clauses each. Part I. 1. Before the 2nd of January 1892 Prance was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskatto fly the Prench flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules, 2. Owners of dhows who before 1893 have been authorized by Prance to fly the Prench flag retain this authorization as long as Prance renews it to the grantee. 3. After 2nd January 1892, Prance was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat to fly the Prench flag except on condition that their owners or fitters out had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by Prance as her &lt;{ protegesbefore the year 1863. Part 11. 1. Dhows of Maskat authorised as aforesaid to fly the Prench flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Maskat to the inviolability provided by the Prench-Maskat treaty of 1844. 2. The authorization to fly the Prench flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. 3. Subjects of the Sultan of Maskat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the Prench flag or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. Shortly after the issue of the above judgment it was agreed upon be tween the Governments of England and Prance that clause 3 of the 2nd part of the judgment should come into force without delay but that the question of investigation of the rights of persons and dhows to fly Prench flags and all other matters connected with a settlement according to the arbitration award should stand over until the return to Maskat of Monsieur Laronce, the perma nent incumbent of the French Consulate. Monsieur Laronce arrived in October, and shortly afterwards he and the Political Agent were instructed to confer together with a view :— (1) to decide as to the best method of making known to the sub jects of the Sultan of Oman the result of the arbitration, (2) to draw up a list of such subjects henceforth to be allowed to fly French flags. The officers concerned agreed at once that the result of the arbitration should be announced by His Highness the Sultan in the form of a proclama tion, and on March dth M. Laronce handed to Major Grey a list of persons and dhows which in his opinion might continue to fly the French flag according to the terms of the award, This list is still (April 1st) under examination and discussion. VI. His Majesty's ships havinsr been engaged on other duties no cap- siave trade tures of slave dhows have been made during the past year. There seems no doubt not only that few if any slaves have been brought over from Persia or Mekran since the last report was written but also that the importation72 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL of Africans is still on tlie decrease. It is highly probable that the represen tations so frequently made by His Majesty's Government to that of the French are at last bearing fruit, and that the latter are now investigating with ^ care than formerly the circumstances in which the tricolour is flown by Arabg 6 During 1905-1906, 93 slaves applied at this Agency for freedom.

VII. Referring to the massacre of part of the crew of the S.S. Baron Inner. Marine. dale, some account of which was given in , T1 , , last year's report, the chief inhahilants of Masirah Island who had been imprisoned by His Highness the Sultan of having assisted in hushing up the matter at first, were finally released with the concurrence of the Government of India in January. Of the ten ormnaliv imprisoned three had died and four had previouslv been released owin^ to their having become reduced in health. It is found that Bedouin Arabs speedily become unfit for further imprisonment from the mere fact of bein? in Confinement alone. The capture of the remaining actual culprits in &amp; this matter has not been found possible, owing to their having escaped into a part of the interior of Oman in which the Sultan's rule is practically unrecognised. VIII. The rainfall in Oman during the year under review has been uormal and calls for no comment. There heen no serious storms in Maskat or its neighbourhood. IX.

Maskat ; The 28th May 1906.74 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL C hapteb VIII.—ADMIKISTEATION REPORT, TRUCIAL CO A ST OP OMAN, 1905-1906. The remark made in last year's report, that the new Sheikh of Umm-al- , _ . Kawain was a person of some force of Umm-al-Kawain. , , u i*i i ' ut character, who was likely to acquire influence on the Coast, has proved well-founded. During the past year he has come considerably to the front; and though inclined to be headstrong appears to be a satisfactory man to deal with. It is a matter for much regret that Maktoom-bin-Hashar, Sheikh of Deba the most enlightened and reasonable of the Trucial Chiefs, died suddenly on 16th February 1906 at Debai apparently from heart disease. There was a quiet succession, his cousin Butti-bin-Soheil assuming the Chieftainship unopposed, the deceased Sheikh having left no adult sons. The new Sheikh is a middle-aged man and seems to be somewhat uncouth and less enlightened than his predecessor, but will do doubt improve. The Sheikh of Shargah has as usual been very unsatisfactory. He is ghar ab always friendly and pleasant to meet, but is said to be chiefly interested in his zenana, and in regard to his business and administrative duties suffers hope lessly from inertia. It is only by constant pressure that he can be got to effect the settlement of any claims at all. Simply owing to this failing he has gradually lost all his adherents, the Bedouin finding that they can get more easily elsewhere the small measure of support, justice and protection which he has always failed to give them. His apathetic character is notorious all over northern Oman. His son Rashid, at present Sheikh of Bas-al-Khaima, unfortu nately seems to take after his father in character. Sheikh Suggar seems practically to have given up all intention of coerc- Fu . ira ing Sheikh Hamad-bin-Abdulla, Headman of Pujaira, and as regards this individual and his affairs matters have been quiescent during the year and he shows signs of attaching himself to other Sheikhs of Umm-al-Kawain or Abu Thabi for practical protection. So weak is Sheikh Suggar's rule and so callous is he that there seems every reason to believe that in the course of time the whole Shimailiya tract between Mureir and Dibba will make itself independent of him. The two most important matters which have exercised the Residency in regard to the Trucial Coast during the year have been the reported intention of Bin Saood, the Wahabi leader, to endeavour to re-establish himself in those centres of Oman which were under Wahabi influence in the days of his forefathers, and secondly a troublesome quarrel between the Beni Kattab Bedouins and the Sheikh of Abu Tbabi. The latter tribe had formerly been in treaty relations with the Chiefs of Beni Kattab quarrel. Shargah and Ras-al-Kliaima, but finding that they got no assistance or presents from them, transferred their allegiance to Sheikh Rashid of Umm-al-Kawain, who since his accession has succeeded in gaining some reputation in northern Oman as a strong character and liberal patron among the Bedouin element. The first question which brought the Beni Kattab into issue with Sheikh Zaeed was a somewhat curious one. In the northern part of the Sultan of Maskat s territory, inland of the port of Shinas lies the Wadi Hatta in Western Hajar, at the head of which, on the Baraimi side, lie two villages, one on either side of the Wadi, named respectively Hijarain and Misfut, and inhabited by two sections of a small tribe called the Biduwat, who are always on bad terms. Those at Misfut not having been able to get relief when in difficulty from distant Maskat, attached themselves to the Nairn of Baraimi and received protection from the Sheikh of that tribe. Those at Hijarain were transferredRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 75 some years ago by the Sultan of Maskat to his friend Sheikh Maktoom of Debai, the understanding being tbat tbe latter should receive the revenue due from the village and in return should give the Biduwat what support and protection they needed at sbort notice. The Beni Kattab, it appears, in order to keep the road or the neighbouring hills open for themselves attempted to build a tower at a spot called Jebail commanding the caravan road, and to this both the JNaim Sheikh at Baraimi and the Sheikh of Debai took exception, and endeavoured to put pressure on the Heni Kattab to relinquish it. The people of Misfut however sided with the Beni Kattab and the latter also gained the support of their new friend the Sheikh of Umm-al-Kawain, while the Sheikh of Abu Thabi supported the attitude of his fellow tribesman, the Sheikh of Debai. None of the Trucial Sheikhs however seriously wanted to come to issue with their fellows over this matter, and in September the Chiefs cf Shargah, Umm -al-Kawain and Ajman rendezvoused with Sheikh Zaeed and Sheikh Maktoom at Debai and discussed their differences. Sheikh Zaeed who owing to his venerable age and reputation is the doyen of the Trucial Chiefs and likes to play that role, endeavoured to persuade the Sheikh of Umm-al-Kawain to refrain from allying himself with the Bedouins and thereby making them inconveniently powerful, and Sheikh Rashid made vague promises to respect his advice ; but nevertheless a few weeks later took the two Chief Bedouin Sheikhs of the Beni Kattab with him to Ajman and Shargah, and effected a mutual reconciliation doubtlessly, though not osten sibly, with the idea of opposing Sheikh Zaeed's policy. ' If the latter had left matters alone for a few months all would probably have gone well but his dignity was hurt at his failure to manage the Sheikh of Umm-al-Kawain and the Beni Kattab, and he accordingly proceeded to pick a quarrel with the latter in connection with a tribal dispute which they had recently had with the inhabitants of the 'Ealuch ,, villages of Mazum and Subeyki, who, though living among and subject to the settled Beni Kattab villages at Aflaj Beni Kattab in the Dhahireh, had rebelled against them on account of oppression experienced and had obtained the support of Sheikh Zaeed to their cause. The latter ultimately threatened to take the field against the Beni Kattab tribe if they did not send their elders to Abu Thabi with a view to a settlement of their quarrel by himself. It is necessary to explain that these so-called 'Baluchis' have been where they are for many generations and have entirely lost touch with their country of origin and the Baluch language, and at this time cannot be regarded in any other light than as a specialised section of an Arab tribe. This quarrel was at its height when the Resident travelled from Ras-al- Khaima to Baraimi in December; in fact he met a deputation of the Baluchis, with whom he had previously stayed at Mazum in 1902, on their way to see Sheikh Zaeed, and took the opportunity to send a letter to the latter warning him of the folly of taking action which would rouse all the bhann Sheikhs against himself, just at the time when it was most important that they should be united in order to show a common front to Bin Saood, should he appear in Oman, as he threat ened to do This homily had a good effect and Sheikh Zaeed eventually sought a peaceful solution of his differences with the Beni Kattab and the Sheikh of Umm -al-Kawain which was in a fair way of conclusion when the year closed. The chief point worthy of notice was that Sheikh Rashid made it clear that he did not intend to be dictated to by his venerable compeer and indeed maintained such an independent attitude that the Sheikh of Adu Thabi was ultimately obliged to make a compromise with him. The second disturbing factor lay in the fear lest the Wahabi Chief Bin Saood should make good his intention ot Expected visit from Bin Saood. regaining the centres of influence which his forbears had established on the Trucial Coast and in Oman in the and seventies. In September 1905 the 'Wahabi addressed letters to all the Trucial Chiefs informing them of his arrival in Katr and of his successful efforts in bringing about the reconciliation of the Al Morrah, Beni Hajir and76 ADMINISTRATION RE POET ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Ajman tribes, and saying that he hoped to visit the Chiefs' territories in th coming spring. e These missives were received with very different feelings by the Hina * Sheikhs of^ Debai and Abu Thabi on the one hand and the Ghafiri Chiefs Shargah, Ajman, Umm-al-Kawain and Ras-al-Khaima on the other • bv th former with extreme apprehension and by the latter with pleasuraW expectation born of the knowledge that their own importance would be much enhanced and that of Sheikh Zaeed diminished by the revival of Wahabeeism On receiving the intimation Sheikh Zaeed had at once communicated the purport to his fellow Hinawi and ally, the Sultan of Maskat, who was himself no less apprehensive, from the knowledge that any revival of Waha bee propaganda in Oman would probably mean that all the Ghafiri element among his subjects would rise against him. A personal and verbal warnim? against intriguing with Bin Saood was given to the Sheikhs by the Besident on hearing the news from them on his way to Baraimi and this was repeated officially on his return on behalf of the Government of India, who held that although the report might not take shape the matter was sufficiently serious to justify immediate action. In the absence of any established relations with Bin Saood and pending reference to His Majesty's Government it was considered simplest to sound Sheikh Mubarek on the subject informally. This the Political Agent, Captain Knox, was instructed to do, mentioning at the same time that he did not suppose that Government would view with approval any interference on the part of Bin Saood with the affairs of Sheikhs in treaty relation with us. Sheikh Mubarek was responsive and replied that he too had heard the report, and though he attributed it to a mere attempt to extort blackmail, he had already written to Bin Saood pointing out the folly of such a course. He however appears to have written again spontane ously, and according to the reply which he told the Political Agent that he had received and which there is no reason to doubt. Bin Saood replied to him in a very friendly tone saying that he had no sinister or unfriendly intentions and regretting if any careless observations he may have made should have been found harmful. Since then he has been fully occupied with events in Nejd and nothing more has been heard of his project. It is worthy of record with reference to the Zora tract mentioned in Zora. last y ear,s report, that one of Sheikh c ^ . xr • o . Zaeed's wives is a daughter of Sheikh Sultan bm Nasir Suweidi, whom Sheikh Zaeed wanted to install with his tribe, the Soudan, at Zora. Sheikh Zaeed's mother too was a relative of Sheikh Nasir. Monsieur Goguyer followed on the heels of the Eesident to Baraimi in M. Goguyer. December. H e first landed from the mail at Debai and endeavoured to proceed inland from there, but was not permitted by Sheikh Maktoom. He there fore proceeded by native boat to TJmm-al-Kawain and persuaded Sheikh Eashid to let him start from there. As the latter had just assisted the Resident m his arrangements, he presumably found it difficult to dispose of Goguyer s glib arguments. ^ does not appear that this venerable intriguer had any special object other than seizing the opening to see the interior and ascertain what Maior Cox had been doing. In May 1905 the Hesident drew attention to the inconvenience which Trucial Flag. might arise from the fact that the Trucial fl -u j t, * j.* i p Chiefs do not fly the orthodox Trucial flag prescribed by Article 3 of the General Treaty of 1820; and recommended that several pattern flags should be given gratis to each Chief and that they should be called upon to fly the correct Treaty Flag. Owing to the absence of Foreign Powers and Ships in the Gulf in th e past, not much stress was laid upon strict adherence to Treaty in this respect 5 but the advent of ^ the Belgian Customs Administration and Ships of Foreign rowers has made it very necessary that vessels claiming our protection should be indentifiable as such. ° r . . ,RESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. 77 The Sheikhs were inclined to be shy of the correct treaty fiag, on the in timation first made to them by the Native Agent, but had nothing to say when shown the original treaty signed by their ancestors. The matter was still under correspondence however when the year ended. The traffic in negro-slaves has not come into evidence at all on the Coast during the 12 months under report. Slave Trade. On the other hand the ports are full of indigent Mekranis, many of whom are practically in a state of slavery. This Mekran slavery question is an increasingly difficult problem. Apart from those who are actually sold by their own Mirs and headmen in the maritime districts of Mekran, many more come over voluntarily to escape from famine or oppression at home. Well knowing what to expect, they regard the Drospect as preferable to the harder struggle for life which has driven them awav Once arrived in Oman some make their livelihood and become free communities; others lapse into slavery and their free relatives are afraid to assist them. Specific cases when reported are treated on the same lines as in the case of neero-slaves. P. Z. COX, Major, Folitical Resident in the Persian Qulf, B ritish R esidency, B tjshire ; The 23rd September 1906.78 ADMINISTRATION RETORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL C hapter IX.—ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BAHBAIN POLITICAL AGEJSCY POR THE YEAR 1905-06. The purview of this Agency includes {a) the Protected St;ite of Bahrain (&amp;) the independent Peninsula of Katar, {c) the Turkish ' Sanjak of Najd,'' which comprises ihe Oases of Hasa and Katif, the outpost of Ojair and a few islands, and (d) the tribal territories adjoining the Sanjak, the status of which has not yet clearly been determined. These diflerent districts will be treated under three headings, the Sanjak and the tribal territories being coupled together for the sake of convenience. Speaking generally, the year under review has been a most prosperous one for the whole Agency. The pearl-fisheries have proved more profitable than for three years past, while the date-crop in Hasa and Katif has been a bumper one permitting of an unprecedently large export to India and the Red Sea Ports. The trade of JBahrain for the year 1905, which includes loth the pearling and date seasons alluded to, and which is intimately connected with the trade of both Katar and the Turkish Sanjak, shows the astonishing increase of 57i per cent, in volume over the previous best year on record. It seems certain that the commercial prosperity of Bahrain will advance steadily. In view of this fact, it is to be hoped that the British India Steam Navigation Company will improve their present arrangements for dealing with the local tiade, as at present much discontent with their methods exists amongst all commercial classes in the Agency. It is also probable that the question of the extension of the telegraph cable to Bahrain will call for con sideration in the near future. Above all, the reformation of the Bahrain Customs administration is a measure which shows itself constantly to be more pressing, not only in the interests of the Chief of Bahrain but of all people residing within the Agency. 'Rainfall and Harvest. —The rainy season in this Agency is considered to commence immediately after the close of the main pearling season about the middle of October, and to end at the commencement of the corresponding following pearling season, about the 15th May. The rainy days in Bahrain are generally only three or four in number, but on the adjacent mainland the fall is greater, permitting of the raising of food-grains in the vicinity of Hasa and affording fine crops of hay in Katar and the other parts. In Bahrain it is only the Sheikhs who w elcome a plentiful fall of rain, as no one else keeps herds or flocks, and the poorer classes suffer considerably in their frailly- constructed huts of date-fronds. If rain falls late, it is also liable to do injury to the date-palms. In the year under report, the rain commenced early on the mainland, and a satisfactory supply has been received throughout the winter. In Bahrain the fall has probably been rather less than the average. As mentioned elsewhere, the date-harvest in Hasa and Katif was a magnificent one ; that in Bahrain was rather deficient. A record of the rainfall in Bahrain has been kept during the last four years at the American Mission Hospital. The figures are as follows:— 1902-03 , , 5 67 inches. 1903-0 4 1-77 „ 1904-05 3-12 „ 1905-06 2-46 „ JPuhlic Health. —The health of all parts of the Agency, except Bahrain, has been good throughout the year. An epidemic of plague—the second in three years—unfortunately manifest ed itself in these islands early in May and lasted till about the end of June. It confined itself however to the two towns of Manama and Muharrag, in each ofRESIDENCY FOK THE YEAR 1905-1906. 79 which about 400 eases are believed to have occurred, with fatal results to fifty per cent. The victim of greatest importance was Sharida-bia-Ali, the Chiefs Confidential Clerk. Other persons who lost relatives were Haji MuqMl-al-Dhakhair, the richest Arab merchant, Yusuf Kanow, honorary munshi and assistant to the Agency, and Abdul Aziz Ewazi, a rich Persian merchant. A few cases also occurred at sea amongst the pearling fleet. The epide mic subsided without the adoption of any remedial measures at the commence ment of the hot weather. Two European ladies, both wives of Doctors of the American Mission Hgspital, died of typhoid fever in Manama—Mrs. Thoms on the 25th April 1905, and Mrs. Bennett on the 20th January 1906. About a dozen sepoys of the 125ih (Napier's) Rifles belonging to the Agency Guard at Manama have also shown signs at the commencement of 1906 of having contracted Beri-beri, though the cause is absolutely unknown. Three sepoys unfortunately succumbed to the disease, but the others, with the exception of two in Hospital at the close of the year, who it is hoped are recovering, have returned to duty. The Victoria Memorial Hospital, attached to the Asrency, was opened to the public, though the buildings were not quite completed, on the arrival from India of Assistant Surgeon Ghulam Ali Khan on the 13th July 1905. The Hospital was again closed on the Assistant Surgeon's resigning his appoint ment on the 21st December 1905 The appointment of another Medical Officer has not yet been made. The health of the Chief of Bahrain was good except for about two months at the commencement of 1906, when he found considerable difficulty in shak ing off the bad effects of a chill, Folitical. —The political event of most importance in these islands was the Bahrain, surrender of Sheikh Ali-bin-Ahmad to his uncle, the Chief, on the 18th July 1905 with 4 absconded followers. The five prisoners were transferred to His Majesty's Ship Sphinx on the 31st July 1905, and in due course were sent dowa to India via Bushire in the Royal Indian Marine Ship Lawrence. Sheikh Ali was sentenced to five years' exile in Bombay under the supervision of the Government of that Presidency, and the four negroes were confined in the Central Jail, Hyderabad, Sind, for six months. They returned safely to Bahrain on the 6th April 1906. The relations between Sheikh Esa and the Political Agent have been steadily though slowly improving throughout the year; the general situation however is still somewhat unsatisfactory as the Chief is inclined to regard all advice tendered to him as attempting to undermine his internal absolute sovereignty. Movements of the Chief and his family. —Sheikh Esa came over from Muharrag to his summer quarters near Manama on the 2nd July and returned to Muharrag on the 22nd Noveutber. Be spent about 30 days in camp^ at various times in the centre and southern parts of the island, and resided during the rest of the year at Muharrag. Sheikhs Hamad and Muhammad bin Esa paid a lO-days* visit to Katar (Lusail and Doha) in October 1905. The former with his other brother Abdallah spent four days on the Dthaharan mainland in December, and about three weeks in December and January in the vicinity of Linga. The Chief's Wazir and relative Abdul Rahman bin Abdul Wahab made his fifth pilgrimage to the Haj in the spring of 1906. A good deal of light has been thrown during the year upon the political Katar. status ol this Peninsula, in the course of enquiries made in connection with the Per4an Gulf Gazetteer. It will suffice, however, here to state that the resignation by Sheikh Jasim bin Thani of the Kaim-makam-ship of Doha has never ar parently been officially accepted by the Turkish Government, nor has his abdication of the Chiefshipof the Bin Thani Principality been fully given effect to, even if in times of sickness it has been seriously contemplated.so ADMINISTRATION' REPORT ON THE PERSIAN' GULP POLITICAL The Sheikhs of Doha and Wakra are theoretically the local Agents of their relative and Chief, Jasim, though they possess a. large measure of uncontrolled authority, and the first-named of these two Sheikhs, to whom the Kaim-makam- ship with its irksome duties of conciliating the Turkas has been delegated is, if a strong man, in virtue of his position as probably successor to the Chief ship, most naturally able to acquire a position of almost equal influence with that of his aged tribal Chief. The result has been that during the past few years a certain amount of jealousy has sprung up between the two sons of Muhammad bin Thani, and that Sheikh Ahmad has not always found it convenient to see eye to eye with his brother Jasim. The most apparent instance of this fact is found in the relations of the two brothers with the Wahhabi Chief of Riadh. Sheikh Jasim has always been the bitter enemy of Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa of Abu Dthabi. He is also a sincere 'Wahhabi, and a well-wisher therefore of the Amir of Riadh, to whom each year he has been in the habit of sending pecuniary and other gifts. Sheikh Ahmad, however apparently distrusted the Amir, and he, therefore, of late years cultivated friendly relations with Sheikh Zaid and formed an alliance with the A1 Morra and Beni Hajir tribes to resist the advances of the Wahhabi who has powerful adherents east of Hasa in the Ajman tribe. To such a degree of difference had the policies of the two brothers arrived in 1905, that when Sheikh Jasim sent a letter of welcome with 338,000 in cash and a present of rifles and rice to Bin Saud on his arrival in Hasa in July, Sheikh Ahmad sent the Amir word that if he continued his advance across the border of Katar he and Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa were prepared to meet him with an army of 25 000 men to turn him back. During the earlier months of the year under review the internal condition of Katar was generally tranquil though rumours were sometimes heard that Sheikh Ali-bin-Ahmed, the absconder from Bahrain, who had taken refuge amongst the Nairn tribe, was contemplating mischief. These rumours were fortunately falsified by the surrender of Sheikh Ali in July. In April 1905, Sheikh Ahmad-bin-Thani led a raid of A1 Morra and Ben Hajir (Makhadhdhaba) tribesmen against the 'Ajman, Beni Khalid (Amayirs) and Beni Hajir (A1 Muhammad) tribes in the districts of Jafura, which divided Hasa from Katar and Biyadh between Hasa and Katif. After a small success and the acquisition of some looted flocks the raiders returned to Katar with a loss of five lives. In September 1905, Sheikh Ahmad-bin-Thani unwittingly murdered a Muhammadan Turkish subject, who had visited Doha for trading purpose, and it was anticipated that this accident would seriously embroil the Sheikh with the Basra authorities. Sheikh Ahmad had mistaken the murdered man for a Jew, who was bis partner, and on learning his mistake he expressed his regret to the Turkish authorities and tendered the usual blood^money of 51800, which, however, was refused by the murdered man's relatives. In November, the Political Agent paid a short visit to Katar by native boat. He stayed three days in the Camp of Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani at Bu-Hasa, about 10 miles west of Lusail, and 24 hours with Sheikh Ahmad-bin- Thani at Doha. Sheikh Jasim was found in remarkably good health consider ing his great age. He was however temporarily suffering from sore eyes, from which complaint it is satisfactory to know that he soon afterwards recovered. His conversation indicated that his mental qualities were still unimpaired. Sheikh Ahmad-bin-Thani gave the impression of possessing much discretion and mtelligence. He was evidently seriously exercised at the heaviness of the lurkish incubus at Doha, but as a patriotic Arab he did not seem much to favour the alternative of intimate relations with the British. In the course of this visit the evidence of Sheikh Jasim was recorded under a Commission received from the High Court of Bombay, and subsequent events have shown that the settlement of several commercial claims of British subjects and proteges against residents of Katar was also materially advanced. I 11 Sheikh Jasim's Camp an interview was also accorded to Nasir-bin- Mubarak A1 Abdallah, the Bahrain Pretender and son-in-law of Sheikh Jasim, with the result that the futility of his claims was at last recognized and admitted.Q-j EESIDEKCY FOE THE YEAK 1905-1906.

The result was that on the 3rd March, a large caravan was ambuscaded at Baraiman on the Ojair-Hasa road by the Al Morra, Beni Haiir and Manasir tribes, when 45 armed Turks of the escort and a number of camelmen and travellers were killed and property to the value of 3 lakhs of rupees was carried olf. The Bedouin have so far suffered no punishment for this outrage The customs of the Sanjak (tlofuf, Ojair and Eat if) were again leased out to the Bin Faris-Bin Akhwan syndicate in April 14305. The price mid for the year was 13,937^ Liras, giving an increase of 33 7 per cent, on the previous year's lease. In October the Turks attempted to introduce a poll-tax into Eatif but were unable to enforce it. 5 In March 1906, a good deal of rioting took place in Hofuf and Mubamz m consequence of the Mutesarrif's endeavour to carry out a census of the peonle The attempt was eventually abandoned. One hundred and thirty-four civil and 55 criminal complaints have been presented and admitted at the Political Agency during the year, some by British subjects, others by foreigners and the remainder by Bahrain subjects.

In September, some 8 Beni Hajir Bedouin who had been visiting the Chief of Bahrain for their customary presents, made free with a boat which they found at Hamala on the west coast of Bahrain, and went off in her to the mainland, without taking any steps to ensure the return of the vessel. In October, three Bedouin who were proceeding as passengers in a boat from Doha (Katar) to Bahrain, suddenly fell upon and murdered — / — jt — another passenger, robbed all the remaining persons on board and compelled the boat men to divert their course direct to the Dthaharan mainland. In December 1905, there is grave reason to suspect that a technical piracy was committed on a Persian cargo-boat laden with wheat which had been driven by bad weather aground on the north-west coast of Katar near Abu Dhaluf. The villagers of this place are accused of having appropriated the greater part of the cargo in the name of salvage money though they allowed the boat to leave after a detention of about 15 days. The consider ation of the case by Government has not yet been completed, but it is si^ni. ficant that the incident seems absolutely parallel to one which occurred in this village in February 1899, when no punishment was inflicted upon the culprits. The Political Agent made two short sailing trips of about 4 days' dura tion each, in June and July, in search of the pirate, Ahmad bin Salman. He was accompanied by about 50 armed retainers of the Chief of Bahrain, and, though he failed to fall in with the pirates, his party was seen by them' and his action is believed to have curbed to some extent the enterprise of the outlaws. In November, he paid a short visit, again in a sailing boat, to Katar, a more detailed reference to which has been made ante. In September, he paid a brief visit to Katif in His Majesty's Ship Sphinx and interviewed the Kaimmakam, Nejib Bey, in company with Commander Bowman, E..N. At the end of January 1906 he proceeded, again in His Majesty's Ship Sphinxt to Abu Dhaluf, near the north-west corner of Katar, to enquire into a charge of g'w^-piracy preferred against the villagers by the crew of a Persian cargo-boat. In February he made a short trip of inspection amongst the Phoonician tumuli in Bahrain, for the purpose of selecting those to be opened on behalf of the Indian ArchsQological Department. In March, he went into camp for 9 days with the majority of his Infantry Detachment at Sakhir, in the centre of Bahrain, for change of air and to be near two of the sons of Sheikh Esa-bin-Ali, who invariably spent most of the spring season at that place. Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., paid one visit to Bahrain during the year under review, in February 1906. He had twice come to the Islands in the cold wea ther preceding the commencement of the year, and has again visited Bahrain twice immediately after the close of the year. Bahrain has received six visits from British men-of-war during the year. His Majesty's Ship Sphinx spent some time here in July, September, October and January, and His Majesty's Ship Lapwing a few days in April and October. In April 1905 Mr. G. Pilgrim, Deputy Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India, revisited Bahrain to complete the inspection be had been making of the Island in 1904. On the 6th April 1905 a young Frenchman, named Gaston Perronne arrived in Bahrain for the ostensible purpose of purchasing pearls. He did not seem to be well provided with funds nor to have much expert knowledge of the subject. It is believed that he combined this business with the work of newspaper correspondent. He left Bahrain on the 30th July, having in the interim spent one week at Linga. Movements of the Political Agent. Political Besident's Visits. Navy.

Koweit Currency. —At times the value of the Maria Theresa dollar has fluctuated considerably during the past year. 3 3. Fearl Fisheries. —The pearling season commenced in May and closed in September. Almost half of the population of Koweit went to the fisheries. It is interesting to note that in the early days of September some of the pearl boats, which returned to Koweit without the permission of their Chief Nakhoda, who alone has the power to declare the season closed, were sent baok by the Sheikh to continue fishing pearls until their Chief had announced by gun-fire that the season was closed. They went back and returned with the rest of the fleet on the 15th of September, the larger boats firing guns as they approached the town. The season was a very successful one and the pearls found were of superior quality and commanded favourable prices. 14 Ceylon pearl fisheries.— Koweit pearl divers proceeded to the Ceylon pearl fisheries during the year. 15. Boat huilding. —A large number of new pearling boats were built during the year. The building industry provides employment for about 300 native carpenters whose wages are from J a real to 4 reals per day exclusive of food. The wood and nails employed in the construction are imported from India. 16. Sheikh Moharatis relations with Turkish Sheikh Mobarak's relations with Turkish officials have been friendly and satisfactory. He has subscribed a sum of T. £450 for the construction of new barracks at Bussorah and received a letter of thanks with a photograph of the completed portion of the barracks. It was said iu the letter that no one in Iraq had contributed as handsomely. Sheikh Mobarak then contributed a further sum of T. £200. The Sheikh has always received Turkish officials well and treated them with kindness and generosity. 17. Turkish Troops. —As many as 500 Turkish soldiers and officials of rank, mostly deserters, took shelter in Koweit and were invariably fed and passed on to Bussorah by Sheikh Mobarak. The soldiers always complained that in Nejdthey were kept on half rations and badly clothed and were, there fore, compelled to run away to save their lives. Their condition, as seen while in Koweit, was miserable. 18. Foreigners. —A Turkish subject named Hatinaglou, with a com panion, arrived early in June. They were in Koweit for a week and requested the Sheikh to allow them to open a trading house in Koweit. This was refused and they were told to quit Koweit. They, however, paid a visit to Kathama. 19.

D.' »REVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP, The past year, from an administrative point of view, may perhaps be best de scribed as one of expectant inactivity. There has been no scope for energy or enterprise in new directions and in regard to one and all of the posts whose passing history is now dealt with, it may, I think, truly be said, in each case, that one-half the energies of the representative of British interests have been devoted, no doubt with good reason, to keeping the other within check, often under suffi. ciently trying conditions. Two epoch-making developments have contributed to induce this necessity. Firstly the determination of His Majesty's Government to come to an amicable settlement w^th Eussia in regard to our respective and often conflicting interests in the Middle East and the progress of negociations in furtherance of this settle ment. Secondly the spread of the nationalist movement in Persia resulting in the grant of a constitution by Mozaffer-ud-din Shah by Firman of 1st January 1907, while actually on his death-bed. I may mention here that contrary to precedent the actual demise of His Majesty after a lingering illness on the 5th January was received with almost complete indifference throughout the country ; but his long illness and the conse quent unsettled condition of affairs in Tehran resulted in the prevalence of much disorder in the distant provinces and Fars especially was a prey to it. Mozaffer- ud-din Shah was succeeded on 9th January by Prince Mahommed Ali Mirza, Gover- nor-Generalof Azerbaijan, his eldest son by a non-Kajar wife, to whom he be queathed a most difficult inheritance which makes the future both of tlie sovereign and of the country a matter for much speculation and grave concern. With extremely delicate negociations in progress between the Eussian Gov- ernment and ourselves in regard to our spheres of interest or disinterest in Persia, and with the existence within the country itself of a strong wave of national feeling, easily convertible in its early stages into an anti-foreign movement, it is not difficult to realise the necessity which has existed for extreme caution on the part of the representatives of Government in the conduct of their duties within the sphere in question, having for its object the avoidance of any action or measure calculated, either to embarrass the negociations above mentioned, or to excite the suspicions of the Persian public and Press, already considerably aroused, by rumours of the contemplated entente, and convinced, according to their lights, that any such un natural fraternization between the Lion and the Bear can but presage ill for the future of Iran. Under such conditions all local considerations have had to give way to weightier interests, and thus it is that the history of the several outposts of the Bushire Eesidency for the past year furnishes few new themes of special interest or importance, and leaves the salient questions mentioned in last year's Report where we left them. With these prefatory remarks I may briefly discuss the several reports here embodied. I.—BUSHIRE AND FARS. The progress of German commercial competition, including the acquisition of mining rights on Abu Musa Island by Herr Wonckhaus ; the institution of an almost international campaign against the Persian Gulf Quarantine System as ad ministered by the Government of India for His Majesty the Shah, a campaign to which jealousy of the special position of Great Britain seems to have given no little zest; the travail of Bushire, in common with her sister townships, in the birth of constitutional ideas and the aftermath thereof,—these are the salient points of the last year's history of Bushire. Similarly, that of Shiraz is almost entirely concerned with the convulsions of the same infant prodigy, aggravated by the general chaos and anarchy existing throughout Fars, as the result of several years of gross misgovernment. It is difficult to conceive how by its own unaided efforts the Persian Gov ernment can ever hope to bring back these distant provinces to a state of order and prosperity. II.—ARABISTAN. The topic which so far as the record is concerned has been chiefly in evidence D'Arcy OU Conoassion. durin g th f ^ ^ ^ ^ ° f , gress and difficulties of the D^Arcy Oil Concession Syndicate the inception of whose operations was chronicled last year*REVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP. 3 The Concessionaires have continued their labours with the utmost perseverance in the face of innumerable difficulties, both petty and serious difficulties arising primarily from the unbusiness-like methods of the Khans and greatly aggravated by family dissensions among them culminating in a disingenuous attempt on their part, supported by the Persian Government, to upset the original agreement come to with the Concessionaires and to substitute another in terms dictated by the Central G-overnment, who profess not to recognise the existing document. This manoeuvre however has hitherto been successfully resisted. His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Ahwaz to whom, in the interests of the Syndicate the tedious negociations with the Khans, were entrusted by His Majesty's Legation has had a difficult task in this connection throughout the year, the closer acquain* tance with the Khans which the events of the last two years have given us, proving that the thin veneer of western civilisation which they affect supplies but a poor disguise to characters full of Oriental caprice and unreliability, which make it ex tremely difficult to conduct business with them on satisfactory lines or to keep them up to their admitted obligations. In spite of all obstacles, however, praiseworthy progress has been made ; communications have been provided, plant and workshops erected and borings commenced. It is therefore to be hoped that success in the tapping of productive springs of oil will ere long reward their hitherto uphill labours. The question of the upkeep of the Lynch Road from Ahwaz to Ispahan has also Communications; Alwaz-Ispahaa Road. b ' een a 8°.°^ in ?yidence. Arrange- ments which will provide for its systematic maintenance in good order have still to be devised and perfected, the chief impedi ment to their institution being the unsatisfactory relations which prevail between the Khans and Messrs. Lynch. But these are difficulties which will no doubt adjust themselves gradually, and meanwhile the pressure put upon the Khans has sufficed to keep the track in a sufficiently passable condition to ensure its remain* ing an assured artery of traffic. Owing to the political conditions referred to in the preface, no forward action Lnristan Roads. ^ been possible in connection with the improvement of communications in Luristan either in the direction of Khoremabad or through Pusht-i-Kuh. On the other hand Brevet Major A. W. Baird, Gordon Highlanders, who travelled from Ahwaz to Kermanshah by the latter route, reported favourably of the route and of the friendly attitude of the Wali. Furthermore, the Sardar Mukarram, at present Governor-General of Arabistan-cwm-Luristan. in a recent interview with the Besi- dent made it evident that he was both fully alive to the great advantages of opening up communications through this country, and bent upon doing his utmost in that direction if left undisturbed in his charge. Nephew, as he is, of the Nizam* es-Sultaneh, one of the most strenuous and enlightened men in Persia at the present time, whose influence and interests in Arabistan are well known, and com paratively successful administrator as he has so far proved in this important province, the Sardar seems to be a person whom it will be good policy on our part to support. But the degree to which we shall be able to maintain our present interests in Arabistan and Luristan in the future, doubtless depends a great deal on the nature of the Anglo-Russian settlement now under negociation and the extent to which its terms will or will not hamper our enterprise in that province. In this con nection it may be presumed from the appointment of a Russian Agent at Khorema bad and the visit of another to Burujird and the neighbourhood, that the region is one which does not lack interest for our neighbours. Rumours, usually followed by anxious inquiries from the Shaikh of Mahom- Karun Irrigation Scheme. merah, have been current from time to time during the year, alleging the imminent or actual grant of a concession, at one moment to the Dutch, at another to the German Government; at another to a Persian Syndicate; rumours which have never taken shape, but which have been so far well founded in that the subject in question has undoubtedly attracted a good deal of attention in diplomatic quarters. Owing to the incidence of our negociations with Russia any special activity on our own part has been considered inexpedient for the present; at the same time the overtures which have been made during the year to His Majesty's Government or4 HE VIEW BY THE POLITICAL KESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP. Legation by representatives of other powers, in recommendation of concerted international action, have been successfully parried for the time being, on the ostensible ground that the political juncture is inconvenient. The progress of this pregnant question however cannot be long delayed; meanwhile Major Morton K. E. has been continuing his exhaustive investigations throughout the year on both banks of the Karun and at the close was on the point of proceeding to India to draw up his report. His Majesty's Government have recognised the desirability of supporting the Shaikh of Mahommerah's position and of keeping him in confidence to a reasonable extent in regard to developments of the Irrigation Question; and he himself rightly or wrongly feels confident that his paramount influence with the peasant population of Southern Arabistan places him in a position to block any attempt to carry through a scheme in which his own position and interests are not in his opinion adequately represented. Mahommerah Aflata. . Turning to Mahommerah affairs, the chief events of note have been.— {a) The transfer of the government of Behbehan district from the hands of the Governor-General of Fars to the control of the Shaikh of Mahommerah and the Bakhtiari Khans in concert. (6) The marriage of Shaikh Chasib, son and heir of Shaikh Khazal, to the daughter of Haji Eais ut Tujar, his father's well-known adviser and factotum; an alliance eminently calculated to promote the material interest and influence of the Sardar's astute henchman. (c) The very close intimacy which has developed between Shaikh Khazal and Shaikh Mubarak of Koweit. Though the one is a Shia and the other a Sunni Mahommedan, apart from their persuasion, they obviously have much in common at the present time. Each has a portentous ' feringi ' scheme of great magnitude looming on his horizon and promising a revolution of local conditions to an extent of which neither Chief can form more than a very hazy conception; in one case it is the Karun Irrigation Scheme and in the other the Baghdad Eailway. The contemplation of these problems brings with it no doubt dreams of political absorp tion as well as of wealth, and the need and means of active self-preservation must surely be their main bond of sympathy and theme of discussion. Their ability to meet more frequently than heretofore is as a matter of fact primarily the direct result of the recent purchase by Shaikh Mubarak of a fine sea-going steam yacht in which it delights him to make frequent trips to the Shatt- el-Arab, but the intimacy has been sufficiently marked to excite comment, especially in Eussian quarters. The communings of the two Arab celebrities have been variously attributed {a) to the attractions of Pan-Islamism; (6) to dreams of the inception of an Arab commonwealth in Central Arabia ; (c) to an intention on their part (according to Eussian suspicions, actively instigated by the British) to assert their indepen dence of Persia and Turkey respectively; {d) to the fear of Shaikh Mubarak of absorption by his friends the English, alleged to be fast becoming inconvenient to him; and to a desire on his part to abdicate and retire to seclusion to some quiet spot in his neighbour's territory between the Tigris and the Karun. Locally no tangible foundation has ever been apparent for any one of these conjectures, and it will probably prove in the sequel that we need go no further to account for the close freindship of the two Shaikhs than the community of in terest and sentiment first indicated. The negociations for the acquisition from the Shaikh of Mahommerah of a Housing Of His Majesty's Vice-Cousul. site for a new Vice-Consulate, which have been protracted, seem to be approaching finality, and it is hoped that the coming year will see our representative more suit ably accommodated. III.—KERMANSHAH. There was a change of incumbents during the year, Captain Gough proceeding on leave to Europe in August and being succeeded by Captain Haworth, who after vacating Kennan in November 1905 had proceeded on furlough. During a short interregnum which intervened Captain Crossls, LM.S^ Consular Surgeon, was in charge of the Consulate.REVIEW BY THE POLITICAL EEStDENT IN THE ^Eft^IAN GtTL^. 5 The Government of India is interested in the commerce rather than the poli^ tics of Kermanshah. In the latter regard any events of the year worthy of record have been entirely concerned with the constant dissensions between factions in the town in connection with the institution of the local Majlis ; while the surrounding districts depending on Kermanshah were continually disturbed chiefly owing to ordinary conditions of local misgovernment and the confusion prevailing at the capital. Notwithstanding this it is satisfactory to find that there was a considerable increase in the volume of trade, especially in imports from the United Kingdom and India, and His Majesty's Consul considers that there is still a good deal to be done within his charge in the way of trade development. In the Customs, Monsieur Heynssens who after coming to an impasse with the Darya Begi at Bushire had replaced Monsieur Waffelsert at Kermanshah, appears to be proving as conciliatory there in his relations with the British representative, as he showed himself to be while at Bushire. IV.—KEEMAN. The affairs of Kerman call for no special comment. The annual border meeting for the investigation and disposal of claims between British subjects and the inhabi tants of Persian Baluchistan which had been contemplated for some date in January, had to be given up owing to the unsettled position in Tehran and the fear that the expected demise of His Majesty Mozaffer-ud-din Shah would excite the Baluch population to lawlessness and make the movement of small armed parties in the provinces too dangerous. The experimental measure referred to in last year's review connected with the appointment of a British officer as Vice-Consul at Bam, has hardly fulfilled ex pectations. Lieutenant Ogilvie's 12 months' experience, as dealt with in his re ports, seems to indicate that an officer located there is by no means favourably situated for watching the Arms Traffic, and as far as our commercial interests are concerned, it would appear that the trade of Bam is almost entirely with India and that there is at present no foreign competition. Lieutenant Ogilvie applied for furlough towards the end of the year and the c expediency of replacing him for the present is under the consideration of Govern ment. This is a question which will no doubt be affected by the nature of our pending settlement with Eussia. v.— BUNDER ABBAS. As in the case of Kermanshah a good deal of unrest prevailed in Bunder Abbas itself and continual lawlessness and insecurity inland and on the main trade Routes, a state of things primarily attributable to neglect and rapacity on the part of petty local officials, but no doubt referable ultimately, at any rate so far as the Fars jurisdiction is concerned, to the anarchy arising from constant changes in the personnel of the Governor-General of Ears and Staff and the resulting ad ministrative chaos treated of fully in Mr. Grahame's record of Shiraz history. The important inland township of Lar, under Ears, taking advantage of its own convenient isolation and the present impotency of the Shiraz Government, has rendered itself conspicuously troublesome by harbouring absconding debtors from Bunder Abbas and Lingah. It will be noted that the same immunity from administrative control has enabled the Deputy Governor to dabble freely in the Arms Traffic. Hitherto repeated representations to the Fars Government on the sub ject of the attitude of Lar have proved abortive, but it is possible that under His Excellency the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the new Govemor-General-elect, an improve ment in administrative conditions may ensue under which Lar will come in for closer attention. Meanwhile it is interesting to record that the Laris generally have displayed a friendly and well disposed spirit towards British travellers passing through their district. With reference to the question of the illegal imposts which have for so long * handicapped trade in the port of Bunder Abbas itself, it is satisfactory to note that after repeated representations from His Majesty's Legation at Tehran and the 3147 Jf. D.Ov, O / 6 REVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULJ'. Residency at Bushire, representations which have had the hearty co-operatioiT^f the local Customs authorities, the levies have one by one been removed 0 The great ' Rahdari ' grievance however still continues unremedied on the trade routes. The one or two political difficulties connected with the Henjam -Bunder Abbas Cable, which were mentioned last year as outstanding between ourselves and the Persian Government, remained much where we left them. It is true that in the matter of the location of the Cable-House local difficulties continued for some months owing to the aggressive tactics of Monsieur Stas Director of Customs, who appeared to have fallen completely under the influ' ence of the Russian Consul, but in December Monsieur Stas was transferred' and he having replaced by a more friendly official the matter has since rested in peace so far as the local officials are Concerned. Meanwhile the Tehran authorities have been so much engrossed with affairs nearer home, and His Majesty's Government with the Anglo-Russian negociations, that such inconvenient local problems as these connected with the Henjam Telegraph Station and the Bunder Abbas Cable-House have for the time been laid aside. No inconvenience accrues to British interests from this delay in settlement as in the meanwhile we have all the use from the Cable that we need for our own purposes, and the Henjam difficulties are for the present quiescent. The progress of the Anglo-Russian negotiations and the desire of both Grov- ernm'ents that they should not be made more difficult by the incidence of fric- tion between any of their local representatives in Persia has apparently had little influence on the attitude of the Russian representative at Bunder Abbas who seems unable to throw off the strong anti-English propensities which he displayed in former years at Bushire and in which he has indulged unceasingly since his return to the Persian Gulf. His unfriendly tactics have been specially manifested in connection with Quarantine, and with the Cable-House Question above mentioned, and also by the employment of several shady characters on errands of espionage, both upon his British Colleague personally and in other directions further afield. It is to be hoped however that the imminent conclusion of the agreement will have the effect of placing a check on Monsieur Owseenko's amenities or of bringing about hib transfer to some other sphere of usefulness. VI.—PERSIAN MEKRAN CO AST. ( - /j Owing to the difficulties under which the central and provincial Governments were labouring in connection with the Shah's.d-emise and the spread of the national movement, it was not possible to arrange this yearlor the usual Border meeting for the settlement of cases with Persian subjects arising in the jurisdiction of the Political Officer, Mekran Coast, and^ the report of this section for the year calls for little comment except as regards the Arms Traffic which unfortunately flour ished exceedingly, in spite of the efforts of His Majesty's ships in patrolling the Coast and in endeavouring to cut off consignments on their way from Maskat. THs-year-ugain they received the utmost co-operation from the Assis tant Superintendent of the Jask Division of the Telegraph Department, but it was found impossible to circulate news in time, and no luck attended their efforts; meanwhile the smugglers pursued their vocation with undaunted boldness. A clever capture of a large caravan by Baluchistan Levies near Robat just after the close ol the year was a very satisfactory piece of news)rbut beyond making the Afgans careful to avoid passing through an acre of British territory it is unlikely to have any permanent effect in discouraging- the trade. This ques tion is fast increasing in moment and urgency, but little improvement is appa- rently to be looked for pending the meeting of the contemplated International Conference during the coming year. VII.—MASKAT. TV treacherous murder of Shaikh Suleiman bin Suweilim, whose useful services were sympathetically referred to in last year's review, is a serious blow to the Sultan s interests. His assassinatecaused much perturbation at the time, and His Highness even appears to have contemplated for a while theREVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP. 7 possibility of another attack by tribesmen upon Maskat; but happily nothing of this sort occurred. In the matter of external politics there is little to record, as the slow pro gress of the final settlement in the French Flag case has still made it undesirable to pursue the several other important Maskat questions briefly mentioned last year. The said settlement will doubtless take shape in the near future, but it would hardly have been believed when it was decided in the spring of 1903 to submit the question forthwith to the arbitration of the Hague Tribunal, that four and possibly five years would elapse before the final solution was arrived at. The Arms Traffic continues year by year to flourish with increasing viru lence and defies all efforts to cope with it, on lines at present possible. The question has already been touched upon in connection with the Mekran Coast Eeport, and as soon as the conclusions of the Anglo-Eussian Agreement and the French Flag negociations are respectively assured it will no doubt be subjected to fresh examination by His Majesty's Government. * Meanwhile there is little more to be done locally than has been possible in the past, unfortunately, with little or no success. It is satisfactory to find a decrease this year in the numbers of slaves who have applied for manumission at the Maskat Agency, but experience of the past, and of the rest Gulf littoral north of Maskat territory makes it unsafe to share fully the Political Agent's sanguine belief that the African trade to Oman has ceased to exist, or that there is any great diminution in the export of enslaved Mekranis from the Persian shore. VIII.—TRUCIAL OMAN. The affairs of the Trucial Coast Chiefs and their future are problems of yearly increasing difficulty. Unlike the Shaikhs of Mahommerah and Koweit, and I may almost say of Bahrein, who seem able to a considerable extent to adapt their ideas to the changing requirements of advancing time and civilisation, the Chiefs of the old 44 pirate' coast appear to feel privileged both to stand still in spite of the spread of civilisation around them, and to remain, like pampered children, immune from any obligation to make return to the parent government for the benevolent maintenance of their principalities and independent status for close on a century. Apart from the more serious questions, referred to in this year's report, such as those regarding their national flag, or the institution of a post-office, even a simple request made to them by the Eesidency Agent with full explana- nations for their family pedigrees, for inclusion in the Government gazetteer, was resented as a dangerous innovation and the information refused him. It was not until the Eesident on a subsequent visit to the coast, showed the Chiefs^ that he had already got most of the information without their assistance, and only needed to verify it, that they were brought to realise the unreasonable ness of their attitude and to give the required details. For the last year or two owing to the undesirability of raising inconvenient issues, it has been necessary to pursue a very cautious policy with these Trucial Chiefs and to humour their primitive weaknesses, but should the political horizon of the Persian Gulf clear sufficiently to render such a course unobjectionable there are several matters in regard to which they badly need to be shown the error of their ways. It is interesting to record that a handsomely bound copy of their treaty engagements with the British Government, prefaced by Lord Curzon's speech to the Shaikhs in Darbar during his viceregal visit to Shargah in November 1903, in which the history of our relations with them is clearly set forth, was presented to each Shaikh during the year; a useful measure which will leave them little excuse for the non-acquaintance with details of treaty engagements of which they are frequently inclined to give evidence. IX.—BAHREIN. Bahrein has had a comparatively calm and uneventful year. On thb one hand the Political Agent has gradually established a good understanding with^ REVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP. the Shaikh, which is now as cordial as it is ever likely to be in the case of Shaikh Esa ; on the other hand the atmosphere prevalent in the sphere of general politics has made it advisable for us to postpone forward action for the time through out the Gulf region, and, in Bahrein, to leave for a more convenient juncture the disposal of several important questions which might otherwise have been fpund possible of earlier adjustment. The Political Agent's report is comprehensive and calls for little detailed comment. It will be noted with satisfaction that the volume of trade of the port of Manama is still on the increase; but that the pearl market last season was very slack, with the result that several large speculators in pearls from Bahrein and the Arab Coast lost heavily, including Shaikh Jasim bin Thani of Katar who is believed to have bought pearls, with borrowed money to the value of 80 lakhs of rupees and to have burnt his fingers badly in getting rid of them. Ahmed bin Salman, the notorious outlaw of the Bahrein family, still flourishes undismayed, but during the past season did not succeed in effecting any serious depredations. It is unsatisfactory to find that Bahrein is quickly establishing its reputa tion as a convenient entrepot for the distribution of contraband arms through the small ports of the Persian littoral. No doubt there was always reason to believe that a certain amount of arms did filter across from Bahrein, but the investigations of the past year indicate that in spite of the disingenuous complaint in connection with the Arms Trade formulated by Shaikh Esa in the memorial submitted by him to Government in October 1906, an organised industry on a considerable scale now exists, and even warrant the conjecture that the existence of this lucrative contraband trade not only in arms but other highly taxed or contraband articles is one of the main factors of Shaikh Esa's extraordinary un willingness to allow any supervision or revision of his Customs Administration even on terms which prima facie would be extremely advantageous to him. Shaikh Ali bin Ahmed after repeated but ineffectual endeavours to obtain permission to return to Bahrein appears now to have become more resigned to exile; and certainly little interest is taken in his affairs in Bahrein itself. X.—KOWEIT. Hitherto our policy in regard to Koweit has necessarily been conducted on cautious and indulgent lines, the endeavours of the local officers being directed towards gaining the Shaikh's personal confidence and gradually strengthening British influence with him and his subjects; rather on the prin ciple of casting bread upon the waters that it may return to us again when we are more in need of it. Meanwhile Shaikh Mubarak maintains his reputa tion as the most astute and longsighted chief in these waters, and although he is undoubtedly inclined to be capricious in business matters, it is impossible for the Resident and Political Agent to maintain with him that influence which may at any moment prove an important asset, except by taking the risk of imposing a certain measure of frank confidence in his good faith and in the continued existence in his mind of the firm belief that his interests are identical with those of the British Government and that he must look to them for advice and support in his difficulties. , So far, in spite of some minor disappointments and occasional scares, generally emanating from Turkish sources, he has not given serious, cause for anxiety, and though his absence from Koweit last year (ostensibly in connection with the grie vous illness of his son) during Admiral Sir Edmund Poe's visit was no doubt open to misconstruction, yet the exceedingly frank and substantial welcome which he accorded to Commodore Sir George Warrender and the Resident just after the close of the present year shows clearly enough that our relations with him are fundamentally healthy and our policy towards him directed along the right lines. For the same reasons that have influenced us in other directions, all delicate external questions affecting Koweit have been left in convenient abeyance. Thus it is that the Shaikh's jurisdiction in the direction of the Khor Ab dullah still remains undefined and that exiguous Turkish garrisons are stillEE VIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. $ maintained unchallenged at Umkasr and on Bubian Island. How long we can afford to continue ignoring the latter without prejudice to Mubarak's in terests and our own is a question which no doubt occupies the attention of his Majesty's Government. The all important topic of the Baghdad Railway is naturally never long absent from the sphere of discussion and gossip, but no concrete evidences of the advancement of the project have been apparent at the Gulf end, and at all events there have been no active signs of German interest or intrigue in Koweit. On the other hand we know that the subject has been closely watched and periodically discussed in those of the Chanceries of Europe which are at all inter ested and^ I should mention that just at the close of the year the arrival of a party of Turkish officials at Fao and some land measuring operations with which they busied themselves, were locally attributed to the investigation of a project for cutting a canal across the Fao angle from the Shatt-el-Arab to the Khor Ab dullah, in order to avoid the 'bar.' It is also worth recording in this connection that the R.I.M.S. Investigator in December 1906 made an interesting examination of the Khor Zobeir, finding 3 fathoms of water to a point within 11 or 12 miles of Bussorah and Mahom- merah. The advice given to the Shaikh to introduce a special flag for Koweit or a distinctive device on the Star and Crescent which he now flies, which would enable the identity of dhows hailing from his territories to be recognised, has not in the end been followed. Mubarak always expressed his inability for fear of reprisal from the Turkish authorities, to introduce an entirely new flag, or to adopt any superscription on the present one in the Roman character, but after discuss ing various devices with the Resident he provisionally approved the superscrip tion of the word ' Koweit' in Arabic, written diagonally across an angle of the flag. By the time however that a batch of properly made bunting specimens had been prepared for him to enable him to introduce the change, his apprehen sions of Turkish displeasure again got the better of him and he would not ven ture upon the introduction of the revised pattern without a written guarantee to the effect that the British Government were prepared to afford his dhows immunity from possible ill-treatment by the Turkish authorities by reason of its use. His Majesty's Government on being referred to considered that the slight advantage to be gained by the change of flag did not warrant such a guarantee being given and decided not to pursue the matter. During the 12 months under report the Nejd arena has been comparatively free from strife on any large scale, mainly no doubt owing to the death during the year of two successive representatives of the ' Bin Rashid ' family. The fall of Abdul Aziz ' bin Rashid ' which took place in April 1906 and found brief mention in last year's review is recorded more fully by Major Knox in his present report. His son and successor Muta'ab, a youth scarcely out of his teens, was not left long in the enjoyment of his precarious inheritance, meeting with his death in cold blood at the hands of his cousin. Sultan bin Hamood. The latter whose barbarous treachery is said to have so disgusted his own father Hamood as to drive him into voluntary exile at Medina, had not up to the end of the year begun to offer any serious opposition to the dominant influence of Bin Saood; meanwhile the Wahabi Amir had boasted himself sufficiently secure in his tri bal position to repeat with increased assurance, through ,his friends. Shaikh Mubarak of Koweit, and Shaikh Jasim bin Thani of Katar, overtures for some form of British recognition which he made direct to the Resident three years ago but to which no reply was then considered expedient. The specific nature of his pre sent appeal seems of sufficient interest to be placed on record. In effect he claimed that he had now completed the vanquishment of his rivals and that as far as Arab foes or competitors were concerned he felt in an unassailable position as ruler of Nejd: furthermore he even professed to be con fident of fulfilling his ambitions in the direction of clearing the hated Turk out of Central Arabia altogether and of occupying the coast line himself. On the other hand he realised that it might be difficult for him to keep his enemies permanently at a distance as long as they had the freedom of the sea and were at liberty to pour troops and guns into the country through ports of the Arab littoral, such as Katif and Ojair. Supposing therefore that the 3147 r. D. o10 REVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF» succeeded in establishing himself at the coast, could not the British Government he argued, come to an understanding with him which would give him the benefit of the maritime Truce of which they were the time-honoured custodians and as in the case of Shaikh Mubarak, afford him immunity against attack from the Turks by sea? As for the interior he expressed himself sanguine of his ability to cope with any attempted Turkish advance, whether from Shammar in the north or the Hejaz in the west. With fresh experience of the great trepidation inevitably caused among the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast by threatened or actual attempts on the part of an unfriendly Wahabi Ruler in Nejd to re-establish the position of his forebears in Oman, and the practical difficulties resulting therefrom to the 'Residency and the Grovemment of India, of which last year's Administration reports record suffi- cient indication and while deprecating the conclusion of any specific agreement with the Wahabi on the lines now desired by him, the Resident would have welcomed from some points of view the inauguration of such friendly intercourse as would have made possible the exchange of friendly and informal communications with Bin Saood when occasion arose, whether in regard to Trucial Coast matters, piracies or other commercial or administrative questions in connection with which the Arab might be expected to be concerned or helpful. His Majesty's Govern- ment however after fully considering the problem decided that there was not sufficient justification for any departure from the policy of absolute aloofness hitherto pursued by them in regard to the affairs of Nejd, and determined to make no specific response to Bin Saood's present representation. The Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein were accordingly directed to let Shaikhs Mubarak and Jasim bin Thani know when opportunity offered, that the overtures of Bin Saood received through them, were not such as could be entertained by His Majesty's Government. It will be noted from Major Knox's report that for the present Nejd is almost clear of Turkish troops; and indeed the same ill success which the Porte has experienced in Yemen may be said to have hitherto attended them on a smaller scale in Central Arabia. But the rapid advance of the Hejaz Railway Line is gradually outflanking Nejd from the west, while the darkening shadow of the Baghdad Railway threa tens from the north. So it is difficult to see at present how in the absence of gome diversion in its favour. Central Arabia is to escape ultimate absorption by the Turk. This is a problem upon which it is perhaps needless to speculate here, suffice it to say that the fortunes of Bin Saood and of Nejd will as time goes on be watched with lively and increasing concern by every native ruler on the shore of the Arab Peninsula from Maskat to Koweit. A review of Koweit affairs can hardly be complete without a reference to the Arms Traffic, of which however the Political Agent's report gives no special details. It is one of those important questions, a convenient juncture for promi nently raising which, for the reasons before stated, has not yet arrived. There is un fortunately no room for doubt that the Shaikh's prohibition is entirely a dead letter, and that the introduction of arms into Koweit is actively encouraged; but the problem cannot be considered or dealt with independently of the cog nate question originating with Maskat, and probably pending the meeting of the promised conference of 1908 it will be wisest to postpone any formal dis cussion of the question with the Shaikh. The results of that conference will doubtless demonstrate the lines on which future measures for the suppression of the traffic can best be directed. 1 P. Z.

B ushire. The administrative year opened auspiciously with the arrival at Bushire of , His Excellency, Vice-Admiral Sir Edmund isit of th .6 A mira. Poe, K.C.V.O., Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, in his Flagship, H. M. S. Hermes. His Excellency's tour was in every way successful and was marred by no unpleasant incident. At Bushire visits were exchanged with the Governor (His Excellency the Darya Begi) who acceded to the Resident's suggestion that he should call officially Upon the Admiral on the Flagship, instead of at the Residency as heretofore ; and on the Admiral's return visit treated His Excellency with every distinction and had him escorted back to the Sabzabad Residency by some 50 Sowars. The Foreign representatives, apparently pursuing the doctrine which they are always disposed to cultivate, of not recognising the status of the Government of India in Persia, refused an invitation from the Resident to an official dinner party to Sir Edmund Poe and Staff, but met His Excellency at a garden party at the Sabzabad Residency on the following day, and subsequently the Russian Consul-General, among others of the commit nity, availed themselves of the Admiral's kind invitation to lunch on the Flagship. On the conclusion of his visit Sir EdmUnd Poe proceeded to BUssorah in R. I. M. S. Lawrence, and having met the Flagship again on emerging from the Shatt-el-Arab visited Koweit and Bahrein accompanied by the Resident. A short visit was also paid to the Khor Abdullah. In matters connected with the Customs Administration, under the regime of Monsieur Heynsseng, the Residency had Customs. ■ i i . • j . -| every reason as last year to appreciate the conciliatory attitude both of the Director and his Assistant, Monsieur Constant, and there has been an entire absence of friction. Unfortunately Monsieur Heynssens* somewhat austere methods in dealing with the native element excited the hostility of the Persian public, and in August a dispute between his staff and some of the local lightermen having been taken up by certain Mullahs a protracted feud was started which primarily accounted for the transfer both of the Darya Begi and of Monsieur Heynssens from Bushire a few months later. Monsieur Heynssens appears all along to have been possessed by the belief that His Excellency the Darya Begi was really the deUs ex machina of a plot against him, but though the Governor could hardly pretend to have any special regard for the Belgian Administrators since whose arrival his position has been rendered extremely subservient and undignified, there was little apparent evidence either in His Excellency's conduct or conversation to lend corroboration to Monsieur Heyns- sens' suspicions. Relations however gradually became so strained that it was clearly impossible that Bushire should continue to hold both officials and shortly afterwards (apparently owing to the representations of Monsieur Naus who had framed a vehement indictment against the Darya Begi as an arch smuggler) it transpired that His Excellency was about to be replaced by Haji Saeed-es- Change of Governors. Sultaneh, lately Chief-of-Police in Tehran. It was not however until 30th January that after the interchange of numerous communications with Tehran His Excellency finally left for the capital. Calling at the Residency just before his departure he expressed the belief that the swing of the pendulum would soon bring him back. His successor, a young man hailing from Northern Persia and possessing no previous experience of Government or of Persian Gulf conditions and politics, though friendly in his bearing, gave no promise up to the end of the year of making a successful Governor. 3147 f. d. c oSgf-f 12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP Throughout the second half of the period the daily life of Bushire was Local Politics and Majlis. stantly racked by the petty local dissen sions which, as m most other townshim * Persia, have resulted from the introduction of the^Constitution and the insff f- of local branches of the Majlis-i-Milli or ' National Assembly ' of Tehran 1 n It was on the 7th October 1906 that His Majesty Muzuffer-ud-din Sh K inaugurated the National Assembly at the capital in the presence of the /i dignitaries of the Court and Foreign representatives, but it was not until November that the Darya Begi held a Meeting at Government House, Bush' before which was read the Royal Firman constituting that august institution Jj+ji branches in provincial towns. His Excellency informed his hearers that it proposed to select three members from the Gulf Ports who would each receive^ allowance of 1,000 Tomans per annum. He further stated that a local committee^ ' class ' representatives should be formed and should meet once a week at Gover ment House to advise on local claims and complaints and he added that it would be incumbent upon him to act in harmony with their views. As the result of this pronouncement the Local Committee seemed to have imbibed the idea that their functions were intended to supersede those of the Governor in all local matters and the Governor took advantage of their vagaries to do nothing. The result was that innumerable petty routine cases usual in a large town like Bushire accumulated to a serious extent; no one got relief, and Bushire may be said to have existed without Government. Matters were further conmli. cated by the attitude of the Mullahs ; realising that the effect of the existence of a local assembly, if it performed the functions expected of it, would take away half the custom and perquisites on which their livelihood depended, they demanded to be made members. The position was still further confounded by the unsettled state of affairs at the capital resulting from the lingering illness of Mozuffer-ud-din Shah. The news of His Majesty's demise however when it did come, on 9th January had been so long expected and so often wrongly reported, that it was received very calmly by the public and was accompanied by none of those disturbances peculiar to such occasions. Fortunately His Majesty'died at a time when the Nomad Tribes were settled in their winter quarters far away from the Bushire-Shiraz Road and though the long illness of His Majesty and the chaotic state of the Government for months past had inevitably resulted in a good deal of turbulence throughout the province generally, no special manifestations of it now ensued. What there was, was chiefly focussed at the head-quarters of the Fars Government and is fully dealt with m Mr. Grahame's account of Shiraz history for the year. Soon after the proclamation of constitutional Government the question of the National Bank. formation of a National Bank was mooted ■p -i • , r „ and keenly taken up for the time by the Bushire public on paper at all events. The leading Persian merchants appeared to v^ with each other m giving circulation to exaggerated reports of the munificent extent to which their patriotism had prompted them to promise contribution for the maintenance of the national credit, but by the end of the year the popularity pf the idea with the Bushiris had considerably waned. In spite of the enormous amount of smuggling which the heavy tariff has Commerce. generated the trade of Bushire has flourished i T/ i . . during the past year and fortunately there nave been no epidemics to exercise any damaging effect upon it. The Arms Traffic continues to give the Customs authorities an immense amount of anxiety it being found impossible to check the illicit import through the small ports of the Persian littoral. r x-rf 0 p r sea-going launches built at the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard i 6 j r j ian .i 0V f5 n ^ en v w 1 ere during the year, but owing to the general chaos and dearth of funds little use has as yet been made of them.

Herr Wonckhaus, who has been the pioneer of German trade in the Persian Gulf, has naturally become the chief agent and patron of the line. Their opera tions have been somewhat facilitated by the extremely irregular sailings of our own British Lines, which undoubtedly require to bestir themselves, if they intend to prevent the German Line from picking up their clients. Though it is doubtless an expensive procedure the latter are a sufficiently wealthy company to make their sailings from home regular, whether they can fill their ships or not; whereas ouf own lines apparently do not let their vessels leave home until they have secured the full amount of cargo required. An offer made by them to the British Indian Steam Navigation Company to share with them the cost of the upkeep of the Shatt-el-Arab ' Bar' buoys, an overture which was politely declined, is an interesting indication of their serious intentions in the direction of enterprise in the Gulf. The entry of Germany into competition for the Gulf carrying trade has . naturally caused her movements to be German activity. , i. . , . . .., regarded with suspicion, with what serious reason it is as yet difficult to say. Thus in June 1906 a positive report was communicated to his journal by a British newspaper correspondent in Con- Reported desire to acquire Halool Island. stantinople to the effect that Germany was negociating with the Porte for the acquisi tion of the Island of Halool in the Persian Gulf, a tiny islet to which the nearest point of land is the extremity of the Katar promontory of the Arab Coast. She was said to contemplate using it as a coaling station for German ships. The islet in question is not far removed from the track of steamers passing between Eas Mussendum and Bahrein, and is situated at the edge of the Great Pearl Bank. Curiously enough it is the only one of the numerous islands in the deep waters of the Gulf to the possession of which the Porte might conceivably formulate a colourable claim based on the ground that the nearest mainland to the island is the coast of Katar, over which the Porte pretends to claim sovereignty, which however we have always declined to recognise. It is frequented by Dhows from Bahrein and A1 Bida the port on the Katar Coast, in summer by pearlers needing shelter from the Shamal gales from which it affords good protection, and in winter by fishermen from the same two localities. Nothing further has been heard of the alleged German intention, and may never be ; but it is difficult to understand the occurrence in Constantinople of specific rumours regarding such a little known and insignificant islet, unless it had actually attracted attention in certain quarters, and it seems possible that the publicity given to the report may have been sufficient to stifle any negociations that may have been on foot. The record of the acquisition by Herr Wonckhaus of certain exclusive rights . on Abu Musa Island, though it rightly u usa oncession. belongs to the Trucial Coast Keport may preferably be recorded here as an item of German commercial activity. In July 1906 on return from a short visit to Simla on duty the Kesident received information to the effect that Herr Wonckhaus had subleased the Island of Abu Musa from one Hassan Samaiyeh of Lingah, who with two associates enjoyed from -the Shaikh of Shargah a concession for the quarrying of Red Oxide on his island possession. Confidential inquiries made at Lingah elicited the fact that the con cession had not been actually transferred but that Hassan Samaiyeh had, in a con tract drafted in English, given Herr WonckhaUs a monopoly of the output for a period Of four years with right to renew. There was reason however to suppose from Hassan Samaiyeh's secretive behaviour that he had come to this understanding with Herr Wonckhaus's representative without the knowledge of the third partner ift the Concession, (viz., Esa bin Abdul Latif of Shargah) and again without the con-, currence of the Shaikh of Shargah, the sovereign of the Island. The Government of India accordingly directed that inquiries be made from the Shaikh on this point, and that he be reminded of the trouble to which Government had been put on his account to recover the Island for him in 1904 after it had |been unwarrantably invaded by the Director-General of Customs at Bushire on hehalf of the Persian14 ADMMSTRATIOtf REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP Government, and the flag of the Trucial Arabs unceremoniously hauled down It proved, as was expected that neither the Shaikh nor the third concessionaire had any idea of the precise terms of the contract entered into by Hassan Samaiyeh • and on hearing them the former immediately indited a letter to Hassan cancelling the concession, while Esa bin Abdul Latif at the same time wrote repudiating the contract entered into with Herr Wonckhaus, on the ground that he had not been in any way consulted before the fact. The complaint of the Shaikh to the Eesidency asking for the support of Government in effecting the annulment of this undesirable contract, and the appeal of Hassan Samaiyeh, as a British protected person, against the Shaikh's arbitrary action, were duly referred to Government for orders. Until they were received Shaikh Sagar was advised to take no further action towards making tfnod his intentions and the matter remained at this stape until the close of the yrar, the views of His Majesty's Government not having yet been received. Mr. Hatinouglou, the Levantine Greek representing the ' Sponge Exploration Sponge Exploration Syndicate. Syndicate Limited ' of London, mentioned on page 17 01 last year s report, was rein- forced in June, as expected, by a party of 7 Greek divers from the Mediterranean and with them conducted diving operations in the vicinity of Hormuz, Larak, and Kharag Islands ; but apparently with indifferent success. He indeed professed to have found sponges of fine quality, especially off Kharag, but after a short time his divers fell out with one another and with him, and more over proved unable to work in the great heat of the Gulf summer. He accordingly sent them home during August and followed himself at the end of that month threatening to return with more in three months' time. He had not done so up to the close of the year, but from letters written by him to friends at Bushire it appeared that he was then in London and that his Syndicate, which only started with a modest capital of £1,000, is trying to enlist more capital, and the sympa thies of His Majesty's Government in their venture. The report of Doctor Theodore Thomson. Public Health Quarantine. anticipated in last year's review was re ceived in due course. He failed to see the necessity or advantage of the formation of any international -detention station at Henjam or other port in the southern portion of the Gulf, but while holding that the ports below Bunder Abbas on the Mekran Coast, owing to the absence of free communication with the north and the thinly populated and arid character of the hinterland, actually constituted little or no source of danger, he was on the other hand of opinion that the ports in the northern portion of the Gulf needed to be strongly and effectively held. He further made several recom mendations for the improvement of the existing quarantine stations, which are now under consideration with a view to being carried into effect as far as local circum stances permit. The Persian Government having notified its acceptance of the provisions of the Paris International Sanitary Convention of 1903 in this regard the period of quarantine detention imposed upon ships hailing from plague infected ports was reduced from 10 to 5 days with effect from March 6th, 1907. Owing to the jealously vigilant and captious attitude assumed by foreign representatives and nationalists towards the working arrangements of the Quarantine Service as administered by the British Residency Surgeon, it has been found advisable during the past year to make several concessions to their suscepti bilities. Thus the British Quarantine Medical Officers now f[y the Persian Flag while on duty in harbour instead of the Union Jack as heretofore; the Persian or French languages are used exclusively for all correspondence and intercourse instead of English, while the Residency Surgeon deals direct, qua Persian Official, with the President of the Sanitary Council at Tehran in all matters connected with his Quarantine duties. Although by these means it has been possible to a great extent to disarm un friendly criticism, it is nevertheless to be expected that the task which the Govern ment of India have wisely imposed upon themselves in the direction of financing and administering Persian Gulf Quarantine Administration will continue to prove an increasingly difficult and delicate one,.POLITICAL RESIDENCY fOR 1906-1907. 15 Fortunately the year remained immune from any visitation of epidemic disease. The state of the Bushire-Shiraz Eoad has been deplorable almost throughout ^ o . 1 the year, and the subiect is dealt with fully ushire- hiraz oa . j n ]\j r&lt; Grahame's memorandum. The choice between the alternative methods of approach to Bushire from the Borasjoon stage, 30 miles distant, formed from time to time as it frequently has in the past, a convenient opportunity for wire-pulling and corruption for persons with vested interests in the one or the other. At the end of the year the Ahmedi or land route was in vogue. Kahdari in one form or another still Rahdan. continues to be levied on the road, the authorities being powerless to stop it. On the other hand in many instances, they make no attempt to do so, and even have the temerity to include the receipts from certain purely illegal transit dues in their schedules of annual revenue to be collected by provincial Grovernors, Little was effected during the year in the direction of the settlement of old Bushire claims against the Persian Grovern- Settiement of claims ment, owing both to the fluid state of affairs in Tehran and to the financial diffi culties in which the Persian Government were known to be submerged. The special Mamur promised by the Central Government never got further than Shiraz, where however he did assist in settling some items. The oft-mentioned Taona case has remained unsettled and still continues to be a source of discontent and dudgeon to the Shaikh of Abu Thabi. Instructions were indeed issued by the Foreign Office to His Majesty's Minister to ask the Persian Government to give this matter their attention, but no result ensued. A suggestion from Mr. Grahame that the Kowam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz, the farmer of the district which includes Taona, should assign to the Shaikh of Abu Thabi interests of some kind in the Island of Kais, which the Kowam is said to have received as an absolute gift from His Majesty Nasir-ud-din Shah, deserves mention but was not considered by the Government of India to admit of practical adoption. The Resident was frequently on tour in the Lawrence during the year in Tourg connection with the collection of Gazetteer information or the conduct of ordinary busi ness, and visited all the ports of the Arab and Trucial Coasts, but no special land tours were undertaken. g laves Five manumission certificates were granted by the Residency during the year. Officials' changes. 0 T l e f were ^ chan g es ^ tlie Residency IStaii during the year. In May Captain de V. Condon, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon, proceeded home on furlough and was succeeded by Captain T. B. Williams, I.M.S., previously Consular Surgeon at Kermanshah. In July Mr. J. H. Bill, I.C.S., took over the duties of First Assistant Resident from Captain A. P. Trevor on the latter obtaining furlough to Europe. In March 1907 Mr, R. L. Laffere was appointed Assistant Engineer in charge of Government buildings and works in the Persian Gulf with head-quarters at Bushire. The creation of this appointment was found necessary owing to the numerous Government buildings now existing or in course of construction at the several Agencies within the sphere of the Residency. There was also a change in the personnel of His Majesty's Consulate-General. Mr. Richards, Vice-Consul, proceeding on leave to England in May and being subse quently transferred to Zanzibar, was succeeded in December by Mr. H. G. Chick, late Student Interpreter in His Majesty's Legation at Tehran. During the interval between Mr. Richards' departure and Mr. Chick's promotion and arrival, the Vice- Consular duties were carried on by the First Assistant. Monsieur Passek, Consul-General for Russia, proceeded on six months' leave in Foreign Representatives. Ma y bein g replaced by Monsieur Andre Miller, hitherto Vice-Consul. On the ter mination of his leave Monsieur Passek was placed on special duty at the Russian16 amimistraflon report of the persian gulp Legation in Tehran in connection witk the Anglo-Russian negociations; and Monsieur Miller remained in charge. Monsieur Boris Miller, Secretary of the Russian Consulate-General, proceeded to Shiraz in March to represent Russian interests at that place. Dr. Listemann, Acting Consul for Germany, left for Tehran in February to replace a member of his Legation proceeding on leave. No arrangements for the representation of Germany in the meanwhile were notified to his colleagues. Monsieur Chaloin, French Vice-Consul, still remained absent from his post, Mirza Ali Reza Khan continuing in charge of French interests. There was a normal rainfall of approximately nine inches. The results of tlie daily observations are recorded in tabular servatory. statements Nos. 1 and 2 attached. S hiraz (Fars.) (Furnislied by Mr. George Grahame, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz.) The after-effects of the agitation which broke out in Shiraz in the autumn of 1905 in consequence of the opposition and rapacity of Prince Shuaa'-ul-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Fars, and his followers, continued to be felt during the year 1906-1907 both in Shiraz and the province of Fars. Merging into the general wave of the Persian Constitutional movement — of which indeed it would appear to have been a premonitory signal—this agitation created a kind of ground- swell which reacted unfavourably on the general conditions of the province. Rumours which obtained as far back as May 1906 of the serious illness and at times of the death of the Shah ; the acceptance by Mozuffer-ud-din Shah in October 1906 of a constitutional form of government; the popular movements in Tehran,^ Tabriz, and other towns of Persia, in connection with the acceptance and realisation by Mozuffer-ud-din Shah and subsequently by his successor, of that form of govern ment ; the election of provincial deputies,—all these were elements which combined to increase the feeling of unrest prevalent in Fars in the spring of 1906 and tamaJ^e the year one of storm and stress. It is worthy of note that the demise (long discounted in advance) of Mozuffer- ud-din Shah on 8th January 1907 passed unmourned and all but unmarked in Shi mz changes of local authorities. ' The year under review was notable for no less than four administrative periods, viz,— February—June 1906 . . .. .. Vazier-i-Makhsous. July— November 1906 . . ., .. Ala -ul -Dowleh.

Kowam-ul-Mulk, Vazier of Fars, appointed February 1907, arrived Shiraz 1st March 1907. Nebil-ul-Sultaneh, who took up the appointment of Karguzar of Fars in Jan uary 1907, continued to hold that post throughout the year under review. His ignorance, incapacity and, on one occasion, marked discourtesy have given rise to frequent complaints on the part of His Majesty 's Consulate. provincial politics. During the year 1906-1907 political considerations, chiefly of a purely local nature, swamped all others and called for constant vigilance. The Vazier-i-Makhsous who had reached Shiraz about mid-February 1906 continued to hold office as High Commissioner and Governor-General in posse until mid -JuDe. The nondescript nature of his powers, jointly with a total lack of experience in administrative matters, stultified his good intentions. His timePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 17 of office was passed, firstly in dislodging the Sardar-i-Akram, ex-Vazier of Fars, other followers and the family of Prince Shuaa'-ul-Sultaneh ; secondly in the endeavour to settle the burning question at issue between His Highness Shuaa'-ul- Sultaneh and the people of Fars regarding certain Crown lands—including as was contended the main bazaar of Shiraz — purchased by the Prince from the Shah in 1905. It was not till 7th April that His Highness's family left Shiraz for Tehran. On the same date the Sardar-i-Akram quitted the town. The question regarding the lands in Fars, claimed by the Prince to have been acquired by him, continued to rage till the autumn, giving rise in its course to the first of a series of drama tic appeals by the Persian people to representatives of His Majesty's Govern ment. In June this question had reached white heat. On 9th June a body of 300 to 400 inhabitants of Shiraz including a large number of Persian notables and mer chants entered the Residency gardens and announced their intention of remaining in ' bast ' till their grievances were redressed, and definite assurances given to them through His Majesty's Legation that Prince Shuaa'-ul-Sultaneh would neither return to Fars or continue to hold land there. The crowd of ' bastis ' which was estimated at times to number about 1,000, continued to occupy the Residency garden till 21st June, on the evening of which they withdrew, ostensibly at the command of Mirza Ibrahim, only partially re-assured by the news conveyed to them from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires that Ala-ud-Dowleh had been appointed Governor-General of Fars with full powers to deal with the question of Prince Shuaa'-ul-Sultaneh's properties in Fars. Ala-ul-Dowleh, who reached Shiraz on the 4th July, acclaimed by a show of popular enthusiasm, found himself burdened with the difficult task of acting as an arbitrator between the people of Fars and Prince Shuaa'-ul-Sultaneh, the favourite son of Mozuffer-ud-din Shah. The Royal rescript which His Excellency exhibited conferring on him full powers to settle this question was destined to be rendered almost a dead letter by the intrigues of the Prinoe and his followers in Tehran and in Fars. At the outset however, on 10th July, he was able to announce to the people of Shiraz that His Majesty the Shah had been graciously pleased to renounce all claim to the Bazaar-i-Vakil, which was to remain, as before, the property of the numerous private individuals who claimed a vested interest in it. • The five months of Ala-ul-Dowleh's administration were spent, chiefly in negociations to bring about an equitable settlement of the grievances of the people of Fars; partly in the endeavour to re-establish a semblance of order on the Bushire road where brigandage combined with the exactions and insolence of the road-guards had created a most unsatisfactory, state of things. In both these difficult questions His Excellency was partially successful. Espousing the cause of the people against the Prince, he exposed the fraud and oppression practised by the Sardar-i-Akram, ex-Vazier of Fars, and other followers of His Highness. His efforts paved the way to a subsequent arrange ment by which the lands purchased by the Prince reverted to the Crown. Under his administration, the Bushire and other roads enjoyed for a time a measure of security. A Persian of the old school, with, at heart, a distrust and a dislike for ail foreigners, Ala-ul-Dowleh displayed at the outset a strong personal hostility to His Majesty's Consul, and it required much patience and long endeavours to win him over to the very friendly attitude which he eventually assumed. The intrigues of Prince Shuaa'ul-Sultaneh and his personal influence with the Shah, his father, led to the recall to Tehran about mid-November of Ala-ul-Dowleh. His recall gave rise to a somewhat theatrical display of popular feeling in his favour. The masses, not unprompted, as may be surmised, surrounded the palace; the clergy and notables mounted guard over the person of the Governor-General declar ing that they would not allow him to quit Shiraz. At one moment it seemed there would be another popular movement in the direction of His Majesty's Consulate. After three or four days spent in the exchange of telegrams between Tehran and Shiraz, Ala-ul-Dowleh, on the receipt of a peremptory message from the Shah, rode off about midnight between the 20th and 21st November with a few followers. 3147 P. D. ' n18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The latter part of his administration had been marked by a recrudescen road robberies, due—as His Excellency asserted—to the machinations of his enenV In the town efforts at the election of representatives for the National Assembl ' Tehran were being fitfully made. Rumours of the Shah's precarious conditi ln at times of his demise, became more persistent. Reports of disturbances in Teh ^ Tabriz, and other large towns were rife. ran ' It was reasonably expected that the removal of the strong hand of Ala 1 Dowleh would be followed by a period of unrest. The events belied this forec f In the interregnum of three months which intervened between the departure of Al ul-Dowleh and the appointment of Prince Moayyid-ul-Dowleh Shiraz had a ' history. The administration of the Prince, confided to the joint care, at first ^ Salar-ul-Sultan (elder son of Kowam-ul-Mulk), Beglerbegi (Lord Mayor) of Shiraz and Khabir-ul-Dowleh, Superintendent of the Persian Telegraph Office, subse quently, to the former in conjunction with his younger brother, Nasr-ul-Dowleh was carried on satisfactorily. ' A greater degree of security was maintained on the road, though the exactions of the road-guards on the Bushire road continued and furnished cause for numerous complaints. The death of the Shah which occurred on the 8th January gave rise to none of those evil after-effects which had been confidently predicted. The sinister shadow which this event had cast before it vanished with the event itself. Others however darkened the prospect. The alleged hostility of Mahomed Ali Shah to a constitu tional regime and the apprehensions of the National Assembly gave rise in Tehran to a tension which found its counterpart in Shiraz as in other leading towns of Persia. New elements tending to discord had appeared in Shiraz. The establish ment of a local assembly (Majlis-i-Milli) was shortly afterwards followed by that of a body styled Anjuman-i-Islam (the Moslem League) largely composed of turbulent 4 ' tullab,'' Efforts to elect representatives from Ears for the National Assembly at Tehran continued without any definite result. About the 11th Eebruary the news of the appointment of Prince Moayyid-ul- Dowleh as Governor-General of Ears, with Kowam-ul-Mulk as Vazier, became publicly known in Shiraz. The latter who j ointly with his kinsman Nasir-ul-Mulk had been detained in Tehran since the autumn of 1905, by the Persian Government at the instigation of Prince Shuaa'ul-Sultaneh reached Shiraz on 1st March, and was received with a popular ovation. Shortly after his return his younger son Nasr-ul-Dowleh was appointed ' Reis-i-Qoushoun ' of Ears. The Kowam-ul- Mulk's party seemed to be firmly established in power, and it was obvious that Moayyid-ul-Dowleh was destined to be a mere figure-head, while Kowam-ul-Mulk would continue to be the '' uncrowned king '' of Ears. There were however rumours of widespread discontent throughout the province. The Kowam-ul-Mulk was known to have paid a very large sum (according to reliable report Ts. 1^00,000) for his release from Tehran. It was naturally presumed that he would endeavour to recoup himself out of the province. It was commonly believed that he had entered into an agreement with the Shah to use all his influence to quash the constitutional movement in Ears. A little local newspaper, the Nida-i-Islam,'' the first number of which appea red on the 11th of March 1907, and the continuous distribution of inflammatory appeals, purporting to come from Tabriz and Tehran, to the patriotism of the Shirazis helped to fan the embers of discord in the town. Exaggerated rumours promoted unrest throughout the outlying districts. Dissensions among the Kashgai chiefs, and the rancour of his brothers towards Soulat-ul-Dowleh, the Ilkhani, portended trouble in the tribe. The outlook at the end of March was dark, and it was predicted that the advent 0 ^ 1 i eW ^ 0 ^ eril0r ^ enera ^ w ^ 10 was ex P ec ^ e( i to reach Shiraz early in April, would be the signal for an eruption of the long smouldering disaffection. COMMERCE. No statistics are available at Shiraz, but reports furnished by European firms ana ?merchants tend to show that trade, in spite of adverse conditions, was on the w ole fully up to the average. Exports would appear to have been slightly above the average, dried fruits and gum being exported in larger quantities than usual.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 19 The two following points in connection with non-British trade deserve note. In the end of March 1906 Herr Heinrich Burger travelling for the 4 ' 'Badischer Anilin und Soda Fabrik ' visited Shiraz, where he remained more than a month. He secured an order for 20 cases of synthetic indigo and gave practical illustrations to Shiraz dyers in the use of this article. It may be reasonably conjectured that the import into Fars of Indian indigo is destined to suffer from and eventually to be lolled by the introduction of German synthetic indigo. About December 1906 the Singer Sewing Machine Company opened a branch in Shiraz. The representative French subject M. Ignace Muller (formerly a teacher in the schools of the 44 Alliance de la langue Franyaise '' at Tehran) assisted by his wife, a native of Tiflis, appears to have had some success in pushing the sale of sewing machines in Shiraz and proposes to send out native agents to Jahrum, Fasa, Lar, etc. AGRICULTURE. In the districts of Fars north of Shiraz, as also in the immediate environs of the town, the grain crops of 1906 would appear to have been better than for several years past. This improvement was less noticeable in the districts south of Shiraz in some of which there had been a lack of rain. The poppy crops varied considerably according to the locality, but would appear to have been better than those of 1905. There was an unusually plentiful yield of grapes of all kinds. PUBLIC SECURITY. The condition of the Shiraz-Bushire road throughout the year was aepioraDle. Robberies, the majority apparently by tribesman, were frequent. Two brigands, Mullah Mansour and Malek Manaf, infested the district between Kazeroon and Daliki. British films suffered extensively. The Persian post was not spared. In November 1906 the Residency messenger bearing despatches from His Majesty's Legation for the Grovernment of India was held up, apparently by Kashgais. and robbed of the official despatch-bag with all its contents, of personal effects, monty, badge, etc. None of the stolen despatches, effects, etc., have been recovered; no redress given. Like several other outrages which occurred on the Bushire road at or about the same time, the robbery of the Residency messenger was alleged by the Fars authorities to have been the work of Kashgais acting under instigation of Prince Shuaa'-ul-Sultaneh with a view to discrediting Ala-ul-Dowleh. The misconduct,of the road-guards, more particularly on the portion of the road between Kazeroon and Borasjoon, who continue to levy dues from the mule teers under the name of ' tufankji-giri (guard-dues), to blackmail and in some cases assault travellers and to molest the Residency messengers, formed the subject of repeated representations from His Majesty's Consul to the Fars authorities, who however persistently ignored these. No case is known to the British Consulate of a road-guard having been punished for misconduct. The condition of the Shiraz-Ispahan road, though considerably better than that of the southern road, left much to be desired. A British missionary and his wife were the sufferers in an extensive robbery committed in June near Yezdi-kasht. No compensation or redress has been obtained from the Fars authorities who allege the robbers to have been Bakhtiari tribesmen. BRITISH CLAIMS. Owing in part to the friendly attitude which Ala-ul-Dowleh was induced to assume, in part to the presence in Shiraz for several months of the summer of a special official despatched from Tehran by the Persian Government at Mr. Grant Duff's request to settle outstanding British claims in southern Persia a large number of such claims were satisfactorily disposed of in the course of the summer. A sum of over Krans 65,000 (approximately £1,300) was received from or through the Fars authorities. Of this sum about Krans 43,900 (say £870) was for road robberies, Krans 2,400 (about £48) for burglaries in Shiraz, the remainder for loans, business-debts, petty thefts, etc. 3147 F. D20 ABMimSTRATlON REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP A certain number of cases however remained unsettled; among these several of major importance—chiefly of piracy and murder in the Persian Gulf—which had been referred to the British Consulate at Shiraz by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the numerous complaints against the road-guards, whose crown ing insolence was the holding up and exaction of blackmail from an English lady near Boras] oon in March 1906— remained unredressed despite the pressing represent ations of His Majesty's Consul. In addition to the claims above-mentioned sums amounting to over £1,000 were recovered through His Majesty's Consulate for a British firm from a British and several Persian creditors. POSTS. The transport of mails from Ispahan to Shiraz and vice versa by ' fourgons,' which in March 1906 had been made to run as far south as Pouzeh, was initiated in April 1906 and has continued. Owing to bad condition of portions of the road between Zarghan and Abadeh accidents have been frequent and the mails which are supposed to effect the transit from Ispahan to Shiraz in 5 days, sometimes in the winter months take as much as 8 or 10. The office of Postmaster (combined with that of ' Directeur de la Caisse) ' was held by M. Mirza Yantz up to the end of October 1906. He was succeeded by Yahya Mirza. TELEGRAPHS. Indo -European Telegraph Department. —The year was marked by an abnor mal amount of wilful damage—chiefly ascribed to tribesmen—compensation for which amounted to nearly 40 per cent, more than that of either of the two years immediately preceding. Assaults on dependants of the Department and violation of restrooms did not as in previous years call for the intervention of His Majesty's Consul, but in January a very glaring infringement of the inviolability of the Department premises occurred, the office at Kazeroon being invaded by a number of '' k Maamours ' despatched by Salar-ul-Sultan and Nasr-ul-Dowleh to seize the local Governor Khajeh Ibrahim who had taken refuge there. As the result of Strenuous protests the 4 ' Maamours '' were after a few days withdrawn and subsequently an apology was offered. CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY. The school of this Society maintained by the Rev. Napier Malcolm was prac tically closed in July 1906 by the threat on the part of Ala-ul-Dowleh to flog severely any boy attending it. A dispensary maintained in its stead by Mr. and Mrs. Mal colm assisted by Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Clifton (lay helpers) has been very numerously' attended, especially by the poorer classes. The ministrations of Mrs. Malcolm, who is a fully qualified practitioner, have been greatly appreciated. JEWS.—ALLIANCE ISRAELITE UNIVERSELLE. The Jewish community of Shiraz, which numbers between 5 and 6,000, is in times of disturbance generally made to suffer. An attack on the Jewish quarter is a not unusual premonitory sympton of political agitation. The Jews of Shiraz had suffered considerably in the early spring of 1906 when, under pretext of obliging them to adopt a distinctive head-dress, certain Mullahs caused them to be confined for several months to their own quarter of the town. Their position became so intolerable that in April a crowd of about 200 Jews repaired to the Consulate, but was induced to retire. The Vazier-i-Makhsous shortly afterwards obtained a relax ation of the religious orders against them, but during the rest of the year they were not immune from persecution. The harsh treatment they too frequently experi ence in Shiraz is driving many of them to emigrate to Palestine. In October 1906 M. Lahana, formerly at Ispahan, assumed the charge of the schools of the Alliance Israelite Universelle at Shiraz, assisted in this work by Mme. Lahana. SLAVES. There is certainly in Shiraz, and presumably throughout Fars, a large number of slaves, both male and female, many of whom it may be reasonably surmised bave been importd into Persia from overseas since the date and in defiance of the conven-POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 21 tion of 1882 for the suppression of traffic in slaves. Among the upper classes in Shiraz the possession of a number of slaves chiefly for the service of the ' anderoon ' is as much a mark of good taste as it was in Rome in the age of the Antonines. Since 1903 when Mr. Grahame took up the appointment of Consul at Shiraz the local authorities have exerted the utmost ingenuity to evade carrying out the stipulations of the Convention. Strong pressure locally and frequent reference to His Majesty's Minister have been necessary. During the year under review seven letters of manumission were issued by the Fars authorities at the request of His Majesty's Consul in favour of slaves who had taken refuge in the Residency. All of the slaves thus manumitted had been imported from overseas subsequent to 1882 and were claimed as property of Persian masters. TOURS. In consequence of the very unsatisfactory condition of the Shiraz-Bushire road and of the numerous complaints against the road-guards, Mr. Grahame requested and obtained sanction to make a tour of inspection on that road. Leaving Shiraz on 29th April he was absent till 3rd June. In a report subse quently submitted to His Majesty's Minister the defects of the present arrange ments for the maintenance of security on this road were set forth and certain pro posals for the patrolling of the road by Native Indian Cavalry were submitted for the consideration of His Majesty's Government. Under special instructions Mr. Grahame returned to Shiraz by the Firouzabad route. Bushire was left on the afternoon on 23rd May ; Shiraz was reached on the morning of 3rd June. The route with the exception of the portion between Ahram and Tang-i-zard, was highly satisfactory. A detailed report was subsequently furnished tending to establish the superi ority of this route over the Kazeroon road, and to show that of the two objections generally urged against it by muleteers and others, viz., lack of water and insecurity, the latter only is to a certain extent well-grounded. Travelling with his Consular escort, Mr. Grahame experienced no difficulties, but the country traversed between Ahram and Firouzabad was in a lawless condi tion, every man's hand being apparently against his neighbour, and the villagers as a rule not venturing outside their own immediate stretch of land. FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES. Since November 1905 France has been represented at Shiraz by a Consular Agent, Haji Mirza Hussein, a Persian subject. No other Foreign Power is perma nently represented. During four months of the summer of 1906 Mr. Andre Miller, Acting Russian Consul General at Bushire, accompanied by M. Boris Miller, Dragoman to that Consulate, and by Dr. Bussiere, Medical Officer to the Persian Customs Administra tion, was in residence at Shiraz. Mr. Grahame held the post of His Majesty's Consul throughout the year under review. I:/ GEORGE GRAHAME, His Britannia Majesty'&amp; Consul, Shiraz, P. Z.

A rabistan. vice-consulate affairs. 1. Througliout the year under review charge was held by Captain D. L. ^ Lorimer, I. A. Of the year 134 days were spent in broken periods at head-quarters, the remaining being occupied by the following tours :— 22nd April 1906 to 6th May 1906.—To Shushter and Dizful and back. The return journey between Shushter and Wais was effected by raft down the Shatait and Karun. 3rd June 1906 to §th November 1906.—To Ispahan and back through the Bakhtiari country. On the outward journey, Mamatain, the site selected by the Oil Syndicate for their first boring, was visited, and halts were made with the Khans at Ardal and Chighakhor. A prolonged halt was made at Julfa (Ispahan) pending the development of negotiations with the Bakhtiari Khans in Tehran. On the return journey visits were paid to the various Khans at Shalamzar, Gish- nagun and Junaghun. 11^ January 1907 31^ January 1907.—To Mamatain and back. The visit was in connection with the Khans' breach of contract as regards the supply of Guards for the Oil Works. 8th February 1907 to IZth February 1907.—To Shushter and back in connec tion with the hiring of Vice-Consular quarters there. 28th February 1907 to 21th March 1907.—To Eamuz and Mamatain visiting the Khans in connection with affairs of the Oil Syndicate. The collection and revision of information for the Persian Gulf Gazetteer has, as in the preceding year, occasioned a considerable amount of work, and requests by the Indian Intelligence Branch for information have also demanded and received attention. 2. The building of a house for the Vice-Consulate. —During the absence of the Vice-Consul at Ispahan in summer a statement of terms on which the Govern ment of India was willing to treat with Shekh Khaz'al for the acquiry of a site and the building of a Vice-Consulate was received. On 21st November, the earliest possible opportunity, an interview was od- tained with Shakh Khaz'al, but it was found quite impossible to reconcile his terms with those proposed by Government. Reference was accordingly at once made to the Government of India, but up to the time of writing no reply has been re ceived, and the situation is now likely to remain unaltered until next cold weather. 3. The Vice-Consulate medical arrangement. —A supply of medicines and instru* ments for the Vice-Consulate was received in. May. At the same time Captain Crossle, I.M.S., who had been appointed Consular Surgeon for Ahwaz and Kerman- shah, arrived from India. As he was unable to make a prolonged stay it was not possible for him to organize the Dispensary arrangelhents, and in the absence of sanction to engage special quarters, the Hospital Assistant continued to reside in the Vice-Consulate. Temporary quarters were eventually secured for him in the town in October, and in January sanction for the necessary rent having been given suitable permanent quarters were engaged for the j oint occupancy of the JIos- pital Assistant, Dispensary, and Head Clerk, of which the Hospital portion wa^ at once occupied. The Hospital Assistant has remained at head-quarters since his appointment to Ahwaz. 4. Captain Crossle accompanied the Vice-Consul through the Bakhtiari coun try to Ispahan in June and July, and attended throughout the tour to such medicalpolitical residency for 1903-1907. 25 work as was practicable under the circumstances. At Chighakhor the Khans there made considerable use of his services. 5. In February 1907 the superintending charge of the medical arrangements at Ahwaz were transferred from the hands of the Consular Surgeon at Kermanshah to those of the Kesidency Surgeon at Bushire. The present Medical Establishment consists of one Hospital Assistant and one Farash. 6. The average daily attendance at the Dispensary has been 42*25 per diem. A certain number of outside cases have also been attended to the pecuniary ad vantage of the Hospital Assistant, The large majority of cases treated are not of a serious nature and no opera tions, except of a minor character, have been performed. The eight wounded soldiers mentioned in last year's report were all progressing favourably when they were removed during the Vice-Consul's absence under orders from the Governor of Shushter. In one or two cases bullets have been extracted from wounded men. S outhern A rabistan, 7. Shaikh Khazal the Sardar Arfa', with the assistance of Haji Eais ut Tujjar has continued to exercise over the tribes of the province the dual authority of hereditary Chief and Persian Governor, At Nasiri, Shaikh Hanzal remained in charge of affairs until the end of June, when, under some arrangement with the Sardar Mukarram, he was deputed to Dizful with 300 or 400 sowars. Returning thence in August 1906 he was posted to Behbahan. His place at Nasiri has been supplied by his brother Haji Shaikh Rahman, a worthless creature devoid of either character or dignity, who spends the greater part of his time and energy in opium-smoking. Such an appointment proves the well known fact of the absolute dearth of men at Shaikh Khazal's command who have even such a minute acquaintance with the world and affairs as is neces sary in the incumbent at Nasiri. Shaikh Hanzal returned to Nasiri shortly before the end of March but did not resume charge there. 8. Shaikh Khazal's growing power and influence have suffered no known check during the year. On the other hand the sphere of his influence has been extended by the conferment on him of the Governorship of Behbahan including the Kuhgalu tribe (though this is hardly to be regarded as permanency: and in deed he withdrew his representative at the end of March) and by his having, it would appear, borne a share with the Sardar Mukarram in the expense of policing the country to the south and west of Dizful. In connection with the latter point he entered into direct communication with Khanjan Khan, whom he later deputed to maintain a body of sowars at Behbahan. A suggestion that he should establish himself with a force of sowars at Kut Nahr Hashim on the outskirts of the Hawiza district, was rejected by Khanj an. 9. The Shaikh's relations with the strong Governor of Shushter, the Sardar Mukarram, continue to grow at least outwardly in cordiality, and it is clear that they have agreed to regulate affairs affecting both in amity. More it would be unsafe to affirm. H awizaand the B eni T urup. 10. The outbreak which took place at Hawiza in March 1906 and was men tioned in last year's report was terminated by the flight of its instigator Haji Sabhan, of the Beni Turuf. No further trouble arose until November when the sons of Ali Minaishid and Zair Ali, who had been in charge of the Beni Turuf, began to make the usual difficulties about meeting the revenue demands. About this time Haji Sabhan reappeared on the scene. He was induced to come in to Shaikh Khaz'al at Failiya. Negotiations followed which resulted in his being appointed to the charge of the Beni Turuf. Being the man with the greatest influence in the tribe there is more hope of order being maintained when he is in office than when he is in the opposition. No recrudescence of trouble has yet taken place,26 administration report of the persian gulp and the fact tliat Major Morton has been permitted to pursue his investigatio on the Hawiza side of the Karun would seem to point to a considerable confiden in the stability of present conditions. 11. In the middle of November two political prisoners, Shaikhs of theCha h tribe, made their escape from Failiyah. The more important of these was Shaikh Sultan of the Mujaddam section. The occurrence was considered of some seriousness, and the Shaitkh himself seemed apprehensive that the fugitives would take refuge with the Bakhtiari Chiefs. Within a few days however they were recaptured in the Amara Marshes and handed back to the Shaikh. 12. In the latter part of February the long talked of marriage between Shaitkh Khazal's son, Shaikh Chasib, Nusret ul Mulk, and Haji Rais's daughter was con summated with great celebrations at Failiyah. The person chiefly to be congra tulated may be assumed to be Haji Rais. N orthern A rabistan. 13. The Governorship of this province has remained in the capable hands of the Sardar Mukarram, assisted by the Muizum Mamalik, commonly known as the ' Wazir.' The usual arrangement has been for the Sardar to superintend personally the affairs of Shushter, while entrusting Dizful to the Muizz. But the last three or four months of the year under review the Sardar spent chiefly in the neighbour- hood of Shush, and in southern Arabistan with the Shaitkh of Muhammerah, and local charge has been held by various of his subordinates, e.g., the Mir Punj, com manding the 'troops' at Shushter, and the Telegraph Sarhang at Dizful. During the earlier part of the period, Dizful was committed to the hands of Shahab i Lashkar, a petty Bakhtiari chief from the neighbourhood of Silakhor, who was on bad terms with the ruling chiefs of the Bakhtiaris. 14. The Sardar Mukarram's administration of Northern Arabistan has been, as things go in Persia, peculiarly successful. He is a clever, unscrupulous man, who suffers acutely from the especially Persian vice of money-hunger. This vice impels him to every form of oppression and extortion. 15. The comparatively high standard of security of life and property which has resulted was broken for a short time in December by robberies which occurred on the Shushter—Dizful Road. These were committed by Bakhtiaris and were probably instigated by the Khans, who are not on good terms with the Sardar Mukarram. There were also local disturbances at Gotwand in the Aqili district at various times during the year, consequent on the treatment accorded to one of the princi pal men of the place, named Haji Abul Fateh by the Bakhtiari Khans. There was some disagreement between the Khans and the Sardar over this case, and Abul Fath took refuge in Dizful. In the early months of 1907 however he returned to Gotwand. 16. The most interesting features in the Sardar Mukarram's administration have been connected with the Dizful district. Mention may be made of his suc cess in subjugating the semi-independent chiefs of the A1 Kathir Arabs. Haider, the paramount, chief was dispossessed and replaced by two men, Mizban and Khuraibat, the, latter his cousin, but this arrangement proving unsatisfactory he has again been admitted to a share of authority. His son Abbas and a son of Khuraibat—a mere boy—are kept in attendance on the Sardar by way of ' pledges.' The weakening of his enemies must be a subject of much satisfaction to Shaikh Farhan of the Bait S'ad, who has always rendered a qualified obedience to the Governor of Shushter, and is subservient to the Shaikh of Muhammerah, 17. More interesting is the pact entered into with Khanjan, Sagwand. With the aid of the recommendation of Shaikh Khazal he was introduced to the good graces of the Sardar Mukarram in April, since when he has been continuously sub sidised as a District Police Agent. This position, it is understood, has lately beenPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 27 formally recognised by the Central Government. For some months Khanjan's services with 30 or 40 of his sowars were secured by the Shaikh or Muhammerah for Shaikh Hanzal, when the latter was deputed to Behbahan. Later his place there was taken by his brother Hussain Khan. Khanjan complains that he is not paid as regularly as he might be, but con siders the position gained compensates for the lack of remuneration, so long as his means of livelihood do not entirely give out. 18. In July one of the servants of the French Scientific Mission was murdered inDizful during the absence of his masters in France. The case was subsequently dealt with by the Sardar Mukarram and it is believed that the supposed culprit was executed. 19. No representatives have been elected to represent this province (nor any of the other provinces dealt with in this report) in the Majlis i Shura i Milli. The only place where the matter has come up for debate, as far as reports go, is Dizful. After vainly aspiring after the services of the Muin ut Tujjar, another selection was put forward, but the only result arrived at was a split among the few chief people of the town who had constituted themselves the Electorate, one party bringing a charge of nepotism against the other. 20. Dizful. —Turning to the purely internal affairs of Dizful town. The religious authorities while keeping on friendly terms with the Governor, still occupy a predominant position in the regulation of Municipal affairs. The chief leader Shaikh Muhammad Hussain, Hujjat ul Islam, Mujtahid, and his son Shaikh Muhammad Baqir, have maintained unbroken cordial relations, and occasional friendly correspondence, with the Vice-Consul. A meeting took place in April 1906. 21. The long drawn out struggle between the representatives of the populace, and the authorities, over the question of the remission of the taxation on the Indigo works, was not brought to a final termination. On reference being made to it orders were issued by the Central Government that the remission might be made, but that it must be balanced by an increase under other heads oP^evenue. The town people are endeavouring to evade determining how this should be effected, a question left by the Sardar for them to settle. 22. Shushter, —The Sardar Mukarram's authority in Shushter was undis puted throughout the year. Shaikh Murtaza of the House of Shaikh Muhammad Ali who, under the pressure of the hostility of the Sardar and the rival house of Said Abdus Samad, had left for Ispahan and the north reached Tehran and took up residence in 'Bast' at the Legation. After enquiries from the Vice-Consul the Legation took an active interest in his affairs. The support of the authorities of the Central Government was obtained, but no practical effect was given by the Sardar Mukarram to orders directing him to restore their property and position to the Shaikh's family. Shaikh Murtaza eventually came down to Najaf and thence to Muhammerah where he met the Sardar and Shaikh Khazal. Promises were made and the good offices of the Shaikh brought into play, and it was arranged that Shaikh Murtaza was to return to Shushter in company with the Sardar. Matters stood at this point at the close of the period under consideration. Shaikh Murtaza called on the Vice-Consul at Nasiri and expressed gratitude for the services rendered him by the Legation, which are a matter of public know ledge. The Vice-Consul met Shaikh Murtaza's brother. Shaikh Jawad, at Shushter in May, but no regular relations have been maintained with him. He is a feeble ^ _ creature. oQ ^ Endeavours to arrive at an understanding with the family of Saiyad Abdus Samad regarding the payment and return of visits having failed, no further communi- glj cations have passed. There is nothing to be gained by regular intercourse with them as they will only serve our interests in view of some immediate advantage accruing to themselves.

T he B akhtiaris. 24. Internal Afjairs.—kt the beginning of the period with which this report deals the Ilkhaniship and Ilbegiship were held by the Sardar Asad and the Salar Arfa'. Owing to the friction which had occurred, the Samsam and the Shahah pro. ceeded to Tehran to endeavour to obtain redress of their grievances, whither they were followed by the Sardar Asad. The charge of the tribe was left in the hands of the Salar Arfa', with whom later was associated the M'uin Humayun representing the other faction and family It is stated that the Sardar Asad had previously made a show of obtaining tlie appointment of Ilkhani for the Samsam, but the latter would not accept it as com ing from the patronage of his junior and enemy. This had resulted in the Sar dar's appointment which thus was made to appear inevitable. Now by the lavish expenditure of money at Tehran the Sardar was discredited and the Samsam and the Shahab reinstated. This took place some time in May and June, and the three big chiefs returned to their country via Ispahan in the beginning of August. The net result of their bickering and jealousies had been a large pecuniary loss to the Khans. They estimate this, including property destroyed in their quarrels, at about 400,000 Tumans, and it is not improbable that half of this sum may have been thrown away. It is scarcely necessary to say that a deep-rooted bitterness exists between the rival parties. 25. The Sardar and the Salar did not come down to the plains, going instead to Tehran, whence eventually they proceeded on a trip to Europe—the Sardar to enjoy himself, and the Salar, somewhat unwillingly, to consult the doctors. The Sardar proposes visiting Egypt and Japan before his return which would not take place before two years. It is to be hoped that he will adhere to this pro gramme. In autumn the Sardar was stated to be 20,000 Tumans, and the Salar 80,000 Tumans, in debt, but their income is large. 26. Even now the remaining Khans do not present a united bodv. Of the Sardar's party there are Yusuf Khan at Tehran and the Sardar's sons- But the Samsam is abhorrent to the Shahab 5 s brothers, the Shujaus Sultan, Sarum um Mulk and Muin Humayun, the first of whom having been long in the present Shah's service, has established an interest at court for his own family which is likely to stand it in good stead. In the early part of 1907 these brothers were tending to combine with Yusuf Khan against the Samsam and indirectly against the Shahab who was loyal to his colleague. In March however during the discussion of outstanding questions with the Agent of the Shakh at Muhammerah a diversion of opinion arose between the latter which resulted in very strained relations and threw the Shahab again into the arms of his brothers. At the moment therefore the chief feature of the internal affairs of the Khans is the isolation of the Samsam which may end in his exclusion. 27. It is possible that deeper intrigues are in progress, and this is suggested by the report received in March that the Zargham us Sultana had been summoned to Tehran. This man is the son and the representative of Riza Kuli Khan, known as the 'Ilbegi,' the uncle of the present generation of Khans, who was in the eighties' a man of some importance. This family which has its headquarters at Paradumba in the Chahar Mahal used to give considerable trouble to the ruling chiefs, Riza Kuli Khan died in 1905. To strengthen or improve the relations between the families, the Muin Humayun last October married the sister of the Zargham us Sultana, a widow. The recent marriage of the Shaliab with a woman of the Chaharlang may per haps be similarly classed as a political alliance.political residency fob 1906-1907. 29 28 External Affairs.—The relations of the Bakhtiaris with the Shaikh of Muh—Xaswfs to he anticipated from the Ilkhamslup of the Samsam, have been bad. , . 11 In the spring of 1906 it had been arranged that the Shaikh and the Khans shoaM mine spring Oovernorship of Behbahan including the Kuhgalu tribe) ' v^T ^r iS^due course the Shaikh obtained the Govern- H. ~ W fore obliged to assume the whole responsibihty himself. , , ^ , The Shaikh who was visited a month later, made out a much better case for himseH ^nd laid numerous, probably not unfounded, charges of bad faith against the Khans, -n Trma+prmfy ol their forces by the Khans were rife in January, and Rumours of mustenng of their toe s j to the ghaikh The latt at the sa ®?J? • g UCCess ^ playing off certain Bakhtian-Kuhgalu secret affi- nitii and nrWe to make goodVeir bluff, the Khan, had to profess entire satis- faction with the Shaikh's answer. . , j .1 20 Rumours of pending raids b y the Bakhtiaris which were to include the whole of the northern part of the Shaikh 's territory were for some time current.

Ia * 31. {a) British Affairs. —The discussion of British interests with the Kh has occupied a large place in the work of the Vice-Consulate during the year ^ It should be noted that in October, after some discussion, the decision eventually arrived at in consultation between the Government of India and t^ S Legation at Tehran that it was advisable that the charge of negotiations betwp ^ the Concessions (Oil) Syndicate and the Bakhtiari Khans should be placed in th 11 hands of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Arabistan, who should corres 6 pond through the Consul General in whose district he might at the time be (v' Bushire or Ispahan), copies of his despatches being sent to the other. *' This decision was in due course approved by His Majesty's Secretary fo Foreign Affairs. ' ' r Circumstances also led to the discussion of all matters relating to the Ahwaz Ispahan Road being conducted through the same medium. 32. The Oil Syndicate, —First in importance are to be placed the affairs of tie Concessions (Oil) Syndicate Limited. It will be remembered that at the end of the period kst reported on, we had had reason to take objection to the failure to make adequate guarding arrangements and to pay up compensation for thefts etc Neither of these objections had been removed, when the Vice-Consul met ^ Salar Arfa' at Chighakhor in July. In the meantime the Sardar Asad, and the others at Tehran, had initiated a campaign for extracting more money. In this the Sardar was in league with the Foreign Minister, the Mushir ud Daulah, who in a personal interview suggested several of the main objections raised against the existing Agreement. Reference was made to the Syndicate by the Legation and in due course their reply was received and submitted to the Khans who had now returned to their homes. None of the essential demands of the Khans were allowed, and in any case it was declared unnecessary to cancel and redraft the agreement as required by them 33. In the latter half of October the Vice-Consul met the Samsam, Shahab and Sarum um Mulk at Gishnagun, and again the Sardar Asad and the Salar Arfa' at Junaghun. Matters were talked over in great detail, and the Khans' demands were finally reduced to that for an extra annual payment of £500, in return for which a respon sible chief was to be placed in the immediate charge of the Guards and Oil affairs. A more precise definition was also required of the exact nature of losses etc for which compensation would have to be paid. Guards which had been refused for the second place at which the Syndicate wished to work, were also after some hesitation supplied. Subsequent enquiry and examination on the spot however revealed that the provision of guards in practice was at both places a mere farce, and this was further accentuated by a series of thefts, etc. n the Khans then at Malamir met with little result beyond urgent demands for the settlement of the payment of the additional £500 ; while the Khans m the north lodged a demand for payment of all their dues in gold coin. ^ rc J} ^ice-Consul met the Khans at Ramuz.

This has had considerable effect, and for the time being the situation is better than it has been yet. 35. Trouble is always to be anticipated from the Samsam, over whose men tal vagaries it is impossible to establish any effective hold, but for the moment he has fallen into line in supplying guards in spite of his very tall and violent talk at Ramuz, where he swore steadily for nearly three weeks that if we pressed our de mands and did not give in to his, he would refuse further responsibility and formally throw up all connection with the affairs of the Syndicate. To anticipate what properly should appear in next year's report, the Samsam has since plucked up heart again and returned by letter to the question of the addi tional £500 and payment in gold; but this was only to be expected. 36. The Ahwaz-Ispahan Road. —Messrs. Lynch Brothers' interests as effect ed by the Ahwaz-Ispahan Road have also during the year been a subject of official discussion and correspondence with the Khans. In spring on pressure exerted by the Legation to induce the Khans to improve the state of upkeep of the road the latter gave promises to have it thoroughly overhauled. Little or nothing however had been done when the Vice-Consul travelled up the road in June. At Chighakhor the Salar Arfa' represented that he was then in the beginning of July despatching men to repair the road, and that orders were being issued to remove the restriction by which muleteers are com pelled to buy supplies only from the farmers of the caravansarais. Subsequently from references made by the Legation it was ascertained that the Khans at Tehran were asserting that the road had been thoroughly overhauled and that they accept ed that it should be inspected and reported on in regard to the state of the track, caravansarais and bridges, and that defects reported by the Vice-Consul would be removed. The Vice-Consul addressed the Samsam on the subject at Shalamzar in the middle of October, a reply in writing was obtained that the road had been put in thorough repair, but that it was possible that it had again been damaged by the downward passage of the tribes and that defects pointed out would be remedied. The Vice-Consul then travelled down the road and subsequently had to report that the evidences of work done on it were very slight, and that no action had been taken as regards the caravansarais, which were all in a dilapidated condition and insufficient in number. A detailed report of work considered necessary was drawn up and despatched to the Khans. It is said that the report was subsequently divided up into sections and handed over for action to various men of authority in the different localities concerned. Further inspection and report will be made in the course of a month or two. Both in the Oil affairs and in those of the road the Khans have openly reveal ed their guiding policy which is merely to extract the maximum of money possible and expend the minimum, or if possible, none. This receives corroboration out of the mouths of their own people and all who know them. 37. The question of supplying the Khans with a British Medical Practitioner, which has been considered on various occasions during the past few years, was definitely discussed at Chighakhor with the Salar Arfa' by Captain Crossle, I.M.S. The upshot was that the Khans declared that the heavy expenses incurred during the year made it impossible for them to discuss the project with any view of putting it immediately into effect. It is believed that Captain Crossle has re ported on the aspects of the case as ;.-egards the eligibility of the billet from the point of view of a British Medical Practitioner. It is doubtful whether any such arrangements if carried out would not be more productive of trouble and misundes- Btanding than of contentment and of gratitude on the part of the Khans. THE KUHGALU. 38. The Kuhgalu. —This tribe, inhabiting for the most part the hills beyond the eastern border of the Bakhtiaris, are nominally subject to the ^governing authority of Behbahan, who in turn is subordinate to the Government of Fars.32 administration report of the persian gulp The ancient enmity existing between them and the Bakhtiaris is yearly accen. tuated by the raids and robberies which they commit m Bakhtian territory, and more especially on the Ahwaz-Ispahan Road. The Bakhtiari Khans continually profess to be anxious to follow up the Ruhealu to their own country and inflict punishment on them. The Persian Gov ernment however persists in refusing permission and the Khans are thereby furnished with a ready-made excuse for whatever insecurity makes its appearance in their country. It has been seen elsewhere that they have held back from availing them, selves of the radical remedy which was put within their reach, that of themselves taking over the Government of the Behbahan and Kuhgalu district. It is probable that while they are unwilling to part with a perennial complaint wherewith to counter charges of bad administration against themselves, they are also not entirely prepared in spite of their boasting to measure themselves force to force against the Kuhgalu, who are numerous and well-armed, and inhabit a very difficult country. Further suspicion is cast on the sincerity of the Khans by the well known fact that the Samsamhas a private understanding with the second most import- ant chief of the tribe, Ali Naqi (of the Taibi), while the Shahab is on similar terms with the most notable of all—Karim Khan (of the Bair Ahmadi). 39. In July the Kuhgalu made a raid in force on Deh Diz, at that season near ly emptied of its inhabitants, and carried off a caravan of some thirty mules which were carrying loads for Messrs. Lynch Brothers. The local authorities at Deh Diz, who have marriage ties with the Kuhgalu, presumed to visit the robbers in their homes thinking to negotiate the restoration of the property. They were instead taken prisoners and mulcted of money and rifles. The Bakhtiari Khans have since paid up compensation to Messrs. Lynch Brothers. 40. Very little is known about the internal affairs of the Kuhgalu, but they are much split up into mutually hostile factions. The tribesmen are in a pronounced degree of the savage and law-defying char acter which is the distinguishing feature of all Lur communities, but Karim Khan is said to be a superior man and it is asserted that it would be quite possible to visit the country under his auspices, but sufficient reason or opportunity for doirg bo has not yet presented itself. Until study is made on the spot, knowledge of tlie Kuhgalu will remain unsatisfactory. 41. Appended to this report will be found a table showing the sections of tne Kuhgalu according to the best information at present available. Geographical references cannot in most cases be located. LURISTAN. 42. Internal. —The Governorship of Luristan was taken from the Farman Farma and conferred on the Salar ud Daulah early in 1906. The Dirakwand Chiefs who were in confinement in Kermanshah on account of the Luristan outrage were taken over by the Salar ud Daulah and removed to Khurramabad. The Sagwand Chief Mihr Ali Khan, who was also in confinement, was poisoned by his orders at Burujird. In autumn the Dirakwand Chiefs addressed themselves to Khanjan asking for his friendly offices, but were repulsed. This is on Khanjan's authority. 43. Late in the autumn the Wali of Pusht i Kuh joined the Salar with an arm ed force. They kept the field east of Khurrambad for some time, and engage ments took place with the strong recalcitrant tribe of the Bairanwand. As reports go there were casualties on both sides without any decisive results being obtained. An idea of coercing the Dirakwand was entertained and minatory messages were sent them, but action did not follow. Eventually the Wali, tired of the exhibition of his inefficiency, returned to his own country in the beginning of 1907 having sustained a loss of 20 or 30 men-political residency for 1906-1907. 44. Thereafter the Salar projected coming down with the Sagwand of Fazil Khan and Hassan Gridaw, as an escort, to Saimara and Ja'idar, and in February there were circumstantial reports of his presence at Qilab and of his immediate intention of raiding Arabistan. The official authorities however now describe these reports as 'canards.' The Salar is said to have recently taken to wife a daughter of the Fath i Sul tan, of the Dilfan who was formerly his arch-enemy. The latest rumours, which probably carry back to the events of March, make out that he has gone to Tarhon, the Fath i Sultan's head-quarters, and that in view of the enmity of the authori ties is contemplating a retreat into Turkish Arabia. 45. The limit of the period under review may be overstepped by a few days •to say that on the 18th April 1907 the Sardar Mukarram received a telegram in vesting him with the Governorship of Luristan. The matter had for some time been under discussion, but the Government had refused to agree to the terms which the Sardar was demanding—a sufficiency of troops, and financial assistance. 46. The Sagwand. —Fazil Khan and Hassan Gidaw on the return to power of their old patron the Salar ud Daulah quitted Arabistan to attach themselves to him. Early in 1907 however they found their hopes disappointed, and Hassan Gidaw declared his intention of deserting the Salar and coming down to Arabistan, which he did. The time was not ill-judged for turning his coat. He is now dancing attend ance on the Sardar Mukarram. Khanjan's fortunes have been already described. He played a bold game in finally coming in to the Sardar at Shushter in May and accepting employment from him, but the results on the whole have been satisfactory and the alternative of remaining liable to the stigma of being a rebel, would have had serious conse quences. Khanjan Khan's visit to the Sardar Arfa' atthesametime was well judged, as it gave the corroboration of personal acquaintance to a merely favourable inclina tion on the part of the Sardar. The visit was repeated again in January. He remains unaltered in his desire to obtain employment in our service. 47. No noticeable displacement of power amonc: the tribes of Luristan appears to have taken place during the year; unless it be the absorption of the section of Sagwand which formerly followed the leadership of Mihr Ali Khan. 48. External. —Correspondence has been kept up during the year with the Khurramabad Merchant Mirza Ali Akbar. He has been employed as Agent by Messrs. Lynch Brothers who have sent him, from time to time, goods via Ispahan for sale on commission. He has on several occasions complained of tampering with letters on the part of the Persian Post Office and reference was made by this Vice-Consulate to the Legation at the instance of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Lately since the return of the Salar ud Daulah, he has fallen on evil times and has gone to Tehran where Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and eventually the Legation, have moved in his favour. ♦ 49. No progress has been made with the question of the Dizful-Khurramabad Road, and the idea of instituting a temporary caravan route via Pusht i Kuh and Saimara, having been regarded with disfavour by His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment, has been abandoned. Commercial commimication between the provinces of Iraq and Arabistan has remained entirely intercepted. 50. The awakening of interest on the part of Russians in this part of the coun try has been notified by the appointment of a native Agent at Khurramabad. Mirza Abdul Ali, Kermanshahi, the Agent appointed, came from Kermanshah, and tlhe post is probably supervised by the Russian Consul at the latter place. In the middle of December a Russian visited Burujird. Various conjectures v^ere current as to the objects of his visit, the most probable being that he had come to examine the local conditions in connection with a possible extension of the Kazvin-Hamadan Road to Burujird. 3147 r. D. *34 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Should the Russians establish a strong influence in Luristan it would to a large extent render nugatory, for purposes of mutual defence, our gms&amp;-alliance with the Bakhtiari Khans, as it would at once place at the disposal of the invaders a route for moving their troops southwards—a route which would be infinitely easier than any that could be found through the Bakhtiari country. PUSHT-I-KUK. 51. Internal. —The Wali Ghulam Riza Khan continues in undisputed pos session of his ancestral lands. The disputes with his sons, which during the past two or three years had on more than one occasion culminated in active hostilities were composed in the spring of 1906, and to judge by the negative evidence afford ed by the absence of reports it may be assumed that no serious misunderstand ings have since arisen. The excursions of the Wali into Luristan and its affairs at the request of his son-in-law, the Salar ud Daulah, have been mentioned above under the heading of Luristan. They can have added nothing to his prestige and appear to justify Khanjan's prophetic assertions that the Wali could not successfully tackle the problems of that province. 52. Occasional correspondence have taken place between the Vice-Consul and the Wali. Kaid Khani, the Wali's Agent, was despatched in April to visit the Vice-Consul at Nasiri but was recalled while on the way. Later in April, at Dizful the Vice-Consul met the Kaid Khani who conveyed very friendly messages from his master. Some conversation took place with re gard to the Saimara route and every hope was held out of the readiness of the Wali to accommodate himself to our wishes. As explained above however this question is now in abeyance. A present was sent to the Wali for his son (the choice of which son being left to the Wali who ha^ strong predilections for his third son). It was warmly acknowledged. It was proposed to visit the Wali in the cold weather and correspondence took place, but his absence in Luristan prevented the accomplishment of this project. The Kaid Khani, by request, arranged for the passage through Pusht i Kuh to Kermanshah of Major Baird travelling for the Intelligence Branch of the Indian Army. The journey was made in December and January, and Kaid Khani accom panied Major Baird in person from Deh Luran to Kermanshah and gave every satisfaction by his attentiveness and obligingness. The first part of the journey was made under the auspices of Khanjan Khan, Sagwand, and Shaikh Mushattat of the Surkha, with both of whom excellent relations exist. In March Kaid Khani came down to Nasiri with letters from the Wali, but unfortunately the Vice-Consul was absent at Ramuz at that time. • 53. In the absence of more serious business the mention of all these trifling details is made to show the point which relations between this Vice-Consulate and the Wali have reached. There would be no dfficulty in taking up business or nego tiations at any time that occasion arose, and there is every reason to look for an obliging attitude on the part of the Wali, A personal and cordial acquaintance has been obtained with his principal Agents. The Wali made somewhat serious demands on His Britannic Majesty 's Con sul at Ktrmanshah, but there is little reason to believe that he would insist on the acceptance of these as a preliminary to business relations, or that he would not gladly receive as a substitute a less embarrassing form of friendship. FOREIGN INTERESTS. 54. With the exception of Luristan already referred to above, this heading has no application outside Arabistan. The Russians. —There has been no evidence of activity on the part of the Russians during the year in Arabistan. They continued to be represented by the Dutchman ter Meulen till the end of October, when they dispensed with his ser vices on the grounds that he had taken up the agency of the iiew German- Hamburg America Line of Steamers. Mr. ter Meulen protested loudly and appealed to Tehran. Having in the meantime been turned off by the German Company,political residency for 1906-1907. S5 he was finally reinstated in February with retrospective effect from the 1st of November. 55. The Germans. —In connection with the establishment of the Hamburg- America Line in the Gulf, Mr. ter Meulen was appointed their Agent at Ahwaz by the Company. Having fallen out however with the Agent at Basra, Wonckhaus, the agency was taken from him and given to Haji Eais (or his son, the Mushir ud Tujjar). 56. Foreign Visitors. —There have been no foreign visitors of interest. In deed beyond the Frenchmen of the Mission Scientifique, who this year did not include M. de Morgan, only one visitor, a young Frenchman, M. Bquchon, fresh from the Ecole Polytechnique, made his appearance. He is the son of a big French Sugar Manufacturer. He only stayed one night. FOREIGN AND PERSIAN BUSINESS CONCERNS. 57. Mr. ter Meulen. —Mr. Gratama, the young Dutchman who spent the cold weather of 1905-06 with ter Meulen, has since been engaged in endeavouring to ob tain capital in Holland for a Company. In the beginning of 1907 Mr. ter Meulen announced that he had been success ful and that he would be starting to join him in February. Subsequently however a delay intervened owing to Mr. Gratama's going to Manchester to approach cer tain firms there. He is now expected in Ahwaz early in May. He is a level-head ed gentlemanly man, and may have some moderating influence on Mr. ter Meulen's eccentricities. As these on occasion amount to madness, it is unlikely that the partnership will survive long unless Mr. Gratama's counsels in the business become paramount. Mr. ter Meulen has lately obtained permission to have a private warehouse under the charge of the Customs. The terms as regards rent and fees for opening it, etc., are severe, and it is difficulj} to see that he will benefit by it. He has also obtained a site for a private wharf, but what purposes, this will serve are enigmatical. The S. S. Malamir any rate will not visit it. His young unpaid assistant, Mr. VanBuuren, is still here, but is on the worst possible terms with him, and will probably leave on Mr. Gratama's arrival, if not earlier. RAZUKI. Razuki, an Armenian Agent of Messrs. Asfar and Company of Basra, came to Ahwaz in the beginning of the summer of 1906. He was entrusted with £20,000 capital which he has thrown about in the most reckless way. His operations at once sent up the rates of labour and rents, already too high, and he entirely ruined the wheat trade which in view of an excellent harvest should have been very profit able. He was very rash in granting advances, much of which he has not recovered. He refused to come to any agreement with other buyers as to price, so Messrs. Lynch Brothers eventually raised the rates still further by way of retaliation, which they were able to do as they were little involved. Razuki also lost immense quantities of wheat by failing to make provision for protecting it from rain. He has however feathered his own nest and drives about in state on the desert in a carriage—the summit of local ambition attained only by one other individual. 59. The Muin ut Tujjar. —The principal of the Muin's schemes projected in the beginning of 1906 which has borne fruit is that of placing a steamer on the lower Karun. This made its appearance in July. It did well at first, but is not now very popular. The Agent at Ahwaz is a respectable Persian, Muhammad Baqir, who used to be registered at Bushire as a British subject. The working of the ship is at times interfered with by the Shaikh, who considers that he has a prescriptive right to requisition it for his own use when he feels so disposed. The ship is not properly looked after and being unprovided with conden sers the boiler ought soon to become clogged up by the deposit of the mud of which the river water is full. 60. The Muin also early in 1907 completed a large store room at Shalailiyah, the port of Shushter on the Gargar. 3147 F. D. p 236 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Messrs. Lynch had for many years been trying to obtain permission to erect such a store room. They had brought tentative negotiations with the owners of suitable land to a conclusion, and the site of the present building of wliicli they claim the proprietorship having been forcibly occupied by the Muin, the own ers are contemplating steps to recover possession, in which case they would make arrangements to hand it over to Messrs. Lynch Brothers. As they belong to the religious house of Shaikh Muhd Ali, their success will depend on the course of events in Shushter and whether the family is successful in regaining its lost position. 61. The Nasiri-Ahwaz Tramway.—in December improved rolling stock was added to that already on hand. Six trolleys are at present working. The con- cern pays well, but it is difficult to figure out that it made a net profit of 1,200 Tumans in ten months, as asserted by the Agent, Muhammad Baqir. Lynch Brothers concluded an agreement with the Muin ut Tujjar, bywhicli in consideration of receiving 4 in place of 3 Krans per ton carried, he has to lay down a branch line running into Lynch's wharf. This would save the Company the expense of keeping up a cart. There are however no signs of the agreement being put into practical effect. BRITISH INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES. 62. The Karun Irrigation Scheme, —Major Morton remained throughout tlie year in Arabistan. During the hot weather when field work is impossible he took up his quarters in the Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz. After some unreadiness and delay on the Shaikh's part arrangements were made for Major Morton to extend his investigations to the right bank of the Karun from Ahwaz downwards. This he accomplished at the end of the period under review. His field work is now almost completed, and it is concluded that he will shortly be recalled to India. The Shaikh and the inhabitants in general (little understanding such matters) are unable to conceive that an Irrigation survey should occupy so long, and the Shaikh has pressed for information to be given him as to the general conclusions arrived at by Major Morton. It is believed that reference has been made by His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Muhammerah. The tribes are inclined to view this survey as a preliminary to military inva sion, and but for the Shaikh's strong control would no doubt not tolerate it. 63. Major Baird, D.S.O. —Major Baird, deputed by the Indian Intelligence Branch to make certain investigations in Arabistan, Pusht i Kuh, Luristan, Kermanshah, Hamadan and Turkish Arabia, reached Ahwaz in the end of Nov^ ember. It had been proposed that he should proceed via Baghdad and return by Ahwaz, but to forestall the coldweather in the high country this was reversed. Arrangements were made from Ahwaz by which he travelled up through Pusht i Kuh to Kermanshah which place he reached in safety. (COMMERCIAL.) ^ essrs ' Lynch Brothers. —The year has not been an entirely eventful one for this Company or those affiliated to it, viz., the Tigris and Euphratis Steam Navigation Company and the Persian Transport Company. A slight advance was made towards remedying their most serious deficiency—the lack of an adequate European Staff—by appointment of a European, Mr. Eedfern, to the Muhammerah Agency. He is however being transferred to Ahwaz to replace Mr. Wilson who goes home on leave. 65. A native Agency was started at Deh Kurd in the Chaharmahal in the beginning o± 1907, which has been entrusted to an Armenian, who till last year represented the firm at Shushter. f +^ e J 1 a § rea ^ ceri tre for mules and is incidentally a distributing depot lor trade having connections with a very large part of Persia. In this way there are routes frequented by caravans from Deh Kurd to Shushter, Shiraz, Urujan, spa an. e ran, Khonsar, Hamadan, etc. It is hoped by establishing an agency here that a useful source of transport may be tapped, and also that some of thePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 37 local Chaharmalial trade at least may be secured, which is at present in part run at a great profit by the Deh Kurd muleteers, and is in part in the hands of Ispahan dealers. 66. The relations of the firm with the Bakhtiari Khans have not been further complicated by direct communication with them. The question of the upkeep of the road was discussed with the Khans only by the Legation and the Vice-Consul. Claims for loss of merchandise by robbery on the road were settled as in the past without difficulty on direct reference by Messrs. 'Lynch Brothers. 67. The interests of the Tigris and Euphratis Steam Navigation Company were attacked by the Muin ut Tujjar placing a rival steamer on the Lower Karun. This steamer has been plying since. In the early stages and probably owing to the underhand influence of Haji Eais it took away much cargo from the ' Malamir.' But this state of affairs has not lasted and its competition is scarcely felt. The Company has after some hesitation renewed their private agreement with Haji Eais which was expiring, by which in return for an annual payment of 400 Tumans he binds himself to protect the interests of the firm on the river. 68. The Concession Oil Syndicate, Limited. —By the month of May the Eamuz river had fallen sufficiently to admit of the material which had been accumulated on the right bank being taken over to the boring site on the left bank at Mamatain and Shardin. In the course of the summer months the workshops and drilling plant were erected, and drilling commenced. At the end of March this drill hole had attained the depth of 600 feet, but no oil had so far been obtained. Drilling was also start ed in the end of the calendar year at Shardin, and by the end of March a depth of 400 feet had been reached, but also without success in the obtaining of the oil. Work preliminary to boring at another place, Musjid-i-Sulaiman (or Maidan- i-Munuftun) has also been in progress since October. A cart road is being made through the series of hills behind which the place lies. Most of the plant has in anticipation been shipped up the Gargar and some of it has been carted out to the foot of the hills. Great difficulty has been experienced in their work by the Syndicate owing to the robberies and insecurity due to the failure of the Bakhtiari Khans to keep to their agreements, and to their studied indifference to the interests of the Company. The resulting negotiations with the Khans have been mentioned in another place. Considering the difficulties and the nature of the country an amazing amount of work has been done in the past year. 69. Indian trade was represented for a few months in Ahwaz by a man Fazil, a Bombay trader, who with his brother has a business in Muhammerah. He returned to Muhammerah in December. 70. In February a Mr. Sievewright Catto, travelling on behalf of the firm of McAndrew, Forbes, came to Arabistan to inspect the liquorice grounds of the Diz river. With the aid of introductions to the Chiefs of the Anafija Arabs Shaikh Alwan and Fellah, he was enabled to see all he required in a few days. He did not appear to regard this liquorice supply of importance except as pro viding an additional source on emergency.38 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF A—Table of the sections of the Kuhgalu Tribe. — — — Name.

General. —The chief event of the year has been the establishment or, to be more correct, the attempted establishment, of the Provincial Assembly at Kermanshah. The natural formation of parties which followed the commencement of the elections proved a convenient peg upon which to hang the enmity which had previously existed between certain sections of the local community. This is a subject with which I will deal later as it did not occur till the latter part of the year. Amir Afkham, formerly known as Hissam-ul-mulk, a title now held by his younger son, was appointed Governor of Kermanshah. Zahir-ed-douleh was Governor of Hamadan, Salar-ed-douleh, younger brother of the Shah, Governor of Luristan, Wazir-i-Humayoon, Governor of Kurdistan, and Prince Haji Saif-ud- douleh, Governor of Malayer. In the early part of the year Amir Afkham sent to Salar-ed-douleh two moun tain guns, presumably for use against the Lurs. These later formed part of the latter's artillery in his attack on the town of Nehawend during his rebellion against the Shah. As early as June rumours began to circulate that the Shah was dead; in fact he died so often that the volatile Persian was too bored with his procrastination to create the disturbances which are customary on the decease of a sovereign in this country. The district was, however, continually disturbed, and robberies were frequent. In July thieves broke into the Consulate and stole tomans 20 and a certain amount of clothing; they escaped and as usual, their identity was never discovered. It would need a Persian optimist to hope to catch a thief unless actually discovered in flagrante delicto or with the proceeds of his theft on his person. There is no police and all misdemeanours are referred to the Kadkhuda of the Mohalla ; it stands to reason, then that if the robber is a ruffian from another part of the town, he is neither questioned or suspected, and the wonder is that more robberies are not committed. I suppose the Persian is too lazy to form a regular habit of any kind. In the same month disturbances took place in Kermanshah between sections of the people, swords were used and some four or five were wounded. The Governor took unexpectedly strong measures, and two influential men were sent in chains to Hamadan. Moin-ur-raya, a leader of one of the factions, took sanctuary in the Turkish Consulate General, from whence he was expelled and was arrested by the authorities. He was released the following week and presented with a ' khillat.' Moin-ur-raya is a rich man. Three men had their ears cut off and this ended the disturbance for the time being. The news of the dismissal of the Sadr Azam, Ain-ed-douleh, was received in Kermanshah on the 30th July and great rejoicings took place, the town being illuminated. On the 14th August the news was received of the return of the Mullahs from Kum to Tehran and once more great rejoicings took place. Though, no doubt, on this occasion real, great rejoicings are somewhat mis leading in Persia. As often as not they are indulged in by order, and as a general rule, the Persian is not loath to seize upon an occasion for a general holiday; to the mere outsider it frequently appears a subject of wonder that business can cease in the manner it does without dislocating its connections. Everything however seems to resume its ordinary course and every one appears content. At the beginning of August there was considerable fighting amongst the tribes of the district of Asadabad. The leaders of the disturbance were seized by Ihtasham-ul-Mamalik, the elder son of Amir Afkham, in the time honoured Persian40 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP way of pretending friendship and then seizing the required guests and keeping them prisoners. I observe that Captain Gough states that the Farman Farma refers to this system as la haute politique. In December the elections started in Kermanshah. At first all went well under the virile control of the Imam-i-Jnma. A party of the clergy stood aloof saying that once there was an assembly to which disputes and questions could be referred the Urf or Civil law would begin to oust the Shara or Religious law. Of the truth of their contention I think no doubt can exist. The Imam-i-Juma was, however very strongly in favour of the new ideas and being by far the most important and influential Mujtahid in the town he controlled affairs and the election meetings commenced. Had he lived the disturbances which afterwards took place might have been avoided. But he died shortly after, and immediately on his death the two parties sprang up. About this time it also became certain that the Shah could not live much longer, and cartridges and tents, etc., were sent down from Tehran so as to be ready in case any disturbances should take place. It was given out that the Governor was proceeding to the frontier with troops, but I do not think many people had much doubt as to the real reason for the preparations. On the 10th of January I was officially informed of the death of the Shah which had taken place on the 8th and of the accession of the new Shah Mohammed Ali Mirza. No disturbance of any kind took place and no one seemed particularly interested. In February election affairs came to a head. The two parties which formed were the same in origin as the two which had fought in the earlier part of the year. These parties were now considerably re-inforced on both sides. The one to which I have always referred as the aristocratic party and which consisted of the local landowners and nearly all the Mullahs with the followers of both, were in realitv opposed to any change in the constitution and especially were against the selection of members for the local assembly which the people were making. The other part was composed of the common people, notably the trades-people and one or two Mullahs whom the people followed. The leader of this party was a Mujtahid Agha Mahomed Mehdi by name. This division of parties is the natural sequence 0 of events, as natural as was the division of England into Cavaliers and Roundheads. Until the proclamation of the constitution the power in the country lay ab solutely in the hands of the official classes and the Mullahs ; the former had in their hands all physical, the latter all moral power. The new system strikes at the former power directly, at the latter indirectly, but at both with equal force. The class from which Governors are recruited is, even if not openly so, naturally in sympathy with the aristocratic party. To this rule the exceptions are rare. At the same time the people goaded beyond the limit of patience by the tyranny of the officials and the corruption of the Mullahs were ready to seize with avidity the opportunity of freedom provided for them by their compatriots at Tehran. There is no doubt also a considerable feeling amongst the upper class of traders that they would like to pay back in part some of the tyranny and extortion to which they have been subject. This, then, being the situation it is not difficult to understand what has lollowed. P eo ple had elected the members whom they desired to represent them. This election apparently required the official sanction. The Governor, however, a led and procrastinated and the aristocratic party protested that the elections were irregular and did not represent that elusive qualitv, the will of the people. The question was referred to Tehran, but no definite answer came. At last on the MtA ox March the peopk tired of waiting closed the bazaars and went into bast m the town square. The aristocratic party collected in the house of a Mujtahid, Rais-ul-ulema. p • an order cam e from Tehran, that Muin-ur-raya and Kais-ut-tu]ar with Shaikh Mohammad Hassan, leading members of the aristocratic party (though hardly aristocrats) should be seized and turned out of the town, i ♦le men proclaimed obtained previous news of this order and disappeared from ken.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 41 On the day following a member of the people's party was passing the house of the Rais-ul-ulema and was received with hoots and it is said stones. He rushed into the square shouting that the others had been trying to kill him. The people m the maidan turned out in some force and rushed for the Rais-ul-ulema s house where they were met with volleys from the guns of the inmates. I am of opinion that the nien above-named who were ' wanted ' were in the house and the residents thereof thought that the people were coming with the intention of seizing them. In the riot that ensued four of the people's party were killed and a few wounded. The Governor was dismissed for his want of control, and so ended the Persian year. Political.—In October the Russian Consul appointed Agents at Kasr-i-shirm and at Khurramabad in Luristan. These are appointments, I fancy, more m the nature of news agencies than anything else. Shortly after a trader, the Wakil-ut-tujar, of Senna, was appointed Russian Agent at that place. After the downfall of Ismail Bakir in the bank, of which mention will be found, the acting Russian Consul approached him with an offer to supply him with Russian piecegoods for his stores on two years credit. Bakir did not accept the offer as he desires to import English goods where it is possible. Customs. —M. Wafielaert, the Director General of Customs, received the Russian Order of St. Anne of the 2nd Class. He stated that this was for the assistance which he gave to Prince Anatouni at Bushire. At the beginning of 1907, M. Waffelaert seized certain goods belonging to a British subject, a Jew, Shawal Levi by name. These goods were on their way to Pusht-i-kuh in Persian territory ; since there is no custom station beyond Kerman- shah in that direction M. Waffelaert maintained that these goods were being smuggled across the frontier. I pointed out that, though it was true that certain goods, viz., a jewelled sword, half a pound of shot and the food of the muleteers^ had not been declared to the customs, it was absurd to say that it was intended to smuggle such a ridiculously small quantity of goods across the frontier which lay a considerable distance beyond Pusht-i-kuh. The food belonging to the muleteers should have been declared according to rule, but this rule has been honoured in the breach. M. Waffelaert, however, persisted in seizing two mules which he agreed to release on payment of Tomans 100. The punishment was out of all proportion to the technical offence, and so the case was referred to the Central Administration at Tehran, whence after enquiry Shawal Levi was ordered to pay a fine of 10 Tomans. Throughout the case I maintained and still maintain that the Reglement Legal could not be made to apply since that code applies to import and export onlv, and cannot be made to refer to carriage in the interior of Persia. This point is still under reference. M. Waffelaert was most pig-headed, I might say discourteous, throughout the case ; he refused to release the mules which' he had seized even on my personal security that I would be lesponsible for the recovery of any fine inflicted by the administration at Tehran. He was however ordered to release the mules directly the case was referred to Tehran. There was little doubt he was swayed by Baron Staudach, a Persian subject of Austrian origin, a member of the Customs Department and a Mussulman, who had a grudge against both the owner of the mules and their lessee. Posts. —At the beginning of the year the Governor asked that the posts should be taken out of the hands of the Customs Department and placed in the hands of the Persian as the pensions were paid very irregularly. Captain Gough notes that the postal department could not be worse organised than it was at the time and a change could not be for the worse. I may note that this change has since been effected. In December last M. Waffelaert under orders from his administration demand ed double tax on all letters bearing Service stamps. As I had received no notice and was unaware of the legality of the demand I did not take delivery of such letters and referred the case to the Legation. It was finally ordered that letters bearing such stamps should be delivered free pending the Government of India^ being warned that the use of such stamps should be discontinued for Persia. 3147 F. D. Q 242 administration report of the persian gulf Imperial Bank of Persia.—The day after I arrived at Kermansliali in October I was informed that the book-keeper of the Imperial Bank of Persia intended to abscond that night. I sent for the Manager of the Bank, Mr. Milligan, who was satisfied with the evidence' and accordingly got the man, by name Mirza Ismail Khan Bakir, arrested and as he was a Persian subject, handed him over to the Persian authorities. His arrest caused a great sensation in Kermanshah for he was one of the most influential men in the place and the owner of the English stores. Until the age of 15 vears he was educated in England and afterwards in the American school at Bevrout The cause of Bakir's downfall was being overtrusted, with the result that he was not sufficiently supervised. His signature had been sufficient for receipts and he had introduced most of the applicants for loans. The result was that he had issued various loans to himself in the names of other people and also had intercepted various payments into the bank. It is expected that in time he will be able to make good his defalcations, but his regime (for he was practically Manager at any rate during the incumbency of the previous Manager of the bank) has been most disastrous ; loans issued during his time have in very many cases quite insufficient security. Since I have been in Kermanshah I have spent a very considerable time over bank cases Owing to the disturbed state of the country combined with the change of Governors, it has been difficult to bring continued pressure with any usefu] result. The Manager of the bank and his Accountant unfortunately quarrelled. An Inspector, Mr. Messervy, was sent down in November to enquire into matters and to put things on a proper footing, and has had a difficult time. Notwithstanding that during part of the year the country was upset, trade improved considerably. The Customs returns show an increase of £268,662 in imports and an increase of £129 571 in exports In the former the United Kingdom is responsible for an increase of £217 ,896 and India for an increase of £11,407. The returns for Kerman- shah require to be read in conjunction with those for Kesht to understand the fluctuations. It has previously been explained by Consuls that but a very small percentage of the amounts shown in the Customs returns of this place are .or local consumption. The greater part goes to the interior of Persia and to Hamadan, whence it is distributed to the various larger towns of the district. This tract of country is also supplied from Resht. For instance the steady decrease under the heading 'Tea from India' must be explained by a corresponding increase at some other point of entry into Persia and I am inclined to think that a study of the returns for Resht this year will very probably explain this decrease of over £14,000 in the last four years. It is at any rate certain that no decrease m tea drinking can be brought forward to explain it. A ppointments and T ransfers. British. —Captain Beauchamp Williams, I.M.S., Consular Surgeon for Arabistan and Kermanshah, was transferred to Bushire and left Kermanshah on the 22nd April 1906. Captain Crossle, his successor, arrived on the 3rd August 1906. Captain H. A. K. Cough, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kermanshah, proceeded on combined furlough and privilege leave on the 10th August 1906, Captain H. Crossle, I.M.S., officiating until the arrival of Captain L. B. H. Hawortii, I.A., who took charge on the afternoon of the 11th October 1906. Russian. —M. Nicolski was the Russian Consul, his Secretary, M. arrived on the 25th April 1906. M. Nicolski went on six months' leave on the 12tli October 1906, M. Petroff officiating in his absence. Turkish. —Kerim Beg was Turkish Consul General. In the middle of the year the Turks complained against him and finally took 64 Bast ' in the Kermanshab Telegraph office. They also approached the British Consul, but it was expiamea to them that we could not interfere. Finally Kerim Beg was transferred to laDriz and left Kermanshah on the 10th February 1906 having handed over cnarge to Ahmed Beg, the Consul. I may state that he has returned once more to Kermanshah and is not to go to Tabriz. On hearing of his projected return Ahmed Beg tried to obtain a sick certificate. He told the Russian doctor toPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1908-1907. 43 whom he went for the purpose that his soul was not his own under Kenm Beg. For some extraordinary reason the reply from Constantinople came through M. Petroff, who informed Ahmed Beg that he had got to remain in Kermanshah. M*. Petroff informed me that he had never quite understood the reason for this form of procedure and had always imagined it must have been a mistake. Persian. Amir Afkham was Governor of Kermanshah until the last week of the year when he was dismissed owing to his incompetency in dealing with Kermanshah difficulties. His successor was Saif-ed-douleh, the Governor of Buruiird, a person far more incompetent to deal with the matter before him. Farid-ul-mulk, Karguzar, was dismissed and Sharif-ul-mulk was appointed in his place. Customs.— I k the Customs department M. Waffelaert was transferred to Bushire and left on the 27th January, being relieved by M. Heynssens from Bushire, a very pleasant change for Kermanshah. Baron Staudach, a Persian subject and a Mussalman, but Austrian by birth, arrived in Kermanshah as Inspector in the Customs Department. His habits are entirely Persian and he is more unscrupulous than most Persians. I was glad to see him dismissed later. Dispell s(iry.—The Consulate Dispensary has been a great success , the average number of patients has been over 100 per diem, the record day being 164. The majority of the patients have been Kurds, but the Persians are increasing in number. L. HAWORTH, [lis Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kermanshah. SUt F. D.44 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF CHAPTER IV.—KERMAN POLITICAL REPORT FOR THE YEAB 1906-1907. Colonel Stewart was His Britannic Majesty's Consul from the 1st of April to the 13th October 1906, when he was succeeded by Major Ducat who continues to hold the post. The Russian Consulate was in charge of Mr. Adamoff throughout the year The Farman Farma was Governor-General of Kerman and Persian Baluchistan with his son, the Nasrat-ud-dowleh, as Deputy Governor until the 16th February 1906, when he was summoned to Tehran and appointed Minister of Justice. The Nasrat-ud-Dowleh was the appointed Governor-General with the Salar-i-Mansur as Advisor, but the latter refused to accept the somewhat invidious post, and the Nasrat-ud-Dowleh was left in sole charge. The Adil-us-Saltaneh was appointed Deputy Governor. The Government practically remained in the hands of the Farman Farma. who was in constant communication by wire with the Nasrat-ud- Dowleh. In the month of April 1906 a British Vice-Consul, Lieutenant Ogilvie, was appointed to Bam and arrived there in June 1906. He remained there till the end of the year. The Akhram-us-Mulk, who was Karguzar at the beginning of the year, was transferred to Seistan in January 1907. The Ittala-ud-Dowleh had been appointed Karguzar, but owing to the opposition of the Farman Farma had not taken up the post of Karguzar, but had been appointed Chief Justice instead. As this new post was still more unpalatable to the Farman Farma and the Ikram -ul-Mulk was not allowed to stay, he got the Ittala-ud-Dowleh appointed Karguzar instead. The latter was foolish enough to try at first to hold both posts and put himself in opposition to the Farman Farma and Nasrat-ud-Dowleh who was by the time Governor-General. The Farman Farma thereupon brought about his dismissal and he was recalled to Tehran. The Karguzari office was left in charge of Mirza Habibullah Khan, the head clerk, for the rest of the year. Under the firm rule of the Farman Farma the district was unusually quiet and the year was fortunately uneventful. The only serious disturbance occurred in Baluchistan in the month of February 1907 when Ibrahim Khan, who had re purchased his ancestral fort at Sarju, successfully defended it against the Governor of Baluchistan, who had unjustly sold it again. A Persian Sartip and a few local levies were killed and about twenty of the levies wounded. The Persian Governor retired and Ibrahim Khan has since been left in triumphal possession. The events in Tehran and the struggle between the Shah and the Majlis roused very little interest in Kerman. The death of the late Shah luckily caused no local disturbance. The most influential Mullah preached to the people advising them to remain quiet and mourn publicly for His late Majesty. The people of Kerman thereupon went into mourning for Muzafiar-ud-Din Shah while his own sons were attending school as usual and his capital going about its business as if nothing had happened. The attempted founding of the National Bank caused a certain amount of interest and talk, but nothing more. Money was promised by a number of people, but none was, or is ever likely to be paid. Tlle elections of members for the Tehran Majlis were held in January and ebruary, but there was very little enthusiasm and no serious disturbance over A local Majlis was established in January and held a few meetings without any resu s and then adjourned to await the arrival of the Nizamnamah frompolitical residency for 1906-1907. 45 Miscellaneous. —The rains were good and the crops are doing well. The line of telegraphs connecting India and Persia was completed in March 1907 and the first overland through message sent from Tehran to Karachi via Quetta. The line will, however, not be open for general traffic till next year. No improvement was made in communications during the year. The road to Bander Abbas was fairly safe, but the roads northward and westward were fre quently infested by robbers. Trade was as flourishing as it can be expected to be under the existing difficul ties of transport and has been more fully dealt with in the Consular Report. C. DUCAT, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman,46 ADMHSTISfRATlON REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP CHAPTER V.— POLITICAL REPORT OE THE BUNDER ABBAS CONSULATE FOR 1906-1907. tQ 0 Q. ■ ' General. The year imder review has been characterized by intense unrest and discontent among the inhabitants of the town and the Hinterland generally. The lassitude and culpable neglect evinced by the local authorities in the discharge of the simplest duties incumbent upon them in the discharge of their office, did much towards promoting this unrest, while the oppression employed hy the Deputy Governor, Haji Mahomed Khan, during his termof office and more especially when touring in the Shamilat district, h^ been the cause of numerous lawless acts and robberies by way of retaliation on the part of those who were oppressed. In fact, both in the town itself and in the Shamilat, those charged with the administration have invariably preferred to resort to plunder and oppression rather than maintain their true role as officials of the Government, and in these circumstances, it is not surprising that those with a natural inclination for lawlessness should have taken the clue from their rulers and indulged their taste by engaging in every kind of lawless enterprise. The general untest was undoubtedly accentuated d%umg,-tha lattfir hali oi th^-year by reason of the illness and death of the Shah and the wild rumours prevalent regarding the reform of the Constitution, but it cannot- be averred that, given the absence of these events, the district would 'have remained even normally quiet. The prevailing disquiet exercised a very damaging effect on the trade of the port and was taken full advantage of by many unscrupulous traders in seeking to avoid their obligations. Change in Local Authorities.— Mahomed Khan continued to fill the post of Deputy Governor up to the 16th January 1907, when he was replaced by the Ikhtidar-i-Nizam, a Persian Artillery-man, who never settled down to his work and was dismissed after holding office for barely six weeks. He, in turn, was succeeded, as a temporary measure, by Baba Khan, the local Yahvar of Artillery, who re mained until the end of the Persian year when he handed over the duties to Mirza Abbas Khan Amin-al-Vizareh, the local representative of the Persian Foreign Office. Mirza Abdulla, Midhat-al-Vizarez, held charge of the local Karguzari at the commencement of the year, and on his death on the 25th April 1906, his son, Mirza Abbas Khan, was appointed Karguzar. At Lingah, the Deputy Governor, Safar Ali Khan, was replaced towards the end of the year by the Masood-al-Mamalik. Mir Ahmed Shah Khan has been Kalantar of the Shamilat throughout the year and has earned unenviable notoriety by reason of his numerous deeds of oppression. Minab has continued under the Deputy Governorship of Kerbelai Mahomed Hassan, from whom the Consulate has received considerable assistance in the settlement of cases between British-Indian and Persian subjects residing within his jurisdiction. Jurisdiction on Kishm Island has been exercised by Shaikh Hassan, a man of Arab sympathies who has from the first evinced a disinclination to serve his Persian taskmaster, the Moin-ut-Tujar. The Moin-ut-Tujar's authority on Hormuz Island has been upheld by the Kalantar, Mirza Khalil, whose principal work would seem to be the superintendence of the Red Oxide quarry and the conveyance of the Oxide to the steamers which periodically call here. Attitude of Persian Officials and disadvantages experienced hy British-Indian Traders. —When asked to sanction any trifling innovation which involves even » slight departure from the ante diluvian customs in vogue, the local authorities invariably adopt a non-possumus attitude, while the apathy and in many cases wilful neglect displayed by them in dealing with the claims of British subjects.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 47 involves months of delay before a settlement can be arrived at, while too often the defendant seizes the opportunity thus offered to him and decamps, rendering a settlement impossible. Cases of fraudulent bankruptcy and flight have been increas ingly frequent during the past year, the absconding debtors invariably betaking themselves to Lar, whence all attempts to dislodge them and secure their return to Bunder Abbas have hitherto proved fruitless. The majority of these fraudulent debtors are Laris, who after taking substan tial loans from the Hindus, place themselves under the pretection of the Deputy Governor of Lar, who in return for a portion of their ill-gotten gains, is always ready to deny that the debtors are within his jurisdiction. Secure in their retreat at Lar, debtors either ignore the claims of their creditors, or from their advantageous position, are able to dictate such terms of settlement as are beneficial to themselves after which they are free to return to the town and to re-engage in trade as honest merchants until such time as they find it convenient to repeat their former coup. Insecurity of the Trade Routes. —There has been no improvement as regards the security of the trade routes, and if there have been fewer instances of looted caravans than in former years, it is rather due to the fact that when the roads were known to be specially unsafe caravans did not traverse them, than to any actual increased security. The beginning of the year saw Kal Siraj, a former Kalantar of Finn ( £fj v -J aj ) engaged in hostilities with the newly appointed Kalantar, and as a consequence, many disturbances took place in the country to the north of Bunder Abbas. In April the Lar road was rendered unsafe by reason of the depredations of Haji Talib Khan, who had previously been expelled from the Deputy Grovernor- ship of Lingah. In November serious disturbances occurred in the Tarum ( Ojljj ) andForg \ ^^ ) districts, occasioned by the rival claims to the Deputy Governor ship of the respective nominees of the Shoa-es-Sultaneh and the Kowam-al-Mulk ; heavy fighting took place and many lives were lost, while for some weeks, caravans were forced to make a long detour in order to avoid the disturbed districts. In December, the caravan traffic on the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road was suspended for some weeks, owing to the presence of bands of robbers on the roads a Jiruft Hindu ventured to despatch five donkeys with goods from Bunder Abbas, but they were looted near Navergu ( ) in Fars territory, and although after much pre varication, the Fars authorities admitted that the place was within their jurisdiction satisfaction had not been afforded at the close of the year. Turning to Bunder Abbas and its immediate vicinity, robberies in the town have been rare, but the villages in the neighbourhood and to the north-west of the town have suffered much from the depredations of a certain Mullah Hassim, who is said to enjoy the protection and support of Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Deputy Governor of Lar. Although this outlaw has on several occasions yentured to within a few miles of the town, the local authorities professed themselves as being powerless to effect his capture. In February much apprehension was caused by the presence at Ziarat ( ), a village within 30 miles from Bunder Abbas, of a force of some 75 armed men, who having descended from the Tang-i-Zagh ( ^ ), demanded satisfaction for the oppression and extortion to which the tribes had been subjected by Haji Mahomed Khan, who had lately been removed from the Deputy Governorship of Bunder Abbas. The force eventually withdrew and was pursued by Mir Ahmed Shah, the Kalantar of Shamil, who, however, on receiving a present of 40 Tomans, obligingly abandoned the pursuit. When on a visit to Minab in February, His Majesty's Consul witnessed the arrival of a large force of Sarbazes under Vali Khan of Kerman and Mirza Khan of Rudbar. The ostensible object of the raid was to collect reve nue from natives of Eudbar who had settled in the Minab district. The Deputy Governor of Minab fled to Bunder Abbas and sought telegraphic orders from his employer, the Moin-ut-Tuiar, but during his absence, the raiders committed sundry acts of pillage in the town and then withdrew. These numerous instances of unrest and disturbances in the district have been quoted at some length in order to show under what difficulties peaceful traders laboured in transporting their goods during the past year and the really pressing need which exists for the Persian Government to take some action by which these encumbrances shall cease to exist, but it is feared that in the absence of strong pressure from His Majesty's Government some years must elapse before the Persian authorities will be in a position to cope with the difficulty.4g ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN In connection witli the looting of the caravan with which three sowars of the Kerman Consular escort were travelling in March 1906, it is satisfactory to note that as the result of continuous pressure, the local authorities at the end of December, paid the full amount of compensation demanded by the Consulate. Illegal Taxes.—in spite of the fact that Article 3 of the Persian Customs Regu lations expressly lays down that such taxes as ' Dalali,' Kapandari,' ' Sar-i-Rig' or 4 Maidani' and 4 Pierage,' are illegal, all had remained in force with the knowledge of the Persian Government and had been included in the schedule of items of revenue to be collected by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. Eepeated representa tions by the Residency however at length achieved the desired result, and at the end of July His Excellency the Darya Begi issued orders for the suspension of all the above^ imposts with the exception of ' Pierage ' which continued to be levied until the beginning of January, when in response to further protests by the Resi- dency, it also was discontinued. Thus all those illegal demands which have in the past undoubtedly exercised a check on the expansion of trade, have now ceased to exist in Bunder Abbas itself. The tax ' Rahdari' has not been included among those enumerated above, as it is not levied within the jurisdiction of Bunder Abbas but at Ahmedi, Pur Rahdar, and Gharah, all within the Pars administration.' Seeing, however, that these places are situated upon the principal caravan routes bifurcating from Bunder Abbas the levy of the tax constitutes a hindrance to the trading interests of the town and the Residency has spared no effort to move the Central Government through His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, to secure the suspension of the tax, but notwithstanding repeated assurances to the Minister that orders for its discontinuance had issued, it continues to be levied with im- punity and there would seem to be no immediate prospect of its abolishment. Local enterprises. —In virtue of the concession obtained from the Persian Gov- .r- -x * ™ xx i ernment by the Sponge Exploration Syndi- Visit of M. Hatinoglou. . ti it tt i • % 6 cate, Mons. Hatinoglou arrived from Bushire on the 16th June. He was joined a few days later by seven Greeks who had arrived from Europe with the diving dresses and apparatus necessary for submarine exploration. Research work in the neighbourhood of Hormuz and Kishm Islands, which was carried out early in July, was said to have yielded disappointing results, and M. Hatinoglou and party left for Lingah on the 20th July. The Moin-ut-Tujar has from time to time made spasmodic efforts to turn Visit of Mr. Hamilton Gunn. f 0 advantage the mineral resources of the islands farmed by him and in furtherance of his latest scheme to work the numerous sulphur deposits in the neighbourhood and after smelting the ore to export pure block sulphur, Mr. H. Hamilton Gunn, a mining engineer whose services had been secured by Messrs. EUinger, the Manchester agents of the Moin, arrived from Europe on the 5th January. He devoted his whole attention to the sulphur quarry on the Kishm Island, situated 12 miles east of Bassidu and 8 miles inland from Doolab. As the result of Mr. Gunn's research works he has informed the Moin that the sulphur deposit is of considerable commer cial value, extending as it does for more than \ mile and to a depth of some 50 feet while the ore is estimated to contain 70 per cent, of sulphur. In these circum stances he has advised the Moin to bring out machinery for calcining the ore and to secure the services of experienced workmen from Sicily. Mr. Gunn is undoubted ly an able man, but the value of his work is considerably discounted by the fact that he is invariably intoxicated and has several times reduced himself to the verge of delirium tremens. In spite of the fact that his agreement enjoined strict secrecy regarding the results of his investigations, Mr. Gunn has freely imparted his information to any and all with whom he has comeSin contact. Taking advan- tage of Mr. Gunns temporary absence from the quarry. His Majesty's Consul landed at Doolab and proceeded to the spot early in March. The country between the coast and the quarry is of the wildest description and in order to prepare a road for the transport of the sulphur, considerable expense would be involved. Some 20 or 30 coolies were working at the quarry and large quantities ° re , . been excavated, but work has been carried on under considerable difficulties as there is no fresh water within 5 miles and all attempts to find it by sinking wells have failed. In view of these difficulties and of the Persian's proverbial disinclination to carry a work to a successful issue, it is very much to be doubted whether the Moin will really proceed with the enterprise.P olitical residency for 1906-1907. 1 40 The first ship of the Hamburg-American Line to visit the port was the Cmadia Germany's projects. which arrived on the 23rd August since when the Company's ships have called from time to time on the outward voyage. Previous to the arrival of the Canadia, Mr. Listemann, the German Consul at Bushire, visited the town and appointed a native as loca} agent. The latter has secured an office in an advantageous position on the sea-front, but hitherto the German ships have brought very little cargo and it has not been worth their while to call on the homeward voyage. Local merchants have been the recipients of sundry letters from the Deutsche-Orient Bank of Hamburg, offering its services in connection with their trading transactions with Northern Europe. There have also from time to time been unconfirmed rumours that a German Bank intends to establish a branch in the town, but no move of a political nature on the part of Germany has been apparent and the advent of the mercantile ships has been viewed with indiffer ence by local merchants. Customs Administration. —The local administration was in the charge of M. Stas up to the beginning of December and his strict interpretation of the Reglement Douanier and generally unbending attitude, produced many deadlocks with the local merchants and was the cause of constant friction. M. Stas was succeeded by M. Anton Wagner from Mohammerah, who since his arrival has by his conciliatory and unbiassed attitude, done much to reconcile the people to the presence of the Belgian administration. His evident desire to preserve good relations with the Consulate, has resulted in amicable settlements being arrived at in many cases in which a strict interpretation of the Reglement would have led to protracted proceedings and profitless results. The Hamal Bashi system continues to be made a source of grievance by the local trading community and is without doubt very detrimental to trade. Owing largely however to the petty jealousies existing between the different merchants united action on their part with the object of effecting reforms in the system, is not to be looked for. The principal cause of complaint is that the fees exacted by the Hamal Bashi for the removal and care of goods from the time they reach the pier until they are delivered to the consignees, are excessive in the extreme, and it is con tended that a reduction of these fees by fully frds would still provide a handsome margin of profit for the Hamal Bashi. The employment by the Customs author ities of the Hamal Bashi upon preventive and other duties foreign to his office, is also the subject of much adverse comment, seeing that he is supposed to be the servant of the merchants and not of the Customs-House; Arms Traffic. —It was thought that with the arrival of the new Customs S.S. Teherani, &amp; final blow had been given to any possible smuggling of arms in the Bunder Abbas-Lingah district, but this has been far from being the case and the closing months of the year witnessed several daring smuggling feats on the Clarence Straits, in the neighbourhood of Gatchin close to the Bunder Abbas-Fars border. These arms were all destined for the Deputy Governor of Lar, Haji Ali Kuli Khan, and their safe convoy inland was systematically carried out, a large armed force in each case accompanying them and openly defying the ten or twelve tufangchis which the Customs authorities were able to pit against them. The Deputy Governor of Lar has held his post for some years and is said to have acquired power sufficient to enable him to defy the Fars authorities. In these circumstances it is not surprising that the representations made by the Customs Administration against his lawless acts have hitherto proved fruitless. From uncertain information received from time to time by His Majesty's Consul, it would seem that there has been no diminution in the number of rifles smuggled ashore on the coast of Mekran, and in spite of the presence of His Majesty's ships of war, it is said the arms smugglers have had a prosperous season. Telegraph. —Through telegraphic connection with Henjam was established at the end of 1905, but the building of a telegraph office and the opening of the line to the public, has remained in abeyance throughout the year, owing in the first place to the obstinate obstruction of M. Stas, instigated by the Russian Consul, and subsequently to the neglect of the Persian Government to come to an understand ing in the matter. The Persian guard has remained stationed at the end of the cable and the Russian Consul's continued interest in the matter has been 3147 F. D. H10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP manifested on different occasions by his prompting the local authorities to enquire into and question any trifling innovation made by the clerk in charge. The latter has for the greater part of the year lived in tents pitched close to the condemned cable house, whence he transmits and receives messages for the Consulate only. Public Health and Quarantine. —No serious * epidemic has occurred in the district, but cases of small-pox have been very common in the town. Malarial fever has been more than usually prevalent among the native inhabitants and there has been no diminution in the number of cases of guinea-worm, caused it is thought, by the indifferent water supply. The Charitable Dispensary has continued in the charge of the Quarantine Medical Officer and has doubtless proved of considerable benefit to the poorer inhabitants of the town. At the same time, the advisabilty of placing the equipment for a charitable dispensary in the hands of a subordinate who is not precluded from taking fees and engaging in private practice, is thought to he open to question, while the fact that in this case, the individual is the Quarantine Medical Officer and as such is the servant of the Persian Sanitary Administra- tion, has the effect of concealing the source of the benevolence from those visiting the dispensary and thus there results no political influence. However with the completion of the new Consulate buildings and dispensary and the appointment of a Hospital Assistant to reside at the Consulate, these defects will disappear automatically. Assistant Surgeon Brumby was in charge of the local quarantine up to the 3rd September, when he was relieved by Assistant Surgeon Montgomery. Both at Bunder Abbas and Lingah, the Quarantine Medical Officers have latterly experienced considerable obstruction from the Russian Consul, in the discharge of their duties, the Russian's attitude being evidently inspired with the hope that any action taken by him would serve as an attack upon the British Administration of Gulf quarantine generally. On the 27th December, M. Belayew boarded the Russian S. S. Trouver in advance of the Quarantine Medical Officer and acting on orders received from the Russian Consul, prevented Assistant Surgeon Montgomery from boarding the ship and carrying out his duties. Later on, acting under instructions from the Russian Consul, the Captain of the Russian S. S. Euphrates refused to accept a certificate of pratique from the Quarantine Officer, unless such certificate were rendered in French or Persian. Early in March a Russian Consulate employe boarded the mail S. S. Madura, notwithstanding the fact that she was flying the quarantine flag. On the deck, he was confronted by a quarantine guard whereupon he struck and abused the latter and then returned to his boat. On the Assistant Surgeon requesting the Russian Consul to send his man to quarantine he was met by a blank refusal and a counter-charge of assault was proffered against the guard. Instances such as these, all point to the necessity for a commissioned officer being placed in charge of the local quarantine, an official who would be m a position to enforce the regulations and to prevent the administra- tion of the Gulf quarantine being held up to ridicule and scored off through the medium of a man who by reason of his meagre education can hardly be expected to display that firmness and initiative so essential in order to combat such an expe rienced obstructionist as is the present Russian Consul. Slave Trade. Out of 130 applications for manumission, 89 received freedom cerancates at Bunder Abbas and 26 certificates were forwarded by the Consulate lor delivery to the slaves who had taken refuge in the British Agency at Lingah. There were no instances of direct slave-dealing in Bunder Abbas or its immediate vicinity, but there was one case of a suspicious nature in which the onaikn ol Henjam appeared to be involved ; unfortunately, however, the informant disappeared while the matter was under investigation and no definite proof could alterWards be obtained. Henjam Affairs —Much perturbation and unrest existed among the Arabs of enjam a e commencement of the year, owing to the expressed intention of the Customs authorities to build a Customs-House on the Island. The work was. owever, na y abandoned, the Customs perforce contenting themselves with a mat hut established within the limits of the British Telegraph Station. The local ustoms Mudir has not ventured to interfere in any way with the Arab village andPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR I906-1907- 51 so long as he abstains from doing so, there is perhaps but slight cause for apprehend ing trouble. His Majesty's Consul visited the Arab village in March and found that while the people view the presence of the Customs Mudir within British limits with contempt, they express the determination to resist any attempt to impose Customs dues or Persian sovereignty on the inhabitants of the Island generally. Tours. —Owing to the complications regarding the establishment of the Bunder Abbas Telegraph office, no tours were undertaken during the earlier months of the year. In September His Majesty's Consul paid a visit to Yasin, 12 miles north of Bunder Abbas, and in October the stone quarries of Hormuz were inspected in order to discover a suitable one from which to bring stone for the new Consulate building. On the 11th December, His Majesty's Consul left by Consulate boat for Lingah, Bassidu and other places on the Clarence Straits being visited en route. On the 31st January, the Consul left for Minab and afterwards visited Shamil and Kush- Kuh, the mountain at the latter place being ascended with a view to the possible discovery of a suitable hot weather camping ground. On the return journey, visits were paid to the numerous hamlets in the Shamilat. In March, Henjam was visited and afterwards Doolab on the Clarence Straits, whence a hasty visit to the sulphur quarry in process of exploration by the Moin-ut-Tujar was made. His Majesty's ships Sphinx and Lapwing visited the port at various times and His Majesty's cruiser Highflyer arrived on the 21st March leaving again on the following day. The Highflyer, Proserpine, Sphinx and Lapwing have all visited Henjam, the two latter making prolonged stays there from time to time. The E. I. M. S. Lawrence called on numerous occasions and the Political Resi dent landed from her on the 14th November leaving again the same day. No foreign men-of-war visited the port during the year. Russian Consulate. —Monsieur G. Owseenko has retained charge of the Russian Consulate throughout the year. During the past six months the personnel of the Consulate has been considerably augmented and extraordinary activity has been manifested in the collection of news of every description. The Consulate buildings have been enlarged and further additions and improvements are in progress. There is no doubt that the Consulate is most advantageously situated for watching the trend of local events, and from this point of view, it is matter for regret that a site for the new British Consulate was not selected within the town. Monsieur P i mi try Belay ew arrived from Kerman on the 1st August 1906 and has remained here as Assistant to the Russian Consul; he does not reside in the Consulate itself, but occupies a house on the outskirts of the bazaar. The Sidad-es-Sulteneh, formerly Russian Consular Agent at Bunder Abbas, was despatched to Lingah in the same capacity on the 1st January 1907, but re turned to Bunder Abbas on the 22nd March. In addition to M. Belayew and the Sadid-es-Sultaneh, the Russian Consul has on his staff no less than four capable munshis, among them being one Mirza Abul Kasim, who was formerly in the service of the Residency at Bushire, but who was dismissed for misconduct. Numerous spies, derived from the scum of the local bazaar, are also retained for the purpose of collecting news. Official Changes. —Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., was Assistant Resi dent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul up to the 23rd July 1906, when he left for Maskat after handing over charge to Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, I.A.

[For the approximate boundaries of these divisions see Administration Report for 1905-1906.] BIYABAN. Little news of importance has been received from Biyaban District during the year. It has been chiefly concerned with the dissensions between Mir Haji and Mir Barkat which receive mention in the note on the Jask District with which Biyaban is intimately connected. JASK DISTRICT. The Jask District has been quiet during the year, and no disturbances have occurred. Mir Mustapha Khan and Mir Genera1 ' Hoti are fortunately exempt from paying taxes to the Persian Government. They are well liked and respected by the inhabitants who are enabled to live contentedly without being burdened with heavy taxes. Mir Barkat, younger brother of Mir Mustapha Khan, has not resumed his former habit of trading in slaves, and no Slave Traffic. instances have come to light during the year. Early in the year Mir Barkat was appointed Chief of the Biyaban District and trouble has continued throughout the year Biyaban District. w ith Mir Haji, the former Chief of Biyaban, who refuses to vacate the Chieftainship. Small engagements have periodically occurred between the two parties, in which there have been a few casualties. According to recent information a settlement has been arranged, by which Barkat receives one-fifth of the district. The Jask District produces chiefly dates and wheat, both of which prove to be good crops; barley and mustard are Products of jask. also sown in small quantities. GAIH DISTRICT. In June, Sardar Syed Khan journeyed to Charbar to attend the meeting of Chiefs for the settlement of British Indian GeiieraL claims. During his absence the town of Gaih was attacked by one Kamal Khan, who was formerly Chief Wazir of Syed Khan, but who owing to a disagreement, cut himself off and has for years lived in a veri table stronghold amongst the Shigin hills, from which he makes periodical raids on the town of Gaih, and the surrounding district. On Syed Khan's return from Charbar he attacked Kamal Khan's position, assisted by Persian troops from Bam- pur, but they were unable to do more than destroy villages and date groves be longing to Kamal Khan and his followers. Kamal Khan died in August 1906 and has been succeeded by his son Saidi, who carries on his father's enmity against Syed Khan. In October 1906, Sardar Syed Khan, accompanied by Mahmiid Khan, the Governor of Bampur's representative, came south to collect taxes from the various districts under Gaih. They arrived at the town of Dashtiari in November, which54 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF they made their headquarters. The Dashtiari tax was promptly paid, but trouble arose with the Chiefs of Baho, details of which will be found under 'Baho District.' Minor Chiefs and headmen of the sub-districts under Gaih complain even more bitterly than last year of Syed Khan's exorbitant demands. The recognised annual tax payable by each small district has been collected three times during the year. In consequence of this increasing oppression the migration of the poorer Baluchis to India and to the Arab Coast continues. It is only necessary to deal with those sub-districts under Gaih which call for special remarks. Karwan is the largest minor district under Gaih. The northern portion is controlled bv Mir Dost and Mir Alse, both Karwan sub-district. f airl y influential men, and the southern portion by Mir Gool Mahomed, Mir Esa Sher Khan and Mir Shasowar. In November 1906, the Persian authorities established a Customs officer, with a guard of two men, at the port of Galeg, principally with a view to inter cepting arms, but even local natives ignored their presence, and after being greatly harassed and threatened, they returned to Charbar. With reference to the mention of Mir Sheroo in last year's report as being the son of Mir Syudullah it now appears Bir sub-distnct. that the former is not the son but the younger brother of Mir Syudullah, and is about 24 years of age. It was hoped that Mir Syudullah could be cured of his unfortunate malady, but it seems now expedient to appoint a new headman, or rather to divide the subsidy between Mir Sheroo and his uncle Mir Sahib Khan. The reason of this division of the subsidy is that Sheroo is a headstrong and rather irresponsible youth, and local opinion which was divided, showed Sahib Khan to have the greater influence. Sheroo was inclined to be jealous of his uncle, but they have been brought together, and they now appear to be friendly and both perfectly satisfied with their positions. Arrangements have also been made that Mir Syudullah and his family shall be properly looked after. An arrangement is understood to have been made by Captain McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, with the Chiefs of Karwan to assist in puttings down the arms traffic, but there is little doubt that the three chiefs in charge of the coast al portion of the Karwan District are perfectly powerless, even collectively, to pre vent Afghans from landing arms on the coast. Large numbers of Afghans receive the consignments on the beach, and are well prepared to resist any local inter ference. Local chiefs are also liberally bribed and it is not to be supposed that they would give any but valueless information. The favourable season is evidently October to the end of March ; but although no arms were landed in December, January, or February, it is known that con signments were waiting in Maskat for shipment, which were delayed partly by the presence of His Majesty's ships patrolling the coast and also owing to the fact that the Afghans experienced some difficulty in obtaining native craft to convey them across. It will be observed that a good many arms are consigned to Sardar Syed Khan of Gaih, whom we formerly suspected of helping the Afghans, and there is reason to believe that he has been made a partner in the undertaking in return for his assistance. Every possible endeavour was made by the staff of the Indo-European Tele graph Department to co-operate with His Majesty's ships, and as last year Mr. E. H. New, Assistant Superintendent, Jask sub-division, rendered yeoman service in this regard. Strict orders were issued to the Ranch and Sadech telephones to come into circuit three times a day (at sunrise, noon, and sunset) and it was particularly explained to the line-guards in charge that the most valuable information would be the movements and exact position of any collection of Afghans or camels. An extra telephone station was also established at Jagin River, with similar orders to cut in and report thre^ times daily.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 55 A comparison of the items of news furnished by the line-guards with the itineraries of the smuggling caravans clearly shows that the information supplied by telephone stations, although good and reliable, was received much too late. It must be remembered that Jagin telephone is situated 14 miles from the beach, the country for miles around the mouth of the J agin Kiver being marshy and inter sected by water, courses, and the line-guard who is single-handed, had to travel over miles of bad ground to gather information which was reported to Jask by tele phone only on his return. It must also be remembered that the Afghans themselves have very little idea of the exact position at which the arms will be landed, and that they employ scouts along the coast who report at once to the main body when their boat is sighted. The traffic is undoubtedly increasing, and, judging by the freedom with which the Afghans are empowered to expend money on boat hire, camels and bribery, the undertaking is evidently being cleverly organised by some prominent person or society. The Afghans pay a liberal fee to local chiefs in lieu of Customs duty. slave Traffic reports have been furnished pointing to the continuance of any traffic in slaves from the ports of Gaih. The seasonal rainfall was late but satisfactory, and the crops of dates, rice, barley, jowari and cotton should do well, products of Gaih. The export of sheep to the Arab Coast is increasing. DASHTIAM DISTRICT. The brothers Mir Abdi Khan and Mir Mahmud Khan were with difficulty , persuaded to attend the meeting held at Charbar in July. Mir Abdi Khan has for some years been at enmity with Sardar Syed Khan of Gaih, but a reconciliation has lately been arranged and they are now the best of friends. Both the brothers were in attendance on Syed Khan during the whole of his tour through the Dashtiari and Baho Districts. The district is in a comparatively flourishing condition, and no disturbances of any kind have occurred during the year. u j , ^ . The rainfall has been good, and the barley, Products of Da.ht.an. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ BAHO DISTRICT. The Baho District has been in a state of disorder almost throughout the year. On the 9 th November, a nephew of Mir Ashraf Khan, named Kadirbux, was murdered by Jalal Khan, brother of Mir Ahmed Khan. There has been a blood feud between the families for some years past, but it is said Ahmed Khan was the instigator of this particular crime. Early in November Sardar Syed Khan of Gaih, and the representative of the Governor of Bampur arrived at the town of Dashtiari, from where they opened negociations with the Chiefs of Baho for payment of the annual tax. Mir Ashraf Khan declined to collect the full amount demanded by Syed Khan, on the ground that Syed Khan had previously agreed to reduce the tax from 1,200 ' Sonars ' (Rs. 6,000) to 800 ' Sonars ' (Rs. 4,000) on account of the acknowledged poor condition of the district. Ahmed Khan, who was only waiting for a favourable opportunity to depose Ashraf Khan, volunteered^ to collect the full annual tax, and an additional sum of 1,000 'Sonars' (Rs. 5,000) as blood money for the murder of Kadirbux. Syed Khan and the Governor's representative readily accepted the offer, and on about the 13tli November Ahmed Khan was appointed Chief of Baho. It was arranged that Ahmed Khan, while raiding, would be accompanied by Mahmud Khan, brother of Syed Khan, probably because he could not be trusted and he wats moreover supplied with a personal bodyguard of ten mounted Persian soldiers. He was given a perfectly free hand, the only restriction being that British Indian subjects were not to be molested. Ahmed Khan commenced his56 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF ravages quite diplomatically by appealing to the people of Baho, promising not to take'more than the usual legitimate tax paid annually by each village. Some trust ed him, but the majority fled to the hills and adjoining districts, while a good many took refuge at Dasht Eiver in British territory. On the 26th November Ahmed Khan visited the Assistant Superintendent in camp and asked permission to follow his own subjects into British territory. Communications on this subject were ex- changed between the Residency and the Honourable the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan, with the result that it was decided to resist his entry and when he saw that permission to enter British territory would not be granted he redoubled his predatory energies, and by the end of December he had looted cattle to the approximate value of Rs. 15,000. The valuation for live-stock accepted by Syed Khan was as follows Rs. Camels .,.&gt;••••• i 50 each. Cows and bullocks . . . . &gt; • • . 25 „ Donkeys .... 20 „ Goats and Sheep ........ 2 „ An instance, which came under notice, may illustrate Ahmed Khan's methods and treachery. While at Dashtiari Chil, the Assistant Superintendent was sur prised to find that the inhabitants of a small but prosperous village of ' Latis' were contentedly carrying on their daily work as if nothing unusual were happening in the district. On enquiry they informed him that Ahmed Khan had already collected their tax and promised not to trouble them further. Shortly after Ahmed Khan appeared again, and shattered their faith in him by demanding a second instal ment of tax. The village then thought it expedient to move, with their remaining belongings, to British territory, but unfortunately they encountered Ahmed Khan on the ^Dasht road. He was accompanied by a small escort, and on the Latis refusing to pay further extortions, a fight ensued, in which the villagers lost two men who were shot, and all their remaining property was confiscated. In this manner Ahmed Khan eventually managed to collect the necessary sum of Rs. 10,000, but in the performance of his wild endeavour to please Syed Khan he has made many bitter enemies amongst the inhabitants of Baho. Mir Ashraf Khan is a weak man, but he has the advantage of being well liked and respected by the people of Baho, whereas Ahmed Khan is feared and hated throughout the district. I hear Baho subj ects are gathering round Mir Ashraf Khan to assist him in regaining his former position. For the past three months there has been a determined scheme on foot to murder Ahmed Khan, and considering the havoc he has recently created in the district, I am surprised that this has not already occurred. Comparing the two men, from our point of view, Ashraf Khan is undoubtedly the better man. He is of a better family ; he treats his subjects with great consideration ; he is very willing to assist us and always ready to do what he is told; he has a good record and has no propensity for looting, and moreover, his most valuable asset is, that he has the whole of the population of Baho behind him. If Ahmed Khan retains the Chieftainship of Baho, law and order can only be maintained by the sword and the district will always be in a state of revolt. The southern portion of Baho is a salty plain entirely unfitted for cultivation, Products of Baho. but tlie soil improves a few miles north of the telegraph line. The crops are chiefly barley, jowari and dhall, and although the rainfall was good, practically nothing was sown owing to the disturbed state of the country. P. Z. COX, Major, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*political residency for 1906-1907. 57 CHAPTER VII.—ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. i.—oman politics. The official year of 1906-1907 would have been a comparatively uneventful one for Oman as regards internal complications had it not been for a serious cala mity which overtook His Highness the Sultan towards its close, and deprived him of his strongest and most influential supporter. Before describing this dis aster and the circumstances connected therewith, the earlier events of the year may be briefly discussed. At the time of writing last year's report, the troops raised by the Sultan's General Sulaiman bin Suwailim for the Revolt of the Bam Riyam. purpose of quelling the revolt of the Bani Riyam were in occupation of the fort of Ziki, hoping and waiting for the arrival of re-enforcements which would render them strong enough to capture the village of Birkat-ul-Mauz. These hopes were not realised, but, late in May, Sulaiman, aided by treachery on the part of some of his enemies, managed to oust the Bani Riyam from the hamlet of Bait-us-Salit near Ziki to which is attached an extensive date plantation, and to occupy it himself without an engagement. This success satisfied the aspirations of His Highness for the time being, and the operations thereupon terminated. Upon the arrival of the news in Maskat His Highness released his prisoners, dressed his flagstaffs, and fired a salute of 21 guns in honour of his victorious General. On June 20th Sulaiman, having made the final arrange ments for peace which included the stationing of 30 'Askaris as garrison in Bait- us-Salit, arrived at Maskat, and was further complimented by a personal salute of 13 guns. As a result of this rising desultory warfare, comprising a few minor raids and occasional murders, was carried on between the Bani Riyam and the Bani Ruwahah until the end of the official year. In June an attempt was made by 40 men of the Ya'aribah tribe, acting ostensibly on behalf of the Sultan, to capture Attempted capture Of the fort of h M »m. t he foit of Hazam from Saiyid Said biu Ibrahim, His Highness's brother-in-law, in whose possession it had remained quietly for some years. This party, having bribed one of the door-keepers, obtained an entrance through the outer gate, but before they could push on the defenders suc ceeded in closing the inner defences and they were repulsed with a loss of five killed. Said bin Ibrahim, who at this time was on a visit to the Batinah Coast, executed the offending door-keeper on his return ; and also put to death four men of the Ya'aribah tribe who were in residence at Rustaq and upon whom suspicion fell of having been implicated in the attack. Two months later the Ya'aribah raided Hazam in revenge for these executions, burning a few huts and killing one in offensive villager ; and it was rumoured subsequently that Said bin Ibrahim in tended to plunder the Batinah Coast with the excuse of tracing the perpetrators of this outrage. Nothing further took place however, partly owing to Said's atten tion having been claimed by other matters. Early in the year the Shu'aibiyin ( ), a Hinavi tribe inhabiting Rendition of the fort of Kaihat to h. h . the Kalhat, a port some 12 miles north- ^ ultaI1 - west of Sur, owing to trouble^with the Bani Jabir of Taiwi, another port 8 miles to the north-west, built a fort for the protection of their village. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim, the Tamimah of the ■Bani Bu Ali, objected to this on account of the existing alliance between the Shu'aibiyin and his enemies the Bani Bu Hasan, and the Saltan at his request ordered the fort to be destroyed. Further disputes however caused it to be rebuilt, 3147 b. d—2-3 i58 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP and finally the Shaikh of the Shu'aibiyin handed it over to His Highness who has garrisoned it with his own troops. This arrangement appears to be a satisfactory one ; it tends to increase His Highness's authority in the neighbourhood, and may assist in the maintenance of peace. The intrigues of the rebel Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al Harithi and his friends ,,. ,. J have been much in evidence during the vmt Shaikh Isa bin Saleh Al Harithi and his friends. Attempts have ^ by them to cajole Saiyid Taimur, the eldest son of the Sultan, by working upon his youthful religious feelings and urging him to a stricter following of the Moslem creed than that adopted by his father. The object of these manoeuvres was to ob tain access to the Sultan himself by means of influence over his son, or, failing that, to sow distrust or even enmity between the prince and his father. At one time it seemed possible that their schemes would be to some extent successful, namely, when, early in November, Shaikh Ali, brother of Shaikh Isa, who had been brought to Eiyam, a few miles from Maskat, for the purpose of interviewing His Highness, was refused entrance to Maskat itself, to the disappointment of Saiyid Taimur, who had become convinced not only that the feelings of the Harithis to wards the ruling house had undergone a radical change, but that his views regarding them were shared by his father. Not long after this however the calamity above referred to took place, and any doubt which might have existed re- Murder of the W £tli • SulauiiEtn bin Suwctilini. .-i •. i?ci'L*iiT -ii mur r gardmg the enmity of Shaikh Isa and his party was effectually removed. It will be remembered that in September 1903 Said bin Ibrahim (who has already been mentioned in connection with Hazam) was appointed Governor of Eustaq by Shaikh Isa, and it is natural that His High ness has since been desirous either to bring Said under his control or to compel him to resign his position in favour of a nominee of his own. All efforts in the for mer direction having failed, His Highness, in accordance with a suggestion made to him by his enemies through a friend, determined to avail himself of the compara tive freedom of Oman from internal disturbances by forming an expedition against Eustaq, with the intention of coercing his brother-in-law into submission to his rule. With the object of obtaining an assurance from the Harithis that they would not oppose this plan, Wali Sulaiman bin Suwailim w T as despatched to Qabil in the Shar-qiyah at the end of January to interview Shaikh 'Isa. He was received with every sign of rejoicing, feasts were given and a salute was fired in his honour, and after four days' stay during which the Eustaq question had been disposed of according to the Sultan's wishes, he set out, in company with an escort com posed mainly of Shaikhs of the Harith and other Hinavi tribes, to return to Maskat and announce to His Highness the success of his mission. At about midday on February 5th, as the party were passing through the defile known as Al'Aqq which separates Wadi Samayil from the Sharqiyah, the Wali Sulaiman, who with his one servant had become separated temporarily from his escort, was struck by two shots fired from a cliff on the left bank and killed on the spot. His servant on going to his assistance was wounded by a third shot fired immediately afterwards and died of his wound the same evening. The bodies were roughly interred without any ceremony or funeral service, and the escort, having despatched a brief note to the Sultan at Maskat informing him of what had occurred, continued its journey to Samayil. This note arrived in Maskat on the morning of February 7th, and His Highness was naturally very much distressed at the news it contained. Eealising that the late hosts of the deceased Wali were open to grave suspicion of having been privy to his murder, and having received no information regarding their present intentions, he at once took steps to protect the Wadi Samayil from invasion in the event of a rising against him; and to this end despatched 200 men under his sons Taimur and Nadir with instructions to hold the fort of Bidbid and to communicate to him without delay any information they might receive which would enable him to come to a conclusion regarding the per petrators of the crime. The pass of Al'Aqq is in the country of the Siyabiyin, a Ghafiri tribe, and it was not long before they were accused of the murder ; the explanation being that certain Siyabis who were in charge of a caravan conveying supplies to the Bani Eiyam during their rebellion last year had killed the Wali Sulaiman in revenge for his capture of their caravan on that occasion. The Sultan requested ShaikhPOLITICAL RESIDENCY EOR 1906-1907. Saif bin Muhsin, the Siyabi Chief, to deliver these persons up to him for punishment, but the Shaikh declined on the ground of absence of proof and appealed to the Harithis to help him out of the difficulty. Shaikh 'Isa professes to have refused to listen to him and expressed his readiness to make war upon the Siyabiyin provided that the Sultan would first allow a discussion to take place on the subject, either between him and Saiyid Taimur, or between one of his followers and a person specially deputed by His Highness ; the interview to take place either at Samayil or at Maskat. His Highness has declined discussion, and still believing in the com plicity of the Hinavis in the murder is unwilling to accept their offer of assistance. He has some hope that the matter may be arranged and culprits secured through the assistance of the Ghafiri leader Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim, but this Chief has hitherto shewn no disposition to help, partly because he is convinced that the Harithis were the murderers, and partly on account of his being annoyed with Sir Saiyid Faisal owing to the latter having refused his mediation in connection with the recent revolt of the Bani Riyam. There is no doubt that the loss of Sulaiman bin Suwailim is a very serious one to the Sultan. His influence was felt more or less in every part of the country which is to any extent subject to the rule of His Highness, and in Dhufar in parti cular, the services rendered by him in connection with the establishment of law and order and the recognition of Sir Saiyid Faisal as ruler can hardly be overestimated. It will be difficult to replace him ; neither of his sons seem to have inherited their father's energy and capability, and the number of persons at His Highness's disposal who are really qualified to act as Governors of outlying districts is very small at the present time. II.—EPIDEMICS AND CASUALTIES. The health of Oman during the sumpaer was normal, and no epidemics properly so called occurred in 1906-1907. But malarial fever has been prevalent ^to an ex traordinary extent throughout the recent cold weather. Mosqnitoes have been far more numerous than they usually are, which is difficult to explain as the only pool of stagnant water to be found in Maskat is brackish, and a search that was made therein for mosquito larvae was unproductive. It is said that from December to March iu elusive there was hardly a house in the town and its suburbs in which ,, , ,, , i . at least one malarial case could not be Malarial fever in Maskat. „ , i.ijii • c ; i found; and that the average, ii taken, would have exceeded one per dwelling. The small community of Europeans and clerks, notwithstanding the comparative healthiness of their quarters, have suffered severely, no person having entirely escaped and one or two having been compelled to leave their posts either temporarily or permanently ; while the frequent indis position of individuals has thrown additional work upon their comrades. Moreover, there have been seven reported cases of blackwater fever, of which five have proved fatal, including one European, and it is believed that other cases have occurred which have not come to the notice of the medical authorities. The quarantine arrangements underwent no change during the year; they were carried on as hitherto under the surveillance of the Agency Surgeon and no com plaint of importance was made against his administration. A serious calamity fell upon the unfortunate town of Nizwa on the 8th Feb- „ , ruary. A flood occasioned by recent Flood at Nizwa. , J ^ heavy rams carried away the quarter known as Harat-ul-Wadi; about sixty lives were lost and many families rendered homeless. The quarter has since been rebuilt to some extent and the sufferers redomiciled. Fires occurred occasionally in Maekat and Matrah, but none were of any mag nitude or importance. III.—CUSTOMS AND FINANCE. In connection with the Customs there are no changes to report. The depart ment has been administered throughout the year by the former staff with the Bania Damodar Dharamsi as supervisor ; and owing to the increase in the importation of arms and ammunition elsewhere commented upon, and the almost unprecedented date crop of 1906, a decided improvement has taken place in the Sultan's financial condition. It is believed that the imperial debts amount now to about $40,000 only, $20,000 of which are owing to various merchants as money paid by them T 260 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF in advance on account of duty for which they will become liable subsequent] upon the arrival of merchandize. This may be regarded as a sort of standing a/ vance, as sums paid off are as a rule speedily required again before long, and th' total amount is of course liable to be exceeded in the event of sudden calls uponH' 6 Highness' s exchequer. Eoughly $70,000 of debts are said to have been settled during the year under review, the greater portion during the latter part thereo/ iv.—arms and ammunition. During 1906-1907 the following rifles, etc., were imported into Maskat and almost the whole quantity was re-exported before the end of the vear: Rifles. Revolvers. Cartridges. Of Belgian manufacture ..... 24,196 316 Of French „ 3,725 616 2,681,000 Of English „ 17,006 .. 4,564,000 The French rifles are very inferior being of an old military pattern, and are sold at a few dollars a piece. The total value of arms and ammunition imported is given at Rs. 16,85 075 against Rs. 10,74,380 for 1905-1906, an increase of Rs. 6,10,695, or about 56 per cent but the local selling value has fallen by about 17 per cent, on each rifle, so that the increase in demand has been even greater than appears from these figures. Belgian rifles were in demand early in the official year, but in 1907 the tide turned in favour of British weapons, on account of their greater reliability. His Majesty's ships of war have been employed since November in efforts to stop the smuggling of arms by Afghans and Baluchis over to the Mekran Coast by searching suspected dhows coming from Oman : but although at first the smu^. glers found it difficult to engage vessels owing to the presence of men of war, after one had succeeded in landing her cargo others had courage to follow and His Maj esty's ships were attended with no fortune up to the end of March, the smugglers having very narrowly escaped capture on two or three occasions. It is said that between six and seven thousand rifles with 100 rounds of ammunition to each were landed in Mekran between November and April The majority of the export was to Bahrein and Koweit, a considerable amount being earned by British India steamers, the commanders of which scarcely seem to be sumciently on the alert in this connection. During the year under report Monsieur P. Caracalla of Paris has instituted in Maskat a busmess to be known as the '' Bazar Pran 5 ais.'' Among other things he proposes to join m the Arms traffic. v.—french flag. som^nLT 11 * 0 f f I 11 ® £, efere f 5e tothe Hague Arbitration Tribunal of the trouble- Zf iS T t f t g m man Was g iven in last y ear ' s re P ort ' alld had ta W, T g0C ^ 10M settlement in accordance with the judgment which WH to Tt 06 « n 6 P0l i tlCal A 8 ent and the Frencl1 Consul were also re- owners fln/rlh officer ®. 1116111:10116,1 were unable to agree as 'to the number of dhow owners and dhows which were qualified to continue to fly French flags. The chief points upon which they differed were— g (1) M. Laronee held that authorisation to fly the French flag was given for each and every owner once for all, that is to say, foreverv dhow oi w ic e might subsequently become the possessor: whereas Major dho^^only aine authorisation was given in regard to individual (2) M. Laronoe represented that his Government would be obliged to insist ^ eir VleW ^ lv 1 en W accepted, and also that each autho- e ow owner should be allowed to replace any dhow at present i ^ possession of which he might subsequently become disposses sed by sale or by loss. J ^ on ^ a U the owners named in the list pre- nn+Ti • lm to ^ a J 0 r Grey on the 4th March 1906 f should preserve authorisation to fly French flags, but that all the dhows given in thePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOB 1906-1907. 61 list should be registered as 'being the property of the persons against whose names they were entered. But Major Grey as a result of care ful enquiry found (i) that some of the dhow owners are not strictly entitled to authorisation as they do not actually possess a dhow at the present time, and (ii) that many of the dhows are not the property of the persons against whose names they were entered. The question of the list was therefore referred to Europe, and certain matters connected with it are still being discussed between London and Paris. It is almost certain that a settlement will be arrived at before the end of the present official year ; and in the meantime, the fact that clause 6 of the arbitration award has already been put in force has strengthened the Sultan's position in connection ^rith Sur, a fact of which he hopes shortly to take advantage. VI.—SLAVE TRADE. Forty-six slaves applied for freedom at this Agency during 1906-1907. Of these forty-one were supplied with manumission papers ; the other five being found not to be entitled to freedom under treaty stipulations. With regard to the latter a bond was taken in each case by His Highness the Sultan from the master ensuring their good treatment in future. Of the forty-one freed twenty-six were Africans and fifteen Mekranis, all elected to remain in Maskat, but four of the Africans were sent to Bombay, it not appearing advisable to allow them to remain in Oman. In addition to the above, eleven Mekranis applied to the Agency for assistance in the recovery of some of their relatives from Oman and the Trucial Coast. Those in Oman were secured and made over, and letters were given in the other cases to the Shargah Agent who has also effected some recoveries. At the first glance the decrease in the number of slaves now applying for freedom seems curious, but the explanation is no doubt that organized slave trade between Oman and the African ports has for some years ceased to exist, and that the measures taken to terminate the importation of Baluchis and Persian slaves from Persian Mekran into His Highness's territories have been successful to a great extent. In connection with this trade there no longer seems to be regular work for His Majesty's ships in this immediate neighbourhood which is satisfactory. VII.—MARINE. Another case of looting on the Oman Coast unfortunately has to be reported. At the end of September the dhow ' Ganja Alamdad,'the property of Abdul Husain Ismailji of Cutch, coming from Nossi Be to Cutch Mandvie, stranded in the vicinity of Ras Madraka ; and, according to the statements of the Nakhuda, crew, and pas sengers, was looted by the Jennebeh and other Bedouins residing or wandering in the neighbourhood. The principal difficulties in these cases are to determine with any degree of accuracy the amount of indemnity which can reasonably be demanded on account of the damage for which the thieves are responsible, and to know exactly upon whom to fasten the guilt, as the natives of this part of the coast are not, strictly speaking, under the rule of any well known Shaikh who could be held responsible. Every enquiry is being made with a view to the settlement of the case. VIII.—RAINFALL. The rainfall of 1905-1906 was peculiarly favourable to the date plantation of Oman and the result was one of the best crops ever produced in the country. This year it is said to have been equally good and another bumper crop is hoped for. In Maskat and Matrah the raitifall has again been about the average ; and there have been no storms of any magnitude this year upon the coast. IX.—MOVEMENTS OF THE POLITICAL AGENT. Much of the Political Agent's time last year was taken up with the collection and correction of material for the Oman section of the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Serious difficulties have been met with owing to much of the country being closed to Europeans and in consequence very little known ; it is hoped however that the general result of the work done will be satisfactory.62 ADMIKISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF In addition to occasional inspections of coast ports a visit was paid in December to the distant province of Dhufar. This trip was undertaken partly in the interests of the Gazetteer, and partly to examine certain inscriptions of pro. Islamic origin said still to exist in the ruins of A1 Balaid, No trace could be found of anything pre-Islamic ; the oldest inscription found is that upon the marble tomb stone of A1 Malik Ibrahim bin Muzaffir, who is supposed to have been the first Arab Governor of the province. He died in A. H. 710. X.—RESIDENT'S VISITS. Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited Maskat in May, arriving on the 15th and leaving on the 17th, and again in July and Novem ber staying for two days each time. Visits were exchanged between him and Hip Highness the Sultan. &amp; XI.—NAVY. His Excellency Vice Admiral Sir E. Poe, Naval Commander-in-Chief, visited Maskat in H. M. S. Hermes on 22nd April 1906 on his return from the Persian Gulf, leaving on the 23rd. Official visits were dispensed with on this occasion. Other ships of His Majesty's navy which have been at Maskat during the past official year are the Diadem, Fox, Highflyer, Lapwing, Proserpine, Redbreast and Sphinx. The B. I. M. Lawrence and the Government Telegraph steamer Patrick Stewart also visited the port. XII.—FOREIGN NAVIES. The French torpedo destroyers Javeline, Rapiere, Sabre and Francisque arrived in Maskat from Bombay on 13th March and remained until the 17th. Their Commanders called on His Highness the Sultan, who returned their visit on board the Javeline, being saluted on his departure with 21 guns from each vessel. The four Captains also exchanged private visits with the Political Agent. No other Foreign Navy was represented in 1906-1907. XIII.—OFFICIAL CHANGES. Major W. G. Grey held charge of the Political Agency from the beginning of the official year until July 24th, and from 5th November until its close. In the interim he proceeded on privilege leave, and Lieutenant W. H. I. Shakespear offi ciated. Monsieur R. Laronce held charge of the French Consulate during the year. On October 15th Mr. Archibald Mackirdy of Messrs. W. J. Towell &amp; Company, who has acted as Consul for the United States of America for several years, handed over charge to Mr. W. Coffin, Member of the United States Consular service, who has been appointed Consul at Maskat on the re-organization of the service by his Government. The relations between the Political Agent and his Foreign colleagues have been most cordial throughout the year. Captain W. Lethbridge, I.M.S., was Agency Surgeon at Maskat until December 6th, when he proceeded on leave on relief by Captain N. Scott, LM.S., who still holds the appointment. W. G. GREY, Major, Political Agent &lt;&amp; His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Masqat.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1903&gt;1907. 63 CHAPTEE VIII.—ADMINISTRATION REPORT—TRUCIAL COAST OF OMAN, 1906-1907. The chief event of the year has been the progress of the feud between the Shaikhs of Abu Thabi and Ummel-Kaiwain, which eventually involved Debai Shargah and Ajman as well. The history of the earlier stages of this quarrel, of which the genesis lay in the question of the status and control of the Beni Kattab bedouins, was recorded in last year's report. Unfortunately the hope there expressed that a peaceful settle ment between the disputants was in a fair way of conclusion, was not destined to be fulfilled. In the month of April 1906 a written agreement was indeed come to between the two Shaikhs, which appeared to have disposed of the Beni Kattab difficulty and to have inaugurated a period of rest in the Trucial hinterland, and during the hot weather months following peace was duly preserved; but in October reports received from the Residency Agent at Shargah indicated that Abu Thabi intended to repudiate the settlement as soon as the month of Ramzan (November 1906) was over and to resume hostilities against the Beni Kattab. In this intention the Shaikhs of Shargah and Debai were expected to co-operate, and in furtherance of it Shaikh Zaeed began to collect and arm his Manasir and Beni Hajir bedouin adher ents. His first objective was known to be the fine oasis and aqueduct of Falai, created at much labour and expense during the last few generations by the Shaikhs of Umm-el-Kaiwain, about 20 miles from the coast, and used by the latter's adher ents as a rendezvous or refuge in troublous times. While the Chief of Abu Thabi was thus collecting his bedouins,Umm-el-Kaiwain was busy strengthening the fortifications and water towers at Falai, and about this time requested the good offices of the Resident in procuring two breech-loading guns, to be mounted in the Falai Fort. This request was of course refused and a forcible remonstrance was addressed to both Chiefs, urging them to accept arbitration instead of wasting money and lives in fighting over a matter which might easily be arranged by discussion. As the result of this remonstrance another peace was patched up between the parties, but from the sequel it was evident that the Shaikh of Abu Thabi only con cluded it with the treacherous idea of allaying Umm-el-Kaiwain's suspicions and of thus getting him and his adherents at a disadvantage. The letters of the Resident to the parties expressing his satisfaction at the news of their reconciliation could hardly have arrived when a report reached Bushire to the effect that Shaikh Rashid having ridden with a few shikari followers to Shaikh Zaeed's tents to pay him a friendly visit and to cement the documental peace at which they had recently arrived, had, after spending a few days as Shaikh Zaeed's honoured guest, been thrown into chains, and the surrender of Falai demanded from him as the price of his life. Fortunately at the time this news reached Bushire the Resident was contem plating a visit to Shargah accompanied by H. M. S. Proserpine with a view to putting pressure on the Shaikh of Shargah to settle some outstanding pearl diving claims, in accordance with the terms of the reciprocal Agreement among the Shaikhs regarding treatment of absconding pearl divers and their debts. H. M. S. Proserpine proceeded ahead with a letter for Shaikh Zaeed demanding the prisoner's release, the Resident following the next day, 17th February, in R. I. M. S. Lawrence. On arrival at Shargah it was found that, like vultures after carrion, the Shaikhs of Shargah, Ajman, and Debai had joined Shaikh Zaeed and were all in camp about34 ACMfNisTfeAfroN REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF 20 miles inland of Shargali where they had Shaikh Rashid in confinement and were preparing for an attack in force on Falai. It also transpired that Shaikh Rashid's captured followers had been sent as prisoners by sea to Abu Thabi; a distinct violation of the Maritime Truce. Special messengers were sent to the Shaikh of Shargah calling upon him to return home at once to interview the Resident and after some attempt at evasion he decided to comply ; and he having been got on board H. M. S. Proserpine, primarily in connection with the settlement of Shargah claims, pressure was put on him to assist the Resident in bringing the Shaikh of Abu Thabi to his senses. He was accordingly used as an emissary and after nearly a week's obstinate corre spondence, and endeavours by Shaikh Zaeed to make stipulations regarding Shaikh Rashid's release he was at length induced to release him unconditionally, but on the friendly understanding that the Resident would thereupon arbitrate an equit able settlement of their differences. Shaikh Rashid duly arrived at the coast under an escort, considerably reduced in proportions and in a somewhat nervous state after his six weeks' indurance, and was received on board the Lawrence as the Resident's guest. Two long days were then passed on shore in tedious discussion of the terms of peace, between Shaikh Rashid on the one hand and the Shaikhs of Shargah (repre senting also Ajman) and Debai (representing also Abu Thabi). A modus vivendi was at last effected and reduced to writing, and will, it is hoped, have the effect of maintaining peace among the Trucial Shaikhs for a longer period than their com pacts usually do. On the conclusion of the negociations the Shaikh of Umm-el- Kaiwain was landed at his port, where the town was en fete, and was received with much rejoicing. He himself seemed grateful for his deliverance and subsequently sent a thank-offering in the shape of a well-bred riding camel and a young horse, which were taken into Government employ. In the meanwhile H. M. S. Redbreast proceeded to Abu Thabi and brought back the imprisoned followers of Shaikh Rashid and landed them at their home and thus the incident ended. On receiving a report of the events just narrated the Government of India considered that further action in the direction of the exaction of a fine from the Shaikh of Abu Thabi for his treachery and breach of the Maritime Truce might be dispensed with. Shaikh Sagar according to his wont has given constant trouble to the Residency gliarcrah during the year owing to his extraordinary apathy in effecting the settlement of claims upon his subjects, and his callous disregard of the provisions of the Convention existing among the Trucial Chiefs regarding the treatment of absconding divers. According to the latter Convention he had rendered himself liable to a fine of several hundred dollars, and when the incident just narrated regarding the seizure of Shaikh Rashid was reported the Resident was just about to start for Shargah to endeavour to bring Shaikh Sagar to his senses. In order however to obtain his co-operation in the achievement of peace between Shaikh Rashid and Shaikh Zaeed and in view of his tractability in the question of the Abu Musa Concession, which was discussed at the same time and which has been dealt with in the Bushire report, it was thought politic to treat him leniently in regard to the claims outstanding against Shargah and therefore the Resident contented himsedf with taking from him a deposit of Rs. 3,000 as a guarantee of their early settlement. It was mentioned in last year's report that the Chiefs had been called upon to Trucial Flag % Orthodox Trucial Flag prescribed .iii , ^7 Treaty, and that after some demur they had apparently deferred to the wishes of Government. It was not long however before the Shaikhs of Abu Thabi and Debai put their n ea i s i e er a informed the Resident that the Flag which they were asked to ny nad been looked upon from time immemorial as the specific emblem of the ^ owafeini n e, and that as the Jowasmis (Shargah and Ras-el-Khaima) were of 6 1 P eisuas i 011 an d they themselves ' Hinawi,' their subjects refused to ^ ^4- P rescr ibed. Shaikh Ztioed added that only if the Sultan of Maskat agreed to change the Maskat Flag would he be willing to change his.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 65 As the reversion to the Treaty Flag had been proposed mainly in the interest of the Shaikhs, in order that the Belgian Customs Administration at the Gulf Ports might recognise Trucial Coast dhows as entitled to British protection, and as the j uncture was not propitious for any action calculated to disturb the equilibrium of the Trucial Coast generally, the Resident asked authority to drop the matter for the present and this course was approved. From much the same considerations, two other questions, namely, the institu tion of a Post office at Debai (now a regular port of call for the British India steamers) for which the British pearl dealers had petitioned: and secondly, the flying of the British Flag over the Residency Agent's house at Shargah for the better security of himself and the guidance of visiting men-of-war, were not for the time pressed by the Resident against the ignorant demurs of the respective Shaikhs concerned. We shall be better placed for pursuing to their issue such questions of minor but local importance when and if the looked-for conclusion of the Anglo-Russian settlement leaves us free to pursue our mission on the western shore of the Gulf without risk of prejudice therefrom to more important political problems under consideration. This case still remains unsettled and still furnishes the Shaikh of Abu Thabi with a convenient grievance which is drag ged forth on every possible occasion by that venerable but forward Chief. P. Z. COX, Major, Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 3U7 ^ D.66 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP CHAPTER IX.— ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BAHRAIN POLI TICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. GENERAL. The year under report has been on the General. whole a remarkably prosperous and healthy one for the people generally. The inter-racial disturbances in Hasa form an exception to this statement, and serious depreciations in the price of pearls in Bombay and Europe have cast a gloom at the end of the year over the principal financiers in this important trade. It is not likely, however, that any of the Pearling Magnates of Bahrein or Katif will incur ruin, though the position of Shaikh Jasim bin Thani of Katar seems very shaky financially. The general volume of Bahrain trade for the year 1906 has risen from Rs. 4,47,52,162 to Rs. 4,73,18,202, showing an increase of 5*73 per cent, on the previous year's figures, which had until then constituted the record. RAINFALL AND HARVEST. The rains this year have been scanty and late. The rainfall in Bahrain amounted to 2*17 inches, of which 1*62 inches fell in February. The crop of grass was therefore much below the average, and the un fortunate Persian butchers who import slaughter-cattle, sheep and goats for the towns of Manama and Muharraq were continually losing animals from starvation and kindred evils. The 1906 date-crop in Bahrain as well as in Hasa and Katif was extremely good. In consequence, however, of the insecurity of the trade-routes, the Hasa growers were very late in getting their surplus supplies down to the coast and up to Basra. PUBLIC HEALTH. The health of all parts of the Agency was good throughout the year, the only notable who has died being Shaikh Subah bin Hamud, a cousin of the Chief who. used to show him special consideration as being the only member of the family of greater age than himself. On the 9th November 1906, advantage was taken of the presence of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf—who had come to deliver personally to Khan Sahib Haji Abbas the Sanad of his title from the Government of India — to hold a public meeting for the opening of the Victoria Memorial Charitable Hospital, Nearly all the contributors to the Rs. 21,000 which the construction had cost, were present on the occasion, as were also the Chief of Bahrain and his sons, though these have subscribed nothing to the institution. After the Resident had delivered a short extern for e speech, the leading Arab merchant, Haji Muqbil adh Dhakair read a reply expressing gratitude to the British Government for their interest in and protection of Bahrain and wishing long life to the Ruler, Shaikh Esa bin Ali. On the 12th January 1907, Assistant Surgeon Ghulam Husain Monani, L.M.S., arrived from Plague duty at Parantij (Ahmedabad District) and assumed charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital. The average daily attendance from this date to the 31st March 1907 was about 30, and the popularity of the institution seems to be assured. BAHRAIN. All interest in the case of Shaikh Ali political. bin Ahmad, the exile, seems now to have expired.political residency sou 1906-1907. 67 In consequence of Shaikh Esa's apparent objections to supporting his nephew suitably in Bombay on an allowance of Rs. 600 per mensem, which he wished to diminish by half , and also owing to the apprehension of the Government of Bombay lest the detenu should abscond, the Chief was asked in July 1906 whether he could suggest a satisfactory alternative rendering Shaikh Ali's evil influence inoperative. When thus confronted with the possibility of his nephew's return to Bahrain, the Chief emphatically expressed his disinclination to have him back, and withdrew all objections to subscribing the monthly allowance required by the Government of Bombay. The question of the status of the Jews in Bahrain gave rise to some friction In April 1906. There are only about 50 members of this community in Bahrain, all of whom have come to the islands temporarily for purposes of trade during the last ten years. On the advice of a Mullah the Chief informed the Political Agent that he proposed to levy a special tax from the community, as was done in certain other parts of the world. The Government of India decided that these foreign Jews were entitled to receive as much British protection as was accorded to their fellow subjects of the Christian and Muhammadan religions, and the proposal was therefore disallowed. The Chief accepted unhesitatingly the Government's decision. In May 1906 the Chief consulted the Political Agent as to whether the Govern' ment of India would object to his raising a flag-staff on the open square to the east of the sequestrated house formerly occupied by Shaikh Ali bin Ahmad, and in lieu of the stafl which had formerly stood on the top of the said house. He was promptly informed that there was no objection to his proposal. Subscriptions were then invited from the public of Bahrain, and an imposing flag-staff, a few feet taller than the British staff, was erected in July 1906 during the time of the Political Agent's absence in India. The first occasion of flying the flag was observed with great rejoicings by the Arabs, the ceremony being presided over by Shaikh Hamad bin Esa, and a salute of guns being fired. The farm to the Hindu Syndicate of the one per cent duty of the Customs expired on 25th May 1906. The Chief thereupon authorized the Syndicated Manager to continue collecting the revenue on his behalf, until the farm of the four per cent duty should also lapse in January 1908A It. is understood that the Chief has not profited at all by this arrangement. German commercial activities in Bahrain have received a considerable impetus from the periodical calling of steamers oi the Hamburg-Amerika line at the port, and the appointment of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. as Agents for the line. With out this relief it is doubtful whether the firm would have continued much longer to do business here, as they feel the competition of Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. very severely. Even now, Messrs. Wonckhaus have not found it necessary to add any Europeans to their staff of one in the place. In June 1906 Mr. Sturken, Managing Partner of Messrs. Traun Stiirken &amp; Co., visited Bahrain with Mr. Wonckhaus in the course of a trip of inspection round the Gulf. These gentlemen called on the Chief of Bahrain in company with Mr. Eisenhut, the local representative of the firm. Mr. Sturken afterwards proceeded homewards through Tehran. The first Hamburg-Amerika Steamer Canadia called at Bahrain on the 26th August 1906 ; she was followed by six other vessels from Europe during the year under report, the average number of packages brought being only 738. Three of these vessels also called on the homeward run, taking a few pilgrims, some dates for Jedda and some mother-of-pearl shells for Hamburg. The German Consul from Bushire, Dr. Listemann, visited Bahrain twice, coming in the first steamer in August 1906 and again in the same vessel on the 22nd January 1907. On the first occasion the Consul seemed to entertain some idea of inter viewing Shaikh Esa in support of Messrs. Wonckhaus' application for permission to fly the Hamburg-Amerika Line's flag on a mast over their house, the second visit seemed only to have been made for the purpose of inspecting the Tumuli and excavations at 'Ali. On neither occasion did he call upon the Chief, having evi dently discovered the first time that Shaikh Esa was quite resolved not to allow unofficial foreigners to erect flag-staffs over their houses. 3147 F. D. k 268 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULP In November 1906 a young Arab woman, who had been divorced by her hus band took sanctuary in the Political Agency, stating that her life had been threat ened by ^ father and UIlcle - S ^ e waS plaCed in ^ he tem P orar y charge of the American Mission and her relations were communicated with. The result was unfortunate, and the woman suddenly disappeared about a week after her taking refuge. It is believed that she must have been helped out of the island by her native friends, but nothing ever was discovered as to her subsequent fate. The relations made an outcry, and a memorial was submitted to the Chief, signed by all his principal Muhammadan subjects, protesting against the Politicai Agent's treatment of the case. On receipt of the memorial from Shaikh Esa, the Political Agent replied that it would be forwarded to the Government of India for consideration, and also stated that neither he nor the missionary who had given the woman shelter knew anything about her going or whereabouts. The agitation then died down as quickly as it had arisen, and no further reference was made to the case. In September 1906 a subordinate of the Basra Post and Telegraph Department arrived in Bahrain to take over the duties, hitherto performed by a local Mullah, in connection with the transmittance of mails between Hasa and Katif on the one side and Basra on the other. It is not believed that the incumbent of the post, Abdur Rahim bin Haji Othman, was entrusted with any political mission, but he seems rather to have tried to acquire an official position over the lesser Turkish subjects in the place, and his actions are now being carefully watched. \ MOVEMENTS OF THE CHIEF AND HIS FAMILY. Shaikh Esa left Muharraq for his summer residence near Manama on the 3rd , ,^ n ,. , , July and returned to his winter quarters Movements of the Chief and his family. ; . ,v , j - i n ^ -i ^ L ' m Muharraq on the 30th September. He spent about 27 days during the year in camp, shooting and hawking. Shaikh Abdallah bin Esa left on a hunting expedition for Linga on the 8th December and returned to Bahrain on the 29th idem. Shaikh Muhammad bin Esa sailed for the mainland near Katif on the 11th December for the purpose of hawking and returned home five days later. The Chief's eldest son, Shaikh Hamad, spent the greater part of the cold weather at Sakhir in the centre of the island, where he has a house. KATAR. The peace of the Peninsula during the past year has been little disturbed, and the general pearling community enjoyed for some time a prosperous outlook in consequence of the abnormal prices they were ostensibly receiving from Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and the other few wholesale exporters for their pearls. A financial cloud has, however, since obscured the sky, as the drafts granted in part-payment have in many cases been dishonoured and the big buyers are talking of going into bankruptcy in order to get their liabilities reduced all round. The Political Resident accompanied by the Political Agent paid a visit in the Lawrence to Lusail, Doha, Hakra and Odaid in May 1906. At the first-named place a friendly interview was effected with Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his son-in- law Nasir bin Mubarak. At Doha and Wakra no members of the Bin Thani family were present. In the garrison town a call was made upon the Turkish Commandant of the port, who was urged to make an effort to capture the pirate Ahmad bin Salman. In Wakra a visit was paid to the house of the headman of the A1 bu'Ainain tribe, and the Resident's party also walked out to inspect the fort and wells outside the town. The inlet of Odaid was traversed in a steam boat for several miles, but no human being was sighted in the locality. The absence of Shaikh Abdallah bin Jasim was explained by his having led a small punitive expedition against the predatory Bani Hajir and Manasir tribes. In July Shaikh Abdallah led another expedition as far as Salwa, and his advance party attacked a settlement further north of Sufaira killing 12 Bedouins.POLITICAL EESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 69 On about tlie 22nd July 1906 in consequence of a newspaper report that tlie German Government was contemplating the requirement of Halul island, east of Katar, as a coaling station, Major Cox inspected the spot in the course of his journey back from India. In August Shaikh Abdallah was visited by the fugitive Chief of the A1 Morra tribe, who had suffered heavy punishment at the hands of the Ajman. In September the Ajman tribe patched up their blood-feud with the people of Doha, surrendering 100 camels and binding themselves to other engagements for the maintenance of the peace. In October the Bani Hajir Shaikh Salim bin Shafi came to a friendly settlement with Shaikh Jasim bin Thani to permit of his peacefully camping in the interior of Katar. In November an unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of Shaikh Abdallah bin Jasim by a negro slave. The latter was shot down after he had killed two persons, a man and a woman. HASA, KATIF AND THE ADJACENT TRIBAL TERRITORIES. The history of this tract for the year has consisted of a continuous series of disturbances, some of which very likely have been inspired by the agents of the Riadh Amir, Bin Sa'ud. In April, August and September caravans were surprised and looted by Bedouins on the roads leading to the Hasa Oasis. In August an important fight took place between the 'Ajman and A1 Morra tribes, when the Chief of the latter was taken prisoner and compelled to sue for his life under a heavy penalty. In the same month a fracas occurred between the townspeople of Mubarraz and an encampment of 'Ajman which was attended with the loss of several lives. In Nov ember a more serious fight occurred between the townspeople of Hofuf aided by the Turkish troops against the combined tribesmen. The garrison suffered about 20 casualties and temporarily lost a gun. On the 27th December 1906, a couple of small chartered steamers, the John 0. Scott and the Muhammadi, commenced pouring troops into Katif for the relief of the Hasa, Katif and Ojair garrisons. The presence of these additional forces was taken advantage of to overawe and temporarily pacify the Oasis and their environs. The somewhat disorganized former garrisons are now returning to Basra in driblets by the mail-steamers : so that the Turks do not appear to intend maintaining an increase of troops permanently in the district. The headman of Mubarraz, Sa'dun Pasha, and his son left home hastily in February to assure the Basra authorities of their innocence in connection with the disturbances. The Mutasarrif of Hasa has been Najib Pasha throughout the year. The Commander of the troops in Hasa, Hilmi Pasha, was relieved by Said Bey in February 1907. The Kaim-makam of Katif at the commencement of the year was Ahmad Effendi. This officer was replaced by Nasim Effendi in August, and the latter was succeeded by Ibrahim Effendi in December. The rule of Nasim Effendi was apparently unpalatable to Haji Mansur Pasha, the Manager of the Dayira Saniya, for the latter was able to procure the appoint ment of a Commission, composed of I'habit Effendi Bimbashi and Mahdi Effendi, both from Basra, and Owin Effendi from Hofuf, to enquire into the conduct of the Katif Treasury Officer, Darwish Effendi. The Qaimmakam and the Treasury Officer withdrew to Darin on Tarut Island during the sittings of the Commission, and were both afterwards superseded. The Customs farm of Hasa, Katif and Ojair was re-sold for the year commenc ing about the 1st March 1906 to the Bin Faris-bin Akhwan Syndicate for Rs. 16,000 Liras, giving an enhancement of 12*51 per cent, over the previous year's price. JUDICIAL. Two hundred and nineteen civil plaints and 206 criminal complaints were received and disposed of during the year under report*70 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULP The advantages of a preliminary meeting of the contesting parties in the Agency seem now to be fully appreciated, as is also the attendance of a representative of the Political Agent in disputes referred to the Kazis, which are incapable of friendly settlement.

Seven left the gency and probably returned voluntarily to their masters. Two Mekrani boys, p . a J 0 *™ kidnapped and enslaved in Minab, had their cases represented to the roliticai Kesident and eventually received manumission certificates from Bushire. In the case of the owner of one Negro, a most manifestly new importation trom Atnca, the Chief of Bahrain was recommended by the Political Agent to im- pose a fine of Rs. 500. The owner, an Arab of Muharraq, had also been proved to have acted cruelly towards two other slaves.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1908-1907. 71 The suggested fine was realized with the greatest promptitude—one might even say, with avidity. PIRACIES. The hardy annual, Ahmad bin Salman, made his reappearance early in July 1906 when he found two small Bahrain boats on the Dhaharan beach, the crews of which were collecting firewood. The pirate disabled one boat, and embarked in the other, a ' mashuwa,' taking its owner Sultan al Habaishi and its two khalasis to navigate the vessel. He was accompanied by about 10 Bani Hajir and Al Morra Bedouins. The party lay up in Dohat al Buraiqat for about a week, appa rently from stress of weather, as the Bedouins are said to have suffered much from sea-sickness as well as from hunger. They then moved on to Dohat ' Ain as Saih, and from there spied a boat which they failed to catch. In the course of the pur suit, however, they fell in, on the 14th July, with a Bahrain 4 boom ' which was taking passengers over to Katif. The latter carried only two guns, but the owners promptly exchanged shots with the pirates and had the good fortune to kill the most enterprising follower of Ahmad bin Salman, a member of the Al Braid section of the Al Morra, and to inflict a scalp-wound upon the pirate leader himself. The freebooters' ardour was thereby effectively quenched. They made straight for the mainland, buried their dead and dispersed, cursing their leader. Sultan Al Habaishi and his crew were allowed to sail their boat quietly back to Budaiya, their home. The pirate did not again put to sea this season, but he was heard of in the environs of Doha (Katar) about the middle of August, when he appealed to the hospitable instincts of one Khalid al Grhanam, a cousin of the Bin Thani Shaikhs, and remained in his house as a guest for a few days, leaving eventually with a pre sent of rice and money. With reference to the suspected case of piracy at Abu Dhaluf in Katar, men tioned in last year's report, every effort was made to get the Persian complainants to return to Bahrain and reply to the defendant's explanation of their conduct. The Political Agent's numerous summonses were however disregarded. It was therefore considered sufficient that the headman of Abu Dhaluf should be informed that the charge against his village was regarded as ' Not proven,' and that he should be cautioned as regards the future behaviour of his people. ARMS, SMUGGLING. There is unfortunately no doubt that the local regulations on the subject of the Prohibited Importation of Arms and Ammunition are flagrantly disregarded by a Syndicate in Muharraq, in which the Chief's eldest son is himself financially in terested, and there is reason to suppose that Shaikh Isa himself is not quite ignorant of what goes on in this connection. The first instance of smuggling came to light on the 17th September 1906 through a quarrel over remuneration arising between a Persian accomplice of the importer of the mail-steamer and a diver who was em ployed to find a case of rifles which had accidentally been dropped into the sea. The diver took his complaint; to the Chief, who promptly sent the disputing parties to the Political Agency for investigation, though the actual importer and his rifles got safely out of the harbour. In the light of after-events it seems probable that the Chief only took this action in fear lest the affair should reach the Political Agency's ears from some other source. The importer's accomplice was ostensibly fined Es. 150, but it is quite possible that the money was returned to him sub rosa. In November 1906 information was received officially from Bushire that the Director of the Persian Customs had discovered that a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition was being regularly smuggled from Bahrain into Persia.' Steps were therefore taken to have the baggage of passengers arriving by the mail-steamers from Maskat overhauled by representatives of the Shaikh and the Agency. On two occasions the Commander of H. M. S. Sphinx co-operated in this task, and it may be mentioned that Shaikh Esa received the Political Agent's first proposal for this action with evident distaste. The results, however, proved meagre, and only two cases of genuine smuggling were detected. In the first case, the Com mander of the Madura himself reported that four suspiciously heavy packages of flour were amongst his cargo, and on these being opened five Maskat Marti]li rite and 500 cartridges were obtained.72 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF In the second case a Baghdad pedlar was caught smuggling a Mauser rifle with 500 cartridges and 5,000 caps in a box which contained false bottom. In December 1906 Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co.'s native clerk was found guilty by the Joint Court of commissioning a public auctioneer to sell a Mauser rifle and a miniature ball and shot-gun in the Manama Bazar. He was fined R s . i 00 and both the weapons were confiscated. From the later confidential reports it seems that the traffic between Bahrain and the Persian coast is proceeding as merrily as ever. ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. The Political Agent was engaged in supervising the excavations of the sepul. chral Tumuli at 'Ali from the 1st October 1906 to the 31st March 1907. Seven large tombs and 25 small ones were opened at a cost of about Rs. 1 ,600 Human skeletons were discovered in every one, as well as large quantities of bones of animals of all sizes and descriptions, which had evidently been slaughtered sacrificially. A quantity of earthenware, both fragmentary and entire, a few pieces of wrought gold and copper, a fragment of an ivory image and some pieces of a marble plate form the meagre total of the finds. It is believed, however, that the lesser mounds may still furnish articles of interest, and it is hoped that further funds may be found available for the continuation of the work next winter. POLITICAL RESIDENT'S AND ADMIRAL'S VISITS. Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.B., accompanied His Excellency the Naval Commander- in-Chief Sir E. Poe to Bahrain on the 16th April 1906. The Chief of Bahrain, accoAipanied by the Political Agent, called on His Excellency on board the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. The Admiral and the Political Resident returned the Shaikh's visit the same afternoon at Muharraq, when a salute was duly accorded to His Excellency. The Commander-in-Chief rejoined his flag-ship H. M. S. Hermes at the outer anchorage the same evening, and left for Henjam, while Major Cox left shortly afterwards in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence for Bushire. The Political Resident returned to Bahrain on the 27th April 1906 and landed at the Agency. He left with the Political Agent for Katar on the 1st May. After visiting and landing at Lusail, Doha, Wakra and Odaid, Major Cox left the Lawrence at Sharga, and returned the Political Agent in that vessel to Bahrain, which was reached on the 8th May. On the 8th November 1906 Major Cox called at Bahrain, having Messrs. Somers Cocks, C.M.G., L. G. Eraser, C.I.E., and W. H. Shakespear on board. The customary visits were exchanged with the Shaikh on the following day. A Sanad conferring the title of Khan Sahib was publicly presented to the re tired Agency Munshi, Haji Abbas, and the Victoria Memorial Charitable Hospital was declared formally open. In the afternoon a visit was paid to the Tumuli at 'Ali. The Political Resident left for Koweit on the 10th November. NAVY. In consequence of the renewed activity of the pirate Ahmad bin Salman, Bahrain was favoured with the presence of a gun-boat for more than half the deep- sea pearling season. H. M. S. Lapwing came first on the 17th July 1906, but was soon relieved by H. M. S. Redbreast which finally left the neighbour hood of the islands on the 27th September 1906. In the course of this visit Lieutenant Commander Hose of the latter vessel made a cruise amongst the pearl-banks of Katar and Oman for the purpose of charticg the position of the more important banks. On the 16th November 1906 H. M. S. Sfhink visited the islands in con nection partly with the suspected smuggling of arms, and on the 26th November her Commander proceeded to survey the approaches to Katif from Bahrain. The vessel eventually returned to Bushire on the 3rd December 1906.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 73 MOVEMENTS OF THE POLITICAL AGENT. From the 3rd to 9tli April 1906 the Political Agent was in camp at Sakliir. On the 1st May he joined the Political Resident on board the R. 1. M. S, Lawrence on a trip to Katar, returning to Bahrain on the 8th idem. On the 1st June the Political Agent joined the Political Resident on a trip to India, visiting Simla, Bombay and Karachi on duty. He returned to Bahrain on the 26th July, receiving a visit of welcome from the Chief and his sons on the morning after landing. From October 1st, 1906, to 31st March, 1907, the Political Agent spent about two-fifths of his time in camp at 'Ali, supervising the excavation of the ancient Tumuli. For a few days in March the Political Agent stayed in camp at Safira, near Rufa, keeping the greater number of the infantry detachment there for change of air. VISITS OF OFFICIALS AND OTHER EUROPEANS. Mr. Garden, of Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., Bushire, visited Bahrain on the 30th April 1906 and left on the 3rd May 1906. The visit of Messrs. Stiirken and Wonckhaus in June has been referred to ante, as also have the visits of Dr. Listemann, German Consul in Bushire. M.M. Victor Rosenthal (Frenchman) and E. Duse (Italian) arrived in Bahrain on the 3rd August 1906 and left for Linga on the 12th October. They are believed to have purchased about Rs. 1,87,000 worth of pearls for the Parisian firm of Leonard Rosenthal et Freres and are said to have lost money over their transactions. Mr. Carmichael, of Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Bombay Managing Agents of the B. I. S. N. Co., visited Bahrain on the 18th August 1906. The Rev. J. H. T. Holman spent six days in Bahrain during September 1906. Major P. T. Westmorland, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, Quetta, spent a day in Bahrain in February 1907, as did Mr. G. A. Lloyd, Honorary Attache of the British Embassy at Constantinople in March. Messrs. J. H. Bill, 1st Assistant Resident, and E. V. Gabriel, C.V.O., Foreign Department, the Hon'ble Mr. Ramsay of the British Embassy at Constantinople, and Captain Williams, Residency Surgeon, visited Bahrain in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence on the 30th March 1907. The Rev. Dr. Dixie, C.M.S., from Quetta, arrived in Bahrain on a short visit to the American missionaries on the 31st March 1907. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Ca'ptaia, Political Agent, Bahrein, 7 F.74 ADMINISTRATION BEPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF CHAPTER X.—ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KOWEIT POLI- TICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. NEJD AFFAIRS. The year opened with a hollow truce concluded between Abdul Aziz bin Sa 'ud and Abdul Aziz bin Rashid. Almost immediately followed the news of the death of the latter chieftain, who, during the month of April, was surprised by Bin Sa'ud at night during a dust- storm and slain with many of his followers. Similar rumours culminated in a final report that peace between the two par ties had been proclaimed at Riadh, but Abdul Aziz bin Jalooi, a member of the Sa'ud family, was killed by Bin'Ijal, Shammari, while he was on his way to announce the news in Koweit. In the middle of August, Farik Sadik Pasha, with 800 Turkish soldiers, pass ed through Koweit on his way back to Irak About the 22nd of December, another large force of Turkish soldiers (800 men) passed the Political Agent's camp at Wara, near Koweit. This force represented the remains of the Turkish expedition to Nejd, as only a handful of men were left in Anaiza and Boraida. During January came the news of the murder of Meta'ab Bin Abdul Aziz Bin Rashid, his brother, Misha'al, and his cousin, Tallal. These acts were all commit ted by the order of Sultan Bin Hamud Bin Rashid, who made himself Amir. Sultan Bin Hamud is a man of about 40 years of age, and it has yet to be seen what figure he will cut in the politics of Central Arabia. As this report is being penned news arrives that he is gathering head in great force and that Bin Sa'ud cannot oppose him in the open field. The partizans of Bin Sa'ud, while they admit that the general position is as reported, declare that Bin Sa'ud will prevail in the end, for Bin Rashid's force is composed almost entirely of Bedouins, who will melt away, like snow, as the hot weather approaches. Hail cannot feed them, and Irak, whence the Shammar mostly draw their supplies, is 15 days away for caravans. TRIBAL POLITICS. Sultan ud Dowish, the Shaikh of the 'Elwa Umtair, died this year, and was succeeded by his son Faisal. Towards the end of February some Ajman raiders took away 20 herds of the Araibdar, i.e., the Arabs living in the desert immediately surrounding, and dependent on, Koweit town. Shaikh Mobarak at once took steps to revenge the outrage, and the Ajman would have been attacked by a ghazu in force, had they not submitted, promised restitution and surrendered one of their principal Shaikhs, Muhammad Bin Hithlain, who is now imprisoned by Shaikh Mobarak in Koweit. NAVY. In April His Excellency Sir Edmund Poe, K.C.V.O., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, visited the port. He was accompanied by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Shaikh Mobarak had come to the town on purpose to receive His Excellency, but, on the morning of His Excellency's arrival, the Shaikh, after writing a letter of apology and explanation, left for Jahra, taking with him hi son Fahad in a dying condition. In the absence of his father. Shaikh Jabir paid a visit to His Excellency and was received with the honours usually accorded to his father. The visit was returned the same day by the Officer Commanding H. M. S. Hermes.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1906-1907. 15 H. M. S. Sphinx visited Koweit twice and R. L M. S. Lawrence three times during the year under report. SURVEY. Survey work was resumed by the R. I. M. S. Investigator towards the end of September. The work was maintained throughout without any complaint until the 4th of November, when the Investigator left after finally completing the survey of the port. VISITS AND TOURS. The Political Resident visited Koweit twice during the year. During the winter, the Political Agent made two tours in the vicinity of Koweit. The first tour, which promised interesting results, was interrupted by the serious illness of Mrs. Knox, who was attacked by enteric fever. The camp, therefore, remained halted at Wara and no fresh ground was broken. The second tour was slightly more successful and the Banaya, 60 miles south of Koweit on the road to El-Ahsa, was reached. The camp then turned northwards and proceeded to Basra via Jahra, Sabiya, and Hogaija. No signs of Turkish encroachment were seen and the Political Agent was Well received everywhere and often hospitably entertained. These tours afforded a valuable opportunity of testing the Political Agent's new camel transport, which for this year at least may be confidently pronounced a success. The Political Agent visited the Political Resident twice at Bushire and His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basra once during the year. CUSTOMS. The administration of the Customs is still managed by the Shaikh's slave, ■ Oman. The working of the Customs seems to be satisfactory on the whole, as no complaints have reached the Political Agent. Signs are not wanting to show that Oman has achieved a considerable amount of independence, but he uses his power wisely. The relations between him and the local British Indian Agent are good, and as this tends to smooth working and to facilitate business, the fact is a matter for congratulation. While the working of the Customs is satisfactory, the rates levied have been increased and complaints have not been wanting on that score. An open walled enclosure for the storage of loose grain imported has been added to the already existing Customs house. In spite of the enhanced dues, the trade of the town has increased, and owing to the increased Customs dues and the trade, the revenues from this source have doubled. ARMS TRADE. The arms trade has flourished throughout the year. PUBLIC HEALTH. Two of Shaikh Mobarak's sons have died this year. The public health has, however, been good during the year. The dispensary was kept open for the benefit of the public and Assistant Surgeon Da'ud ur Rahman held charge of jfc throughout the period under report. MARINE. The British India steamers (fast and slow mails alternately) called weekly, but, on four occasions, the fast mail was compelled to proceed direct to Basra without touching at Koweit. The vessels of no other Company have made Koweit a port of PEARL FISHERIES. The Bahrein pearl fisheries were very successful; the take of shells was about the average, but the proportion of pearls was large and prices were good.. The Koweit share was put down at 20 lakhs of dollars.admn. eeport of the persian gulf political residency for 1906-1907, Eight hundred men from Koweit proceeded to the Ceylon pearl fisheries during the months of January and February. This year, for the first time, an attempt was made to regulate the numbers of the divers leaving the port. The arrangement was viewed at first with some suspicion by the Arabs, but the scheme was soon in working order, and the divers who have returned from Ceylon state that they have had a most successful season and that the Koweit divers were very well treated by the Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers. It appears certain that the pearlers' tickets will be eagerly sought after next year. SHAIKH MOBARAK. The Shaikh's relations with the Turkish officials have been friendly and he has given them valuable assistance in sending on the ragged remnants of the Nejd expeditionary force to their destination. On the occasion of Farik Sadik Pasha's visit, the Shaikh received him with his traditional hospitality. Frequent visits have been paid by the Shaikh to Shaikh Khazal, the ruler of Muhammerah. Shaikh Khalid ul 'Aon, the chief Arab resident of Zubair, paid Shaikh Mobarak a visit in the month of June. While the Shaikh's external relations have thus been satisfactory, his relations with his own people, in spite of increasing revenues and influence, have not improved. Both at the beginning and at the close of this year, forced levies of the inhabi- tants were raised for service against the Bedouins and for the collection of ' Zikat' from the desert tribes. These impressments were very unpopular, and on the last occasion, a good deal of property was commandered as well. Many complaints % were made also about enhanced Customs dues, especially on the subject of bazar sales and import and export duties by land. The Koweit 'Haj,' numbering 2,000 souls was, on its return, subjected to numerous exactions, both new and burdensome. But the measure which called forth the most unfavourable com- ments, was the levy of an extortionate building tax in the shape of ground-rent. For some years the Shaikh has been in the habit of granting land to applicants free of charge; the town has grown to four or five times its original size. In January last, the occupants of the buildings erected thereon were informed that they must pay 75 per cent, of the cost of their holdings, as estimated by the Shaikh's appraisers, when the property would remain their own, or that the Shaikh would pay them 25 per cent, and take possession of the buildngs. The Shaikh has purchased a new steam yacht this year at a cost of over a lakh of rupees and he frequently complains of his increased expenditure and his difficulty in balancing his budget. FOREIGNERS. No foreigner visited Koweit during the year. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SHAIKH AND THE POLITICAL AGENT. These have been cordial throughout the year, except at the commencement, when the Agent had cause to complain that his friendly visits were never returned by either the Shaikh or his eldest son, Shaikh Jabir, The difficulty was arranged satisfactorily.

There were no changes of personnel during the year among the officers in charge of Agencies, but Major Grey, Political Agent at Maskat, and Mr. George Grahame, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Shiraz, proceeded to Europe a few days after the close of the administrative year and were unable to compile their yearly narratives before leaving.

In the arena of higher politics the year 1907-08 has seen the development or conclusion of several important measures directly affecting our interests both in the Persian and Arab spheres of the Bushire Residency. The chief of these has been the conclusion on 31st August 1907 of the , n „ . Anglo-Russian Convention, adumbrated in Aoslo* iNUSbicLn (convention* % 1 • i • i c t last year s report, in which are enunciated the terms of an understanding arrived at between the two powers in regard to various points connected with their respective interests in Persia, Afghanistan and Tibet. That portion of the Convention relating to Persia opens with the declara tion that the two contracting powers have mutually engaged to respect the integ rity and independence of Persia; after which preamble Great Britain engages2 EE VIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN' THE PERSIAN GULP. neither to seek nor support on behalf of British subjects, or subjects of a third power, any commercial or political concessions north of a line starting from Kasr-i-Shirin and passing by way of and including Kermanshah, Ispahan, Yezd and Khakh, to the point of interjunction of the Persian, Russian and Afghan frontiers. Similarly Russia enters into a corresponding engagement in respect of a zone extending over South-Eastern Persia and the Perso-Afghan frontier by way of and including Gazik, Birjand and Kerman to Bunder Abbas. it follows that the central tract lying between these zones of interest, includ ing the Persian littoral and islands from Bunder Abbas to Mohammerah, becomes as it were a third zone of neutrality or disinterest ; common ground, in which the contracting parties claim for themselves no special privileges. Two further articles safeguard the customs and other revenues pledged by Persia as security for loans already made by the British and Russian Banks and provide for friendly consultation in the event of financial difficulties requiring the establishment of British or Russian control, respectively, over the sources of those revenues. Negotiations were concluded towards the end of the year for the assembly of a second International Conference at Assembly of Arms Conference at Brussels. Brussels, for the Special purpose of devis- ing means of checking the growing trade in contraband firearms within the zone covered by the Brussels Act of 1890. It is expected ^ that the question of the traffic in arms and munitions to and from Maskat, which has now reached such dangerous proportions, will, be brought within the scope of the Conference which is to assemble at the end of April 1908. Great Britain is to be officially represented by Sir William Lee-Warner, K.C.S.L, and Sir Richmond Ritchie, K.C.B., and two other officers. Major W. G. Grey, Political Agent at Maskat, and Captain W. S. Bowman, R.N., lately Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, have been deputed by the Government of India and Admiralty respectively so that their local knowledge may be at the disposal of the British delegates. The protracted negotiations connected with the interpretation and execu- Conclusion of the French Flag Negotiations at fio' o f * h e terms cf the Hague Award Maskat. in the French Flag case have at last been concluded, and all that now remains is the publication of a notification by the Sultan of Maskat informing his subjects of the results of the arbitration. His Highness is greatly to be congratulated on the removal of an element of local friction which has troubled the Maskat State for 20 years past. This prudential measure of policy has been proceeded with to the utmost Consolidation of our relations with the Ruler of during the year. Koweit. The above developments in the field of general politics seem collectively to have created a definite stage or vantage-point in the history of British relations with Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf, from which the ground covered of late years can be reviewed and the best course for British policy to pursue through the next stage can be conveniently scanned and determined. It can hardly be doubted that His Majesty's Government will use the juncture for this purpose. Since the conclusion of the Convention, Russian competition, commercial Rivalry of Foreign Powers. ^ political, has decidedly slackened. bome more water must necessarily How under the bridge before her local officials can purge their minds entirely of the Rll , sia&lt; leaven of bias and suspicion which .the character of our past' national relations had inevitably engendered, but there is no doubt that, whatever its ultimate results may be, the first effect of the Convention has been to clear the channel considerably and to place the intercourse between local representatives of the two powers on a more frank and healthy foundation.EEVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. 3 On the other hand activity on the part of Germany has been fully maintained. Apart from the Abu Musa Question which Germany. j s puj-gujng a somewhat deliberate course towards settlement no acuteissues or causes of friction have indeed arisen, but there has been a perceptible change in the general demeanour of the C erman Consulate at Bushire, since the return of Dr. Listemann from Tehran in Novem ber 1907, and the institution can no longer be regarded as the mere post ot observation which it had seemed to be in the past. At present however, except for some signs of an intention to create* rlifRrulties for us in connection with the administration of quarantine in the Persian Gulf Germany's activity in the sphere now dealt with can hardly be said to have ostensibly passed beyond the zone of legitimate commercial rivalry. In the latter direction the tours of two commercial delegates or experts Dr. Grothe in Kermanshah and the north-western provinces and Herr Kurt Jung m the south although sufficient time has not yet elapsed for any special results from their tours to have become apparent, deserve mention, as also does the fact of the lease bv Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company at an extravagant price of some river frontage at Mohammerah for the construction of a wharf for the storage of grain under export. , . , , , T To turn for a few moments to matters more parochial throughout the region Teivr of the Reports from Agencies in Southern dealt with, except perhaps the territories pJsta of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtivari Khans, the lamentable effect of a year's attempt at the constitutional government of the country by a parliament of crude nationalists, full of destruc tive enersv in their search for reform, but utterly wanting in the constructive ability necessary to effect it, is rendered only too apparent by the reports of our renresentatives. It will be seen that these reports are mainly a record of incessant chaos and uproar, and that the provincial capitals, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Kerman, have been unremittingly wracked by bitter strife between opposing factions. . In tbe case of Kermanshah the situation was aggravated by active rebellion against his sovereign on the part of Prmce Universal ci-^os. Salar -ed-Dowleh, during which our re- mesentative was called upon to play a most difficult part. In Shiraz again the discord culminated just before the end of the year in the murder of the Kowam- ul-Mulk the Pars notable, around whose person and family^ the disorders in ^hiraz of the last few years have mainly revolved ; while the situation in Kerman though her affairs have perhaps been less before the public than those of her sister capitals has been hardly less chaotic and difficult. Communications every where have been absolutely insecure and on the Bushire road alone no less than I c unexpiated postal robberies have been perpetrated within the last two years jand the number of them is steadily increasing. Apart from these general conditions of unrest and insecurity for trade, the ^ absence of effective government and the The incidents in the Gulf. activity of the f&lt; Young Persian' element have been responsible for two or three troublesome incidents in the Gulf ports, which have been not a little damaging to British prestige by reason of the length of time occupied in exacting any sort of satisfaction from the Central Govern ment These are dealt with in the Bushire report. Happily opportunities have not been denied us, on the other hand, of specifically asserting ourselves in a useful and more or less public manner, through the Naval service ; for example, by the capture in December of certain notorious pirates ; and again, at the end of the year by the extraction of an official apology from the Turkish represen tative at Katif for an affront previously offered to H. M, S. ' Lapwing' j and one can only hope that in the magnifying eye of the public these latter incidents will be carried with seme compensatory value to the credit side of the account. With reference to the allusion made above to Mohammerah and Bakhtiyari territories, it is interesting to note to what M,ohammej:ah and B.akhti}an country, ^ great extent the peculiar tribal and semi-independent status of the communities in question has rendered them immure trcm the direct effects of the national movement, which have been soREVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF. demoralising and disastrous around them. • In spite, of this fact however neith the Sheikhs nor the Khans have been free from an abiding anxiety as' to th probable future in store for them under a democratic government. They fear, and perhaps with good reason, that the first inclination of su h government, once firmly established, will be to exploit them and deprive them 1 their tribal privileges and the considerable measure of internal autonomy l they now enjoy. The presence of this fear has made the Sheikh of Mohamme 1 k and the Bakhtiyari Khans disposed both to sink their own chronic differences d make common cause, and also to endeavour to draw nearer to the British the hope of obtaining advice and renewed assurances of sympathy and snppo^ The Sheikh of Mohammerah moreover, apart from the anxiety above indi ed, became not a little alarmed towards the end of the year by ominous rumou of activity on the part of the military authorities at Baghdad, in connection w'th the Turco-Persian frontier dispute, and at an interview with the Resident January he begged that the attention of the British Government might be drar to the isolated and dangerous position which he, with a large extent of fromi? to guard, now occupied and to the persistent apathy with which the Persian Gov! ernment regarded the question. In reply he received assurances through Hi' Majesty's Legation which quieted his fears for the time and acutenes$ &amp; of the situation to which his alarm had been due, subsequently subsided. During the latter part of the year under report the attitude.of the Bakhtiyari on Syndicate. '? with the affairs of Messrs. Lynch Brothers and the D'Arcy Oil Syndicate has immensely improved. In the earlier months the operations of the Syndicate were so much hampered and their staff and workmen subjected to such constant risks and annoyances that it was feared that if the striking of oil in payable quantities were to be much longer delayed the Syndicate would throw up the sponge or their employes would decline to continue serving under such trying conditions. Thanks however to the interest taken in the enterprise by His Majesty's Government a special guard of Indian troops, consisting of 20 men and two British officers, was despatched in December 1907 to the scene for the protection of the camps and working parties, and for the rest the resolute perseverance of His Majesty's Vice-Consul and the unfailing support afforded him by His Majesty's Legation have at last made the Khans see the expediency of adopting a much more tractable attitude. As regards the prospects of the Syndicate it will be seen that up to the time of despatch of Captain Lorimer's report the outlook remained uniformly discouraging, but just afterwards the whole aspect of the operations was changed by the striking of a vigorous spring of good quality oil at the Maidan-i-Munaftun boring, and it is hoped that this strong fillip will encourage the plucky promoters of the enterprise to push it with renewed vigour. What the existence of a profitable petroleum industry near the Karun means to the future of Arabistan, needs no demonstration. This review would be incomplete without some reference to the all-important MeIcran&gt; question of the arms traffic from Maskat through Mekran, but the subject be ; ng fully dealt with in a separate memorandum needs but passing mention here, 'in spite of great expense in coal, and wear and tear of ships, and the utmost co operation of the ielegraph Department on the Persian shore, our efforts have failed to make any serious impression on the traffic, which is yearly increasing. At the present moment the results of the Brussels Conference now about to sit, are awaited before any fresh line of policy in regard thereto can be devised. While on the subject of the Mekran ports I may mention that in the winter of 1 907-1908 the Baluch Khans rose against the Belgian Customs Administration and expelled all their representatives from the Mekran ports and it was only after a long sojourn and much diplomacy on the part of the Derya Begi that they were persuaded or bribed to restore the control to the administration. Atone tune owing to the forcible levy of duty by these free-booter Mirs, from British subjects, the position on the Mekran Coast waxed somewhat delicate, as itREVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP. became a question either of conniving at the payment of duty by our traders, in the face of the protests of the Customs Administration to persons with no autho rity to take it, and thereby theoretically encouraging them in their defiance of the Persian Government, or, in the alternative, of possibly endangering the safety of the British telegraph stations and line by preventing our subjects from so paying. Fortunately the Derya Regi's efforts resulted in the temporary adjustment of the matter before it became acute. From the Arab side there is not much Reports from Arab region. £ or gpg^g] comment. At Maskat the chief events have been the conclusion of the French Flag negotiations, already alluded to : the Maskat ' wreck of the Hamburg-Amerika Line's Teutonia homeward bound, on the southern confines of Maskat territory and the subsequent escape of the crew and passengers to Maskat: the incidence of a new phase of the arms traffic, namely the smuggling of arms from Maskat by Somalis likely to become a question of some importance owing to the interest of the Italian Government in its suppression : and finally the loss by the Sultan of his chief official warrior Sheikh Suleiman bin Suweihm, who was treacherously murdered during the year. From the Trucial Coast except for the Shargah-Abu Musa question, dealt in the Bushire report, there has been Truciai Coast. nothing worthy of special record. At Bahrein the attitude of the Sheikh has much improved and the year has been politically quiet and uneventful, but Bahreln - the prosperity of the principality has suffered both from the slackness in the world's pearl market on which its pros- peritv greatly depends, and also from a severe outbreak of plague between April and July 1907 during which some 3,000 seizures and 2,000 deaths were repoited. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed the Bahrein exile at Bombay having completed 34 years out of the 5 years banishment to which he was sentenced, his petition for permission to return to Bahrein under adequate conditions was at the request of the Sheikh forwarded to Government with support, the state of Bahrein and the improved attitude of the ruling Sheikh seeming to make that course now unobjec- tionable. Sanction to his return was expected soon after the end of the year. Koweit affairs progressed satisfactorily throughout the year so far as our relations with the Sheikh are concerned Kowelt • and the latter although a self' .villed potent ate who requires treating with a great deal of care, has given renewed evidence of his conviction that his interests lie in close association with the British Govern- ment. The contraband traffic in arms to his port has unfortunately gone on sub rosa as usual but except as a part of the general question the traffic to Koweit is not endowed with such immediate importance to us at present as to necessitate specific treatment apart from our efforts to stop the traffic as a whole from the fquntain head at Maskat. The Sheikh has acquiesced at our instance in the institution of simple quarantine measures by our Assistant Surgeon in respect of vessels calling at Koweit, but it is to be feared that his atti- Quarantine. tu( j e j n re g ar( j i s no t a very honest one and may prove a source of difficulty to us in the future. In regard to the Gulf Quarantine Administration generally it will be seen from the Residency Surgeon's memorandum that the Home and Indian Govern ments have improved the service at considerable expense during the year in order to bring it up to date and to disarm as far as possible the hostile criticism of our regime which international jealousy so readily generates in this connection. f6 REVIEW BY THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP.

ADMINISTRATION EEPOET FOE BUSHIEE AND PARS FOR 1907-08. I $ As last year His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, now Com-visit of the modcre Sir George Warrender, Bart., O.V.O., C.B., A.-D.-C., in succession to commander-in- Vice-Admiral Sir Edmund Poe, K.C.V.O., made a tour in the Gulf in the Chief - flagship, H.M.S. Hyacinth, early in April. Owing, however, to the state of public feeling in Tehran, which was a good deal excited at the time in consequence of the increase of Kussian Consular Guards in Persia and rumours of Anglo-Russian intervention, it was thought that the visit of the Com mander-in-Chief to Bushire and Bunder Ahhas at this juncture might be mis interpreted, and His Excellency was, therefore, invited by His Majesty's Minister to omit Persian ports from his programme. He, however, visited Maskat, Basrah, Koweit and Bahrein, and the Resident, at His Excellency's kind invitation, joined him on the flagship for the visits to the two last named ports. It was noted in last year's report that the Derya Begi at the time of his changes among departure from Bushire had expressed the opinion that the swing of the :Persian 0ffieiala - pendulum would soon send him back again, and, as was expected, Haji Saeed- es-Sultaneh proved quite unequal to the task even of keeping Bushire in reasonable order, mucti less of governing the rest of his charge. His short tenure of office was chiefly remarkable for much inconvenience and trouble caused by his endeavour, believed to have been prompted by the receipt of substantial gratification from the Khan of Angali, to re-introduce the Shief, or harbour, route between Borasjoon and Bushire. In this, however, he was unsuccessful. He left on 20th January for Tehran and on his way to Shiraz nid Lirawi was robbed of all his baggage and horses and arrived in Shiraz in a very forlorn condition. His Excellency the Derya Begi returned in August and remained undisturbed in his post up to the end'of the year. _ There was also a change at the Karguzaret. The Mowagar-ed-Dowleh, an enlightened Shirazi with an European education, who had, though unwillingly, held the post of Poreigu Office Agent at Bushire for the previous four years, left in May for Shiraz, and was replaced temporarily by his brother, the Masood- es-Sultan, who remained throughout the year. Both the brothers were on cordial terms^ with the Residency and showed themselves reasonable to deal with as Persian officials go, but their utility to us was greatly discounted by the bitter hostility which existed between them and the Derya Begi, and their apparent desire that the Residency should share their feelings and place itself in opposition to His Excellency. Monsieur 'Waffelaert from Kermanshah changed places with Monsieur customs Heynssens just before the commencement of the year. During the former's AdminiBtration - previous tour of service in Bushire in 1904-1905 he had been a good deal in the hands of the Russian Consulate-General and had shown himself generally anta- gonistio to British interests, especially in connection with Quarantine and Postal arrangements Indeed his conscience was sufficiently guilty on this point to make him believe that his transfer to Kermanshah was due to action taken by the Residency in consequence of his attitude; and, after he left, he took several opportunities of conveying messages to the Resident to the effect that, if he were permitted to return to the Bushire appointment, the British authorities might rest assured of his friendly co-operation. On the present occasion, however, he only remained about six months, and left for Europe in September, the Central Government having refused to renew his contract. During his sojourn his personal attitude gave no cause for complaint. The working of the national movement and the attempt at parliamentary Government has, however, had a prejudicial effect upon the demeanour of the' g ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Belgian Customs Administration generally and our interests accordingly. Prom the first the attitude of the popular party was most hostile t Monsieur Naus and his Belgian staff, and, as time ^ent on, the position of tl 0 latter became gradually more difficult and precnrious. For instance, whereas local Directors had hitherto been allowed to employ Baghdadi, Clialdee and Armenian clerks, who served them better than Persians, they were now ordered to replace these, wherever possible, by Persians. Persians also began to be employed even in the higher grades. These men, necessarily recruited from the more or less educated section of the community upon which the preaching of nationalist propaganda has had most effect, showed a disposition to work against the European staff, and while, under the old regime, if they wanted a reasonably peaceful time the Belgian Directors found it profitable to cultivate either the Russians or ourselves, they now had rather to propitiate the parlia mentary element and the Persian vernacular press, which otherwise lost no opportunity of making things uncomfortable for them. They also had to put up with much annoyance from the Local Majlis and Anjumans, which, ignorant of their proper functions, hesitated not to interfere in all branches of executive Government. Another of their difficulties has lain in the fact that, owing to the great financial straits to which the Central Government has found itself reduced Customs Directors have, under the Constitution, continually been pressed to send more copious remittances to the capital, and, in order to meet such demands, have been obliged to have recourse to the strict application of many items of the Heglement which had before been allowed to become a dead letter or had been interpreted liberally on being proved unsuited to the difficult harbour conditions of the Gulf Ports. Thus it is that, though Belgian officials may have every personal wish to be friendly and to maintain cordial relations with members of the Residency, the conditions above explained have inevitably tended to upset the modus vivendi, born of mutual cbncession, which had been gradually achieved in our business relations, and to revive the friction which existed in the early days of the Tariff of 1903. At present the British trader has not only had to contend with every conceivable disability which the insecurity of the trade routes and the uncontrolled license of the so-called road guards can provide, but is being too frequently harassed at the ports by some oppressive decision or the revival or ^strict interpretation of one of the many catchpenny clauses in which the Eeglement abounds. The smuggling industry both in regard to arms and luxuries has continued to flourish, but there is some reason to think that the five Customs launches built for the Administration by the Government of India, though not used nearly as effectively as they might be, have done something towards reducing the volume of contraband traffic. I base this observation on the fact that the trade returns show a considerable increase in the quantity of tea legitimately imported tea being one of the chief articles habituallv smuggled into the country. Commerce. The arms that are introduced through the small ports under Bushire are at present all absorbed by the local Persian demand and do not find their way to destinations inconvenient to us. On his way to Shiraz by the now deserted Firozabad route the Resident learnt of several village depots in the hinterland for the distribution of arms, and the advantages or disadvantages of the latest patterns in vogue seemed to be almost the sole topic of interest among the peasants met with. insecurity of This subject is fully dealt with in the Shiraz report. The Firozahad road between lca ^ 10ns a mentioned, which a few years ago was regularly used, especially by Shiraz! 0 and camel caravans, as an alternative route between Bushire and Shiraz, especially at imes when the Kotals onthe main route were in bad condition on account o snow, or when fighting was going on among the headmen along the road, has quite fallen out of use owing to the insecuritv and absence of Governmenfe which has prevailed for the past three years.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY fO&amp; THE YEAS, 190M^0§. 9 Even with his sowar escort, the Resident travelling by this route experienced much annoyance; every man's hand seemed to be against his neighbour ; no one dared stay abroad after dark ; peasants who formerly kept transport animals for hire have sold them; ground has gone out of cultivation as there is no security for the gathering of the crop and the country generally is at the mercy of the most lawless element of the peasant population. The ordinary route md Kazeroon though not as a rule unsafe for Europeans was nevertheless insecure for posts and caravans throughout the year. So much so that from tjtme to time caravan traffic was brought to an absolute standstill. At one time six different posts were held up between Bushire and Shiraz and there was no letter communication between the two towns for five weeks. In fact during the past two years no less than 15 posts have been robbed between Bushire and Ispahan and as yet nothing has been recovered nor any compensation paid to parties who have suffered loss. Having regard to these conditions of chronic chaos which from time to time seem to have driven individual traders to desperation and even caused Messrs. D. Sassoon, in February 1908, to instruct their Agents to cease taking indents, it is an apparently paradoxical fact that during the year under review there has been no falling off in revenue at the Customs house at Bushire ! This may be due in some degree to the exercise of greater severity in the interpre tation of the Customs Ee^lement to which I have previously alluded and also to a heavy export of opium, but the real position cannot fail to become apparent from the figures of the coming year, during which there will surely be a tremendous falling off in the receipts. As it is, the back wash of orders sent home long ago is lying uncleared in the Customs, and no new indents are going forward. This question is a periodical source of dissension at Bushire, the two routes The choice of being controlled by rival Khans who are continually trying to wrest the lucra- Bushfr^and 611 tive privilege from each other's enjoyment. During the past year the question B orasjoon. has been the subject of continual wire-pulling among the interested parties, and much annoyance has resulted therefrom to traders engaged in the forward ing business. There can be no question as to which route is most advantage ous to commerce generally, but strong vested interests are brought to bear which never allow the question to rest on its merits for any length of time. In the case of the land route via Ahmedi, the forwarding agent concerned is able personally to supervise the despatch and receipt of his consignments and the caravan starts from or arrives at the merchant's door under his immediate supervision without any ' break of gauge ' en route. In the case of the Shief or harbour route, after delivery to the muleteer the goods have to be transported by boat a distance of 10 miles across the harbour by an entirely independent agency, and are then dumped upon the strand at Shief, where they often remain for weeks lying exposed to the ele^ ments while the muleteers carry them in driblets up the road. Sometimes a muleteer will contract, unknown to his individual clients, for the conveyance of two or three consignments at a time and having got the loads to Shief by boat he starts up the road with a modicum of each consignment and repeats this process until he accumulates all the loads at Kazemon, where be carries out the same procedure again between there and Shiraz. Not only is the Shief route open to this latter objection, but it is obvious that during transport across the harbour and detention at Shief there is nothing whatever to prevent bales being tapped and pilfered with impunity, it being impossible to fix the respon* sibility for shortages upon any particular agency. The result is that the Shief route is much more popular with the dishonest muleteer or unscrupulous forwarding agent while the Ahmedi route is clearly to the advantage of trade generally. Apart from this the two routes lie, as before mentioned, in the district of the rival Khans of Angali and Chahkuta, and every change of Governor means a renewal of bribery and corruption on the part of one or both.30 ADMINISTRATION ftEPOUT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY. As the Shief route can only be advocated for dishonest purposes or f r the fact that the Khan of the other route has become too rapacious, the Cent 0 ^ Government could, if they chose, settle the matter by making the Shief ro t illegal and by insisting on the Governor of Bushire regulating the levies f 6 fodder and water imposed by the Khan of Chahkuta, who controls the Ahme? route. This they will not do and when referred to invariably reply th f traders are at liberty to use which route they please. Such instructions afford no solution of the difficulty whatever and simply allow the question to remain a constant source of dissension and intrigue. As it is, for the last few year the energetic advocation of the Ahmedi route by the British forwarding aeent supported by the Residency leaves them for the time in possession of the Ahmedi route, but the difficulty is only prevented from assuming serious proportions by a periodical struggle with the local authorities. Rahdari and other illegal transit dues are still levied all over the countrv and will continue to be, as long as the Central Government is neither able nor willing to suppress them. Thanks to the energy which His Majesty's Vice-Consul devotes to this branch of his work, and to the co-operation experienced from the Mowagar-ed- Dowleh and his brother at the Karguzaret, the position of the mercantile com munity as regards the recovery of current claims is much improved. On the other hand, owing to the entire absence of effective Government at Tehran, it has not been possible to make any advance in the recovery of our old outstanding nor does it seem likely that they will ever be made good. The sailings of the Odessa Line have been continued in a half-hearted way during the year but their ships have brought very little cargo, and the Agent of the Line, Monsieur Mishtolt, recently admitted that he was doing practically no business at all. He is, in fact, about to leave for Europe owing to the stag nation, and does not expect that the Company will continue to maintain a European representative. It is indeed a matter tor some surpiise that they continue their sailings at all. The German Line on the other hand shows unabated energy, but according to our own commercial firms they are carrying on business on lines which cannot possibly pay unless heavily subsidised. Special reports regarding details of their operations have been drawn up in the Consulate-General during the year and the subject is fully dealt with by His Majesty's Vice-Consul in his Trade Report and only calls for passing reference here. Messrs. Wonckhaus continue to make Lingah their stronghold and the training ground for thejr European recruits, and there they have the field, such as it is, to themselves. In this conntction again our own nationalists aver that the Germans are trading on reckless principles, which they could only employ if they were guaranteed against loss by their Government. ration Syndicate. It is now . a year and a half since Mr. Hatinoglou left the Gulf for Europe, proposing to return in two or three months to renew his diving opera tions. Locally nothing has been heard of him or his Syndicate during the year under report, but it appears that in May 1907 the latter were seeking financial assistance in the London money market, and in this connection the Resident's views were asked as to whether it would be expedient that British capital should be encouraged to finance the enterprise. He replied that while no trust worthy information was forthcoming locally as to the commercial possibilities of the enterprise, he was of opinion, subject to that consideration, that it would be expedient to encourage British capital provided that the Syndicate would undertake to conform strictly to the policy which the British Govern ment have always pursued in these waters, of non-interference with the rights of Arab tribes to the pearl-fisheries. Since then nothing further has been heard of the Syndicate's proceedings. Oxidl^ohees 8 . 3, f qt J 11 re P^ to the representations mentioned in last year's report, the Sheikh siGn. oi onargah was informed that his action in resuming the concession appeared to Government to be justified and that he was therefore at liberty to take the necessary steps to make good the resumption. In the latter part of June 1907 eikh Sagar wrote to say that inspire of his warnings the concessionaire, iiassan Samaiyeh, had reinforced his miners and refused to stop his operations. Illegal levies. Settlement of claims. Operations of the Russian Odessa Line of Steamers. The Hamburg- Am erik a Line and German competition. Pponge Explo-AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 11 He continued that it was clear that an application of force would be necessary to effect eviction and that, as an inconvenient conflict might easily result in the process of it, he would be glad if Government would either effect the necessary themselves, the concessionaire being a British subject, or failing that would advise him how best to proceed. He was advised, as a necessary preliminary, to issue to Hassan Samaiyeh a formal notice calling upon him to remove himself and his workmen from the island within a stated time. This notice was duly served on Hassan at Lingah by the Sheikh's representative in the presence of the Residency Agent, who received instructions to inform the concessionaire simultaneously that the Sheikh's action appeared to the British Government to be justified, and that their support would be afforded to him should the concessionaire fail to comply with the terms of the notice; further, that on the expiry of 10 days from date a man-of-war would be sent to the island to ascertain whether the removal had actually taken place. Lieutenant 0. H. Gabriel, Assistant Eesident and Consul at Bunder Abbas, was deputed to stand by in H.M.S. Lapwing to see that the eviction was carried out without any contretemps. Hardly had H.M.S. Lapwing left the anchorage when Mr. Brown, the Lingah representative of Herr Wonckhaus, appeared off the island in a dhow flying the German flag, accompanied by Abdulla bin Hassan and some 25 followers, and attempted to land; but having been prevented with some resolution by the Sheikh of Shargah's guard, who appear to have fired some shots over the dhow when their shouts of warning were unheeded, the vessel returned forthwith to Lingah, and from thence Mr. Brown left by mail and laid a sensational complaint before the German Consul at Bushire. The latter forthwith proceeded to telegraph to his Minister in Tehran who in return addressed himself to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires. ISevertl eless, a few days later, on the 19th November, Dr. Listemann attempted to enter into direct communication with the Sheikh of Shargah and Sheikh Salim bin Sultan, sending them each by the hand of his Dragoman an official communication protesting at the Sheikh's proceedings, challenging his right to withdraw the concession, and threatening a heavy claim for damages if the concessionaires were not at once allowed to continue their operations. The Sheikhs fortunately refused to ^ive any reply to these missives (which they sent in original to Bushire) and were authorised to ignore them and shortly afterwards Dr. Listemann received instructions to address himself to the Resident. Notwithstanding that he had been three years in the Persian Gulf the German-Consul endeavoured to explain away his previous action by the statement that he was not at the time aware that the Sheikh of Shargah enjoyed British protection 1 In January 1908 a memorandum setting forth the German claim was received by His Majesty's Government and forwarded to Bushire for report. The main arguments in their case were :— (1) That the island of Abu Musa did not really belong to the Sheikh of Shargah at all but to his uncle Sheikh Salim bin Sultan ; that the latter had granted the concession in his own right and not on behalf of the Ruling Sheikh; and that Sheikh Sagar had no power to resume it. (2) That Messrs. Wonckhaus had acquired a specific interest in the concession and in the mines through the purchnsa of the share originally set apart for Sheikh Sagar, which had subsequently passed by purchase first to Yusuf bin Abdulla, and then to Hassan brn Samaiyeh. (3) That it was not true that the deal with Messrs. Wonckhaus had been carried out, as now asserted, Against the will of any of the concessionaires, who had in fact been kept fully informed of the transaction and had consented to its terms. Papers providing material for our rejoinder to the German arguments were submitted to Government in March. In regard to the salient points of their arguments above mentioned :— (1) Evidence from the Bushire records was furnished to prove that the island was the hereditary property of the Sheikhs of Shargah, and D29 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY indicating the basis of temporary enjoyment on which the islantf was tenanted by feheikh Salim. i lie letter himself, in a letter addressed to his nephew, altogether disclaimed ever having thought of asserting any title to occupy the island oq any other terms than those of sufferance on the part of the Euling Sheikh. (2) As to Messrs. Wonckhaus' claim to possess a share in the concession and mines, it was pointed out that his purchase of a share from Hassan Samaiyeh was, in the first place, invnlid on the face of it the transaction having been merely colourable and having taken place on a date in October 1907 long after the resumption of the concession by the Sheikh of S iargah; and, secondly, that the transfer of a share to a foreigner was in any case contrary to the spirit of the understanding on which the concession had been granted. (3) Documentary evidence was produced tending to prove the assertion that the transaction was carefully concealed from the other concessionaires. The above material was still under the consideration of Government at the close of the year. Meanwhile, pending settlement of the case, the Resident was directed to arrange with the Sheikh to permit Messrs. Wonckhaus to remove any portion they might wish of the oxide excavated prior to the inception of the present dispute. The necessary steps in tnis direction having been taken, the Hamburg-Amerika S.S. Louise was expected during the first week of -April for the purpose of removing as much as possible of the oxide lying on the beach ready for shipment (believed to be about 2,000 tons), and the First Assistant was deputed to proceed in the Lawrence to the island and stand by during the presence of the German ship, in order that no inconvenient incident or dispute might attend her operations. The local politics The observations made in last year's Report regarding the inception and ofBushire. progress of the Bushire branch of the National Parliament were hardly enthusiastic, but at that time the movement had not been long enough on foot to justify any confident forecast of the future that might be in store for it. The year that has since passed unfortunately affords siill less material for enthusiasm. The petty politics of Bushire have indeed been mainly too farcical to warrant detailed comment; suffice it to say that the intrigues to which the elections have given rise; the constant bickerings which have distinguished the meetings of the body ; and the scurrilous pamphleteering which has been so freely indulged in in connection therewith, have proved seriously detrimental to the general peace and prosperity of the port. At Lingah and Bunder Abbas the position has been much the same and though we are so far fortunate, in that party dissensions in the Gulf ports have never developed the serious and sanguinary proportions which have been witnessed in other cities of Persia, Kerman and Kerrnanshah for instance, yet the effect of the national movement up to the present has been thoroughly harmful and unsettling to the whole Persian community, and among the better class of merchants the greatest dissatisfaction is' openly expressed at the result, or want of result, of the first instalment of constitutional reform, of which such sanguine expectations were entertained. Indeed one of the principal Persian merchants of Bushire at a recent gathering of local greybeards feelingly remarked :— It is true that I heartily welcomed the advent of liberal government, but now I realise that it has so far been a failure and disappointment. In the first place it has brought into discredit myself and others of my class who tormerly enjoyed the esteem and respect of the whole community, so that under the present regime any low class rascal is at liberty to vilify or lampoon us with impunity. Secondly, although the parliamentary government has now been in progress for nearly two years its only practical result has been an aggravated state of general chaos and insecurity and the ruination of commerce. Jmy AND THE MA SKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR British interests have been adversely affected by the movemeat in Effect on British several ways. By the insecurity which has prevailed on the trade routes ; by mterests • the anti-foreign attitude of the local Anjumans and vernacular press; by the fact that the reduction of their emoluments and the meddling of the same two mischievous forces with their executive duties have undei mined the authority of the officials responsible for Government, and have obliged or encouraged them to be less conciliatory than heretofore in their dealings with us. It now seems impossible for a local Governor to assert his authority in any effective direction without bringing a hornet's nest about his ears. 'Whenever he attempts to do so, some individual with a private grudge or an axe to grind, or one of the petty Anjamans, at once despatches a missive to the National Parliament or inspires a scurrilous article against him in a local vernacular paper. The governing official in a few days receives a telegram from the Parliament or from the Central Government telling him to satisfy the parties and calling on him for exp 1 anations. The Derya Begi who, notwithstanding periodical depositions, never seems to remain absent from the Gulf stage for long and who in spite of national failings is undoubtedly the most conciliatory Governor we have had in recent years, has repeatedly expressed his exasperation of late at the humiliating position to which he has been reduced, and at the impossibility of exercising effective authority. In fact the grant of the privileges of a free press and the right of public meeting have resulted in the south in the generation of what may be termed a ' Young Persian Party, ' recruited from those of tne rising gmeration who have received some measure of education ; the class most stirred by the nationalist propaganda. With exaggerated notions of its own importance and of ' the glorious history of the Persian nation,' this element has devoted its energies to the formation of innumerable mushroom societies or ' Anjumans *' and the conduct of vernacular leat et newspapers wherein the doctrine of ^Persia for the Persian, ' has been enthusiastically preached to the ignorant peasant and petty trader. In the Persian Gulf it will be understood that the only palpable foreign influence with which the general public has been familiar in the past has been that of Great Britain, and the natural result is that-the brunt of all the preaching and pamphleteering falls upon ourselves. There is further Utile room for doubt that the proceedings of this Young Persian element have been encouraged both by German and by .Russian agents notwithstanding the entente, not so much at Bushire as at Lingah and Bunder Abbas. The two powers named have practically no subjects or protected persons to look after in the Gulf region, or anything but steamer borne trade and have therefore nothing to lose or fear from the spread of the new doctrine. On the other hand there are many questions with which we are directly identified locally which are necessarily unpopular with the native community as affecting the amenities of their daily life. Such as the strict enforcement of quarantine, the active suppression of slavery and the arms traffic; and the protection of inhabitants of the Arab principalities under our influence from Persian oppression or extortion. During the past year the energies of this nationalist element have especially been employed in putting pressure on local Governors to refuse to accept British intervention, as heretofore, on behalf of subjects of Bahrein and the Truciai Coast, and several troublesome incidents have occurred in consequence. Reports from Lingah especially have furnished cause for a good deal of Lingah Affairs, anxiety to the Residency during the year, chiefly in connection with the undermentioned subjects — (a) The hostility of a self-constituted Zabit of Kais island to British subjects, culminating in his firing on a dhow flying the British flag and having on board the Deputy of the Residency Agent at Lingah. (ft) The arbitrary arrest, despoliation and castigation of a Bahreini by the Deputy Governor and his refusal to admit the intervention of the British Agent. ,14 ADMINISTRATION' REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY (c) The anti-British attitude and intrigues of the Director~of~Cu^ a Persian named the Ala-es-Sultan, in association with 8 fh 18 ' kindred spirits. 0 er (d) The taking bast at the British Agency of about 70 Marzooki trib men from Hasina under Charek, owing to the oppression nf fi?' Sowlet-ul-Mulk, Deputy Governor of Bastek. The incidents arose as follows :— (a) As was mentioned incidentally in last year's report, the island of Kais is actually the property of the Kowam family who eniov it by a deed of gift from Nasr-ed-Din Shah conforriog possession without power of alienation; but, beyond placing it under tb revenue jurisdiction of the Sowet-ul-Mulk, Chief of Bastek through the Sheikh of the port of Charek, the Kowatn family seem to have taken no practical interest in it. The island is of no little interest to us however as containing a considerable community of British Indian traders engaged in the pearl and piecegoods trade. Hitherto the Residency Agent at Lingah in whose immediate sphere the island lies, has been able to promote the interests of our subjects through the friendly offices of tbe Sheikh of Charek; but in July 1907 the latter falling foul of his overlord, the Deputy Governor of Bastek, was thrown into prison, and during his incarceration a truculent petty Sheikh of the A1 A li tribe, having seized the fort which commands tbe island during the temporary absence of the titular incumbent proceeded to exercise functions of Government and to line bis pockets by practising all sorts of extortion upon the inhabitants, including British subjects, whose commu dcation with Lincah be then cut off in order to prevent their complaints reaching the Residency Agent. The latter however eventuallv heard what was going on and sent his brother with Sheikh Saleh of Charek who had now been released, to the island in a sailing boat flving the Britrsh flag, in order to visit the Hindu community and take steps for their welfare. Tne boat on approaching the island was fired upon from the beach by Sheikh Mahomed's tofangchis and having failed to effect a landing, was obliged to return to Charek, A day or two later the Sheikh, evidently becoming trightened at what he had done, proceeded to write to the Residency Agent, attempting to excuse his conduct by saying that the Deputy Governor of Bastek had dven'him'the strictest orders not to allow any vessel flying the British fla^ to approach the island; these orders were said to have been sent owing to the report given currency to by the anti-British clique m ingah that the visit of H.M.S. Lapwing whicli a few months before had attempted to survey a new shoal reported off tie island, was really an essay on the part of the British Government to seize it. Unfortunately at the time neither the Lawrence, nor a man-of-war was available to proceed to the spo an by the time the Resident had waited a fortnight for the ■Persepolts to start with the Derya Begi, he himself proceeding in the Lawrence, the errant Sheikh had escaped to the mainland. 11 J 18 , from the Mekran Ports, however, a few \ ee s a er His Excellency succeeded, by some mysterious means, in eifecnng Sheikh Mahomed's arrest at Khelatnear Charek, and e sen ence inflicted on him in communication with tbe Resident, of three months' imprisonment and Rs. £00 fine or ^ lee mom s more in default, was accepted as satisfactory, under all tbe circumstances. ^ In '!'? t SeCOnrl case a Bahreini named Ibrahim hu Khalil, who was T SOme de „ Dts to P ersons i Q Lingah, was seized hy the p y overnor Safor All Khan while on 4 visit to the port, \AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE '^EAR 190t-1908. bastinadoed and thrown into prison and deprived of a considerable sum of money which be carried, the precise amount of which was disputed. ^ The Deputy Governor absolutely refused to admit the Residency Agent's intervention or listen to his protests. Similarly a few days later some Arab passengers, bound foit their home at Shargah on board one of the Bombay Persian Company's steamers, having had some dispute among themselves, the Deputy Governor had them taken off the ship and exercised direct jurisdiction over them, again refusing the intervention of our Agent. At this time the Derya Begi was on the Mekran Coast on an urgent missson and no speedy retribution was therefore possible. On his return, however, he repudiated the action of his Deputy, and, while stating that he himself had specific instructions not to admit our intervention in behalf of Bahreinis in any form, he agreed to see that justice was done to Ibrahim bu Khalil and to remove his Deputy from Lingah on account of his general hostility to our interests. This he proceeded to do, and the case of the Bahreini was in a satis factory way of settlement in consultation with the Residency at the close of the year. His Majesty's Government finding the juncture inconvenient for ex-tcting satisfaction from the Central Government and a formal admission of our rights to protect natives of Bahrein, over which principality Persia still continues to formulate periodically fatuous claims of sovereignty, this local settlement with the Derya Begi was the most that could be effected. ^ It is obvious, however, that until His Majesty's Government are in a position to raise the general issue and see it to a conclusion, similar incidents, especially if the Parliamentary Government endures, will from time to time recur. (c) Both the above incidents may be traced to the evil influence in Lingah of one ALi-es-Sultan, ' a Young Persian,' pi .ced in the position of Director of Customs owing to the insistence of the Tehran Majlis on tne employment of Persians in the administra tion wherever possible. This individual came from the Caspian Customs with an evil reputation, which he speedily proceeded to justify, and though he (has since been y got rid of, a mischievous Anjuman which he established at -Lingah, composed of every anti-British element in the port, is still a source of no little inconvenience to us. Ala-es-Sultan began by altogether refusing to take cognizance of any document written in English, and by abusing every Persian in British employ who came near him. After the formation of his Anjuman on which he associated with himself the Russian Agent, Sadeed-es-Sultaneh, and one or two other ^kindred spirits, he^ used to use its meetings as a means for assailing British interests ; commenting, in his lectures, on all questions of current prominence with which we are connected, such as the Abu Musa dispute; the visit, of the Lapwng to Rais; the protection of Bahreinis, etc., and impressing on hi* ignorant hearers that Abu Musa and Bahrein were really Persian territory filched by the English, that the English had no right to protect anyone but Englishmen and jiatives of India, and so on ad nauseam. After repeated representations to His Majesty's Legation and by them to the Central authorities, .in Wliich we apparently had the full support of the Belgian Customs Administration, the Ala-es-Sultan was at last removed from his post and ordered to leave the Gulf, but not before he had done a great deal of harm. The hostile attitude of the Deputy Governor Safar Ali Khan is entirely traceable to his having fallen under the baneful influence of the Ala-es-Sultan, Sadeed-es- Sultaneh and their associates. (rf) In July 1907, the Sowlet-ul-Mulk, Deputy Governor of Bustekj visited the Shibkuh part of Moghoo to take in marriage theAfiMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY daughter of Sheikh Ahmed bin Eashid Merzooki of that place and to endeavour to reconcile the latter with his tribesmen with 'whom he had quarrelled. To this end he summoued the elders of the tribe, who, however, refused to attend. The Sowlet becoming exasperated at their refusal ordered ISheikh Saleh of Charek to expel them from his jurisdiction, and the latter having refused to do so was thrown into chains. The Marzookis thea sent a deputation to our Agent at Lingah begging that the Eesideney would assist them to get justice. The Resident, who was then at Shiraz, did his utmost with rhe Pars Governrnent but the Governor-General, the Nizam-es Suitaneh, was altogether unable to control the Sowlet-ul-Mulk; and as regards the im prisonment of Sheikh Saleh, His Excellency informed the Resident confidentially, and the Derya Begi told a similar story to our Agent at Lingah, that Sheikh Saleh had been arrested at the express orders of the Shah, on the grounds that he was believed to have been in league with the English to make over K.ais island to them! The Derya Begi having visited Lin^ah in November and failed to adjust the quarrel, the Marzookis took bast at the Agency. Meanwhile their families were expelled from Charek and built themselves temporary habita tions at the Lingah suburb of Jasha. The Marzooki elders still remained in bast at the end of the year. His Majesty's Legation having been unable to get the Central Government to take any seiious steps in the matter. In fact after the Correspondence had been going on six months the Derya Begi received instruc tions from Tehran to reassure ' Sheikh Saleh of Kharag and his tribesmen,' showing clearly that the Shah's Minis'ers had not yet realised that the scene &lt;&gt;f the dispute was the port of Charek south of Bushire and not the island of Kharag 80 miles to the north ! ^Humaidi' he • ^ 0 ^ em ^ er a family of Arabs known as the &lt;c 8ons of Humaidi,' pirate^of Dayir. himself a noted outlaw, residing on the Dashti Coast in the neighbourhood of the port of Dayir, pirated a Persian dhow at sea between Kais island and the mainland at Taona. They killed all the occupants exct pt one boy whom they threw overboard, thinking he was dead, seized the cargo valued at Es. 6,000 and scuttled the dhow. The wounded boy managed to reach the shore in a half dead eondit on and was eventually succoured by some residents of Taona who found him lying on the strand when passing from one hamlet to anoiher. As soon as he had sufficiently recover* d to m!»ke a statement he gave an account of the occurrence. It appeared that the dhow of these ' sons of Humaidi'' had been lying beside the pirated cihow in the dry dock at Lingah for some days, the pirates no doubt w atching what cargo was put into her. When the Shivoh vessel put to sea the pirate dhow followed soon afterwards and committed the piracy the same night. In January 1907 a Koweit boom ew from Basrah to Koweit with a number of well-to-do passengers, male and female, failed to reach its destination, A short time afterwards the boom appears to have stianded on the island of Amair on the Arab Coast, where she was salved by the inbabifan's. While reported to have borne no traces whatever of having encountered bad weather, and although h&lt; r ^ear w as intact, a corpse or skeleton Was found tied to her anchor cable, and the decks of the craft were covered With stains indicating that a bloody struggle had taken place. On being taken to Bahrein b.v the salvers for sale she was recognised by some Koweit visitors. Circumstantial evidence regarding the movements of the pirates about this time pointed to their having committed this outrage also and Sheikh jVlubarak was much excited when the news reached him. The Resident made represen tations on the subject to the 'Derya Begi and as they produced no result communicated with Bis Majesty's Minister and informed him of what had happened. ti i\AJ 0 c^ sarrie time the Senior Naval Officer was asked to take xa.M.S. Syhinx to Layir to nake enquiries as to the precise habitat of the gangjAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 17 but neither course bore fruit. Meanwhile the Shdkh ( f Koweit addressed the Eesid^ncy urging tbat, if the British authorities were not prepared to arrange for the extermination of this notorious family themselves, they should permit him to send out an armed dhow for the purpose, and generally for protection of Koweit craft at sea at the head of tlie Gulf. Tor several reasons GoTern- ment considered tl at this proposal jnust be negatived ; at the same time they held that it was incumbent upon th'm to see that other steps were taken to deal with the gang, and decided that tlie Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with our reasonable demands, His Majesty's Government would instruct their own ships to do the necessary. There being no result from this communication H.M.S Righfiyer, Captain C. H. Hickley, was sent up from Bombay at the end of November with orders to endeavour to capture the pirates at sea. In order to co-operate with the Naval authorities the Resident proceeded in H M.S. Sphivx to join Captain Hickley on the Highflyer at Henjam, and reliable informers having been obtained through the Residency Agent at Lingah, the latter was sent in a native boat to Da&gt;ir to obtain fresh information of the pirates' whereabouts and the services of persons who could recognise them if met with. It appeared from the Agent's enquiries, very skilfully carried out, that the pirates had just migrated with their families to the jurisdiction of Bunder Big north of Bushire, the Khan of which place, as a condition of their remaining, having taken a pledge from them that they would conduct themselves as peaceable members of the community. His concurrence secured the outlaws Ganawa as their place of abode, a hamlet 10 miles nerth of Bunder Big, where they had b( en seen a few days before by one of our informers. H.MS Highflyer and Sphinx thereupon proceeded to Bunder Rig. On the way thiiher Captain Hickley, Commander Litchfield and the Resident conferred as to the best line of action to be adopted. Owing to the waters off the coast in question being extremely shoal it v^as decided that the only chance of capturing the pirates was through the co-operation of the Khan of Bunder Kig, which could best be induced by a threat of the imme diate bombardment of his fort if he did not forthwith hand the pirates over or assist us in their capture. Bunder Rig being on the telegraph line it was anticipated that on our making any demand on him the Khan would attempt to gain time in order to telegraph tor instructions from Bushire, but the solemn threats of the Naval Commanders had the desired effect, and the Khan was sufficiently overawed to arrange witii Captain Hickley that he himself would ride off to Ganawa imme diately and endeavour to capture the brothers, and that if successful he would hoist a flag on the fortlet of the village, on which signal H.M.S. Highflyer and Sphi' X were to close upon Ganawa and land a party to take over ttie prisoners. The Khan being made to understand thoroughly that by co-operation he Would earn the good-will of the British auihorities while any duplicity on his part would be rewarded with immediate retribution, fortunately rose to the occasion and the plan succeeded admirably. Bis passage along the coast to Ganawa was watched with much interest from the ships in the offing and in due course a red flag appeared over the Ganawa fort. An hour or so later a landing was effected by an armed party from the ships including their Commanders and the Resident, and it was found that the Khan had succeeded in capturing two of the brothers, Abdulla, and Adhibi, alias Ibrahim. The third brother Abdul Reza had unfortunately not been in his house when the Khan and his men arrived and, hearing that two of his brothers had been arrested, had disappeared inland. As it was just getting dusk at the time he was able to get clear away. Their dhow, however, which was lying in the creek preparing for sea, was seized and taken to Bushire together with the pirates themselves. Having got the men it remained to be decided what was to be done with them. The Resident was strongly of opinion that if they were handed over to the Bnshire authorities for trial, there was great risk of their being allowed to escape, or of a failure of justice in the corrupt Persian tribunals, and as the sons of Humaidi were originally Muhaisin Arabs, and subjects of the Sheikh of Mobammerah, who had himself had one of the family in prison for some years and had expelled the others from his territory for piratical conduct in the28 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Shatt-el-Arab, permission was asked to hand his captire subjects over to him to be dealt with. Sanction to this course having been accorded, with the concur rence of the Persian Goyernment, the pirates were taken to Mohammerah in H.M.S. Sphinx. En route thither His Majesty's ship upon which the Resident travelled called at Koweit and the pirates were confronted with Sheikh Mubarak, who, as also his subjects, knew them well 3 they having lived for a time in Kow^it and having been expelled from there owing to their evil reputations. The Sheikh of Mohammerah who was fully familiar with their career of crime felt it impossible to resort to public execution for fear of arousing the hostility of the Muhaisin tribe, but expressed his intention of imprisoning them for life. There the matter ended. This gang of pirates was so well known all over the Gulf that their capture had a most beneficial effect upon public opinion, and the incident became the chief topic of conversa tion in the coffee shops of the Gulf ports lor some time afterwards. Quarantine and Captain T. S. B. Williams, Kesidency Surgeon, supplies the following note Health. on Quarantine Administration for the past year. Under existing conditions there are three separate sanitary authorities concerned with quarantine measures in the Gulf. These are— (1) 'Persian, —The Persian Government controls all sanitary matters of the Persian chores of the Gulf. There are sanitary stations at Mohammerah, Lingah, Bunder Abbas and Jask, with a large lazaret at Bushire. The medical officers who manage the Persian service are British, being lent to Persia by the Government of LaxHa. The staff consists of the Residency Surgeon, as Chief Quarantine Ofhcer, with an officer of the I.M.S. as Assistant, and six Assistant Surgeons. (2) British. —The sanitary authorities at Maskat, Bahrein and Koweit are practically British, as all sanitary matters are carried out by British officials under control of the Political Agents. (3) TurJcish. —The Turks have a large lazaret at Basrah in charge of two medical officers who are subordinate to the International Beard of Health in Constantinople. Epidemics, etc., during the year—JPlague. —On the 21st April 1907 a very severe epidemic of plague broke out at Bahrein resulting in about 2,000 deaths between the 21st April and the 5th June. As soon as the epidemic was declared, stringent measures were taken to limit the outbreak. Quarantine was enforced at all Gulf ports against Bahrein, and at Bahrein itself an inspection was made of all passengers before embarkation. On the first rumours of the outbreak, large numbers of the Persians inhabiting Bahrein fled carrying the pest with them. Portunately, with the exception of a few infected persons who landed at Dayir, all the remainder were caught at the various quarantine stations and detained. At the Bushire lazaret there were sixteen cases of plague among immigrants with nine deaths; at Lingah three cases with three deaths. The Governor of the Gulf ports co-operated heartily with the quarantine authorities' and no vessels coming from the Bahrein side were allowed to land passengers or cargo at intermediate ports without having first been to a quarantine station and received pratique. In the case of Dayir the Khan refused to obey the orders sent him, with the result that the epidemic gained some foot ng there. Measures were at once taken, however, to isolate Dayir and the disease did not spread. It was reported that two cases occurred at Basrah on the 2nd of June. There was, however, some doubt as to whether these were really plague. —There was no epidemic in the Gulf during the year, but danger threatened owing to the very severe outbreak in the Hedjaz during the pilgri mage of 1907-1908. It was decided that all ships leaving J eddah for the Persian Gulf sliould be dealt with according to Article 150, Paris Convention, 1903. further it was ordered that all &lt;c infected ' or 'suspected ' ships should first of all proceed to Bushire for the necessary disinfecting processes prior to being permitted to land pilgrims at the minor ports. Healthy ships not having had the provisions of Article 150 applied at Jeddab were counted as suspectedAND THE -MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR i907-l'95&amp;. ^9 ships. These measures were successful as nothing unusaal occurred on the return of the pilgrims. Statistics. —With the exception of Bushire^ returns are not available for this year which show the ships and passengers, etc.j dealt with by the sanitary- authorities in the Gulf. The figures for Bushire show that the saUitary authorities dealt with 4C9 vessels (steam and sail) containing 43,156 persons (passengers and crews). General. —During the year the Home and Indian Governments decided to strengthen the quarantine service of the Gulf. As a result Captain M. P. White, I.MS., was appointed Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer and an additional Assistant Surgeon was placed at Bushire. Steam pressure disinfecting stoves of the latest pattern have been ordered for Mohammerah, Lin^ah, Bander Abbas, Jask and Bahrein, while it is hoped that Maskat and Koweit will also shortly be provided with similar stoves. A Clayton apparatus for deratisation ' has also been ordered. When these various machines are in, place the equipment of the Gulf quarantine stations will be quite up to date. The actual buildings of the quarantine stations on the Persian side are still in a very bad condition. The Sanitary Council at Tehran are well aware of the condition of things and have promised to take up the matter as soon as the financial condition of the Persian Government shows signs of improvement, The hospital has been open the Whole twelve months under report. Eesideney Owing to the gradually increasing attendance the rooms hitherto occupied by llos P ita1 ' the dispensary in the Eesidency building having become too small for require ments, and the congregation of patients in the B^sidency court-yard a source of considerable inconvenience, the Government of India were pleased to sanc tion the renting of a capacious house next door to the town Residency and the hospital and dispensary were moved in. This arrangement is found to be a gre^t improvement in practice ss, apart from other enhanced facilities for doing Useful work, it enables the Residency Surgeon to co-operate with the Medical Officers of vessels of His Majesty's Navy and Indian Marine in harbour in urgent cases where examination or treatment on shore gives patients a better chance of speedy recovery. During the year ] 3,254 persons were treated as outdoor patients, while 139 have been received as in-patients. The statistics show that the largest daily attendance takes place in the height of the hot weather, i. e., June, July and August. In all 609 operations were performed, 69 major and 540 minon In addi^ tion to this 419 vaccinations were performed. There were no visitations of epidemic and the general health of the port remained satisfactory throughout the year. Thirty-five slaves recei ved manumission certificates from the Residency Manumission during the year, made up of 12 from British Bassidu, 19 from Shargah and 4 of slaves, from Bushire. The British Navy was represented by the flagship H.M.S. Hyacinth, the visits of Men- Highflyer, Froserpine, and the three subsidised vessels Sphinx, Jjapwing and of- War - Redbreast. The R. F. Surprise Was the only representative of foreign navies. She made the tour of the Gulf in the spring returning to her headquarters at Diego Suarez before the monsoon. Captain A. P. Trevor, on return from furlough to EUropej resumed the (Meiai change post of First Assistant relieving Mr. J. H. Bill, who was placed on special duty in the Foreisrn Department until near the close of the year when he was appointed to the Shiraz Consulate in relief of Mr, George Grahame, promoted to be Consul-General at Ispahan. Captain M. P, White, I.M.S., was appointed to the post of Mobile Assistant to the Residency Surgeon in the latter's capacity of Chief of the Sanitary Service on behalf of the Persian Government. After spending a short time at Bushire Captain W T hite was deputed to Bunder Abbas for duty.20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENC?

Rainfall and Harvest. The results of the meteorological observations recorded in the Hesidenc are appended hereto in tabular statements Nos. 1 and 2, ^ SHIRAZ (FAES). (Furnished by Mir J. H. B ill, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz.) The apprehensions expressed by Mr. Grahame last year were fully realised, the period under review presenting an almost continuous record of public commotion. In fact, the old theatrical direction ' Confused noise without ' is the most adequate expression to the effect produced on a student of Shiraz politics during this troubled year. The two main foci of disturbances were Qavam-ul-Mulk on the one side and the religious leaders, wearing a mask of constitutionalism, on the other. The incapacity of the local authorities to deal with the situation, so far as it was not due to natural inaptitude, was the result of the uncertainty in which all the operations of Government were involved by the divided control of Shah and Parliament. ittes? 1 autll0r ' The year opened with the appointment of Prince Moayyed-ed-Douleh as n „ , Governor-General. Be arrived on Anril Governor -GfDeral. _ ^,, . . j . , 15th, but never contrived to acquire any real control over the Shiraz situation. He was ill during the greater part of his period of office and departed almost unnoticed on June 13th. His successor, Nizam-es-Sultaneh, was a man of very different stamp. One of the most distinguished of present day Persians, with a reputation of firmness and capacity, he was expected to do great things, but his failure was scarcely less complete than that of his predecessor. This must be attributed in the main to the political uncertainty, which disarmed the executive, while the legislature was unfit to support the burden which it had assumed. Mzam-es-Sultaneh, after several abortive attempts to resign, finally left Shiraz on November 3rd, and strangely enough, the period of interregnum which followed during which such authority as existed was in the hands of Khabir-ed-Douleh, the local Telegraph. Master, was the part of the year which saw the establishment of a modus vivendi between the two hostile parties. The interregnum closed with the return to power, with the title of Sahib Ikhtiar, of the Vizir Makhsous, an amiable nonentity, much harassed by pecuniary embarrassments. He arrived on February 8th and rtmained till the end of the year, though the appointment of His Imperial Highness Zill-es- Sultan was notified on March i7th. Nebil-es-Sultaneh continued to display the same incapacity as Karguzar Kargnzar. which was described last year by Mr. Grahame, He was succeeded on December 12th, as a temporary measure, by Muvaqqar-ed-Douleh, late Karguzar of Bushire, whose intelligence and capacity are most unusual among Persian officials. Unfortunately he refused to accept the appointment permanently and was succeeded on the 13th of March by Moazed ud Douleh. The latter though hampered by ill-health and ignorance of the local conditions of Ears, to which he is a stranger, has given evidence of good-wi. 1 ! and a desire to do what he can to forward public business.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 21 Ata-ed-Douleh held this post uctil 1st September when he was succeeded ^ . by Beha-es-Sultaneh who remained with iieglerbegi. ' . . 10 „ , one interval of a few dnys until December the 3rd. No definite appointment appears to have been made until the arrivnl of Qutb-ed-Douleh, a Bamadani appointed by Sahib Ikhtiar on the 19th of March. As already indicated, the course of local politics was unusually tansrled Il0calp0litics ' and it is scarcely worth while to trace in full detail the course of the various street conflicts which in turn absorbed the interest of the people of Shiraz. The year opened, inauspiciously enough, with a telegram from the Tehran Assembly to Mirza Ibrahim, Mujtahid, denouncing all opponents of the Majlis as kafirs deserving of banishment. This was generally taken for an attack on the Qavam. The departure of the Shiraz deputies on April 20th w T as made the occasion for a great popular demonstration. Peeling being thus excited, it is a matter for surprise that the inevitable outbreak was pqstponed till May 3rd, when as the result of a trivial altercation some 300 supporters of the clerical party established themselves in the Persian Telegraph Office, and about 800 more in opposition in the Masjid-i-'Nou. Soulet-ed-Douleh, the Qashgai Chief, also entered the town with a large body of followers in support of the anti-Qavam party. This first stage of the disorders lasted, with complete dislocation of business, till May 23rd, when the Qavami's faction withdrew to a garden outside the town, and the popular demands were satisfied on June 9th by Qavam- ul-Mulk's departure for Tehran. The arrival of Nizam-es-Sultaneh was the signal for a laughable display of typical Shirazi cowardice, all the principal members of the local Assembly resigning their seats, but tacitly withdrawing their resignations on its becoming apparent that His Excellency would not be offended at this course. Disorder recommenced on August 27th, when the two parties again occupied their respective posts, the Telegraph Office and the Masjid-id-Nau. Brisk firing in the air was kept up for some days until the agitation ended paradoxically em ugh with the news of the murder of the Atabeg. buth parties being convinced that no attention would be paid in Tehran to their antics until the excitement caused by this grave event had subsided. This lull lasted in its turn until the fire was rekindled by the arrival of a new recruit for the popular cause in the person of one Syed Abdul Huseiu Lari, a disreputable Mulla from Lar, who entered the town with a large body of followers on October 13th. His coming had been advertised for some time, and it was not long before the peace was again disturbed. On this occasion both parties raced for the Telegraph Office, which the Qavamis managed to secure, the popular party retiring to the Shah Chiragh Mosque. On this occasion Motamid-ud-Divan, the evil genius of the Qavam's family, in whose service he had formerly been, came prominently to the front for the first time sirce his return from exile in July. Pighting continued steadily, uninterrupted by the arrival of the sons of the Kavam on November 8th or by the departure of the Qashgai Chief on November 9th, until January 7th, when a reconciliation was patched up. The most noteworthy incidents of this stage in the local strife were, the closing of the Indo-European Telegraph Department Town Office on 26th October 1907, in consequence of the entrance of several bullets, the entry of a bullet into Mr. Grahame's office on 26th November, and the firing of two shots at the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia on 10th December 1907. Peace lasted, in spite of the return of the fons et origo mali Qavam-ul- Mulk, until the murder of the latter on March 7th by a man who was said to be a servant of Motamid-ud-Divan. The town was instantly thrown into the wildest disorder and the Governor-General into the extremity of panic, being only dissuaded from resigning the situation to the sons of the Qavam by the repeated exertions of Mr. Grahame. The latter's task was rendered more difficult by the attempted murder of the elder of the two brothers, Salar-es- Sultan, when attending his father's obsequies. He was severely wounded in22 ADMINISTBATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY the lesr; and both these acts of violence being attributed to the direct instigation of Motainid-ud-Divan, it was with the greatest difficulty that Mr. r Grahame managed to satisfy the Qavainis by extracting from the governing nonentity a promise to keep Motnmid-ud-Divan in custody until a full enquiry had been held. Public sympathy, however, was soon diverted from the Qavamis to their victims, one of whom, Sayed Ahmad Dashtaki, who was accused of the attempt on^ Salar-es-Sultan, was not only killed on the spot, but his body burnt and his bones thrown into a well, an outrage on the blood of the prophet of which the Qavarnis were destined to hear a good deal more. The other victim, who was killed in the fighting on the same occasion bore an even more sacred character, being a Mujtabid of some repute, Sheikh Muhammad Baqir by name. The obsequies of the latter were the scene of a vigorous counter-demonstration. This, however, closed the scenes of actual violence in Shiraz for this year, the news of the appointment of His Imperial Highness Zil-es-Sultan arriving on the 19th March. Nomad tribes. y ear was a s tormy one for the Qashgais owing to contests for the office of Ilkhani. On May 1st, Soulet-ed-Douleh was superseded, by order of the Governor-General, by Asaf-ul- gai3 ' Sultaneh whom Mr. Grahame describes 'as a miserable, purblind abortion besotted with opium', and who, not unnaturally with these characteristics, did not succeed in imposing any authority upon the tribe. On the following day Soulet-ed-Douleh arrived at Shiraz with a number of followers and proclaimed himself an adherent of the popular party, to whose funds he contributed 800 tomans promising at the same time the support of 400 horsemen. On the 8th May a battle took place between the respective factions of Soulet-ed-Douleh and Zeigham.ed-Douleh near Bayza at which 20 men appear to have been killed. As a result of this Mirza Earajulla was deputed with 60 infantry to effect a reconciliation; this he duly accomplished and on the 2^th of May Soulet-ed-Douleh and his brother Zeigham-ed-Douleh came to terms, the former being recognised as Ilkhani and the latter receiving pecuniary compensation on condition that he should refrain from all interferences in tribal affairs. During June, Soulet- ed-Douleh distinguished himself by the assiduity with which he courted the new Governor-General while his tribesmen were busily occupied in laying waste all the country around Bayza. In October, Soulet-ed-D mleh received at Bayza a visit from Mirza Hussein Khan, son of Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who was accompanied by Motamid-ud-Divan. On the departure of Nizam-es-Sultaneli he reappeared in Shiraz politics remaining himself at Chenari Rahdar about 10 miles from Shiraz but assisting the popular party with a large body of tribesmen. At the same time the road to Kazeroon was rendered unsafe by the depredations of the Qashgais. On the 8th November Soulet-ed-Douleh finally withdrew from Shiraz politics for the year thus removing the most dangerous element. The history of the Arabs is more peaceful. Nasr-ed-Douleh ceased to be Arabs E&gt;ais-i-Arab on his departure to Tehran in May. He was succeeded by Amir Agha Khan, Mansour-es-Sultaneh, who was in his turn dismissed at the end of the same month. It being rumoured that the Goverror-General proposed to appoint Mutamid-ud-Divan to this post the Arab headmen promptly took hast in the office of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Dehbid whence they despatched a telegram of protest to Mr. Grahame, which was forwarded by him to the Governor-General. This proceeding had the desired effect, and Amir Agha Khan was reinstated in the position which he occupied until the close of the year, without however being able to prevent the tribe irom committing depredations on a large scale in the neighbourhood of Sivand. An expedition was projected by Mr. Grahame in September with a vfew Kuhgalll&gt; to increasing our knowledge of the country occupied by this tribe. He ban^ however, barely entered their territory when his camp was robbed on (successive nights, one horse, two rifles and some two hundred rounds ofAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 23 ammunition besides some of the Sowars' private property being carried off. These events led Mr. Graharne to cut short his tour and return to Shiraz. No fluctuations of special importance were noted during the year. The Commerce. imports are stated to have been about Import8 ' the average during the summer months and below during the winter although British piecegoods (the import of which during the last quarter of 1907 is estimated, at 5,000 bales) maintained their normal position. It may be noted that the import of Eussian piecegoods (chiefly cotton prints) during the same quarter is estimated at no more than 300 bales. It is generally admitted to have been a bad year for exports, general insecurity combining with low prices in Expo^ts ■ the foreign markets to .reduce sales. The only exception to the uniformly gloomy character of the reports occurs in the case of the export of opium during the last quarter of the year, which is stated to have been somewhat above the average of recent years, the selling price in Shiraz ranging from tomans 12 to tomans 13 per Shiraz maund. In connection with non-British trade it may be noted that Herr Burger (mentioned in Mr. Grahame's note for 1907) appointed Mr. Hai Malcolm, an Armenian under British protection, to push the sale of aniline dyes, while a competitor appeared in December 1907 in the person of Haji Mirza Husein, the French Consular Agent, who was appointed local representative of the Hoechster Farbwerke. A large proportion of the former firm's first consign ment is reported to have been refused by consignees as not up to sample and the trade in this article appears to have received a set back on this account. Herr Kurt Jung, 'Attache Commercial de I'Bmpire Allemande,' arrived at Shiraz from Bushire on February 22nd visit of Herr ung. rema i ne d un til the 28th. He visited the principal firms and Persian merchants, but it is noteworthy that in conversation with the Acting Karguzar he displayed complete ignorance of the fact that as above noted two firms of German exporters have now agents in Sliraz for the sale of aniline dy&lt; s. His purchases were apparently confined to saddle bags and carpets. In conversation with Mr. Roevsr, a partner in the only firm of Germans resident in Sliiraz, he expressed his concurrence in the latter's pessimistic estimate of the commercial situation in Fars, and lamented that he should be called on to write in an optimistic vein on this subject. In fact his visit appears to have little significance except as evidence of the attention now being paid by the German Government to Persian commerce. The grain, crops in the immediate vicinity of Shiraz appear to have been Agriculture, good, but the outlying districts suffered from rust and Qashgais, while in the more low-lying portions of the province the crop was an almost complete failure owing to lack of rain. The opium crop was injured by hail in April, jjitlci and was below the average. In view of the almost complete impotence of the Provincial authorities Public security. If ^ on the outlying parts of the Province, it is perhaps more surprising that the roads should have been open at all, than that a continual series of road : ftf robberies should have been reported throughout the year. On the Bushire road, the principal causes of trouble were the state of *0 chaos to which the town of Kazeroon was reduced by intestine feuds and the absence of all authority, and the standing quarrel between Hyder Khan of Kamarij and Nur Muhammad Khan of Daliki, each of whom had his candidate for the post of Kadkhuda of Konartakhteh, a village situated on the road itself. The nominal Deputy Governor of Kazeroon was Haji Zergham-ush- Sharieh, son of the Imam Juma of Shiraz, who owns extensive properties in that, part of the province, but such authority as existed was in the hands of jl^ 1 Khwaja Ibrahim, one of the notables of the town, who used his powers for the . jC 1 ■extermination of his numerous private enemies. This naturally led to frequent fighting in and around the town. j The feud between Kamarij and DaliH was quiescent during 1907, but in o# January 1908 a miniature civil war broke out, the plain of Konartakhteh2^ ADMINISTEATION REPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY being the scene of numerous and unusually bloody skirmishes. As no post from the south reached Shiraz from January 17th to February 19^^ On the Isfahan road, the principal offender was Asghar Khan Arah infested the Mervdasht plain all summer. ' w ' 0 Under these circumstances, robberies were naturally numerous commonly went unpunished. The Perskn post was looted four times d the Residency kasid twice. The principal robberies from British suh* ^ were:—the robbery of a horse and two rifles with cartridges f Mr. Grahame's camp by Bawi tribesmen ; notes for tomans 2,235 f the pro ^ of the Imperial Bank, stolen by a Qashgai from the Political Hesi/ 61 ? caravan; a rifle stolen on the Kotal-i-Mallou from a sowar of the re 1 I Tehran escort; opium to the value of tomans 3,144, the property of Messrs a road r Zeigler and Messrs. Dixon, stolen near Shulgistan on the Isfahan ro d silver bars and private effects to the value of tomans 3,000 stolen near Che Hahdar, apparently by Ba^iri Arabs; piece goods to the value of tomans the property of Messrs.

This gentleman was stopped about a quarter of an hour's walk from the Kazeroon Gate of the town by four men believed to have been Qashgais, robbed, beaten, and finally stripped. Taken m conjunction with this incident, the various robberies detailed above, in which the property stolen belonged to His Maiestv's Government, tend to shew that that divinity which did hedee a European and especially the property of a European Government, has to a great extent vanished, and the impunity enjoyed without exception by all the peroetratom has not tended to restore it. r ^ ^ a p ha.

Their on I v troubles occurred m the spring of 1908, and arose out of the disputed ownership of the house rented hythera, which eventually became so acute, that to protect them from insult, Mr. Grahame was forced to transfer the Clifton family to the Eesidency, and occupy their house himself with the Residency sowars. During the year, 15 letters of manumission were granted. All the slaves but one were sent away after release to destinations selected by them.

ADMINISTRATION REPOET OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S VICE- CONSULATE, ARABISTAN, AHWAZ, FOR THE YEAR 1907- 1908. Ahwaz. M atters V ice -C onsulate. 1. Slaff. —Captain 'D. L. R. Lorimer, I.A., retained charge of the Vice- Consulate throughout the year. The Indian escort of 12 sowars after the completion of its term of three years was relieved in the middle of December. At the same time, for reasons which will be explained, the strength of the escort was increased by two British officers and 20 rifles (8 sowars and 12 infantry). This contingent arrived under the charge of Lieutenant 'Wilson, I.A., who was shortly after wards joined by Lieutenant Ranking, I.A. Also in December the Hospital Assistant, who had held charge since January 1906, was replaced by another and allowed to return to India. 2. Tours. —The usual hot weather tour of the Vice -Consul occupied from May 10th to October 24th, and in July he visited the Legation at Tehran on special summons. This tour also included two visits to Shushter and one to Dizfnl, and a journey among the Surkba and A1 Kathir Arabs, living between the Diz and Karkha rivers. A further tour was made in the Bakhtiari Garmsir, which occupied from January 2nd to February 4th, in the course of which Mamatain and Maidan Munaftun were visited. 3. Medical, —The dispensary was maintained throughout the year at Ahwaz. The daily average attendance for the months April to November was 44 , 22, which rose to 84r78 for the period December to March, which succeeded the appointment of the new Hospital Assistant Medical relief is sought not only by the local inhabitants, but also by the Bedouin Arabs of the District and the people of Shushter and Dizful. 4. Building of a Vice'Consulate. —This project formed the subject of negotiation between His Britannic Majesty's Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Sheikh Khaza'l, but has not been dealt with from Ahwaz. It is understood that an agreement satisfactory to both parties is within sight. Mr. Laffere, the Assistant Engineer in the Persian Gulf, visited Ahwaz in the beginning of February for the purpose of inspecting the site and making enquiries relative to building material. 5. Housing. —At the commencement of the year, the escort had to vacate their quarters, and owing to the excessive graspingness of the Nasiri people it was not found possible to obtain new quarters until November. At the beginning of the year quarters were also leased for the dispensary. Hospital Assistant and Head Clerk, not without considerable difficulty. Southern Arabistan. 6. Sheikh Khaza'l, Sardar Arfa, retained his position as overlord of the tribes and titular Persian Governor, and he continued to enjoy the services of his righthand man Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, who in spite of increasing age and physical attenuation continues to display his habitual marvellous mental and physical activity. At Nasiri Haji Sheikh Rahama continued to act as Deputy Governor until May, when he gave place again to his brother Sheikh Hanzal, who returned at that time from Behbahan.30 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCE Sheikh Eahma's regime was not at all a success, and he failed to give satisfaction to the people of the town, to Shekh Khaza'l, or to this Vice- Consulate. The relations between Sheikh Hanzal and the Vice-Consulate since hia return to office have been very satisfactory. 7. The perennial question of the Beni Turuf did not fail to arise, Iti 3 stated that this year the trouble was not as usual due to the unwillingness of the Beni Turuf to pay revenue to Sheikh Khaza'l, but to the latter having placed the control of certain irrigation rights in the hands of a certain indivi- dual, which did not meet with approval of Haji Sabhan and others. A large force, variously over-estimated, was collected, and left from Muzaffariya under the leadership of Sheikh Hanzal on the 10th of June. The official Chiefs, Ali Mnaishid and Zahar Ali, remained loyal and the operations were directed against Haji Sabhan. ^ Abortive negotiations were followed by fighting in which Sheikh Hanzal is said to have lost an aggregate of 150 men and the Beni Turuf twice that number. The Beni Turuf resistance was entirely broken down and the Sheikh 's forces entered Hawiza with flying colours. Sabhan took refuge in the first place with the Khasrij, the latter, however : seeing nothing to be gained eventually refused him a permanent asylum and he then made his way over into Turkish territory where he has since remained Ali Mnaishid and Zahar Ali were confirmed in their headship of the tribe. Sheikh Hanzal returned to Nasiri on the 11th July, and Sheikh Khaza 'l went down to Muhammerah on the 12th. 8. Save for this campaign the province has enjoyed peace throughout the year. A minor fracas only occurred in the beginning of December af Eaghaiwa, and it was at first anticipated that the Baghaiwa question might arise between the Sheikh and the Bakhtiari Khans in an acute form. It proved, however, that the disturbance had merely occurred between certain Arabs under the Sheikh's jurisdiction and others under that of the Khans, ami the matter was arranged diplomatically on the spot by Agents deputed by the Khans and the Sheikh. * 1 9. This result was facilitated by a growing desire on the part of both the Sheikh and the majority.of. the Khans to set their mutual relations on a more friendly and a more secure footing. Some degree of cordiality tempered by misunderstandings has existed for a considerable time between the Sheikh and the family of the late Hussain Quli Khan, Ilkhani, always excluding the Sarasam-us-Sultanah, but it was not till the spring of 1907 that the Shahab-us- Sultanah representing the rival family, under the pressure of domestic difficul ties evinced any desire to establish an entente with the Sheikh. From whortf- ever the initiative may have come, a friendly understanding was quickly established. The subsequent speedy collapse of the Shahab and the restoration to power of the Samsam, the sworn enemy of the Sheikh, somewhat complicated the situation for the latier, but after the test of time it would appear that the Sheikh has been able to maintain his understanding with the Shahab without prejudicing his relations with the other family, again always excepting the Samsam, and that consequently a distinct advance in policy has been made. The value of these understandings should not be over-estimated, but they have the effect of facilitating the amicable discussion of difficulties when, as often, neither party is in reality anxious to push matters to extremes. Since July the nominal concord, which has subsisted between the two^ parties of the Khans, has been to the advantage of the Sheikh, or of any one else who has had to deal with them. i-u ^keikh drew one immediate advantage from the understanding with the khahab m being able to indent on him for Deputy Governors for Shushter ana Dizful when he took over the administration of Northern Arabistan fropi the Sardar Mukarram.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 81 10. During the last two months the Khans have repeatedly declared their intention of coming down to meet the Sheikh in his own territory, but tip to the .end of March they had not made good their words. That such a matter should have come nnder contemplation is in itself something, and appears significant of a considerable shifting of their habitual point of view. Formerly only junior Khans, such as Ynsuf Khan, have visited the Sheikh, and that only in the capacity of subordinate Agents. 11. Whether owing to merely external circumstances or not, the relations of the Sheikh with Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit have come into greater promi nence than previously. The visit of Sheikh Mubarak to Eailiya in conm ction with the marriage of Chasib, Sheikh KhazaTs son, occurred before thebeoinning of the period now under review, but only slightly so, and the visit was repeated during the course of the Beni Turuf campaign. Sheikh Mubarak is reported to have proffered his active assistance in that campaign, whieh was, it is said, declined. Hut the attention of the Tehran Majlis was attracted and a question was asked in that assembly as to the relations of the two Sheikhs and the presence of Mubarak, an alien, in Persian territory. There is always an inherent readiness in the Persian mind to believe in Sheikh KhazaTs desire to emancipate himself from the sovereignty of Persia, though he has done nothing to justify such an inference, and is probably not particularly anxious to accept the anxieties of independence were they placed within his immediate reach. 12. The Turhs. Tho antagonism between Persia and Turkev which, if not actually caused by the border question at Urumia, has at least been clearly brought to a focus m that region, has latterly begun to bear fruit in the minds of the people of South-W^est Persia. It is difficult to give dates, but already in the beginning of the last cold weather there were rumours of designs of aggres sion harboured by the Turks, and it was asserted that they intended to foster unrest among the tribes on their border with a view to precipitating an invasion into the Hawiza district. These rumours, stimulated apparently by actual signs of military activity at Basrah and Baghdad eventually developed m March into circumstantial accounts of orders received by the Sheikh from Tehran to attack and seize Basrah, and of musterings of his followers com manded by him with that object. No breach of the international peace in this quarter has, however, as vet occurred. J It is generally asserted by the Arabs here that the Arab subjects of the Sultan in the neig-hbourhood of Basrah would be only too willing to fall under the rule of the Sheikh. The Sheikh moreover has very extensive landed property on the south of the Shat-el-Arab, and his tenants on Turkish soil amount, on the authority of Sheikh Hanzal, to 30,000 (men or souls ?). An outbreak of hostilities in this region may be regarded as a very remote contingency, but were it to occur the initial advantage would lie with the Persians, which it would not, it may be presumed, in the north where the Turks are exerting pressure. 13. Before quitting the subject of the external affairs of Southern Arabistan, it should be remarked that the Sheikh, tiring of his endeavours to secure the effective co-operation of the Bakhtiari Khans in the Government of Behbahan District, threw up his part in that Government, and withdrew Sheikh Hanzal, who had been representing him at Behbahan. Sheikh Hanzal's return took place in May, but the formal renouncement of the Government bv the Sheikh was of a later date. • 14s ' ■British 4 fairs.—The principal question relating to British interests in Southern Arabistan, during the period now under consideration, was in connection with the purchase and sale of wheat. The harvest of 1907 was a bumper one, and the exports of grain, com mencing m August, were large. Export was still in full swing in November, when m favourable seasons the first winter rains are looked for. The early rams are not essential to good crops in the following year as sowing may take place any time before the end of January.32 'ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The Sheikb, however, chose to maintain that the prospects of the 1908 crop were ruined, and issued orders to the tribes to at once cease selling grain. Simultaneously measures were taken to prevent the brokers who are employed bv all buyers from s^oing out among the tribes or from purchasing, and among others Messrs Lynch Brothers found their brokers put under restraint. All this occurred without anv notice being given to Messrs. Lynch Brothers or to this Vice-Consulate, and Sheikh Hanznl when questioned as to the measures he was taking under the Sheikh's instructions was unable to quote any ovfov officially, but he did privately show a letter on the subject from Sheikh Khaza'l, which fully covered him. In Arkbistan unfortunately, as in Mesopotamia, it is impossible to buy produce from the Arabs without making large cash advances. Lvnch having their advances to the Arabs as well as to transport Agents imperilled, were forced to bring the Sheikh's action into question. Keference was accordingly made to him by this Vice-Consulate, and a lengthy and evasive answer was received, representing that the Arabs had become alarmed and themselves urged that this prohibition should be introduced and tnatthe Sheikh, if he had done anvthing, had merely tacitly acquiesced in the unanimous desire of the people, which was of course untrue, also that restrictions were merely a matter of domestic economy, and had no kinship with formal embargoes imposed by the Central Government. Further the proposal was put forward that the exporters should resume their business under written engagements that they would in case of necessity re-import a similar quantity of grain to that which they should export, and place it on the market at the same price as that at which the latter had been purchased. In the meantime reference made earlier to His^ Majesty's Legation was bearing fruit, and a telegram was received by His Majesty's Consul at Muham- merah from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, desiring him to inform the Sheikh that restrictions put on the freedom of trade being opposed to our Treaty rights with Persia would not be tolerated. Shortly afterwards the restrictions were removed. It has only been possible to treat this matter here in outline, and information regarding many points not mentioned must be sought in the original correspondence. The scheme is probably to be credited to Haji Rais, and it is possible that he succeeded in misleading the Sheikh, for whose good faith in the matter a fair case might then be made out. But it is impossible to entirely explain away the failure to give warning and the underhand way in which the measures were put in force. It may be noted that though eventually the rains failed and the crops in Southern Arabistan in the ensuing year will be a negligible quantity, no move has been made towards the imposition of a properly authorised embargo. ]5. MuhammeraJi. — It is sufficient here to note that during the past year Sheikh Ktiaza'l installed his son. Sheikh Chasib, as Deputy Governor at Muhammerah in place of his foimer Agent 'Abdi. Chasib has as ' Wazir ' a young Persian, Abdul Majid, who has spent some time in England and of whom it is difficult to say much good beyond that he is intelligent. The new regime has been interesting itself in sanitation and other foreign ideas. Sheikh Khaza'l has also been occupied in ( xtendine: the town, and has lately taken in hand the construction of a canal between the Shat-el.Arab and the Karun. 16. According to report a proposal was made in winter by the Tehran Majlis for the institution of a local Majlis at Muhammerah for which it was proposed to depute suitable members. After some passages of diplomatic arms the Sheikh was left in possession of the field. 17., Nasiri —The town continued to extend at the accelerated rate which besan in 1^06, but it is questionable whether the population has increased pari passu with the increased accommodation available for it. The rumour received from time to lime of the establishment of a local Majlis at Muhammerah excited the ambitious of two or three knavish, and sw* disant enlightened, members of Nasiri society, and they began to talk openly of the desirability of setting up a public assembly in the town.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1907-1908. 33 This ^popular ' movement was brutally quelled by threatening the more active with expulsion from the town mounted backwards on donkeys. Demo cratic zeal was unable to face this ordeal, and the Postmaster still busies his talents in the task of increasing the deficit in the Post Office cash box. 18. In January a change took place in the Customs Office, when the local Director, Mr. H. Glover, who had held the post for a number of years, was transferred to Mohammerah, and Sheikh Abdul Bussain was transferred from the Shushter Office to take his place. Sheikh Abdul Hassain is friendly to Europeans. He at one time in his career spent 14 years in Burma, and became a naturalised British Indian subject. He has since his appointment given entire satisfaction to the European part of the community. Northern Arabistan. 19. In April the Governorship of Luristan was conferred on Sardar Mukarram to be held conjointly with that of Arabistan. The Sardar has spent some four months in the company of Sheikh Khaza'l, and a strong friendship, probably to some extent genuine, was established between them. On May 2nd he eventually left JSasiri for Dizful with the declared intention of proceeding to Kurramabad by way of Luristan. It will be seen elsewhere that he was unduly sanguine in his designs, and that he had to retrace his steps and proceed up the Ahwaz-Ispahan road. This threw him in contact with the Bakhtiari Khans, and he made his debut in the sphere of Bakhtiari politics. Before leaving Nasiri he had induced Sheikh Khaza'l to accept respon sibility for the Government of Northern Arabistan in his absence. 20. The Sardar Mukarram's departure was hailed with truculent joy by the inhabitants of Shuster, and in a less degree of Dizful, and Sheikh Khaza'l was at once confronted with the difficulty of finding Deputy Governors for the two towns, whom the townspeople would accept. Anyone imagined to be directly dependent on the Sardar Mukarram was anathema to them, and the Sheikh in view of his friendship with the Sardar was considered as tainted not only in his own person but also in that of his immediate subordinates. The difficulty was solved by the recent alliance with the Shahab-us- Sultanah, who supplied Khuda Karam Khan, Ohaharlang, of Kala Tul, for Shushter, and a well-known man, the Salf-un-Nizam, for Dizful. This arrangement, though promising well, cannot be said to have been particularly successful. The Sheikh's administration has been of a temporising, if not of a nominal nature, and he has made no effort to forcibly establish his authority, excusing himself on the grounds that if he dealt with the Shusteris according to their deserts he would gain nothing and would certainly be taken to task by the authorities in Tehran. Outside the town he has exercised control over the Bait Saad and A1 Kathir Arabs, but has not attempted to deal with the disturbing forces which make peace and security in the country west of Dizful unknown. These forces are principally represented by the Chanana section of * the Beni Lam residing in Turkish territory, and the Dirakwand and Sagwand Lurs. 21. Shushier. —Shuster has passed throughout the year in a chronic state of internal unrast and agitation variegated by occasional periods of peace or inertia induced by exhaustion. At the beginning of the year under report Sheikh Murtaza, son of the late Sheikh Muhammad Ali, returned to Arabistan from Tehran and was acknowledged by Sheikh Khaza'l and the Sardar Mukarram. At this time in the absence of the Sardar Mukarram from Shushter the members and the partisans of the rival house of Saiyid Abdus Samad in Shushter took the opportunity of interfering with the freedom of, and persecuting, the represen tatives and supporters of the other family. Sheikh Murtaza hearing this suddenly left Nasiri without notice and presented himself at Shushter.

Serious trouble broke out again in December in the form of domesti trouble, the cause or excuse for which was the presence of some members f the family of the late Kalantar Muhammad Kazim, who in July had b p allowed to return to Shushter from Failya, where they had for more than 611 year been under the protection or surveillance of Sheikh Khaza'l. 3 Sheikh Murtaza following the traditions of his family espoused the side of the Kalantar, but failed to effect a peaceful adjustment, lighting ensued and continued on into Eebruaiy without, however, any very serious casualty list. Partly by the intervention of the Bakhtiari Khans, partly owinp- to the advent of the Sardar Mukarram, and partly because of the absence of any sufficient subject of contention, peace was then established. The net result has probably been to weaken the position of Jhe Kalantar's family,^ who had gained considerable power on their first return, and to brin^ on Sheikh Murtaza the contumely of a considerable section of the inhabitants. 23. The trouble which arose in Southern Arabistan in connection with the purchase and sale of grain was duplicated, or forestalled, by similar trouble at Shushter. i^ n i'^ 0Vem ^ er ^ ie &lt; ^ om ^ 1]an ^ powers in the town decreed that no ffrain should be sold for export in Shushter, and later extended the embargo to the surrounding districts. The removal of grain which Messrs. Lynch Brothers had previously bought and had stored in the town was prohibited, grain, which was being brought in for them from the villages was seized, and their brokers m the Miyanab were prevented from buying. Appeal was made to Khuda Karam Khan, but he had from the beeinnin' been without a shadow of power in the town, and made no attempt to render assistance in the present case. Reference was eventually made by the Vice- onsul to Sheikh Khaza 1 and some slight degree of satisfaction was obtained. 4? eri&lt; ^ ■^- aro ^ ^ res h trouble was reported in Shushter arisino' from the seizure and deportation by the Bakhtiari Khans of a bankrupt merchant, nomine Alam. Here again Sheikh M urtaza appears to have come orwar on the less popular side, and a later story which announces the poisoning ofhis eldest brother (Sheikh Muhammad Jawad) attributes the deed 0 , ^ on jjf S r o an( i of a-n alleged difference of opinion in this case, but probably with no truth. V 25. Khuda Karam Khan left Shushter in spring. He had never been Governor m more than name. v- reV n Usly i e f lstlD ?i, ntimate fr,ei:id ^ reiations were maintained between this Vice-Consulate and Sheikh Murtaza, the Mastaufi, Mirza Tahir Khan, and the son of the Imam Juma, all persons of local importance.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAE 1907-1905. 35 26. Shuster District. —Outside tbe town of ShusMer little occurred whic his worthy of record. 'When the struggle between the Samsam us-SnLanah and the Shahab-us-Sultanah reached its crisis, the party of the former began coquetting with Sheikh Farhan Asad of the Bait Sa'ad, aod the Zia-us-Sultan with some Bakhtiaii sowars attached themselves for some time to Farhan. It was said that the intention was to keep a place of refuge, or a line of retreat, open for the Samsam, Events did not develop sufficiently to afford a means of judging of the nature or value of this seemingly strange understanding between Bakhtiari and Arab. Farhan was at various times in the bad books of Sheikh Khaza'l, but he is astute and knows how far he can go without driving tlie latter to extremes. 27. The town of Gotwand was perturbed during the summer by fighting breaking out between its two chief men, Haji Abul Fath and Asadullah Khan. The town has Ibeen in a chronic state of internal siege for the last three ytars. The two men mentioned above are' dependent on the Samsam and the Shahab respectively, and their affairs are likely ro be affected by the relations existing at any particular time between those two Chiefs. Periodically an armistice or peace is arranged through the instrumentality of the religious dignitaries of Shuster, and a modus vivendi is arrived at. 28. The peace of the district was disturbed in July by a raid ma^e at Shalaili on the Muin-ut-TujjarV warehouse, and some native boats lying there. The raiders were stated to hail from the Khasrij. Extra riflemen were placed on the S S. Shushan by the Sheikh, and it was ar anged that the river banks should be patrolled from the neighbouring villages. 29. Diz/ul. —While Dizful leads a no less^ troubled existence than Shnster does, it can lay the blame on external rather than internal s&lt; uroes of disturbance. Much of the land and property of its citizens is situated in the country to the west of the Diz river, and lie at the mercy of the Dirakwand and Sagwand Lurs r and the Chanana and other trans-border Arabs, who are not slow to take advantage of their opportunities. The present year was ra exc&lt;ption to its predecessors, and presents an almost uninterrupted succession of raids and forays, which it would be tedious to enumerate. The most noticeable f&lt; ature is the apparent in crea fed predatory activity, at least during the latter half of the year under review, of the Chanana Arabs. 30. Early in June the Saif-un~Nizam, Chiragh Ali Khan, Bakhtiari, was' deputed to the Governorship of the Dizful District. The Shahab-us-Sultanah at the same time making himself responsible for the payment of the revenue. The Saif-un-Nizam showed some activity in attempting to reduce the country-side to order, both by arranging for the policing of the caravan road to Shush ter by a son of Farhan Asad, and by tackling the portion of the Sag wand who were lingering in the district beyond the Diz river. The last move was not very successful and ended in the Saif-un-Kizam's losing, some men and horses and being blockaded in the village of Jariya Saiyid Ahmad, a position from which he only extricated himself with some difficulty. Proceeding from contempt of civil authority to impious disregard of religious sanctity, the Sagwand fell on and completely despoiled a large party of Hajis returning from Mekka by way of Amara. A pacific adjustment was, however, subsequently arranged by the intervention of tbe heads of religion in Dizful and the Saif-un-Nizara. 31.. In October civic affairs were rendered interesting by a quarrel between the Qutb-us-Sadat and the Mustaufi, the Imad-ud-Daftar, which resulted in prolonged active hostilities within the town. 32. Further distractions were provided for the inhabitants in February when the Bakhtiari Khans, the Shahab-us-Sultanah and the Salar Arfa', suddenly made their appearance at tfae gates of the town.30 'ADMINISTKATION KEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Immediately before this the Sagwand had been attacked and plundered bv the Wali of Fnsht-i-Kuh and the Beni Lam Arabs and had sought refuge the town in a semi-destitute condition. They had begged for the protection of the Bakhtiari, but this had been refused unless an excessive sum were paid up as damages for the incident of the Saif-un-Nizam. The Bakhtiaris now pressed the question and fell on such Sagwand as were within their reach. Eventually they reduced their demands and a settle- ment was arrived at. 33. The other matters with which they occupied themselves was the collection of the Dizful revenue. Here again a compromise was arrived ni certain of the principal inhabitants making themselves responsible for the payment of the revenue, less certain remissions. This point was, however, not reached until the town had been put in a state of defence and the Bakhtiaris had with difficulty seized a portion of it. They had on their side the influence of the Qutb-us-lSadat, but were hard put to it for supplies. They eventually took up their quarters in the p.ilace Kushk on the right bank of the L&gt;iz, where their presence did not serve to enhance the peace of the neighbourhood. They returned to Ah Bid towards the end of February. 84. In spring the bridge over the Diz, on which the prosperity of the town mainly depends, was seriously damaged by floods. Temporary repa rs were executed which rendered it passable, and more extensive operations were undertaken when the river readied its low summer level. A premature rise in the river in autumn, however, swept away the barrages made to facilitate tbe work, and rendered further efforts impossible. This bridge is fallins: into decay, and as there is not the slightest likelihood of its ever being submitted to intelligent and adequate restoration, its transfer to the antiquarian list of Persian public works is merely a matter of time. 35. The friendly relations now existing for some years between the Vice- Consulate and the aged and estimable chief IVIujtahid of Dizful, Sheikh Muhammad Hassan, and his son Sheik Muhammad Baqir were fully maintained during the year. T he B akhtiari. 36. Internal affairs. —The early part of the period occupying attention was marked by important events in the domestic affairs of the Bakhtiari Khans. More through the iuflnence of his brother the Shuja-us-Sultan in Tehran than by his own efforts the Shahab-us-Sultanah succeeded in securing for himself in^ April the Ilkhaniship of the tribes, while the llbegiship was con ferred on his brother, the Sarum-um-Mulk. This implied the displacement of the Samsam-us-Sultanah who was duly deposed. The Samsam resented his deposition, and for seme time affairs were in a position in which among any more virile nationality active hostilities would have been inevitable. . Orders were issued from Tehran for the despatch of the Samsam to the capital, but he defied them, and the Shahab's valour could rot rise to the point of attempting compulsion. The first part of the play was enacted at Malamir, but eventually tbe Samsam made off with what speed he might up the Ispahan road, 'like a wounded bear'—to use his own not inapt description. Establishing himself in the Chaharmahal lie set himself to destroy all law and order in the country. Caravans w ere robbed daily, and at his instigation a raid was made on the property of the Oil Syndicate by a party of Kuhgalu. The Sardar Mukarram passing through the country on his way to Luristan espoused the cause of the Shahab with whom he travelled up to Ardal. His efforts were, however, unavailing^to frighten ttie Samsam or stiffen theAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 37 back of the Shahab. Large forces were supposed to be underarms, though the number given were probably fictitious, but the reinforcement of the Sampam by the Salar Arfa returned from Europe, and Yusuf Khan from Tehran, and his own fears, proved too much for the ShahaVs valour and he ignominously gave in in the 3rd week of June. The reinstatement of the Samsam and Sbabab in their original positions of Ilkhani and Jlbegi, and the consequent exclusion from public affairs of the Sarum, ensued in due course. The Shuja-us-Sultan and ShnhaVs other brothers were little pleased ; but the reconciliation though only formal has not up to the present been broken bv any overt act. Perhaps it is permissible to imagine that the Khans have for the moment learnt wisdom from the course of their bickerings during the past two or three years, which have secured neither party any permanent advantage and have mulcted both heavily in cash presents made to the Ministers of Govern ment in Tehran. 37. The Sardar Asad has remained absent in Europe throughout the year, but the Salar Arfa, who had originally accompanied him, returned in June. Yusuf Khan and Murtaza Quli Khan bad arranged to proceed to Europe in autumn, but only the last named eventually found himself free to go. 38. External affairs. Relations with the Sheikh of Muhammerah.—ThQ relations of the Khans with Sheikh Khazal were on the whole good, showing a distinct improvement on those of the preceding year. There is desire, or at least willingness on both sides to replace contention by friendship, but the Khans' want of unanimity among themselves precludes the possibility of a definite and consistent attitude and policy, and this in conjunction with their moral delinquencies renders the r61e of the second party to any agreement difficult and ambiguous. 39. The Kuhgalu. —The year opened with a difference of opinon between the Samsam and Shahab as to the policy to be pursued in regard to AH JNaqi Khan, Chief of the Taibi Kuhgalu, and partisan of the Samsam. Shortly afterwards occurred the fall of the Samsam, and robberies within Bakhtiari territory by the followers of Ali Naqi ensued. In the end of May, Saltan Ali Khan was despatched by the Shahab to take over the Governorship of Behbahan. He had to contend against the influence of the Samsam and his conduct does not appear to have been marked by much dis cretion. He refused to recognise a local man of some importance, the Eath-d- Agha, and this individual entered into league with Ali Naqi Khan. In ^August, subsequent to the reconciliation of the Khans, he attempted to seize Ali Naqi Khan by treachery when he had been induced to come in to him, presumably on a bafe conduct. Ali Naqi Khan and his followers were, however, ready for the emergency, and a fight took place inside the precincts of the place of meeting, in which a number of persons of both sides are said to have been killed. Ali Naqi's person was secured, but he was released and allowed to go home. This action greatly annoyed the Samsam and Salar Arfa and came near to creating a breach among the Khans. Sultan Ali Khan was withdrawn in September. 40. It appears that the Khans had again set their minds on making capital out of the lawlessness of the Kuhgalu. Claims for compensation on account of the robberies on the road made by the Vice-Consul on behalf of Messrs. Lynch Brothers were met with peremptory refusal, on the grounds that the Persian Government having refused them sanction to pursue the Kuhgalu into their own country they were powerless to prevent their incursions on to the road, and they demanded that we should obtain this sanction for them from the Government. They also declared their willingness to take over the Governorship of the Kuhgalu (Behbahan) were it freed from the overlordship of the Governor- General of Ears.3g ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY They were informed that they could only hope to obtain our assistance in the matter by first meeting the claims which had prevented them. Subse quently it was decided to take punitive measures against the Kuhgalu' Eumour stated that the Persian Government had given its consent, but b tlug was denied by the Kbans. Whether with or without permission the Samsam and Sarum entered the Kuhsralu territory with a force in February. Officially this force Bumbered 12,^00 fighting men, but there is good renson to believe that it did not exceed 2,000 men all told, including a large number of non-combatants. Some operations were undertaken against a jetty Chief of the Bushman- ziari, and accounts of grtat successes were industriously disseminated. The Chiefs returned to Bamuz in March, and beyond some pacific neen- tiations and securing of a hostage of some importance, who was subsequeiitlv released, it would not seem that they had accomplished anything. 41. Mention has already been made of the appointment of Pakhtiaris to the Deputy Governorships of Shushter and Dizful under the control of Sheikh Khaza'l, and again of the actun taken by the Shahab and Salar in regard to Dizful and the Sagwand. The latter did not meet with the approval of the Sheikh Khaza'l, who was rendered further anxious by a quarrel which arose recently between the Khans and his troublesome protege Sheikh Farhan Asad of the Bait Sa'ad. 42. In autumn when at Ispahan, the Yice-Consul was apprised of a design on the part of the religious chiefs and extempore rulers of Ispahan to get the Khans into trouble with the ultimate object of having the section of the Ohaharmahal administered by them removed from their control and added to the Ispahan Governorship. In present day Persia it would be impossible for anyone who did not directly control the Bakhtiari tribes to establish the slightest degree of security in these districts. With the exception of one man of considerable influence who owns the village of Chalshutur and is stated to be disaffected to the Khans, it is questionable whether the population: affected would welcome any possible alternative to the present regime. The Ispahan Mullahs are, however, encouraging the institution of local ' Anjumans' in the neighbouring districts and the insidious and illusory notions of popular government may seize on the imagination of the Khans' subjects. There is little to commend in the Khans' administration, but it is at least preferable to the anarchy qualified by unauthorised tyranny which appears to be the only likely substitute for it. 43. It is practically certa'n that Bskhtiaris irdirectly controlled by the Samsam were responsible for the parlous state of brigandage which existed from June to -August on the Ispahan-Tehran road and in the Ispahan district. According to Persian wont this led to a proposal from head-quarters that the Samsam should be given charge of the road. The necessary negotiations had almost been completed when they were upset by the assassination of the Atabeg Azam. Subsequently, however, th^ protection of the road was, according to report, made over to the Muntazzim- ud-Daulah, the Samsam's nephew, with results which are unknown. 44. The relations of the Khans with the Central Government, as usual in recent years, were perplexed by their domestic feuds and quarrels, with which they are inextricably involved. q ^ ! tru ^ le ^ e tween the Samsam and Sahab the influence of the Shuja- ul-oultan with the Shah was much brought into play, and a prolonged attempt was made to establish the domination of his own family and secure the exclusion of the other. g T era l ly be ^ eved5 1 ' 10wever&gt; tliat tlie Atabeg's sympathies lay wish the feardar Asad s family, and that the Samsam, as the only representative of that ramily then in the Bakhtiari country, enioved his secret support aiid encouragement. ^ .w ir Since their reconcilement and the death of the Atabeg fc and probably resulting m soixje degree from both of these eauses^ the minds of theAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 39 seem to bave been occupied with sneaking dreams of disloyalty to the Persian Goyernment. In repudiating British claims and in their attitude on the Kuhgalu question a tone of inflated self-importance and independence was distiuguishable, and it will be shown further on how the sentiment which it indicated subse quently manifested itself in full blossom. 45. JEtclatiows of the ^BakJitictri with the These relations were principally in regard to the afl airs of the Concessions (Oil) Syndicate, and of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and they were extensive and by no means harmonious. The Oil Syndicate.—It will be recollected that last year's report left the narrative at the point at which a signed undertaking had been taken from the Shahab that, in the event of his becoming Ilkhani, he would satisfy all our complaints, and in particular agree to our taking over the payment of the guards. In the meantime he made himself responsible for the provision of adequate protection. After considerable delay some addition was made to the guards in May, but an opportunity of definitely arranging the question did not occur until the arrival of the Vice-Consul at Ardal towards the end of that month. The net result of two or three weeks' delay there was that the Shafcab after first trying to repudiate his undertaking altogether, asked for two or three months' grace. Shortly afterwards the Samsam was reinstated, and this, and the attitude of the Khans in general, has made it useless and inexpedient to make the matter a subject of further direct pressure. 46. The question of the payment of compensation for losses sustained by robbery, etc., which was a burning question at Kimah in March 1907, was arbitrarily settled by the deduction from the instalment of guard money fall ing due to the Khans on 15th May of the amount of the claims. 47. In the beginning of July a serious incident occurred at Batwand near Maidan Munaftun, one of the Canadian employes of the Syndicate being mobbed by a crowd of the local inhabitants. He was beaten, and narrowly escaped severe injury from stones thrown at him. The case was reported to Tehran, and His Majesty's Minister succeeded in getting the Atabeg to send telegraphic orders to the Khans for the punishment of* the offenders. The Khans sent down some Agents, but they were quite incapable of effecting what was requiied of them. Repeated reference was made to the Khans both by the Yice-Consul and the Persian Ministers, the outcome being that more efficient Agents were attached to His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul with instructions to satisfy his requirements, and eventually in the middle of October the principal offenders were brought to book and public punishment meted out to them at Batwand. The unsatisfactory way in which the Khans had acted in the matter had given rise to serious doubts as to the dangers which might be expected from a population of savages coming to the knowledge that their excesses would not meet with prompt punishment at the hands of their chiefs. Further weight was given to these apprehensions by a case of firing on a caravan, and 'of threatened violence to the local Manager at Mamatain, and the question of how best to secure the safety of the Syndicate's employes came under discus- sion between the British and Indian Governments and the Legation. A proposal was made by His Majesty's Minister, and endorsed by the Vice-Consul to the effect that the strength of the Ahwaz Vice-Consular Indian escort should be raised, and permanent detachments be posted at the sites of the Syndicate's operations with a view to securing the safety of European personnel. Meanwhile losses by theft continued as at all times, and another case of Lur truculence had occurred at Mamatain in the end of September. In this case a local headman surrounded the boring works at Shardin with armed men and commanded that work should cease. The Canadian drillers complied and then proceeded to paok up their kit with the. full intention of leaving the40 'ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY country. It was only with the utmost difficulty that they were induced to remain. 48. In the end of September the Vice-Consul visited the Khans at Shalamzar, and matters relating to the Syndicate's affairs were discussed and sundry claims on account of Messrs. Lynch Brothers were pressed. With a single petty exception the Khans met the latter in each case -with a decided non yossumus. The Samsam adopted cn the whole a non-contentious attitude and apologised for his conduct at Kimah, but his former role was now played by the Shahab who was principal spokesman, and whose manner was markedly disagreeable. Immediately after these interviews it subsequently appeared that they had telegraphed to the Legation complaining of the Vice-Consul and the fact of bis ha-vicg pressed these claims, and asking that the management of their affairs be transferred to Bis Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Ispahan. A reply was sent them reaffirming the claims, and refusing to entertain their suggestion. Again, however, in the middle of November the Shuja-us-Sultan, and the eldest sens of the Samsam and Sardar A sad presented themselves at the Legation, recited the usual list of their grievances, and again 'demanded that their relations with the Vice-Consul for Arabistan should be terminated. They asserted that they were authorised to speak and act on behalf of the ruling chiefs, and when their complaints were rejected and met by a state ment of ours, they formally declared that the Khans would no longer hold themselves responsible for the safety of the oil workers and employes. The reply to this, on the motion of the Vice-Consul, was the suspension of the guard instalment of £500 payable to the Khans on the 15th Kovemberon account of the protective arrai gem en ts for the succeeding three months. Notice of the fact ^as communicated to the Khans from Ahwaz, and was followed by an immediate alteration for the better in their tone, which has been more than maintained up to the time of writing. 49. It should be mentioned that in October, on a suggestion emanating from the Syndicate at home, instructs rs were given for the E.I.M.S. Comet to proceed from Baghdad to Ah-waz with a viev to lowing the flag and impressing the Khans Subsequently, however, the ship vas wiihdrawn on the grounds that its presence at Ahvaz vould not affect the latter purpose. 50. Almost immediately after the Khan's repudiatory declaration on the 15th November, it was finally decided to make the proposed addition to the Vice-Consular escort. The intention was coir municated to the Persian Government, who issned the necessary orders sanctionirg the introduction of the arms into the conntn. On December 16th 12 Sepoys and 8 Sowars under the conimand of Lieutenant A. T. TVilson, I.A., arrived at Nasiri, and a second officer, Lieutenant J. G. L. Banking, I.A., arrived ten days later. Work havinor been abandoned at Mamatain the whole party was even tually established at Maidan Munattun which they reached on 20tli Jarmsry. Since then no interference with the European s f aff has been attempted, though thefts have continued and violence has been offered to one Native courier and one^ grain-purchasing agent, in both cases at a considerable distance from Maidan Munaftun, Some trouble was also given to a party bringing in grain for the escort, at a time when the public mind was disturbed by the lack of rain al w nervousness as to the crop prospects. The incident has not been repeated. 51. Continuous pressure has been kept up on the Khans with refererce to the deficiency of their guards, the prevalence of thieving, and the occurrences just mentioned. The Khans have been profuse in their promises, and they have not returned to a defiant attitude, but they have failed to make good their words,AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 41 and in tile end of March it was necessary to intimate to them that they were gravely jeopardising their chances of receiving the instalment due in May. Further discussion will doubtless take place when they come here in April. They have given up mentioning most of their old spurious complaints and when interviewed by the Vice-Consul at Maidan Munaftun in January their minds were chiefly occupied with the suspension of the November instalment, the presence of the Indian guard, and the question of compensation for land occupied. The last question has, however, until now remained in statu quo owing to their own apathy. The November instalment was finally paid to them in Pebruary,' as they saw tit to disown the sentiments expressed and the action taken by their relatives in Tehran. A bill for compensation for losses incurred from March to the end of 1907 amounting to Krans 12,784*85 was presented to them, and the amount was withheld from the Pebruary instalment, which they had asked should be paid to Messrs. Lynch Brothers against their claims. It was intimated to them that this was done out of consideration for their convenience, but that if they preferred to remit cash the part of the instalment held back would be paid on their account like the rest to Messrs. Lynch Brothers. 52. On the whole progress has been made during the year. The develop ment of a dangerous feeling of license and impunity in the behaviour of the local population towards the Company's servants appears to have been success fully checked. Thieving though still constituting one of the most aggravating among the difficulties of the Syndicate, has not been perpetrated with the gusto and maliciousness which were noticeable a year ago. Most important of all, the Khans' demeanour has changed from one of bullying and threatening insolence to one of verbal complaisance and civility, which at least indicates respect. The principal factors in producing these results have been the introduction of the Indian guards by the order of the British Government and the suspension of the instalment, the firm and unvacillating but not un- conciliatory policy pursued by His Majesty's Legation, and the restriction of all communications to and from the Khans to one channel. 33. Messrs. Lynch Brothers* Affairs. —Before dealing with the develop ments of these during the year under report it is necessary to briefly summarize the course of events which had led up to the position existing at the beginning of the year. In 1904 when the bigger Khans were at Tehran the opportunity was seized by the Legation of discussing with them the financial position existing between themselves and Messrs. Lynch Brothers, which owing to default in payment on their part had become involved and obscure. The principal matter was that of the account relating to the construction of the Ahwaz-Ispahan Road. Messrs. Lynch Brothers claimed the sum of £8,500 which they had expended on the work against the sum of £5,500, which was that for which the Khans has bound themselves. The principal advanced was to be repaid in 25 equal annual instalments, and the Khans on their part had allowed the payment of these periodic claims to fall into arrears. After prolonged discussion the Khans agreed to pay 30,000 Tumans instead of the original 27,500 as the equivalent of £ 5,000, but on the under standing that the account and payments were to be placed on a basis of Persian currency. On the other hand Messrs. Lynch Brothers were informed by His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the British Government could not support their claim for the extra £3,000 or for 12 per cent, interest on arrears due, and they were informed that in future the account should be kept in Persia currency. A statement of the arrears and the future payments due from them was handed to the Khans, and they promised to abide by, and act on, it. Some six months later they discharged their arrears; but since then the payments made by them have been inadequate and after their due dates.42 administration report of the persian gulf political residency 45. Matters were allowed to slide on in this manner until in j uile ^ uutii in June IQA* the question was brought to the front again by the British Poreign Office forwarded a statement of claims submitted by Messrs. Lynch Brothers * This statement included a calculation of claims on account of incurred in painting and repairing the bridges ic 1902, 1903, and which only a small portion has been recovered. Messrs. Lynch Broth renewed the claim for the extra £3,000, and 12 per cent interest on arrears^ 8 The whole matter was discussed by His Majesty's Minister with H* Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul during the visit of the latter to Tehran in j i 1907, and it was decided to press the claims after they have been brought conformity with the rulings of His Majesty's Secretaries for Poreign ^Afp 10 The claims so revised^ up to 3rd March 1907 amounted to Krans 29,47^0 on account of construction and Krans 18,476*36 on account of bridee rei a and these were presented to the Khans at Shalamzar by the Vice-Consul in th' end of September. 0 The Khans eventually accepted the former claim and promised to pav if without delay. The latter claim they entirely repudiated, no doubt partlv owing to the unfortunate fact that the 1904 bill had never previously been presented to them. It amounted to nearly Krans 15,000 or about four times more than either of the previous bills, and apparently on these grounds Hi Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Ispahan, Mr. Preece, had without enquiry declined to present it and the matter had been allowed to rest at this On examination now, however, there seemed to be no ground for believing that full value had not been given for the sum claimed, and hence it was presented. The Khans put forward various arguments which were not considered valid and finally declared their repudiation of it with some asperity. Minor claims were presented at the same time on a claim for a case of opium robbed on the road in autumn 1906 and another for robbery on the road perpetrated in August of the current year. The former of these they promised to satisfy, but the latter they repudiated on the grounds that the robbery had been done by Kubgalu whom thev were not allowed to pursue. ^ 55. So much for the Khans' statements, now for tbeir performance. The construction account claims have remained unpaid with the exception of Krans 12,46514 out of the Pebruary oil instalment, which they requested should be paid over to Messrs. Lynch Brothers. _ The bridge repair claims have remained unsatisfied, but a subsequent chum under this head for repairs effected in September 1907 amounting to Krans 4,477 was paid in full in March. 8 Pirst instalments of the claim for the case of opium as paid in March 'P t0 of whioh Kraii s 1.420 had been paid out of a total of Jlrans 2, d 01 , o0.

The Khans have professed ignorance of the robbery of the claim, and resorted to all the usual arts of procrastination. , 56 :. ^ instalment of the Road Construction Account and the interest on the capital fall due on 3rd March of each year. Notice of the_ new instalment falling due was sent to the Khans in e ruary 1908, and an exact statement of their entire indebtedness in regard to tne construction and bridge repair accounts on 3rd March 1908 was sent to • e J n , 8 or y a fter that date, and it is hoped that this practice mav be followed m tuture years. Unless expressly informed the Khans never know what is due rom nem or on what date it was due, and this assists them in prevaricating. fnl ^6 e pi*ig of claims constantly vital, and in evidence is a very ungrate- tii« Au ltS lm P 0 i£ ance cannot be exaggerated in dealing with persons of tne type ot the present Khans. orAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 43 67. Miscellaneous Affairs discussed with Bis Britannic Majesty s Vice- Consul. —When met at Maidan MuDaftun in January, the Sahab and Salar propounded a very startling proposal. This was that hnving lost faith in and respect for, the Persian Government they were anxious to cut themselves a drift from it and place themselves under British protection. They cited the cases of Koweit and Maskat as representing what they were aiming at. We had previously made proposals to raise levies of their subjects and drill them hnt they had not felt ready for such a step; they were now prepared to welcome it. also proposed to form an alliance with the same general object with Sheikh Khaza'l with whom they implied that they had opened negotiations. The British Government would be asked to ratify the alliance and make itself responsible for the observance of its terms by both parties, an artless and characteristic revelation of the state of mind of the Khans who durin^ the last two years have been chiefly occupied in doing all in their power to remove every trace of justification for putting reliance- on their good faith and integrity. In reality the subject was only broached to the Sheikh in February or March ^hen his representative Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar visited the Khans at Ab Bid. The Sheikh laughs at the crudem ss of the Khnns' ideas and is not likely to be carried away by them. 58. Descending to more practical matters the Khans stated their desire to build a bridge over the lower Karun in connection with which they would construct a track leading to some of the summer pastures of the tribes. They asked that they might be inforrred what would be the expense involvedm obtaining an English Engineer to inspect and report on the project. r .. Iftfr however, in reply to enquiries, they wrote that they had no inten tion of building the bridge, but only of undertaking the construction of the track. It is understood that the Government of India propose to direct the Assistant Engineer in the Persian Gulf to visit the ground and report on what may be required. .n 0 ^' matter discussed by the Khans was the purchase of 3|}0 rifles, for the import of which they held a Customs permit. They determined on trying to obtain a certain proportion of the short Lee-Enfield rifles and the remainder Martini-Henrys. They have since had some dealings' with Messrs. Lynch Brothers in the matter, and it is understood that the latter have tentatively placed an order for 50 rifles with their London house. Import or delivery would, however, only be made against payment. The latest development, however, is that urgent telegraphic instructions nave been received by the Director of Customs at Muhammerah from Tehran cancelling the permit. 60 Ftscal. An embargo on the sale of grain in the Bamuz district was imposed by the Khans in January. As Messrs. Lvnch Brothers were affected reference was made by the Vice-Consulate to'the Khans, and the restrictions disappeared. About the same time a general sumptuary order was issued forbidding the use of tea and sugar and certain other articles of luxury, such as limes, by Bakhtian subjects. This order has been fairly rigorously enforced, at any rate in the towns and villages, but clandestine trade in tea and sugar goes on. European firms, which cannot do business in this manner, are, however, affected, and in particular the Dutch firm of ter Meulen and Gratama was said to have been inconvenienced. British interests for the time being not being involved the matter has not been taken up by the Vice-Consul, and it is hoped that the regulations will eventually die a natural death. Considering the difficulty which the Khans have in controlling the reedom or their subjects in much less legitimate and reasonable directions M44 'ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY their comparative suceess in enfereing these arbitrary and irritating restrictions is curious and interestii g as revealing an unexpected feature in the eug ma of the relations of the rulers and the ruled. Lurtstan. 61 The fact of the Sardar Mukarram's appointment to the Governorship of Luristan in April and his departure for the head-quarters of his new charge first by way of Dizful and later through the Bakhtiari country, have already been mentioned. His passage through the Bakhtiari country coincided in part with that of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and several meetings took place. The Sardar took occasion to give expression to what professed to he his ambitions and intentions in regard to Luristan, and more Specially in regard to the opening of the Dizful-Khurramabad road, and he _ endeavoured to obtain a statement of British policy in respect to the latter object. The Sardar was accompanied by Khan jan Khan Sagwand, who had since the previous year devoted himself to his service. 62. It was anticipated that the Sard.ar would have much difficulty in dealing with the Salar-ud-Haulah who had set up the standard of open revolt and joined himself to the Eath-us-Sultan of the Dilfan. These expectations were, however, falsified by the sudden submission of the Salar on the arrival of some sort of force whose despatch had been organised at Tehran. The Salar in the first place fled to Kevmanshah where he took hast at the British Consulate. Afterwards having received assurances of the safety of his person he surrendered himself to the Government's agents and was conducted to Tehran where his fortunes cease to interest us. The path having bren thus cleared for the Sardar Mukarram before his arrival, he had no difficulty in establishing his authority at Khurramabad. No very clear account of his doings is available, but it is known that he declared the Fath us-Sultan a rebel, and that he got in touch with the Dirakwand. Negotiations with the latter resulted in, or were followed by, a small Kafilah passing down through their country to Diztul in August. But this in itself meant little, the complaisance of the Dirakwand occasionally allowing small parties of favoured persons to traverse their country, and up to the time of writing there are no signs that the solution of the problem of the road has been in any way advanced. Operations were at one time undertaken, it is stated with some success, against the Bairanwand with the object of exacting the revenue demand from them. In the end of October there were rumours that the Sardar had come down with Fazil Khan and Hassan Gidaw Sagwands, according to some to Qilab. according to otliers to Saimarra, and it was asserted that he would enter Dizful at the conclusion of the Bamzan. This rumour was not, however, translated into fact, and it was probably started only to intimidate the Shushteris. 63, In Pebiuary news w r as received of the arrest and imprisonment of Fazil Khan, Hassan Gidaw and Khanjan Khan. The seizure of tliese men was probably in connection with the payment of revenue due from the Sagwand tribe, but the inclusion among tliem of Khanjan was a strange and ill-juHged action. He had served the Salar w T ell and faithfully and his services could not be safely dispensed with, though it appears that the Sardar thought that the Shahab-us-Lashkar, an extra-Luristan minor Chief, would take his place. It is also said that the arrest of Khanjan was not originally intended and was caused by his resisting the arrest of the others while they were in his company. Shortly afterwards the discontent which had been growing against the Sardar's regime among the townspeople of Khurrambad came to a head and they invoked the assistance of the Eateh-us-Sultan. The latter came with force, and besieged the Sardar Mukarram, who had taken up PiAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 45 quarters in a fort just outside the town. The Sardar with his various supporters soon capitulated and he was removed and confined in the house of the Imam Juma, and council was taken to put him to death. In the meantime the Sagwand Chiefs were released and joined the Pateh us-Sultan, who issued a manifesto to the Sagwand who had remained down in Arabi^tan. In this manifesto he indicated the intention of organising a general advance against the Waliof Pusht-i-Kuh. This dream was not, however, to be realised. The Sardar Mukarram, thrown on his wits, succeeded in addressing a letter to the townspeople point ing out the terrible consequences which would accrue to the towm were his sacred person abused. The argument was taken up by one Mullah Hashid to such good purpose that the people rose, released and reinstated the Sardar, demolished his late prison, and imprisoned the Imam Juma. Some shooting took place, and the Pateh-us-Sultan and the Sagwand Khans, seeing the town now against* them, fled with their followers. The Sardar has since remained to all appearance firmly reinstalled at least in his local authority. 64. The only f^ct that remains to be chronicled is the death of Khanjan. He arrived in March in the course of his wanderings at Bairanwand camp in the Ohingai country, where he sickened and died. Eutnours of foul play were at first current and connected his death with the presence in the camp ef a daughter of his old rival Mehr Ali Khan, w^ho was poisoned by the Salar- ud-Daulah. Later accounts say, however, that he had been sufiVring for some days from severe fever, and that his death was due entirely to this natural cause. However caused, Khanjan's death is only to be deeply regretted. He was a man of great vitality and force of character rendered attractive by a certain personal charm. Though lacking the superficial knowledge of the affairs of ths outer world which passes tor culture in Persia, he was wide-minded and had the wisdom and sagacity which are born of a practical and intimate experience of men under strenuous circumstances, and is not to be gained by a mere indifferent acquaintance, however extensive. He had a practical talent for affairs and the control of men, combined with a sincerity and good faith, and enlightened ambitions which made him strangely unique in Luristan and would have rendered him happily conspicuous in more favourable surroundings. He has passed away in his prime as his age probably did not much exceed 45 }ears, and the Biitish Government has lost one who was anxious to serve it and whose service, had the occasion arisen to use it, would have formed a happv contrast to the cankered fidelity of our time-honoured friends the Bakhtiari Khans. In this country evorythinar depends on the character of individuals and the occurrence of relative probity and sincerity is rare bevond belief. The whole race is infected with avarice to which parentage may be traced the had faith, corruption and majority of other vices which go to form the serious side of the Persian character. 65. The Lurutnn Road Scheme.—Th.Q Luristan road scheme has not come forward during the year in any practical form. The professed interest of the Sardar Mukarram in the opening of a route between Dizful and Khurramabad has already been referred to. It remains to mention that the Muin-ut-Tujjar approached the Legation on the subject with a proposal that the Persian ^ Transport Company should make over its rights to him or to a company organised by him. He represented that the influence he could exert on the Majlis and the fact of his beino- a Persian would make it possible for him to render the concession workable, which it was impossible tor a Toreign Company to do.40 ADMINISTKATION BEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The Muin's proposals were not very precise, but after due consideration it was not considered advisable to recommend the Transport Company t attempt to enter into any form of partnership with him. 66. In autumn a scheme of some magnitude for the opening of a trade route between Ahwaz, Dizful and Krrmanshah was submitted by jjj 8 Majesty's Consul at Kermanshah, \\hich will no doubt receive full mention in the Political Report of that officer., Pusht-i-Ktjh. 67. The internal history of the Pusht-i-Kuh during the year appears to have been marked by no important events. On the other hand its external affairs have been the subject of a considerable body of popular rumour. It appears tolerably certain that in the hot weather the Wali had an engage- . naent on the frontier with some Turkish troops, whom he defeated with some eclat In January he seems to have taken part in a general scheme for the dis. ciplining of the tribes of Luristan, sanctioned by the Persian Government. The Wali joined forces with the Beni Lam of Sheikh Gadhban, and fell on the Sagwand in the country between Diz and Karkha rivers and routed them plundering much of their property. The professed intention was, it is understood, to punish the Sagwand for not obeying the Sardar Mukarram's summons to come up-country. The Sardar Mukarram was himself to tackle the Dirakwand, but it is doubtful whether he ever quitted Khurramabad, and it is certain that nothing was accomplished. With the plundering of this section of the Sagwand, the scheme apparently died out. ^ Again in February circumstantial accounts were current of the Wali's having attacked, whether with or without provocation being unknown, some Arab subjects of the Turks, and of his having put a large number of them to the sword. Still later he is said to have cut up a Turkish force, the composi tion of which is not stated. The latest rumour is that he has fallen out wath Sheikh Gadhban, with whom he has marriage relations and with whom some sort of working alliance appears to have existed for some time. . On various occasions during the year letters have been received from Kaid Khani, the Wali's Agent, reiterating the Wali's desire to make the personal acquaintance of the Vice-Consul. Up to the present, however, it has not been found possible to pay a visit to Pusht-i-Kuh. British Enterprise and Commercial and Political Activities. 68. Messrs. Lynch Brothers.— Agency at Ahwaz was held from May to Pebruary by Mr. Redfern in place of Mr. E. A. Wilson, who was on leave during that period. The Agency at Muhammerah since Mr. Redfern vacated it m April has been in charge of a British Indian subject. Between August and November there was great activity on both tlie trading and shipping sides, owing to the large quantity of wheat available for Z^ 3 ? 6 ; 1 , exported on their own account about 20,000 bags of wheat, and the Malamir carried in all about 30,000.

S P::fr ib !' e The of the latter throughout ha. been very hesitating, but shortly before the close of the period under review their Agent here received instructions to proceed with the work. Owing to an untimely and excessive rise in the river the site has been under water and it lias been impossible to commence operations. Messrs. Lynch Brothers' affairs with the Bakhtiaris have been carried on entirely through the medium of this Vice-C. nsulate, and detailed mention of tnem has already been made. 70. The BahUiari Road, —Certain, but inadequate, repairs were executed on the road during the year by tbe orders of the Khans, and the road has remained practicable. In autumn a diversion of some two miles to avoid a toad piece of landslip was being constructed above Shalil. ^ j T 0 ll 011 brid ^ es were repainted and overhauled by an engineer despatched by Messrs. Lynch Brothers in September. The downward passage desirable ' P revented a11 the work being done which was By an unfortunate misunderstanding the engineer was despatched without time being given to approach the Khans on the subjtct, and extract their consent. As soon as notice of his intended despatch was received reference was made to the Khans, but it turned out that the engineer was by that time already engaged on the work. Immediately afterwards it fell to discuss the cla;ms for expenses incurred in repairing the bridges in former years, and the objection which the Khans put forward most strongly was the alleged fact ot the repairs executed in 1904 having been undertaken without their beinf consulted. 0 71. On the present occasion the engineer discovered serious defects in the torm ot cracks in the masonry of the bridges. It is understood that Messrs, liyncn .Brothers are having iron bands made in England to be affixed on the damaged piers, but no formal reference on the subject has reached the Vice- Consulate either from the Company or from the Government. It has therefore been impossible to represent the matter to the Khans. ^ geil&lt;3 y opened at Dehkurd in the beginning of 1907, was visited by ,6 v ice-Consul in June, when it was gathered that it was not at all in a nourishing condition, owing apparently to the failure of Messrs. Lynch Brothers to place goods on the market at the prices equal to, or lower than, those locally current. Further the strong religious party in the place had shown hostility, the Company s agents at Ispahan and Deh Kurd had not been at one, and the acting agent at Ahwaz did not believe in the feasibility of the scheme. . TS- The Concessions {Oil) Syndicate. —A strenuous activity was main- timed throughout the year by the Syndicate, but without any happy result. C0ns e { l u ence of the adverse opinions as to the hopes of success expressed by the local General Manager, Mr. Reynolds, a geological expert, was sent out trom England in December, and on the strength of his reports the borings at Mamatain and Shardin, which had reached depths of some 2,200 and 1,900 feet, respectively, were stopped, and the bulk of the staff were transferred to re-enforoe those employed at Maidan Munaftun. Here two borings are in course of progress, the first of which was begun in the end of January. By the end of March these borings bad been carried down to about 600 and 200 feet respectively. Mr. Eeynolds is now entirely pessimistic as to the prospects48 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY; of obtaining oil in paying quantities and predicts the earl^ closing of these borings and witb tliem of tbe operations of the Syndicate. The staff has been reduced to the lowest possible limit since the commence ment of the calendar year, but Mr. Eeynolds, whose agreement expired in January, was induced to renew his engagement for a further period of six mouths. The Syndicate's work has throughout been heavily handicapped by the continual thefts and occasional display of hostility by the people of the locality, a state of things which is entirely attributable to the failure of the Khans to make those arrangements for the protectioa of the Company 's interests which were necessary and which they were bound by the terns of their agreement to make. The provision of supplies, firewood, etc., has also been a matter of great difficulty, and in February and March the Syndicate was threatened by the total failure of its water supply, at all times insufficient and distant. 74. One British Indian subject visited Ahwaz for a short time in autumn in connection with the wheat trade. 75. Karun Irrigation Scheme. —No local developments occurred in the Karun Irrigation Scheme, and the question has dropped from public atten tion. Major Morton, R.E., concluded his researches in connection with it and was recalled to India in August. 76. The presence of two British officers with the Indian Oil Guards and the fact that one of them, Lieutenant Wilson, had a taste for, and experience in, military surveying gave an opportunity for improving the existing maps. During spring he was able to cover the ground lying between Ahwaz Hamuz, Balun, Malamir and Shusbter, and to produce a very satisfactory prismatic compass survey of the tract. He has further collected very complete information from a military point of view regarding that district. Ek work will be submitted to the Intelligence Branch when completed. F oreign enterprise and activities^ 77. Bussia. —The Russian Government was represented throughout the year by the Dutch merchant, M. P. ter Meulen. There were no signs of commercial or political activity. A native agent of the firm represented by the name Telesky visited Dizful and Shushter in the beginning of 1908. He collected a considerable amount, some 5,000 Tumans, of outstanding claims of the Company at the former place, and it is also said that he was similarly successful at the latter. 78.

There they do not seem to have attempted any political activity, but they leased a part of the river bank for use as a wharf at the extravagant price of 10,000 Krans per annum. This was leased from the Sheikh and the terms bear the stamp ot: the mediation of Haji Eais. Haji Eais is also understood to have bought barley on behalf of the Germans, and he holds the agency for their newly established line of steamers (The Hamburg-A merika). 79.

It had been leased when the river was high, and wlipn the water receded Haji Rais at once denied the exclusive rights of M. ter Menlen in the foreshore. It was only during the past spring that further negotiations resulted in the establishment of M. ter Meulen's claims in consideration for seme increase in the pecuniary terms of the lease. • 80. Persian commercial enterprises.—~ The Muin-ut-Tujjar's steamer, the Nusrat, has continued to ply on the lower Karun. Owing to the abundance of enrgo provided by the heavy wheat export its presence was not injurious to Lynch's steamer, the Malamir, Needless to say nothing has been done to look after the ship and its engines in particular are in a very unsatisfactory condition and require overhauling. Just recently an Englishman has been engaged as a Captain, and it is to be feared that his influence may tend to prolong the life of the vessel. 81. A new steam boat for use on the upper river between Ahwaz and Shushter has been put together at Muhammerah. It is named the Mauvin and is expected up at Ahwaz shortly. The Nusrat is not believed to be paying its way, and the prospects of the new boat doing so # are nil. The Shushan, up to the present the only steamer on ttie field, has always worked at a heavy loss. 82. The goods store erected by the •Muin-ut-Tujjar at Shalaili was brought to the ground by heavy floods which occurred in the end of March. Its construction was faulty. 83. The Nazim-ut-Tujjar, the Muin-ut-Tujjar's nephew, came to Ahwaz in December and has remained there since. It is believed he enjoys some notoriety for complicity in an attack on the British Residency at Bushire, and for an attempt to make away with his uncle's life. He called on the Vice-Consul and expressed friendship, and up to th e present has given no cause for complaint. 84. Visitors, —Mr. P. L. Loraine, formerly Secretary to the Embassy at Constantinople, passed through Ahwaz on his way to take up the appointment of 3rd Secretary to the Legation at Tehran, lie had travelled from Constantinople by way of Baghdad and was accompanied by Mr. Jay, a Secretary to the American Embassy to the Porte. They left Ahwaz on 24ith April proceeding by way of the Bakhtiari country and Ispahan. 85. In November an individual describing himself as Sardar Amir Muhammad Khan, Afghan, follower of ex-Amir Ayub Khan, made his appearance at Ahwaz and wanted his way made smooth through the Bakhtiari country. As he was unprovided with kit necessary, and as the country was in a somewhat disturbed condition, successful endeavours were made to discourage him. He appeared to be on a begging mission to Tehran, and when he learned that the conditions were not favourable for successful mendicancy, he readily abandoned his proposed journey, and returned to India.

LORIMER, Captain, I.A., Ei» Britannic Majesty*s Vice-Gonsul for Arahistan, A hwaz, &gt; The 29th April 1908.}© AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAE 1907-1908. 51 CHAPTER III, ADMINISTEAIION EEPORT OP THE KBEMANSHAH CONSULATE EOR THE TEAR 1907-1908. The name of the district is variously given as Kermanshah and Eerman- Geographical, shahan, the latter being more correct whether for the town or for the Goyernorship. 1 lie limits of the Kermanshah Consulate comprise the Governments of Kermatishahan, Kurdistan with Gerus, Bamadan &amp;nd Malayer. The latter will be found marked on few maps, but its position will be sufficiently indicated by the position of its capital Douletabad ; it also includes the minor Governorship of Neh a vend and Toisirkan. In the Administration Report of the Vice-Consul of Arabistan for 1905-1906 it will be noted that Huleilan is stated as being m Luristan. This is a misconception which has arisen through that tract being administered by the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, its present possessor by purchase. ^ Huleilan is situated about 28 miles from the town of Kermanshahan, within which district it lies, its boundary line with Luristan being shown by the course of the river Karkhah, known there as the Saimarreh or Sadmarreh; only a few acres with an Imamzadeh being on the further side of the river. The revenues of this tract of land are paid by the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh to the Governor of Kermanshah. Another point in the Administration Report of the same year needs revision : the northern limits of Kurdistan extend only as far as a point beyond Serdasht, taking from thence a north-east by east direction so as to include the town and Deputy-Governorship ofSakkiz. The country beyond lies within the Deputy-Governorship of Mukri and Souj Bulak, having connection with -Azarbaijan, Boundary lines between the Various districts are non-existent, at any rate in this part of the world. I attach a sketch map of the Kermanshah Consulate District which, I hope, is fairly accurate. Except for the districts of Kermanshahan and Malayer the boundaries must be taken as approximate. The course of the Hamadan- Kazwin road will be reported later. The previous year had ended in storm over the elections for the local Political - assembly : the storm has continued throughout the year under report with the result that Governors have changed with remarkable rapidity, the want of settled power at Tehran being reflected in Kermanshahan, A few days before the end of the previous year Amir Afkl'am, the Governor, unable to cope with the situation, had been dismissed or had resigned, and for fear of reprisals from the people had fled in the night two days before the date of his appointed departure. 1 was not so impressed with Amir Afkham as a Governor during the period of his residence as I have been since he left; of all our experiments in the way of rulers he was the sole one who showed any power of meeting the difficulties or understanding the trend of affairs and had the Commissioners from Tehran been sent to decide on the legality of the elections at the time he demanded much of what happened subsequently might have been avoided. The new Governor Saif-ed-Douleh arrived on the 2nd of April: disturbances ceased temporarily in order that it List of Governors for the year. Shabzadeh Saif-ed-Douleh 2nd April to ' 6th June.

It was soon evident that disorders were to commence again for the Governor early gained the reputation of a weak, but avaricious, man who cared but little for what might result as long as he succeeded in collecting money. On the 16th April Saif-ed-Douleh visited the local assembly as elected by the people, on the occasion of its first meeting, and presented his congratula tions, promising to send an official to be in attendance at future meetings This was his first and greatest mistake, for all the subsequent trouble may be traced to this act. He had no intention of fulfilling his promise, and it was merely one of the forms of the usual Persian ' haute politique ' in order to lull the adversary to security; had there been any immediate action for him to take there might have been some point in his procedure, but as his only object was to gain time he merely defeated his own end. The assembly awaited the arrival of the official promised, but all enquiries were met with the usual e&lt; Imroz, farda.' In the end getting suspicious they wrote to the Governor a strongly worded letter demanding an immediate answer. The Governor asked for two days' grace. In the meantime a telegram arrived from Tehran assembly saying that it would be far better that there should be no local assembly than that blood should be spilt over a matter which was intended for the benefit of the people. About the same date a son of one of the leading mujtabids of Kerbela was passing through Kermanshah and consented to remain in the place with a view to bringing about a reconciliation between the two parties—an attempt foredoomed to failure. The two days' grace allowed to the Governor having expired at the begin ning of May, he attempted again to lull the suspicions of the people by ordering that Muin-ur-Eaya, Rais-ut-Tujar and Sheikh Abdul Hussain of the aristocratic party should be expelled from the town. The fighting which had taken place in the previous year had been in connection with the arrest of these three men. The order of expulsion was obeyed, and the three concerned went out to the village of the Rais-ut-Tujar, which is only about three or four farsakhs from Kermanshah, and thus the situation rested temporarily. In the meantime there had been constant rumours of the proximity of His Imperial Highness Salar-ed-Douleh, the brother of tlie Shah, at the head of an army which varied in numbers from 20,000 up to 60,000 ! On the 16th May I received a letter from His Imperial Highness saying that he was at Alishtar in Luristan about 50 miles from Kermanshah ; he wished me to meet him there as he had matters of State importance which he wished to discuss with me. His messenger told me that His Imperial Highness having quarrelled with the Shah wished to become reconciled through the mediation of the British Government as he had no faith in the representions of the Shah. The latter asked me to send a reliable man if I could not come myself. I telegraphed to the Minister, and on receipt of orders wrote to Salar-ed- Douleh informing him that the Shah was willing to promise him safety and forgiveness and expressing our pleasure in being of any assistance in bringing about a reconciliation. I sent my Mirza with the above letter. To return to the state of affairs in the town : a protest was made to the Governor concerning the proximity of the three men deported, but the minds of the people were too much excited over the doings of the Salar-ed-Douleh to consider domestic matters. There were rumours that Kangawar, a small town between Kermaushah and Hamadan, was to be attacked and some even began to lay m stores for a siege. On the 30th May the Mirza returned with an answer from Salar-ed-Douleh. He made no reference to my letter, but rormulated his demands,^ which^ were in the main that he should continue in t 1 ? ^ 0 J e rnment of Luristan with Arabistan, Burujird and Nehavend, to the c e . . w ' lc b places he was related by marriage, and after various further conditions stated that if the intercession of the British, which he took for granted, were not successful he would not be responsible for the consequences. While the Mirza was at the camp Salar told him that he would not goto ^ehran, as his brother wished, there to be put out of the way by a cup of Persian coffee. He would rather die fighting than in the manner named. He snowed the Mirza letters promising assistance from various parts of them AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR THE YEAfi, 190M90S. 5^ country including one from Tabriz, which contained an invifatation from the people of that place asking him to come there as the people of Azarhaijan were nervous that the Atabeg was about to take away from them the Consti tution. From my later knowledge of Salar I am inclined to think that these letters were in the main forgeries made by himself. Daood Khan Kalhor also was supposed to have written saying that he would not fight against His Imperial Highness—a promise which, if made, he fulfilled by being the chief factor in preventing Salar from taking Nehavend. While the Mirza was in the Lur camp a letter came from the Eussians telling His Imperial Highness to write to the Russian Consul at Kermanshah who would do all he could to help him. Salar expressed great distrust of the Eussians to the Mirza, and said the English were the cause of the constitution which the Shah and Atabeg detested: I am afraid that he had no higher motive than this for turning to the English. (M. Nicolsky, the Russian Consul, was sent for from Eussia on account of Salar-ed-Douleh, but arrived after the incident Was finished.) Salar stated to the Mirza that, if it came to fighting, he did not propose to attack Kermanshah, which contained Consuls and a bank, but that he would loot Nehavend and Douletabad. After my Mirza's return the Russian acting Consul, M. Petroff, called on me and said that he had received a letter from Salar-ed-Douleh, but did not mention that it was in answer to a letter from his own Mirza, formerly his agent at Khurramabad. I now received orders that I was to keep the Eussian Consul informed of everything, and after this date we acted in concert. On the 30th May Salar sent me a second letter saying that Amir Afkham and Zahir-ed-Douleh, the Governor of Hamadan, had been told off to treat with him but he had refused to agree to anything except through the British Lega tion. The Mirza had taken nine days going and coming to and from Salar's camp. It appeared to me, then, advisable to go to Kangawar three stages from Kermanshah where there is a Telegraph Office and from whence I could keep in closer touch with affairs. M. Petroff agreed to come with me, and having obtained permission, we started off on the 30th May. On the second dav after we arrived at Kangawar M. Petroff received a telegram from his Minister saying that both Consu\s were to go to meet Salar-ed-Douleh, At the same time I received a telegram from the Minister saying that there were telegrams of state importance awaiting me at Kermanshah which I was to obtain. We received information that Salar had moved to Khavva \\hich is only ^5 miles from Kerraanshah. The same evening I received telegrams informing me that fighting had broken out between the two parties in the town, that some 13 had been killed, and the people's party had taken refuge in the Consulate, to the number of about 2j000. I accordingly decided to send my baggage to Harsin, one stage from Khawa, to ride into Kermanshah in one day, arrange matters in the town and then ride out again and meet the baggage. M. Petroff agreed to accompany me and we arrived in Kermanshah on the evening of the 4th June. I found the Consulate grounds crowded. On the 1st June W T asook-el-Memalik, the accountant-general of the army and one of the moving spirits among the officials, had been going through the streets when a dispute arose, the people attacked him wounding him severely about the head; his escort replied with their revolvers, the riot commenced and was carried on throughout the day. The following morning the troops composed of Kerind Eegiment, the Sinjabi sowars and some infantry of the Zangineh Eegiment started looting the town. The bazaars were hastily closed but the soldiers broke open the shops carrying off everything they contained. The amount of loss entailed cannot be estimated but the bazaar within a radius of the central square was swept from one end to the other. Some idea of the damage done can be estimated from the fact that one Eussian subject alone lost a sum of Tumans 20,000 or about £4,000. The people state that the order for the looting was given by Saif-ed- Douleh himself. Whoever may have been the originator, if there was one, there is a little doubt that the official classes benefited largely and a good part54 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY of the loot found its way to the house of Azam-ed-Douleh, afterwards nor Governor of the town. ^ On the evening of the 1st His Britannic Majesty's Consular Suree Captain Crossle, had been informed that there was an idea of taking refuee 0 ■ 1, the Consulate : he bad replied that it could not be permitted and closed th 1 front gate of the grounds. As, however, the garden has no walls that was not great hindrance and the people came pouring in from the boundaries, among f them Mullah Agha Mahommad Mehdi, the leader of the popular party h* brother, Mullah Agha Mahmood, and four out of the six elected members of tlT assembly, together with the chiefs of all the various trades. Captain Crcssl 6 very wisely confiscated all tteirarms, a procedure which I kept up all the tiai 0 they were in 'bast.' I now received orders that I was not to leave Kerman- shah. (It appears that the Russian Minister had given the order that the two Consuls were to go to meet Salar-ed-Douleh under some misunderstandinf? with the result that His Britannic Majesty's [Minister was srmewhat puzzled by my unauthorised movements.) I was further instructed to inform the Gov ernor that these people had come to the Consulate against my express wishes' that they had no right to appeal to a foreign Consul in this manner, and that I should be glad if arrangements could be m^de by which they would leave peaceably as 1 had no means at my disposal to expel them. I informed the Governor in the terms of the above orders, which represented the position which was taken up both at Tehran and at Kerinaii. shah throughout the incident. I received messages both from Atabeg and the' Shah saying that it was extraordinary that a British Consul should protect rioters (for of course the people were made to bear the blame for having been looted) but I replied in the usual terms, referring them to the Minister in Tehran. Throughout the affair Sir Cecil Spring-Eiee impressed upon me the necessity of showing no partizanship and of avoiding the appearance of taking sides. I attempted to carry out these orders to the letter but the Persiars in Kermanshfah had a fixed idea that they owed the Constitution to the English that the telegram which King Edward VII was supposed to hare sent to the Assembly congratulating them was a genuine message (the Russian Consul was to a great degree responsible for this idea), and that the English being ruled by a Constitutional Goyernment would always be prepared to help the peonle's side ; this idea was supported by the sympathetic tone of the British press and in consequence all my attempts to show impartiality, while at the same time refusing to expel the refugees for want of force, merely gained for me with the aristocratic party the reputation of a deep and cunning diplomatist. The ignorance of the local people, even country Goyernors, in such matters is some- what amazin^ '6* On the morning of the Cth June a letter was placed in my hands bv a tions^the filf ^ en i C ! 0Sed in Whicl1 1 fonild two oommunica- f was addressed to my Mirza and the second I took for wCt ft meant M t -' # tl19 . m ® ksen f er sta « ed .

These had been that the Shah had personally assured Bis Majesty's Minister in the pre sence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Salar's life was safe if he sub mitted and did not resist the Government, that if he did not wish to go to iVihran His Majesty would give him a Governorship but not on the frontier, that when he felt re-assured be could return to Tehran, but that if he resisted the consequences would rest with him ; he could not expect the same Governor ship and he had better go with a few men to the Persian camp where he would find the two Corsuls, adding that Persian troops would escort him to his new Governorship. Tlie Minister now added that Salar could expect no help from the British and Russian Legations unless he submitted. I had previously received a telegram stating that by submitting Bis imperial Highness would establish a right to the protection of the two Governments. Interests now turned again to local affairs: on the 12th of June the Minister informed me that Atabeg and the Assembly had sent telegrams through him to Mehdi promising him safety and a full enquiry either at Tehran or at Hamadan. I was to tell Mehdi that he had better accept the offer and leave the Consulate. In answer Mehdi asked for two days' grace, his object being to get the enquiry held at Kermanshah and he and his party were expecting messengers to reach Tehran to push for that point. Their efforts were successful for later Zahir-ed-Houleh, the Governor of Hamadan, was ordered to Kermanshah to enquire into matters. In the meantime matters with Salar-ed-Douleh had progressed. He had moved to within six miles of IS eh a vend leaving a party at Khawa for the reception of the two Consuls whom he still believed to be coming to his camp. On the 9th of June a battle took place be tween Sa^ar's troops and these of the Amir Afkham who was garrisoning Nehavend. Salar assured me later that he was awaiting a letter from me, that the affair arose out of a skirmish between two parties while he was asleep, and that he was awakened to find that a battle had commenced against bis orders. This sounds like the truth for he did not seem anxious to come to blows, the reason for which I understood later. The battle having commenced Salar hurried to the spot and bringing up his artillery opened fire on the town. There had been a certain amount of imer- course between the two armies—if one can call them such—and the chief of Salar's artillery had been .privately warned that if .hostilities took place and he fired straight, he would have his head cut off later. He apparently did not believe in the prospects of Salar for though he fired fifty-two shots he hit nothing ; unfortunately he did not gain by his action for Saiar galloped up to him and having shot him dead fired two shots, which he aimed himself, which struck the walls of the city. Zahir-ed-Douleh congratulated himself greatly later on this piece of politique by which he was certain he had avoided great losses. Salar's Lurs were gaining steadily when Daood Khan arrived from Sehna with 1,500 of his Kalhur sowars and speedily put another complexion on affairs. Salar drew off and retired towards Khurramabad. This battle occurred on the very day on which the letter written by the Russian Acting-Consul and myself should have reached His Imperial Highness, but owing to the fight it was not delivered and was finally returned to me. On receiving it back I telegraphed the fact to the Minister, with new s of the affair which had occurred. On the 13th June I received orders to send a second copy of my former letter to Salar promising him as before pardon for his actions and a Governor ship if he submitted. This letter was sent off the same day. As can be imagined with the state of the tow n &amp;nd the rebellion of Salar- ed-Houleh the country around was in a most unsett ed condition and robberies were rife. I had five robberies at the Consulate during the month, and on the 13th a rifle was actually stolen from out of the bed of one of the escort while he was sleeping. On the 14th the climax was reached ; parties of men came to the high ground on either side of the Con sulate and fired into the Consulate grounds50 'ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY below, amongst the refugees. The Governor pretended that the refugees h 1 done this themselves in order to throw the hlame on their opponents but tb contention was quite impossible for the bullets went far too near inhabitel tents, and the wonder was how no one was hit. ea On reporting this I receivrd a telegram from the Legation that I authorised to haul down the British flag from the Consulate and move to the Bank if I considered that there was any danger to myself. I was, however quite convinced that the movement was directed solely against the refugees and so did not take action in the matter. Bullets were so constantly flying about in the town that as far as that was concerned it did not make much difference the difficulty was to understand as stated above how no one ever seemed to get hit* The Persian Government and the local Governor apologised for the inci- dent and the strictest orders were issued to the latter informing him that he was personally responsible for the safety of the Consulate. The refugees now stated that if they were fired on under the protection of the British flag what would be their condition outside and unprotected. They absolutely refused to leave sanctuary. On the 18th I received a letter from Nazr Ali Khan, ^aih-i-Lashkar, the father-in-law of Salar-ed-Douleh and chief of his forces to the effect that he was ready to accept any Governor for Luristan except Mujir-es-Sultaneh who was being sent there but that if that official were sent he prayed that at any rate Bakhtiari guards be not sent with him, since they were the hereditary foes of the Lurs. If the Bakhtiaris were sent he said that he would take to the hills and his former life of brigandage. He asked that the British should bring about a reconciliation for him with the Persian Government. I telegraphed the above to Tehran but his claims were not allowed and he fulfilled his promise and returned to his old habits. Subsequently a force was sent asrainst him but apparently without result for at the close of the year Nazr Ali Khan seized the town of Khurramabad while the Governor to whom he had objected took refuge in the house of the Imam-i-Juraa. The punitive expedition seemed to have, in the meantime, vanished into space and I never heard of it again. On receiving this letter from Fath-i-Lashkar I came to the conclusion that Salar-ed-Douleh had thrown up the sponge but I was extremely surprised, when, the following morning, I was informed that Salar-ed-Douleh was in the Consulate and had been there for the past three hours. At first I took it for granted that he had come in to accept the terms which had been offered him through me and in conversation I made reference to the details of the letter which I had sent him. I suppose that Zahir-ed- Douleh had offered him similar terms from the Pe rsian Govt-mment direct, for he answered my reference quite naturally and it \&gt;as not till the letter returned, having followed Salar a complete round Khurramahad, that I discovered that he had not received my second letter also. Salar-ed-Douleh made various demands all of which I forwarded to His Britannic Majesty's Minister; amongst other things he wrote saying that he wished to leave Persia and to settle in an English dependency. I did not imagine that the British Govern ment would be particularly anxious to provide a home for such a firebrand but forwarded on his letters. Minister wired me that the cabinet was debating what was to he done With His Imperial Highness and later that it was most undesirable that he should remain at the Consulate. On receipt of this latter telegram I persuaded Salar to accept the terms that had been offered him and to hand Jhimself over to Zahir-ed-Douleh; before, however, I could telegraph this to ienran I received a telegram that at a meeting of the Assembly it had been decided that Salar should be handed over to the Persian Government and I was accordingly instructed to hand him over to Zahir-ed-Dowleh. I sent for the latter the same evening, the 22nd of June, and handed over His Imperial Hignness by night in order to save him the indignity of passing through the streets by day. Thus the incident closed.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907- 57 On the 1st July Salar-ed-Douleh left Kermanshah for Tehran accom panied by Saif-ed-Douleh, the Governor, and Zahir-ed-Douleh, Governor of Hamadan, was appointed to act in the latter's place. Zahir-ed-Douleh had arrived on the 20th June as Commissioner to enquire into the state of affairs at Kermanshah. On the evening of his arrival he came to the Consulate to see the refugees but did not come up to visit me as he did not wish to meet Salar-ed-Dowleh. He persuaded Agha Mahommed Mehdi and others to leave the Consulate and then went to the Telegraph Office, where certain of the aristocratic party had taken 'bast' and induced them also to go to their homes. Having accomplished this he telegraphed to Tehran that not a soul was left in ' bast in either places. This was a piece of oriental phraseology for as a matter of fact the whole of the heads of the various trades and their folio wings, being about three-fourths of the total refugees, refused to leave till they had received some pledge through me and did not quit the Consulate till two days later. Thus the refugees having left on the morning of the 22nd Jure and Salar-ed-Douleh on the evening of the same day, I was considerably freer than I had been for some time past. Zahir-ed-Douleh was now confirmed in his appointment. He told me that when he visited Salar-ed-Douleh's camp the latter had not above 1,000 men, badly armed and clothed, some even without either arms or clothirg. His Imperial Highness was apparently a great believer in bluff in which he succeeded to a certain degree. He ga^e out that he had lO.OOu men with him in the hills and I do not think that even the i'ersians knew quite how many men could be raised in l.uristan. Sa 1 ar's object was not to fight but either to frighten his brother into giving him the governorships which be wanted or else to attract to his standard the local tribes and thus increase his strength to the point required before taking the field. The chief mi&gt;take he made was in that he imagined that his personality attracted others like that of Napoleon or Nadir Shah, to both of whom he frequently compared himself. He had correctly gauged the political situation, he knew that the Shah would not deal fairly with the Constitution and that there would be great distrust of him ; he therefore proposed himself taking the side of the Constitution and so gaining the people's affection for himself. Had he had another character, had he been of a more honest nature there is little doubt that he would have had an opportunity which would have with good management brought him very near that unstable and undesirable seat, the throne of Persia. If Salar had obtained the four Governorships for which he asked, there is equally little doubt that his idea was to so strengthen his position 1 —he had already allied himself by marriage to several of the chief tribes including that of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh—that he could on opportunity arising attempt by force that which he was now endeavouring to attain by policy. The mistake he made w^as in imagining he had that which he has not—a character which by its own force surmounts all difficulties. To resume, Zahir-ed-Douleh had now turned his attention to the work for which he had been appointed, namely the settling of the disputes between the two parties, the determining with whom lay the responsibility for looting the bazaar and in what manner the losses so incurred were to be repaid. It is curious thnt he did not succeed in fully gaining the confidence of the people for his sympathies were supposed to be very much with the progressive party. _ On the 12th August he held a meeting for the decision of certain points but it was not attended by any of the people's representatives, in fact on the previous day a large crowd had visited his residence and had roundly abused him while his attempts to pacify them were without result. In m Pantime the presence of Agha Mahommed Mehdi was required at Tehran in connection with the enquiry being made there also at the instance of the Assembly into the cause of the riots. A large number of people doubtful of Zahir-ed-Douleh's assurances had proceeded to Tehran and had induced the members of the parliament to take up a separate enquiry.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Mebdi accordingly left for that place under circumstances explained to me by Zabir-ed-Douleh as follows after much conversation Mehdi agreed to go as required, he was to travel in a carriage supplied by Government and stipulated that he should go without an escort as otherwise it might be said that he was being sent as a prisoner. Mehdi then demanded that iii s departure should be kept secret lest the people should prevent his going; he accordingly was to go to his brother's village and from thence to Hamadau where a carriage was to meet him. The above was all agreed to and Agba Mehdi was given 500 Tumans for his expenses, which money was borrowed from the Bank. Mehdi disappeared and a few days afterwards was stopped at Kasr-i. Shirin on the frontier where he had arrived without a passport and was consequently unable to cross into Turkey. Zahir-ed-Douleh was astonished Mehdi wired him tbat he had confidence in him as a Governor and as his own presence was not needed he had decided to sro to Kerbela and devole himself to religion and asked for a passport to leave the country. The question was referred to the Atabeg who permitted him to cross the frontier, Zahir-ed-Douleh remarked that it was the best thing as he was now out of the way and his flight would discredit him with the people. I did not discover till quite recently that the whole tiling was again a piece of ' haute politique.' Zabir-ed-Douleh had played on the fear of Mehdi had persuaded him that it was unwise to go to Tehran and had given him the' funds to escape, thinking that he would thus get rid of a man who stood in the way of bis settling matters as he desired. Atabeg's death created, as may be supposed, considerable stir but no disturbances occurred. For the next month things continued in the same state, the Governor making enquiries and evolving suggestions. Both parties remained on the defensive but discontent gradually began to arise again, as nothing definite was decided. Zahir-ed-Douleh finally placed a scheme before the Majlis by which Salar-ed-Douleh was made responsible for most of the losses since it was to his various inflammatory letters that the troubles were ascribed, Saif-ed-Douleh was made responsible for part and the remainder was variously divided. The suggestion was not approved and so the situation advanced no further. At the beginning of October a notice was put up in a chief street leading off the main square to the effect that unless the Governor did something for those who had been looted in the summer he would be killed by a member of a band of ten men who had banded themselves together for the purpose. The country around became most unsettled; the Governor attempted to eschew despotic methods. Much as one's sympathy lay with him in the attempt it was predestined to failure. In a country in which there are no methods of constitutional government, no laws by which to regulate the course of events, no police to enforce order it is hopeless to attempt to govern without a show of force. In such a country it is necessary to rule by fear. A man like Zahir-ed-iJouleb, led away by the appearance of foreign cities which he has seen from the outside and of the working of which he has no idea, imagines that the absence of tyranny and the apparent calm aye automati cally the result of civilisation. He does not realise the force which is always present behind the law. It is easy to imagine then that in a country like xersia Zahir-ed-Douleh's methods produced a condition of unsafetv which was worse than any thing which had preceded it. I ascribe it solely to the instability of rule in this country that tilings were not worse than they were or it was never certain that Zahir-ed- Douleh would not be dismissed and a stronger man put in his place who would tal&lt;e a reckoning: from the causers ot disturbance. a ^ er Prince Zafar-esrSultaneh was appointed Commander-in- rz 0 forces of Western Persia, He made Azam-ed-Douleh, son of Zanir-el-Mulk, the head of the Zengineh tribe, chief of the forces at Jiermansnah, and in the letter officially noting the appointment was a marginal note saying that the latter was not to take up the appointment till he had paid the 2,000 Tumans agreed upon as the price of the post.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 59 On the 9tb October Zahir-ed-Douleh was dismissed from the Governorship and Saif -ed-Douleh was re-appointed. The settlement of the troubles caused by the riots at Kermanshah had occupied the time of the assembly at Tehran and it was decided that Saif-ed-Douleh was to return, was to pay the value of the goods lost in the looting and was to recover the amount from those who were to blame. The appointment, or its terms, did not please the notables of Kermanshah who had benefited considerably and who did' not want to be made to pay especially those who were in command of regiments. Zahir-ed-Douleh was reappointed Governor of Hamadan but refused to leave till he had been paid for the period of his Governorship of Kermanshah. On the 22nd of October a considerable amount of firing took place immediately behind the Consulate and within 100 to 300 yards of it. The Consulate guard turned out and troops came up from the Kadkhuda of the Mohalla but by this time those concerned had moved off towards the north, skirting the town and continuing their firing. Shots fell in the Turkish Consulate-General and the Telegraph Office while several ricochets passed over the Consulate but without striking it. Two days after, a shot from the town passed over the Consulate going very near Mr. Manson of the Bank who was standing on the roof. There is little doubt that the object of the attack—an attack on nothing in particular—was to make the Consul report on the unsettled state of the country since the appointment of Saif-ed-Douleh had been announced. On the 25th there was a quarrel between a Mahomedan and a servant of the Alliance Israelite. The latter, who w r as not to blame, was re-inforced by the Sarbazes of the guard at the Alliance and by a Mahomedan servant. In the further quarrel that resulted a servant of the brother of the Imam-i-Juma hit one of the Sarbazes who took him into the court of the Alliance Israelite for punishment. Monsieur Sagues, in charge of the Alliance at Kermanshah, hearing of the matter came out and ordered the man to be released and asked the Imam Juma to enquire into the matter. Before this could be done the crowd had heard of the affair and pouring into the house of the Alliance Israelite seized Monsieur Sagues, accusing him of having insulted the Mahomedan religion, dragged him to the Musjid-i-Juma. He was there threatened with death but was saved by the Imam-i-Juma who arrived at the critical moment. A few days afterwards Monsieur Sagues arrived at the British Consulate saying that he had certain information that the Jewish quarter was to be raided on the Iloz-i-Katl. It turned out that Monsieur Sagues was a Turkish subject and so I had to send him to the Turkish Consul-General. Monsieur Mcolsky had informed me that he protected Trench interests sol told M. Sagues to address him on account of the Alliance. Neither of these two officers were particularly pleased at being appealed to by the Jews and it was fortunate for M. Sagues that I received a telegram from tur Minister saying that we protected the Alliance in company with the French, otherwise I fear the unfortunate Jew would not have received much protection. The Karguzar gave me a letter promising the safety of the JeWish quarter, for which he is responsible, and Monsieur Sagues returned to his home. On the 15th November Zahir-ed-Douleh was reappointed Governor of Kermanshah, on hearing which the people took 'bast ' at the Telegraph Office as they had understood that Saif-ed-Douleh was being sent back expressly because he had been Governor when the town was looted and was therefore according to Persian ideas responsible for whatever took place during his period of rule. On the 22nd November, however, two Commissioners arrived from Tehran, one appointed by the Department of Justice and one by the members of the Assembly. They were originally intended to see that Saif-ed-Douleh fulfilled his promises but now turned their attention to the re-appointed Governor. The people's party increased in power and the militia which had been raised commenced its drills.00 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Suleiman Mirza, a young prince possessed of some eloquence, speedily ca to the front and was one of the chief leaders of the popular party in subseqiw local politics. He began to deliver anti-foreign speeches in connection w^th the Anglo-Russian agreement but they were not well received and he did at continue. He finally had to leave Kermanshah accused of being a Babi. Zahir-ed-Douleh had now married his daughter to the grandson f Zahir-el-Mulk and his warmth [towards the popular party began to decrea complaints were general and it was openly stated that if he did not himself take bribes like other Governors his agents undoubtedly did so and that V apathy was worse than the rapacity of an ordinary Hakim. The two Commissioners from Tehran warned him that he had been special! re-appointed because he had said that he would recover the money due to th people and that if he did not propose to fulfil his promise he had bette 6 resign his appointment. On this Zahir-ed-Douleh by a private arrangement with them imprisoned the chiefs of all the local regiments including his new relations by marriage. That is to say they were imprisoned by day 5 and went home at night returning the following morning. He also imprisoned the three Kadkhudas of the Mahalias involved. This farce did not last long hut the Governor promised that all the money should be paid within ten davs and opened a public subscription ! On the 7th day perceiviDg the hopelessness of his position he departed by moonlight. His wife and family had left a dav or two previously on account of the illness of a daughter at Tehran, a fact which had given rise to a certain amount of suspicion. Thus once again Kermanshah was without a Governor and as no one was appointed from Tehran Zahir-el-Mulk, chief of the Zangineh tribe, took over the charge of the town and was confirmed latter as Deputy-Governor. The new ruler returned to ancient methods of cutting off limbs, et cetera and governing by fear. However much this may shock humanity, it stands to reason'that the form of Government must be suited to the civilisation of the people to be governed havinsr also regard to the means at hand to enforce order. To cut off one man's head for highway robbery is more humane than to allow, by weakness of Government, the murder of twenty innocent citizens. The town became quiet and continued so. Zahir-el-Mulk informed the militia that he would be glad if they would cease drilling while he was Deputy-Governor and also asked the local assemblies of which many had sprung up, to refrain from sitting as he did not understand new ways. After a little, however, telegrams began to arrive in connection with affairs at Tehran. The council at Tabriz wired that after his want of faith with the Constitution they could no longer recognize the Shah as ruler, the local assembly of Ispahan followed suit and soon the Kermanshahis were being earned along on top of the wave of disaffection. Moin-ur-Raya, a former shining light of the aristot'ractic party, made a speech saNingitwas the duty ©f the town to raise cavalry seize the guns and march to Tehran to the assistance of the Assembly. Ihe Shah, however, soon gave way and on the failure of his coupdetat telegrams were received from Tehran and most of the larger cities saymg that misunderstandings had been removed and all should give thanks to bod The Ispahanis added that the Shah had been misled by evil men and was not to blame. J It will be seen that the telegraph has given a cohesion to the papular party which could not otherwise have been obtained, news would have taken weeks to filter through and it would have been impossible without it to produce the rapidity of action required. At Kermanshah it was considered that after several large cities had openly expressed their intention of throwing off their allegiance to the Shah it would be very difficult for him to remain in his present position. The militia commenced their parades once more and the Governor made no objection. T. th i ^ ) ^ ce ^ er t wo telegrams arrived from people, one from ikb # Pazl Ullah of Tehran saying that the Majlis was against the Shara r religious law, the other from the Majlis warning the people against SheikhAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR mi-im. Fazl Ullah. Mujtahid Kamal-ud-Din of Kermanshali called a meeting of the people and read to them the two above telegrams and also a telegram from the chief Mujtahids of Kerbela winch stated that the Majlis was fully in accordance with the Shara and that any one in opposition to it was an unbeliever. This decree had the value of a Papal Encyclical. The Imam-i-juma rose and made a speecli pointing out that it was at Kerbela alone that a decision on such a subject could be given and that whatever the spiritual heads of the religion at that place should order must be obeyed. A telegram was accordingly sent to the Majlis offering them the full support of the town and to Sheikh Pazl Ullah disassociating themselves from his movement. The Legation now telegraphed to me that the Shah had given his promise to the English and Russian representatives that he would faithfully observe the Constitution. I was to be permitted to use this news to calm the people if I considered it necessary. As the people's party seemed predominant and there appeared no fear of a collision I did not use the information. On the 2nd January Asrha Mahomed Mehdi, the religious chief of the people's party, who had taken refuge in the Consulate in the summer and who had fled to Kerbela in the autumn, returned to Kermanshah fully accredited by the Mujfcahids of Kerbela. He had a great reception and a do^en C{ yedaq horses (riderless and highly decorated and saddled horses usually sent out as a sign of honour) were sent out to meet him, amongst them being one from the Governor and one from the Karguzar. The people went out in thousands and kissed Mehdi's hands and feet and even the feet of his horse. Mehdi now pretends to great absorption from the world and abstention from temporal affairs. He is, however, the religious chief of the local assembly. On the 11th January Zahir-el-Mulk, who had been appointed Commander- in-Chief of the forces on the frontier, left for Kasr-i-Shirin and Azam-ed-Douleh, his son, took over the post of Deputy-Governor, He immediately began to act with great harshness and continued his father's policy of force : unfortunately he appeared to be indifferent whether he punished the innocent or the guilty and subsequently suffered for his mis- government and has been deprived of all his titles and honours. During the time he was Deputy-Governor, i .e., to the end of the year, he made a good deal of monev, especially out of the charwardars. An order came from Tehran for bidding Persian charwardars crossing the frontier. Azam-ed-Douleh worked this order for his own benefit by forbidding the transport of any merchandise to the frontier at all unless he were irst bribed. No further open conflict took place as the people's party were too- strong and, in addition, frontier matters took up the time of the official classes. At the same time, strong as is the people's party, it seems impossible that the large numbers who will lose their means of existence under a constitutional Government, including all the official classes and their hangers on, will consent to their losses without a fight. The actual strength would appear to be ou their side fo^ none of the tribes have any sympathy with constitutional means. Thus when vested interests are seriously attacked, should the movement at Tehran show any signs of strength, they will find a very strong and numerous backing in the Kermansharh district;. No movement is however likely to , originate in Kermanshah though it would be a bold man who would prophesy about anything in this country. dispute ^ the beginning of October I received information that the Turkish rd m ' troops were being increased all along the frontier. ^is- At Kermanshah it is most difficult to get reliable information and I was- several times misled after having confirmed most carefully the news that I had received. I accordingly asked for permission to proceed to Kasr-i-Shirin, where I spent two months of the winter from the middle of January to the middle of March.

I, mounted on mules. 3 guns with 45 artillerymen and 28 horses. 80 mule loads and 50 camel loads of military stores and ammunit The Turks claim the districts of Zohab and Saumar. Regarding Zohab Sir Henry Rawlinson says ' It formed one of the 11 Pashaliks dependent upon Baghdad until about sixty years ago (i .e., beginning of 19th century) when Mahommed Ali Mirza, Prince of Kermanshah, annexed it to the crown of Persia. By the treaty concluded between Persia and the Porte in 1823 it was stipulated that the districts acquired by either party during the war should be respectively surrendered and that the ancient frontier line should be restored which had been established in the time of the Satfavi monarchs. According to a subsequent, treaty Zohab ought certainly to have been given up to the Turkish authorities, but neither had the Persians the will to render this act of justice nor had the Pasha of Baghdad the power to enforce it and Zohab has thus remained to the present day in the possession of the Government of Kermanshah. It is commonly stated in Kermanshah that the father of the present 'Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh acquired the district of Saumar by conquest from the Turks. The Turkish Consul-Genera] remarked to me one day that if a man has property of yours and you are strong enough to take it Irom him il: he will not give it up you naturally take it by force. Having regard to the preparations made, especially in ammunition and material, it would seem the natural course of events that the Turks should await till the question of these two provinces comes before the Frontier Com mission and then, should there be any dispute about the matter, that they should insist by force on what they consider to be their rights. I have, throughout the year, been employed with the affairs of the Imperials Bank of Persia, which still continues in a most unfortunate state owing to jthe defalcations of Mirza Ismail Khan Pakir, formerly the book keeper of the Bank. It appears that blank signed cheques were left in the hands of the book-keeper who did ali the work and was virtually manager of the Bank, since his signature was sufficient for loans, etc. The natural consequence was that being without supervision he took advantage of the unfortunate trust placed in him, indeed what else could be expected of a Persian. Ismail Khan needed capital for his own adventures and took it from the Bank under the form of loans to various persons. He also gave loans to all and sundry taking as security property, which is against the charter of the Bank, consequently most of the loans are unsecured. What is still more unfortunate is that he had large numbers of private transactions and both Bank and private transactions are made out in the name of s&lt; Ismail Khan Bakir , Mudir-i-Bank. ,, The resulting confusion can be imagined and, although the Bank books show which transactions belong to the Bank, it can be understood that the Persian debtor attempt to deny that he owes money to the Bank at all or brings up receipts which concerned private matters and attempts to set them off against Bank claims. The situation is then at best a complicated one : add to this the fact that throughout the year Governments have changed with a kaleidoscopic rapidity and it will be ssen that the recovery of money by force from a recalcitrant debtor was practically a matter of impossibility. Since the beginning of the year under report, however, we have succeeded in getting in a good many payments and matters have assumed a more hopeful form, though there is still much to recover. The year has been an exceptionally dry one, the total rain falling amount ing to 18*03 inches. On one day, only, did snow worth mentioning fall with the result that what are usually rushing streams until the month oi June areAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 19Q7-1908. 03 now drv beds, while many spriogs which generally last till the heat of summer are also dry or at best have but a small triclde. JFortunately rain fell at the proper seasons for tbe crops of 1908 and thus no great harm has been done beyond tbat, owing to the varm winter, there is hardly any ice stored for next summer. The crops w ere very good and the price of wheat varied from 8 tomans before the reaping to 35 kracs the kliarwar after it, while at the present time it can be bought in Gnran for 20 krans, but would not pay to bring in : barley fell to 14 krans the kharwar. I bought it this year at 20 krans while the previous year I had paid 60 krans, though arriving late and buying at the wrong season. The revenue of the Kermanshahan Proyince is as follows :— Cash.

The revenues of Kermanshahan are mainly used up in pensions to Shahzadas, to Mullahs of Kermanshahan and Nejef, and in the pay of the four regiments and contingents of sowars. The following figures will prove the truth of my contention that British Trade * trade on the Kermanshah route is far from being in a moribund condition, indeed that it only needs fostering to swamp the market. British goods have the best name of any except in goods of a turkey red ground where the dye is n0t fast * 1905-1906. 1906-1907. 1907-1908. £ £ £ Total Imports . • • 745,674 1,014,336 1,240,445 From United Kingdom . • 507,335 725,321 9 ^ From India . . . . 74,855 86,262 156,294 While these figures are very satisfactory they are not absolutely correct: they show rather the country from which the goods have been ordered than the actual country of origin and I regret to say that much which comes through Bombay agents and which is shown as either from the United Kingdom or India has in reality its origin in a foreign country ; this applies more especi- allv to woollen goods. I am attempting to get merchants to dt al direct and thus avoid this condition of affairs ; for this, however, I must reside m Hamadan for some time and 1 propose doing so this summer if the state of the country permits. 1 am indeed inclined to think that His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kermanshab, should spend at least four months, if not six months, of the year at that place ; the two towns are so near each other that if his presence were required in the other at any time it would be very easy to make the necessary visit. I have also held the opinion that the Imperial Bank of Persia should reverse its present system and should have its branch ( fiice at Hamadan with an A gent at Kermanshah. Both Mr. Messervy, the Inspector, who lately visited Kermanshah and the present manager are in agreement with this idea and the latter asked me to go into it with the heads of the Bank should 1 visit lehran as I intended. The reasrn for this is obvious ; Kermanshah has not one-fifth the trade of Hamadan, which is the distributing centre for Noith-'West Persia, and the Kermansbah merchants and bankers are really, with rare exceptions, but agents for the Baghdad or the Hamadan wholesale importers.

ADMINISTEATION REPORT OP THE KERMAN CONSULATE EOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. The personnel of the British Consulate was unchanged during the year. British con- The Russian Consulate was strengthened in October 1907 by the arrival Russian con- of Mr. Petroff as Secretary to the Consul. Before his arrival he was frequently sulate * referred to as the coming Vice-Consul but on arrival was introduced in his proper capacity of Secretary, the first grade of their Consular service. The experiment of leaving a boy of nineteen to govern the Kerman Local poiitica. district with practically nothing behind him resulted as was only to be expected. He exercised a nominal rule in Kerman itself for some months, while in the districts his rule was not even nominal, the districts after the departure of the Perman Eerma going steadily to pieces. In Kerman itself one Mohamad Husain, the Nazim-ut-Tujjar, with a Naib of Earrashes named Haji Ibrahim started a popular propaganda with an agitation for the immediate election of the local Majlis. When they first started the agitation the Tehran Parliament had not passed the necessary Acts, and when the Acts were passed they did not meet with the approval of the Nazim and the Naib. Their following being almost entirely composed of the rifP-raff of the town and the artisans, they objected to the other five classes having the same number of representatives each on the Majlis, and claimed that as the labouring classes formed half ot the population of the town they should ^ elect six members out of the twelve and the other five classes the remaining six between them. Relations between them and the Governor soon became strained, and they were soon both enjoying the hospitality of the British Telegraph Office under the peculiarly Persian institution of bast.' Erom this safe position they pressed the point strongly against the Governor, and with true Persian egotism even wired to the Tehran Parliament to amend the Act with reference to Kerman. The Parliament not unnaturally refused to do this and telegraphed to the Governor to ibeize the Nazim and send him up to Tehran. The Governor brought the telegram to me and asked my advice. I told him that I considered any attempt to seize the Nazim alone would be fatal and even if he could seize both the Nazim and the INaib it would be very risky. All the telegrams to him had come over the Persian wires and ^vere therefore distrusted by the people. I advised him to bring the point to a €lear issue between the Parliament and the Nazim and Naib and to get his orders over the British wires, so that the people should not be able to accuse him of tampering with them but would clearly understand that the Nazim and Naib were defying the Central Government and not the local Governor. The Governor, however, went his own way, and managing to lure the Nazim out of ' bast' seized him and hurried him out of the town. Ihe Naib immediately gathered the whole following, closed the bazars and organised an attack on the palace. The small force in the palace shut the gates and fired on the mob killing five and wounding several more. The Naib and the mob then paraded at the British Telegraph Office with the victims and all went into ' bast.' The next morning the victims were a&gt;ain paraded before the Russian Consulate and a certain amount of violent language used to the Russian Consul, they were then again taken to the Telegraph Office and photographed. At this point the other current joined in and the stream became too strong for the young Governor and swept him out of Kerman. The Mirza of the Russian Consulate, the Amin-ul-Islam, had a private grudge against the Prince because the Eerman Eerma had treated him as the low-caste individual that he is and refused to accept his position in the Russian Consulate as any claim to social recognition in the palace. The Sheikhi Khans had been pressed by the Governor to open up their stores of wheat and sell it at a price which represented an actual loss to them, and they had been long waiting for their revenge on the Deputy-Governor—the Adil-es-Saltaneh—ior the anti-Sheikhi0g ADMINISTEATIQN REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULE POLITICAL RESIDENCY riots of three years ago. Tbey knew that the Eussian Consul's relations with the Governor were more than strained, and that they would have hissvmpath if not his active help, and considered that their opportunity had com? They accordingly put themselves at the head of the movement and carried half the mob over to the Bussian Consulate, the Amin-ul-Islam being mos |. active in this and offering the people all they wanted if they would leave the British Telegraph Office and go over to the Russian Consulate. The Russian Consul made a poor pretence of joining me in tryino' t 0 reconcile the two parties, but was largely coerced and partly voluntaiily 0 i e ^ to side with the popular party who then refused to be satisfied with the dismissal of the Deputy-Governor, but insisted on the dismissal of the Governor as well. They got their way, and the Governor was re-called to Tehran. The Nazim was brought back to the town in triumph, and though there has been a nominal Deputy-Governor in Kerman and several nominations and cancellations of Governors by the Persian Government, the Nazitn and the I^aib have since then ruled the Kerman city to all intents and purposes. They at once elected a local Majlis according to their own emendation of the Act of Parliament, but the Majlis has not been particularly happy either in its internal harmony or outside confidence. The general anarchy throughout the district, resulting from the absence of any central authority in it, dislocated all business and reduced the value of carpets by 50 per cent.; carpets heino- the chief industry of Kerman and the Nazim's following being chiefiy composed of the workers in it he has naturally lost most of his popularity with his own followers. He and the Naib have managed to offend the Julias, the merch ants, the respectable classes generally and the sarbazes and every one of them has had it brought home personally to them that any authority is better than none at all. The Sheikhi Khans have found that the many-headed is also the many-mouthed and as neither the Nazim or the Naib started with any money in their possession the expense of keeping these mouths satisfied devolved on them and they are thinking that the game was not worth the candle. The Russian Consul gained a small temporary popularity largely mingled with contempt which is more than effaced now and he must be ^orry that he did not show a bolder front and take a longer view than he did. This Consulate is now reaping the reward for maintaining a correct attitude towards both sides and it is recognised with respect that neither iutimidation nor personal feeling will make a British Consul disregard his orders and tUat he only receives one set of these. The Districts. Except under an unusually strong Governor-General like the Eerman Ferma,^ Baluchistan has never been much more than nominally a Persian possession or paid much respect to Persian authority, but the Persian hold on it has never been so feeble as it is just now. Early in the year a young chief who resented a^ fraudulent re-sale by the Governor of his ancestral fort which he had only just purchased himself from the Governor held it with only a dozen followers against the Persians, shooting a Sartip and about twenty men. By way of vindicating Persian authority the Governor retreated to Bampur and then resigned his Governorship and lett Baluchistan. After a considerable interval, another Governor was appointed and^ after a protracted further delay, he actually went to Baluchistan. He stayed for a short time practically in a state of siege in his fort and then returned to Bam. Another chief, turned aa honest penny by collectiug the customs at one of the ports, but unfortunately for himself found that this brought him iuto collision with outside authorities. Otherwise the Baluchis have been surprisingly quiet and have neither fought among themselves nor raided into Narinashir or neighbouring districts. In Narmashir there has been a good deal of conflict between the popular party and the Khans. The local Anjuman in B im seem to have t :| ken up as uncompromising an attitude as the Majlis itself and will stand no opposition trom the Governors whom they turned out on the slightest provocation. Iu the case of the Nasr-ul-Mamalik they pulled down his house and burned everything tney could lay hold of in it. The sarbazes sided with the Khans for a long time and there have been several conflicts between the sarbazes and the people, but the popular party have at last won over the sarbazes and- this has left the re-actionaries without a backing and they have had to. subscribe to the constitution.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. Rudbar has been upside down throughout the year. The Governor who was there was chased out and the man who succeeded him has been a non entity when there and has not been there for the greater part of the time. In the meantime the Khans of Rudbar has been raiding into .Pais and tihe Arabs and Baharloos counter-raiding into Rudbar and parts of Jiruft and the villages are almost all deserted. Rafsinjan and Zarand have been no better off. The Farsis aided and directed by the Buchagchis have looted all along their borders and the Kerma- nis there are too weak to counter-raid or protect themselves. The Governor of Sirjan managed to shoot the chief of the Buchagchis during a Muharram service, but has only succeeded in starting a blood-feud between himself and the tribe. Bands of robbers have sprung up on every road and the posts have been robbed over and over again. Caravans have practically stopped moving except in bodies of several hundreds. The usual rice caravan from Shiraz arrived in Kerman escorted by 500 men, 300 of them armed with Martini rifles. The Kerman district on the whole has been, like the rest of Persia, in a state of anarchy and there does not seem to be much prospect of anything more than a slight improvement until the central government in Tehran really take a grasp of tilings. Under the circumstances it is not surprising that the postal service has been posts, irregular and more than usually uncertain. Parcels unless insured have no chance of escaping robbery either in the post or outside and even when insured they are not much more successful in getting through. Letters and papers mostly come through some time but quite promiscuously and very often open. There are no roads in the district and the apologies for them have been Communications, almost unused during the year, except the short track between Kerman and Yezd. No caravan left Bunder Abbas for Kerman from May to the end of December. The robbers have been in possession of all the tracks and donkeys and camels have been carried off within 3 miles of Kerman itself. The telegraph office in Kerman has become the transmitting station on the Telegraphs, main Indo-European route since the linking up of the line through Panjgur. The European staff has been considerably increased and now consists of an Assist ant Superintendent, clerk in charge, two signallers and an Inspector of the Divi sion. The much-needed line to Bunder Abbas has not yet been constructed. The Imperial Bank of Persia's branch here is flourishing under the able Bank, management of Mr. Simpson and has now got a European accountant. Mr. Simpson has succeeded in purchasing an excellent site abutting on the main bazar and is building new premises on it, the completion of which should largely increase the Bank's business. The Church Missionary Society hospital has continued to work but its Missionaries, management is unfortunately neither judicious nor popular and in place of being a help to my work has become a source of anxiety. I hope to effect a change in this matter. The other side of the Mission is more popular and if the school is not yet a large one, I think it is making as much progress as can be expected. Trade is dealt with in a separate report and I need here only say that in Trade, spite of all the difficulties the figures show an increase of some five lakhs of rupees on last year. The climate both in the summer and in the winter was milder than usual. Climate. There was very little snow in Kerman itself and the hills round,which usually have snow on them till June and July, will have none by the middle of May, The rain was very late in commencing and very scanty till just the end of the year, since when it has improved and promises now to continue later than usual and the prospects of the harvest are now good. The year under report has been politically full of incident and the want of any competent authority has made the work very anxious and difficult. In a short time now, however, we shall have a capable and experienced Governor again at the head of affairs and I hope the coming year will be less full of incident and more free from anxiety. C. DUCAT, Eis Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman,AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1807-1608. CHAPTER V- administration report of the bunder abbas consulate eor the year 1907-1908. The remarks made in last year's report regarding the general unrest General prevailing throughout the district, are equally pertinent to tbe conditions remarks - prevailing during the year under report. The constant recurrence of distur bances and the impunity with whioh raiding parties from Ears territorv committed depredations in the Bunder Abbas administrative district unchecked by the local authorities, tended to reduce to vanishing point the authorltv of the Deputy-Governor of Bunder Abbas and in the Shamilat his orders were openIv ignored Situated as he is at Bunder Abbas, with but a handful of tofanechis to uphold his authority, he is quite powerless to cope with lawlessness prevailing beyond the limits of the town. Nor is his position an enviable one in the town itselt, where he is every day becoming more and more the puppet of the local Assembly. It is inttresting to note that this Assembly was orWnaUv inaugurated with the object of founding a schcol for the education of Persian children. Having accomplished this end, its attention was gradually diverted by oadid-es-Sultaneh, the Russian Agent, to the discussion of local affairs in general and latterly it has not scrupled to interfere in administrative matters and to dictate to the local authorities. Although the Governor of the Gulf Potts has several times called upon the people of Bunder Abbas to elect a representative for the Bushire Assembly, nothing has been done in this direc- tion, the prominent inhabitants contenuing that the town and district is of sufficient importance to merit a separate representative in the Tehran Assembly. Owing to absence of rain, the crops were a total failure and the year aainfaii and has been characterised by great scarcity and want throughout the district. Harvest. ± odder was unobtainable locally and large quantities were imported from the upper Gulf. J - Mirza Abbas Khan, Amin-ul-Vzarha, held the dual appointment of 1^1 Deputy-Governor and Karguzar until the 26th November, when Mirza Ismael Authorities. Khan replaced him as Deputy-Governor. He continued, however, to hold the post or Karguzar throughout the year. In the Shamilat, Assadulla Khan displaced Mir Ahmed Shah in the Kalantarship, but after holding office for a few weeks, was dismissed. Subse- quent^, owmg to an agitation, particuiars of which ^re stated below, Assad^ Kalamars 11 Ahmed Shah were on July 5th appointed as joint At Lingah, Mahsood-ul-Mamalik was Deputy-Governor until the 17th October, when he was replaced by Safar All Khan. At Minab, Kerbelai Mahomed Hassan, who had always been most friendlv disposed and rendered us much assistance in dealing with cases involving -British interests, was replaced in the Deputy^Governorship early in June bv Hassan, Amin-i-Diwan. J Sheikh Saleh has been Zabit of Kishm throughout the vear. He paid 3 200 tomans for the revenue of the island, a reduction of 1,700 tomans on'the amount realised in former years. The year has, however, been one of great scarcity throughout the island, no rain having fallen. Fodder or grazing for camels has been unobtainable, with the result that hundreds of camels (5 krans per head revenue is derived from each camel) have been taken to the mainland and sold to Afghans. In all Sheikh Saleh maintains that he is some o,000 tomans out of pocket as the result of his year's term of office. ,, . At Hormuz, Mirza Khali! continued to represent the interests of the Moin-et-Tujjar. Taking advantage of the discontent prevailing amongst the Shamilat ryots, Dirturbano** by reason of the previous year's scarcity in the district, Mir Ahmed Shah, the dismissed Kalantar, raised an agitation against the newly appointed Ealantar,fjl ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCr Assadullab Khan, and brought about the latter s dismissal. Smarting under this injustice, Assadullah Khan and his adherents marched to Bunder Abbas and having failed to secure re-instatement, some 300 of Ms followers took &lt;{ bast' in the Consulate. The local authorities after some hesitation gave W ay and Assadullah Khan was re-appointed Kalantar. Jealous of the prestige accruing to the Consulate by reason of its having secured redress for the bastis, the Bussian Consul proceeded to engineer a counter-demonstration on behalf of Mir Ahmed Shah. About 150 of the latter's followers came to Bunder Abbas and having invoked the Russian Consul's aid were accommodated in the house of his Tehrani munshi. After further protracted indecision on the part of the local authorities, the Governor of the Gulf Ports arrived and settled the matter by appointing Assadullah Khan and Mir Ahmed Shah as joint Kalantars of the Shamilat. During the first three months of the year, the district to the west of Bunder Abbas was rendered unsafe owing to the depredations of Mulla Hashim, an adherent of the Deputy-Governor of Lar. In August, the Fargbun district was much disturbed, owing to hostilities between Ali Khan, Kalantar of Ahmedi, and the sons of the late Gharib Shah, Kalantar of Parshun. The dispute originated through both parties claiming the right to the Kalantarship of Earghun. M. Ovseenko, the Russian Consul, who was staying at Siahu* at the time, endeavoured to effect a settlement between the disputants, but was unsuccessful. After some bloodshed on both sides, the matter was settled by the appointment to the disputed Kalantarship of Mirza Hassan, a son of Hazi Ali Kuli Khan, the Deputy-Governor of Lar. Early in November, the Baharloo tribesmen, instigated it was said by the Kowam-ul-Mulk, who had been dismissed from office at Shiraz, rose and descending from Ears territory, committed vast depredations in the Bunder Abbas district. Scarcely a village escaped their attention and the town became inundated with pHnic-stricken villagers. By December nothing remained in the district upon which the desperacoes couid lay their hands and when Khamir on the Clarence Straits was attacked and rumour became strong that Bunder Abbas itself was their next objective, the local authorities besought aid from the Governor of Bu^hire. So threatening was the outlook that it became necessary to devise measures for the protection of the British subjects in the town and H. M. S. Lapwing airived as a precautionary measure. The prespnce of the gunboat restored confidence and deterred the raiders from a too near approach to the town; At this stage, the Governor arrived from Bushire with 120 sarbazes and two guns, which force was promptly despatched to Ginao to guard the pass. • The force remained in camp until early in January, when, with the disappearance of the raiders, it returned to Bushire. Caravan traffic. It is only natural that with the prevalence of disturbances such as those above enumerated, together with the lamentable state of the country generally, robberies of goods in eourse of transit were frequent, while, from time to time, the caravan tiaffic became completely paralysed. In September, a caravan was attacked in the Eudkhana Duzdi and eight British Indian subjects return ing from Meshed, were robbed of merchandise valued at 1,700 tomans. A few days later, the Persian post bags, en route for Kerman, were robbed near Doulatabad. Early in October, the news from the interior became so disquiet ing that caravan traffic was entirely suspended. This state of things continued until the end of Dt cember. In January the caravan traffic ^as resumed, but owing to the large accumulation of merchandise by reason of the previous inactivity, transport rates became exorbitant. The closing month of the year found the caravan routes again disturbed and robberies in the Shamilat were common. A so^ ar of the Kerman Consular Escort was robbed near Baghu of two donkey loads of personal property and up to date the local authorities have taken no steps to satisfy the resulting claim. Trade Repeated attempts to secure the return to Bunder Abbas from Lar of disabilities. the debtors who absconded in 1£06 have been unsuccessful, and the f still practised bv fraudulent debtors and others seeking to evade their liabi ties. In several instances, British Indian creditors have submitted to tte meagre terms offered by these debtors and have accepted a composition, ratherAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 73 than risk losing everything. The facility with which debtors can abscond and enjoy protection at Lar, remains a standing menace and deterrent to the Hindu trading commnnity and exercises a very disadvantageous influence on trade enterprise. The Persian trader refuses to engage in 'cash' transactions and inva riably wants credit. The consequence is that the British Indian trading com munity has no option but to sell on credit and risk non-payment, or to stop trading altogether. The Deputy-Governor has recently announced his intention of again collecting ' pierage.' Orders were issued by the Tehran authorities early in 1907 to discontinue the levy of this tax, but the local authorities seek to justify its re-imposition by stating that it is still included in the schedule of revenue to be recovered by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The matter is engaging the attention of the Eesidency and of His Majesty's Legation. The year has witnessed a general weakening of the authority exercised S^aSon admi ' bv the local Customs administration. This may perhaps be accounted for by M. Naus' departure from Tehran and the subsequent uncertainty regarding the continued employment of Belgian Directors and of the measure of support to be expected from head-quarters in enforcing the regulations. At Gatchin and Bostapa, on the Clarence Straits, Mulla Hashim, a protege of the Deputy- Governor of Lar, having first warned M. Wagner of bis intention, proceeded to intimidate the Customs representative and himself to collect the Customs dues, while at Kohistak, on the Biyaban coast, the Baluchis drove out the Customs employee and closed the post. All subsequent attempts to re-estab lish it proved fruitless until, towards the end of the year, the expedient of buying the services of Mir Birkat Khan, an influential Baluch Chief, achieved the desired result. M. Wagner, the local Director, proceeded on leave in June and was succeeded in turn by Moses Khan and M. Varren. The latter is a Swiss and is well disposed towards British interests. He was transferred to Lingah at the end of October, when Moses Khan was re-appointed to Bunder Abbas and has continued in office until the end of the year. With uncer tainty in their minds as to their position and prospects, it was not possible ^ for the Directors to evince anti-English sentiments and, as a result, relations between the Customs and the Consulate have been entirely devoid of friction or unpleasantness. In Minab, Mirza Karim, the Mudir who formerly gave us mfo so m uch trouble when acting in that capacity at Hen jam, maintained his bad reputation by imprisoning in his house a British-Indian subject against whom he had some claim. After repeated representations to the Customs Adminis tration, the Consulate has at last secured the dismissal of this truculent mudir. Steps have recently been taken to re-establish Customs posts at Charbar and !% Tank and a steam launch has been despatched to Charbar to assist the mudir, hut the Baluchis have ne\ er acquiesced in the establishment of these posts and it is thought that, as formerly, they will proceed to break them up again at re ' .g their leisure. Throughout the cold weather, large numbers of Pathans, prevented from Armstrafflo. landino- at Maskat. arrived by mail steamer and proceeded to purchase arms and ammunition from Lari traders. In the early months of the year, large consignments of arms had been smuggled ashore at the different ports On the Clarence Straits and conveyed thence to Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Deputy-Governor of Lar. On learning that a good price could be secured for rifles from the Pathans, large numbers were transported from Lar to Bunder Abbas and were iie] lere \ 0 \^ in the bazar almost under the eyes of the Customs authorities. The iP^j, procedure adopted was somewhat as follows -.—Having paid the trader for the number of rifles required, the Palhan proceeded to his encampment outside the town and prepared his camels for departure. In the evening, the Deputy- Governor's tofangchis, on receipt of a small commission, would proceed to cany jU# I rifles one by one to the Pathan, until the whole order was delivered. As , ar ^ tfce tofangchis habitually carry arms, no comment arose regarding this proce- J # ^ ure&gt; In other instances, Pathans arrived by steamer, purchased camels locally and then left without loads, proceeding to some previously selected spot on the IjiJ Biyaban coast, there to load up with arms and ammunition. The Customs ' , .jf authorities were kept informed of the existence of the illicit trade, but always J deferred taking action, the Director dreading to damage his popularity by JV making a raid upon the traders implicated. On the Biyaban coast, however,74 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY was recently Local enterprises. Telegraph. Slave manumission. Public health. the seizure of some 25 rifles and 30,000 rounds of ammunition effected. Large quantities of oxide of iron were shipped by Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.'s steamers up to the 31st TV ormuz oxi e. cember, after which, however, ships dis^ contmued their visits to the island. This fact has given rise to numerous rumours regarding the future disposal of the oxide. 13y some it is asserted that the Moin-et-Tujjar has terminated his contract with Messrs. Strick, while others say that the Persian Government has called into question the Moin's right to farm the island. The Moin's Agent has recently informed the Consulate, however, that the Tehran Assembly has ratified the concession originally obtained by the Moin from the Shah, Mr. Hamilton Gunn, the mining engineer alluded to in last year's report, . terminated his contract with the Mm'n' Kishm sulphur quarries. , m •• i '.in ^ -M-Oin- et-Tujjar and sailed for Europe on the 15th May. Since then the Moin has contemplated the construction of a trolley line from the quarries to the coast and also of large tanks for the storage of fresh water to supply the workers. ]t is understood, however, that these projects have now been abandoned and that it is intended to calcine the sulphur on the spot and without the aid of machinery, camel transport bein» employed between the quaries and the coast. In order to supervise this work, M. Benedetto, an Italian engineer, has been engaged and arrived from Europe on the 22nd January. Notwithstanding that M. Hatinoglou has several times written to Sponge Expjoratta Syndicate. acquaintances in Bunder Abbas, announc mg his early return to resume diving operations off the islands of Hormuz and Kishin, he has hitherto failed to put ' in an appearance. The Hamburg-America Line continued to be represented by Aga Ghulam German projects. Ali Kborassani, but he contemplates being replaced at an early date by a European representative of Messrs. Wonckhaus. Eleven German steamers called on the outward voyage, disembarking an aggregate of 5,434 packages and taking away 727 packages. At the end of January, M. Kurt Jung, Commercial Delegate from the German Eoreign Office, arrived from Kerman! During his stay, he devoted himself to a study of the local trade requirements with a view to promoting German trade interests with the port. During the year, four Russian steamers called on both outward and Russian trade. homeward voyages. That the visits of the?e steamers to tbe port are scarcely lucrative may be gathered from the fact that the aggregate number of packages brought by them for the year, was 1,130, while the number shipped was 1,017. JN o progress has been made towards a solution of the cable question and the wire has been open for the despatch of Consulate messages only. In June the telegraph clerk proceeded on leave, since when his duties have been effici ently discharged by the British Postmaster. The Persian guard remains posted at the end of the cable, while the three telegraph messengers are located in tents and watch the wire and cable-house on behalf of the Telegraph Depart ment. In December, the wire was severed in two places by some person unknown, but the damaged wire has since been entirely replaced. Of fugitive slaves who took refuge at the Consulate, 84 were granted manumission certificates, while 19 slaves who took refuge in the Agency at Lingah were also manumitted. Erom complaints made by several freed slaves, there is reason to apprehend that the petty chiefs of the Beyaban coast do not pay due regard to manumission certificates in their subsequent treatment of tie persons concerned. The district has been free from any serious epidemic. Small-pox was prevalent m Bunder Abbas during the earlier months of the year, but subsided when the populations left for the date plantations in May. Eighty-five persons were vaccinated at the charitable dispensary. Malaria fever has been more than usually prevalent.v AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 75 Early in May, some six or seven coolies working in the oxide quarries at calamities, Hormuz, were buried alive through an overhanging bank falling in on them.

The latter place by reason of its open situation and good water supply, atfords a welcome change from the oppressive climatical conditions of Bunder Abbas. Owing to the want of a seaworthy vessel, it was not possible to visit the Beya- ban coast and, as a result, inconvenience has several times been experienced through inability to establish friendly relations with the local Mirs. The disturbed state of the district prevented the journey being undertaken by land, while it was not considered advisable to risk a visit to the exposed shores of Beyaban in the small Consulate boat. For this purpose, as well as for paying periodical visits to Lin gab and the islands in this Consulate's jurisdiction, a small steam launch would be invaluable. The Arab regime on the island has enjoyed complete immunity from Henjam. Persian interference throughout the year and with the exception of the small Customs post and the flasstaif, both within the limits of our telegraph station, there is no visible sign of the Persian claim to sovereignty over the island.

Lawrence entered the port several times. The B. P. Surprise arrived in February and after leaving was obliged to put back with defects in her machinery. She eventually sailed for the Upper Gulf via the Clarence Straits. Monsieur G. Ovseenko, the Bussian Consul, continued to hold charge Russian throughout the \ear. In August he proceeded to Siahu, 40 miles to the north Consulafie - of Bunder Abbas, with the intention of remaining there until the end of the hot weather, but the heat coupled with the disturbances in the vicinity, compelled him to return early in September. Monsieur Belayew, Consular Assistant, proceeded to Bussia on the 22nd: December and his place was taken by M. Matthieu r said to be an officer of Cossacks, who had arrived on the ^th September. The Consular escort was relieved by the arrival of 10 Cossacks on board the S. S. Euphrates early in September, the relieved escort returning to the frontier md Kerman. The Sadid-es-Sultaneh and Mirza Assadulla Khan (known as 'the Sartip '*) have in turn represented Bussia at Lingah and both there and in Bunder Abbas have taken a leading part in the inauguration of the local Assemblies and in the direction of their deliberations. Mirza Abul Kasim, formerly in the employ of the Besidency, was for some 1 time on the Mekran Coast collecting information for the Bussian Consulate.. He also visited M-^skat, Lingah and the Pirate Coast,, but has not latterly been seen in Bunder Abbas. Lieutenant C. H.

In April 1907, Mir Barkat took over from Mir Haji one-fifth of the Biyaban district, embracing that portion of the coast between Kuh-Mubarak and Karai Creek, and it ■will be seen from the Arms Traffic Report, which follows, that this strip of coast has been greatly in evidence during the year in connection with the smuggling of arms by Afghans, many heavy con signments haying been successfully landed within it by the help of Mir Barkat. J ask D istrict^ No disturbances have occurred in the Jask district during the year, but a great deal of jealousy exists between Mir Mustapha Khan and his younger brother Mir Barkat. Up to the present Mustapiia Khan has been the recog nised head of the district, being some twenty years senior to his brother, but lately Barkat has gained considerable power, and is now inclined to interfere more than he should in the administration of the Jask district. The arms traffic has been directly responsible for the breach between the brothers. Mir Barkat's power is increasing, and also his propensity for fighting and looting. In January 1908, he took a strong force to Sindak in Bashkard, and looted property to the value of 20,000 krans. The Bashkardis recently came down to Barkat's district in Biyaban to revenge the attack, but they were not strong enough to do any serious damage, and were repulsed by Mir Barkat, who was assisted by Mir Haji of Biyaban. There are also other incidents which have occurred during the year of Barkat's looting unoffending Bashkardi traders on their way to the coast and for many months in the year he forbade the Bashkardis to trade with the Jask district. In March 1908, Mir Barkat accompanied the Governor of Bushire to Charbar and did good service in connection with the Customs trouble. He journeyed to Graih and induced Sardar Syed Khan to come to Charbar to meet the Governor of Bushire. The Governor of Bushire is apparently helping Barkat to gain a position in the country and it is quite possible that before long he will be installed as Chief of the Jask district. Only one case of slave dealing was reported during the year. Three boys were taken from the portion of Biyaban district governed by Mir Barkat, by one Hot Eakir Mohamed, and shipped to Suwaik on the Arab Coast. Hot Fakir Mohamed was formerly headman of the Parag sub -district. He lives at Suwaik but he is on friendly terms with the Jask Chiefs and often visits them. It seems that Mir Barkat is implicated with Hot Fakir Mohamed, and as the slaves are captured in his district it is quite probable that he obtains a fair portion of the profits. Biyaban is well out of touch of the telegraph line and this makes it difficult to obtain information of the extent of the traffic to the Arab Coast, but it is probable that Hot Fakir Mohamed has been successful in exporting other consignments of slaves besides the case reported. Very little rain fell this season, and although the date crop is not very „ . ._ seriously affected, the barley, wheat, Rainfall and Crops. ^ crops have and drought is general throughout the district. The large number of Afghans who have been established in the district for the past few months have bought up practically all that remained of last year's crops, which seriously affects the poorer classes, who are unable to import grain.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Gaih District.

The Dashtyari subsidy of Hs 1 000 per annum is now divided equally between Mir Din Mohamed and Mir MahmudKhan. Mir Din Mohamed is aged about 19 vears ; he has for the past four years been instructed in the management of the district by his uncle Mir Mahmud Khan, with whom he is on the best of terms. Although still' very young Mir Din Mohamed is exceptionally popular in the district on account of his sound judgment and leniency to the poorer people, and there seems reason to hope that the district will thrive under his and his uncle's V t * i ? 8 1 ^ ) ' . ? other districts in Persian Baluchistan, the population ot Dashtyan is increasing. r Tke limited rainfall this year affects Bashtyan rather more than other EainM and Crops. districts, as their chief export is cotton, , . ... , which requires much water in the early stages of its growth.

Last year it was shown how Sardar Syed Khan of Gaih used Mir Ahmed Jinan as his tool for the purpose of extracting as much money as possible out ot his district. A few months later Sardar Syed Khan dismissed Mir Ahmed Khan, and appointed Mir Nawab Khan {Syed Khan's nephew) as Chief of tut w , Ca '' y (&gt;n tlle administration of the district with Mir Asraf Khan. Mir Wawab Khan is a strong man; he brought with him some 400 armed lotto wersto Balm Kalat which created quite an impression in the country. He dismissed Mir Ahmed Khan from the district and threatened to kill him t he entered the Bahu district again. Mir Ahmed Khan has for the past seven months been living at Dashtyari with Mir Mahmud Khan, whoAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOB THE YEAR 1907-1908. 79 endeavoured to make peace between them, but Kawab Khan would not agree to Ahmed Khan's returning to the district. In March 1908, Mir Nawab Khan informed the Assistant Superintendent he had been appointed to the'Bahu district in place of Mir Ahmed Khan, and applied for his subsidy, but he failed to furnish any proof for his appointment and was advised to submit a formal application to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraph Section, giving his credentials or proper authority for his appoint ment, either from the Governor of Bampur or from Sardar Syed Khan of Gaih. Mir Ashraf Khan and Mir Nawab Khan are friendly, and the Bahu district should flourish under this rule. Mir Ahmed Khan is almost completely broken, and it is much doubted if he will ever regain sufficient power to enter Bahu territory again. Bis subsidy is entailed up to the Slst December 1908, when he will have com pleted all the payments against the theft of 24 camels of our telegraph employees, at Paleiri, two years ago. It may then be advisable to consider the transference of Mir Ahmed Khan's subsidy to Mir Nawab Khan. Practically no rain has fallen this sea- Eainfall and Crops. son, and drought prevails almost through out the district. Memorandum on the smuggling- of arms from Ma skat through the Mekran ports during the season 1907-1908, based on Mr. New^s report. Proposals for the establishment of land patrols and telephone stations on Measures imitated. ^ coas &gt; in order to obtain better inform- ation ot suspected landing of arms, were submitted, and subsequently sanctioned by the Government of India at a cost of E/S. 374 per mensem. The scheme was initiated at the end of November 1907,10 patrols being engaged and posted as follows :— North of the telegraph line, to watch roads from up country. Karwan district (one) Taran district (one) upper Gabreg district (one). Coast patrols, one at each of the following places :—Sadech, Soorug, Rapch, Bandeni, Bir, Jagin and Gabreg. A further sanction was subsequently obtained for the establishment of two additional patrols to watch the portion of coast between Tank and Charbar. One of these was employed at Sirgan, the other being utilized at the port of Bris Bunder (40 miles east of Charbar), as soon as Afghans began to operate on that section of the coast. Good reliable men were engaged for the work, and bad not the Afghans changed their field of operations from Gabreg to the coast of Biyaban, away from the telegraph line, it would have been possible to give such speedy information of suspected landing of arms as migi't have led to more captures than were accomplished during the season. It is clear, however, that the patrols and telephones, on the coast at all events, acted as a deterrent to the Afghans, and confined their operations to the Biyaban coast. The first Afghans to arrive this season travelled overland from Afghanis- tan, reaehinff Gabreg at the end of Commencement of Afghans operations. , T . _ ° ^ -r&gt;. . , -i. November 1907. During the succeeding months of December, January and February a few arrived at Jask by mail steamer, but the majority travelled overland, some direct to the Jask district, while others came from the direction of Bunder Abbas. They brought many transport camels from Afghanistan and purchased many more in the Biyaban and Minab districts. There was a lapse of two months between the arrival of Afghans on the coast, and the landing of their first consignment of arms at Gabreg. This was largely due to the rejection of some 50 Afghan passengers from Maskat, which greatly disorganized their plans, and later they were unable to come to terms with Mir Noor Mohamed of Gabreg to send Baluchis to Maskat to purchase rifles.go ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The lanfiins: of the first l?irge consignment of arms was accomplished at Gabreg on the 3rd March 1908, and, although, the patrol at Gahreg g a y e early indication of a suspected landing, in the circumstances it was almost impossible to determine the actual day of landing because the consign men t was kept back in Maskat, and the Afghans themselves had no idea when would cross. The circumstances of this particular landing were investigated by Mr. New, who found that the four boats which landed 2,880 rifles at Gabre? and 1,000 rifles at Habt had been ready loaded in Muttra early in February but the presence of H. M. S. Proserpine at Jask and Maskat caused the Afghans to delay departure until later, when they got information from All Moosa of the Proserpine's probable visit to Bushire. The consignment was thus kept back for nearly a month and eventually sent across after the Proserpine's departure up the Gulf. It seems that the Maskat arms dealer, Ali Moosa, is able to get informa tion regarding movements and destinations of ships from the dubash and bakers employed by His Majesty's ships. On the 2nd February 1908, 57 Afghans under Deen Mohamed Khan of Kabul, arrived at Gwadur by mail steamer from Karachi. They travelled to Dashtyari, where they halted, and when their intention of operating on the coast to the eastward of Charbar was known, Mr. New decided to establish a patrol and telephone at Kodi, near Bris Bunder. This party of Afghans made two successful landings, one at Bris Bunder on the 19th March 1908 and another at Pagjah (20 miles east of Charbar) on the 3rd April 1908. No indication of the arrival of either of these con signments could be obtained. With regard to the landing of 300 rifles at Bris Bunder on the 19th March 1908, it is regretted that the patrol at Kodi was fearful of the duties he had undertaken. He was dismissed and another man engaged. In addi tion to these two consignments, Deen Mohamed Khan bought about 800 rifles locally in the districts of Dashtyari and Bahu. With regard to the Afghans operating in the Ja^k district it was stated ^ .. _ , that Mir Noor Mohamed demanded Complicities of Mirs. , . , « u rather higher fees than the Afghans were dispose 1 to pay. Negotiations were accordingly opened with Mir Barkat of Jask and Biyaban, who was only waiting for a chance to induce the Afghans to divert their attention to his part of the coast. Mir Barkat is Chief of part of the Biyaban district which embraces the portion of coast from Kuh Mubarak to Karai Creek, and it will be seen that during the month of Ajjril many large consignments of arms were landed between these points. He no doubt informed the Afghans of the presence of our telephone stations and enumerated the advantages of carrying on their traffic through the country westward of Jask out of touch of the telegraph line, and the result was that his services were accepted. Mir Barkat arranged to engage local boats, and to send retainers of bis own to Maskat to purchase rifles. His men at the same time patrolled the coast to watch the approach of boats carrying consignments of arms» and also assisted in the landing of cargoes. In fact he afforded the Afghans every assistance and was liberally paid for his co-operation. The terms arranged were that Mir Barkat should receive Es. 2 and two rounds of ammunition on each rifle landed. Mir Barkat arranged the engage^ ment of boats givinsr the owner an advance of its. 100, and the balance whiQlj amounted to Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 according to the size of the boat, was paid by the Afghans on receipt of consignments. Altogether Mir Barkat is reputed to have received Rs. 23,000 from the Afghans and a considerable quantity of ammunition. It does not appear that Mir Barkat shared his takings from the reason with any other Chiefs of the Jask or Biyaban districts. In fact the two Chiefs of Biyaban, Mir Haji and Mir Kambar of Buoji, wrote letters to the officer in charge at Jask corroborating the fact that Mir Barkat was assisting the Afghans and receiving money from them. Their motive was undoubtedlyAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1903. 81 jealousy and bitterness against Mir Barkat for refusing to share the profits of the undertaking with them. Mir Mustafa Khan, Chief of the Jask district, at the beginning of the season was inclined to accept the tempting bribes offered by the Afghans, but he was made to realise his duty as a subsidised Chief, and is not believed to have been personally implicated to any serious extent with the arms traffic. No doubt, Mir Barkat engaged many boats belonging to subjects of Mir Mustapba's district, bnt this could hardly have been prevented as the former has a considerable amount of influence in the Jask district, and Mir Mustapha Khan has very little, if any, control over him. This season there is a prodigious increase in the number of rifles imported by Afghans, the estimated number reaching nearly 17,000. Moreover more than three million rounds of ammunition and about 2,000 Mauser and Brown ing automatic pistols, are believed to have been imported in addition to the rifles, and judging by the large numbers of Afghans now engaged in the traffic it would seem that the undertaking is rather more than a commercial enterprise, as was formerly supposed. On the 26th March 1908 H. M. S. JProserpine while cruising off Bunji Ca tureg narrowly missed capturing a dhow carry- ap ure ' ing a consignment of arms. While the JProserpine was searching what proved to be a fishing boat, another dhow was observed to be making for the beach near Bunji. The dhow was able to get out of sight round Kuh Mubarak point, where her cargo was thrown into the sea, close to the beach, in about 10 feet of water and on being subs p qufntly overhauled by the Proserpine she was found to be empty. The case was suspicious and Captain H. W. James decided to capture the dhow and keep her until evidence of her complicity in the arms traffic was obtainable. Confirming evidence of this particular dhow having jettisoned her cargo of aims came to hand on the 29th March 1908, and the dhow was burnt at Jask on the same day by order of the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf. It was reported that 844 rifles be 1 onging to this consignment were subse- qnently recovered by the Afghans assisted by Mir Barkat's men and local divers, but it is uncertain whether the consignment originally consisted of 1,000 or more rifles, or whether any ammunition was lost. Acting on informa tion received from Bunji, while cruising off Bunji on the morning of the 18th April, H. M. S, Proserpine captured a dhow containing 1,500 rifles and 250,000 rounds of ammunition. This was the only capture of a boat complete with its crew and contents made during the season. A landing party from H. M. S. JProserpine met with an unfortunate accident • • i u . at the same spot the following day. Three British casoaities. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a dhow, which was hauled up on the beach, and had actually landed rifles the previous evening. On attempting to reach the shore from these boats the party met with a very heavy rifle fire from some 200 Afghans, who were ambushed among sand hiils quite close to the beach. As they retired to their boats at the same time returning the fire, unfortunately their maxim jammed, and if their retreat had not been covered by a very heavy shell fire from H. M. S. Proserpine it is probable that a sood many casualties would have resulted. As it was two of the Proserpine's bluejackets received mortal wounds and were buried at J ask. Careful enquiries were made by Mr, New as to the damage done by H. M. S. Proserpine's shell fire and as far as he could ascertain only one camel, belonging to the Afghans was killed and the top of a hut was blown off. The ground near the beach at Bunji is composed of sand-dunes running in ridges parallel to the beach which afford excellent cover, and this would account for the little damage done to the enemy, Prom local information received regarding the incident it appears that a body of some fifty Afghans were ambushed directly opposite the spot where ^ the ship's party landed, while the remainder were in extended order on both sides* covering about 500 yards ©f coast line. Their intention was to allow all themm 11 the party 82 'ADMINISTEATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Proserpine's party to disembark, and then rush them with the hor capturing some and holding tbem as a ransom in exchange for the 1 500 % captured the previous day by His Majesty's ship, fortunately their plans w spoilt by another party of Afghans, who were marching from inland to 616 beach, and who were the first to open fire directly they saw the ship's commence landing. Captain H. W. James must be credited with yet another success. A dh crossing to Bunji from the Batina Coast was sighted and searched iT H. M. S. Proserpine on the 30th April, but found to be quite emnt^ It was afterwards reported by a special kassid, who obtained the inform a ticf* from the nacoda of the dhow, that their cargo, which consisted of 150 boxT (40,000 rounds) of ammunition was thrown overboard before thev we 8 overhauled. re The number of rifles imported during the season by Baluchis also shows a Import by BaiucMs, v ^y bi ? ^crease. The^ Afghans and Baiu- chis operate at different both industries appear to be distinct from one another, although it is quite' pro bable that nearly all the rifles eventually get into the hands of Afghans. It will be noticed that Baluchis cease importing during the winter months from December to April, during which season the Afghans are engaged in the traffic They commence importing again early in May, slackening during the monsoon months on account of the difficulty in getting boats to cross and reopen their operations again in October. It is probable that the 100 camels laden with arms, which were reported by the Political Officer, Chagai, to have reached Afghan territory in April 1908 were part of the consignments imported by Baluchis during the season aod were probably purchased from Sardar Syed Khan of Gaih or Mirza Khan nf Binth. On the 22nd March 1908, there was a rumour current at Jask that there were 2,000 Afghans in the vicinity and that they intended to attack tb; telegraph station if any of their arms were captured by His Majesty's shins Mr. JNew arrived at Jask from Maskat the day after and at once instituted carerul enquires as to the number of Afghans in the immediate vicinity and their location. It was found there were some 600 to 600 Afghans scattered over the Jask and Biyaban districts within a radius of 40 miles of Jask. Of these 250 were camped in the hills above Arduri to the eastward of Jask, wait ing for an expected landing of arms at Gabreg, but their plans were evidently changed, because at the end of March they moved over to the westward of Jask and joined the remaining Afghans who were encamped near Kuh Mubarak. *, The Upper Gabreg patrol was thereupon transferred to Kuh Mubarak and arrangemenis made with certain trustworthy men of old Jask, and of villages further west, to bring in information of the movements of the snm^ f, ers A , ^ threat against the telegraph station was found to emanate from tne Aignans themselves, the situation was considered to be critical, and everv- tiling was done to get early information of their movements and intentions.

The marines were meanwhile posted on the roof of the main building, one Maxim being mounted on the roof of the Superintendent's house. This party remained on shore till the 14th May. Lieutenant J. V. M. Biscoe, I.A., arrived at Jask by mail steamer on the 2Sth April with a detachment of 53 men of the H2th Native Infantry from Nasirabad. He occupied the Persian fort tbe same evening that Major Noel Smith's marines were withdrawn, and this occupation was maintained until the 23rd May, when it was known that all tbe Afghans who were on the coast near Jask had reached a point nearly 200 miles up-country. Early in April 1908, enquiries were instituted regarding the route by which the Afghans intended to travel back to Afghanistan. About the end of March some 200 Afghans went up-country accompanying the consignment of rifles landed at Gabreg and Habt on the 5rd March. They halted at Kamshao- lak near Ramisk in the Bashkard district, which place was considered to be their rendezvous, and remained there till they were joined about the middle of May by an escort party of 500 Afghans, who came down from Afghanistan, arriving at Eanoch about the 15th April. These two parties were joined later near Eamisk by 70 Afghans from the Dashtyari district. Of the Afghans operating on the Biyaban coast, 305, accompanying about 12,000 rifles and much ammunition, left the coast near Bunji on the 30th April. They travelled northwards to Sarzhai (12 miles north-east of Sirik) where they waited some days for provisions from Minab, and later continued their journey north, leaving Sarzhai on the 10th May. Another small party of 45 Afghans remained on the coast near Bunji to receive the last consignment of arms landed at Gawah on the 2nd Mayj and afterwards joined the party of 305 Afghans. Mr. New did his utmost to follow the movements of these five bodies of 500, 200, 70, 305 and 45 Afghans and was able to trace them to points rather more than 100 miles from Jask. Their first intention was that all parties should meet somewhere near Bamisk and travel together via Bampur, but this route was afterwards abandoned in favour of the Began route. Patrols and special kassids were sent north from Bapch and Soorug to Fanoch and Bamisk to watch the Bampur route and also to Anguhran in Bashkard to follow the movements of the 305 Afghans proceeding in that direction. Mr. New was thus able to keep well posted in regard to the movements from place to place of these bodies of Afghans, but the chief difficulty lay in fixing their route northwards from points about 100 miles from Jask. The know ledge of the tract north of Bamisk possessed by patrols and kassids, was very limited, and as they persistently returned from up=country with information denoting the location of parties only, it w r as not only most difficult to accurately determine their northward route, but usually necessitated the despatch of another kassid and greatly delayed the receipt of reliable information. Fortunately news reached Jask in time for Mr. New to report definitely that all five bodies of Afghans had met and were travelling towards Began, and their movements were about this time picked up by the Inspector in charge of the Central Persia Telegraph Line at Bam. Meanwhile on the Baluchistan border timely arrangements had been made by the Government of India for the interception of smuggling caravans should they impinge on British territory, the small garrison at Bobat being reinforced for this purpose by the despatch of some 600 men from the 126th and 127th Regiments of Native Infantry with three Maxims. The Persian Government had also been pressed to take concurrent action, and two forces were simultaneously organised in Seistan and Bam, respectively, with a view to operating in Persian territory. The final chapter of the season's record does not properly fall within the limit of this year's report, but in order to complete the narrative it may be mentioned that after their experience of last year the Afghans were careful to keep clear of British territory and had no difficulty in dealing with the Persian detachments sent out. T£84, ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCE They did indeed come in contact with the latter, one caravan of 200 camels and 100 men exchanging shots with the Seistan forcp, but eluding them by negociating a difficult pass under cover of darkness ; while the main bodv consisting, it is said, of an enormous caravan of 2,700 camels, escorted bv 750 men, on passing Dashtak, came into brief contact with the force sent out 'fro m Bam, but the latter were unable to tackle such a strong body, and the Afghans after capturing two Persian officers passed unchecked northwards, and having negociated the Kud-Mahi river at Gurg, eventually made good their entry into Afghan territory after doing all the injury they could to the Indo -European Telegraph Line en route. The grave risks to which this important section of the Central Persian Line and the personnel in charge of it are becoming exposed as the result of British efforts to place a check on the arms traffic, and the means which can best be employed for safeguarding their interests, have become a new and difficult factor in this extremely complex problem which doubtless occupies the lively attention of Government.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. gg CHAPTER VII. ADMINISTEATION EE PORT OE THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOETHE YEAR 1907-1908. The politico of Oman have been disturbed during the official year 1907- Oman Politics. 1908 by another murder, namely, that of Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin As Siayibi, perpetrated at Bidbid by two treacherous friends of his. This murder was undertaken to counteract in some measure the great political loss His Highness the Sultan had sustained by the murder of his very able and powerful supporter, Wali Suleiman-bin-Suweylim, which was fully described in last year's Report and also because Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin refused to deliver up the murderers of Wali Suleiman-bin-Suwejlim, the murder having occurred in bis, the Siabiyin, territory. It was proved that the Siabiyin, a Ghafiri tribe, were implicated in the murder of Shaikh Suleiman-bin-Suweylim. SuS-^S^o^ 0 4119 murder 0f Wali The Sultan wrote to Shaikh Seif-bin- Mohsin ordering him to deliver up the murderers. Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin. replied that the accusation against his followers was false and declined to comply with the request. Thereupon Shaikh Isa-bin-Sa]eh A1 Harithi offered to fight the Siabiyin, to assist His Highness and force them to surrender the murderers. The Sultan, however, declined the offer, it being obviously a treacherous one, as Shaikh Isa is his hereditary enemy and he had every reason to suspect his complicity in the murder of the Wali Suleiman-bin-Suweylim. Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin, however, prepared for eventualities by building two small forts at Nafab near Bidbid, commanding the route to the Semayil valley. A correspondence then ensued between Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh and His Highness in regard to whether Saiyid Taimur, His Highness's eldest son, should go as an envoy to Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh and arrange for the surrender of the murderers of Wali Suleiman-bin-Suweylim, and at the same time make a lasting peace between the two bouses. His Highness the Sultan acting on the advice of the Political Agent declined these offers as there were the strongest grounds for suspecting treachery. Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh would have worked on Saiyid Taimur's religious fervour and taken advantage of his youth and inexperience to sow seeds of discord between father and son. His High ness finally replied that Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh must write in letter form any proposals he had to make to him. That closed the incident. Shaikh Isa-bin- Saleh subsequently went to Mudhaibi and Audam where he arranged a meeting with Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Said El Khalili of the Bani Ru^ahah, another hereditary enemy of His Highness, His Highness the Sultan growing tired at the policy of inaction and __ , p o, , a •£ i.. iit i, • deceit practised by Shaikhs Seif-bin- Murder or Shaikh fceit-bm-Mohsin. n/ri- it i • o i i • jit Mohsm and Isa-bm-Saleh in not dehver- ing up the murderers of Wali Suleiman-bin-Saweylira, determined to act boldly himself and launch an astute blow againsr his opponents and enemies. Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin at this time was at Bidbid. His Highness the Sultan having secretly arranged with two old friends of Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin, viz.y Said-bin-Khamis, the Wali of Bidbid, and Muhammad-bin-Salim El Hamdi, one of his own askarees, sent them to Bidbid in order to do away with him. Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin suspecting nothing entered a musjid at Bidbid with Said-bin-Khamis and on their coming out of the door together, Muhammad- bin-Salim El Hamdi who was lying in ambush, shot Shaikh Seif-bin-Mohsin dead. The murderers and their followers then ran off to Semayil, where Saiyid Nadir, the Sultan's second son, was waiting for them. No figbtinsr occurred as the result of Shaikh Seif-bin-Mobsin's death. Sir Saiyid Faisal rewarded the two men suitably.g0 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY His Highness the Sultan, in September, again sent his second son SaivM o* ■ l * • Nadir to Semayil with two o -n^ ^ Small expedition against the Siabiyin. a t t i • QUe ^ brass from fort Jelah and the other breech-loadiog one which was presented to him in 1905 by the French H* had with him 30 Turkish soldiers of His Highness and 100 different tribesmen from about Sib, which was used as the base for the operations and to which Sir Saiyid Paisal himself paid a flying visit. The object of the expedition was to cause the two small forts at Bidbid, which were built by Shaikh Seif. bin-Mohsin, to be destroyed. When the Siabiyin heard of this expedition' Shaikh Hamid-bin-4thim As Siabi and four followers left Nafah and went to meet Saiyid Nadir in a friendly way at-Semayil. Saiyid Nadir, however seized these men and held them as hostages, meanwhile ordering the Siabiyin to raze the forts to the ground. This they did at once, and their Shaikh and his followers were then liberated. The late Wali Suleiman-bin-Suweylim built four forts near Zikki, two at Karuth and two on Jabel Karun. These Capture of Wo forts near Zikki by Bani Eiyam. were garrisoned by the Bani Euwahah for His Highness the Sultan. About 800 of the Bani Eiyam suddenly surprised the garrisons at Jabel Karun, overpowered them, and captured the two forts. Shaikh Abdullah- bin-Said El Khalili of the Bani Euwahah wrote offering His Highness to proceed against the Bani Eiyam'—Bani Euwahah and Bani Kiyam being hereditary enemies, and asked His Highness for supplies of food and monev. His Highness accepted the offer and sent the supplies demanded and appointed Muzzaffer-bin-Suleiman-bin-Suweylim as leader of the expedition. There upon Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Said El Khalili refu ed ^co-operation, saying he would never serve under the son of a slave, and the expedition ended in a fiasco. Saiyid Nadir from Semayil attempted negotiations with the Bani Eiyam but they also were devoid of result.

The Sultan, however, had no idea of equipping an expedition for that purpose. Inter-tribal quarrels. —In April a quarrel arose between the two factions of Bani Kahsib. -^ an ^ I^ahsib, a Ghafiri tribe of Jaalan, three men were killed and five wounded. Shaikh Saleh-bin-Yasir resigned the leadership of the tribe as the quarrel arose over his suitability for the post. This temporarily caused the hostilities to cease. Two months later, however, a fresh quarrel arose in which six men were killed. Shaikh Saleh then committed suicide by shooting himself. Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Salim, the Amir of the Bani Bu AH, then seized and imprisoned 15 men of the Bani Eahsib and arranged a lasting peace among the tribe. In May, two factions of the Jennebeh, at Sur—the Fawaris and the Jennebeh. Arama—fought among themselves, k Bania Seth Jeiram Kesowji was accident ally wounded in the arm by a stray bullet. The Shaikhs of the Jennebeh com pensated him by a payment of Es. 300 with the sanction of the Political Agent, who visited Sur for the purpose of investigating the matter. His Highness the Sultan wrote to the Shaikhs of Jennebeh ordering the two sections to make peace. The Shaikhs uf the Fawaris then came to Maskat to see His Highness asking him to decide their quarrel with the Arama. They accused Shaikh Said-bin-Sultan the Tamimah uf the Jennebeh of unduly favouring the Arama. The Sultan then sent Hamid-bin-Hamad to Sur in his yacht, the Nur-ul-JBahr, with written terms of peace which were accepted by both the sections. and 1 Ba U nT ahah 0wing to tlle old M 0 o d -feuds existing between these tribes, fighting Eiyam, frequently took place between them during the year, in the neighbourhood ofAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 87 Zikki and the Jebel Akhdar. There was loss of life on both sides, but no signal victory was obtained by either party, exceptino: the capture of the two forts on Jebel Karun, by the Bani Eiyam, already referred to. Some desultory fighting took place in Jaalan between the Bani Bu Ali Bani Bu Ali and Bani Bu Hassan, the powerful Ghafiri and Binayi tribes of that district.

On 10th January news reached Maskat that the A1 Kathir of Dhofar had killed three slaves of the late 'Wali Suleiman-bin-Suweylim. These slaves formed part of the Customs guard there. The inhabitants, it was rumoured, had sent a deputation to the Sultan of Makalla pleading for his protection. His Highness fearing a revolt of the inhabitants, similar to that of 1897, at once despatched his eldest son, Saiyid Taimur, and the Wali of Mutrah to Dhofar in his yacht, the Nur-ul-Bahr along with 40 soldiers. He instructed them to take suitable steps to ensure peace and conciliate the inhabitants. On arrival at Dhofar everything was found to be perfectly quiet. The three slaves were found to have been killed at the inland Customs post because they had continued to demand enhanced duty so as to line their own pockets. The Kathiris, however, would not visit Saiyid Taimur being afraid of being seized and deported to Maskat. Saijid Taimur appointed a Munshi of His Highness the Sultan, named Abedin Kasim Ali, an Indian Muhammadan, as Customs Officer. Saiyid Taimur then left for Maskat, taking with him the Naib Wali of Dhofar and a Nubian slave of the late Wali Suleiman-bin- Suweylim. H.M.S. Ferseus paid a visit, subsequently, to Dhofar and several of the Shaikhs went on board on the invitation of the Commander. He also landed and gave a few presents to the chief Shaikhs and made a small tour in the surrounding district. On April 12th, news was received of the death at Poona of Saiyid Abdul Obituary. Aziz -bin-Said, uncle of His Highness the Sultan. The Sultan's flag and those of all the Consulates were left at half mast for a week. This unfortunate prince was named in the lifetime of Said Turki by the then Political 4.gent as the most fitted and likely heir to succeed him. But when Sultan Saiyid Turki died and the occasion arose to grasp the power, his friends and followers, who twice during the lifetime o| Saiyid Turki had attempted but failed to capture Maskat for him, refused to assist him. This was due to the intriguing of Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali el Harithi, who to gratify his own ambition did not wish to see a strong man on the throne of Maskat. After feeble attempts to oust his nephew from power in which ho received no support from the influential Shaikhs, Saiyid Abdul Aziz retired to India, where he continued to vainly ask the Government of India to interfere on his behalf. Happily this troublesome question has been finally settled. French Flag A proclamation has been prepared in Arabic in the name of His Highness ^estion. Sir Saiyid Faisal and will shortly be issued to all whom it may concern. The number of dhows permitted to fly the French flag has been finally reduced to 13. There are, however, six subjects of Zanzibar, who by virtue of an agreement signed at Zanzibar in 1904, between the French and English Governments, are to be regarded as proteges of France ' a titre Zanzibarite ' during their lifetime. Their dhows have been registered in our Consulate, but only a few of them are stated to trade with Oman. It is certain that several owners of dhows permitted to fly the French flag are only waiting for the authorization of His Highness's proclamation to renounce their rights. It is a matter for great mutual congratulation that this difficult question is finally disposed of. His Highness expresses himself as very grateful for the assistance and support he has received throughout from the British Government.^\« v Customs. Finance. Arms and ammunition- 88 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The administration of the Customs has-been fairly satisfactory as far as the public is concerned. No complaints of importance were made against it by British subjects. Nevertheless, the personnel employed are not sufficiently intelligent or educated for the efficient discharge of their duties. No intelligent system of accounts is kept either of money received or paid out. Seth Damoder Dharm- sev, a Bania, is the nominal head of the Customs. He, however, has been absent in'India for six months, and in tiie interval Shaikh Abdul Karim, an Indian Muhammadan, who was only a menial gatekeeper when Mohomed Ibrahim supervised the Customs, has been left in sole charge, assisted by a few clerks of Bania Damoder. it is a pity that hitherto His Highness the^ Sultan has not thought it advisable to appoint an experienced officer who might reorganise the entire administration to His Highness's great profit. Patting aside political considerations, one of the stumbling blocks to that course has been provided by the unprecedented import of arms and ammunition which lias enormously swelled the Customs receipts, enabling the Sultan to get rid of his debts and be free from pecuniary embarrassment for the first time since he ascended the throne. All the arms merchants willingly pay him | a dollar on each rifle imported in addition to the customs duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem. The payment of this tax entitles the merchants to a free pass or license from the Local Government to export the arms. The Maria Theresa dollar still continues as the current coin in Maskat, The great fluctuations in its value cause many of the merchants here to speculate usually with disastrous results. A suggestion to try and abolish the dollar and to introduce the Indian rupee as the current coin is still under consideration. It is stated that the Arabs are beginning to realize the great advantage of its stability. Mr. Stephen, Manager of the National Bank of India, Ld., Karachi, paid a private visit to Maskat in March. He stated that the opening of a sub* agency in connection with Karachi would be an easy matter. Many of the merchants are anxious to see this plan adopted. There was a still further and unprecedented increase in the arms traffio over the preceding year amounting to 148 per cent. Last year it had increased by 56 per cent, over the preceding year. In two years, therefore, the trade has risen from Es. 6,10,6^5 to Rs. 41,85,760. The following table shows the amounts imported from the different countries Belgium United Kingdom France Germany . . Biiles. 45,370 80,800 6,280 5,230 Revolvers. 1 ,565 1,220 220 Nil Cartridges. 5,055,000 3,870,000 2,151,000 1 ,230,000 The English rifle is still very popular owing to its superior workmanship and finish. The Belgian one is a plausible imitation of the English and owing to its cheaper price has a very largre sale. The French and German rifles are very inferior in quality. The pattern is the Martini-Henry type. The average market price of a rifle with 100 cartridse is English Rs. 35, Belgian Es. 30, French Rs. 18 and German Rs. 15. Most of the arms impor ted are believed to have been sent up the Gulf in dhows. Twenty thousand rifles with their complement of 100 rounds of ammunition per rifle left for the Mekran Coast. His Majesty's ships employed to check the traffic met with no success during the official year. The masters of the badans and dhingies employed to transport the arms were paid freight money equal to the value of the vessel tocoTer the risk of seizure by the men -of-war an often received a bonus besides. Most of the rifles carried across to Mekran were for Pathans who al though expelled from Maskat by wish of the .Local Government collected in large numbers near Jask waiting to receive the various consignments ana thence convey them to Afghanistan.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 89 Three Somali boats managed through Agents to embark some 800 rifles either at Suwaik on the Batineh Coast or at Sur and to convey them to Soma- liland or the Benadir Coast. His Highness warned his subjects not to sell them arms. The British and Prench subjects were likewise warned. The settlement in regard to the compensation to be paid by His Marine. Highness for the looting of the crew and passengers of the dhow Ai&amp;m- of Cutch, which was wrecked off Ras Madraka and was fully described in last dad ' year's Eeport, is still under consideration. The blame has not been able to be brought home to any particular tribe or Sheikh. Strong suspicion, however, attaches to the inhabitants of Masirah and Mahot. The matter has not been pressed, however, owing to their exemplary behaviour in the case of the strand ing of S.S. Teutonia. On May 1st, the sailing ship Alamghir anchored at the entrance t 0 Wreck at Maskat the Maskat harbour, attempted to set sail for Lingah. A strong south-east ' Alain ' wind was blowing. Owing to seme unexplained carelessness in the handling of tlie ship she was allowed to drift on to Ras Kalboo at the western entrance of the harbour. She was owned by Yusef Mahomed Husain of Lingah and carried a cargo of 10,000 bags of rice. The Sultan's yacht the JSiur-el-Bahr subsequently towed her into Makalla, a part of Ma skat harbour where the coal sheds are situated. She became a total wreck. The smell in the harbour from the ferm enting rice was almost unbearable. Fortunately the Arabs quickly conveyed the rice in boats up and down the coast. His Highness wisely forbade its being landed in Maskat or Mutrah. H.M.S. Perseus at His Highnesses request blew up the remains of the sailing ship in February as it obstructed navigation. The S. S. Teutonia left Lingah for Europe on July 16th. On July wreck of the 20th she stranded on a spit of sand 4 miles to the north of Ras Madraka where fortunately she was partially protected from the monsoon waves. On July 22nd, the ship having broken her back and being full, of water it became necessary to abandon her. Captain Scharges arranged to launch four ship's boats. Previously he had instructed the officers in charge of each exactly what course to steer, and it was agreed they should keep in sight Of one another and tie up together at night time so as to avoid being separated in the dark. Unfortunately it was foggy and in addition a heavy sea was running. Outside Ghubbet Kuerat two out of the four boats became sepa rated from the others and were lost sight of in the fog. The Captain with the two other boats set sail for Masirah Island spending anight with the two boats tied together at sea. Next morning they arrived at Umm-ar-Rasas on Masirah Island. Later on they proceeded to Dawwa. They were well received there by Ali-bin-Nasir-el-Farisi, who, it will be recol lected, was one of those who were imprisoned in connection with the JBaron Innerdale outrage. They provided the officers and men with fowls, eggs, rice, etc., without payment beyond a verbal promise that they would receive money at Maskat. Captain Scharges then called for volunteers among his crew and pluckily sailed his lifeboat for Maskat where he safely arrived on August 3rd. On August the 8th, the remainder of the officers and men from Masirah arrived in a dhow in company with Ali-bin-Nasir el Farisi who personally brought them to Maskat. He was thanked by His Highness, who was much pleased by his subjects' behaviour. The Hamburg-America Company rewarded him for his kindness and hospitality to their sailors. In regard to the other two boats much anxiety was felt as the sea was very rough and one of them was only a very small boat. On August 22nd s however, all the remaining crew arrived in a dhow and it 'was th^n ascertained that the bigger boat stranded on the rocks at Gubbst Kuerat. Her crew of 10 men (5 Germans— 3 sailors and 2 officers—and 5 Arabs from Port Said) were compelled to abandon her. They walked along the coast to Surab sustaining great hardships from want of water and food. The coast here being formed of barren rocks right down to the water's edge they had great physical difficulties to overcome which may be understood from its taking them five days to accomplish the 30 miles separating the two places. At last they reached SurabgQ 'ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY, safely and fell in with some fishermen who fed them and conveyed them in a Badan to Mahot. There fortunately they found the small boat's crew beincr hospitably entertained. The smaller boat had proceeded in the first instance to Sarah where fishermen conveyed them along with their boat to Mahot. At Mahot both boats' crew were hospitably received by Easind-bin- Sawwad el Hikmani. He is a Shaikh of the el Hikmani inhabiting the Barub Eikman as the land is called surrounding the^ Ghubbet-ul-Hashish. H e personally conducted the boat's crew to Maskat in two dhows where they arrived safely on the 21st and 22nd August, respectively. He was thanked and rewarded for his kindness and trouble. Meanwhile H.M.S. Lapwing had been deputed by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to go iu search of the missing boats and also to visit the wreck. The Commander of the Lapwing found it impracticable to launch a boat to visit the wreck and while passing Masirah Island he heard of the safe despatch in dhows of the missing crew. The Hamburg-Am erica Company in November made a donation of £50 to the Agency Hospital funds to mark their appreciation of the kindness their officers and crew had received in Maskat. His Highness the Sultan had the thanks of the Government of India regarding the behaviour of his subjects conveyed to him at an official visit. The Captain, officers and crew of the Teutonia all reached Germany safely. The steamer is a total wreck. Slave trade. As noticed in la?t years report, there appears to be no doubt that the sbve traffic between Oman and the African ports has ceased. This may be inferred from the fact that the Africans who applied for freedom durino* the past two years have all been in Oman some years. There were none of recent importation. Forty-five slaves applied at the Agency for freedom, 42 were granted manumission certificates, 3 were found not entitled to freedom under treaty stipulations. With regard to these latter His Highness the Sultan took a bond from their masters for the kind treatment of the slaves before surrender ing them. Of the forty-three (43) freed, 23 were Africans and 20 Mekranis. Of these Mekranis ^ only elected to return to Mekran, the rest chose to remain and earn their livelihood in Oman. Five Africans w^ere repatriated via Bombay by mail steamer and 6 were sent direct to Zanzibar in a dhow. H.M.S. Lapsing conveyed 2 to Karachi, 10 elected to remain in Oman. Five applications were m^de by Mekranis to recover their relatives from slavery in Oman and the Trucial coast. Those in Oman were recovered. The Shargah Agent was written to to assist those in the Trucial Coast. Public health Maskat has been quite free from epidemic diseases and the public health and quarantine, has been good. Malarial fever is the prevalent disease, but shows a considerable decrease over last year. This is due to the very small rainfall—1 inch and 80 cents. The marsh immediately outside the city wall has quite dried up in consequence. The benefit of this has been felt in the almost entire absence of mosquitos. No blackwater fever occurred. The quarantine arrangements were carried on by Captain Norman Scott, I. M.S., to the satisfaction ot the Local Government and public. J-/® ^ ie w . or ^ : Hospital is at present being carried on with difficulty^ in the Munshi s and Postmaster's quarters. This is inconvenient and a suggestion to acquire a plot of land and build a modern well equipped hospital is under consideration. Rainfall. ^ This has been very scanty—1 inch and 80 cents. Last year it amounted to ^ 1D j S an( ^ CeD ^ S an ^ ^ ear P rev i ous to 5 inches. This may diminish the date crop slightly, although much more rain is said to have fallen in the interior. HisExcellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Sir George J. S. War- render, ^ B. s C.V.O., A.-D.-C., visited Maskat in the flagship H.M.S. Hyacinth, ills Excellency exchanged visits with the Political Agent and His Highness thefeultan. The other ships which have visited Maskat during the official year are H-M.S.i Highflyer, Proserpine, Perseus, Sphinx, Lapwing and Redbreast and also the KJ.M.S. Lawrence and the I. E. Telegraph steamer PatrickThe Poreign Navy was represented by E, F. Surprise. Owing to political Toure. considerations necessitating his presence in Maskat, the ;Political Agent only paid flying visits to the Batineh Coast and Sur in the autumn. L q the spring Monsieur R. Laronce, the French Consul, with his Dragoman left in a badan for Sur as usual to examine the papers of the dhows flying the French flag. He was absent 12 days. His Highness the Sultan in the Nur-el-Bahr visited Sur, Ras-el-Had, Ras-el-Jabal, Sohar and Khabura. Owing to complaints by British subjects against the Wali of Khabura, His Highness, having personally enquired into the matter, deposed him and appointed the Wall of Shinas in his place. In December the Hon'ble Major Sir H. McMahon, Agent to the Visits - Governor-General in Baluchistan, paid a private visit to Maskat in R.I.M.S. Lawrence. Private visits were exchanged with His Highness the Sultan. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf paid no visit during the^ official year. Two suspicious foreigners visited Maskat. One, an Egyptian, Abdul Nasib Foreigners. Autaki, editor of the ^ published in Egypt. He visited the Sultan and then left for Bahrein by the slow mail. The other, Juman-bin-Ahmed-ush-Shantrah, came from Sana in the Yemen. He had also an interview with the Sultan and left for Debai. Major W. G. Grey, I. A., continued in charge of the Agency and official changes. Consulate. Captain Norman Scott, I.M.S. r continued in charge of the Agency Hospital and His Highness's quarantine arrangements. There were no changes among the foreign representatives. Monsieur E, Laronce continuing as French Consul and Mr. W. Coffin as American Consul.

The past year has been a most uneventful one among the Trueial Chiefs. The arrangement effected between the Sheikhs of Abu Thabi and Umm« el-Kawain recorded in last year's report has so far not been broken, and peace has reigned throughout the hinterland. Sheikh Zaeed-bin-Khalifa of Abu Thabi continues to be very difficult to deal with, and shows a tendency to neglect the claims of British Indians residing in his part; always dragging out his standing grievances (the Taona case, etc.) when he is remonstrated with. The Sheikh of Debai has also given a little trouble in regard to the treatment of British subjects, but has eventually accepted the views of the Resident in regard to incidents referred for orders, and accorded reasonable justice. The conduct of the other Sheikhs has been satisfactory, and except for the Abu Musa case, which has been dealt with elsewhere, their territories furnish no material for special record. P. Z. COX, Major, Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,and the maskat political agency for the year 1907-1908. 95 CHAPTER IX. ADMINISTRATION REPOET OP THE BAHBEIN POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR iy07-1908. General. The year under report has been comparatively uneventful, the financial outlook being gloomy in the extreme owing to the foreign pearl markets having shown no sign of improvement at any time, while a most serious out break of plague in the spring contributed further to render trading unsafe, consequent not only upon the mortality amonsst debtors but also upon the abrupt flight of others—chiefly British Indian, Turkish and Persian subjects— beyond the ken of their creditors. The general volume of Bahrein trade has fallen from Rs. 4,73,18,202 in 1906 to Rs. 3,18,33,633 in 1907-1908, showing a drop of 3r 72 per ce^t. The trade is still however 12 per cent, greater than it was in 19 the year prior to the Government of India's active intervention in the State's affairs for the checking of misrule. The result of the peayl-fishery of 1907 would be regarded in an ordinary year as satisfactory, the take being above the average but not including so many pearls of the first quality as in the preceding two years. The people of both Katar and Katif are believed to have had better fortune than bad those of Bahrein. Rainfall and Harvest. The rain p all in Bahrain amounted this year to only 1*28 inches, half an inch of which fell on the night of the 22nd May 1907, doing perhaps as much harm as good. This last mentioned fall was accompanied by a cyclonic storm of wind which levelled with the ground almost every date-stick and matting hut on the islands. The number of date-trees uprooted and destroyed was first estimated at 3 000, subsequently increased to 10,000. Six or eight boats anchored in the harbour were overturned and completely broken up. Six persons were said to have been drowned, and 24 others in imminent danger were picked up out of the sea by a life-boat from British India Steam Navigation Company s steamer Via, for which act two of the ship's officers received medals from the Royal Humane Society. A portion of the pearling fleet also encountered the hurricane on the pearl-banks, about a dozen boats being capsized. The crews, however, were saved with the exception of about three persons. As a set-off against the material damage done, the plague-infected towns and villages no doubt received a badly needed cleaning, and this, in conjunction with the advent of the hot weather immediately afterwards, probably caused the epidemic to commence subsiding as it did from about the beginning or June. The deficiency of the rainfall on the mainland, especially in Katar, was as serious as in the islands. Practically no crop of grass was obtained at all, in consequence of which most of the aquatic-nomadic tribes of Katar were obliged to send the greater portion of their flocks, camels and horses to the vicinity of Hasa and even beyond for the hot weather of 1908. The 1907 date crop in Hasa was a bumper one, both in quality and quantity. Some difficulty was experienced, however, in getting the surplus produce up to Basrah, where Hasa dates are much esteemed, in consequence of the insecurity of the caravan routes. The Katif crop was an average one, and the Bahrain crop rather below the average.00 'administration report of the persian gulf political residency] An estimate given to the Political Airent by a knowledgeable Babraini of the total outturn of dates in the three districts is as follows:— Hasa 2,000,000 tons, Katif 533,000 tons and Bahrain 234,000. Bahrain as the Trade Returns show^ is never able to produce the quantity of dates required for its own consumption. P ublic H ealth. The islands of Bahrain were very healthy except for the period, 19th April to 4th July, when a severe outbreak of plague raged visiting almost every town village and hamlet. It is estimated that 3,121 seizures occurred from this disease with 1 889 deaths. The latter included 16 Hindus, 2 Bobras, 2 Jews and about 200 Persians; 2 Mubammadan sepoys of the Agency Infantry Guard succumbed as well as 1 refugee slave who was sheltering in the Agency. Several of the Political Agent's servants recovered from slight attacks* Casualties also occurred amongst the servants of all other Europeans in the place (Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., Messrs. E. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. and the American Mission). When the disease first appeared the Mission Hospital had a few doses of anti-plague serum, with which the Europeans and a few domestics were promptly inoculated ; and after an unfortunate and rather unaccountable delav an additional stock was received in the Agency dispensary from the Parel Laboratory. Altogether, 137 persons were inoculated by Dr. Thorns of the Mission, and 155 by Assistant Surgeon Monani of the Victoria Memorial Hospital, attached to the Agency. A fair number of the more intelligent and educated members of the commercial community, who were personally known to the Political Agent, allowed themselves to be thus protected without any untoward results, as did also two sons of the Chief, and if a bigger stock of serum had been available when the epidemic was at its height, with seventy deaths a day, no doubt a much larger number of people would have submitted to the operation. The poorer classes resorted generally to flighty there being scarcely a Persian cooly left in the town of Manama during the hot weather and autumn of 1907, while the Shia Baharanis went over to Katif in consider able numbers at the same time. The cause of the outbreak has unfortunately remained in obscurity, as no steamer can be charged with having imported the infection from India. There is some reason for suspecting that the germs may have now ineradicably lodged in the islands themselves, and that the alternate years during which we are free from outbreaks may be due to the small number of rats which survive each epidemic. As the years 1904,1906 and 1908 have been healthy years, the advent of the spring of 1909 is being awaited with considerable anxiety, and it is prob able that many Hindus will absent themselves from the islands during the period of danger. The health of the mainland districts seems to have been good throughout the year. B ahrain. Political.—'Ihe relations of the Political Agent with the Chief and his family have been cordial throughoufcxthe year, though the magisterial and judicial officials of Manama and Muharraq (Bazar Masters and Kazis) who come in con tact with foreigners enjoying British protection, continue to require constant and strict supervision to restrain them from indulging in petty acts of tyranny and undue interference. It is satisfactory to report that in all cases of this nature brought to the notice of Sheikh Esa the promptest satisfaction, as demanded, has been accorded. A typical example of the lax method of governing the local tribes in vogue with the Sheikh occurred in June 1907, when the crews of two pearling boats, one manned by A1 bu Ealasa tribesmen, resident in Hadd, and the other by Dowasir of Budaiya', came into conflict over the question of priority in the matter of watering from the fresh-water spring on the Khor Easht reef, north west of Manama Harbour, with the result that one man on each side was shotAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. 97 dead. The Nakhodas of both the boats took their corrplalnts with due expedi tion to Sheikh Esa, but owing to intrigues with the Chief's servants and underhand negotiations with the various Kazis of importance, no judicial investigation was attempted, in spite of the Political Agent's repeated protests until January 1908. The usual excuse given was that one or the other party was engaged on the pearl-banks, and the result of the protracted delay was that the Al bu Falasa leaders, who had come to the conclusion that they were the most out of favour, went off in the autumn of 1907 to Katif to ask for Turkish protection, and subsequently on the same errand to Basrah, where, according to local gossip, they received a favourable reply. In January 1908, the Political Resident after discussing the case with the Political Agent, addressed an emphatic remonstrance to Shaikh Esa about the delay, pointing out the danger of allowing the feud to drag on unsettled into the next pearl ing season, and insisting on the necessity for taking serious notice of the breach of the maritime peace. Several weeks then elapsed, and the parties had only appeared once before the Head Kazi, when at last the Chief wrote to the Political Agent, early in the commencemeat of the current year, to the effect that the Al bu Falasa tribe had in fact defied him and were contemplating removal from Bahrain en masse. Some progress was then made with the case, but as it has not yet been definitely concluded the account of its settlement must be deferred to next year. In August 1907, the marriage was celebrated with considerable eclat of two young grand-children of the Chief. The bridegroom was Shaikh Khalifa, son of Shaikh Esa's eldest son, Salman, who died in 1893, and the bride was a daughter of Sheikh Rashid, the Chief's third son, who died in 1902. As the cause of both Salman and Eashid's death was tuberculosis, the augury for the young couple's future is not very promising. In the same month a Persian book-seller and contributor to Persian newspapers of articles, hostile to the British Government, named Agha Muhammad Ardakani, was expelled from Bahrain by the Chief, after the Political Agent had shown to the latter an example of the man's writings. In Kovember 1907, a serious fracas occurred in the Manama Bazar between some hundred Kowait divers and a number of Turkish military deserters, loafers and shop-keepers. The Kowait men recognized a Basri who had absconded a few years previously, when a diver, from one of their boats. After some days' pour parlers with the man who gave a surety, a converted Christian shop-keeper, for the satisfaction of any claims legally proved against him, the Kowaitis suddenly attempted, on the eve of their departure from Bahrain, to rush the defendant and his surety on board a boat without troubling about any legal formalities. The two men were rescued by their compatriots and in the ensuing scuffle seven Basris were severely wounded with knives and staves, while an equal number of Kowaitis received less severe contused wounds. All the injured men were brought to the Agency Hospital, and though the local feeling among the Sheikhs and other Arabs was at first strongly in favour of the Kowaitis, the excitement soon died down when the circumstances became generally known, and it was found that two of the Basris, who suffered from concussion of the brain, were in serious danger. It was arranged that the Basri injured men should remain in the hospital until the case came on for trial and was disposed of, while the Kowait leaders were made to execute a bond not to leave the port with any of their three boats for the same period. After the expiry of a fortnight, when only one Basrah man remained under treatment, the case was heard by the Chief Kazi, Shaikh Jasim- bin-Mahza', with the Agency Interpreter attending ; and after two sittings an amicable settlement was arrived at on the Kazi's suggestion, under which the Kowaitis paid the Basris Es. 300 as compensation for their severer injuries, and the incident was declared to be closed. On the 13th November 1907, the Persian Haji Abdun Nabi Kal Ewaz, who had been the Port Landing Contractor for cargo from steamers for several years, was dismissed from his post by the Chief for the apathy and neglect with which he had be3n carrying on his work, and the work was transferred to a Syndicate of Ewazi, (feunni) Persians whose chief agents are Abdul Aziz9g ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Khurrji and Abdul Karim-bin-Muliammad Khadim. After a little trouble at the time of change on account of the deficiency of boats, the new contractors were induced to purchase in their own name a sufficient number for the ordinary needs of the port, and the work has progressed satisfactorily since. The Infantry Guard of one Native officer and 26 Non-Commissioned Officers and men of the 108th Infantry (Muhammadans) were relieved by a detachment of one Native Officer and 28 Non-Commissioned Officers and men (Mahrattas and Muhammadans) of the 108th Infantry on the 3rd June 1907. This latter detachment leturned to India after relief by a similar party of the 112th Infantry (Jats) on the 25th October 1908. During the year under report little si^n was apparent of the secret trade in arms, which undoubtedly has not ceased to exist. There are some slight grounds for suspecting that the Persian clerks employed by Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. are not entirely innocent of connection with it, as they are extremely friendly with one of the leading operators who resides in Muharraq. In view of the pending Conference at Brussels, it was considered undesirable to search too closely for definite proofs of the guilt of the influential individuals who are believed to take part in the industry, as much unpleasantness will be avoided if the stoppage of the traffic can be effected within a reasonable time by action outside of Bahrein. On the 19th January 1908, 23 Afghans, who had been repulsed from Maskat, came ashore in Bahrein, and avoided returning to the mail-steamer in spite of the Political Agent's orders that they should do so. They were then brought in custody to the Agency, wbere their persons and effects were thoroughly searched, with the result that notes and cash amounting to Bs. 99,452 were temporarily taken away from them. The men were then kept under strict surveillance in a masjid outside the front gate of the Agency for a month, after which they seemed glad to leave for Bunder Abbas. They had missed one down-steamer, owing to her coming in after dark and leaving early the following morning in rough weather. With regard to the case of Shaikh Ali-bin-Ahmad, the Chief's nephew, who has been living in Bombay under police supervision since August 1905, it has transpired that during the earlier months of the year under report Shaikh Esa was being subjected to constant pressure by his peers, the Sultan of Maskst and the Chief of Koweit, as well as by the youthful members of his family to forgive the exile and approach the Government of India for the remission of the balance of the sentence. In the result a first reference was made to this Agency on the 26th September 1907, and, though the subsequent negotiations were delayed by the absence of the Political Agent on leave and by the advent of the month of Ramadhan, the question had progressed to the point of Shaikh Ali submitting certain conditions in writing, for the governing of his future conduct in January 1908. These conditions were slightly revised under instruc tions from the Political Eesident, and at the ch-se of the year the release and return of the detenu to Bahrein was becoming imminent. The Customs Administration of Bahrein was carried on this year without hitch, the Manager and Accountants being Hindus, while an Arab watched the management on behalf of the Chief. It is believed that Shaikh Esa has barely received a lakh of rupees as revenue from this source, though he has evinced no discontent, being satisfied probably that the diminution is totally attri butable to the slackness of trade. He characteristically contrived, however, to cut his coat to his cloth, by discouraging his Bedouin friends of the mainland from approaching him and refusing absolutely to send any of his subjects' boats over to provide them with free communication with the islands. The Turkish Postal forwarding Agent, Abdur Bahim -bin-Othman, men tioned in last year 's report, left Bahrein in haste and panic during the course of the plague epidemic, and did not return before the close of the year. His far from onerous duties were performed during his absence by two or three friends under, presumably, some private arrangement. Judicial. —Six hundred and ninety-four civil plaints and 234 criminal complaints were received and disposed of during the year under report.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1907-190S. 99 The number of civil cases is largely in excess of the 219 which were dealt with last year. It seems probable that this year's high figure will not generally he maintained, as the universal tightness of money has caused the pinch to be felt everywhere, and creditors have not been disposed to give their debtors extensions of time. The Majlis-al-Urfi have been very hardly worked, often meeting in the Agency two days a week for 6 or 6 hours at a time. A still heavier work has been entailed on both this office and the Majlis in connection with the winding up of the estates of 22 persons who died of plague, owing money to individuals of various nationalities. In such cases, the shops, and houses with cash, ornaments and other valuables have been inspected by a representative of the Agency in conjunction with the Bazar Master or his Deputy. Everything has been listed and promptly sealed up, and eventually disposed of under the orders of the Ma jlis, unless the relations or friends of the deceased, as happened in 6 cases, undertook to pay all claims in full. In the case of a Hindu goldsmith, a total of nearly 200 creditors (including depositors of gold and ornaments) and debtors had to be interviewed for the verification of the accounts. In several other cases as many as 50 and 60 persons have been similarly dealt with. Accounts have often had to be translated, and creditors and debtors in foreign ports communicated with. Thus the bare statement that this Agency had to collect and pay out sums of money amounting to about Es. 25,000 during the year, entirely fails to give a proper idea of the work performed. The 16 persons, whose estates were realized and whose outstandings were paid out by the Majlis, working through the Agency and Bazar Master, were as follows ;— One British subject, 5 Persian subjects, including a Hew, and 10 Bahrain subjects. The 6 deceased persons, whose connections were authorized to act as executors, were 1 British subject, 4 Turkish subjects, including one Jew, and 1 Bahrain subject.

Sheikh Hamad-bin-Esa spent 10 days of July on the Katar Peninsula shooting. He was met by Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani, at a spot near the west coast and escorted to Lusail, Sheikh Jasim's residence, where he, with reluctance probably, was introduced to Sheikh Nasir-bin-Mubarak, the ' Pretender' of Bahrain. Sheikh Hamad again left Bahrain for Linga on the 21st December and returned on the 25th January. Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Esa spent 20 days in Katar during December 1907. On the 26tli October 1907 Sheikh Abcallah-bin-Esa, the Chiefs third surviving son, proceeded on pilgrimage to Mecca in the SS. Madura. He was accompanied by his mother, the Chief's only living wife, and by Sheikh Abdur Rahman-bin-Abdul Wahhab, the Waair (-Land Agent). T?he party returned to Bahrain, safe and sound, on the 13th Pebrnary 1908, in the S,S Hoseinee and landfed ulnder a salute of 8 guns from the shore batteries of Manama and Muharraq, the Agency steam launch having been borrowed by the Chief to tow them near the shore. Slave Trade. —Sixteen slaves took refusre in the Aseney during the year. Twelve of these received manumission certificates from the Political Agent. One was manumitted voluntarily by his master. One died of plague and the remaining two, an elderly woman and-a young boy, left the Agency of their own accord to return to their miasters. K atar. The peace of the Katar Peninsula has been undisturbed by any serious event throughout the year ; the minds of all men were thoroughly depressed by the continued absence of any sign of expansion in the price of pearls and the want of ready money has compelled everyone to economize as far as pos sible. The best offer received by Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani in June 1907 for the pearls which he had actually purchased for Rs. 1,20,00,000, was Bs. 60,00,000, and in fact shortly after the close of the year under report, he has settled with his creditors that they shall receive from him one and ail only K. /and the maskat political agency for the year 1907-190&amp;. 101 50 per cent, of the monies due to fUem, and this too only when the pearls have been actually sold and paid for. The price of fearls at the present day is said to have fallen approximately to the rates which existed 10 years ago. In September 1907 a short-lived estrangement arose between Sheikh Abdallah-bin-Jasim and his cousins, the sons of the late Governor of Doha Ahmad, but this was quickly overcome by Sheikh Jasim who went personally to Doha for the purpose of settling it. In December 1907 some friction also oecurred at 'Wakra between the A1 bu'Ainain tribe and Sheikh Abdur Eahman-bin-Jasim, the Governor of the town, in consequence of the latter's inconsiderate attempt to enforce the pay ment of the boat tax at an inconvenient time against a notable of the tribe by imprisoning him. The latter's son attempted to shoot the Shaikh, but was frus trated by his mother, after which he was arrested and imprisoned in place of his father. The trouble was satisfactorily allayed by Shaikh Jasim^ who interceded for the offender and procured his forgiveness and release in return for the payment of the tax. Sheikh Abdallah-bin-Jasim A1 Thani arrived in Bahrein on the 3rd April 1907 en route for Bombay to investigate personally on his father's behalf the state of the pearl market. He put up in the town of Manama a number of days, and also stayed with Sheikh Esa and seme of the minor Sheikhs of the A1 Khalifa family as their guest for short periods. Having exchanged visits with the Political Agent, he was furnished with letters of introduction to the Government and Customs authorities in Bombay and permission was obtained for his party to continue wearing and carrying their arms while in India. The Sheikh left for Bombay on the 13th April and returned on the 29th July to Manama, whence he proceeded immediately to his home at Doha, having failed to sell any of his own or his father's pearls. In June 1907 Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani inaugurated the maintenance of a custom house in Doha under the management of one of his slaves, with an Arab acting as Treasurer. The stated reason for the innovation was the deficit in the Bin Thanis' income caused by the depreciation of pearls. The people of Katar have hitherto been much opposed to a step of this nature and the attempt of the Turkish Government to establish a custom house at Doha in 1890 was successfully resisted. Their quiet acquiescence now is doubtless attributable to their sympathy for the Shaikh's pecuniary misfortunes. In January 1908, Sheikh .Jasim-bin-Thani, who possesses the common Arab proclivity for interfering in other people's affairs and who had been unsuccess fully appealing to the Turkish authorities of Hasa to settle a blood-feud between two large factions of the towns people of 'Ayun, named the A1 Awda and A1 Mubanna, in a certain manner, convened a meeting of the Bani Hajir and Manasif headaien at Lusail to discuss the feasibility of assisting the A1 Awda by force of arms. The project of course was not a serious one, but it was intended by the movemem to impress the Turks with the necessity for some sort of action. A deputation of A1 Awda had also called on the Political Agent in Bahrein the preceding May, but had received no encourage ment as regards British intervention, H asa, K atip and the adjacent tpibal territories. The affairs of the Hasa and Katif Oases and the relations between the settled populations and the surrounding Bedouin have been unsettled through out the year. Caravans on the road between Ojair and Hofuf were attacked in October and November 1907, and in March 1908 by Ajman and Manasir tribesmen, and an affray occurred in September in the outer harbour of Katif between Saihat boatmen and Bani Hajir Bedouin, when the latter were accused of an attempt at piracy. The townspeople of Mubarraz supporting S^'dun Pasha, were at log gerheads with the Turkish officials in January 1908, although Sad'un had been up to Basrah in the previous April, to make his peace with the ^ ali. In the last fracas, the Turks were able to gain a qualified victory, destroying2Q2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY 20 houses by cannon fire and compelling Sadan to give compensation for the stores and cash, 2,000 dollars, looted from the Government. An unpopular Turkish officer, Tabur Agashi, Mahmud Beg, who hud been recalled from Hasa in 1906 and had made several futile efforts subse quently to get the people to concur in his return, having forced his way back in January 1908, was promptly shot dead in the Hofuf J^azar by four men who were believed to belong to Mubarraz. The previous year's Mutasarrif, Najib Pasha, returned to Basrah in Au^t 1907, and was succeeded by Rashid Pasha in the following October. In Katif at the commencement of the year Mansur-bin-Ahmad-bin-Mahdi a lonal magnate and the rival of Haji Mansur Pasha, was acting as QairQmaqam , He was soon relieved by a Turk named Ahmad Effendi who officiated untii February or March 1908, when he was relieved by Muhammad Amin-biu- Sultan, the present incumbent. In June 1907, in consequence of rumours having reached Bahrain of the pirate Ahmad-bin-Salman showing some activity in the neighbourhood of Katif, the Commander of H.M.S. L tpwing was requested by the Political Resident to proceed to the port and enquire of the Qaimmaqam whether he had any news of the outlaw^ whereabouts and what measures he was taking against him. The Lapwing did not touch at Bahrein on account of the prevalence of plague. On arrival at Katif, Lieutenant Commander Gouldsmith received a most unfriendly reception, being prevented by an armed guard at the landing stage from advancing and meeting the Qaimmaqam. 'ihe incident lias since formed the subject of a strong representation to the Porte by the London Foreign Office, and subsequent to the close of the year under report, a satisfactory apology has been presented to the Commander by Ahmad EfTendi's successor, who went on board the Lapwing on her next arrival in the port and expressed his regret for the incident in writing as well as verbally. Darwish Effendi, mentioned in last year's report as having been removed from the post of Treasury Officer, Katif, in 1906, was reappointed to the same office in April 1907. The Customs farm of Hasa, Katif and Ojair was sold for the year com mencing i4th March 1907, to the same contractors as before for 13,000 Turkish Liras ; this shows a decrease of 3,000 Liras on the previous year's price. P iracies. No piracies occurred during the year under report, though rumours of the movements of the professional, Ahmad-bin-Salman, occasionally filtered to Bahrain. It seems that dissensions were rife amongst his friends in the early part of the hot weather, which hindered their putting out to sea and interfered perhaps with their system of gaining intelligence. The frequent presence of a gun-boat in the neighbourhood of Bahrain had also undoubtedly a deterrent effect upon the lawless Bedouin and their leader. P olitical R esident's and N aval C ommander-in- C hief's V isits. Major P. Z. Cox, C.I E., and Commodore Sir G. S. Warrender, Bart., C.B., M.V.O., readied Bahrein on the 16th April 1907, in H.M.S.

Lawrence, bringing the Naval Command- an( ^ Political Resident, paid a brief visit to Bahrein on the 16th April 1907, both vessels leaving on the following day.and the maskat political agency foe the yeab 1907-1908. In connection with tlie suppression of piracy H.M.S. Redbreast arrived on the 23rd July 1907, and remained till the 6th August, when she left for Bushire. She returned again on the 11th August, but left for Basrah on the 17th. H.M.S. Lapwing arrived to take her place on the 31st August and remained in Baherin waters till the 14th September, when all likelihood of piracies occurring seemed to have subsided. On the 6th December 1907, the Indo-European Telegraph Department steamer Patrick Stewart arrived with the Officiating Director on board, and anchored for a few hours while Mr, Campbell came ashore to see the proposed site for a telegraph building. On the 12th January 1908, the R.I.M.S. Lawrence came over from Bushire, with the new Agency launch [Bahrein in tow. She proceeded on the following day to the Trucial Oman coast, taking the Agency Interpreter, Mr. Inam al Hak, on a temporary deputation. Movements of the Political Agent. The Political Agent spent about 32 days in camp durins» the year in different parts of the islands. In August 1907 the Political Agent paid a hasty visit to Bushire in H. M, S. Redbreast. In September and October 1907, Captain Prideaux availed himself of 6 weeks' privilege leave to India. On the 21st December 1907, the Political Agent proceeded to Bushire, returniug to Bahrein on the 12th January 1908. Visits of Officials and other Europeans. On the 13th April 1907, Mr. C. Wills arrived from England to relieve Mr. H. S. Milborrow, proceeding on furlough, of the charge of the local branch of Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. Mr. Milborrow returned to Bahrein just before the close of the year, and Mr. W ills was then transferred to Basrah. Several changes were made in the personnel of the American Arabian Mission during the year, in consequence of the Eev. J. Moerdyk proceeding home on furlough and Mrs. Vogel being transferred to Basrah. The new comers, who relieved each other at different periods, were the Rev. James Cantine accompanied by Mrs. Cantine, from Maskat, and the Rev. J. Van Ess, the Rev. P. J. Barny, Mr. D. Dykstra (lay teacher), Dr. A. K, Bennett, Dr. H. R. L. Worrell and Miss Scardefield, all from Bssrah. Mons. Victor Rosenthal, of the Parisian firm of pearl-merchants, arrived on the 9th September and left for Europe on the 9th December 1907. He stayed this year with Mr. Bahnson of Messrs. R, Wonckhaus &amp; Co., as a paying guest. Different reports state that he spent 3^ lakhs and 6 lakhs on his purchases. Mons. Elbaz of Maskat, who is called by the Arabs Ibrahim and is under stood to be a nephew of Mons. Goguyer of Maskat, arrived in Bahrein on the 8th November and left on the 23rd idem. He put up with Haji Muqbil adh Dhakair, the pearl and rice merchant. The apparent object of his visit was to set going a new contrivance for raising water from a well, imported from Prance by Haji Muqbil through Mons. Goguyer. On the 15th December 1907, Mr. Laffere, Assistant Engineer, Public Works Department, arrived from Bunder Abbas for a week to inspect the Agency buildings and the Postmaster's bouse, and on the 25th January Mr. E. Greene, Superintendent of Post Offices, Karachi and Persian Gulf Divisions, came to Bahrein on his annual inspection tour. Other casual and hasty visitors to Bahrein were Mr. Brown of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Professor Oestrup, Ph.D. (a Dane), and a German architect proceeding to Baghdad, in November 1907 ; a German commercial agent named Kurt Jung in February 1908; and Messrs. C. H.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT o£ TtTE KOWfilT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR THE YEAR 1907-1908. N ejd A ffairs. During the first-lialf of the year under report, cofitinuotis eontradictnry rumours were received of fighting between the two powers of Central Arabia. Bin Rashid appears to have been at the Zenith of his power aboiifc September- when he entered Boraida with the support of the townspeople and the powerful Umtair tribe. The latter, headed by their Sheikh Paisal, Were smarting under losses sustained by them in a fight with Bin Sa'ud's levies that took place in April under the walls of Majma', in which town they to&amp;k refuge. A messenger from Sheikh Mubarak, Abdu Aziz A1 Hassan, was sent from Koweit in September ostensibly to make peace between the two parties. It would appear, however, that he lulled the suspicions of Sultan-bin-Rashid', detached the Umtair and then called up Hn Sa'ud to fight. The final result of the operations round Boraida was the decline of Sultan's power and the ruler of Riadh is now in undisturbed possession. News during the last part of the year has been meagre and Central Arabia appears to have been enjoying a period of comparative tranquillity. The despatch of Abdul Aziz A1 Hassan and the general trend of events have given rise to the assumption—by no means unwarranted—that the distur bances of this year were skilfully engineered by Sheikh Mubarak, He wished to show the ruler of Riadh that he could not afford to stand independent Of Koweit support and yet, at the critical moment, when Bin Sa'ud was seriously threatened. Sheikh Mubarak threw his tveight into the opposite scale and has, for the time being, completely destroyed the power of the Bin Rashid family, who, he probably fully realises, are irreconcileable enemies. T ribal P olitics. Thaffir.'—'News was received in the close of April of the death of Ja'ilan-bin-Swait, who was succeeded by his young son, Mohamed-bin-Ja'ilan. His uncle, Hamud, is said to manage the tribal affairs. Ajman. —Muhammad-bin-Hithlain was released in May, ais full repara tion had been made for the depredations committed by the tribe against the Koweit Bedouins. This man now appears to have had his position as Sheikh of the Ajman acknowleged by the Turkish authorties at El Hasa. Vmtair. —This tribe has been much in evidence during the year and mention has already been made of them under Nejd Affairs. There was trouble between them and the Bani Thwaihy, a branch of the Thaffir, who are on specially friendly relations with Koweit and Sheikh Mubarak, called on the Umtair to restore the property they had raided. As a punishment for not doing so and also, no doubt, for the pro minent part he took against Abdul Aziz-bin-Sa'ud at Boraida, Paisul ad Dowish, the Sheikh of the Elwa Umtair, was imprisoned by Sheikh Mubarak all the last half of November. He was not released until the fine decreed by Sheikh Mubarak had been collected. Other raids of lesser importance were reported, but everything goes to show that the Sheikh of Koweit still retains undoubted authority over the neighbouring Bedouin tribes. N avy. About the middle of April, His Excellency Commodore Sir George Warrender, Bart, C. B., M. V. O., visited Koweit. He was accom panied by the Resident, Persian Gulf. On arrival, the Political Agent, accom panied by Sheikh Jabirinthe absence of his father, went to welcome His Excellency on board the H. M. S. Eyacinth. Sheikh Jabir on leaving the ship received a salute of 5 guns. In the evening His Excellency the106 ■administeation eepoet of the peesian gulp political residency, Commodore and the Political Resident landed and an informal visit was my to Sheikh Jahir, who took His Excellency and his party round the town of Kowcit. On the following day, Sheikh Mubarak returned from Sirra, where he had been for some days, and His Excellency paid him an official visit accompanied bv the Political Resident, the Political Agent and the Plag Lieutenant of H M S Rvacinth. The visit was returned at the Agency house by the OhAilrb himself, who then left for Sirra and invited His Excellency and Ms mrtf There. In the evening. His Excellency, the Political Resident and the officers of the flagship accompanied by the Political Agent and Mrs. Knox and Sheikh Jabir rode to Sirra. His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and his nartv were met at two miles from Sheikh Mubarak's camp by the younger members of the Sheikh's family and about 40 Bedouin horsemen who galloped across the line backwards and forwards shouting the Subah war cry and firins: rifles. Sheikh Mubarak himself met the Commodore's party about half a mile from his tents. The whole cavalcade then rode on and were received in a large Persian tent. Here the guests were treated to light refreshment during whi-h time speeches suitable to the occasion were exchanged between the Commodore and the Sheikh. A display of beautiful Omani dromedaries and droves of the Sheikh 's riding camels were an interesting feature of the visit. Dinner, of which the Sheikh himself partook, was then served to the party in EUr0 The n flagship with His Excellency left for Bahrein on the 15th April. During the year the following ships of His Majesty's Navy visited the port: year H. M. S. Proserpine once, H. M. S. Lapwing twice, H. M. 3. Redbreast once, H. M. S. Sphinx 4 times, the R.I.M.S. Lawrence thrice, the I. G. T. S. E. Fatrich Stewart once in November. On the 31st March the R. E. L. Surprise arrived. Visits were exchanged between the Commandant of the ship and the Political Agent. The Commandant and two other officers of the ship visited Sheikh Mubarak. The Political Agent was present at the end of the visit. f yhLWMjif V isits and T ours. The Political Resident visited Koweit thrice during the year. During the winter, two tours were made by the Political Agent in the Koweit hinterland. His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah was visited at Christmas, and on the way opportunity was taken to visit the new Sheikh of Zubair, Muhammad- bin-Misbri, an old acquaintance of the Political Agent who was elected Sheikh by the inhabitants of Zubair after the assassination of Khalid al'Aon in the streets of Basrah on the 19th November. A visit was also paid during the Political Agent's stay at Basrah to Sheikh Khazal of Muhammerah at Eailiya, with whom Sheikh Mubarak was staying at the time. An interesting detour to the west on the return journey made some slight additions to our knowledge of the vexed geographical problem of the course of the Batia. No visible signs of further encroachment on Koweit boundaries by the Turks . was detected. In Eebruary, the Political Agent moved southwards and reached the village of Anta'a about 150 miles south of Koweit. He was well received by the Sheikh and inhabitants who unsolicited expressed their allegiance to and affection for the Sheikh of Koweit. No untoward incident marred the journey which was a severe test for the camel transport. Service in the escort is now greatly sought after and the scheme is working well. C ustoms. The Customs Administration was managed by the Sheikh's slave, Aman, up to 17th January 1908, when he was cast into prison and all his belongings confiscated by the Sheikh for misappropriating customs revenue andand the maskat political agency for the year 1907-1908. purchasing landed property in his son's name in Basrah. Prom the 18th January the management of the Customs was entrusted to the head tally clerk, Abdul Mohsin, a Koweit bred Arab. There were no complaints until the latter part of the year when the Sheikh enhanced the Customs dues to 4 per cent, on the invoice value on all goods imported and 10 per cent on certain gods such as sugar, tea, etc. The duty on firearms, however, remains unaltered which is $6 per rifle and $2 again if exported. Goods are now subject to examination of the Customs premises prior to the levy of duty The enhanced rates of duty are unpopular among the trading folk as formerly duty was levied per package and per 100 bags irrespective of value of goods and goods were not inspected at the Customs. Aman has been pardoned and reduced to a common guardsman to the Sheikh. The landing charges, which are quite distinct from Customs have been changed. The table below shows the alteration : Old rates. Revised rates. For every 100 bags sugar • . . . . „ „ 100 „ rice » 4 „ coffee ... .... and for every other package .... \ /~W»T- 1 r\ 'V* S\ 4- 4- I-, -3 r- _ J /• I* $ 20 8 1 2 20 10 1 1 coolies and the rest is handed over to the Sheikh. In former days when Aman was in charge, the Customs revenue entirely remained with him and the Sheikh only issued drafts on Aman for sums required by him. Aman used to pay Customs officials, and also paid hire of lighters and coolies But this arrangement has been changed since January, when it was found that Aman was misusing the Customs money. The Customs revenue, as soon as it is collected is paid over to the Sheikh himself and all transactions are made entirely under h,s personal supervision. The landing charges also, when collected, Ire paid into the Sheikh s co&amp;ers. The landing contractor only pays wages of coolies o? •, L lre . 0 . ' ' s au&lt; ' the rest of the Customs i staMishment is paid hv tiip Sheikh or his representative. ■ y e Arms Trade. Arms traffic has flourished during the year. Though the importation of this commodity into Koweit by the British India steamers is very ^mall the trade is nevertheless on the increase for merchants now import arms from Maskat in country craft. r -d ,- i Th&lt; ; ! ew 'ems. of smuggling and other notes which came under the Political Agent s notice may be of interest. In April news reached Koweit to the effect that the Turkish authorities were actively stopping the smuggliog of arms into Turkish Arabia, A JSTeidi by name Saleh, who was taking a fairly large consignment through Sefwan fell m with the Turkish soldiers. They asked him where he was bound for and he replied to Zubair. In spite of £T40 which he offered as a bribe to the Commandant, Saleh was arrested, the £T40 confiscated and he and his rifles taken off to Basrah. It was said then that Turkish soldiers were stationed round Zubair stopping all the roads to prevent smuggling of arms. Monsieur Elbaz and Monsieur Vram, said to be Frenchmen, visited Kowmt during the year. Elbaz was said to be a nephew of Monsieur Goguver Oi. Maskat and Monsieur Vram belonged to a different firm, also of Maskat Iney both came to collect outstanding money. Monsieur Elbaz while frv KoTVeit, remitted, in two instalments, to the French Bank in'Bombav Ks. 52,000 and Monsieur Vram Hs. 10,000 to Maskat. ^ It would appear that Sheikh Mubarak was personally interested in arms trade and connected with the firm of Monsieur Goguyer Monsieur -blbaz s presence in Koweit was brought to the notice of the Sheikh hnf h* professed to be unaware of the fact. Elbaz, while in Koweit, went under the name of Ibrahim. It seems he had come armed with a letter of introduction c 2jqg administration report of the persian gulf political residency from the Sultan of Maskat who alleged that lie was a Mnsalman convert and had come to settle accounts with Ali-bin Ahmed uth Tbahaha and Sheikh Moosa -bin-A.bdur Kazak, who were Agents for the firm of Gognyer. One morning early in October, however, Sheikh Mubarak sent his Secretary with Monsieur Elbaz to the Political Agent with the request that he would be good enough to witness Elbaz s signature to a certain document but the nature of the document was not made clear. The Political Agent declined the honour and visited the Sheikh when the latter told the Political Agent that he owed some money to the firm of Gcguyer and that he was finally settling and severing his connection with the firm and wished that he would kindly see that Monsieur Elbaz signed a document to that effect. Both the Frenchmen lived, while in Koweit, with one Dahash-bin-Othman tin Dahash. In June Sheikh Mubarak despatched a consignment of 4,000 rifles and ammunition to Sheikh Khazal of xVlohammerah to help him in his troubles with his tribesmen. In September some packages of arms were shipped for Koweit from Maskat by one of the fast mail steamers of British India. The steamer unfortunately could not call at Koweit and the packages remained on board. On arrival at Mohammerah, however, the Belgian Customs officials boarded the vessel and demanded the packages from the Captain of the vessel. This was refused and the packages were taken back and handed over to the Sultan of Maskat. The Sheikh of Koweit preferred a complaint to the Political Agent complaining of unjustifiable interference by the Belgian officials of the Persian Customs Department at Mohammerah with goods destined for Koweit and asked the Political Agent to arrange for the re-shipment of the packages from Maskat. The matter was referred to the Political Agent at Maskat through the Political 'Resident, Persian Gulf, with the result that such an arrangement was found impracticable. On three occasions cases of rifles were dropped over board in the Koweit harbour while discharging in lighters, and enquiries were made by the owners from the Mail Agent as to the exact spot of anchorage with a view to sendinsr down divers^ In October again the Sheikh despatched to Bin Sa'ud, who had applied for such help, 16,000 cartridges (8 camel loads). In a single week in October 6.000 rifles were imported an.d the Sheikh's dues on them amounted to £5,000 or Rs. 75,000. In November there was a great activity in the arms traffic when the rate of dollars was driven up sud denly to Rs. 169 for $1C0. Ihe buyers were said to be from Mesopotamia who had with them Turkish Liras which had to be changed into dollars. It is interesting to note that one early morning an unsuspecting Arab from up country, who had probably come to buy arms, greeted the Political Agent in the bazar, misled probably by his solar hat, and asked him if he had any arms for sale. A report, in the same month, was brought to the effect that three loads of arms and ammunition, the property of Dahash-bin-Othman-bin-Dahash, were captured by Turkish soldiers at Zubair. In March, three revolvers and one rifle, all Mausers, were detected in the bedding of one Haji Hamud, who was a passenger for Koweit from Maskat, by the Chief Officer of the British India mail steamer These were confis cated by the officer and handed over to the Political Agent at Maskat. Preference is given to Mauser rifles and revolvers as these are considered to be the best. After these come the firearms manufactured by Dixon and Company and arms bearing the Persian ensign locally called the Pharsi ' rifles. A Mauser rifle is sold at $70 but prices generally keep fluctuating as the dollar rates fall and rise. Rifles made by Dixon and Company can be had for $35 and less. The ^ 'Pharsi &gt;, rifle is better than that made by Dixon and Com pany and is sold for $40 to 45. It is considered to be the second best. Public Health. The public health has been good throughout the year. The dispensary was kept open for the benefit of the public and 5,914 persons were treated.and the maskat political agency for the year 1907-1908. 109 The daily atterdance of sick persons averaged 62. f ihe charge of the dispen sary was held by Assistant Surgeon Uaudur Eabman from 1st April to 8th August 1907, when he proceeded to India on transfer handing over' charge to Assistant Surgeon Dadimaster. Marine. The steamers of the British India Company (fast and slow mails alternately) called weekly, but on eight occasions the fast mails proceeded to Basrah without calling at Koweit necessitating local arrangements to convey outward mail to Pao and bring in the inward mails from that place. These frequent failures have caused much inconvenience to the public and to the Political Agent himself. The local agent of the British India Company has been permitted by the Sheikh to hoist a flagstaff on his house on which he shows a light on Wednesday evenings. A similar light is shown by the Political Agent and these lights prove of some slight assistance to the fast mails entering the port. Two steamers of other companies visited this port during the year. First S. S. Waltham (owners Messrs. V. T. Thompson &amp; Co., Sunderland, and) chartered by an Arab firm in Basrah, and second S. S. Nasri of the Bombay and Persian S. N. Company. The former vessel took away a cargo of 560 tons wheat for London and the Nasri brought a cargo of 50 cases petroleum for the Sheikh's motor car and 15 packages other merchandise. The latter Com pany have, it is said, arranged to send their vessels once a month to this port at present and thereafter bi-weekly. Haji Abdul Karim Behbani of the house of Marafi, of Persian extraction, has been appointed agent. The lighter S. S. John O.Scott of the latter Ccmyany also called at this port from Basrah with a cargo of 3 } 0C0 bags Basrah rice. Pearl Fisheries. The Ceylon pearl fishery being too small no Arab divers were required from Koweit this season. And before the news was received from Ceylon, the Sheikh had issued orders prohibiting Koweit divers from going to the Ceylon pearl fisheries on the plea that they did not gain much by going there and that, when they went, they returned from Ceylon weakened from disease and therefore could not work at their own fisheries at Bahrein. Piracy. The particulars of a savage and revolting act of piracy committed on a Koweit dhow were communicated, at the instance of Sheikh Mubarak, to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, by this Agency. The culprits were known as the Awlad-i-Bumaidi and were wanted ' for several other atrocities. They were captured on the Persian coast by His Majesty's ships and brought to Koweit for final identification and eventually taken to Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, by whom they were interned for life. Much gratification was expressed in Koweit at the capture of these notorious offenders. Flagstaff. The new flagstaff supplied by the Marine Department was erected in January and the old one that was on the Agency house cut down. Some distaste was shown by the Arabs and especially by the inhabitants of the houses adjoining the Agency, but Sheikh Mubarak was whole-heartedly in our favour and was ready with offers of assistance of every kind. Relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent. With the tightening of the bonds between the Sheikh and the British Government, a marked and most satisfactory improvement has taken place in the relations between the Sheikh and the British representative. Even in past years, if allowance was made for the difficulties of Sheikh Mabarak's posi tion, there was always a decided balance in our favour and it was permissible to conclude that Sheikh Mubarak was at least far more attached to the Britishj10 administration report of the persian gulf political residency Government than he was to any other power. There is now, however, no room for doubt and, though it would be idle to pretend that friction never occurs harmonious relations have beeu the rule and the signs of increased confidence and a desire to please are evident in every direction. [Nor is this improvement confined to the Sheikh only. The prestige of the Agency has undonbtedlv increased and it would not be too much to say that the Agency is now regarded with approval by almost all classes of the population. Service of one kind and another is eagerly sought after, petty street insults no longer occur and the name of ' quarantine ' no longer calls down curses on the British representative and his staff. It is interesting to note that the Sheikh has taken into his employ an Englishman, Mr. Henry Kemp, who is the engineer of the Sheikh's yacht. Be is a quiet unassuming man who seldom moves out of his ship but he seems to suit Sheikh Mubarak thoroughly well. The Sheikh has also during the year imported a motor car of French manufacture from Bombay. An Indian chauffeur (Musalman) was engaged ona three months' agreement. After the expiry of the agreement the chauffeur was allowed to return to India. The motor car is now looked after and driven by one of the men in the Sheikh's employ, his coachman Ali, who has something of a turn for mechanics. P ublic B uildings. During the year under report, Sheikh Mubarak has built a very fine suite of reception rooms in front of his old house. They are on the top of the old stables. The rooms are well furnished in European style. The Sheikh has also changed his flagstaff. The new staff is on higher ground and very much higher than the old one. It tops everything in the town except the Agency flagstaff. E oreigners. The visits of Messrs. Elbaz and Vram have been already noted under ' Arms Trade. ' Their movements were watched during the time they remained in Koweit. A Mr. G. Guays of English parentage, a convert to Islam, arrived in Koweit about the middle of June and wished to travel in Central Arabia. He was, however, advised by the Political Agent not to do so as it was risky and dangerous to travel in those parts. He disguised himself as a Turk and called himself Abdulla. He remained in Koweit for some time and at last seeing that he could not carry out his intentions finally left for Bombay by a British India steamer. He was formerly in the employ of that Company and his present profession is that of a mining engineer. Butirbin-Rashid of the Sheikhs of Dubai arrived in March and was the Sheikh of Koweit's guest during the time he remained in Koweit. He visited Sheikh Khazal of Muhammerah with Sheikh Mubarak and returned to Dubai via Koweit and Maskat. While in Koweit, Buti-bin-Rashid paid a visit to the Political Agent, which was duly returned. Q uarantine. Owing to the outbreak of plague in Bahrein islands, quarantine was imposed by the Sheikh on all steam and sailing vessels arriving from that port until the end of July when Bahrein was declared a free port. The services of the Assistant Surgeon were placed at the disposal of the Sheikh for quarantine duty. Quarantine restrictions are only imposed now on pas sengers arriving by fast mails of the British India Company from Karachi. While it would be premature to suppose that quarantine is regarded with favour in Koweit, the bitter prejudice, excited by its very name in the begin ning, is now much less in evidence and the Sheikh's officials co -operate much more readily than they used to. Much, however, remains to be done before quarantine can be pronounced satisfactory.and the maskat political agency for the year 1907-1908. Ill S heikh M ubarak. Sheikh Mubarak has continued to be on friendly terms with the Turkish officials except towards the end of the year when there was some trouble at Fao. The Turkish soldiers in the Fort at Fao broke open the Sheikh's bunds which protected his T?ao date plantations and let in the flood water causing thereby considerable damage to the property. The matter was brought to the notice of His Excellency the Wali of Basrah, who took no steps in the matter. The matter is still hanging fire and the Sheikh has approached the Political Agent and the Political Resident with a view to a settlement of this trouble some question. The Sheikh has paid frequent visits to the Sheikh of Mohammerah during the year. In June when the latter was in trouble with his riverain tribes—the Bani Turuf—Sheikh Mubarak himself proceeded to help his friend. A large quantity of firearms and provisions were taken to M ohammerah. Some of the younger members of the Sheikh's family also went there but Sheikh Jabir strongly objected to his father's doings as being risky and hazardous. The Sheikh returned to Koweit after a few days' absence at Mohammerah and reported to the Political Agent that the Bani Turuf had made an attack on Sheikh KhazaPs troops but were repulsed with heavy loss. Sheikh Mubarak then intervened and peace was restored. In July the Sheikh was in treaty for a date garden from Sa'adun of the Muntafich near the Zain property and opposite Mohammerah for £T8 5 000 but interference on the part of the Turkish authorities annulled the bargain greatly to the Sheikh's annoyance. In June the Sheikh discharged his Secretary, Moolla Abdulla, for insubor dination and altering certain documents contrary to his orders. Moolla Abdulla was replaced by Abdul Aziz -bin-Salim-bin-Bedar, who was for so long imprisoned by the Turks and was formerly the Sheikh's agent in Basrah. There is no doubt that Abdul Aziz is a farlmore capable man and the Sheikh's correspondence is now intelligible which it used not to be in the days of Moolla Abdulla. Owing to the previous year's heavy exactions, few Koweitis went on pilgrimage and the Haj consisted mostly of Najada, Bedouins and strangers. There were practically no Koweit townsmen and the true pilgrims numbered from 40 to 60 in all. Political changes. The charge of the Agency was held by Major S. G. Knox throughout the year. S. G.

A rabia.ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY increased the number of caravan robberies and rendered the settlement of outstanding claims more difficult to achieve than ever. At the beginning of the year the Province of Fars was in a state of absolute anarchy, but when His Imperial Highness the Zil-es-Sultan was appointed Governor-General in March, matters mended considerably During His Imperial Highness's short administration, the roads became temporarily safe and the province was quieted as if by magic. Unfortu nately the Zil was removed from office after the Shah's coup d'etat apparently because his adherents at Tehran had been intriguing with the Constitutional Party and left for Europe in July. His Excellency the Asaf- ed-Dowleh having been appointed Governor-General sent his Deputy, Sardar Firuz, to take charge, and did not himself arrive till September. His Excellency nominally retained the post of Governor-General till the end of the year, but has shown himself absolutely incapable of governing Fars and the province has remained in complete anarchy since the departure of the Zil. wraz. Tlle Resident visited Shiraz arriving there in June during the Zil-es- Sultan's reign and leaving in October after the arrival of the Asaf-ed-Dowleh. The principal subjects in Mr. Bill's interesting report on Fars are— (1) The extraordinary effect produced by the nomination of His Imperial Highness the Zil-es-Sultan to the Governor-General ship simply owing to his reputation as a ruler who had no use for rose-water methods. (2) The treacherous murder of the Motamid-i-Diwan by the Arab Chief Asghar Khan in revenge for the former's share in the murder of the KoWam-ul-Mulk in March 1908. (3) The apathy with which the Shiraz populace received the news of the fall of the Constitution. (4) The rise of Seyyid Abdul Hussain Lari as Nationalist leader in Lar. With these topics Mr. Bill has dealt very thoroughly and further com ment from me is superfluous. Bushire and ^ as town of Bushire was concerned it was most noticeable that Persian coast, during all the disturbances in other parts of Persia it was tranquil. The Bushiri of course regards his town as distinct from Persia and all the current generation wants is some reasonably just form of government under which he can pursue his business avocations undisturbed. At the beginning of the period under review, the local assembly which had been formed nearly two years after those in other parts of Persia, was in full swing. Under the presidency of a disreputable petty trader named Mirza Ali, it interfered with every matter, great and small. During its regime therefore it was even more difficult to settle cases than ever. The average Bushiri became very tired of the Majlis and of the busy-bodies composing it and when it was eventually abolished as a result of the Shah's coup d'etat, the people viewed its demise—mot merely with apathy as the Shirazis—but with undisguised relief. The principal matters of interest mentioned in my report for Bushire (annexed) are— (1) Lingah affairs including the revival of the question of the protec tion of Bahreinis. (2) The question of the flying of German flags by dhows, and the regularization of the conditions under which the British flag can be flown by persons under British protection on their sailing craft. Ahwaz. (1) The finding of oil by the Concessions Syndicate at Maidan Manaftun. (2) Messrs. Lynch Brothers' renewed efforts to build a shed at Sha aili.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. (3) The affairs of the Bakhtiaris. (4) The taking over of the Borasjun-Ahwaz telegraph line by the Indo-European Telegraphs. In regard to the operations of the Oil Syndicate, it may be noted that as a result of the Indian guard being sent to Maidan Manaftun, and the with- 1° o e t 0 kb® Khans, no trouble has occurred this year between the Oil Syndicate's representatives and the latter. . Captain Lorimer calls a ttention to the excellent work done by the two officers (Lieutenants Ranking and Wilson) who came with the guard. Lieutenant Ranking was placed on special duty as Assistant to Captain Lorimer and accompanied him on tour to Ispahan, Kermanshah and Pusht-i-Kuh. Lieutenant Wilson in the meanwhile made excellent use of his opportunities while in charge of his guard to make surveys of the Bakhtiari lowlands, part of the Kuhgalu country, and a good deal of the coast. The information which Lieutenant Wilson has collected will be most useful to the Survey of India and to the Intelligence Branch, end his zeal is most commendable. • tt ' ^ fter leavin g Ispahan, Captain Lorimer made a valuable tour toTusht- i-Kuh regarding which a special report has been submitted. Captain Lorimer gives some particulars about foreign enterprise in Arabistan. It is undoubtedly advisable that the Imperial Bank of Persia should estabhsh itself in Arabistan without delay. It is difficult to say definitely e - most efficacious arrangement would be, but offices at Mohammerah Dizful 111 WOllld P robabl y be required with sub-agencies at Shushter and ■p /f ver y satisfactory to record that the question of the taking over ot the Ahwaz-Borasjun line by the Telegraph Department materialized after the end. ot the year, and Mr. Smith, Assistant Superintendent, Shiraz, was deputed m March 1909 to reconstruct the line. .^ rin P olic y pursued by Captain Lorimer in his dealings with the Bakhtiaris and the unfailing support accorded thereto by His •xl eS t y s Legation, the end of the year under report finds our relations with the Khans on a much more satisfactory footing. The condition of Bunder Abbas was somewhat unsettled, and robberies Bunder ma raids m the hinterland were frequent, during the period under review. Abba9 - The year opened with the so-called Constitutional regime, which in Bunder Abbas was represented by a local council of busy-bodies who would a i la wn o matter to progress without their interference. The disappearance 0 this Anjuman-i-Jamid ' in July after the Shah's coup ftetat was received with unmixed pleasure by the respectable inhabitants of the town. Lieutenant Gabriel went on 3J months' privilege leave in May and shortly after his return was invalided to India. Captain W. H. I. Shakespear returned to Bunder Abbas on the 25th November and was in charge till the end of the year. Kerman affairs do not call for much comment. The province was in Kerman. a state of anarchy at the beginning of the year, but after the Shah's coup y a semblance of or(ier was restored by Sahib Ikhtiyar who was named Governor. The Nationalist party do not appear to have made much nead.-way in Kerman. The Bunder Abbas-Kerman caravan routes have been chronically impas sable or unsafe throughout the year. Posts have only been getting through at rare intervals and parcels and stores for the Consulate and other Europeans dSjomfcTt^ 01 * m0nt ^ S -^ un( ^ er Abbas to their great inconvenience and un d er review is chiefly remarkable at Kermanshah as at Kermanshao. Government 068 m ^ &gt;ers ^ a, ^ or non-existence of any proper form of b 2Maskat, ^ ADMINISTEATION EEPOilT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY In April, the district remained for three weeks without even a xioiyi' Governor, and after that the local tribal Chief, Zahir-ul-Mulk, was apn ^ t ed. He was a complete failure as Governor, as any local chief must f necessity be. Considerable depredations were committed by tribes fr Luristan during the period when there was no Governor, and afterward 11 throughout the rest of the year robberies and attacks on travellers be' S ' frequent. The roads round Kermanshah were less safe than they have for years. een Captain Haworth makes some interesting observations about trad openings in his district. It is to be regretted that his efforts to interest British firms have not met with a better response, but it can hardly b wondered at, for Persia has become anathema in the eyes of the commercial world. Mr. Holland (who took charge of the Consulate on November Uth) has submitted an interesting report, and it is unnecessary to comment at IpnotK on Maskat affairs. gtn The principal matters of interest are— (1) The final settlement of the long drawn out French Flag question (2) The continued activity of the Arms Traffic. (3) The appointment of an Italian News Agent in connection with the arms traffic to Somaliland. Mr. Holland deals with these in sections X, VIII and X (c) of his report On the 3rd of June Monsieur Blanchon, the newly-appointed French Consul, died suddenly of heat-stroke. He had hardly been in Maskat a month. His Highness's territories were on the whole comparatively tranquil; but, as usual, desultory hostilities between various tribes occurred from time to time. His Highness has erected a telephone from Maskat to Matrah and Sib, which is proving very useful. Mekran coast. The Mekran Coast (like the rest of Persia) has been very unsettled during the year. The principal interest in this Coast is of course the arms traffic. This continued unabated throughout the year. The incident of the capture of the dhow by the Proserpine on April 24th, 1908, and the subsequent posting of a guard at Jask was dealt with in last year's report. After this capture a considerable number of rifles was thrown overboard by dhows on sighting men-of-war and the arms traffic thus received a decided check towards the end of 1907-08 season, which closed about the end of May 1908. The nakhoda and crew of the boats seized by the Proserpine were taken to Bushire by the flagship and there handed over to the Governor who imprisoned them. After a short imprisonment the crew were bastinadoed and released, but the nakhoda, Hassan Tashi, was kept in confinement till October when during the interregnum between the Derya Begi's departure and the Moazziz-ed-Dowleh's arrival he effected his escape, probably By bribing the officials. Before the commencement of the season 1908-09, the opinion was ex pressed to the Government of India by the Honourable the Agent to the Governor-General, Quetta, and by the JResident that the measures hitherto pursued had had no tangible result and had simply had the effect of annoying the Amir and his subjects without placing any serious check on the trade. It was pointed out that measures on the present scale were futile, but that the Coast could be blockaded either by land or sea if Government were pre pared to face the expense. Owing, however, to the fact that the result erf the Brussels Arms Conference might improve the outlook. His Majesty's Govern ment felt unable to consider more extensive measures and decided that for the season we must continue to do our best with the means hitherto employed. Mr. New was authorised to continue his system of watchmen on the line and\^J AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1908. was in addition granted a guard of 30 Mekran Levy sepoys as a precaution against reprisals by the Afghans. Mr. New's system of intelligence was very good, as m previous years, but up to the end of the year it was not found possible to keep more than one ship on the coast, and no results were achieved before the end of the year. It is satisfactory to mention, however that two very successful captures of 1,300 rifles and 181,000 rounds of ammunition were made by H.M.S. Fox (Captain A. Hunt) in March, and after that a lot were thrown overboard by dhows on sighting His Maiestv's ships so that the trade received a salutary if temporary set-back. The success of the method, namely, that of boat-cruising which H.M.S. Fox's larger complement of blue jackets enabled her to employ, indicates the lines on which measures for an effective blockade of the coast are likelv to be devised. ^ Bahrein has been quiet throughout the period under review. The only Bahrein thing worthy of note is the return of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed on precise precautionary conditions after three years' detention in India. Sheikh Ali has been given the enjoyment of such property as he possessed, outside Manama and an allowance of R300 per mensem and is at present conducting himself in a satisfactory manner. • con( ^^ on ^ the pearl market this season, many merchants m Bahrein are on the verge of bankruptcy and trade is stagnant. On the mainland, the last nine months have been a period of considerable stress. The Mutassariflik of El Hasa was constantly in a disturbed con dition while the district of Katif was even worse. Affairs in Katif culminated in July in an attack on the town and the oasis by Bedouin which resulted in much loss of life and damage to property. Order was not restored until reinforcements arrived from Basrah on 28th August. The activity of His Majesty's ships undoubtedly prevented the Bedouin from extending their depredations to sea and thus inflicting great damage to the trade of Bahrein. The Political Agent calls attention to the fact that the new regime in Turkey has begun by strengthening the garrisons in Hasa and Katif, and points out that there are indications that a more active policy with regard to Katar will be inaugurated. In this connection it was unfortunate that in the absence of the Political A.gent from Bahrein the representatives of the Al-bu-Ainain should have invited the authorities at Basrah to intervene in their disputes with Sheikh Jasim, and thus have given the Turkish Govern ment a pretext for activity in Katar. During the five years that Major Prideaux has represented Govern ment in Bahrein, there has been a gradual improvement in the position of our Agency there and enhancement of British influence, and it is a matter for regret that after several years of steady and useful work, the time has come for that officer to ask for a well-earned furlough. The period under review has, on the whole, been uneventful in Koweit. Koweit. The town and district have been kept in good order under the powerful rule of Sheikh Mubarak. The Sheikh's relations with the Political Agent were most cordial at the end of the year, after a period in the hot weather during which they were somewhat strained by the ' Waroonga ' incident and the quarantine difficulty. These two questions and that concerning the Sheikh's Fao properties have been the principal matters of interest during the year. In regard to the last mentioned, the Sheikh's constant complaints against the Turks have given rise to a good deal of correspondence and the Political Agent visited Basrah in July to confer with His Majesty's Consul there en the subject. The question, however, appears to have been temporarily settled by the Sheikh with the local authorities, and the fact that he has bought the large property known as 'Fadhagieh' seems to show that the Sheikh does not anticipate much further trouble. This new acquisition of the Sheikh's is an island property on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab adjoining his ' Dawasir ' property.0 ADMINISTRATION EEPURT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Unless unforeseen circumstances combine to make the matter more press ing, it would seem that the simplest solution of the quarantine difficulty will be the suspension of the f ast mail service to Koweit, the post being served by the fortnightly slow mail, and in the alternate week the new Agency steam launch Lewis Pelly being utilised to meet the fast mail at Fao and take over the Koweit post. Major Knox, who vacated the post of First Assistant at Bushire to ini tiate the Koweit Agency in August 1904, has now applied for long furlough to Europe. The personality of the Sheikh makes the work of this post of a difficult and delicate type and Major Knox deserves much credit for the patience and success with which he has filled it. P. Z. CDX, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,CHAPTER I. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR BUSHIRE AND THE PERSIAN COAST FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING 31ST DECEMBER 1908. ia) Governor. —His Excellency the Derya Begi was Governor from the Bushire, beginning of the year, till October when he was replaced by Moazziz-ed- PeSf 111 Dowleh, brother of Asaf-ed-Dowleh, the new incapable Governor-General officials, of Shiraz. The former is quite as inefficient as the latter, and since he has been at Bushire he has not made the least attempt to govern. In fact in November, a month after his arrival, he left for Charbar where he remained till the end of the year. In spite of the absence of the Governor, however, Bushire remained tranquil. Settlement of commercial and other cases was, however, naturally somewhat difficult in the absence of any executive. {h) Karguzar. —At the beginning of the year, Mavakker-ed-Dowleh nominally held the post of Karguzar. He however remained absent at Shiraz, his brother Masud-es-Sultaneh acting for him. The latter left for Europe in June and his successor Itila-ed-Dowleh had not arrived by the end of the year. (c) Cvstoms. —There were several changes in the personnel of the Customs Department. At the beginning of the year, M. Leleux arrived as Inspector-General. He, however, decided to make his head-quarters at Mohammerah, and M. Constant, who had been acting Director, became Director ad interim till May when he went on leave; after a short time, during which M. Zwinne acted, M. Stas arrived from Mohammerah and took charge. M. Stas held charge till the end of the year, but just after the close of it handed over to M. Zwinne who is now de facto Director- Monsieur Miller, who had been acting Russian Consul-General for more Foreign than two years, left for Europe on furlough in November 1908, being re- Coii8ul3 - placed by Monsieur Kadloubowsky who had previously been a student inter preter at Resht. Dr. J. A. Bussiere, doctor to the French and Russian Consulates and in medical charge of the Customs Department, left on furlough after five years' service in Bushire. He is not expected to return. His prospective successor. Dr. Combier, had not arrived at the end of the year. In spite of the disturbed state of the country, the imports during the Commerce, nine months under review, owing no doubt to the arrival of goods ordered a long time back, remained almost normal. The settlement of commercial cases has been getting increasingly difficult and bankruptcies, fraudulent and otherwise, are of frequent occurrence as the result of the present admims- etrative chaos. In fact it is seldom safe to press a creditor as he at once declares himself bankrupt. ( cl ) Russian Line. —This Company has not been doing. much business, foreign There have been constant reports that its service to the Gulf is shortly to be compeubon. suspended; considering the amount of business done it is a wonder that this course was not adopted long ago. It is understood, however, that under its contract with the Russian Government it has to continue its sailings for 18 months longer. (h) German Trade. —The Hamburg Amerika Line has persevered actively throughout the year with its sailings to the Gulf, the approximate value of imports and exports during the second year of its operations here (September 1907 to September 1908) being £57,509 as compared with £60,794 for the first year. It seems however that the Company must be working at a loss as Herr Ballin, the Managing Director, has recently approached the various British Lines with a view ^o the formation of a combination. Thisg ADMINISTBATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY overture has so far failed, but at the end of the year Herr Ballin had apparently given up all hope of effecting it. no ' 1 i {c) Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. —The activities of this firm, who a agents of the Hamburg Amerika Line at all the ports of steamer call in th 6 Persian Gulf, have been chiefly confined to Mr. Brown, the Manager at Lm 6 gah. This gentleman resents the attempts of Messrs, Gray Paul &amp; Co t' compete at Lingah and more than one acrimonious dispute has arisen between him and Messrs. Gray Paul's representative. oxide. {a) Alu husa. —In April last, with the approval of His Majesty's Gov ernment, Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. removed 1,810 tons in the S.S. Louise It has been decided that about 400 tons remaining on the beach and a consi derable quantity of accumulated oxide heaped at the mouth of the pit shall be considered at the disposal of the firm; but so far Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co have made no attempt to remove this; and it is reported that they have had difficulty in disposing of their last shipment above mentioned. (b) Hormuz. —In September it was rumoured that the Shah proposed to cancel the Moin-ut-Tujjar's concession for Hormuz oxide, and considerable correspondence ensued, as Messrs. Strick desired to bid for the concession if the Moin's lease were cancelled. It was believed also that the German firm was trying to obtain the concession. Finally, however, after payment of a considerable sum by the Moin, his lease was re-affirmed. After this it seems that the Moin offered impossible conditions for the sale and export of the oxide, which Messrs. Strick, who had hitherto handled it, could not accept. They eventually withdrew from negotiations and the Moin has since entered into an arrangement with another British firm, Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. for shipping the mineral. (c) Other Islands.- —Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. having thus dropped out of the Hormuz trade applied in October last to His Majesty's Government for assistance in obtaining a concession for mining on various other islands, negotiations in regard to which are still in progress. Quarantine. The German Consulate has recently assumed the role of captious critic of the quarantine regime conducted by us for the Persian Government. Con siderable correspondence took place in August, September and October 1908 between His Majesty's Legation and the German Legation in regard to a detail of the regulations owing to the representations or misrepresentations of Dr. Listemann. The question arose through Mr. Krumpeter, Manager for Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. at Bushire, visiting a Hamburg Amerika Line ship which had gone aground outside the harbour, before the Health Officer's visit. On receiving an intimation that this was contrary to rule Dr. Listemann entered into a long correspondence dragging in the long past event of the ' Savoia ', etc. {vide report for 1907-1908). The matter was of no consequence itself and Dr. Listemann was shown to be quite in the wrong; but the incident is an indication of the direction of the prevailing wind. The general health of Bushire has been good during the period under review and there have been no epidemics in the Gulf. Captain Williams, Residency and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer in the Gulf, went on three months' privilege leave in August and Captain White, Mobile Assistant, acted for him. A report on Sanitary matters by the Residency Surgeon is attached. ExceUem^ th -^ s . Excellency Commodore Sir George Warrender arrived at NavVcom- e Bushire in H.M.S.

Local Sheikhs and Khans have been at perfect liberty to pursue their sweet will in the collection of rahdari and other transit dues, and, as may be imagined, they are not slow to avail them selves of the privilege. Freights between Bushire and Shiraz have consequently ruled high during the year. Lingah has been in a disturbed condition throughout the year, the rival i^ngah. Sunni and Shian factions having been unusually hostile to one another. As mentioned in last year's report, an assembly styled the Anjuman-i- Azad was started by Ala-es-Sultan in 1907 when he was acting Director of Customs. This Assembly was actively supported by Mr. Brown (Agent of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co.) and continued to give considerable trouble until June, when it was suppressed by order of the Derya Begi. It has con tinued to keep up a precarious existence under the style of a school and will, no doubt, re-appear shortly. The Sadid-es-Sultaneh, the Russian Consular Agent, has been an active partisan of the Anjuman. In the beginning of the year. His Excellency the Derya Begi, after constant pressure from the Residency, recalled Safar Ali Khan, the Deputy Governor, who had been giving a lot of trouble and the case of the beating and robbing of the Bahreini, Ibrahim Bu Khalil, by Safar Ali Khan {vide last year's report) was satisfactorily settled. Another case, viz., the firing on the British flag by Muhammad Hassan, Chief of Kais, was also disposed of, the Derya Begi arresting and imprison ing the Chief, who was finally released in August after payment of a suitable fine. The Sadid-es-Sultaneh was Russian Consular Agent until the 8th Lingah December when he left for Bunder Abbas to take up his appointment of Con- Rep^ienta. sular Agent for Bunder Abbas and Lingah after the departure of Monsieur tives. Ovseenko on leave- About the end of March 1908, the Derya Begi paid a visit to Lingah during which he had the flagstaff erected by Khwaja Muhammad Abdulla (a troublesome Persian who called himself the Turkish Consul) removed. Haji Abdur Rahman remained French Consular Agent throughout the year but has since been removed from his post. Since the departure of the Ala-es-Sultan, the Directors of Customs at customs. Lingah have not given much trouble. One incident, however, occurred in which for a technical error a boat belonging to a Bahreini by name Ahmad bin Jasim bin Jodar was seized and sold. Some relief in the shape of the refund of 35 per cent, of the value of the vessel has been obtained by His Majesty's Legation. Owing to the inconvenience of raising the Bahrein issue acutely, it was not considered expedient to press the Persian Govern ment on the subject officially. Towards the end of the year, Lingah was much disturbed by news from Lar, where one Seyyid Abdul Hussain had started a revolt. This individual had it appeared obtained considerable success and was constantly threatening a descent on Lingah. In June 1908, it came to notice that certain native boats employed by Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. were flying the German flag apparently merely on the authority of written certificates issued by Mr. Brown. The matter was brought to the notice of Government and steps were taken to make sure that the issue of our own flag in the gulf was conducted on regular lines, before the nature of any communication to the German Government was decided upon. During the period under report, 13 slaves were granted papers of manu- Slave trade, mission at the Residency; 11 of these were from Shargah, 1 from Lingah and 1 from Bushire.

The history of the period falls naturally into three parts, which may be General, entitled respectively, Government, Misgovernment and No-government. It opens with a short interlude of peace and order under H. I. H. Zil-es-Sultan followed by over two months of active misgovernment by the Sardar Firuz; and for the remainder of the year all government gradually dissolved in the incapable hands of Asaf-ed-Dowleh. Peace reigned in Shiraz itself through out the nine months under report, for reasons which will be discussed under the heading 'Local Politics' but the state of the rest of the province is clearly indicated by the epidemic of road robberies, which reached its highest point during the autumn migration of the tribes. The appointment of His Imperial Highness Zil-es-fSultan had already Local been notified in March, but he did not actually arrive until May 8th. The authorities - terror of his name had, however, gone before him, and complete order reigned on the principal trade routes during April, though the outskirts of the city continued disturbed until his arrival. He was dismissed after the Shah's coup d'etat, apparently as the result of the compromising proceedings of his adherents in Tehran, and left on July 6th. It must be admitted that he never imposed any effective control upon the more remote and contumacious tribes, such as the Kuhgalu and Lashani, and also that the confident expectations of progress with the settlement of British claims which were founded on his advent were destined to be disappointed; but it must be remembered that he found the province in a state of complete disorganisation, and that his personal presence in Shiraz lasted for two months only. During that period the city was under complete control, and the province for the most part quiet, while the commerce of Ears has to thank Zil-es-Sultan for four months of comparatively safe circulation, during which period a large quantity of goods were brought forward. 'It is to be feared that it will be long before another such opportunity occurs. Asaf-ed-Dowleh. —Appointed on the departure of Zil-es-Sultan, arrived at Shiraz on September 21st; still in office at the end of the year. This official was, unfortunately, no stranger to this post, in which he had displayed his natural incapacity in 1902. The news of his appointment was received with derision, his arrival regarded with apathy, and his orders treated with con tempt. He is religious and asthmatic; personally polite, with some verbal in genuity in argument, and great readiness in professions of friendship; is commonly in his anderun, especially when prompt action is required and is m general equally obstinate and ineffective. Karguzar. —Muazed -ed-Dowleh held this post throughout the period. He is personally friendly, and always ready to assist in petty matters, not beyond suspicion of venality, and very loath to take^ action liable to compro mise him with any important person or class. This is perhaps not unnatural under the circumstances, as he could look for no support from the (jovernor- General. He is noteworthy for keeping his correspondence m better order than most Persian officials. Deputy-Governor. —Under Zil-es-Sultan—Mushir-ul-Mulk. A hard working and hard-worked official, but a mere instrument m the hands ot his maS ^ er Under Asaf-ed -Dowleh—Sardar-Eiruz. This person is a fellow tribes man and relative of Asaf-ed-Dowleh, who sent him to Shiraz m advance to manage the province until his own arrival. He arrived on July 16th and continued to administer affairs with a single eye to his own profit until the arrival of Asaf-ed-Dowleh. He is a drunken boor. Beqlerhegi.—This post was held throughout the period, by Ata-ed-Dow- leh of the well known Nuri family, who was also in sole charge during the short interregnum between the departure of Zil-es-Sultan and the arrival of pardar Eiruz.24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GUEF POLITICAL RESIDENCY He is a person of no manners or cultivation, has made a good d money in this office, and has very indifferent control over his subord t 0 ^ who appear to be responsible for the more outrageous acts of tyranny ^ mitted in his name; but he has a certain reputation for severity and 0111 ' sequently a certain measure of control over the disreputable element 00 ^ the population. s Local politics. Zil-es-Sultan was appointed during the anxious days which followed th murder of Qavam-ul-Mulk, the attempt on his elder son, and the consecm t killing of two Seyyids and arrest of Motamid-ud-Divan. Matters remain^ in status quo until his arrival, although the Mujtehids of Nejef endeavour^ to provoke a breach of the peace by sending and causing to be placarded the door of the principal mosque in Shiraz furious telegrams addressed to f 011 Assembly and the Anjumans, demanding the blood of all concerned in tlf killing of the Seyyids. Zil-es-Sultan lost no time in declaring his symoa- thies; he complimented several of the local Anjumans, entrusted to the local Assembly or ' Majlis-i-Ayalati' the investigation of the murder of the two Seyyids, and facilitated, if he did not order, the early departure of the Kavam's two sons for Europe. The Shiraz populace, always ready to be ' plus royaliste que le roi ' threw themselves into the anti-Qavami movement, and a strong agitation was set on foot to procure the arrest of the brothers at Bushire, and their trial for the murder of the Seyyids. Zil-es- Sultan, however, averted this, and satisfied public feeling by the execution of two of the principal roughs of the Qavami section. The control of the Arab tribes (Ainallu, Arab, Baharlu, Basari and Nafar), with the Deputy-Gover norships of Lar and Saba, was entrusted by Zil-es-Sultan to his son Akbar Mirza, the collapse of the Qavami authority being emphasised by the ap pointment of Motamid-ud-Divan to be the latter's Peshkar. At the end of May, therefore, the situation seemed both clear and promising; the Zil-es- Sultan had proclaimed himself ' the only spontaneously Constitutional Prince in history ', the ground was cleared by the departure of the Qavamis, the town was in good order, the towers built during the disorders had been pulled down, a flock of Deputy-Governors and special Mamours had set out to fill posts vacant in most cases by the expulsion or voluntary flight of the previous incumbent, and to enquire into specific cases of robbery and disorder, and all prospects for the future were as radiant as can be expected in Persia of the present day. This happy state of affairs lasted for most of the month of June, the principal pre-occupation in the political sphere being the conflict between the Shah and the Parliament. The real facts of the activity of Zil-es-Sultan in this connection were of course not ascertainable at Shiraz, but as far as was apparent locally he was anxious to maintain his character for sympathy with the popular movement without compromising himself hopelessly with the Shah. He went so far, however, as to hold a review of his troops with as much pomp^ and dignity as possible, and there can be little doubt that his object in this was to intimidate the Court party. At the end of this month the stormy petrel of Shiraz politics, Motamid-ud-Divan, was treacherously murdered by Asghar Khan, Arab, in spite of the presence at his back of 800 men and two guns. It would have been interesting to observe the effect of this event on the prestige, hitherto unshaken, of Zil-es-Sultan, but un fortunately it was followed closely by the dismissal of the latter, who left Shira? on July 6th. ^ Aivhuugh the name of the new Governor-General excited nothing but derision, the natural inertia of the Shiraz populace, when unstimulated by cash payments, was sufficient to keep the town quiet until the arrival of his lieutenant, Sardar Firuz, on July 16th. This inaugurated a period of dis order in Pars, and of open tyranny and corruption in Shiraz. The first refugees appeared at the Consulate within a week of the Sardar's arrival, and the Consulate was not free of them for the remainder of the year. The most notable of these were :— (1) Khabir-ed-Dowleh, late Director of Persian Telegraphs, and in temporary charge of Pars after the departure of Nizam-eS'AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1908. 15 Sultaneh in November 1908. He had been summoned peremptorily to Tehran, and on excusing himself, was despatch- ed under arrest, but contrived to escape. (2) Mirza Qasim Khan, brother of the late Motamid-ud -Divan who was Governor of Kazerun at the time of his brothers murder. He escaped under somewhat dramatic circumstances from a body of horsemen who, as he believed, had orders to put mm to death. r (3) Prince Hani-ed-Dowleh, a grandson of Path Ali Shah, who was subjected to insults by the local authorities. In all cases every- thmg possible was done to discourage the practice of taking bast ' and to induce refugees to leave as soon as possible, but the repeated acts of bad faith of which the Sardar Firuz was guilty rendered this very difficult. Relations with the latter became more and more difficult, and were ultimately broken off entirely pending a full apology by him, as a result of his publicly insulting a British Indian subject who had been sent with the Consulate Mirza to represent a case to him. The requisite apology was not obtained until the arrival of Asaf-ed-Dowleh, when the Sardar attended at the Residency by the latter's express orders, for this purpose. The arrival of Asaf-ed-Dowleh inaugurated the period of ' No-govern ment.' It coincided with the return from Europe of the Qavami brothers, and everything pointed to an era of government by the latter through tho titular Governor-General. This would probably have followed, had any revenue been coming in, but the Qavamis soon found that they were expected to finance all operations of Government, besides reducing to order the more recalcitrant portions of the province. Thus they were directed by the Shah to send a force of Arab horsemen to Tehran, His Majesty proposing to pay about half the amount per man which is ordinarily paid by the Qavam in Shiraz, the balance to be found by the Qavamis; the arrears of pay demanded by a number of men of the Buzchallu Regiment, in bast at the Consulate were also defrayed by them; while Nasr-ed-Dowleh was entrusted with the task of restoring order among the Arabs, and Salar-es-Sultan moved in the direction of Darab and Lar, where he was expected to reduce to submission Seyyid Abdul Hussain Lari, who had raised the standard of revolt against the Shah. These operations provided the principal preoccupation in public affairs during the rest of the year. The continual disorder of the trade routes caused great discontent in mercantile circles, and several attempts were made to get up a vigorous agitation against the Governor, but fortunately the Shirazis are only ready to join in an agitation when they are paid for it; in fact their apathy under present circumstances shews clearly enough that all previous agitations were conducted on a cash basis. The complete absence of any expression of popular indignation or regret at the disappearance of the Majlis was a striking feature of Shiraz politics. Immediately after the cowp d'etat a small knot of Mullahs attempted to get up a movement, which collapsed instantly on receiving a sharp snub from Zil- es-Sultan. The Sardar Firuz, in spite of the Imperial proclamation of amnesty, carried out a small proscription on his own account of persons known to have been prominent in this Parliamentary cause, but even the obvious weakness of Asaf-ed-Dowleh was productive of nothing but an agitation in favour of the appointment of a strong Governor of whatever party or opinions. In fact all the evidence points to the conclusion that the Constitutional agita tion was never a genuine movement in Shiraz, but was merely a rallying-cry for the various sections who were united only in their animosity to the power of the Qavam. For this reason, and also, doubtless, on account of the general desire for peace after the continual disturbances of 1907, the removal succes sively of Qavam-ul-Mulk and his principal opponent sufficed to ensure peace in Shiraz until the close of the year. As far as the Constitutional agitation can be said to have continued at all, it was transferred to the district of Lar by the flight thither of Seyyid20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Abdul Hussain, which took place on July 11th. He was pursued by a party of horsemen who, probably intentionally, failed to overtake him. He was not again heard of until the beginning of October, when he was reported to have gathered a force and proclaimed, following the Mujtehids of Nejef, that the service of Muhammad Ali Shah was the service of Yezid, and consequently it was sinful to pay revenue. This article of religion of course found eager adherents, and it soon became necessary for Qavam-ul-Mulk in person to move against the Seyyid. He delayed however until November 21st, by which time the movement had become formidable, and he found himself unable to proceed beyond Darab. In fact a force of Arabs under AsgKar Khan {vide infra) when proceeding to join him was somewhat severely defeated. The position at the close of the year was that Seyyid Abdul Hussain was maintaining him self in Lar, the Qavami brothers negotiating unsuccessfully at Darab, and ruining themselves by maintaining a large mounted force in a district where the last year's crop had completely failed, and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh was watching the situation from his winter quarters near Jahrum. The natural disinclination of a Persian force to risk a fight was aggravated for the Qavamis by fear of compromising themselves hopelessly with the Constitu tionalists in the existing indeterminate political conditions of Persia. Kashqais —The internal politics of the Kashgais were unusually peace ful Soulet-ed-Dowleh remained Ilkhani throughout the period, m spite of the continual intrigues of his brother, the Zeigham-ed-Dowleh, and was very careful to avoid identifying himself actively with either party m the State. In the autumn of 1907 his hostility to the Qavam had led him to identify himself openly with the popular party; on the arrival of Asat-ed-Dowleh he shewed himself eager to efface this impression by furnishing a guard for his person and personally escorting him for several marches, and later by shew ing activity in the collection of revenue. These exertions were rewarded by the title of Sardar-i-Ashaigh. His supremacy m the tribe was only once threatened, when his brother secured the support of the strong Shishbuluki section, in October, and hostilities on the usual battle ground of the tribe, the Beyza 'district, appeared imminent. They were, however, averted and the Zeiffham was forced to take refuge with Nasr-ed-Dowleh. The Kashgais had an exceedingly good year in the tribal industry of highway robbery, although most of their exploits were performed outside the limits o± *ars. The leading Parsi banker of Shiraz, after a visit to Soulet-ed-Dowleh, stated that he had seen stolen goods which had been brought from Khorasan, and even from Ashkabad. Nonetheless, when desirous of conciliating the local authorities, Soulet- ed-Dowleh went so far as to put two robbers to death, and cut oh the hands and feet of seven others. He seems, however, to be a man of cautious charac ter, and though feared by his tribe, is neither beloved nor greatly respected. There can be little doubt that since the weakening of the Qavami power by the abortive operations against the Lari Seyyid described already, there is no force in the province capable of resisting the united strength of the Kashgai. Arabs.—As already related, after the departure of the Qavami brothers, the Arabs were handed over by Zil-es-Sultan to the tender mercies o eir Ute noir, Motamid-ud-Divan. This appointment had been made once betore in the summer of 1907, and was then rescinded on all the headmen taking ' bast ' in the telegraph office at Dehbid. Consequently the MoUmia under no illusions as to the feelings of the Arabs towards him. ^ He spent month in trying to conciliate them, and did in fact induce a majon y o headmen to appear at Zil-es-Sultan's review {vide ante page 14). His n proceeding was to move out with a force of 800 men to collect reve overawe the malcontents. He had also promised most solemnly to reco ^ a the British claims relating to the Ispahan road. He received many warn * before he set out, and was generally believed to be aware of the fac . . leader of the malcontents, Asghar Khan, had sworn on the Koran ^ ™ , in revenge for the Qavam. He was, however, a man of most unusual p. courage, which was doubtless the reason of the ascendancy w ^ ^ obtained in Pars, and he went out determined to , 1 dlstin ^ ls ^ Q ^f Kba n suppressing the Arabs. He was received in a friendly way by gAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 17 with a large party of his own section, and was shot dead from behind by Asghar Khan's brother, as the party was approaching the village of Saidan on the Ispahan road. This event, followed by the dismissal of Zil-es-Sultan, made Asghar Khan a great man, and he gave himself up to a course of continual depredation on the Ispahan road, maintaining himself entirely on the crops of the settled population. His reputation rose so high that he was at one time known generally in the north of Fars as Asghar Shah,. He received a telegram of thanks from the Shah for removing Motamid-ud- Divan, and for the same reason became the cherished friend of the Qavamis. The other Arab sections, though not enjoying the same privileged posi tion, still contrived to combine a maximum of robbery with a minimum of # revenue. The concluding months of the year were spent by the whole tribe in assisting Qavam-ui-Mulk and Nasr-ed-Dowleh, in a somewhat spasmodic fashion, in their abortive operations against the Lari Seyyid. Kuhgelu.-^ThQ Boir Ahmadi section of this tribe, in proportion to their numbers, were more conspicuous than any other for the number and extent of their depredations. They completely closed the Ispahan road between Yez- dikhast and Shulgistan for about ten days in the autumn, and Behbehan, the market chiefly frequented by them, was reported to be glutted with European goods of all kinds, obtainable below cost price. The principal features of the year were a good average crop of opium commerce, commanding a good price, a congestion of imports owing to the insecurity of all trade routes, which paralysed the circulation of goods from Shiraz to the districts, and an increasing shortage of cash owing to the extensive ravages of the nomads, which left the people nothing to selL In this connec tion the outlook for 1909 was exceedingly unfavourable. In connection with non-British trade the only incident worthy of note is the arrival of Dr. Pugin in September. This gentleman was endeavouring to introduce German alizarine dyes, but was not apparently very successful, as, although their colours are fast, they require more care in manipulation than the extensively smuggled anilines. The grain crops above Kazerun were good when they were allowed to Agriculture, stand by the nomads, but they were very extensively destroyed by the latter. In the maritime plain the crop was a complete failure. The opium crop was a failure in the Shiraz plain and about average elsewhere. This subject may be summed up in very few words;—with Zil-es-Sultan, Publiccecu- security was practically complete; without him, non-existent. The Bushirc by road was never actually closed to traffic, but robberies, especially during the autumn migration of the Kashgai, were very frequent. The town of Kazerun relapsed into its usual anarchy on Zil-es-Sultan's dismissal, and internecine feuds were vigorously carried on until the appointment of Haji Muhammad Karim Khan, a Kashgai chief, at the end of September. On November 9th the man who more than anyone else had been responsible for the perpetual disturbances in this town, Khwaja Ibrahim, met his natural end by treacherous murder. Fighting between Haidar Khan of Kamarij and his enemy the Khan of Daliki, suspended during Zil-es-Sultan's stay, was joy fully resumed on the latter's departure, and the plain of Konartakhteh was the scene of intermittent hostilities for the rest of the year. The Ispahan road was actually closed for some ten days in the autumn by the Boir Ahmadi tribe, a party of whom succeeded in killing the only headman on the entire road who had shown any capacity to resist the nomads. The post was robbed seven times on the Ispahan road, and four times on the Bushire road, two postmen being murdered. The largest of many robberies of British goods were—three cases opium, value tomans 1,500 taken by Arabs; indigo, value tomans 1,360 stolen by Fars tribesmen in Kerman province ; and 40 bales of piece goods valued at tomans 3,049, the property of Messrs Dixon, taken by Boir Ahmadi near Shulgistan. This unfortunate firm has lost no less than tomans 3,760 or about £750 in this period alone. But such direct losses are the least of the extra charges in flicted on British trade by a state of disorder such as that now prevailing in !

The road guards became absolutely beyond control, and as a result rates of mule hire rose to unprecedented heights, as shown in the annp 5 table for the Bushire road. * xe(i Church This institution enjoyed comparative peace throughout the period n socTety ar ^ difficulty over Mr. Clifton's house, referred to in the last annual report con tinned, but eventually he left it with flying colours and a solatium of tW months' rent in cash and a donation of tomans 25 to the school. A small attempt at persecution was made in November under the auspices of a leadino Mullah but it never received any popular support and was soon dropped. It was apparently instigated by the notorious Italian Jew and Moslem convert Veneziani, who had recently returned to Shiraz and was desirous of opening a rival institution. slaves. No letters of manumission were granted during the period. The five slaves mentioned in last year's report were eventually induced to return to their masters on the latters' assurances of good treatment. One female slave was in the Consulate awaiting manumission at the close of the year. Travellers, These were not very numerous; Mr. E. E. Holland and Captain Bird-- etc. ' wood of the Political Department, with Lieutenant Meade, I. A., stayed some days in Shiraz at the end of April, and accompanied Mr. Grahame to Ispahan by the unfrequented Sarhad route; Mme. la Comtesse de Clermont-Tonnerre, accompanied by M. Pierri, a Corfiote, arrived early in August after a very hazardous and trying journey from Ahwaz via Behbehan and remained about two months. Mr. J. C. Pearson, of the Carnegie Institute, Washing ton, who is engaged on a magnetic survey, stayed four days at Shiraz in Nov ember; and Captain Anginieur of the French Army passed through on the way to Bushire in the same month. Tour. His Majesty's Acting Consul undertook a short tour in the summer, pro ceeding by the ordinary road to Dehbid and diverging on the return journey to visit the Baunat valley. He had an opportunity of making the acquaint ance of all the leading Arab chiefs including the redoubtable Asgbar Khan, and of verifying the reports of widespread disorder. Mansur-es-Sultaneh, who was then in charge of the Arabs, and Haji Muhammad Ali Khan, Governor of Baunat, were most cordial and hospitable. Bia Majesty's Mr. G. Grahame left on promotion as Consul-General, Ispahan, on April 29th. Mr. J. H. Bill, I.C.S., was in charge as Acting Consul for the remainder of the year. J. H.

The present Report deals with the period 1st April to 31st December 1. Charge. —Charge was held throughout the year by Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, I.A., but before its conclusion it had been informally announced that sanction was accorded to Captain Lorimer's proceeding on long leave, and that he should make over charge to Lieutenant J. G. L. Ranking, LA. 2. Raising of the status of Vice-Consulate. —Owing to the appointment by the Netherlands Government of Mr. Gratama to act as their representa tive at Ahwaz with the honorary rank of Consul, it was found necessary to raise the status of His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consulate to that of a Con sulate. Accordingly His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs intimated to Captain Lorimer, under date 1st May 1908, that he had been ap pointed His Majesty's Consul for Arabistan. The title, however, duplicates that held by His Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah, and there is reason to believe the intention was to confer the local rank of Consul at Ahwaz. 3. The Head Clerk. —Mr. Ahmad Khan, who has been Head Clerk in the Vice-Consulate since the autumn of 1904, has applied for transfer to India, and, Government having accorded its sanction, he will shortly quit this post on being relieved. 4. The Indian Oil Guard. —This Guard has been retained at Maidan Munaftun since January last. In August the , question of the necessity for its retention during the year 1909 came under consideration. His Majesty's Consul was of opinion that it would be inexpedient to remove it as it appeared to have effected the purpose, and no radical change having taken place in the situation, there was no guarantee that its removal would not be followed by a recrudescence of the trouble experienced in 1907. In November notification was received that Mr. D'Arcy had expressed the opinion that its retention was unnecessary, but it has since been ascer tained that this view was not shared by Mr. Bradshaw, then in local charge, nor now is by Mr. Reynolds, who has again replaced him. Before leaving London Mr. Reynolds was informed by his Principals that the Foreign Office had assured Mr. D'Arcy that the Guard would not be retained during next hot weather, but no notice of a final decision has reached His Majesty's Consul. 5. Lieutenant Ranking. —Of the two Officers in charge of ihe Guard, Lieutenant Ranking was attached to His Britannic Majesty's Consul from the beginning of June for a period of five months, the intention being to enable the latter to exercise greater freedom of action. Starting in May he accompanied the Consul to Dizful, and thence via Bazuft to Ispahan, Unfortunately, owing to Captain Lorimer falling a victim to neuralgia, it was impossible to take full advantage of the arrange ment, but had it not been made this little used route via Bazuft would not have been attempted. 6. On arrival at Ispahan it was found that the Indian escort attached to the Consulate-General there in the absence of the Consul-General had got out of hand. On Captain Lorimer's suggestion the charge of the guard was made over to Lieutenant Ranking. The necessity of this move was soon proved by the development of a mutinous spirit in the guard, which even tually led to orders being issued for its withdrawal to India. The escortAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 21 left Ispahan on October 11th under the command of Lieutenant Banking who subsequently returned with the relieving guard whom he installed at Ispahan. Thereafter he rejoined the Consul who had in the meantime pro ceeded to Kermanshah en route to Pusht-i-Kuh and Arabistan. 7. The conduct of the Ispahan guard was such as to demand constant supervision and considerable firmness, and Lieutenant Ranking met these demands with a high degree of active conscientiousness and conspicuous good judgment. He also gave valuable assistance in many ways in the legiti mate work of the Consulate. On return to Arabistan he was summoned to give evidence in the Court Martial of the Ispahan guard and left Ahwaz on December 30th. 8. Lieutenant TFfem—During Lieutenant Banking's absence Lieut enant Wilson, I.A., remained in sole charge of the Oil Guard. » comn iand the guard has been maintained in an excellent state of discipline and efficiency, and no fracas or disturbances of any kind have fallen to be reported. 9. In addition to looking after the guard. Lieutenant Wilson found opportunities of continuing the excellent geographical and gazetteer work which he began in the spring. Besides completing our geographical know ledge of the Bakhtiari Garmsir to the east of the Karun, he was able to visit Susa and to explore part of the Mungasht range. Later he examined the coast from Deh Mulla to M'ashur whence he pro ceeded onwards to Mohammerah by way of Buziya, This journey was per formed while it was still the hot weather, and from that point of view probably constitutes a record since the days of Layard. Subsequently he directed his investivations to the Kuhgelu country and in reaching Dishmuq touched ground probably not previously visited by any European. He made the acquaintance of certain of the Bahmai chiefs and found them well disposed. The journey was not without those exciting incidents which are to be looked for when travelling among Lurs. 10. Lieutenant Wilson's activities for the vear terminated with a jour- ney up the direct route from Ahwaz to Dizful (between the Diz and Kerkha rivers), which it was important should be examined in view of the possible ex tension of the Oil Syndicate's operations to Pusht-i-Kuh. A fortunate chance presented itself of travelling under the protection of Sheikh Haidar of the A1 Kathir, and was promptly seized. Lieutenant Wilson's researches in the Bakhtiari country will eventually be embodied in a convenient form, in a work which is now being printed for him under the orders of the Intelligence Branch. In particular the Survey of India will have reason to be grateful for the correction of many time- honoured mistakes in their maps of the district. 11. His Britannic Majesty's Consul has great pleasure in bringing the excellent services of these two Officers to the notice of Government. 12. Dispensary. —As the Hospital Assistant accompanied the Consul on tour, the dispensary was closed from 6th May to 17th December. The clos ing of the dispensary elicited for the first time an expression of obligation on the part of the inhabitants of Nasiri for its services. On learning that its temporary closing was contemplated, the community deputed some of their leading members to beg that the Hospital Assistant should be left in Nasiri and painted in gloomy colours the fate which would otherwise befall them. ^Providence, however, does not appear to have combined with opportunity to rid the community of any of its principal lights, 13. The average attendance at the dispensary for the period during which it was open was 93-2 per day as against 42-3 for the preceding year and 42.25 for 1905-06. This increase is due to a greater suitability for the post of the new Hos pital Assistant, Fazl Elahi, who succeeded the first incumbent in December 1907.22 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The general claaracter of the medical work which presents itself remain as in previous years. 14. New Consulate building. —No information has been received to show that the question of the building of a house for the Consulate has reached a more advanced stage. Only the architects' plans were received for criticism in the month of August. 15. Consular tours, etc. —Of the nine months under review 53 days (in cluding the whole of April) were spent at head-quarters, and the remainder' 208 days, on tour. The longest continuous period spent by the Consul at one place was 55 days passed in Julfa. These facts and the defective means of communication with head -quar ters will indicate that some difficulty is experienced in dealing with routine work. The following account of tours undertaken will incidentally show the ground which has been covered during the year :— 16. 7tli May to 30th June—from Ahwaz to Isfahan. —It was at first pro posed to travel up to Ispahan via Pusht-i-Kuh, and accordingly the first move was to Dizful. The unruly state of the Sagwand, however, was found to make it impossible to reach the Wall's border, and after some delay a fresh start was made with the design of reaching Ispahan via Bazuft. This de sign was carried out. The road, formerly kept in some state of repair, was found very bad in parts, and considerable trouble was experienced from the thieving propensities of the local Bakhtiari tribes. The principal points visited were Tang-i-Baba Ahmad, Bazuft, Gardan- i-Cherri, Surab (Karkunun) and Chadegun in Faraidan. Thence Ispahan was made by way of Binn, Samum, Qala Agha, Qala Eiza, and Qadarjan. Much exploring was prevented, as has already been noted, by Captain Lorimer's suffering from persistent neuralgia. 17. 10th July to IJt-th August—Isfahan to Tehran and hack. —Per mission having been obtained. Captain Lorimer proceeded to Tehran to visit the dentist, leaving the establishment in charge of Lieutenant Ranking. Opportunity was taken to talk over various matters at the Legation, especially the question of the Luristan road. Captain Haworth (His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kermanshah), who was also at Tehran at the time, was a party in these discussions. 18. 9th October to Srd November—Isfahan to Kermanshah. —As already explained Lieutenant Ranking was detailed to march out the relieved Ispahan escort. The Consul proceeded alone by the ordinary trade route to Hamadan, passing Khonsar, Gulpaigan, Khumain, and Daulatabad. Supplies were found abundant and cheap, and the route at this season perfectly secure. From Hamadan to Kermanshah the ordinary route was followed. The road was reputed unsafe, but beyond having to make consi derable payments for useless escorts, no inconveniences were experienced. A fortnight's halt was made with His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Ker manshah owing to the delay of Lieutenant Ranking who did not arrive until the 13th November. 19. 19th November to 17th December—Kermanshah to Ahwaz via Pusht- i-Kuh. —After some difficulty owing to no escort having arrived from the Wali, resulting from the interception of a messenger of the Kermanshah Consulate by Daud Khan, Kalhor, a start was made with an escort provided by the local Governor. Leaving the journey through Pusht-i-Kuh which will be referred to later, Arabistan was entered close to Shush, and from this point, in order to avoid the Sagwand, Dizful was avoided and a straight line taken on Shuster. The journey was continued by raft down the Shatait and Karun to Wais, and thence by land to Ahwaz. 20. Northern Arabistan. —Charge of the province remained in the hands of Sheikh Khazal, but apparently more by default than by any veryAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908 23 regard 6 ^ SPring he deilied liavin g official'responsibility in A Governor eventually made his appearance in the person of Haii Saif- w?!?' ^ r 1 otil ? r t . lle Am-ud-Daulah, and grandfather of the wife of bheikh Knazal, who arrived at Nasiri on 6th November. He has spent his time since his arrival as the Sheikh's guest, and has shown not the slightest sign of life, let alone activity. 21. The course of events in Northern Arabistan during the year was in cnf ?\ nevei J t f3 1 l. The principal exception was the struggle between Sheikh Haidar of the A1 Kathir and Sheikh Farhan Assad of the Bait Sa'ad joi -i , P^ aCe was broken m April, and in the hostilities which follow ed Sheikh Haidar, with the assistance of the Sagwand Lurs, established his superiority. # It is probable that he had the support, or at least the assent, of Sheikh Khazal, who had previously forbidden him to resort to arms to avenge the constant outrages and robberies which were perpetrated on his followers by the raiding parties of Sheikh Farhan. In June Sheikh Farhan was forced to flee, and the first place he sought refuge at was *Gotwand. Thence he was induced to come and see Sheikh Khazal, and the latter allotted him land opposite Wais, but he made off to Gotwand again, and later re-established himself at Deh Nau in his former position. Again forced to flee he threw himself on the hospitality of the Beni Turuf, whom he incited to rebel against the Sheikh of Mohammerah -Eventually on the collapse of the Beni Turuf rebellion he again came in to Sheikh Khazal, and he has now with the latter's consent, come to anchor with Seyyid N'ama in the neighbourhood of Kut Nahr Hashim. No successor to him in the chieftainship of the tribe has as yet made his appearance, and he himself will find few to regret his banishment. At the end of the year Haidar's son Abbas, and Talib, son of Khurraibat, who had been held by Sheikh Khazal as hostages since the spring of 1907, were set at liberty. 22. Pending and subsequent to their intervention in the quarrel between Haidar and Farhan the Sagwand in the Dizful district behaved in their usual obstreperous manner and amused themselves with plundering the Dizfulis' crops and property. Eventually Hussain Khan was sent for by Sheikh Khazal, and some arrangement was made by which he was to receive pay in consideration for keeping up a police force, and maintaining order. This arrangement does not, how T ever, appear to have ever borne any practical fruit. -23. In December the charge of the Dizful-Shushter road was taken from Yawar Khan, Bakhtiari, to whom in recent years it has generally been en trusted, and was made over to Baqir Khan, the Shuster Kalantar, brother of the notorious Kazim Khan who was done to death by the Sardar Mukarram. The read has never been very secure, but Baqir Khan much less : capable of making it so than the man he replaces. 24. Dizful. —There have at times been the usual quarrels between the principal personages of the town which have resulted in the customary minor operations, but thev have not been of sufficient interest to merit detailed notice. The factions were represented by Asad Khan on one side and Agha Ali, Immad-ud-Daftar, on the other. Asad Khan represented the authority of Sheikh Khazal and has lately been replaced by the Nizam-ul-Ayala, who has been appointed Deputy Governor by Haji Saif-ud-Dowleh. 25. Shushter. —The Deputy-Governorship was held by Mirza Tahir Khan, Mustaufi, on behalf of the Sheikh, till relieved in December by the Mir Akhur of the new Governor by name Yadullah.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY No developments of special interest have occurred in the affairs of the town, and no more than purely domestic disturbances have occurred. The Mujtahid Abdus Samad and his relations still remain in retirement at Nejef. Sheikh Murteza of the rival house appears only to have been able to maintain a position of mediocre influence. He left Shushter in the end of October with the intention of proceeding on the Haj. 26. Sheikh Khazal has maintained his unchallenged supremacy through out the year. The principal events of political interest which fall to be noted are— the treaty arranged between the Sheikh and the Bakhtiari Khans, the renewal to the Sheikh of the assurances previously given him bv % the British Government, and the annually recurring trouble with the Beni Turuf. The first of these matters is referred to further on vide paragraph 38. 27. As regards the second, reference may be made to paragraph 43 lower down. The nature of the assurances which it was decided to gi^e to the Sheikh is indicated in the following extract from His Majesty's Minister's Despatch No. 12, dated 22nd August 1908 :— ' The wish expressed by the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhti ari Khans for nearer relations with His Majesty's Government has been most carefully considered by the Foreign and India Offices, ^and it has now been agreed that it would be un desirable at present to give the Bakhtiari Khans any assurances beyond an expression of friendly sympathy, but that in the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, the general assurances given to him might be repeated and extended to his successors and that it might further be pointed out to him that His Majesty's Gov ernment have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia which involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country and includes the continuance of his present state of autonomy; external aggression on him would therefore consti tute an infringement of Persian integrity, which is recognised by the Anglo-Russian Convention.' 28. The last demands only a brief notice. The crisis arose as in previous years from the refusal of the Beni Turuf to recognise the Sheikh's authority as apart from the question of paying their revenue to the Persian Government. The first sign of trouble occurred in Hawiza itself whither the Sheikh was obliged in June to send a small force under Sheikh Hanzal to deal with his local representative Asad Khan. Asad Khan fled to the Beni Turuf and the expedition was more or less abortive. The Beni Turuf imbroglio began to develope shortly afterwards and was ren dered more acute by the return of the old firebrand Haji Sabhan. After considerable delay Sheikh Khazal, in the beginning of November, mustered a force, said to number 15,000 to 20,000 men, and an advance was made on the Beni Turuf country in the middle of November. No military operations of importance took place and the matter was in the end settled by arrangement rendered possible by a split among the Beni Turuf leaders, and resulted in the deposition of Ali Minaishid and Zahar Ali, and the appoint ment in their places of Mutailij, Asi, and Saleh_as the Sheikh's representa tives. This settlement took place early in December. Sheikh Ghadhhan, the Chief of the Beni Lam in Osmani temtory, appears to have acted throughout against the interests of Sheikh Khaza without however committing himself to any active steps. 29. A point to be noted is the steady tendency of the relations of Sheikh Khazal with Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit to grow closer.ANIT THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 25 In April Sheikh Mubarak lent his steam launch to Sheikh Khazal who came up in it to Nasiri, and at the time of the Beni Turuf troubles in August he gave him the support of his presence at Muzafferiya. 30. Bandar Nasiri. —Sheikh Hanzal has continued to hold the post of Deputy-Governor, and Sheikh Abdul Hussain has remained in charge of th« customs. Both have given satisfaction to the community in general, and to the European section of it in particular. 31. Nasiri continues to grow and many new houses have been built or commenced during the year. Among others in course of construction is one for Ghulam Hussain Khan and Haji Khasrau Khan, the Bakhtiari chiefs. 32. Haj i Seyyid Hussain, the neighbour of the Consulate, has so built up and added to his house as to surpass the Consulate in bulk and prominence. 1 if not in aesthetic merit. The proposed site for the Consulate has remained unoccupied but im mediately beside it, and in a position that will place it on the left front of the Consulate building, a building has been commenced under the orders of the Sheikh. The work has not been carried far and has indeed not been in progress since the Consul's return. 33. Owing to the failure of the rains in the preceding winter, the crops were a failure in Southern Arabistan. There was therefore no export of grain and business in general was dull. The price of grain, fodder and firewood rose very high at the end of the year, in consequence of the drain on local resources caused by the musteriag of the Beni Turuf expeditionary force at Muzaffariya. 34. Internal Affairs. —The Ilkhani and Ilbegiship continued to be held The during the period under review by the Samsam-us-Sultaneh and the Shahab- us-Bultaneh, now the Sardar Muhtasham, with the possible exception of the end of the year, when it is uncertain whether or not the Samsan was deposed.. The year has not in any case passed without the usual bickerings between the Khans. In April, while publicly asserting their complete unity a ad brotherhood, certain of the Khans approached His Britannic Majesty's Consul with a view to seeing how he would regard the removal of the Samsam from his official position and from his connection with the affairs of the Oil Syndicate. No encouragement was offered them. 35. Later on, in summer, a breach occurred owing to the Samsam's re fusing to take part in raising a contingent for the service of the Shah in Tehran. This disagreement has continued to fester, and has resulted in as near an approach to open hostilities as the Bakhtiaris of to-day are capable of. An attempt was made in December by the Samsam's opponents to wrest the local authority from him at Ramuz, but apparently without any decisive success. Much alarm was felt by the people of Ramuz who expected that the town would be made the theatre of operations, in which case they would have suffered at the hands of one or both parties. All however that appears to have occurred was some miscellaneous plun dering outside the town limits. Reports are very confused but it seems that about the end of the year the opposition began to yield to their usual fear of the Samsam's personality and were ready to treat with him. In reply to their advances it is stated that the Samsam laid it down as a sine qua non condition that the Ilbegi should be selected from the family of Reza Kuli Khan which for a long time enjoyed the distinction of furnishing that dignitary. This would mean the efface- ment of the Aulad-i ( ) Imam Quli Khan, the family represented by Ghulam Hussain Khan (Sardar Muhtasham) and his brothers. The only one of the Khans who appears throughout to have thrown in his part with the Samsam is the Muntazzim-ud-Dowleh, son of Isfandiar Khan. 36. The Shah's gratitude for the services of his faithful Bakhtiaris has been testified as in other parts of the country, by a prodigal bestowal of titles.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The principal changes are as follows :— Name.

The following Khans wefe-e in Europe during the period ander reive w:— Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Yusuf Khan, Murteza Kuli Khan. Occasion was taken by the first mentioned to complain to the Foreign Office of the attitude of Captain Lorimer. 38. External Affairs. —The year opened with the conclusion of an im portant agreement between the Khans and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. In April, Haji Khasrau Khan, Ghulam Hussain Khan and Nasir Khan visited Sheikh Khazal at Nasiri and proceeded with him to Failiya, and in the inter vals of their gambling bouts time was found to arrange a treaty the terms of which are given in an Appendix to this report. The chief points aimed at are a defensive alliance against aggression on the part of the Persian Government, and an agreement that neither party should support the subjects of the other when in rebellion. No very severe strain appears to have occurred to test the value of this treaty, unless, as it is said, the Bakhtiaris have objected to the Sheikh's ac cepting his relation Haji Saif-ud-Dowleh as Governor of Arabistan without consulting them. 39. It is interesting to remark that in course of their visit to Failiya the Khans were introduced to Sheikh Mubarak, whose acquaintance they put to use to arrange for the purchase and smuggling into Persia of rifles. .Whether the smuggling actually took place is however unknown. 40. The other principal feature of the year in the Khans' policy has been their committing themselves to the unqualified support of the Shah's party in the State. Immediately after the achievement of the cowp d'etat in Tehran, and no doubt in response to an invitation from the Shah, the Khans set about raising a contingent for the service of their Royal master at the capital, and eventually, in the end of July, Haji Khasrau Khan, Sultan Muhammad Khan, Nasir Khan and Jafar Kuli Khan, eldest son of Haji Ali Khan, arrived in Tehran with a force variously estimated as numbering from 600 to 1,000 sowars.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOB THE YEAR 1908. 27 Early in August, Nasir Khan proceeded with 200 of their men to Tabriz to aid the Shah's cause. This force appears to have remained there at least till late autumn and it is not certain whether it has yet returned. It is said to have sustained heavy casualties. Meanwhile in Tehran the Bakhtiaris had arrived too late to join in the loot, and the heat and dust of the Bagh-i-Shah was probably little grateful to the rank and file. At any rate the three chiefs there returned in September to raise a relieving force. It is stated that the tribes were unfavourable to the employment of Bakhtiaris in unremunerative service in the north, and that considerable difficulty was experienced in raising the new contingent. The Samsam's attitude in regard to the matter has already been remarked on and it no doubt further increased the difficulties of the other Khans. A force was nevertheless raised and passed through Ispahan on its way north in October. In an interview with His Majesty's Consul at Ispahan in September Haji Khasrau Khan himself expressed dissatisfaction with the position the Khans had got themselves into, but affirmed that it was now impossible for them to go back on the line they had taken up. He asserted that they had seen no hope for Persia in the Majlis and now saw none for it in the Shah—a very reasonable confession of faith. 41. On his way down in September Haji Khasrau Khan gave out that he had received orders from the Shah to take over charge of the artillery and arsenal in Ispahan and of the Chaharmahal and Faraidan Regiments, as well # of the roads in the Ispahan province. This at once brought him into conflict with the newly arrived Governor, the Iqbal-ud-Dowleh, who refused to part with these probably profitable appanages of his Governorship. Negotiations ensued but no result had been arrived at when His Majesty's Consul quitted Ispahan. 42. Things have since taken another turn, and it may be stated, though it does not fall within the limits of this report, that on the invitation of the people of Ispahan, Najaf Kuli Khan (the Samsam) entered the town in force in the beginning of January and usurped the Government, the Governor taking 'bast' at the British Consulate-General. This was probably a reply on Najaf Kuli Khan's part to his presumable deposition by the Persian Government following his refusal to proceed to Tehran when summoned by the Shah. He had already announced that he was ' Mashrutah Khwah ' (a supporter of constitutional government) and that if he were bullied he would go off and establish constitutional government in Ispahan. The old aristocrat, all whose tendencies are autocratic, is no doubt now engaged in this congenial task. His brother Haji Khasrau Khan has been commissioned by the Shah to eject him. 43. The Bakhtiaris and rhe British Government, eta—Requests put for ward by the Khans and by the Sheikh of Mohammerah for a specific declara tion that the British Government would undertake to guard their interests, led to a correspondence between the Indian Government and the Foreign Office with a view to determining what assurances, if any, could be given. In the case of the Khans the decision was arrived at that it was only possible to renew our assurances of general friendship. It was felt that any more specific assurances were only likely to result in our being jailed (Ji to champion the Khans in their differences with the Persian Government, m which they are at least as often in the wrong as m the right, under instructions from His Majesty's Minister, the general assurances referred to above were communicated by His Majesty's Consul to the Khans in September. 44. During the journey of His Majesty's Consul through the Bakhtiari country in the months of May and June, property to the value of 100 tomans was stolen on various occasions by night from his camp by the local tribes. E 223 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY Repeated reference made to the Khans has up to the present only brou ht about the return of about 30 tomans worth of the stolen property. 45. Bakhtiaris and British interests. —In the end of April a payment of The Persian Transport Company's outstanding 9,600 tomans Was made by the Khaim ckims - . against the Road construction account This was much in excess of the amount due on date and will cover the n ments due on 3rd March 1909. Payment was also made of the bill for the repair of the bridp^ • 1907. ^ m The Khans consented to pay the claim of tomans 279-9 for the Qui Madrassa robbery, but in spite of frequent reminders have as yet failed to do so. They have also steadily persisted in their refusal to pay the bill for th repairs of the bridges in 1904, amounting to some 1,500 tomans. Happily no fresh liabilities have been incurred during the year. 46. It will be remembered that examination of this bridge in September Repair of the Godar Bridge. 190 J 7 f TCaled that Serious Cracks had made their appearance m the masonrv of the piers. Nothing further was heard until the Company in March 1908 addressed the Foreign Office on the subject stating that it was necessary to affix some iron bands and asking that the necessary nesrotiations with Khans should be carried through. ^ &amp; w ine Under instructions from His Majesty's Legation, His Majesty's Consul entered into correspondence with the Khans on the subject. Eventually the latter agreed to pay a definite sum of 1,000 tomans for the repairs, a sum which was in excess of a rough estimate supplied by the Company's agent at Ahwaz. This offer was refused by the Company when the Foreign Office informed them that they could not see their way to pressing the Khans further in the matter. It has since come to light that the Company after taking expert advice had entirely altered their scheme of repairs, and discovered the necessity for a greater expenditure than had originally been contemplated It also became evident from the opinion of the expert that the defects in the bridge had arisen from an unsuitability in its design. Under these circumstances it appears questionable whether the Bakhtiari Khans are chargeable with the expense of the repairs, which are in fact structural alterations, now considered necessary. The matter is still under reference. 47. It was stated to the Consul by Haji Khasrau Khan that his brother Messrs. Lynch Brothers. ^ Ali Kuli Khan, who has been in . Europe during the past two years, had tins year obtained a loan of £1,000 at 6 or 8 per cent, from Messrs. Lynch Brothers. J 48. At the same time Haji Khasrau Khan stated that he was himself desirous of obtaining a loan from Messrs. Lynch Brothers of 50,000 tomans, as security for which he was prepared to allocate his shares in the road and in the Oil Syndicate, or to undertake to deliver consignments of produce in the villages he owns in the Dizful district. As the expediency of making loans to the Bakhtiaris is dubious in any circumstances, and in the present case the security was either insufficient or uncertain no particular encouragement was offered to Haji Khasrau and he was advised to enter into communication with Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Agent at Tehran on his return there. 49. Later, apparently in the month of November, Muhammad Jawad Khan (eldest son of Isfandiar Khan) proposed to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, through their Ispahan Agent, to sell them his share, which is 1/6, in the road tolls. Here again as the realisation of the share of the tolls would be dinicult, if not impossible, and it is questionable whether under the terms of their concession it is permissible for the Khans to dispose of their interest in the road to Europeans, it is unlikely that the matter will ever come up in a definite form.AND THE MASKAi. POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 29 50. No difficulty worthy of mention arose during the period now being Oil Syndicate. ^ ^ afiairS 0f ^ S y ndicate with the Khans. There seems no reason t/o question that this happy state of affairs, con trasting so strongly with the experience of previous years, is to be directlyi attributed to the withholding of the instalment of guard money due in November 1907, and the introduction of the Indian Oil Guard, two actions which respectively testified to our complete unsusceptibility to intimidation, and our firm determination to employ all reasonable measures to secure the safety of British subjects in the pursuit of their legitimate business interests. 51. The question of the retention of the Indian Guard has been already referred to in paragraph 4. It is only necessary to add that there has been no active improvement in the attitude of the Khans or the efficiency of their guards, and petty losses by theft have continued to occur from time to time. Compensation for such losses incurred up to the 30th June, was recovered by deduction from the instalment paid to the Khans on 15th November 1908, the Khans having failed to make payment in cash. 52. Rumours were current in August that the Khans were contempla ting selling their shares in the Oil concern. These shares are as a matter of fact not yet in their possession, nor indeed as far as is known in existence. Reference was made on the subject to the Legation who recommended that the Khans should be advised against such a course, as it was of impor tance for the security of the work that they should be directly interested in its prosperity. It was apparently considered impossible to prohibit the Khans from selling their shares when opportunity arose, or to compel them to sell them to the British or Indian Governments. 53. The Sardar Mukarram having recovered his position after his tem- Luristan. porary imprisonment by Nazar Ali Khan, appears to have maintained it till about the time of the cowp d'etat at Tehran. He was then replaced by the Amir Afkham, the head of the well known Hamadan family. The Amir's attention and endeavours have been chiefly directed to the attempt to collect the revenue. On the whole he appears to have kept on good terms with Nazar Ali Khan, whose assistance he enjoyed in extracting pay ment from some sections of the Bavanwand and Hassanwand. 54. The revenue of Luristan, which used to be assessed at 60,000 tomans, was raised by the Salar-ud-Dowleh to 123,000. The Amir Afkham has fixed his ambitions on 73,000 tomans. The system appears to be for the Governor to obtain ' Sanads (under takings) from one or more substantial individuals for the whole or sections of the revenue, and these individuals when necessary receive such armed assistance as the Governor can dispose of to coerce recalcitrant tribes into paying. It may be safely assumed that only a fraction of the revenue demand is actually collected. 55. During the summer the Kakawand Lurs were responsible for many depredations on the Kermanshah-Hamadan road. This tribe are dependants or supporters, but not subjects, of Nazar Ali Khan, Fath-us-Sultan and he was called on to take retributory measures against them, especially m regard to the robbery of Mr. and Mrs. Stead of the Hamadan American Mission. Up to the middle of November he had failed to take satisfactory action. . . The Fath-us-Sultan's new title, Sardar Akram, assumed at the time ot his capture of the Sardar Mukarram, is said to have been subsequently confirmed. . 56. Nothing of special interest has occurred during the year m the p U8ht . i .Kuh. afiairs of Pusht-i-Kuh. No attempt has been made by the Turks to wipeoutthedisgraee w 10 their arms suffered in the preceding year at the hands of the Wall, and border has been perfectly quiet.30 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY 57. The principal matter calling for note is that there appearsTT^ time to have been a serious intention of placing the Governorship of L in the hands of the Wali. The idea seems to have emanated from the S^rf 11 Mukarram after his troubles in Luristan last spring, and his idea wa he himself should stay at Burujird, while the Wali should come to Khur bad and be invested with the Governorship of Luristan proper with ^ freedom of action. It is understood that the Burujird Anjuman end ^ the Sardar's proposal, and that in Tehran both the Shah and the MaT were favourable to it. Orders of appointment for the Wali were recei H and were being despatched, and it is said that the Wali had begun muster his forces. n £ At this point the coup d'etat took place in Tehran, the Sardar Mukarram received his conge, and the envoy conveying the orders of appointment to the Wali turned back. It was felt that under the circumstances fresh con firmatory orders from Tehran were necessary and as these were not received the matter was dropped. This statement of the case rests on good authority but the Wali in mentioning the question of his projected appointment to His Majesty's Consul merely stated that the negotiations had broken down owing to his being unable to meet the conditions in regard to the Luristan revenue demanded by the Persian Government. 58. At one time there was a question of hostilities between the Wall's eldest son and Nazar Ali Khan, Fath-us-Sultan, but subsequently an under standing was arrived at, and in December the relations of the Wali and Nazar Ali Khan were officially described as friendly. 59. At the end of the year the sections of the Sagwand who have through out the year caused trouble in the Dizful district, from uncertain motives entered into negotiations for taking up their quarters in eastern Pusht-i-Kuh and actually crossed the Kerkha. 60. The fact of the Consul's journey through Pusht-i-Kuh in November and December has already been noted. The route followed was the most direct one via Shalakush to Deh Bala and thence to Kunjiancham. Trouble was experienced by the stealing of a horse by followers of Daud Khan, after wards recovered. Considerable difficulty was also found in obtaining es P ecia 1 11 3 r g r am and fodder, and at some parts the track was so dimcult as to make accidents to animals probable, though only one slight one occurred. At Dum Qalamun (on the Ab-i-Kunjiancham and near the dis puted Badarai border) the W^ali's camp was reached. Three days were spent with the Wall and several interviews took place. The only matter seriously discussed was that of Luristan road and reference to the Wali's views thereon has already been made. t S ^ one was f ? ie ? dl y anc ^ f r ^ n k. His regime is much more ^unsn than that of the Bakhtiaris which in externals shows many sisrns of Persian influence. b The difterence in essential methods is probably nil, and if his court appears less civilised this defect is more than compensated for by the fact • ^2 i 6 C ?; Se 0: ^ controlling power is invested in a single inaividual, whose authority in the present case appears to be very effective. In neither case does the exercise of authority appear to proceed much beyond tne collection of revenue and the mustering of forces when required for offence or defence. H . . himself is a young man and seems to be well endowed with intelligence. i, 62 ' T ] le acquaintance was made of the Wali's eldest son Amanullah Unan, and another Ghulam Shah (his second son). The former was not unprepossessing and in type took after his father; the latter was a fat p egmatic youth who looked out of place in a Lur camp. As far as is known the rest of the Wali's progeny are mere children. It is hoped to make Pusht-i-Kuh the subject of a separate report.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 63 ; I 116 I ? 1 arch . was continued to Deh Luran, whence a decision was made to visit the oil springs which occur at two points, one 5 and the other 20 miles to the east of that settlement. They are owned by Qaid Khani of Deh Luran, and he accompanied me on my visit to them. The more westerly group of springs produce only a very thick substance like pitch, the more easterly yield inflammable oil, but are somewhat inaccessibly situated in a gorge. A report on the oil springs and other allied matters has already been submitted. J Proceeding towards Arabistan part of the Bani Lam Arabs (Sheikh Asad), who pay grazing fees to Pusht-i-Kuh, were passed through and the Kerkha was forded on December 11th above Shush. 64. Kuhgelu history does not appear to have been enlivened by anv remarkable events since the date of the last Administration Report. ' ^ K * hgelu Beyond some reprisals committed by them in Bakhtiari territory and on Bakhtiari subjects nothing noteworthy has occurred on that side. 1 hey have not been responsible for any robberies of Lynch's caravans as in former years. The Kuhgelu were however said to be responsible for a series of robberies which took place on the Ispahan-Shiraz road on the north side of Abadeh in September and October. This would seem to have been an ex tension of their usual sphere of activity. 65. The Governorship of Behbahan, which includes the Kuhgelu, would seem to have been going a-begging. In September Haji Khasrau Khan Bakhtiari informed His Majesty's Consul that the Khans still had their ambitions fixed in that direction but that no immediate steps would be taken in view of the advanced time of the year, of which too little remained to make it worth while to accept the liability for the revenue. 66. Lieutenant Wilson's explorations and journeys in the Kuhgelu country have already been adverted to. Further acquaintance with their Chiefs was made by His Majesty's Consul who met Hussain Khan, brother of Ali Naqi Khan, the principal Chief of the Bahmai section, at Ispahan. Hussain Khan expressed friendship on his own part and that of his family, and a desire that the Consul should pay them a visit. These advances are probably stimulated by the hope of getting the Oil Syndicate to start exploit ing in Kuhgelu country. The circumstances are favourable for increasing our acquaintance with, and knowledge of, this tribe concerning which or their country we have little definite information. 67. Messrs. Lynch Brothers. —Following up action taken by them British in the preceding hot weather, Messrs. Lynch Brothers began in April interests and to take active steps towards erecting a store for their goods at ArabisS., 1 ' Shalaili, the port of Shushter. No sooner, however, had they begun efcc - to cart material to the site than opposition was met from the Muin-ut- Tujjar's agent, Alam, and from certain factions of the Shushter people incited by him. It will be recollected that the Muin-ut-Tujjar laid claim to the ownership of the site which Messrs. Lynch Brothers had obtained from the apparent owners. His Majesty's Legation had previously declared that there was no question as to the ownership of the site and had directed that in case of necessity the authorities should be informed that interference with Messrs. Lynch Brothers in the exercise of their legal right would not be tolerated. Reference was accordingly made in this sense to the Sheikh of Mohammerah then at Nasiri, and de facto Governor of Arabistan, and he was requested to issue an injunction against the proceedings of the Alam. This he declared himself unable to do, and he required instructions from the Persian Government. Reference was made to the Legation, but in the mean time, in response to representations submitted by the Muin's Ahwaz agent, the Nazim-ut-Tujjar, categorical instructions were sent down by the then Prime Minister, the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, requiring the Sheikh to prevent theADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN 'GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY prosecution of work by Messrs. Lynch Brothers. At the same time Sheikh Murteza, the lessor of the land to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, received an intimidating letter from the same quarter, threatening him with confiscation of his other property, should he interest himself in land which he, the Nizam- us-Sultaneh, personally knew to be the property of the Muin. As, owing to the attitude of the local people instigated by the Muin's agents, an attempt to continue work would probably have resulted in violence, operations were suspended pending the arrangement of the question, and in the meantime the Consul left for the hills. Matters remained in this position until in summer the Legation obtained from the Muin copies of the documents on which he proposed to base his claim. These were sent to Messrs. Lynch Brothers at Ahwaz, with the suggestion that the matter should be settled in the local court, as Sheikh Murteza had declared that he only wanted to be confronted with the Muin's claims in a tangible form. No action had been taken before the Consul's return to Ahwaz in December. Owing to Sheikh Murteza's absence, and to Messrs. Lynch Brothers' disinclination to face the risks incurred in running the gauntlet of any local court, which would presumably be venal and in consequence a mere tool in the hands of the Muin, more especially where, as in the present instance there appeared to be no 'prima, facie case against them made out. On these latter grounds, that the Muin's documents fail to present any case, the matter has again been referred back to His Majesty's Legation at Tehran. It is curious to note that when returning to Shushter from a visit to Nasiri in connection with this matter, the Muin's agent, Alam, was accidentally shot dead on board the Muin's new steamer. 68. The ' Shushan —Owing to the theft from Shalaili of two bales of piece-goods which were intended to be shipped by the ' Shushan,' but which had not been delivered to the Captain, and to Messrs. Lynch Brothers' refusal to compensate the owners, a boy cott of the ' Shushan' was instituted by the Shushter merchants. Messrs. Lynch Brothers very rightly refused to yield pending the success of reference to the local authorities, and after running empty for one or two trips, the boycott broke down and the merchants made their peace. In spite of the competition of the Muin's steamer referred to further on, the ' Shushan ' had a particularly prosperous year. Indeed it is generally asserted on good authority that it has been running at a profit—the first year in its life that it has done so. This is to be attributed largely to better management by a careful Captain and the employment of two barges instead of one—also perhaps partially to trade and local conditions. 69. Messrs. Lynch Brothers had announced that they intended to increase their staff by the appointment of a second European at Ahwaz, but the gentleman named is known now not to be coming and no one else has come in his place. 70. The past has not been a prosperous year for the transport business on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road. A large decrease on the returns is to be looked for, and is probably chiefly attributable to general stagnancy of trade in the interior of Persia consequent on the political disturbances and the insecurity of tne routes which have been so marked a feature in the condition of the country. Various indications have occurred to show that Haji Rais is dis posed to exert his power unfairly to the advantage of the Muin-ut-Tujjar's boats and the prejudice of Messrs. Lynch's. A particularly flagrant case occurred in which he seized goods which a Shushter merchant had shipped by Messrs. Lynch. He had of course no lack of explanations to make, but the real grounds of his action are said to be beyond doubt. The action was reported at Mohammerah and did not come within the cognisance of this Consulate. Action in such cases is very difficult as the first result is to bring further trouble on the original native sufferer. Unless Haji Rais amends some strong action would appear to be advisable in the near future. 71. The Concessions Syndicate, Limited. —Oil was eventually struck in the first boring at Maidan Manaftun on May 26th. The supply wasANU THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YE AR 1908. 33 plentiful, and the best auguries were formed. Subsequently other borings have been successful, but work has not been pressed. 72. In the end of July Mr. Reynolds, the local Manager, left on the expiry of his contract and the management devolved on Mr. Bradshaw. Mr. Reynolds, however, was re-engaged for five years and has again replaced Mr. Bradshaw who left at the end of the year. The rest of the staff of drillers left at the same time and a new batch has since arrived. The staff will further be strengthened by the addition of a foreman who will hold charge when Mr. Reynolds proceeds on leave six months in summer, and of Mr. Bottomley, late of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who will take charge of the accounts. 73. Much work lies immediately before the Syndicate. Boring will be continued, but a more onerous task will be the laying of a pipe line to convey away the oil. This has been definitely decided on. It is rrobable that it will be directed to ihe island of Abadan on the Shat-el-Arab, where it will be necessary to acquire land for the works neces sary for the shipment of the oil, and possibly for a refinery if it is decided to refine before exporting. The acquisition of the land from the Sheikh will doubtless be a work of some difficulty, at least if any degree of reasonable economy is to be observed. Presumably the appropriation of land for the pipe line itself will also entail negotiations with both the Bakhtiaris and the Sheikh, although so far as cultivation is not interfered with there would appear to be no case for compensation. It is believed that the shipment of the piping from Europe will shortly be commenced. In the meantime a considerable wastage of oil is going on, as it has not been found possible to check the flow of oil from the first boring. A large tank lOO' x XOO' x 10' was dug at much expense and at present this is being filled, but it is believed that the oil will spoil by evaporation of its more volatile elements and this experiment will not be repeated by Mr. Reynolds. 74. A small market for the oil will presently be found in the ' Shushan ' which it has been decided shall use oil instead of wood fuel, an example which Mr. Reynolds is trying to get the Muin-ut-Tujjar's agents to imitate in the case of their steamer on the upper river. On the first finding of oil enquiries were also received from His Majesty's Political Resident at Baghdad regarding the possibility of putting it on the Baghdad market but it is not believed that these enquiries have led to any action. 75. Simultaneously with the laying of the pipe line, provision of telegraphic communication along the line between the works, Ahwaz and Mohammerah, will become necessary, and this necessity will probably also receive practical attention before long. Another novelty in immediate contemplation is the introduction of drill ing by electric power, which will effect a large saving in fuel. It is intended to recommence drilling at Mamatain, where work was abandoned last year. The plant is still in situ, and it will only be necessary to move it to new sites. It will be seen that there is a very large and varied programme of work in prospect and it is open to question whether one manager, who is to be cn leave 6 months in every two years, seconded by only one other individual, wno is a foreman rather than an engineer, will be able to supply the motive force and exercise the close supervision which are required. 76. The question of examining the oil supply in Pusht-i-Kuh with a view to exploiting it has also been under consideration during the year and though it seems not to have been viewed enthusiastically by the Directors, Mr. Reynolds appears to contemplate paying a visit of inspection to the field. The springs were visited by His Majesty's Consul in December, and general information regarding them and the routes leading o emADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY supplied to Mr. Reynolds. This subject has already been referred to in paragraph 63 of this report. The question of the retention of the Indian Oil Guard has come up for discussion during the latter half of the year, but no final decision has yet been made known. This matter has been more fully dealt with above, vide paragraph 4. 77. Karun Irrigation Scheme. —Nothing was heard of this project during the year. The attempt to keep records of the level of the water in the river was defeated by the destruction of the lower gauge erected by Major Morton This occurred in the autumn of 1907 and it was proposed that the Assistant Engineer in the Persian Gulf should investigate the question of erecting a new one in a more favourable situation. The question has not, however, been pursued to a practical issue. A temporary gauge was arranged by Lieutenant Wilson in summer but it shared the fate of its predecessor. From information received from Bushire it is believed that a concession for irrigation works in Arabistan has been obtained by the Minister for the Netherlands. 78. The Mohammerah-Ahwaz-Borasjun Telegraph Line. —The acquisi tion of British control over this line has been an object of our ambitions for several years, and its desirability goes on increasing. In the year under review matters were at last given a more practical turn by instructions telegraphed by His Majesty's Secretary for Foreign Affairs, acting on an understanding with the Director-in-Chief of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, dated 22nd August, directing that the Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Tehran open negotiations with the Persian Minister for Telegraphs with a view to acquir ing the management of the line. No information has however been received of the initiation or progress of negotiations. The lamentable failure of the telegraph service under Persian manage ment especially during the winter months makes the matter one of the first great importance to all commercial interests. It has been suggested by the local manager of the Oil Syndicate that as the Syndicate will have to establish a telegraphic system for the work it might be possible for Lhem and the Indo-European Telegraph Department to act in combination as far as the Ahwaz-Mohammerah section is concerned. 79. The Imperial Bank of Persia.—hi July, the question of the advis ability of starting a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Arabistan was under the consideration of the principal officers of the Bank at Tehran, and Mr. Osesar Hawkins, a Director of the Bank, who was at that time in Tehran, was in particular anxious to have the matter investigated locally. Owing, however, to the lack of any suit able officer to put on special duty for the purpose no steps were then taken, and there are no signs that further progress has since been made. Prima facie there would seem to be good grounds to warrant an investigation. The financial affairs of the Oil Syndicate are considerable and will certainly increase, and Messrs. ter Meulen and Gratama, in the absence of personal relations, find it very difficult or, as they say, impossible, to obtain fair treat ment from the branch of the Bank at Bushire and predict that, if the German Bank takes shape, a branch will certainly be opened at Ahwaz. Messrs. Lynch Brothers have entirely given up dealing with the Bank at Bushire. One difficulty which will always have to be taken into account is the want oi centralisation in the financial affairs of Arabistan. European business centres in Ahwaz, but the centre of native business is at Shushter, while both classes are to some extent represented at Mohammera . 80. Visitors. —The only-official visitors were Lieutenants Williams and Farren, I.A., on deputation to buy mules for the Remount Department. Owing to temporary disturbances on the Tigris they determine to make their way to the Kermanshah district via Ahwaz, w £ / they reached with their escort of 20 Indian sowars on the 20tii AP • After some difficulty in obtaining transport they moved to U 12AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1908. 35 intending to proceed from there via Pusht-i-Kuh. Owing to the unruly state of the Sagwand this proved impossible and they eventually made their way up through the Bakhtiari country and Faraidan. 81. Lieutenant Meade, LA., travelled down from Ispahan by the Bakhtiari road and reached Ahwaz on 5th June and left again immediately for India. J 82. Mr. Perceval Landon, coirrespondent for the ' Daily Telegraph,' travelled down from Tehran to Ispahan, where he applied to His Majesty's Consul for assistance to continue his journey through the Bakhtiari country to Ahwaz. The necessary arrangements were made and he left Julfa on 22nd August. To prevent misapprehension and misstatements he was carefully coached in regard to Bakhtiari affairs, and it is discouraging to hear that his published letters are full of mistakes and absurd opinions. This is on hear say, copies of the articles having not as yet been received here. Mr. Landon proposed to visit the oil works and actually did so, but it is interesting to note that he subsequently received from England a request that he should not do so. He had written home before leaving Ispahan to ensure that he should meet with a favourable reception by the Cojnpany's Agents, and this was the answer, which however he only received at % Ahwaz. He reached Ahwaz on 15th September and left the following day for India. 83. Political. —There have been no signs of Foreign political activity in Foreign the district during the year, unless a political significance be attributed to the !Si£ and tour of Herr Mygind, correspondent for the' Berliner Tageblatt'. This gentle man travelled down from Ispahan through the Bakhtiari country, and after a brief stay at Ahwaz left for Baghdad. From his articles it appears that he met some of the Bakhtiari Khans, but efforts to obtain any definite informa tion about his doings have proved fruitless. It is probably safe to judge from this that he merely played the part of a passing traveller and did not attempt to create any political relations. In his published letters he has brought charges of personal discourtesy against His Majesty's Consul. As he had never met the latter, and indeed was never within many days march of him, it would appear that either his intelligence or his honesty is defective. 84. During the absence of His Majesty's Consul, M. ter Meulen, Russian Consular Agent, in a fit of hot weather irritation, threatened with assault a Seyyid, a British Indian subject, who was at the time living in quarters adjoining M. ter Meulen's and was unfortunately rather noisy in his morning devotions. The case was referred by Mr. Ahmed Khan, to His Majesty's Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, but h,s the Seyyid had in the meantime left Nasiri and M. ter Meulen had suffered more in loss of dignity than we had, it appeared unnecessary to prosecute the matter further. It is not to British interest that M. ter Meulen should be replaced by any one else. His maladroitness makes him a British asset. 85. Messrs. ter Meulen, Gratama &amp; Co. —This firm has continued to Commercial, maintain its place as the only European rival of Messrs. Lynch Brothers in the locality. Owing to depression of trade the year has not been a prosperous one for them—a fact of which they make no secret. Mr. Gratama went up to Ispahan in May with the intention of starting an agency there, and remained till the end of September. He made special efforts to secure a share in the carrying business on the Ispahan-Ahwaz road, and a certain number of consignments for export were received from the Tobacco Regie, who, I understand, have always touna Messrs. Lynch Brothers' ways of business a stumbling block. It is not believed however that Mr. Gratama made much headway in building up a transport business. M. lor Meulen proposes to visit Europe in the ensuing year, probably leaving Ahwaz in February or March. Ill this case Mr. Gratama wi repeat his visit to Ispahan. ' f 235 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY 86. The Germans. —There have been no visible signs of German co mercial activity at Ahwaz or further north. m ' Precise information is not available regarding their prosrp^ h Mohammerah. ■ S at 87. Messrs. As far &amp; Co., of Basrah.—R&amp;zvk.\, the agent of this Compaiiv went bankrupt in August. This event had been long anticipated as also the fact that he had made away with his principal's money. An enquiry under the auspices of Haji Rais fixed his liabilities to Messrs. Asfar &amp; Co. at £1,000, which he is to pay up gradually, but Messrs Asfar's losses are probably in reality much greater. The Company is still represented at Ahwaz but appears to be doing no business at present. Eazuki himself returned about the end of the year, and it is said that he is starting business on his own account with a capital of some £8,000. 88. The French Mission Scientijique en Perse. —The members of the French Scientific Mission made their appearance at Ahwaz en route to Shush, in December, a little earlier than usual. M. de Morgan is not with them having gone to Tehran, whence he proceeds to Shiraz with a view to opening work at Persepolis, or in that neighbourhood. From the statements of the other members it appears that at length the attention of the French Government has fallen on the leisurely and expensive way in which researches have been pursued in Persia under M. de Morgan's management. They have no good to say of de Morgan, and, if anything, less still of each other whom they variously represent to strangers as adventurers of dubious rectitude and shady antecedents. An expert has been sent out by the Louvre authorities, it is believed to watch their interests and observe the others. This expert, M. Tascon 5 (?) states that for some years only articles duplicating what already exist in the museum and practically worthless have been sent home. He considers Shush worked out and prophesies that work there is likely to be soon discontinued. 89. Foreign Visitors. —Herr Mygind's journey through the Bakhtiari country to Ahwaz and Mohammerah has already been referred to in para graph 83. The only other foreign visitor was a French Countess, name unknown, who also travelled through the Bakhtiari country and visited Dizful, Shush and Shushter in June. She suffered some incivility from the children of Dizful and in trying to resist it came into collision with a ' fanatic Seyyid She left Shushter for Behbahan on 21st June. The Countess claimed descent from Napoleon and was an ardent Monarchist. 90. The Muin-ut-Tujjar. —In April, the Muin's new boat for the upper Karun commenced running between Ahwaz and Shushter. It is a screw steamer and this fact was found to give considerable trouble in low water, and during the summer the ' Muawin ' frequently took several days over the voyage, which has made it very unpopular with the native travelling public. The boat is now in a very bad state of repair and constantly requires atten tion. Add to this that she is run with coal fuel, which is very expensive, and only one conclusion can be admitted, that she must have been worked at a heavy loss. 91. The experiment of putting a European in charge of the boat on the lower river was tried, and Mr. Thornburn, lately in the British. India Steam Navigation Company^ service, accepted the post in the beginning of April. The experiment however soon proved a failure. Mr. Thornburn did not like his employers, nor apparently they him, and there was probably justice on both sides.and the maskat political agency foe the year 1908. 37 In the end of May, a quarrel between the captain and the native engineer, when the former was said to have been in liquor, was taken advantage of by the Muin's agents to dispense with his services. The ' Nasrat ' is, like its newer companion, in a bad state of repair and is only kept in a condition to run by constant tinkering. The Muin's Baghdadi Engineer is now permanently established at Ahwaz attending to the requirements of the fleet. 92. Jealousy between the Muin's various agents was probably the cause of his sending in September a commission to Haji Rais to examine their affairs and go into their accounts. The result of the enquiry which may be taken as an indication rather of the bribes received by Haji Rais than of the demerits of the respective agents, was that Agha Yusuf was found accountable for 5,000 tomans, the Nazim- ut-Tujjar was exonerated, and the resignation of Agha Muhammad Baqir was^ accepted. D. L. R. LORIMER, Caytain, His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz. Ahwaz : The 9th February 1909. Abstract of terms of an agreement between Sheikh Khazal and the Bakhtiari Khans. 1. Both parties will consider themselves at all times bound to the service of the Government and of the State, (Dowlat-o-Millat): should the Govern ment attempt to interfere with their rights in regards fiefs, they will unite to oppose such interference- 2. The friends of the one party shall be the friends of the other party, and the enemies of the one -shall be the enemies of the other. 3. Should any disturbance occur amongst the adherents of the one party, the other shall do all that is possible to bring such troubles to an end. 4. Should the Governments of Arabistan, of Behbahan, of the Kuhgelu country, etc., be offered to either party, both parties shall give a joint under taking as to revenue, and shall undertake the administration together. One party cannot accept it alone. 5. Should a Governor be appointed for Arabistan on the part of the Persian Government (Az-Taraf-i-Dowlat), the two parties will lend no assistance to him, until Government be compelled to give it to the two parties jointly. 6. Should lands, the property of the Government, be offered for sale, both parties will buy in conjunction; one party has no right to purchase alone. ^ 7. Neither party will farm the lands of Persian grandees (Auliya-i- Dowlat), unless the latter agree to bear the losses as well as to reap the prohts. Should it be desired to purchase such lands, both parties will buy in partnership, excepting in the districts of Jarrahd (Ch ab territory), Hmdiyan, Deh Mulla, and the banks of the Karun, in which the Sheikh alone may purchase land. 8. In view of the complete agreement as regards life and property that has been reached by the two parties, neither party will accept the statements of individuals,, and they will conceal nothing from each other. 9. Should differences arise at any time between the Khans, the Sheikh' will use his good offices to bring about a settlement. 10. The above ten clauses have been agreed on by the Sheikh on his own behalf, and by the Khans on behalf of themselves and of their families, should any individual of either party infringe this agreement, or prefer his38 administration report of the persian gulf political residency own advantage to that of the others, he will be considered a despicable sh less, and dishonoured man, and shall cease to be recognised by his own f amU 6 S alar A rfa.

There are distinct signs of progress to be seen, most of the bigger men are building, the Wazir of the province, Mohtasham-ed-dowleh, has improved his house very largely and now many of the rooms would not disgrace Europe; Moin-ur-raya, the chief stormy petrel of the district, has built a very fine ' rozakhaneh ' of which, if the exterior were worthy of the interior, the result would be worthy of note as an addition to the town. In short, there are signs that general progress is afoot. The province of Kermanshah is divided into the following 'Bulooks' and ' Kasabehs,' each under its own deputy governor.

Those, governors shown as ' appointed from city' are usually called 44 Naibs,' the remaining places are referred to as ' Hakim Nashin,' and the Governor is always referred to as the ' Hakim.' Kangawar is frequently under Kermanshah, but the Governor is nearly always Sar-i-Aslan, whose family have held that appointment for five generations. It is at present an independent governorship. Asadabad is sometimes, in fact, usually, under Kermanshah and some times under Hamadan. It is now under Hamadan, but the post of governor is at present vacant. In order to understand the references to them, which are frequently xnbes. made in the political notes, it may be well to preface a short statement show ing the principal tribes and their chiefs together with a general idea of their strength, such numbers as are given will only show comparative strength; since it is not possible to see even a moiety of the nomads the only authority available is Persian, as a consequence numbers given can hardly be con sidered even approximate.ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Political. In this respect the Persian does not necessarily wilfully mislead (thoueli he is apt to overstate where tribes are concerned in order to exaggerate the numbers of the irregular sowars at the disposal of the Persian Government) for he has no idea of numbers in the mass. &gt; Chief.

Last year's report compiled up to the 21st of March 1908, closed with the misdoings of the acting Governor, Azam-ed-dowleh Zengineh, who was officiating for his father, Zahir-ul-mulk, and who was cutting off heads and blowing men from guns in the recognised autocratic manner. His conduct received attention in the Tehran Majlis and he was finally dismissed in the middle of April, the Prime Minister demanding explanations of his conduct from him. Wazir Akram, formerly Governor of Kazvin, was appointed to be Governor of Kermanshah. The Kuhai tribe, taking advantage of the general anarchy, had refused to pay revenue and the Kalhor tribe were called out to bring them to reason, but, on hearing of the appointment of a new Governor, the latter returned to their homes. It may be remarked, in passing, that the Kalhors had no more paid revenue, than had the Kuliais. At the end of March, all the chiefs of the tribes met in conclave and resolved to telegraph, asking that Zahir-ul-mulk, Chief of the Zenginehs, should be appointed Governor, a most undesirable appointment, since the chief duty of a Governor is to keep the tribes in order. At the end of the month the newly-appointed Governor resigned his appointment and was appointed Governor of Tehran. Kaimmakam was then appointed Governor of Kermanshah, but no one expected that he would join his appointment. The Prime Minister ordered lhat Azam-ed-dowleh should be sent to Tehran for punishment for his offences, but, as the only person to carry out the order was Zahir-ul -mulk, the father of the culprit, it was not likely that it would be obeyed. In the meantime, there was no Governor or Deputy-Governor, and mat ters in the district went from bad to worse; the Kakawends, a Luristan tribe, crossed the border, the villagers fled and the robbers occupied the villages on the Tehran road, looting extensively near Bisitun and Chamchamal, about 25 miles from this town. The Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Stead of the American Mission were held up between Sehneh and Kermanshah while driving in from the former place which is about 30 miles from the city. They were robbed of everything they possessed, Mr. Stead being left with only a pair of trousers, his servan being stripped. Mrs. Stead, however, was only relieved of her jacket an outside skirt, indeed, she would not have been touched, had they realiseAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1908. 41 sooner that she was a woman. It is a curious fact that the Luristan tribes will not rob or molest women, and where two tribes are about to make peace women are often sent as flags of truce to complete the first arrangement, if there is any doubt of good faith in the matter. The country was now in an impossible condition, the Tehran road was rendered unsafe by the Kakawends, while all the tribes surrounding Kermanshah were fighting amongst each other, or rendering the district roads equally unsafe. For three weeks no one was responsible for anything in the town, there was no authority of any kind and it speaks a great deal for the tractability of the Persian that the city continued without getting into an uproar. Only two murders were committed and though the murderer, in one case at least, was known there was no one with any authority to punish him and he quietly walked out of the town. The Kakawends continued on the road and were evidently reinforced by other tribes for they divided the country into spheres of influence which they robbed in organised bands. Just like the English-Russian convention, as the local wags remarked. At the end of three weeks a large number of pilgrims from Kerbela had collected, and, being unable to proceed to their destinations, they ap proached the local muj tabids, who informed Azam-ud-dowleh that, as his brother Fakhim-es-sultaneh, as Governor of Chamchamal, received an a'low- ance for the upkeep of sowars, it was his duty to protect wayfarers on the part of the road which was committed to his charge. Accordingly, Fakhim-es-sultaneh collected a few sowars and said that he was ready to escort caravans of pilgrims; in addition some charwadars carry ing merchandise accompanied the party. The post was also ordered to start under this escort, but the driver of the waggon very wisely decided to allow the pilgrims to go well in advance. The Kakawends were awaiting their arrival and immediately opened with a volley which killed a horse belonging to one of the escort, whereupon the whole of that discreet body turned tail and fled leaving the unfortunate pilgrims to the attentions of the robbers, who stripped them. They were, however, unable to get away with all of the charwadars' loads, some of which were, in consequence, safely brought back. Fakhim-es-sultaneh, thereupon, demanded 10 per cent, of the value of these for protection given !! No posts were arriving from the Tehran side and the departing post was carried on horseback through the hills. Kaimmakam had justified prognostications by resigning his appoint ment, and it was stated that the newly appointed Governor, Shahzadeh Zafar-es-sultaneh, was to leave Tehran with troops, and would arrive in Kermanshah at the beginning of June. At the end of May Nasir-ed-din Mirza, son of the late Shah, arrived at Kermanshah from Kerbela with his mother and left for Tehran escorted to Sehneh by 100 Kalhor sowars and accompanied by all the pilgrims and otLers who had been waiting to be able to proceed. At the beginning of June, Dowletmand, the chief of one of the sections of the Balawend tribe and a very successful brigand, was enticed into a fort with the usual oaths of safety taken on the Koran. He was then stabbed in the back while eating. His death was a godsend to all the villages south-east of Kermanshah on which he was accustomed to levy tribute. On the 6th June a telegram was received from the Shah saying that he had removed from the government certain intriguers who had been serving their own ends instead of thinking of the benefit of the country. The same day news was received that the Shah had arrested Ala-ed-dowleh, Jelal-ed- dowleh and Sardar-i-mansur and had beaten the first named, further that the followers of Amir Bahadur were upsetting the capital. There was great uneasiness on receiving the news. On the 9th a telegram was received GfA§. ft | : s 1 ill I- I il ^ r ^2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY from Kesht and Mazanderan saying, that Muhammad Ali Mirza had been opposed to the Constitution from the beginning, that his conduct resembled that of Louis XVI and that the province of Ghilan renounced allegiance to him. Several hundred copies of the telegram were distributed in the town. An answer was then sent from here to the Shah's telegram saying that the people were glad to know that the Shah was doing all he could to assist the Constitution. A further telegram was received from Ispahan on the 14th June to the effect that the 14 cities of Persia, which formerly had _ the right to coin their own currency, had agreed to depose Muhammad Ali Mirza, under the terms of the Constitution, and that, as under the said terms, they had agreed to a Kajar as the sovereign, they would appoint his son to be Shah under a Regency. Kermanshah replied that it would follow Tabriz in its politics, a promise which it has hardly carried out and indeed could not for the tribes around would swamp it in ten days once the Shah's authority had been determined at Tehran. The new Governor arrived on the 14th June without a single soldier, indeed with hardly a servant. Foitunate^ IJie town was sick of fighting and the two parties were ready to make friends, for the moment at any rate. I was about to leave for Hamadan when the news of the Shah's coup d y etat, on the 23rd June, arrived. Notwithstanding all the brave words which had passed it was soon evident that the people of Kermanshah did not propose to do anything to assist their fellows in Tehran. Still I think that had not the telegraph office been seized, it is possible that the town might have risen, but, since the first authentic news which arrived was from the Shah himself and announced his victory, oriental like, the town accepted the fait accomfli. The seizing of the telegraph office was a sign that other than Persian brains were at work and the news which arrived of the part which Colonel Liakhoff had taken in the proceedings were simply confirmation of what was evident from the method in which things were carried out. The telegraph office is always considered as sanctuary in Persia and hither to, notwithstanding that it had worked strongly to his disadvantage, the Shah had not attempted to interfere with it. On this occasion the telegraph office was occupied and no news filtered through. It was believed in Kermanshah that the Czar had sent Russian Cossacks to assist the Shah, a thing which appeared quite possible to the Persian mind. Before the coup d'etat Zahir-ul-mulk, chief of the Zanginehs, had wired that the Shah could depend on all the Kurdish tribes, and offered his own services. Hearing of this, the chiefs of all the other tribes, being determined that Zahir-ul-mulk should not have it all his own way, came in and tele graphed offering 2,000 troops. Zahir-ul-mulk's offer had been refused, but the latter offer was accepted, though for 200 sowars only. This was an eventuali ty which the chiefs had not had in mind and they had great difficulty in rais ing the 200, for all the minor and small chiefs refused to go, saying that it would cost too much and they would never be paid. In the end 200 men of ^he Kalhor and Sinjabi tribes left in two parties respectively under Zargham- ud-dowleh, son of Daud Khan, and Shuja-el-lashkar, son of Samsam-ul- mamalek, for Tehran. On the 18th July, the Governor left for Kurdistan to insfal his Deputy there. He was, however, dismissed from the Governorship of KermanshaH while absent, and given the Governorship of Kurdistan, a favourite method of exiling an undesirable person. Shahzadeh Zafar-es-Sultaneh had been too busy on the Constitutional side to be a persona grata with the Shah. The Russian Consul, the Turkish Consul-General and myself made simultaneous complaints against the Karguzar Sharif-ul-mulk and he was dismissed soon after I left for Tehran. Syed Abdullah, the notorious Mujtahid in the Majlis, arrived at Ker- man shah under escort the day before I left and was supposed to be en route toAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. Kerbela. He was, however, stopped at Kermanshah and is still in durance vile at a village near. Affrays between the various tribes were constant, the object being generally loot, but the details would be uninteresting. Outside the city was quite safe. In the middle of August, the Kakawends once more crossed the Luristan border and commenced looting on the Tehran road, accordingly, Fakhim-es- sultaneh, son of Zahir-ul-mulk, was despatched with some 200 sowars, 400 sarbazes and some artillery to recover the lost property and punish the rob bers. They were supposed to act in concert with the Governor of Luristan, who was at Burujird. The only person who arrived from the other side was Fath-es -sultan, better known as Nazr Ali Khan, who is the head of all the tribes on that part of the border. Some of the stolen property, notably mules, was reeovered and a portion was sold back to the owners at profitable rates, the remainder being divided between Nazr Ali Khan and Fakhim-es-sultaneh. I was unable to get any satisfaction in the case of Mr. Stead, though the American Legation were pressing hard at Tehran. Shahzadeh Isa Mirza, the Postmaster, was dismissed and Akram-ud- dowleh appointed in his place. His dismissal was presumably, in a great measure, owing to my complaints regarding a lost registered parcel, but he has since been appointed to another post, a small present at Tehran being all that is necessary to attain such a result. Farid-ul-mulk, the new Karguzar, arrived at the end of September. On leaving Kermanshah in July I toured to Tehran via Hamadan and Kasvin returning by the direct route to Hamadan and thence by Kurdistan to Kermanshah. My time in Tehran was usefully employed in settling outstanding cases and the routes I followed were carefully mapped by the surveyor. It is of the greatest value to a Consul to have visited head-quarters, for the assistance it gives in his work subsequjently to understand the points of view of the Legation cannot be overestimated. I returned to Kermanshah on the 28th September to find Zahir-ul-mulk once more Governor. He had originally paid 25,000 tomans for the appoint ment besides a further 5,000 tomans later, being 30,000 tomans in all. His son and grandson had obtained the post for him by visiting Tehran and urging his loyalty to the Shah—the payments made adding cogent reasoning. Zahir-ul-mulk, however, agreed not only to collect the year's revenue but the outstandings of last year, which was a task impossible for him, and he would have undoubtedly lost over the appointment, if he had not been extraordinarily fortunate in the way that things fell out as described later. In the middle of October we were informed of the ShaE's intention to call a new Majlis in November. The announcement was not, however, received with the interest it deserved, chiefly because no one believed that His Imperial Majesty would do anything which he was not forced to do and thus attention was mostly directed to Tabriz. At the end of October, the bickering of the tribes which had continued half the year reached a head. There had been some dissatisfaction with Daud Khan in a section of his tribe and overtures had been made to Sartip Muhammad Ali—-till some years ago, chief of the Kalhors with a view to again conferring the title on him. Daud Khan had, however, collected his sowars and, f being in force, was naturally followed by the greater number of his tribe, with the result that Mahommed Ali was obliged to escape to Pusht-i- kuh, where the Wali entertained him and enabled him to return to Kerman shah. By this time, Zargham -ud-dowleh, son of Daud Khan, had returned from Tehran, where he had been received with great favour, though at first he g244 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY was thrown into chains over a dispute with the Sinjabi tribe. Gn ret ing, however, he had been granted the title of Salar-i-ikbal and a grant o/sn' sowars against the Kermanshah revenue. It may be remembered that ft was the youth who was so insolent to Major Baird and in consequence hA to apologise to me at Kasr-i-shirin. a( ^ Finding the Sartip Muhammad Ali at Kermanshah, he decided to an end to his pretensions by kidnapping him. This, accordingly, he d'H but it was, unfortunately for him, the 1st day of the mourning of the Ah and the wife and family of Muhammad' Ali rushed to the masjid weeping 1 ^ crying for justice. The townspeople and the priests took up the cry and th Deputy Governor—the Governor was out of the town and his son was actin was forced to take action, an opportunity for which he was really dad f he had no means of forcing Daud Khan to pay his revenue. Telegrams were sent to Tehran and the people, in accord for ono determined on action. e ' The Governor sent a message to Salar-i-ikbal saying that the Sartin— who had been sent out of the town—must be given up. Ail that this resulted in was an impertinent reply. The Deputy-Governor then sent telling him that the situation was serious. This, Salar-i-ikbal secure in the strength of his sowars, was unable to understand and sent a second rude reply. Azam-ud- dowleh then gave orders that the son of the Kalhor chief was to be seized and imprisoned. The latter, who was in a strong position in the house of Amin-ul-mamalek, the Kalhor agent, opened fire. He had, however, under estimated the fact that the blood of the people was up and indeed' he had every right to consider their spirit a negligable quality, but on this occasion he was wrong and he was besieged with great vigour on the 18th October. Salar-i-ikbal succeeded in defending himself for the day with some loss including one of the chief Khans of the Kalhor tribe. Khan Baba Khan Shiani. _ It is very possible that Salar-i-lkbal took the opportunity to kill the Khan himself, since he was getting too powerful for Daud Khan to be able to coerce. The Kalhor party had, however, laid in no provisions, and the following day they thought it wiser to surrender on the proviso that the Mujtahids of the town swore on the Koran that no injury should be done him, Salar-i- ikbal agreed to pay all arrears of revenue and to have Muhammad Ali returned to his family. These terms were acceded to on the understanding that they only held provided the Kalhor tribe gave no further ground for complaint in the interim. The following day there was a small fight between sowars of the Kalhor tribe and some of the^ Sinj abis who had been called in to support the town. The Kalhors were with the assistance of the townspeople beaten oft' with the loss of a few men on the Kalhor side. During these affrays, a considerable number of bullets were flying about, Consi l late 0 ffi ce was struck*, bullets fell in the garden and the Eussian and lurkish Consulates and also the Russian Doctor's house were hit. Daud Khan was extremely angry with his son for his foolishness, but he came to within one march of Mahidasht and settled the matter by paying up his revenue with arrears and leaving a younger son as hostage in place of balar-i-ikbal. Had this hostage been kept, it would have been well but, unfortunately, Zahir-ul-mulk returned to the town and immediately released him, presumably thinking it was wiser to be content with the money he had got, for he knows it would not be wise for him to be permanently on bad terms with the Sardar-i-muzaffer. A governor taken from a local tribe naturally thinks of himself, and not of the people of the town; the latter nad therefore wasted a good effort and had lost some lives in order to put some 2o,000 tomans in the Governor's pocket. Captain Lorimer had arrived at Kermanshah en route to Ahwaz, via rusht^-kuh, and I sent off a letter from him and one from myself to tho a i. My messenger, a Consulate courier, was seized by certain membersand the maskat political agency for the year 1908 45 Of the Kalhor tribe who took him two stages out of his way to Daud Khan a i)d his son Salar-i-ikbal. ine latter thinking that orders were beins sent to the Wali, under cover of my seal, to proceed against the Kalhors and punish them, opened the letters and read them. Owing to the state of the country and want of any strong Government it has been impossible to tret any redress for this action even after reference to Tehran, but punishment must be given sooner or later. In November, the Kalhor chief gave his support to the pretension of Habibullah Khan, the direct heir to the chief ship of the Siniabis The Kalhor tribe who had made friends with the Sinjabis in the beginning of the year, were once more at enmity with them. It has been mentioned that detachments of both tribes were despatched to the assistance of the Shah at Tehran. On lining up for the Shah's inspection, the Sinjabis put them selves in the place of honour. This the Kalhors, who are by far the larger and acre important tribe, refused to permit. The Sinjabis replied that theirs was the post of honour, since the Sinjabi tribe was allowed sowac by Government, which sowars they represented, whereas the Kalhoirs were only represented by a foot regiment, therefore the Sinjabi horsemen being regulars had the right of precedence of the Kalhor sowars who were temporary irre gular levies. Neither would give way and the result was a fight on the spot. The Shah was excessively annoyed and the chief of the Kalhor party was imprisoned, but was subsequently released and taken into high favour. Since this date the old enmity between the two tribes has been resuscitated. Sher Khan, Samsam-ul-mamalek, had been for many years chief of the tribe and a very efficient chief, but a certain section of the tribe was dis contented with him. Accordingly, when so powerful a chief as Daud Khan gave his assistance to Habibullah Khan, the whole of the Sinjabis went over to the winning side and Sher Khan was forced to fly, although he was Governor of Kasr-i-shirin. He, unfortunately, subsequently, took bast with Daud Khan which completely cut away the feet from under his friends, who were using all their influence with the Government at Tehran. Habi bullah Khan seized the Government of Kasr. In the meantime, however, Samsam-ul-mamalek's son who was on his way back from Tabriz, where he had with his detachment, formed part of the royal forces, returned to Tehran, and, apparently, succeeded in working up some influence against Daud Khan; the people of the town also, who had done much telegraphing on account of all they had suffered from the hands oi this man, no doubt assisted. At any rate orders came that Samsam-ul- mainalek was to be reinstated and the Governor was ordered to proceed against Daud Khan. Zahir-ul-mulk gathered together an army by calling in a certain number o his own regiment, collecting some sowars of the Kuliai tribe and gathering as many sowars as he could out of the town. On Christmas day he held a grand review, which was certainly an improvement on anything that has ever been seen in Kermanshah. The artillery paraded and did some very respectable practice sufficient to show that if they were trained, they might wake very passable artillery men. They were keen on their work, but there ^as, as may be expected, no discipline, and the Sergeant-Major waylaid the Qffimander-in-Chief on his way back to the tents to ask for a ' khillat ' for bis excellent shooting. Khan^ 6 WaS disbanded without having moved against Daud Habibullah Khan paid a bribe to the Governor, was confirmed in his position and Daud Khan arranged matters by similar means.

Thus his only object is to collect as much money as he can with safety. As far as for eigners are concerned, he might as well not be there for he absolutely refuses all responsibility for the past, a matter with which I have dealt under local administration. There is little doubt that a Constitution would be welcomed again by the bulk of the people though they are usually afraid to say so. Even the officials tell me, when in private, that it is the only solution of the question, that everyone, except a few who now have the power, really wants it, and that there is no question but that it must come. There is, however, a general scepticism as to Persians being able to re-organise the country without the assistance of Europeans. Turco-Persian There has been no development of this dispute within this district dSpit? during the year. Baneh is still occupied by the Turks. Imperial The position, with regard to debts of the Imperial Bank of Persia, is Per n 8 ia 0f considerably better than when last year's report was written. Many debts have been paid in, some have been regularised and others have been partly paid. At the same time, bad debts remain. Ismail Khan, the former cashier of the Bank, is still in Kermanshah, carrying on his business as a farmer and contractor, the English stores is practically closed, which is as well, for its condition shed no lustre on the name it held. Mr. S'oane, Manager of the Bank, carried off a Roman Catholic woman, formerly a servant of the Consulate, when he was ordered home on sick leave. He took the woman to England with him and the husband lodged a complaint at Tehran, which however Mr. Soane met by absolute denial. The Roman Catholic priest made a complaint to me, upon my forwarding which, Mr. Soane was called upon to resign his position in the Bank and is now at Constantinople. This official has always given trouble and his departure will be a relief to everyone. Nevertheless, his conduct and disgrace are unfortunate, for he is an oriental scholar of a very high order. Eussiau Mr. Pinne of the Russian Bank arrived here from Tehran on the 29th Eank ' August in order to open a branch at Kermanshah. He stayed about two months and appointed to be in charge one Mr. Aghans, an Armenian, originally employed in the Customs and, afterwards, by the Imperial Bank of Persia. Mr. Soane and Mr. Aghans did not get on together, the result being that the latter was dismissed. Mr. Aghans, who speaks both French and English, was for a long time in India, and has travelled a good deal. Missitn and' 1 -^- r - an( ^ ^- rs - Stead of the American Mission have been working in the British Kermanshah throughout the year. This Consulate protects the Mission for Bible SocSty. the American Legation as a matter of courtesy. We have made every effort to recover for Mr. Stead the value of the horses and property of which he was robbed in May as noted under the heading ' political,' but so far without success. Mr. Irrsich, a German employe of the British and Foreign Bible Society, accompanied by his wife and daughter, visited Kermanshah, en route to Baghdad, in November, remaining here from the 10th of that month till the 7th December. The colporteur of this Society, one Mirza Ephraim, is always at loggerheads with the American Mission. His removal would be desirable. I have had several times to act as mediator. weather and Notwithstanding that very little snow fell last winter and consequently many springs ran dry, the crops did very well, the price for barley falling at one time to 15 krans per 650 lbs. and that of wheat 30 krans for the same quantity. Bhoosa—chopped straw—was purchaseable at 10 krans. The year had a very mild winter and, perhaps, in consequence the summer was exceptionally hot; the quantity of stored ice being short oi the normal gave out in the hot weather, but, since there is permanent snow on the hills, the loss in such a case is not very severe, beyond that the price rises a little.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. £7 February is normally the coldest month of the year and the 15th July to the 15th August, the hottest period. March and April were the two rainy months while most snow fell in February. The rainfall was only 15-39 inches, the maximum heat 103-2 0 and the maximum cold 12-9 0 . The Persian year is not yet completed and the revenue is not collected. Rerenue and The Governor has had considerable difficulty in recovering his due and is I L ? c ^ Ad ' fear, likely to lose money. ' It is quite impossible for a chief of a local tribe to be a successful gover nor. The present occupant of that post, Zahir-ul-mulk, is absolutely hopeless and no doubt secure in the idea, which he has, that he will have the support of the Shah, on account of the loyalty he has displayed, has now refused to be held responsible for the losses of foreigners even during the period of his own governorship. He has also refused to allow the Russian Consul to send kis Mirza with a 'mamur,' who was going to the chief of the Kalhors with reference to certain robberies from Russian subjects. He neglects direct orders from Tehran on Customs matters and thus no work of any kind can proceed where foreigners are concerned. I have refused to accept the Gover nor's answers or those of the Karguzar to my letters and thus the situation stands at present, I trust that we shall be able to get Zahir-ul-mulk removed and a new governor put in his place. Our relations with the Russian Consul have been very satisfactory and I official have never had any complaint to make. M. Nicolsky is most friendly. Madame relation8 - Nicolsky was a little difficult at first and seemed to have a violent objec tion to most English people, but it was mainly due to the fact that she consi dered that she had been slighted by English visitors and more especially by Bank officials. It appears difficult, both for British officers and for members of the Bank, to understand that a certain ceremony is incumbent on them, and very few of them paid farewell calls on the Russian Consul on leaving. Many also did not call within the first week, some indeed not for two months till approached by me, while one gentleman did not call at all on the Russian doctor and his wife, though they were here together for a whole year. On these questions being brought to my notice, I succeeded in putting matters right but with some difficulty. It might be well to impress on all officers visiting Persia what are their duties in social affairs, since the trouble involved is little and the bad feeliag, subsequent on neglect, is out of all proportion to the event. I must confess that, in many cases, Madame Nicolsky had the right to be annoyed, though of a touchy disposition at all times. Our relations with the Customs officers are, as always the best possible, and we have received every courtesy from them. Since the Persian year does not close till the 21st March, it is premature Tr»d6. to make any remarks on the progress of trade, the details of which will be found in the annual trade report when completed. The year has, however, been satisfactory. Even Russian red ground cotton goods have been ousted foy British, though I regret to say that the quality which we are supplying is very inferior. This is due to the fact that a certain number of Hamadan Jews have migrated to Manchester from whence they order a very inferior quality of cloth to be made to sample. These goods they export to their friends iu Hamadan and Kermanshah. The names of these firms are as follows :— Isaacs Brothers &amp; Co. M. J. Somekh &amp; Co. Joseph Sassoon, Sykes &amp; Co. Yehouda Heskel &amp; Co. Shamash, Bros. &amp; Co. J- J. Ini&gt; Bros &amp; Co. E. Sf. Da,vid &amp; Co. M. S. S. David &amp; Co, The trade of Kurdistan is entirely Russian, except for cotton goods. For very, very many years, the Kurdistan merchants, mainly the Christians,48 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY have made an annual pilgrimage to the Nijni Novgorod fair, where the make their purchases and dispose of their goods. It would be possible / change this, now very unnatural, proceeding, but for the fact that the Russian merchants give credit and frequently long credit, thus enabling the Persiai merchant to delay his payment, a fact which always appeals to him even though he knows that he must be paying interest for his delay. Notwithstanding that 1 have written pointing out the value of thp Hamadan and Kermanshah markets, and that I have requested that Chambers of Commerce should be sent copies of my letters, I have up to date received no enquiries and no samples, except from two firms whom I approached direct. In woollen goods there is a market of £30,000 annually which is almost entirely in foreign hands and which total could be considerably increased, but apparently British merchants are frightened by the unsettled condition of the country. As a matter of fact the state of the country makes very little difference where important and reputable merchants are concerned It is, further, as safe to deal with such men as with their confreres in India for they cannot afford to leave unmet bills which are due, any more than could a merchant in a big business either in England or in India. The mistake most foreign firms make is leaving their work to agents who are Persians or Jews, but in either case unreliable men; thus bad debts crop up through sales to merchants who are unreliable as payers. The whole question turns on agency and if several companies would despatch here a good agent for a year as a trial, they would speedily be doing a large business, since not only would they supply the big merchants but the smaller fry and the retail sellers also. I wrote to the Cawnpore Woollen Mills in the above terms, but nothing has come of it. I then approached Messrs. Blockey, Cree &amp; Co., agents at Baghdad, and they have referred the question home to their head office, telling me that they have always known that the time must come for such a move. In the meantime, Messrs. Berk, Puttmann &amp; Co., the German Baghdad firm, have, as I am informed, taken a house in Kermanshah on a year's lease, with a view to starting an agency of the kind I have been suggesting for so long. There is a special opening for cheap boots and shoes not of the hobnail or farmer type, but tEe ordinary Oxford shoe and boot, both being of strong make with toes inclined to be pointed. When there is a branch of the Bank at Hamadan, it will give a great fillip to our trade. It is difficult to understand why one has not been opened before now. Kermanshah is a paying branch and Hamadan has about five times the turnover that Kermanshah has. European Dr. Bongrand arrived from Tehran on the 23rd April and after a short visitors. stay proceeded to Kasr-i-Shirin to institute a quarantine against plague on the frontier, in which work he was assisted by M. Cesari, at that time employ ed by the Customs department. Dr. Bongrand returned to Kermanshah with M. Cesari in June, having suffered greatly from fever, and returned to Tehran some time in July during my absence. M. Cesari quarrelled with the Customs department over some details and was finally dismissed. He died at the end of the year. Dr. Kurt Jung, Commercial Delegate from the German Embassy at Constantinople, was deputed by the German Goveriiment to study trade pros pects in Persia. He arrived on the 29th April and left for Hamadan (thence to Ispahan) on the 6th May. Lieutenant Williams, 4th Cavalry, Army Remount Department, arrived at Kermanshah on the 6th June in command of a deputation for purchasing mules. Lieutenant Farran, 4th Cavalry, his assistant, arrived with the main party of the deputation on the 14th June. Lieutenant Farran was invalided home, leaving Kermanshah on the 30th September.

REPORT ON THE KERMANSHAH CONSULATE DISPENSARY FOR THE YEAR 1908. Early in the year the dispensary was transferred from the.Consulate to more commodious quarters in the town, consisting of : Consular Surgeon's office. Hospital Assistant's office. Dispensing room. Two dressing rooms. Two small waiting rooms, patients, Operating room. One small ward for emergency cases. Hospital assistant's quarters. The dispensary was open from 1st—9th January, 13th April, 3rd Septem ber and 3rd Octo'Der, 31st December, in all 174 days. ^ During the intervals the establishment was on tour with His Britannic Majesty s Oonsu . H one for male and one for female50 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY A detailed statement of the attendance at the dispensary and the cla« of cases treated is attached herewith. The majority of cases treated wep 8 medical. Malaria was prevalent throughout the year, excepting the winter montbs Microscopic examination was made in the majority of cases, which wer found to be of the benign tertian variety. Mosquitos are abundantly found in the houses of the town owing to the insanitary habits of the people and the universal custom of having a water tank in 'the courtyard of the house which is used indiscriminately for cooking, drinking, and washing purposes This also accounts for the numerous stomach and bowel complaints. The types of anopheles found were M. culicifacies, M. funesta and M rossh. Tuberculosis in most of its forms was frequently encountered. Amongst children the type was mostly adenitis and bone disease, while the women owing to the pardahnaMn system, are frequent sufferers from lung affections' Men, in spite of the open air life they lead, often catch the disease owing to their insufficient dietary, venereal excess and habits of opium smoking. Leprosy is not commonly seen, and when met with is mostly of the tubercular type. No attempts at segregation are made and lepers for the most part make their living by begging. Syphilis in all its forms is common. So far no case of primary syphilis has been treated in the dispensary, as the disease in that stage is either treated by a native doctor or, more commonly, neglected. Gonorrhoea is infrequent. It is treated by the local talent. Most of the cases so treated sufier from gleet which however is disregarded. Ascarides is very frequently encountered. Most of the patients who come to the dispensary ask for santonin and now it is almost a routine practice to administer santonin in obscure stomach complaints. During the year 336 cases were seen. Rheumatic affections are common and are largely due to insufficient clothing and the exposed life the people lead. Diseases of^ the nervous system are fairly numerous, consisting for the most part, of sciatica, facial neuralgia, epilepsy and locomotor ataxy. 897 cases of eye complaints were treated during the year, the large majority consisting of granular ophthalmia and its sequelae. Respiratory diseases, laryngitis chiefly of syphlitic origin, chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma and emphysema. Digestive complaints. Gastritis and enteritis accounted for 496 cases, due to the unsuitable food of the poorer classes. Skin affections were frequently seen, mostly tinea favosa and syphilitic aftections. Only 2 cases of opium poisoning were treated during the year, which is surprising in face of the fact that opium smoking is practically universal. This may be due to the low percentage of morphine in Persian opium. Fifty-five operations were performed during the year. The more important operations were :— Removal of sequestrum of palatal process of upper jaw. Two excisions of rodent ulcers, in both cases at the inner angle of the eye. Fistula in ano. Lateral lithotomy, child 6 years old : 1 calculus uric acid 10 grains, 1 phosphatic 12 grains. Case of extensive phosphatic deposit on tubercular ulcer of the bladder was operated on by a Persian doctor under the impression that it was vesical calculus, unsuccessfully. Later 220 grains were removed piecemeal.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 51 Strangulated hernia, right side. Herniotomy.

Adamoff held charge throughout the year of the Russian Consulate M. and Mdm Petrofl did not stay very long in Kerman. It soon became noticeable that the anticipated pleasure of their company was dis appointed. Relations between the Adamoffs and Petroffs became more and more strained till one day early in May things seemed to reach a crisis and the Petrons leit at three days notice in anticipation of sanction. M. PetrofE himself went down to the bazaar and sold off his belongings by auction without reserve and returned to Tehran. The town remained in the hands of the Nazim-ut-Tujjar and Haii Local Ibrahim Naib-farrash until April when the Sardar-i-Motazid arrived As vomcB - the Salar-i-Mansur he had been here with the Farman Farina and owns several carpet factories m the town so that he was well-known and well informed on local conditions, and it was hoped that he would be a success as Governor. The hopes however were shortlived. He seemed afraid of any responsibility and to have only the one idea of keeping himself out of any fighting that might take place. He would not call back the Adil-es- hultanen into the town nor forbid him to come in. When the Adil-es-Sultaneh came m to the Bagh-i-Nishat and the Naib's party threatened to attack him and his sympathisers the Governor remained absolutely passive and prepared to watch them fight it out. Things remained in this unsatisfactory and tnreatening condition until the Shah's coup d'etat in June when the Naib lost his last hold on the town and fled to Mahun where he took ' bast' in tne shrine. The popular party in Bam did not collapse so quickly. The Rafat-i- mzarn who had terrorised Bam and Narmashir much as Haji Naib had done m Jierman collected a force with which he threatened to relieve the Naib at a un and to march on to Kerman. He moved with unusual celerity for ersia and it seemed as if the local authorities were going to let him find them i unprepared but they luckily got a force out to Mahun the evening before e item force arrived and in the morning, when the Rafat-i-Nizam tried to e ouch from the hills, the guns shelled the head of the column and drove inf H fi? -d ^ escaped out of Mahun disguised as a woman and in if ^ a f a t-i-Nizam with the news that the popular cause was hopeless fhp '^ ain : ^ orce retired crestfallen to Narmashir. Meanwhile ami Khans had called out the sarbazes and sowars and the Rafat-i- zam and his men found themselves cut off from Bam. They made a wide pTitr Ur ? n j roun( ^ to Regan and Fahraj, which belongs to the Rafat, and enched themselves there.

He no sooner got here than he wanted to return to Tehran and neither he or any of his suite could answer the natural question of why they ever came here. He made himself very cheap and greatly lowered the olgmty of the Governor-General and having made Tehran understand that he could not collect any money, his resignation was accepted the second time of asking, early in July, and he lost no time in starting for Tehran. After his departure the Sahib-i-Ikhtiar was appointed Governor-Gene ral and was reported to be coming immediately by It turned out, however, that immediately was used in the strictly Persian sense. He sat down in Kashan and wired for money to be sent, changing his nominee in the Deputy-Governorship when it did not arrive. After a lot of trouble and chiefly through the Adil-es-Snltaneh who though nomma ly only General Commanding the local forces was really holding things together m the town, some money was collected and sent to Kashan On receiving it the Governor be^an to make his preparations and when they were completed he started bv easy stages for Kerman. After a long halt in Yezd he at last reached his district and arrived at Rafsinjan about the middle of September Here he was delayed for some days trying to straighten out the very unsatisfactory state into which the district had got. His efforts have had no very evident results but he could not continue them indefinitely and came on to Kerman about the end of the month. He immediately set to work to remove the bad impression made by the Sardar's democratic behaviour by introducing the most rigid etiquette and exacting a greater respect than either the Rukn-ud-Dowleh or the Farman Far The lone reicn of anarchy had thrown the district into a state of chM The Governor of Baluchistan had discreetly retired to Bam; every petty chie who had been turned out of his fort by the Persians re-occupied and proceeded to re-build it. Bahram Khan, one of the most important chiefs, revived his claim to the fort of Bampur and proceeded to besiege thc govcrnor s ocum tenens in it. Said Khan, another important chief, directed his attention to the south and appointed himself customs officer on the south coast. The Rudbari Khans joined a looting expedition which was earned as far as Minab and then quarrelled over the plunder ^ d ^ e b ^ n f 0 gXn since in fighting against each other. Daud Khan the governor of Sirjan. had treacherously shot down Isfandiar Khan when quietly sitting at a ' rozakhana ' and so started a blood-feud with the Buchakchis wheh kep both sides busy repairing the damage to water-oourses and plantations inflected by ^ 0^*1 pfovided a fewWals. The districts of Baf and Jiruft had both found that they have no use for a governor and thc Ad Sultan and Muhammad Khan had been m Kerman and BamrespectivelysiM early in the year. Bands of Farsis and Baharlns had raided the w^tcrnwd north-western frontiers of Kerman, looting Sirjan and Meshed Rafsinjan. Bands of robbers had seated themselves on the ,, b ds and Yezd so that no caravan could get through safely wh ^ le ^ med of twos and threes all over the district robbed any unwary and unamea small travelling parties whom they conld come across. Baluchistan was the first to receive attention. Wali Khan w ^ p a !??°jV s governor of Bam and Baluchistan and ordered to advance at o' victorious army and raise the siege of Bampur fort. It was however oae thing to shell the Bam rabble from a safe distance but ^^te anotfi attack Bahram Khan and his Baluchis m the open, and no one exp to send Bahram Khan an ultimatum to surrender or to P re P^ e J or derer on The Persian Baluch does not thirst for war; he is only a retail n - ^ safe lines.

The old fashioned ideas of storming parties or sorties would lead to bloodshed and produce bad-feeling which was particularly to be avoided. After a sufficient delay in Bam Wali Khan marched on to Baluchistan and encamped within parleying distance of Bahram Khan, who was satisfied with the size of the force with him and consented to retire. When the Baluchis had retired to a safe distant Wali Khan and his army entered Bampur in state and despatched news at once to German. Having accomplished this he will probablv be satisfied to leave the Baluchis to their own devices, as they have been left for some years, so long as he can recover enough revenue to keep himself going and to stave off the insistence of higher authorities for more Sirjan was the next district taken in hand and Mirza Agha Mustaufi was sent to make peace between the two parties and to try and combine them in the defence of the district against the Fars robbers. His efforts were not successful and after making himself about equally disliked by both parties he was recalled to Kerman. The Mutaan-ul-Mulk was appointed to succeed him, but before he started the heads of both parties had come in to Kerman where attempts were being made to reconcile them. After much ^ f alld talk a tem Porary truce at any rate was patched up between them and they returned to Sirj an where the Mustaan-ul-Mulk was engaged in the two equally difficult tasks of extracting money from empty pockets and keeping off Fars hawks with Kerman sparrows. For the restoration of authority in Baft, Rudbar and Jiruft a large expeditionary force under Sartip Abdul Muzaffar Khan was collected at Mashiz and Muhammad Khan, Sartip of Jiruft, was ordered to collect his available forces in Jiruft to co-operate with and join it somewhere about Jxuabar. ihere being no special correspondence with either force and neither post nor telegraph throughout its area of operations, very little news of its p^tormance has come through. It seems to have met with opposition only m Kudbar where the total casualties amounted to one killed and two wounded, it appears however to have been successful in enabling the governors to return to their respective governments and is still busy in sweeping up the districts for revenue and, of course, for its own maintenance. No attempts have been made to deal effectively with the robbers who still rob and plunder at their will from the Meshed road on the north to the roads on the south-west below Sirjan. . Tl1 ® general situation now is that Kerman and Bam are cowed but simmering with discontent while in the districts a sullen but helpless peasan try are being fleeced of the little that robbery and chaos have left them The only people who are contented are the various bands of robbers whose only rear is that there will soon be nothing more left for them to rob. Although outwardly order and authority have been re-established, the last state of the district is worse than the first. The postal service has naturally followed the way of everything else Post, and got gradually worse and worse. No contractor would continue to go on replacing the horses stolen and the carriages burnt by the robbers indefinitely especially as the payments under his contract were becoming less and less egular. Practically about two out of every three posts from the north throu g h b y robbers and any letter suspected of containing anything gotiable was opened. Throughout the year parcels have accumulated under P 0 ^ 8 an( i advanced like attacking parties by short rushes tne next cover as opportunity offered. w „ The letters and papers gradually were reduced to the same tactics and were delivered frequently in accumulation of two or three and once even jour weeks posts. Annoying as such a state of affairs is one can only admire e solidity of the lower staff who continue even intermittently to carry the nuns, past places, in which they always ran the risk of being stripped of everything but their hats and trousers. No new telegraph line has been opened during the year and Bunder Tew„u.. as is still 300 miles distant as the crow flies and some 2,000 by the tele- graph wire.gg ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY Towards the end of the year messages were sent straight through from London to Karachi and even to Calcutta and direct working is to be insti tuted shortly which will make Tehran simply a transmitting station and so set free a considerable number of signallers some of whom I hope will come here and make things easier for the men here with whom it now appears to be a case of all work and no play. As already mentioned no road has been safe from robbers. On the Meshed road they were strong and bold enough to hold up a caravan of 40 Afghans who put up a fight and lost four men killed. No caravan has got through from Yezd without being attacked and no caravan has made any attempt to go from here to Yezd for months. The Bunder Abbas road is the least unsafe as no band of robbers can settle on it conveniently or make much out of it. Almost the only goods coming up on it are brought up by the Af sharis on donkeys, and 30 or 40 of them, well-armed, come up together, each owning a few donkeys, so forming a party which nothing but a big band could tackle and no big band of robbers could find provisions or hold together for more than a day or two. The few camel caravans which come through come in sufficient force to be safe from the small bands of 3 and 4 robbers who make the road unsafe for ordinary travellers unaccompanied by armed escorts. The Imperial Bank of Persia has of course been affected by the stagna tion of trade brought about by the general insecurity of the country and has found business not very brisk. Mr. Simpson went on leave in July and Mr. Wright from Ispahan took over, the management from him. The Bank's new quarters are not yet completed but will it is hoped be ready for occu pation by next Naoroz. Mr. Bice, Secretary of the Ispahan Committee of the Church Missionary Society, came to Kerman in April and in spite of the Bishop's orders forced through the transfer of Mr. Liddell to Yezd and replaced him by Mr. Scorer, who had come from Yezd to marry Miss Adamson, one of the nurses of the Society. He however professed himself una r ble even to represent the advis ability of transferring Dr. Dodson to Yezd and bringing the Yezd doctor here and left me to write to the Bishop in Ispahan. The Ispahan committee apparently have no authority over the doctors who are governed more or less by a central medical committee in London. This committee was faced by the objection of Dr. White to having his hospital in Yezd upset by Dr. Dodson, and presumably finding a like objection to his exchange with any other doctor in charge of a hospital decided to close the Kerman hospital and to send Dr. Dodson to Ispahan to go through the course of training under the doctor there which he ought to have gone through before he was given independent charge of a hospital. The matter took so long to arrange that the political situation here had completely changed before the London com mittee had arrived at any conclusion, and Dr. Dodson had at last been persuaded that my representations had got to be listened to and had lett off performing operations recklessly so that by the time the decision of the committee was communicated to me I was able to inform them that Dr. Dodson's removal was no longer necessary, while a considerable European community had gradually been formed here relying solely on the Mission doctor for medical aid so that it was a serious matter to suddenly withdraw this without warning. My representations together with those of the native community, whom the Mission had educated to appreciate European medicine and surgery within reason, have only been able to delay the closing ot 6 hospital, the fact being, I am told, that funds are scarce and that the Kerman Medical Mission, which at first paid a large proportion of its expenses trom fees and contributions collected locally, has lately practically ceased to assist in its own support. The Committee have at any rate refused to reoonsiae their decision and the hospital will be closed early in 1909. The very scanty rains of last year made the crops lighter than they might have been, especially as to the yield of straw, and consequently ^ prices of wheat and barley have been high, and that of kah^or chopped s ra ' inordinately so. A sharp bout of cold late in the spring nipped all the ru trees and there was consequently practically no fruit this year. Khabis aAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 59 the gardens in the more sheltered valleys however sent in supplies and Kerman was not left altogether without fruit. The rain this year has fbeen good and the weather normal and prospects look favourable. The hills round have their usual quantity of snow though the line at which it is lying appears considerably lower than usual. There has not been much snow on the plain itself and no unusual cold to account for the low line on the hills. It has been a relief to at last have a properly constituted authority with General whom to deal and to have peace and order restored in the town. It has been possible again to get cases settled and claims paid and so justify one's exis tence. The chief worry and worst drawback of the place has however become worse than ever—namely its aloofness. Even the Persians themselves are beginning to feel this and to realise that there are desirable things to see and obtain beyond their present limited horizon, and would welcome any facili ties for enabling them to see and obtain them, but above all would they, or at least ninety per cent, of them, welcome any one who offered to bring them what they have heard of but never seen—namely a free, just and strong government. C. DUCAT, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Kerman.CHAPTER V. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE DISTRICT OF BUNDER ABBAS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING 31ST DECEMBER 1908 General General— T \\ q prevailing scarcity, generally unsettled cbaracter of rule remarks. and petty jealousies created by frequent changes in officials, have led to state of affairs which in the districts can only be described as chaotic \ the past year disturbances were frequent enough and it is to be regretted that the tale of raids, revolts against authority and robberies during the year under review cannot be said to have been any smaller. Material and economic progress has therefore been at a standstill if not actually retrograde Consulate buildings. —Good progress was made during the year with the new Consulate buildings and by December they were so nearly completed that it was found possible to vacate the old house at Naiband and formally take possession on the 1st January 1909. The new buildings have produced an excellent effect on the public mind, the political predominance of the British flag at this port being well typified by their superiority and extent. Rainfall. —The rainfall has again been far below the average and much scarcity prevailed in consequence. Heavy rain fell only on the 6th, 7th and 18th to 20th January, since when none has fallen. Harvest. —After the heavy rain in January a good harvest was anticipa ted but the absence of any rain subsequently caused the crops to wither and the harvest therefore failed, and in consequence prices have remained high throughout the year. Meteorological. —There is no regular observatory station at this Consul ate and such records of temperatures as have been possible are given in the appended table. The Director-General of Observatories to the Government oV India has been approached in the matter of fully equipping the new ponsulate as a regular recording station on the lines of other similar stations in the Persian Gulf and it is hoped that he will view the idea favourably. Local Persian Changes. —At the beginning of the year Mirza Ismail Khan who had authorities, been appointed Deputy-Governor in November 1907 continued in office until replaced on the 17th April by Haji Mahomed Khan, a half-brother of His Excellency the Derya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports. He in turn was succeeded (as a result of the Derya Begi's own deposition) on the 27th July by Haji Amanullah Khan, Ikhtidar-i-Nizam, who had held the post for a brief period in the beginning of 1907. The Ikhtidar-i-Nizam has continued in office to the end of the year. The Karguzari remained in the charge of Mirza Abbas Khan, Amin-ul- Wazara, throughout except for a brief period in June and July when he was f orced to resign by the local Anjuman over a petty case regarding the sealing up of the property of the late landing contractor of the British India Steam Navigation Company. The Shamilat continued under the joint Kalantars Asadullah Khan and Mir Ahmed Shah until the close of the Persian official year in March when an attempt was made to dispense with the services of Kalantars and deal direct with the Katkhudas of villages. By the end of May this system had proved a failure, and Sarhang Baba Khan was appointed Kalantar after promising Ts. 12,300 as the revenue for the current year. Asadullah Khan having large interests in the Shamilat then proceeded to make things un pleasant for the Sarhang who, however, succeeded in maintaining his position. At Lingah Safar Ali Khan held the Deputy-Goveriiorsiiip to the middle of June when he was replaced, as the result of an intrigue said to be instiga ted by c&gt;e Sadid-us-Sultaneh, the Russian Consular Agent, by an artillery officer, Haji Ali Karam Khan, who held the office to the end of the year.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOB THE YEAR 1908 ' 01 At Minab Sheikh Hassan Amin-i-Diwan continued i Governor until the 19th June when on his resignation'Mfr^Ghulam^H Rudani was appointed But the latter finding thf constant diss^nsio^ aid intrigues of the inhabitants too much for him also resigned witto three enci of the year ' ^ re-jointed in his placf held office to the In Kishm Sheikh Saleh continued in office but « ti . duced by the appointment of Sheikh Hassan as Zabit of Laft on June the 25th, thus making two Zabits responsible for-portions of the Island 0f ,1 ' , I', remained „ ,h. A ttitude.—The attitude of the local officials has on the whole been better towards this Consulate, with the notable exception of Sheikh Hassan Amm-i-Diwan, and at Mmab the prompt and conciliatory manner in which Kerbelai Mahomed Hassan used to settle cases is much missed. Moreover the authority of Sheikh Hassan in Minab appears to be of the slenderest description. Petty cases of thefts, debts and settlements of accounts, in the town when the debtors have not considered the sum sufficiently W to warrant their absconding, have, as a rule, been promptly settled The older and larger claims however continue to be evaded in the time-honoured way triW ^wt7 At r he ^ gi ? ni . ng of , the y ear the after-damp of the Baharlu P u M o tribes explosion noticed in last years report, was not dispersed until aboutr a ' :e!l n d , the middle of January, when on the disappearance of the tribesmen the q y - Buskre sarbazes returned from their camp in the Ginao hills and proceeded to tneir nead-quarters. In outlying villages small raids were not unfrequent, and the bolder and more impecunious spirits in the neighbourhood found that the absence ot any real opposition on the part of the local authorities as well as the latter s inability to exact retribution gave them as many opportunities for en.jcmng themselves at the expense of their neighbours as they desired. .

The agitationf52 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY was also augmented by the closing of the bazaars for an hour. The real reason for the incident appears to be that the deceased having possessed considerable property and a young wife of somewhat easy virtue whilst the existence of an heir was open to dispute, an array of facts was presented which opened up endless possibilities to all and sundry for a share in the estate, and that the fulfilment of these hopes was likely to be rendered difficult owing to the British Consulate taking action in the matter. These facts combined with the overbearing authority which the local ' Majlis ' (whose moving spirit was the arch-intriguer the Sadid-us-Sultaneh) produced this storm in a tea-cup. Subsequent representations from this Consulate brought about peace and the rendition of his seals of office to the Karguzar. In July the brutal murder of a servant by his master occurred in the Lari quarter of the town. The servant had been accused of a theft and on being ill-treated and tied up for a night to bring about a oonfession died. An attempt was made to hush up the affair but it was divulged by a fellow- servant and the crime expiated by the master being required to pay a fine of R300. At Sarkhum in August robbers successfully attacked the brother of the Kalantar of Shamil, whilst conveying the sum of R500 revenue collections in cash and made off with the treasure as well as the 2 rifles, 2 donkeys and a horse belonging to the guard. The outrage was committed in broad day light and none of the offenders were brought to book. In September panic was caused in Minab by the arrival there of about a thousand men under Ali Khan Minabi and Mir Ghulam Ali Rudani. Considerable looting took place and a number of the inhabitants fled to Bunder Abbas. Some British subjects suffered, whose claims for compen sation are still being pressed by this Consulate. Again in October another scare was caused in Minab by the descent of a number of Rudbaris, to withstand whom the Deputy-Governor was quite powerless owing to want of men. Towards the end of the year disquieting news began to come in from Lar, where the Seyyid Abdul Hussain had attracted a very large following by preaching that the payment of the Government revenue and taxes was unlaw ful as the Shah was employing the revenues to kill co-religionists in Tehran and Tabriz. The Seyyid's doctrine brought him a host of followers who seem to have t educed Laristan generally to anarchy, having turned cut, and in some cases murdered, the local Government officials. Trade routes. —From the above it will be apparent that caravans moving to and from the port have had more than their usual share of difficulties to contend with, and it is a fact that the Yezd route via the Tang-i-Zagh has remained closed almost throughout the year, and that only the very largest caravans have succeeded in winning through to the interior without loss. The disturbances near Minab practically^ closed the easterly routes through the Rudbari country for some time, but large caravans are now again using these. Aniuman,—This institution was touched upon in last year's report. In the beginning of the year a so-called ' Karaat-i-Khana ' (school-house) was founded by subscription, which gradually, under the efforts of the Sadid-us- Sultaneh, developed into the ' Anjuman-i-Jawid ' and the five trustees of the school-house became the ' Rais Ummumi-Millat.' This assembly sat twice a week and did its best at first to advise the local authorities in the way in which they should walk, but eventually culminated in general inter ference until it felt sufficiently strong to force the Karguzar to resign the seals of his office in June. In July however orders were received from the Governor of the Gulf Ports dissolving the Anjuman and prohibiting meetings of its members, a salutary measure which prevented in time the subversion of all authority and order. As'-a result of the inauguration of the Anjuman Haji Hussain Gelladary, Amin-ut-Tujjar, had acquired such influence that scarcely a single matter of any importance reached a conclusion without his being consulted by both the Deputy-Governor and Karguzar. Towards theAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 63 end of the year, however, there was a reaction—whether due to his arrogance or the fact that merchants had become tired of his undue influence interfer ing with their own busincjss^ is not clear and a round-robin was signed by some 50 merchants repudiating him as their leader, copies being sent to the Consulates and officials. Public health. During the year there has been fortunately no epidemic Medical, of a serious character. , Quarantine. —The quarantine arrangements at this port remained in the hands of Assistant-Surgeon Montgomery until July when he was relieved by Assistant-Surgeon A. W. Truter, who has held charge to the close of the year. , Captain White, I.M.S., Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, arrived at Bunder Abbas, his head-quarters, on the 11th May and remained until 24th June, returning again for another short visit in July. Charitable dispensary. —The work of the charitable dispensary has continued to be carried out by the Quarantine Medical Officer for the time being, pending the completion of the new Consulate. In 1909 it is intended to move the dispensary to the Consulate, when a Native Hospital Assistant will be placed in sole charge. It is to be regretted that the population do not realize the benefits of vaccination until an epidemic actually arrives to convince them, and this year no epidemio has meant no vaccination. Malarial fevers have again been the worst scourge and the 438 cases under this heading show an increase. Eye disease and skin diseases, especi ally ulcers, the result of neglect, show the next largest figures. These three diseases account for some 52-5 per cent, of the total admissions which amounted to 1,894 in the year under report. The charitable dispensary is indeed a boon to the poor who swarm in Bunder Abbas and now that free treatment has become a regular feature, the shifting of the locale from tlie Quarantine Medical Officer's house to the Consulate will bring yet more prominently before the public that their well- being is closely identified with the British flag. Changes. —Mr. Moses Khan continued as Director until the 3rd of May ^SnStra- when he was relieved by Monsieur Wagner, with whose appointment thetion. Bunder Abbas Directorship, hitherto subordinate to Bushire, was placed directly under the Central Administration at Tehran, a change which much facilitates the settlement of any questions between the Customs Department and merchants. The Customs post at Charbar, which had been closed since the last Baluch raid, was re-opened in March by the expedient of buying over an influential chief and maintaining a Customs launch at that port. An effort was made more than once to re-instate the late Hamal-Bashi Muhammad Ali but was defeated by the frequent representations of this Consulate and the protests of the local merchants. The Customs Mudir at Minab in February had the effrontery to cause the imprisonment of a British subject in chains, and suffered the penalty of dismissal for his temerity. Relations between this Consulate and the Customs admin istration have been most friendly, all differences, of which there were none of any great importance, being settled in the most liberal and conciliatory spirit by M. Wagner's good sense. Monsieur Leleux and Monsieur Wibier, Inspectors-General of Customs, visited the port in January and November respectively. Local stagnation, —Owing to the general disorder in the country and the commeroe. insecurity of the trade-routes commerce has suffered during the year. Merchants inland will not give orders when the chances are about even on or against the probability of their consignments ever reaching them and local Merchants in Bunder Abbas for the same reason have fought shy of import- what may be called 'expensive goods,' restricting ^themselves to the cheap necessities of life such as sugar, candles, flour, oil, etc. When theADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Customs figures become available at the end of March 1909 it is anticinat rl that the year's working will show a very serious falling off. German activity. —During the year 9 German steamers called on the out ward voyage, and of these 3 visited the port on the homeward journey. The' landed 16,152 packages (of which 13,410 were iron and steel bars and sheets y 1,511 sugar, and 35 synthetic indigo) and took away 683 packages, of which 507 were gum tragacanth. It has been rumoured throughout the year that the German firm of Wonckhaus proposes to open a branch at this port with an European Agent in charge, but up to date (February 1909) this has not been done. Mr. Brown the Lingah agent of the firm, and a Mr. Rumfeld, also a member of the same firm, visited the port for a few days. A M. Arratoon, employed by Messrs Wonckhaus arrived in Bunder Abbas in December from Lar where he had been sent to open up trade, a project he was forced to abandon owing to the local disturbances. A visit was paid to the port by the German Commercial delegate of the Berlin Foreign Office, Herr Ku/t Jung, to study possible openings for trade but his stay was of short duration and it remains to be seen what wai effected. Russian activity. —During the year 4 Eussian steamers visited the port 4 times on their outward voyage, landing 822 packages only, of which 500 were oil and 117 piece-goods; on the homeward voyage they also called 4 times taking 609 packages, of which 529 were gum tragacanth. It is difficult to see how these vessels can possibly pay even a moiety of their way on such results for a year's working, which it may be added are lower than those of last year. Settlement of claims. —A fair number of claims have arrived at a settle ment but the safety which Lar affords to fraudulent bankrupts has been utilized by more than one Lari trader, and the sum total of claims which have had to be referred to Shiraz for such action as the Fars authorities can take now amounts to over Krans 150,000. The whole of this amount is owing to British traders and it is to be feared is likely to remain owing for some considerable time longer in the present state of anarchy into which Lar has lately been plunged by the Seyyid Abdul Hussain. Small claims have as a rule been satisfactorily settled and on the whole with fair promptitude. Enterprises—A Monsieur Benedetto, an Italian mining engineer, accom panied by an Armenian interpreter, arrived early in the year and spent some months at the Muin-ut-Tujjar's sulphur quarries on Kishm Island; he left in April after having had to invoke the assistance of His Majesty's Consul to obtain the salary agreed upon and which was due to him. Though the landing of Pathans at Mask at has been interdicted with a view to minimizing the traffic in arms but little if any decrease at all has resulted. Arms now find their way to Bunder Abbas from Lar and are sold in the bazaars with impunity. The Customs administration made a few feeble and half-hearted attempts to take action which generally resulted in very small captures only. Pathans now arrive in Bunder Abbas in large numbers without camels or caravans and generally by mail-steamers, openly buy camels at exorbitant rates which they load up with a few loads and then move down to the Biyaban or Mekran coast where their real loads of rifles and ammunition for the north are picked up. The Deputy-Governor's tufangchis materially assist the nefarious traffic by carrying the arms from the sellers in the bazaars to the Afghans' encamp ments, the object being to prevent any Afghan laying himself open to the suspicion of being dubbed a gun-runner. A new method has been resorted to of late—that of sending Laris and Awazis to Maskat to make purchases of arms now that Pathan^ cannot themselves land at that port.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 65 In February the Customs effected a capture of 25 rifles and 30,000 rounds of ammunition on the Biyaban coast. In April they at last took tardy action against persons openly carrying arms in the town and the paltry result wab the confiscation of 4 rifles. In December a cache of 27 rifles and 90 Tabriz mans of ammunition was discovered in the premises of the firm of Jamshidian in the town, but on the representations of other merchants the Director of Customs was prevailed upon to simply seal up the premises with the arms in situ pending instructions from Tehran. During the year in all 66 slaves took refuge in the Consulate, with Slaves, complaints of ill-treatment by their masters. Of these 55 were granted free dom and the remaining 11 disappeared during enquiry into their cases. Of the total freed 11 belonged to Lingah and had applied for manumission through the Residency Agent there. The practice of manumitting slaves coming from the Arab coast was discontinued during the year as it was found that slaves who had contracted with their masters for pearlfishing and had received advances of money were obtaining freedom papers by misrepresentations to this Consulate, where it was difficult to verify their stories. In such cases they are now referred to the Residency Agent at Shargah or the Political Agent at Bahrein. Nothing occurred in Henj am during the year under review except some Henjam unpleasantness brought about by the Customs Mudir's threat to the Telegraph officials to create trouble unless he was removed from the place. The man attained his object—a transfer—through the representations of this Consulate, and the reasons for his desire for a change then appeared in the form of his irate creditors who threatened to seize the local Customs post unless their debts were paid by the Customs authorities. The Director of Customs having agreed to send his launch to Henjam to settle the claims against the former Mudir the incident closed. Persistent rumours were current as to the calcellation of the Muin-ut-Hormuz. Tujjar's concession of farm of the islands of Hormuz and Kishm and the districts of Minab and Khamir which eventually proved to be false, and those districts which the Muin held in fief are still in his possession. Six steamers called at Hormuz for cargos of red oxide of iron and of these one large steamer 'Euchandale' took over 4,000 tons to England. Small consignments of 400 and 500 tons were shipped by the Bombay Persia Steam Navigation Company's steamers presumably for the Indian market, Messrs. Strick only taking 1,500 tons. The total amount shipped during the year is some 8,000 to 9,000 tons. It was not until the end of the year that the telegraph cable question Telegraph arrived at a solution, when the Persian Government at last in November agreed to practically all the conditions for which the linking up of Bunder Abbas with the world had been delayed. In December the cable was brought into a new-cable-house further inland and a land-line carried thence direct to the Consulate whence another land-line was taken to an office in the town, the office in the Consulate containing the three-way switch by which the town and the Consulate are connected with Henjam. The Persian tele graphist who arrived in Bunder Abbas at the beginning of 1906 remained faithfully at his post for some 2^ years though without an office or a key, and then left for Shiraz, which delectable spot he had not enjoyed for more than a few months when by the irony of fate he was again ordered to Bunder Abbas. At present owing to the inability of the Persian telegraphist to read or send messages in Roman character the mercantile community are no gainers by the opening of the office. It is hoped that this state of affairs will oe remedied shortly. . His Majesty's Consul proceeded to Lingah in January and also paid axoura. vist to Bushire in March, since when no tours were undertaken.

The French gun-boat Surprise came in in February and soon after leaving port had to put back under sail, her engines having broken down- she left after repairs had been effected. ' The Persepolis ' paid three visits to the port during the year. The port was visited by an unusal number of travellers, mostly commer cial, among whom were Herr Kurt Jung, a German Commercial Attache' Monsieur G. Alexandre, a Frenchman travelling in the interest of a Marseilles sugar-refinery, a Mr. G. T. Guaye, representative of Messrs. Tate &amp; Co., the British sugar refiners, a Mr. Jacob Mashal of the Manchester firm of the same name, and a Herr Otto Brandly, a Swiss formerly in the employ of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., now travelling for the American ' Eastern Rug and Trading Company.' One Haji Mirza Abdul Muhammad, the editor of the Cairo paper Chehre Numa, who stayed some time studying local politics. Mr. Green, Superintendent of the Persian Gulf Post Offices, also made his annual inspection in February. Mr. Akers of the Board of Trade arrived in December and spent 10 days in Bunder Abbas in confidential enquiries into trade possibilities and German competition. He visited Hormuz but was unable to see the red oxide mines on the island. The Resident in the course of his tour in May visited the port but had no time to land. The First Assistant to the Resident arrived in December and left at once without landing taking Mr. Akers with him in the R. 1. M. S. Lawrence. Monsieur Ovseenko remained in charge of the Russian Consulate, until he obtained sick leave and left on the 15th October, having placed the Sadid- L us-Sultaneh (recalled from Lingah) in charge as Consular Agent, at Bunder Abbas. It is said that the Russian Government contemplates giving up its Consulate in Bunder Abbas, and the status of the post which for the present has returned to what it was before M. Ovseenko's arrival would tend to confirm the rumour. Monsieur Mathiew, Assistant to M. Ovseenko, also left Bunder Abbas at the beginning of November. The usual activity was shown by the Russian Consulate in the collection of news by a large staff of regularly paid spies, most of whom seem to be the scum of the bazaars of the Gulf ports. Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel continued in charge of H. M. S. Consulate until transferred to the Residency at Hyderabad on the 5th October. He spent 3^ months of the hot weather on privilege leave in England and during his absence the Head Clerk, Mr. P. S. Pereira, discharged the current duties of the office. Captain W. H. I.

In the early part of the year there were dissensions between Mir Haji and Mir Barkat-bin Abdul Nabi regarding the chieftainship of the district. Eventually matters were amicably arranged, Mir Barkat established himself as chief and a small piece of country in the north of the district was assigned to Mir Haji where he is said to be living contentedly. Mir Barkat has imported many rifles on his own account and by reason of this and also of the comparative wealth he has acquired by assisting Afghans in the arms traffic, he has become one of the most powerful chiefs in Persian Mekran. He has again during this year given active assistance to the Afghans engaged in the arms traffic. Jask District. There have been no disturbances during the year. The chiefs remain, as before, Mir Mustapha Khan-bin Abdul Nabi and Mir Hoti-bin Mir Ali. There is little of importance to relate but it appears that Mir Mustapha Khan has joined his brother, Mir Barkat, in assisting Afghans engaged in the arms traffic. Slave trade. —No reports of traffic in slaves in this district have been received during the year. Rainfall and products. —The rainfall has been inadequate. Although fair rain fell in January and February 1909, it was too late to benefit the principal crops (barley and dates). Gaih District. General. —Sardar Syed Khan continues to be the chief of the district. No disturbances occurred during the year, but the condition of the district shows no improvement. Early in the summer of 1908 Syed Khan is said to have entered into an agreement with Mir Bahram Khan of Dizak to make a joint attack on Bampur. Later however Syed Khan withdrew and Bahrain Khan made the attack himself. The Governor of Bampur fled to Kerman and Bahram Khan is said to have gained possession of the whole town with the exception of a fort which the Persian troops effectively held, but in November 1908 when Wali Khan, the new Governor of Bampur, arrived a settlement was made and Bahram Khan was induced to withdraw. The cause of this attack on Bampur is attributed to the prevalent belief that the Shah had been dethroned. The Governor of Bushire came to Charbar on the 1st December 1908, for the purpose of settling difficulties in connection with Customs affairs with Syed Khan and the Dashtyari chiefs but up to the close of this report, the chiefs concerned had disregarded the orders of the Governor to come to Charbar to meet him. Suh-districts. —The sub-districts under Gaih call for no remarks. Slave traffic. —Three cases of slave traffic, involving 11 persons, were reported during the year. Products. —Rainfall was good throughout the districts and it is antici pated that rice, barley, jowari and cotton will do well. The date crop will probably not be so good. Da'htyari This district remains as before under the joint control of Haji Mir District. Mahmud Khan and his nephew, Mir Din Muhammad. During the year they have become somewhat estranged, partly on account of money m^ ers and partly owing to Mir Din Muhammad's friendship with Mir Nawab Knan of Bahu, between whom and Mir Mahmud Khan there is bitter enmity, tneAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 69 District. cause of which is due partly to the fact that Mir Mahmud has always been a supporter of Mir Ahmad Khan of Bahu against Mir Nawab Khan, but chiefly to a raid into Dashtyari in August 1908 led by Mir Nawab Khan, in which Mir Yaghee, a brother of Mir Mahmud Khan, was killed. Excepting for occasional brawls between the followers of Mir Ahmad Khan, who has been living in Dashtyari throughout the year, and the followers of Mir Nawab Khan, the district has been quiet throughout the year. Rainfall and products, —The rainfall has been particularly good. Cotton, jowari and barley should do well and ghee which is one of the prin cipal products should also be abundant. The district is at present controlled by Mir Nawab Khan—Mir Ashraf Khan is also nominally chief of Bahu but has little power. No damage has been done to the telegraph line during the year but the district is in a very unsettled state—last year Sardar Syed Khan dismissed Mir Ahmad Khan and instated Mir Nawab Khan as chief. Now apparently Mir Nawab Khan is out of favour and recently Sardar Syed Khan has stated that he intended to reinstate Mir Ahmad Khan as chief. Mir Nawab will not it is thought submit to being removed quietly and consequently there is every probability that there will be a serious fight shortly for the chieftainship of the district, in which the Dashtyari district also is likely to be involved, owing to the enmity there is between Haji Mir Mahmud Khan and Mir Nawab Khan. The parties concerned are fairly evenly balanced and the issue therefore is doubtful, but if Sardar Syed Khan supports Mir Ahmad Khan, as he states he intends to do, it is likely that Mir Nawab Khan will be worsted. At present the telegraph subsidy is divided between Mir Ashraf Khan and Mir Ahmad Khan. It was suggested to transfer Mir Ahmad's share to Mir Nawab Khan but for the present until the situation develops no change is advisable. The state of the district is deplorable, the bulk of the population, owing to continued oppression, having emigrated to the north and to British territory. % Rainfall and products'. —The rainfall has been good, but there is practi cally no cultivation except in the neighbourhood of Babu Kalat. H. WHITBY SMITH. Memorandum on the smuggling of arms from Maskat through the Mekran ports for the period from the 1st June to the 31st December 1908. The system of land patrols and telephone stations described in last year's report was continued in full up to the end of June 1908. After that owing to slackening off of smuggling and to the departure of the Afghans from the coast it was found possible to dispense with 6 patrols, but all telephone stations were maintained throughout the year. On the 25th December 1908, two patrols were engaged and posted to the westward of Jask to watch the movements of Afghans who began to arrive on the coast about that time. The remaining four patrols, it has not been found necessary to reappoint. Last year's report described the operations of both the Afghans and the Baluchis for the full year 1907-08. This year's report is confined chiefly to the operations of the Baluchis as the Afghans did not begin to arrive on the coast till towards the end of December 1908, and up to the end of the year they had only landed one consignment of 400 rifles and about 40,000 rounds of ammunition. The importation of arms by Baluchis has continued on much the same scale as last year—during the 7 months covered by this report about 4,555 rifles, with probably 100 rounds of ammunition per rifle, were imported oy them, showing an increase of about 78 rifles only as compared with tne corresponding months of last year. Every endeavour was made to intercept landings arranged for by Baluchis, 'but as their consignments were numerous and made as a rule in small lots only, it was practically impossible70 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY to definitely locate them, and as it would have been obviously futile for H. M.'s ships to steam many miles up and down the coast on the chance of making an insignificant capture, the Baluchis were able to carry out their operations with very little risk or hindrance. Such losses as thev did incur before landings were effected more or less fortuitous. For instance 75 rifles and about 7,500 rounds of ammunition consigned to Mir Barkat bin Abdul Nabi of Biyaban and to people of Jask were thrown overboard off Kuh Mubarak on the 15th June 1908 on the approach of H. M's Redbreast, and 100 more rifles with 10,000 rounds of ammunition consigned to Mir Islam Khan of Bint were similarly disposed of off Khunarak on the 1st December 1908 on the approach of the Persefolis. In addition to the above the only other verified loss incurred was the capture and confis cation by the Persians of a boat on the 7th December 1908 off Bris Bunder after the landing of 500 rifles. Mr. New reports that the example of confiscating or burning boats, which are captured, is having a very good effect on Nakhodas and owners of boats who now demand liberty to discharge illicit cargo, if approached by Naval vessels. If the example can be ex tended it may have the effect of stopping the import of small consignments altogether and large importers will also be hampered by being called upon to pay higher rates by way of insurance against capture. In the latter part of November 1908 Captain Heath, with 50 men of the 110th M. L. Infantry, arrived at Jask to strengthen the military detach ment there. There has, however, been no cause for anxiety for the security of the telegraph station. It was thought that Mr. New while travelling along the telegraph line between Jask and Gwadur on his annual tour of inspection might possibly be interfered with and his escort was accordingly increased by a detachment of 30 Mekran levies. Nothing however occurred during his tour. H.

In itorie8 ' October the line was extended to Bait-el-Watayah. On December 15th, as the result of a quarrel, a local Arab brought a complaint against three of His Highness's Turkish guards. Saiyid Tainrnr, the eldest son of His Highness, found that the Turks were to blame and ordered their confinement in the fort. They refused to submit and were ■joined by their comrades. Saiyid Taimur then sent some Arab askaris to fetch them and gave instructions that fire was to be opened on the Turks if they refused to come. As the askaris approached them one of the Turkish soldiers fired in the air, and the Arabs in return fired into them and killed one and wounded another. The Turks then went before His Highness who took away their rifles and dismissed them all from his service. The men were subsequently despatched to Basrah by His Highness on December 21st. to -,., j o • - j at t The As Siahiyin.—On April 1st, the Sultans second son Saiyid Nadir was deputed by His Highness to Semayil in order to prevent the construction of a fort by the Siabiyin between Bidbid and Nafah. Saiyid Nadir seized and imprisoned three influential men of the Siabiyin and compelled the tribe to raze the fort. . . t p .r o- u- • -rr- tt - i. In consequence of the threatening attitude of the Siabiyin, His Highness the Sultan on June 10th sent Muhammad -bin-Bedr with 12 Turkish soldiers of his bodyguard to protect Sib. He returned on June 14th, however, as his force was too small to be of use. The Bani Ruwahah .—ln the month of April, desultory hostilities were carried on between the Bani Riyam and the Bani Ruwahah, near Zikki. In May the Wali of Zikki reported that 14 men of the Bani Ruwahah had been ambuscaded by the Bani Raiyam and that they had lost 9 men killed and five wounded. On May 14th the Bani Ruwahah revenged themselves by attacking •the Bani Riyam at Mati and killing eight and looting a great deal of property^ay ^eve was further fighting, and on May 31st, the Bani Riyam made an attack in force on the Bani Ruwahah at Ghubre ( y.y ) out were repulsed with the loss of 27 men killed. Further fighting ensued at intervals with losses on both sides, but at the end of August it was reported that the dispute had been settled. On August 8th, His Highness received news that the Bani Ruwahah had captured the fort of Sijah from the Bani Jabir. His Highness sent his son Saiyid Nadir to Semayil with 60 bags of rice , and 6,000 cartridges. The dispute was settled at the end of August, and Saiyid Nadir placed 30 of his men in the fort of Sijah to keep the peace. The total casualties during the feud were 34, and 10,000 date trees were destroyed. Saiyid Nadir returned to Mask at on September 23rd and a salute of 11 guns was fired in his honour. S ur ,—i n April, the head of the Bani Bu Ali tribe, Sheikh Abdullah- bin-Salim, came down to Sur. He refused to receive a present of 300 dollars sent to him by the Sultan and returned to Jaalan apparently m a nutt. Later in August Abdullah-bin-Salim again arrived in Sur with 150 men. About this time the Sultan received two letters from the Sheikhs at bur, stating that they intended to levy a 5 per cent, tax from traders to compen sate themselves for the trouble of settling cases. The Sultan replied object ing strongly to the proposal. The Sultan sent Abdullah-bin-Salim a present of 200 dollars, six bags rice and ammunition in addition to his subsidy of 300 dollars due for three months, in order to prevent him from stirring the troubled waters at bur. in September a settlement was arrived at through the medium of an agent whom His Highness despatched to Sur, and Abdullah-bm-Salim returned to J ^ a p ecember 4t j 1) ^ 0 f s ur reported to His Highness that 30 men of the Bani Eahsib of Jaalan had attacked Sur and had been repulsed with a loss of two men.w AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAB 1903, 73 Givctdur.

An unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of the Wall by 30 Sidi soldiers of the garrison on account of some dispute regarding pay. The ' Nur-ul-Bahar ' paid a visit to Dhofar in October 1908. She left Maskat on the 11th October with the predecessor of the present Wali, Bakhit Nabi, and the Wali of Merbat on board. She returned to Maskat on the 27th October 1908 bringing as prisoners seven Sidis who had made a murder ous assault on three of His Highness's askaris. A report reached the Political Agent that on the 16th October 1908 a dhow left for Dhofar with 200 rifles and the usual quantity of ammunition on board. The Sultan s customs remained under the same management as during customs, the previous year. Various complaints were as usual received from merchants ot the unsystematic methods obtaining and of the inefficiency of the staf employed. J?

On May 8th, the Government of India intimated that they were unable to accept the Eesident's new proposal, since it would amount to the purchase by the Government of India, of a certain amount of bullion at a price largely in excess of its market value. Quantity of imports. —The following table shows the number of cases of arms and ammunition imported into Maskat by ships flying British and German flags respectively between 1st April and 31st December 1908 Ships.

Sometimes 70 weapons are packed in a case. Taking an average of 45 to a case the imports of rifles during the nine months may be put at 80,190. But some of the cases marked as containing arms are said to contain revolvers and pistols so that the above total is probably liable to some reduction. Various makes imported and their prices. —Martini-Henry Government pattern condemned rifles, marked Nos. 2 and 3 respectively, commanded a very large sale during the first part of the nine months under review. They were sold wholesale at E37 for No. 2 and R42 for ffo. 3. Retail dealers sold the first for R45 and the second for R52. As the stock of these rifles is now exhausted, purchasers have turned their attention to arms of other make. Buyers from Koweit now purchase either the English or Belgian imitation Martini-Henry rifles bearing mark Mashallah or Sultani in gold letters. The former (English) is sold for R35 to R38 and the latter (Belgian) for E32 to R34. The market in Koweit at present is said to be very dull and therefore sales are small. Afghans ana Mekranis buy largely the Roumanian Government condemned rifles which have been recently introduced and which are sold for R30 to R34. The original trade price is E/25. They also purchase for sale to poor tribesmen a rifle of Austrian make called Cologogo (Werndl) which is sold locally complete with bayonet for RIO. The original price of these is shillings 8/6. The prices quoted above include 100 rounds of ammunition with each rifle. The average market price of a rifle with 100 cartridges at Maskat is said to be as follows English ... R38 (average is calculated from price o£ E35 to 42). Belgian ... ,, 31 ( ditto to 35). French ... »} 14 ( ditto ,, 12 to 16). German ... „ 20 ( ditto „ 10 to 30). Boumanian ... „ 30 (only of one kind). The export to the Mekran Coast. —The export of arms from Maskat to the Mekran Coast suffered more than last year from measures taken locally to restrict it. H. M. S. Proserpine captured a boat from which the arms had been jettisoned at the end of March. She also captured a small dnow on April 18th containing 1,500 rifles and ammunition. A boom engaged in arms running was seized by a Persian customs launch at the end oi May 1908, but the crew escaped with the arms. On June 18th, a dhow which was sighted by the Redbreast jettisoned 20 rifles and ammunition. On June 19th news was received that another ano sighted by the Sphinx had jettisoned 200 rifles and ammunition., AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. T- Early in December, a badan carrying 100 rifles with ammunition was boarded by one of H. M. ships, but the cargo had been jettisoned before she was overhauled. Shortly afterwards Persian customs officials in the launch Mazanderan captured a dinghy containing 12 rifles and 500 rounds of ammunition. The Nakhoda who was captured was fined R250 and beaten before being released. This is the sum total of successes. On the other hand, during the nine months under report, according to information procured here, about 18,000 rifles with 100 rounds of ammuni tion per rifle left Maskat for Mekran. According to information received by the telegraph authorities on the Mekran Coast a total of 16,375 rifles were landed with about 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition, and also a consignment of 500 revolvers. Exports to Gulf ports. —In August, two British India mail steamers were searched for arms by H. M. S. Sphinx in Maskat harbour and a few concealed weapons were found which were supposed to be destined for Koweit. Major Cox informed the Government of India that this course of action, if persevered in, would, in all probability, have a prejudicial effect on the ^menableness of the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sultan of Maskat. As no practical harm would result from temporary inactivity, since the traffic to Koweit did not immediately affect British interests. Major Cox asked the Senior Naval Officer to suspend activity pending intimation of the wishes of the Government of India. The Government of India approved the Resident's action. The arms which were seized were made over to His Highness the Sultan for disposal. According to information procured here about 16,000 rifles with 100 rounds per rifle were exported to Koweit, while 2,020 rifles went to other Gulf ports, Katr, Ras-el-Jebal and Abu Dhabi. Two hundred rifles and ammuni tion were also said to have been exported to Dhofar. Traffic with Somaliland. —In December 1907, the Political Agent was informed that the Italian Government proposed to send an Agent to Maskat to organise a service of information regarding the contrabandf trade in arms between Maskat and Italian Somaliland. The Political Agent was instructed to afford the Agent any facilities he might require. In January 1908, the Italian Government intimated that it was their intention to found, a regular official Consular Agency at Maskat and asked for the co-operation locally of the British Government both with reference to the Agent s ordinary duties and as regards the arms traffic. At the instance of His Majesty s Govern ment, the Italian Government agreed to defer action in the matter until the result of the Brussels Arms Trade Conference, then sitting, was made known. In October, the Italian Government again represented the necessity ot sending an Agent to Maskat, in view of the fact that there was little prospect of an early settlement of the arms trade question^ They stated that this mission would have no political aim, but would furnish valuable informationt and, in the circumstances, was the only means available to them for checking the important arms traffic between Maskat and Somaliland, where the atti tude of the Mullah made the matter urgent. . ^ ^ ^ , In the meantime, however, the Political Agent, Captain McConaghey, had been taking steps locally to prevent the exDort of arms to Somaiilan . On learning that some Somali dhows had arrived in Oman waters he made three trips in H. M. S. Sphinx along the Oman and Trucial Coasts ana collected the papers of 14 dhows explaining to the Nakhodas that the papers would be returned before they left Oman waters, provided that the cargo ot the dhow was found in each case to contain no illicit arms. e s gathered at Sur on their return journey and the papers of all but one which had gone on ahead, were returned to the Nakhodas there, after searc . - formation regarding the one that had gone on ahead was telegrap e . j O Aden for such further action as might be necessary. The Italian Government were informed in November 1908 of the steps which had been taken locally by British Officers, and it was suggested to them that the objects they had in view would be much better served by unobtrusive despatch, of a trustworthy native informer than bv app oin ting a Consular representative. The Italian Government accepted the view and jm m!

Brussels Arms Conference.—In April 1908, a Conference at which .britisn, French, German and Italian Governments were represented met at Brussels to consider the question of the illicit arms trade. Maior W P Grey, Political Agent at Maskat, and Captain W. E. Bowman, late of H M o. Sphinx, were deputed to attend the Conference, ^ After protracted discussion the Arms Conference was adjourned on Julv 20th until November 24th. The meeting was eventually still further post poned and the Conference has not reassembled at the time of writing. The following kinds of rifles are also imported into Maskat: Mauser repeating rifle (sporting), 5 shot. A rifle known as the Mauser Mackenzie, which has the name Francotte engraved on it, no magazine. Specially expensive rifles.—Oi the first kind about 2,000 are said by the local traders to have been imported for the nine- months and of the second ? onn?' i o ^ t0ms au t ho 1 rities ' however, estimate the quantities imported at 3,000 and 2,000 respectively. The repeating rifle is at present sold, with 400 rounds ammunition, for R120 to iU40. Formerly, its price was R200. Persians buy these rifles largely and also a few Mekranis and others. It is said that about 500 of them remain in stock. ® e ^ an manufacture and is at present sold at HlW to 120 with 100 cartridges. Not many of these have been sold during the nine months. a A double barrelled shot gun and rifle combined, of German make, is imported and also a similar weapon of English make. They are sold at present at E100 1 wlth 400 cartridges. Formerly the price was R130 to 140. is said that omy 50 of these were imported during the period under review and that some of them are still unsold. A three shot Mauser repeating rifle is also imported. Besides the above patterns several other kinds of more expensive rifles are imported but m very small quantities. Samples of Italian rifles marked ' Armata Romana ' and sighted to 1,200 yards are now on their way to some of the local merchants. Revolvers and pistols. —Revolvers and pistols of various kinds and qualities are imported into Maskat but the chief ones are- Mauser repeating pistol (10 shot). Browning pistol (Colt pattern). Mauser revolver. * y the ?v stoms authorities are 89,100 rifles, 760 revolvers and 7 ,954,500 rati a; ot ammunition. They calculate roughly at the rate of 50 rifles to a case.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908 77 About 700 of the first kind are said to have been imported during the nine months under review- These are mostly of German manufacture and are sold at iUOO with 400 cartridges.

Fifteen Africans and 21 Mekranis of 8liive9 * were granted manumission certificates while 5 Africans and 3 Mekranis were found either not entitled to freedom or went back to their masters, with their own free will and consent. Thirteen Mekranis came to this Consulate during the period with com plaints that their children had been kidnapped. The majority of them complained against the inhabitants of Shargah and the vicinity and letters were given them ^ to the Residency Agent, Shargah. Others complained against the inhabitants of the Batineh Coast and these received letters of recommendation from His Highness the Sultan to the local Walis. During the nine months under reference four manumitted slaves were sent to Karachi.

Tours. jRoyal Navy. F oreigrn Consuls. Medical work in Oman. —There is clear evidence that the work of th Agency Surgeons is being appreciated, more especially in Maskat and Matrah, but also in Oman generally. Many patients come from the interior (Rostak, Nizwa, Semayil, Nakhl, etc.) and also from the Batineh and Sur littoral. The total attendance of new patients reached 6,221 this year, an increase of 1,027 over last year and of 2,615 over the previous year. The attendance of the last two years is the largest since the dispensary was founded. The number of indoor patients treated has also risen to 150 from 83, also a record number. Two hundred minor operations were performed and nine selected major operations, the construction of the present operating room and the old fashioned equipment rendering it inadvisable to undertake others. A scheme is at present on foot to build a modern well equipped hospital with accommodation suited to the requirements of the different sections of the community here. His Highness Saiyid Sir Faisal-bin Turki, G .c .I.E., has been graciously pleased to interest himself warmly in this project. PuUvc health and quarantine. —The public health of Oman has been good this year. No epidemics occurred. The Agency Surgeon, as in former years, has been in charge of the quarantine arrangements of this port acting on behalf of the Local Govern ment. The Quarantine Eegulations have been more stringently enforced at the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. The khalasis, boatmen, and subordinate officers now wear a distinctive uniform provided by His Highness the Sultan. His Highness has also ap pointed a new quarantine subordinate and four permanent quarantine boat men. The rowing boat is also now kept ready at all times for quarantine service. These small changes have facilitated and improved the work of the quarantine greatly- The Political Agent, accompanied by the Sultan's Minister, Bedr-bin Seif, paid a visit to Sur on June 24th, in H. M. S. Sphinx for the purpose of settling a dispute regarding the stabbing of a Hindu trader. As the result of local enquiry it was found that the Bania was largely to blame for what had happened. The assailant was, however, fined R50 and confined to prison for a month. On October 1st, the Political Agent went on tour along the Batineh Coast in H. M. S. Sphinx and returned on October 5th (see under Arms Traffic, Somaliland). On October 7th, the Political Agent again left for Debai on tour and returned on October 13th. On October 28th, the Political Agent again left for Debai returning on November 3rd. On November 18th, the Political Agent left for Sur in H. M. S. Sphinx and from there crossed to Jask for an interview with the Resident. From Jask he returned to Maskat on November 22nd in H. M. S. Perseus. H. M. S. Hyacinth with Commodore Sir George Warrender, C.B., C.V.O., A.-D.-C., on board arrived from Jask. The Perseus, the Proserpine, the Sphinx, the Lapwing and the Redbreast visited Maskat on various occasions on duty. On April 8th, the American Consul, Mr. Wm. Coffin, left Maskat. Mr. Muhammad Fazil, a Khoja British subject, has since been in charge of the Consulate as Vice and Deputy-Consul. The Dragoman of the French Consulate, Abdul Aziz -bin-Muhammad Ar Ruwahi, went to Sur on April 8th for the usual examination of the papers of the vessels flying the French flag, on their return from Africa. He re turned on May 11th. On May 4th, Monsieur Laronce, the French Consul, was relieved by Monsieur Blanchon. On June 3rd, Monsieur Blanchon, the French Consul, died suddenly at midnight from heatstroke. The Agency Surgeon who was summoned didAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAE 1908. 85 everything possible to save him. His Highness the Sultan visited the French Consulate immediately on receipt of the news. The funeral took place on June 4th in Sheikh Jabir Cemetery which is approached by sea. The coffin was escorted to the place of embarkation by 12 Sepoys from the Political Agent's escort, and the funeral was attended by His Highness the Sultan his brother Saiyid Muhammad, by the Political Agenfthe AieSn V^ Consul and all the Europeans and Christians of the town. After the burial was complete, the Sepoys of the escort presented arms and fired a salute over the grave. The duties of the French Consulate were carried on by Monsieur Jeanne, the French Naval petty officer in charge of the coal depot. On November 2nd Monsieur Lecoutour, the newly appointed French Consul, arrived and took charge of his duties. A The i gunboat Surprise arrived at Maskat on 8th April and left F„ r ei g „ S i ip on April lotn. 0 f war On December 5th, the French cruiser D arrived from Diibouti on her way to Bombay and Indo-China. The usual official visits were exchanged and the D'lhermlle left on December 11 after landing 84 cases of cartridges as a present for His Highness for the use of the gun presented co His Highness about 10 years ago by the French Government. The rainfall during the period under report amounted only to 31 cents. E»mf .u and lor the whole year, irom January 1st to December 31st, it amounted to 0-92 weafcller ' of an inch. The rainfall was, therefore, very much below the average which is about 5 inches. The maximum temperature during the period was 114-8 recorded in June and this month also had the highest average temperature 102-2. The night temperatures were, as usual, high, the maximum recorded being 98-8 m June and the average night temperature of that month being 89-5. A considerable relaxation of temperature occurred in August, the maximum bemg 98-0 and the minimum being 75-5.

The period dealt with in this report has been uneventful in Trucial Oman. Truciai The chief difficulties have been caused by the bad condition of the pearl* 0man - market and the consequent inability of the merchants to meet their liabilities. The principal case of this nature was the bankruptcy of one Ali binAbuThabi Abeid bin Nasir at Abu Thabi. The Sheikh from the first assumed an obstructive attitude in the case. In May the Political Resident vigited Abu Thabi but was unable to induce the Sheikh to recede from his contention that all real property of an absconding bankrupt became the property of the ruling Sheikh. The question of coercing the Sheikh was referred to the Government of India, but it was decided that a further effort should be made to settle the case by persuasion. It may be as well to mention that since the end of the year another effort has been made in this direction. It was however unsuccessful as the Sheikh is insensible to argument. The question will be taken up again as soon as opportunity offers. The Sheikh's attitude has been rendered thus obstructive by his failure to obtain redress for his subjects in the notorious 'Taona' case. The Sheikh invariably drags out this case as a grievance and by reason of it his attitude in regard to all claims of British subjects has been unsatisfactory. The peace negotiated in June 1907 between the Sheikhs of Abu Thabi and Umm-el-Kowein, though once or twice strained, has endured up to the present and affairs in the Hinterland have been quiet. The progress of the Abu Musa oxide question has been noticed in the general report. After some vacillation and one or two abortive appointments, Sheikh Suggar nominated his uncle Sheikh Salim to be his deputy at Ras-el-Kheima in succession to his son Sheikh Khalid bin Suggar who died of consumption on 17th March 1908. Sheikh Suggar renewed his treaty with the Sheikh of Umm-el-Kowein. Debai has continued to prosper and the town is rapidly extending. The Debai. Sheikh's attitude has been on the whole satisfactory, but he is a weak and uncertain ruler. In December, Mr. Akers (delegate of the Board of Trade) visited Debai and was considerably impressed by its possibilities. Nothing worthy of note occurred in these towns and the conduct of the Ajman and Sheikhs has been satisfactory. Kowein. P. z. COX, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.CHAPTER IX. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR BAHRAIN FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING 31 st DECEMBER 1908. General. Bain fall and harvest. Public health. The period under report has been quiet in Bahrain, though fraught with incident on the adjacent mainland districts. The chief people of Katar are all in a sense on the verge of bankruptcy, though this condition does not affect them so severely as would be the case in other parts of the world, in view of the fact that their creditors who form the general population have no effective redress. All have to sink or swim together. In addition to, and partly in consequence of, this trouble, the Bin Tham family have been confronted with the danger of being reduced to a lower status by the intrud ing Turk, and the political situation in Katar will probably continue to require attention for some time to come. In Katif there has been civil war throughout almost the whole of the hot weather, and, though peace was in due time restored, the position of the mercantile and landed community, shaken by their losses,over pearls and robbed of a large portion of their date-crop, must indeed be calamitous now. In Hasa the state of affairs has not been quite so serious though the governorship of a weak Kaimmakam has allowed the turbulent sections of the populace to get out of hand and the audacity of the Bedouin has greatly interfered with trade. It is anticipated that the new regime in Turkey will soon improve matters in the Mutasarriflik though His Majesty's Govern ment may then find themselves confronted with a bolder assertiveness on the part of the Porte towards Bahrain and the other parts of eastern Arabia which have relations with the Government of India. With regard to the trade of Bahrain it is not possible yet to state positively how far a revival has occurred, but it is sincerely hoped that the Trade Report Statistics for 1908-09 will show a decided improvement on that of the preceding year. The year 1908 has been a very dry one in all parts contained within the purview of this Agency. In Bahrain the spring rains only amounted to 15 cents and the autumn rains to about 5 cents. On the mainland the drought in spring was equally serious, but one or two good falls of rain fell at the commencement of the winter which started satisfactorily the crop of grass. The date crops of Hasa and Bahrain have been estimated at 'eight annas '—output 1,000,000 and 175,000 tons respectively—while the crop of Katif would have been a ' six annas ' one, but for the destruction and looting committed by the Bedouin, which reduced it by one half, making the output about 120,000 tons. The health of the islands was good throughout the nine months under report and no epidemics of disease occurred either in 'Bahrain or in the adj acent mainland districts. As regards the working of the Victoria Memorial Charitable Hospital, Assistant Surgeon Monani gives the following figures for the years 1907 and 1908 for comparison, showing that the patients treated in the latter year were nearly twice as numerous as in the former :— In-door patients.

Political. —The relations of the Political Agent with the Chief and hisBahraiu. family throughout the year have been very good, and the same remark may be considered to apply' to the Bazar Masters and Kazis, though one instance of tyranny displayed by the Head Kazi, Sheikh Jasim bin Mahza, almost entailed a reference to the Residency before the matter was rectified by the annulment of the Kazi's action. The incident arose out of the unabated jealousy which exists between Sheikh Jasim and Haji Abdun Nabi Kal Ewaz, the Persian leader, attention to which was directed in 1904, when the Kazi was reprimanded for his connection with the disturbances created by the servants of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmad. The cause of this ill-feeling is not so much the difference of religious beliefs between the parties as that both men are keen purchasers of shops and godowns in the Manama Bazar, from the rent of which very profitable revenues are obtained^ though the competition for tenants frequently results in friction which is similarly also seen to in volve the two or three other interested landlords in the same line. In the affair under reference the Kazi had purchased from Sheikh Esa, under disreputable misrepresentation, a piece of a public road at the entrance to the Bazar, and in order to compensate the public for the narrowing of the way he then induced one of the Chief's most tyrannical servants. Almas, to break down and remove the seat-like masonry buttress which extended along the opposite side of the road under a wall belonging to a new arcade of shops built by Haji Abdun Nabi. The practice of building such foundation projections as seats is very common in Bahrain and many of them probably are encroachments upon the public road. Haji Abdun Nabi's brother and re presentative in this instance had protested in the Agency with the knowledge of the Kazi and his friends, while the Political Agent was away on a cruise, against the destruction of his buttress without investigation and before the act was committed. Strong pressure was therefore put upon the Chief to repair the damage prior to discussion, and this was eventually done at the Kazi's expense after the Chief had with difficulty been induced to inspect the scene in company with the Political Agent. The matter then lapsed into oblivion, as the settlement of the boundary question would probably have been very difficult to arrange. Another difficult dispute about boundaries, which was complicated by the aggressive enroachment on waste land of the Sheikh's cousin and Wazir (Superintendent of State gardens), Abdur Rahman bin Abdul Wahhab, while the case was suh judice, occupied the attention of the Agency throughout the year and was settled soon after its close in the form of a compromise arrranged between the Chief and the Agency, to which the three contesting parties gave a grudging consent, after the local (Shara) court had failed to pronounce a decision acceptable to the Agency. The two parties opposing the Wazir and, in a lesser degree, each other, were Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., as purchasers of a property from the heirs of the last Residency Agent, and an Arab pearl- merchant, Salman bin Matar, who is a naturalized British subject. The dispute had existed for more than 20 years but only reached the acute stage when both the Wazir and Messrs. Gray Paul proposed to construct substan tial buildings on the one site, shutting off at the same time the free approach of air from the sea to the third party's house. The chief historical event of the year in Bahrain was the return in 'August 1908 of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmad, after just three years' exile in Bombay. His former garden possessions have been returned to him by Sheikh Esa, but in lieu of the miscellaneous other sources of income he now receives a monthly cash allowance of R300 from the State, which is paid to him regularly through the Political Agency. In the circumstances the young Sheikh's future gopd behaviour seems well assured, and his conduct since his return has been irreproachable. He has apparently decided to make his home chiefly in Rif a, where the majority of the Chief's nephews and cousins reside and spend their da .ys hawking and coursing, when not entering into fresh matrimonial en gagements. NADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY In August 1908 also, the Chiefs confidential clerk, Ibrahim bin Sharida Najdi, a very intelligent man, died of the common local disease, tuberculosis He survived his father only three years, and has been succeeded by one Saqar bin Muhammad-az-Zaiyani, a Bahrain Arab, whose inexperience in draftinp letters to this Agency and ignorance of political etiquette in procedure Las on one or two occasions caused a little annoyance and led to improper actions against British proteges, but as such mistakes have been readily admitted by the Chief when brought to his notice, no awkward consequences have ensued In last year's report mention was made of a quarrel which had arisen between two Bahrein tribes of Arabs, the Dowasir and the Al-bu-Falasa when taking water into their boats at a submarine spring, in the course of which two men were killed. The affair reached a crisis on the 25th May 1908 when Sheikh Esa addressed a letter to the Political Agent stating that the Al-bu-Falasa tribe had arranged to migrate en masse to Turkish territory, and asking for assistance to check this move. In 1895 the British Govern ment had sent an expedition after the Al-bin-Ali tribe who had similarly fled to Zubara and commenced making a hostile demonstration against Bahrain from that port under Turkish encouragement. To prevent a possible recurrence of such events therefore the Political Agent summoned the two leaders of the tribe before him and after obtaining from them an admission of the correctness of the report he detained them in custody in the Agency for 25 days, at the same time pressing the Chief to expedite the judicial settle ment of the quarrel. In the result the tribe made their submission to Sheikh Esa in satisfactory fashion, paying the fine of RLOOO which he demanded of them and declaring their reconciliation with the Dowasir, which was effected in the Chief's presence at a meeting which all the principal men of both tribes attended. Sheikh Esa then asked for the two detenus' release which was duly granted. He had cordially and promptly thanked the Political Agent previously for his action at the time of the men's arrest. The case therefore seems to have been satisfactorily ended, as though the immediate relations of the two slaughtered men would apparently like to continue the feud, it is improbable that they will venture to disturb the tribal arrangement. The Dowasir's man was only a Baharani (Shia) servant, while the man in the Al-bu-Falasa boat belonged actually to the small Dawawida tribe or section, and the Dowasir allege that he was killed accidentally by a member of his own side. The pearling season proper of 1908 opened on the 24th May and closed ostensibly on the 22nd September. The take of pearls both in quantity and quality was stated to have been about 20 per cent, below the average, and many of the Nakhodas declared that they had not earned enough to pay expenses. Three hundred boats put out to sea again early in November and remained away for about a fortnight. Their labours unfortunately were not materially rewarded, and consequently at the close of the year the majority of divers have failed to receive from their employers the customary tisqam advance, which should help them to live through the winter. In August 1908, the local Agency of the Bombay Persia Steam Naviga tion Company was transferred from Haji Abdun Nabi Kal Ewaz to Abdul Aziz bin Haji Lutf Ali Khunji, the State cargo landing contractor. The alteration was probably the result of the change of management in Bushire where the old Agent had died, but Haji Abdun Nabi succeeded in recovering the appointment soon after the close of the year under report. The Turkish Postal arrangements for Hasa and Katif continued the same as in the previous year, until just upon the close, when Abdur Rahim bin Othman, who had returned to Bahrain in the autumn of 1908 for a few weeks, wound up his affairs here and departed finally, as is believed, for Basrah. Under the present arrangement the two outlying Turkish districts obtain their mails from Basrah direct in the small steamers, John 0. Scott, Kazimi, Jaffari, and Meqna, whose chief employment is lightering for larger vessels below the Shat-el-Arab bar. The Customs administration, managed by the firm of Gungaram Tikam Das, has worked smoothly throughout the year. It is roughly estimated thatAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOB THE TEAR 1903. 91 the Sheikh's^net receipts, in spite of the year being a bad one for trade, must have amounted to about lakhs of rupees.

One thousand two hundred and forty-one civil cases and 270 criminal cases were dealt with in the Agency during the nine months under report. The tightness of money has been felt during this period even more than in the previous twelve months, and a large number of the civil cases comprise the claims of foreign divers against their nakhodas for wages or shares of the boats' earnings. These cases were generally settled after refer ence to a ' Salifa ' judge and have been included in one of the two columns ' Disposed of without witnesses ' as the alternative methods of deciding them are either by inspection of the nakhodas' account books or by oath before a Kazi.

The Chief spent 25 days in camp, hawking and shooting, during the nine months under report. His sons, Hamad and Abdullah, went to Barr-adh Dhahran near Ojair for five days in November, and a fortnight afterwards to Lingah where they were at the close of the year. The second son. Sheikh Muhammad, was ill with typhoid for a long time, and therefore did not travel anywhere this year. Sheikh Ali bin Ahmad spent 10 days hawking in Barr-adh Dhahran during November and December, during which time he obtained the fine bag of 170 bustards (houbaras). Slave Trade. —Ten men, six women and four children were manumitted during the nine months under report- One woman returned to her master, who said that he had arranged for her manumission under his will, and that he had bequeathed her in addition a legacy of R50. Katar. The financial settlement mentioned in last year's report as having been agreed upon between Sheikh Jasim bin Thani and his creditors has not been adhered to in consequence of the impatience of the latter for their money and the unwillingness of the former to accept the prices offered for his pearls in Bombay and Europe. Eventually, after Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit had addressed Sheikh Jasim in very strong and threatening terms, the latter compounded and settled with all his creditors, when these had consented to reduce the price of pearls sold to the Sheikh about 75 per cent I As values are now slowly going up, being 50 per cent, better than they were six months ago, it may be considered that the cunning old Sheikh has come out very much to the good over the recent negotiations. Of the other pearls sent to Europe, both Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. and Messrs. E. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have been entrusted with consignments on commission, but so far neither firm has succeeded in eliciting a bid acceptable to the Sheikh. Another Katar case connected with the pearling industry which has given this Agency a good deal of work this year was the insolvency of Nasir bin Shahin at Tuwar, headmen of Euwairat village, and of the Al-bu-Kuwara tribe who also inhabit Sumaisma and Dha'ain in north-eastern Katar. This old Arab, who is related by marriage to Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, had gone down to Bombay in December 1906, possessed apparently of pearls which eventually under the auspices of the Bahrain majlis were sold for R65,971, but owing Rl,98,136 to twelve creditors in Bahrain. Half the pearls were safely mortgaged to certain of the creditors, and when the debtor failed to find a satisfactory market for the other half in India he returned to Bahrain in May 1907 proposing to keep the pearls in his own possession until better times appeared. In November 1907, the creditors began to clamour for per mission to sell the pearls held by them in mortgage and also for the liqui a tion of their remaining claims out of the pearls in Nasir s possession, i no being known at this time what the value of the latter might be. Nasir en gave a verbal undertaking to Sheikh Esa that he would not leave Bahrain until he had appeared before the majlis and come to an arrangement wi his creditors, but regardless of this undertaking a few days later he slippea off to his boat and fled to Lusail where he took refuge with Sheikh Jasim bin Thani. Negotiations followed until May 1908 when the Political Resident visited Bahrain and the creditors memorialized him, with res that the Political Agent was instructed to proceed to Lusail in tne steam launch and endeavour to persuade the fugitive to return unaer x. conditional safe conduct. The subsequent interview was not at farst irura , but a few weeks later the headmen of two other tribes in Katar, M Sultan bin Nasir as Suwaidi of Bida and Seyyid Abdullah bin Shamsan Ruwais, were induced to persuade Sheikh Nasir to give himseif up, iearing as they did that 1 the British Government mis-M retaliate against the Kuwara pearling fleet and inconvenience all the other tribes left weather if Nasir remained obstinate. For a few days Sheikh Nasir% AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 93 in Sheikh Sultan's charge, and then, as the latter refused to be responsible for him any longer and it was proved to the majlis that Nasir had concealed some of the pearls which he had taken out of Bahrain, he was taken into custody in the Agency on the 13th July until the settlement of the case, which was effected on the 10th August when the creditors of the insolvent signed an agreement which was ratified by the majlis. Under the terms of this agree ment all the creditors dropped half their claims, the mortgagee creditors were to realize^as much as they could with the knowledge and approval of the majlis from the pearls in their custody and the value of the un-mortgaged pearls was to be divided up rateably as expeditiously as possible. The debtor was to satisfy his Katar creditors out of his miscellaneous property, live stock, boats, etc., and any balance due to the Bahrain creditors after the divi sion of the pearl-money was to be liquidated in three annual instalments. The amount of this balance has now proved to be R33,096-10-4, and it remains to be seen whether Nasir bin Shahin will ever be in a position to fulfil his undertaking. In Wakra a recrudescence of the trouble, reported last year to have occurred between Sheikh Abdur Rahaman bin Jasim, the Governor, and the Al-bu-Ainain section of that town, has unfortunately been witnessed in con sequence of the tribesmen's reiterated objection to paying the annual boat- tax. For this the Sheikh fined the tribe 10,000 rials and demanded the expulsion of six of the headmen from the town. The Al-bu-Ainain then appealed to the Turkish authorities in Basrah for protection, sending as their envoy a fellow-tribesman named Ahmad bin Khatar, who is resident in Bahrain, with the request that a military garrison might'be established in Wakra. The envoy returned in due course from Basrah with two letters addressed to Sheikh Jasim bin Thani ' Kaimmakam of Katar' and the Turkish Commander of the Doha garrison, which seem to have had the effect of reconciling the two conflicting parties in Wakra, neither of whom was really anxious to see a Turkish garrison in the town. A fortnight later, when a new Mutasarrif of Hasa, Mahir Pasha, was passing through Bahrain, three members of the Al-bu-Ainain tribe from Wakra called upon him and informed him of the amicable settlement of their trouble. The whole incident is an unfortunate one so far as it has given the Basrah officials an opening for reasserting their authority over the Katar peninsula, though the claim has been vigorously repudiated by Mr. Crow, His Majesty s Consul in Basrah, and for perhaps assuming to themselves with some reason the credit of having settled the present difficulty. The Turks, however, are now beginning, to show a very decided tendency to assert their authority over the independent towns-people and tribesmen of Hasa, and it is reason able to conclude that if they obtain any success in this direction, they will not fail to establish themselves more strongly in Katar with a view to obtaining some revenue from the district, unless they are checked definitely by His Majesty's Government. The Katar political problem is therefore one which is almost certain now to call for early and serious consideration. The state of the two oases during the hot weather of 1908 was still more Hasa, Katif disturbed than at any period of the previous twelve months, indeedandthe^ possibly than at any time since the conquest of the districts by the Turks m tribal 1871. The vague news regarding the coup d'etat in Constantinople may ern orlea, have had something to do with this, but the intrigues of Abdul Aziz bin Saud and his representative residing in Hasa, Abdul Aziz bin Masnuq, very probably were the more immediate cause. The Mutasarnt at the commencement of the year, Rashid Pasha, was evidently a weak man w o appealed even to Bin Mashuq for assistance in the detection and punishment of crimes committed by the turbulent towns-people of Mubarraz and else where. Rashid Pasha left Hasa in July; he was succeeded for a tew days by Taufiq Beg, and then came Ahmad Mumtaz Beg who also left tor Basran in October. The Mutasarrif in office at the close of the year Mahir i^asna. seems to be a different stamp of man, one of his first acts haying been o warn Bin Mashuq either to quit Hasa or to abstain from interfering m public affairs, and another to apply for strong reinforcements of troops trom ±}asran. / inADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The caravan routes throughout the year were unsafe, but no att were reported until October when three small caravans, conveying dates f Hasa to Ojair on the coast, were looted. The non-occurrence of earlier rages was due partly to the fact that journeys of caravans were onlv md at rare intervals during the hot weather, and then under strong escorts a partly because all the tribesmen were congenially employed in the sie?' ^ ravaging of the Katif oasis. For their misdemeanours, the A1 Morra aH Ajman Sheikhs were deprived of their annual subsidies for several month but the payments were restored to them in November, before the arrival * Mahir Pasha in Hasa. Vdl ^ In Katif the misgovernment was still worse than in Hasa Th Kaimmakam, Muhammad Amin, seems early in the year to have endeavoured to put pressure upon the town and village people for his own pecuniary profit, first by demanding subscriptions for various local improvements then ordering a new census of the date trees, and finally by calling for an advance payment of the date revenue, ostensibly for disbursement to the militarv garrisons of Hasa and Doha (Katar). He proved himself amenable, however to bribes and none of the threatened measures were enforced, though in regard to the date census, a commission was actually sent down from Basrah to count the trees, with the result that after two or three villages had been dealt with it seemed likely that the result would require a diminution rather than an enhancement of the revenue demand, and the investigation was forthwith closed. After these events we find the Kaimmakam apparently on excellent terms with the Katiiis, so that when grave trouble occurred between the settled people and the Bedouin in June he failed to satisfy the latter, with very serious results. A comparatively restricted blood-feud had been proceeding since September 1907, as mentioned in last year's report, between some Bani Hajir Bedouin and the Shias of Saihat who have always lived in tribal fashion under their own Sheikh,' occupying a large walled and well guarded village with its date gardens separated by a strip of desert from the rest of the oasis. A fresh incident was added to this feud when the Saihatis attacked some Awamir Bedouin in a disputed date-garden on the 10th April 1908. In this connection three Saihatis and two Bedouins were killed, and the Saihatis thereupon put themselves into a state of siege. Six weeks later a fracas occurred in the town of Katif, started by a Bedouin and a water-seller, in which 40 persons were said to have been injured, and though the trouble was temporarily laid through the exertions of Haji Mansur Pasha, it was afterwards found that the Bedouin had only withdrawn until their friends could be summoned to join them in a vigorous attack upon the residents of the oasis. The Katif people themselves were also partly to blame, as they had tried to shut out the tribesmen from visiting the uncared-for gardens on the outskirts of the oasis to which the latter undoubtedly had a prescriptive right sanctioned by custom. Hostilities recommenced about the middle of July, one of the first acts of the Bedouin being to attack and loot two boats lying in the ' stream ' of Katif, of which one belonged to Bahrain. The Bedouin were now assembled in some thousands, and occupied themselves nightly in attacking the outlying hamlets and setting fire to all the thatched huts which were not contained within walled villages. Parties from the town of Katif including detachments of soldiers made occasional nocturnal sallies, but they seemed to suffer as much loss as they inflicted. On the 1st August the Kaimmakam telegraphed urgently to the Wali, through the Bahrain Post Office and Bushire, for reinforcements including a man-of-war and some artillery. On the 29th July, H. M. S. Lapwing arrived in Bahrain, but as she had grounded on a reef she was unable immediately to proceed to Katif to ascertain the true state of affairs there and to enforce the maritime peace, if there was any likelihood of its bein^ broken by piratical Bedouin. In the circumstances Lieutenant Commander Gouldsmith accepted the services of the Agency steam launch to carry an officer, Sub -Lieutenant Prideaux-Brune, R. N., to interview the Kaimmakam for the acquisition ofAND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1908. 95 general information and to ascertain especially whether there was any Drob- ability of piracies being committed, and what the Kaimmakam could do for their prevention. uu Lieutenant Prideaux Brune returned with a report that the Kaimmakam was actually being besieged m his town, that villages could be seen burning all over the oasis, that the Turks had no control over the Bedouin putting to sea, and that the latter were said to be encouraged and fed by Sheikh Jasim of Darin on Tarut Island, son of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Pasha The Kaimmakam also suggested that the surest way of disposing of the latter nuisance would be for the British gun-boat to arrest Sheikh Jasim and send him in custody to Katif for punishment. In these circumstances the Political Agent, who knew Sheikh Jasim personally, proceeded in the La'pwing to Darin, where he administered a stringent warning to the suspect and afterwards steamed along the Katif coast in the launch, landing at Dammam, Saihat and Anich, to ascertain definitely the state of some of the outlaying villages. Dammam contains only a ruined fort, once the possession of the A1 Khalifa of Bahrain, and it was uninhabited, but Saihat village and Anich fort were found to be in a state of siege, though the Bedouin who were stated to be in the surrounding date-gardens did not show themselves. The occu pants of these two outposts said that they had held no communication with the outer world, except very occasionally by sea, during the previous fort night, and that they were becoming inconvenienced for want of fresh provisions. The Political Agent then returned to Bahrain, and thereafter the Agency steam launch, flying the white ensign, the Lapwing and the Redbreast, which arrived on the 13th August, shared the duty of patrolling the waters between Bahrain, Katif and Ojair, for the intimidation of any Bedouin con templating a resort to hostilities on the sea, until on the 28th August re inforcements from Basrah were actually received in Katif. The people of Bahrain and Katif had previously been rather sceptical of the arrival of any assistance, as it was known that the civil and military authorities in Basrah were disagreed on the subject, The^ relieving force, which consisted of a Mirolai, Asma Beg, and 340 men with 5 guns, was however accompanied by the Mutasarrif-designate of Hasa, named Ahmad Mnmtaz Beg, who speedily settled the trouble by suspending the Kaimma,kam, deporting to Basrah the six leading townsmen of Katif including AH bin Mansur bin Akhwan, the customs farmer, and generally condoning all the outrages committed by the Bedouin. On the 4th September, the Mirolai crossed over to Bahrain to arrange with one of the steamer agents for a transport to convey the expeditionary force back to Basrah, and on the 9th idem he chartered the S.S. Nasen and proceeded in her for this purpose. The Kaimmakam left Katif about the same time for Hasa across the desert. The rapidity with which the Katif trouble was suppressed occasioned considerable surprise in Bahrain, but the Bedouin presumably had expended most of their ammunition, and had contrived to appropriate a considerable quantity of loot including half the date-crop. They had little stomach therefore for real fighting, while the Katifis being refused consideration and being quite unable to carry on the struggle without Turkish assistance were constrained to acquiesce, to obtain immunity when harvesting the remamd of their fruit. The activity of the British naval officers undoubtedly served to limit the extent of the hostilities, and thus lessened in some degree the losses incurred by merchants of Bahrain, many of whose correspondetits Tn Katif have unfortunately been verv seriously crippled from a financial poir «f view. During the latter months of the year reports were occasionallv received of instances of Bedouin insolence in the oasis. No serious breach of the peace has however occurred again. , On the 12th September, the news was received in Bahrain of the 'en M Bombay of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Pasha, who originally96 administration report of the persian gulf political residency Piracies, Political Resident's visit. Visits of Government vessels. Movements ©f the Political Agent. was a resident of Katar, but settled down m Darin on Tarut Island opposite Katif about 30 years ago. This cunning old Arab who was by profession a pearl merchant, had long been a personal friend of Sheikh Esa of Bahrain whom he used formerly to advise in a sense adverse to British interests. He was also intimately connected with Sheikh Jasim bin Thani by marriage. Of late years his influence had waned, and he avoided Bahrain as Tie owed some E/20,000 to one or two Hindu firms in Manama. The customs farm of Hasa, Katif and Ojair for the year commencing 14th March 1908 was re-sold to the Bin Faris Bin Akhwan Syndicate for 10,000 liras, again making a decrease of 3,000 liras on the previous year's price. In April 1908, it was reported that some 31,000 cattle, valued at 125,000 liras had died in Hasa of disease, presumably anthrax. No true piracies were committed during the period under report, though two or three conflicts at sea occurred in connection with the hot-weather struggle between the Bedouin and the settled people of Katif. It was rumoured that Ahmad bin Salman was engaged on the side of the Bedouin, but he is not known ever to have put to sea this year. Maior P Z. Cox, C.I.E., paid his annual visit to Bahrain on the 18th and 19th May 1908 in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. The Chief went out as usual to the steamer to welcome the Resident to his State, after which Major Cox landed at the Agency and received visits from the European community and the leading Muhammadan and Hindu residents. On the following morning the Political Resident called on the Sheikh at his residence m Muharraq and at 2 p.m . he left in the Lawrence for Bushire. The RIMS Lawrence called at Bahrain on the 18th May with the Political Resident on board and left on the following day. She came again on the 17th September to tow the Agency steam launch down to the Bombay dockyard, and returned to Bahrain on the 2nd December with the same vessel in tow, as well as with the Koweit Agency launch. On the 18th December, the Lawrence again visited Bahrain with Mr. C. Akers, deputed by the Board of Trade, and Captain A. P- Trevor, First Assistant Resident, on board. H. M. S. Sphinx paid visits to the port of three days' duration m June and four days in July. On the first occasion Commander Litchfield, R.N., called on the Chief in Muharraq and received a return visit on board the following day, firing a salute of 5 guns as Sheikh Esa left the vessel for the shore. H. M. S. Lapwing spent 26 days in Bahrain and Katif waters during May, June, July and August of which 19 days were in the last named month. H. M. S. Redbreast was 38 days in the same waters between June 22nd and September 5th, her stay of longest duration being 20 days from Augus 13th onwards. , The only foreign man-of-war to visit the port during the year was the French gun boat Surprise, which arrived from K&lt;weit on the 4t h April ^ left for the Trucial Oman Coast two days later The Commander Maxime Banal, exchanged official visits with the Political Agcnt andcanea on the Chief of Bahrain in Muharraq, borrowing the services of the Age y Interpreter for the occasion as the ship carried no Arabic ling uist ; Mon Banal and his wife with two other officers of the ship also drove out to see we tumuli at Ali with the Political Agent on the afternoon of the 5th On the 20th May 1908, the Political Agent proceeded on four days crui to Fuwairat and Lusail on the Katar peninsula in the Agency steam lau • On the 31st May, he paid a flying visit to Bushire in H.

On the 17th October 1908, the Polictical Agent proceeded on' six weeks' » privilege leave to India, at the conclusion of which he was deputed to Poona for 10 days to hand over 20 cases of pottery, bones, etc. excavated from the tumuli at Ali, to the Superintendent of Archgeology' Western Circle, India, and to assist the latter in sorting the contents of the cases. The Agency Head Clerk, Mr. D. X. Lobo, held efficient charge of the current duties of the Political Agency during this period of nine weeks as lie had similarly done in the previous year. On the 3rd April 1908, Mr. R. E. Holland, I.C.S., and Lieutenant™^ C. H. Gabriel, His Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas, landed for a night in Bahrain. other On the 10th April, Mr. W. A. Hirst, late Principal of the Guzerat ^e' 116 ' 8 0£ College, Ahmedabad, who was proceeding to England via Baghdad and Aleppo and collecting material for articles to the newspapers on political and commercial subjects, landed at the Agency for a night. Captain M. F. White, I.M.S., Mobile Assistant Quarantine Officer, paid two brief visits to Bahrain in April and July. On the 25th July, Monsieur V. Rosenthal paid his third annual visit to Bahrain, putting up as before with the Agent of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., and departing for Lingah on the 24th October. He came at a time when money was very scarce in Bahrain and was particularly needed for the continuance of the pearling industry in the height of the diving season. He was therefore enabled to buy a much larger quantity of pearls than ever previously, and is said to have invested 10 or more lakhs of rupees at a most profitable rate. It was estimated, one month after his departure, that M. Rosenthal's purchases were worth at least 5 lakhs more than he had paid for them, and at the present time it seems that their value must have increased nearly 100 per cent. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. were joined in September by a young assistant named Bohnstorf and also received brief visits from the firm's employes Messrs. Brown (of Lingah) and Eisenhut (of Basrah) in August and November respectively. The German Consul from Bushire, Dr. Listemann, also put up with the firm for two short periods in December. The changes amongst the 'personnel of the American Mission have been the departure of the Rev. J. Barny to Maskat in July, and the arrival from the United States of the Rev. J. Moerdyk and G. J. Pennings and Dr. (Miss) T. H. Josselyn, m.d ., in December. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, Political Agent, Bahrain.CHAPTER X. ADMINISTRATION EEPORT FOE KOWEIT FOE THE NIKE MONTHS ENDING 31 ST DECEMBEE 1908. The nine months under review have shown a further decline in the power of the Hail faction and a corresponding consolidation of the power of Abdul Aziz-bin-Sa'ud. The weakening of the Bani Eashid has been due as much to internal family dissensions as to any attacks made on them by the southerners of Neid. . . Early in April, a report reached Koweit that Faisal-bin-Eashid had killed the governor of Jauf, a nominee of the Amir, Sultan-bin-Eashid, and had set up an administration of his own there. In the same month came news that the Sibhan clan of the Shammar tribe with 70 Hail townsmen had escorted Sa'ud-bin-Abdul Aziz-bin-Eashid to Medina. The party were well received by the Turkish authorities who are said to have assisted them in collecting zikat from the Harb tribe. About the same time were reported the deaths of Hamud-bin-Obaid-ar- Eashid and the wife of Abdul Aziz -bin-Eashid, the late Amir. The latter s sister appears to have married Hamud-bin-Sibhan The next news came in May from El Kasim where Abdul Aziz-bin- Sa'ud finally turned out the Amir of Boraida, Muhammad-al-Mahanna, Abal Khail, who was permitted to go into exile at Zubair. The same month brought news of a reconciliation effected between Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud and Sultan-bin-Eashid. In June, news came from Boraida that Sa'ud-bin-Eashid had either killed or imprisoned Sultan-bin-Eashid and his son who had attempted a flight with the family treasure. In September, the _ Sibhan clan of the Shammar tribe, under the leadership of Hamud-bin-Sibhan, attacked and took possession of Hail and installed Sa'ud-bin-Abdul Aziz as Amir Saud- bin-Hamud was killed by them. A pedigree of the house of Obaid-bm- Eashid is attached to this report. The latest news from the interior shows that Abdul Aziz -bm-Sa'ud is in El-Kasim and making extravagant demands on the Sibhan clan which must end either in fresh disturbances or in the unconditional submission o the Shammar faction for the time being. Sheikh Mubarak has just informed the Political Agent that news has come in from Boraida that Bin-Sa'ud, contemplating a raid on Hail, readied a village within two days of that town and found the Sibhan and ohammar m full strength to oppose 'him and had to return to Boraida. There are few events of any consequence to report during the nine months. There were serious disturbances in Al-Katif between Bedouins and townsmen, but events in Al-Hasa hardly fall within the purview ot this Agency. The Ajman Chief, Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, seems to have in creased in power and concurrently the power of Bin-Sa ud s Agen , Aziz-bin-Mashuq, has been steadily on the increase in Al-Hasa. Two Aiman Chiefs, Fahaid-al-Mutalagam, Sheikh of the Al-Hadi section and Abdulah-bin-Mansur-bin-Manaikhir, Sheikh of the Al-Safran sec i the Aiman, raided Faisal-bin-Majid-ud-Dawish during the mon 0 . in the direction of the wells of Ilhaba, one of the wells called A - the tract of As-Suman. ri ^ Sheikh Mubarak directed the return of the camels to Faisal the two Sheikhs, noted above, imprisoned as hostages until the , was complete. These men were imprisoned in the mlddie J ^ V Fahaid-al-Mutalagam was released on the 24th Octobe# and Abduiian-u Manaikhir about the 10th December.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. «/9 An event of some interest occurred in October when the Aiman round Al -Hasa looted a caravan of Siba and Sahul in the neighbourhood of A1 Hafhuf, in spite of the caravan being accompanied by Ajman rafiqs Some restitution was made, but as these were Eiadh ' Araibdar it is expected that Bin -Sa'ud will, in his leisure moments, exact vengeance for the outrage committed against them, m which Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, the Aiman Chief, took a leading part. Umtair politics have been quiet this year. Reports were received in October of a complete reconcilation between Bin-Sa'ud and Faisal-ad- Dawish, the Sheikh of the Elwa. The only other event worth recording in connection with this tribe is the death of Isa'ud-al-Fugam, Sheikh of the large Sab'ha sections of the Elwa Umtair. He died in Koweit on the 20th July of tuberculosis and was succeeded by his brother Haif. The remaining tribe of importance near Koweit is the Thaffir and Thaffir politics have been somewhat disturbed owing to the defection of Mutani-bin-Hallaf, Sheikh of the important sub-division of As-Said. This Chief left the tribe in November and joined* Sa'adun of the Muntafik; Hamud-bin-Swait, the chief of the Thaffir, has now come to Koweit and further developments may be expected shortly. Towards the end of December reports reached the Political Agent that 17 camels, which were grazing to the south-west of Jahra and belonged to his escort and men, were raided and carried off by the Shammar tribesmen. On hearing of this news Sheikh Mubarak at once despatched two of his own men to try and recover the raided animals. No news of their recovery was, however, received till the end of December. Towards the end of April, His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Navy. Chief, East Indies Station, visited the port of Koweit in H. M. S. Hyacinth. On the arrival of the ship, the Political Agent immediately proceeded on board and the usual salute of 11 guns was fired as he approached the ship. For good and sufficient reasons. Sheikh Jabir did not pay the usual visit of welcome. A letter of apology for this neglect was sent by Sheikh Mubarak, who was at Sirra but returned to Koweit immediately. Un-official and social visits were paid that evening and ceremonial visits arranged for the following day. On both occasions, Sheikh Mubarak paid the first visits. The following ships of His Majesty visited Koweit during the period under reportH. M. S. Hyacinth once, H. M. B. Lapwing once, and the R. I. M. S. Lawrence six times. The Political Resident visited Koweit twice during the nine months. visits ai d . . tours of The Political Agent went up to Basrah in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence, British placed at his disposal during the month of July, in connection with Sheikh Mubarak's Fao date plantations, and the alleged encroachments by the Turkish military authorities at Fao. The Political Agent, during his two days' stay at Basrah, visited His Britannic Majesty's Consul and conferred gith him on the subject. He also paid a private visit to His Excellency the Wali of Basrah at his residence and obtained permission to land at Fao and visit the broken embankment regarding which Sheikh Mubarak had made so many complaints. The Political Agent on his return voyage landed at Fao ^ith one of the ship's officers and marched off to the spot and inspected it. While at Fao he visited the Kaimmakam of Fao and the visit was returned by he latter at the Telegraph quarters. The Political Agent then embarked and proceeded to the Khor Abdulla and after having landed at the Wool sJand for a while returned to Koweit on the 21st July. Another tour of a month's duration was undertaken by the Political A gent to the south of Koweit. Towards the end of December, the Political Agent went up to Fao, toiiammerah and Basrah with the Political Resident in the R. I. M. S. uwrence and returned in the Agency steam launch Lewis Pelly. o 2 officials.100 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GtTLP POLITICAL RESIDENCY Customs. Public health. Marine. Agei^y launch. Dioptric light. Pearl fisheries. Arms trade. ie\Ion pearl fisheries. Foreigners. The customs administration has been in the hands of one Abdul Mohsin whose appointment, in January last, was noted in last year's report. There is no indication of customs charges having increased. With the exception of the incident on board S. S. Waroonga, when Abdul Mohsin appears to have behaved in a way that suggests he was acting under instructions, his conduct appears to have been exemplary and the administration of the customs, on the whole, orderly and effective. No special matters of interest, from the point of view of an administra tion report, mark the present nine months. The arms trade has flourished as usual and no attempt is made at concealing the trade. During the month of October, Sheikh Mubarak twice despatched in his steam launch large quantities of arms and ammunition to his friend, Sheikh Khazal. In April, Monsieur Nichan Hernezyan arrived in Koweit from Maskat. It was said that his business was to collect outstandings due to his firm. He collected, it is said, only T£300 and his other customers ran away to Nejd. Mons. Hernezyan wore Arab clothes while in Koweit. Mons. Goguyer of Maskat has recently made attempts again to appoint an Agent at Koweit but, it is said, that the Sheikh has refused permission. The public health has been good. The dispensary was kept open for the benefit of the public and 4,840 patients were treated. The daily attend ance of sick persons averaged 53—67 for the nine months under review. The charge of the dispensary was held, from 1st April to 23rd July, by temporary Assistant Surgeon Dadimast^r who resigned the appointment and left for India on the 24th July. Assistant Surgeon Dadimaster was relieved by temporary Assistant Surgeon Nur Muhammad Eahmatullah in whose charge the dispensary remained till the close of the year. The British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers, slow and fast mails alternately, continue to call here weekly. The fast mails missed the port on five occasions and the slow mails twice. The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company's vessels found an opening for trade in Kbweit owing to the S. S. Waroonga incident. Altogether 11 visits have been paid by this Company's vessels during the nine months under report. No other Company g vessels have made Koweit a port of call. The Agency steam launch Lewis Pelly arrived at Koweit on the 8th December. The dioptric light of the 6th order, supplied by the Government of India for the Koweit anchorage, arrived from England on the 7th May 1908 and was hoisted the very day. It has been a great help to the vessels entering the port, and has given no trouble in the working or management. The pearl fisheries will be more fully treated of in the annual trade report, but, as they are the main industry of Koweit, a brief mention of them here will not be out of place. The catch of pearls appears to have been up to the average but prices were exceptionally low, with the result that the seafar ing population and petty shopkeepers and traders have been very hard put to it. A sudden rise in price about November has sufficed to save the merchants from loss and even to place them in a more favourable position than they were before. One result of the above poverty has been a few applications from pearlers for passes for the Ceylon pearl fisheries. No passes to pearlers have been issued by this Agency but it is reported that about five hundred Koweit pearlers have left for Ceylon in search of work and that more propose to follow. The visit of Mons. Nichan has been recorded under ' Arms trade. A Mr. Guays, who had previously visited Koweit, came again in May and tried to obtain, on behalf of Messrs. Henry Tate &amp; Sons, Limited,AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 101 London, a monopoly of the sugar trade and to make Koweit an entrepot for the sale of English sugar throughout the Persian Gulf. The Sheikh declined to grant any monopoly but said that Mr. Quays was welcome to trade in sugar and secure a monopoly for himself by selling it cheaper and better than other people. The friendship between Koweit and Mohammerah has been flourishing sheikh greatly this year. Sheikh Khazal attended the marriage of the Sheikh's Mubarak's youngest son in the month of May and Sheikh Mubarak has paid frequent SohammeTah visits during the nine months to his friend at Failiya; the last and longest visit took place during October and November and lasted over two months. Special and valuable assistance was afforded during this period to Sheikh Khazal by Sheikh Mubarak in reducing the Hawaiza tribesmen to submission. Their efforts are said to have been completely successful. The Turkish authorities have given Sheikh Mubarak little trouble this gheikh year. There was a talk at the close of last year about the breaking of a bund Mubarak's by Turkish soldiers. The Political Agent visited the spot in July. Nowt^the settlement has yet been arrived at but little has been heard of friction between Tur ^ is J 1 . g the Sheikh and Turkish officials on this account since the Political Agent's aut 01lties ' visit. The only other event that was likely to endanger good relations between Koweit and the Turks was the attempt, made in the close of September, by the sons of the deposed Sheikh of Zubair, Abdullah-bin-Brahim-ar-Rashid, to seize the Sheikhdom of Zubair. This plot was undoubtedly hatched in Koweit and it is said that it received the countenance of the Sheikh's sons, Jabir and Salim. It failed completely and Sheikh Mubarak recently com plained to the Political Agent that his good friend, Sa'adun, had made Sheikh Mubarak's conduct in this affair the subject of a time-serving complaint to the Turkish authorities. ' As a matter of fact,' said Sheikh Mubarak with apparent candour, ' I strongly advised the conspirators not to move until they held in their possession a document signed by the leading men of Zubair to the effect that the population of Zubair desired them as Sheikhs of Zubair.' There is no reason to suppose that Sheikh Mubarak's version of his conduct in the affair is incorrect. Sheikh Mubarak has made extensive purchases of date gardens during the year in Turkish territory and, as this report is being drafted, it has become known and confirmed to the Political Agent by the Sheikh himself that he has just bought from Ahmad-az-Zahair, a large property known as Fadhagiya, an island property on the right bank of the Shat-el-Arab, ad joining the property known as Dawasir, for the sum of about T£60,000. These extensive purchases of river property in Turkish territory go far to prove that Turkish encroachments cannot really be very serious or dreaded by Sheikh Mubarak. At one time during the nine month's, viz., in the months of July and sheikh August, relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent were decidedly strained and very unsatisfactory. The trouble arose over the case of the the Political fight on board the S. S. Waroonga between Persian soldiers and Koweit Agent - subjects, when the Sheikh took umbrage at the tone of the letters addressed to him by the Political Agent asking that severe notice be taken of the offences unjustifiably committed by Koweit subjects. Quarantine, which will be noticed later, was also a sore subject. Lately, however, and especially since the long absence of Sheikh Mubarak at Failiya, matters have changed and relations appear to be now on as friendly a footing and as thoroughly satisfactory as they have ever been. The Political Agent's relations with Jabir and the other members of the Subah family have been quite friendly and remained so throughout and in spite of the cloud that came between the Sheikh and the Political Agent. ) The notable social event of the year was the marriage of Sheikh Muba- _ rak s youngest son, Hamud, to the daughter of his nephew Subah-bin- family Muhammad -bin-Subah. At the same time. Sheikh Mubarak's daughter was affairs, given in marriage to Subah-bin-Muhammad-bin-Subah. These two marriages2Q2 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY were intended to be a mark of the perfect reconciliation that has taken place between the Sheikh and his nephews of the opposite faction. They were celebrated in May with much pomp. Sheikh Khazal of Moham- merah, as mentioned above, come to Koweit, and many of the Basrah notables and merchants were also present. On the 17th of the same month, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Salim was married to a daughter of Sheikh Jabir-bin-Mubarak. It was noticed that the boy's father, Sheikh Salim, though present in Koweit, did not attend any of these festivities. All this marrying and giving in marriage appears to have encouraged Sheikh Jabir-bin-Mubarak to take to himself in marriage a daughter of the sheikhly family of the Bani Arayan of the Bani Khalid tribe. This marriage was celebrated in the end of May. The only blot on the harmony of these proceedings was some severe exactions on the merchants and people of Koweit to pay for these expenses. They had already dutifully presented rich presents to their Sheikh and, in addition, a list was circulated among the petty shopkeepers and merchants by which a sum, estimated at T£30,000, was collected from them. Much dis content was caused by these exactions. The administration of the town shows itself to be as vigorous and orderly as ever, although Koweit has undoubtedly passed through trying times this year, as all classes, and especially the poorer population, were heavily hit by the very low prices ruling in the pearl market until November of this year. Whatever may be said as to his methods. Sheikh Mubarak has the town well in hand and since the exactions recorded in connection with the sheikhly marriages, there have been no complaints of injustice or oppression. He has been equally successful with the desert Bedouins. There have been some rumours of oppressive rates raised against the cultivators on his Fao estates. The incident of S. S. Waroonga, mentioned in previous page, was also the occasion of a serious breach in the friendly relations that have for so long been happily maintained between Sheikh Mubarak and the British India Steam Navigation Company who have done so much for this port. Sheikh Mubarak actually ordered the Agent of the Company to leave the town and to inform the Company that they were to discontinue the visits of their steamers. When it was shown to him by the Political Agent that these orders involved a serious breach of contract and great injustice, he withdrew his orders against the Agent which, the Political Agent told him plainly, would not be obeyed, unless the Sheikh chose to take the responsibility of employing force to compel submission. However, the Sheikh, successfully for some weeks, maintained a boycott against the Company's vessels and called in for a few visits the vessels of the rival Company, the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company. Latterly the British India Steam Navigation Company have lowered their freight rates to Koweit and appears now to be competing successfully with their rivals and harmonious relations between the Sheikh and his old friends are happily restored. Sheikh Khazal's visit has been already recorded. Seyyid Hashim, of the family of the Nakib of Basrah, paid a visit to Koweit in July of this year and it was believed that he has acquired some land from Sheikh Mubarak at the western end of the town where he proposes to build himself a house. He is a man of about 25 years ^ of age wel educated and intelligent. The Political Agent paid him a visit which was duly returned. Sheikh Thari-bin Fahaid-bin Obaid, of the Bani Rashid, has remained in Koweit throughout the nine months under report. The Assistant Surgeon has frequently paid him professional visits, as he is unfortunately an invalid and the relations between him and the Political Agent have been cordial.AND THE MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1908. 103 The last Arab visitor of distinction to Koweit was Ahmad Pasha-az- Zahair, from whose family the Sheikhs of Zubair were formerly selected. He arrived on 23rd December and left again for Basrah the next day. The object of his visit was the sale to Sheikh Mubarak of his date garden property known as Fadhagiya. Many Bedouin Chiefs have visited the Political Agent during the past nine months. The chief visitor was Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, the Ajman Chief, who had not before visited the Political Agent. No decisive steps, with regard to quarantine, have been taken during the Qiarantu. past nine months. Discussions, both verbal and written, on the question have been frequent and occasionally rather bitter. No serious efforts to enforce quarantine have been made by the Sheikh or his servants. The arrival of the steam launch Lewis Pelly affords a simple method of settling the controversy by discontinuing the visits of the fast mail steamers and bringing mails and passengers in whom the British Agency is interested to Koweit from Fao. The matter is under consideration. The charge of the Agency was held by Major S. G. Knox throughout thei nine months under report. S. G. KNOX, Major, Political Agent, Koweit,CONFIDENTIAL. /ST*.

The changes in Arabistan, Bahrain and Kuwait were due to the incum bents of those offices proceeding on furlough after several years tenure of their appointments, viz., Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, Major F. B. Prideaux and Major S. G. Knox, respectively. In connection with these movements, Captain Shakespear was transferred from Bandar Abbas to Kuwait, being relieved in turn by Captain M. E. Rae, then Second Assistant Resident at •Bushire. It will be noted that Kermanshah now drops out of the list of appoint ments under the Residency. This is due to the fact that in the course of joint consideration, by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, of the financing and filling of the Consular appointments in Persia ^d, the Persian Gulf, it was decided to make an exchange between Kerman- . a h, hitherto filled by the Government of India, and Mohammerah, which since the creation of the appointment 18 years ago, had been filled by His ajesty's Foreign Office. Accordingly Captain L. B. Haworth, Consul at ermanshah, became Consul for Arabistan to reside at Mohammerah, while Mr. W. McDouall, hitherto Consul at Mohammerah, was transferred to Ker- j^anshah. Captain Haworth, however, was obliged to apply for sick leave or e taking up his new post, and Lieutenant A. T.

Under the new arrangements the post at Ahwaz now became a Vice-Con sulate in the sphere of the Consul for Arabistan. The incumbent, however, retained the local rank of Consul granted him for the purposes of precedence among foreigners, and, so far as his duties with the Bakhtiaris were con cerned, continued to work directly with His Majesty's Legation, through the Consulate-General at Bushire, or Ispahan, according to season, as heretofore. The dates and details of the changes will be found in the Reports of the offices concerned. The reports from Bushire, Shiraz, Lingah and Bandar Abbas consist almost entirely of narratives of the Bushire and Fars. course of the so-called 'Nationalist' upheaval, which occurred in the Southern provinces in the early part of the year, the aftermath of which continued to make itself felt almost to the close thereof. With regard to this particular topic, the reports from the several are so interdependent on one another that it is simpler to treat them collectively. At the time the last year's report was written, March 1909, it was stated that most of the principal towns in Persia were in the hands of the Nationalists, and that it seemed probable that the Shah would soon be brought to his knees, if only for want of funds. At the commencement of this year, the most prominent actor on the stage was Seyyid Abdul Husein Lari and the scene was laid in Laristan. The Kawami brothers of Shiraz, Salar-i-Sultan (who had succeeded his murdered father as 'Kawam') and Nasr-ed-Dowleh, his younger brother, had left Shiraz in November 1908, determined to extinguish the troublesome religious firebrand above-mentioned, who for a long time past had been neglecting no opportunity to attack and loot the adherents and the property of the Kawam family in the Darab and Fasa districts. Action had been however delayed too long, and the Kawam was unable to move beyond Darab, while Seyyid Abdul Husein maintained himself successfully in Lar. Ultimately their dispositions were no more effective than the usual run of Persian warlike operations, and, after spending a good deal of money and time, they returned to Shiraz, in March, without having effected anything and leaving the dis tricts at the mercy of Seyyid Abdul Husein, whose energies had been greatly stimulated by the failure of the Kawams to tackle him. Meanwhile, remaining in Lar himself, in case of any advance from the north on the part of the Kawamis, the Seyyid had, through the instrument ality of letters of exhortation and the active assistance of two or three kind red spirits, been sedulously disseminating revolutionary propaganda in the Gulf Ports, and, as a direct result of this, disturbances broke out, first at Bandar Abbas, on 17th of March, then at Bushire, on the 22nd, and, finally, at Lingah 3 days later, the Customs and Local Government falling into the hands of the so-called Nationalist leaders. The situation was indeed res cued in a great measure from a state of danger and anarchy by the appoint ment and arrival of His Excellency the Darya Begi as Governor of the Gulf Ports, but it was not until the deportation of Seyyid Murteza, the Bushire leader, in June, and the entry of the Nationalist forces into Tehran in July, resulting in the abdication of Muhammad Ali Shah and the reinception oi constitutional government, that anything like normal conditions were res tored in the ports themselves. For the latter part of the year the centre of political interest lay c Wefly in the local politics of Shiraz, which are graphically described by Mr. 13i / in his report. The opening of the year Shir i had found Shiraz with a hopelessly incompetent Governor-General in the person of Asaf -ed-Dowleh, who seems to have been merely a puppet in the hands of the Kashgai Ilkhani, Sowlet- ed-Dowleh. Asaf-ed-Dowleh was, however, dismissed in July; Zilr -es -Sultan, Ala-ed-Dowleh and Ain-ed-Dowleh being severally nominated in turn o succeed him. None of these choices however proved practicable, and the posPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. W as eventually given to a comparative stranger to Fars politics the Saham- ed -Dowleh, whose appointment the now powerful Sowlet was graciously pleased to approve. This official appears to have been of a type unfor tunately a very ram avis m Persia hitherto. Had he received reasonable assistance from the Central Government in the direction of financial and practical support, it is conceivable that he might have been able to effect an entire change in the situation in Fars. Without these aids his regime, in spite of his strong personality, was doomed to succumb to the forces of fac- tion -intrigue and corruption by which he was beset. Apart from the above, the salient points to which I would draw atten tion in the Shiraz Report, are : {%) the despatch from Bushire of a small mixed detachment of 50 men under the Second Assistant Resident, Lieuten ant J. S. Crosthwaite, and Lieutenant George Lang, R.N., in July 1909, to strengthen the escort of the Consulate, on which there were some grounds to expect attack. This party was subjected to discourteous treatment by the Shaikh of Borasjun, who, on their arrival at midnight, refused them the hospitality of his caravanserai. There is reason however to think that the incident was partly due to avoidable misunderstanding, and the Governor- General at Shiraz has undertaken that reparation is made on the detach ment's return-journey : {ii) the attack made on the caravan of the Russian Consul-General, apparently by Kuhgelu raiders and (m) the rise of the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Ilkhani of the Kashgais, to a position from which he was able practically to dictate the policy of the Persian Government in Fars and to make it impossible for any Governor-General, not palatable to him, to retain his position. Apart from Fars politics, which have been sufficiently dealt with above, „ ' I need only mention {%) the revision of .Bandar Abbas. ^ . • T , • the status and jurisdiction of our ap pointment at Bandar Abbas, owing to altered political conditions, and, (ii) to the promotion of the Telegraph Office at that port, hitherto run only as a departmental station, to the status of an International Office. It is hoped that in the course of time the present high scale of charges will admit of some reduction. The province of Kerman, though not immune from the general conditions Kerman of anarchy which prevailed, had little direct participation in the outburst of revolution or ' nationalism ' (if this euphemism is preferred) which so con vulsed Fars. It will be seen, however, that Persian Baluchistan was practically out of control all through the year. On the 11th of July, Major Ducat tele graphed that, in the event of the forces of the allied Baluchi ChiefSj then on the war-path, reaching Bam, Kerman would certainly be taken by the Afshars, and the situation would then be one of great danger. Under in structions from the Minister, His Majesty's Consuls at Kerm'an and Seistan sent warnings to the Chiefs that they would be held responsible by the British Government for any loss to British subjects resulting from their proceedings, and at the same time the Resident telegraphed to Sardar Seyyid Khan of Gaih warning him against further aggressive action. These mess es apparently had their effect, and nothing more was heard of the Baluchi advance. The wholesale migration of indigent Mekranis, reported from the Jask _ District, is a serious difficulty for which The Persian Mekran Coast. it is hard to devise any p rac ticable reniedy. During the present year it will be seen that some 1,200 souls were driven by the pressure of famine conditions to migrate to the Oman Coast. I acre, the greater part of them either sell themselves or otherwise lapse into a condition of slavery. Their plight however only becomes apparent when perhaps they have earned a little money and are anxious to return to their country; then their protectors or masters, as the case may be, intervene and prevent their departure. Thus, at some of the Arab Coast ports, I haveADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF found communities of these Mekranis living m apparent contentment in separate ' quarters outside the Arab villages, engaged in service but not in a state of slavery; while other individuals belonging to the same families may meanwhile be slaves in local Arab families on the same terms as any neoro slave. In these cases their more fortunate relatives are either too apathetic or in too weak a position to do anything for them. The fact, I fear, is that they are all in such a low state of civilisation, that they do not sufficiently appreciate the difference between the conditions of slavery and freedom; and after all they are probably happier, living in comparatively well-fed servitude in Oman, than they would be fighting against starvation in their own country. The case of Mir Barkat is touched upon also in the Bushire Report. It is unfortunate that in such cases as this, of the deportation of Mekranis who give us trouble in connection with the Arms Traffic, strict international comity obliges us to allow the Persian authorities to deal with them instead of our keeping them in custody ourselves, the fact being that no prisons or regular arrangements exist for the lengthy safe custody of prisoners with the Persian authorities, and that their upkeep in practice falls upon the personal pocket of the local Governor. The running of arms all along the Mekran Coast continued, as oppor tunities offered, up to the end of the year, soon after which the inception of effective blockade operations put a different complexion on our measures for the suppression of the traffic. Full details of the progress of the traffic are given in the Maskat Report. This is the first Administration Report that the Government of India have received from Mohammerah, this Arabistan. being in pursuance of the transfer of that appointment to the Government of India in exchange for Kermanshah. Lieutenant Wilson, on behalf of the Government of India, has gone very exhaustively into all questions connected with his charge; the result is a considerable increase of our local knowledge. Except in so far as the Shaikh himself, as Ruler of Southern Arabistan, is necessarily dragged into the national question of the hour and its indirect bearing on his relations with the Bakhtiaris, his territory has remained immune from the pestilence of anarchy which has so much disturbed the other parts of Persia, and has been 'practically unaffected by it. The Shaikh him self, however, has several times during the year been simultaneously appealed to by leaders both of the National and Reactionary parties and has found himself in a great dilemma as to which side of the hedge to descend, it being difficult to get down on both sides at once, as he would prefer to do. In this doubt he has repeatedly begged for the specific advice and guidance of the British Government, but this it has naturally been difficult or impossible to give, and the Shaikh has had to rely (and has relied) on such general assur ances as we have been able to give him. On the whole he has played his cards well, considering the undoubted difficulties of his position. I would specially mention his satisfactory attitude as regards his Customs. The branches at Bandar Abbas, Lingah and Bushire, had all fallen into the hands of the Nationalist leaders : the personnel of the Department were in a state of panic, and the Shaikh was being vigorously exhorted by the Nationalist leaders and by the Priests of Messopotamia to resume the Customs from the Belgian administration. In view of the past, it is difficult to imagine any thing that would have been more palatable to him than to do this, but he had the good sense to be guided by our advice to maintain a neutral attitude, confining his action to instructing the Belgian Director to retain the receipts at Mohammerah for the present until the situation in Tehran should clear. The agreement with the Oil Company and the inception of their por tentous enterprise in Arabistan have been among the most pregnant events o . the year. The Shaikh was, on the whole, very reasonable in his dealings with the Company, and gave them far better terms than they had obtaine from the Bakhtiaris.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. The question of the Karun Irrigation was revived at the beginning of Karun irrigation. yGar in a somewhat incoDvenient . . • x i form. News reached His Minister, in January that the Dutch Minister, Monsieur de Sturler, then on furlough, had obtained a two years option in which to arrange for the a^uis! Trn„frv% C 0th Oe \To n 9 T e be P p 0ltatl0n p at AhwaZ ' the commencing^from January 10th, 1909. The Persian Government were warned that, in view of the communications which had passed on the subject of the Karun Irriga tion the British Government reserved its right to object to the scheme if found prejudicial to British interests. The Shaikh of Mohammerah heard of the concession in an exaggerated form about the same time, and took con siderable alarm. He was dissuaded from telegraphing to the Persian Govern ment, but claimed the right of option for himself, and asked for guarantees from us that his claims and rights would not be ignored. The Netherlands Minister made much of the ' vague character ' of the concession and assured Sir George Barclay that the Netherlands Government would give the Syndicate timely warning that no work would be undertaken without the co-operation of the Shaikh and the support of His Maiestv's Government. J J Shaikh Khazal's fears were, in a great measure, allayed on receipt of this news, and no further developments were reported up to the end of the year. It was interesting to learn in this connection that it was the expert opinion of Sir William Willcocks that irrigation from the Karun could be deterred with advantage for some years to come. He advocated the com mencement of irrigation rather from the Karkha, and a satisfactory exami nation of the locality was accordingly carried out under his advice, and a scheme prepared, for inception on a suitable opportunity presenting itself. It will be noted that a most regrettable rupture took place between bnaikh Khazal and his nephew Hanzal, in connection with which the former seemed inclined tp act with haste and severity, but better counsels to some extent prevailed in the end, and it is to be hoped that the lapse of time will ultimately reconcile uncle and nephew; failing which, it is difficult to foresee whither their mutual resentment may not land them. Shaikh Khazal on the whole maintained cordial relations with the Turkish authorities at Basrah during the year; but at one stage of the Nation alist crisis, he was a good deal perturbed by the receipt of reports pointing to an intention on the part of the Turks to violate the frontier from the Bagh dad direction. As a Warden of the Marches, his responsibility to the Central government in regard to his frontier is a heavy one, and yet the Ministry, if indeed any existed at the time, paid no attention to his requests for instruc tions or advice. Again he had to rely on such general assurances as the British Government could give him. The question of the Turco-Persian Frontier, bounding Mohammerah -n . „ i . territory, received the close attention of iurco-Persian Frontier. tt- n/r • ^ 5 His Majestys Government at this time, a nd both the general position between Turkey and Persia, and our position ln r eg ar d to both, have been considerably cleared by the correspondence wmch passed on the subject. Under present conditions, the spheres of the functions of Consular posts Ahw at Mohammerah and Ahwaz have, to w ^ z ' some extent, overlapped, but when the Permanent incumbent takes over the senior appointment, measures will be evised for a more effective separation of them. Eote^^ Allowing points in Lieutenant Banking's present report deserve W the satisfactory improvement in the attitude of the Bakhtiaris towards the Oil Company:6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP (ii) the acquisitiion by the Dutch Syndicate above referred to of an option, obtained from the Persian Government, for an exten sive irrigation project from the Karun River. In view of the firm attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government towards the scheme, there are good grounds to hope that we shall not be seriously troubled by the activities of the Syndicate: {Hi) though no tangible result has yet been noticed from the visit of the German Vice-Consul at Bushire, to Arabistan, for the pur pose of making a report on the oil industry, Herr Wassmuss's excursion affords interesting evidence of the readiness of Ger many to concern herself with all questions of commercial deve lopment in the region of the Persian Gulf. Turning to Tribal politics, I would mention the breach which has occur red between the Wall of Pusht -i-Kuh and his son, Amanullah Khan, which may have important results upon the politics of Luristan and North Arabi- stan. . i i n Finally, I would allude to the interesting and valuable tour accom plished by His Majesty's Consul in the Kuhgelu country. It is a satisfactory step to have broken the ice with this tribe, and to have made the acquain tance with some other tribal elders. ^ The internal affairs of Oman call for Maskat • no special comment. As regards the burning question of the arms traffic to Mekran, it is satisfactory at any rate to find that there has been considerable diminution in the imports into Maskat during the year ; but it is noted that the German steamers are now credited with slightly more than half the sea-borne traffic. With 27 thousand and odd rifles exported to Mekran, and other large quanti ties believed to have gone to Katr, Kuwait, Bahrain and Persian ports, it is clear how comparatively exiguous are the genuine requirements of Oman itself. It is encouraging to learn at the end of the year that measures for a fully effective blockade are to commence with the new year; and, in the meanwhile, it is to be hoped that the French Government, when they realise that we are in the position to kill the trade if we so have the mind, will find it worth while to come to reasonable terms. The protracted continuance of the present conditions cannot fail to have a most demoralizing effect oh His Highness the Sultan and his relations with us. The ' Kadra ' Dhow incident related by Mr. Holland was an unfor tunate one. The Italian Government appear to have acted in regard to it with no little arbitrariness and severity, and if they prove disposed to main tain their present attitude. His Majesty's Government is likely to experience a good deal of trouble in getting the case settled in a way satisfactory to His Highness. The inception of the new hospital is a matter for much congratulation, and the readiness with which local subscriptions were forthcoming^ and the liberal scale of them, must be attributed to the zeal and good influence brought to bear by Mr. Holland in promoting the project. The pearling season was a prosperous one, the year passed without any „ . , ^ dissensions to speak of among the rucia oast - Trucial Chiefs. The aged Chief of Abu Thabi died on the 19th of May, and was succeeded by his second son Tahnoon bin Zaid, whose succession was recognised in due course by the Government of India. The Abu Musa Oxide dispute with the German Government was in a state of suspension during the year, pending the receipt by His Majesty's Government of the German reply to our arguments of July 1908. This reply is understood to have been received in London at the end of December. Major Prideaux relinquished the Bahrain Agency on his departure on furlough in May after holding the appointment for 4| years. Under his firm control the British position in Bahrain has been greatly improved and consolidated. It remains for his successor to maintain the position which he has acquired for ;the British Eepresentative.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. ^ As elsewhere on the Arab Coast, the pearling season was a profitable one, and enabled unfortunate sufferers from the hard times of the past two years to rehabilitate themselves. K The chief items of general interest on the Bahrain record for 1909 are;— (i) The Shaikh's formal request to the British Government that they will relieve him of jurisdiction over foreigners. ( m ) The endeavour of the Turks to annex the Island of Zakhnuniyah Bahrain, situated close to the coast some ten miles south of Ojair, which point we regard as the southern limit of Tur kish jurisdiction. Representations were made to the Porte by His Majesty's Ambassador, and they assured His Excellency that orders had been issued ' for the withdrawal of the small military post which had been sent to the Island : but, as usual m these cases, there was a good deal of discrepancy between the orders so issued from Constantinople and the manner of their interpretation by the local Turkish authorities here However, in November 1909, the soldiers left of their own accord and had not returned up to the end of the year. (m) The new Persian regime, having continued to argue the question of the sovereignty of Bahrain with His Majesty's Minister, were informed again by Sir George Barclay that the island and its inhabitants were considered to be under British protection, and that His Majesty's Government would be guided entirely by their own views of the position, should any action of the Persian authorities make representations necessary. {it) The enhancement of Shaikh Esa's salute as a personal distinction from 5 to 11 guns, and the grant of a salute of 3 guns to his eldest son, which the Government of India were pleased to sanc tion, gave great satisfaction to Shaikh Esa. Kuwait Here again the successful pearling season and the good market prevailing, made the year a prosperous one. The record of events in the hijrterland calls for no special comment. The proceedings of the A1 Bu Ainain tribe however in migrating from Wakra and settling at Kasr-as-Sabaih, which Shaikh Mobarak claims to be within his jurisdiction, is a matter of some little significance; as the tribesmen appear to have approached the Turkish authorities at Basrah also, and may give the latter an opening for meddling in the locality in question. The colony will need watching on this account. The Shaikh's relations with the Basrah authorities were, on the whole, satisfactory. At the beginning of the year, the Wali was troubling him in connection with the registration of his property at Fadaghia, but he came to an understanding with his adversary for the tdme being, and representations on our part were made superfluous. r j-^ e ^ a ikh received two substantial favours from the Government of India in the shape of the gift of two saluting guns, the enhancement of his personal salute to 12 guns, and the accord of a salute of 5 guns to his eldest son, of all of which compliments he was appreciative. . regards the import of arms, Shaikh Mobarak's attitude has not been satisfactory, but has improved a good deal since Captain Shakespear's report was written. There can be no doubt that a regular supply of arms reaches ^uwait and is sold in the bazaar : on the other hand, these particular arms not find their way, at present at all events, to quarters inconvenient to us, e ing sent mainly to Arabistan and the coast north of Bushire. It is at any r ate a matter of satisfaction that Shaikh Mobarak has maintained his former attitude in refusing to allow Goguyer to start business in Kuwait. P. .Z. COX, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR BUSHIRE AND FARS FOR THE YEAR 1909. (a) Governor. —His Excellency the Moazziz-ed-Dowleh (see last year's report) who, shortly after his arrival, in Changes among Persian officials. October 1908, had proceeded to Mekran and remained in retirement at Charbar, apparently with the idea of evading the cares of government, did not return to his head-quarters until the 25th of March. He then appeared not to realise the developments which had super vened at Bushire during his absence, as he landed without precautions, and was promptly placed under arrest in a private dwelling in the town, by Seyyid Murteza's orders. This course was said to have been taken both in order to keep the Moazziz out of mischief, and with the idea that the fact of his being in custody would serve as a guarantee for the good behaviour of his brother, His Excellency the Asaf-ed-Dowleh, Governor-General of Shiraz. A few days later, having suspicions of the Seyyid's intentions towards him, the Moazziz came into bast at the British Residency, and remained there until assurances were received from the Seyyid that he would be permitted to depart in peace to Shiraz. His Excellency did so, and reached Tehran in safety, but later in the year news was received of his death in the Capital. On 10th May, His Excellency the Darya Begi returned once more and was received with acclamation by the same populace who a few months before had been equally ready to say good bye to him. He was now hailed however as the one man likely to be able to restore Bushire to its normal condition. His Excellency had a fair measure of success and remained as Governor until the end of the year. (5) Karguzar. —After the departure of the Masud-es-Sultan, chronicled in the last year's report, Bushire was left without a Foreign Office Agent for a period of seven months. The new incumbent, Itt^la-jxi-Dowleh, arrived in February 1909. This official appears to have an unsavoury record, but for merly, as Karguzar at Mohammerah, he had been apparently friendly to British interests, and this was also the case when he represented the Persian Foreign Office at the Baluchistan Frontier Meeting of 1907 for the settlement of the border claims. He had since been for a tiifle Karguzar at Kerman; and subsequently took to journalism, conducting a newspaper called the ' Ispahan ' until he received his present post. He is a person of extravagant habits and generally out at elbows, and was a good deal under obliigation oi the Residency for friendly help dn the past or substantial recognition tor co-operation rendered : consequently his appointment as Karguzar was not regarded with disfavour. He remained in office until close upon the end of the year during which time he gave a good deal of assistance in the sett e- ment of British commercial cases. Unfortunately, however, he came to log gerheads with the German Consulate in connection with a question ot cere monial, and also over a certain commercial claim in which the interests o Messrs. Wonckhaus and two or three British firms were concerned, m Karguzar's treatment of the case was satisfactory from the British point o view, but the German firm and Consulate considered that their interests na been ignored, and made vigorous complaints, through the German Le g^ t1011 ' regarding the Ittela-id-Dowleh's attitude, both in respect of the of ceremony and this commercial claim. They were unable to etiect tne ^ guzar's transfer directly, but unfortunately his relations wlth ^ he ^ ar ^ a r ^ n were unsatisfactory, and this reason was made a pretext by tne ^ Foreign Office for getting him transferred to Mohammerah. He was re[ wttu by Mirza Ghulam Ali Khan, Saad-es-Sultan, from Mohammerah, who give promise of being a satisfactory official, as things go in Persia. . (c) Customs. —Monsieur Stas (who gave us trouble at 1906, in connection with the landing of the cable) was in charge of theADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 9 Directorate at the beginning of the year but left for Europe during the second week of January on the termination of his contract with the Persian Government. He is understood not to intend to re-engage. His successor, Monsieur Zwinne, a recent arrival from Belgium, is a well-meaning official but, as has been our experience of all new Belgian hands, showed himself inclined to be ultra punctilious in the enforcement of the letter of the law without due consideration of the particular circumstances of each case. Monsieur Zwinne had a difficult time and some humiliating experiences (which he bore with creditable detachment) during the Seyyid Murteza's troubles, being in the first place expelled from the Customs and subsequently, in the interests of the Administration, coming to terms with Seyyid Murteza and agreeing to super vise the Customs work on certain constitutional conditions. On the 27th of April Monsieur Zwinne informed the Residency that his superior, Monsieur Leleux, who had recently arrived from Mohammerah, had taken over from him the charge of the Customs. As the political position was somewhat nebulous at the time, and as it was doubted whether the National party in power would regard Monslieur Leleux's advent favourably, Monsieur Zwinne was asked whether Monsieur Leleux had come to any written agreement or understand ing with the local Anjuman recognising his assumption of the Directorate. A satisfactory reply was received. Monsieur Leleux brought with him from Mohammerah a reputation for taking a very strict view of his regulations and responsibilities, but he certainly belied it during his term of office at Bushire, and proved conciliatory and reasonable in his official dealings with the Resi dency. He remained in charge until the end of the year. Monsieur Kadloubousky, Vice-Consul in charge of the Russian Con- F . r , sulate-General, for whose co-operation oieign onsu s. during the Seyyid Murteza's disturbances His Majesty's Consul-General had reason to be grateful, left as soon as the situation cleared, for Shiraz to join his Chief, Monsieur Passek. On the 12th of June he telegraphed to the Resident, from Kazerun, informing him that his caravan had been fired on; one of his Cossacks hit in the mouth, and his own horse shot just behind the saddle, the bullet just missing his leg. Monsieur Kadloubousky reached Shiraz without further incident and remained there till the end of the year. An attempt was indeed made by Monsieur Passek and himself to return to the coast towards the end of November, but their caravan was attacked near Khan-i-Zinian, on the 25th November (a Cossack of his escort being killed), and the party at once returned to Shiraz. Dr. Listemann proceeded on leave, on the 20th of April, and was relieved by Herr Wassmuss from Zanzibar, a young man without previous experience of Persia or its language. He arrived at an exceedingly difficult juncture, and being entirely dependent upon his Mirza for local information, was worked upon by the latter, an unscrupulous intriguer, to take up an attitude calculated to give difficulty to the Residency, at an anxious time when, practi cally speaking, the interests and personal safety of all foreigners in Bushire was dependent upon the policy of the British Government and its Represen tative. There was no moral doubt that the German Dragoman, very pro bably for his own delectation, and without the knowledge or instructions of his new Chief, was in close intercourse with Seyyid Murteza throughout, and assisted him with advice and drafts of letters, when in correspondence with the Residency. Herr Wassmuss was, on more than one occasion, given a friendly hint not to rely alone upon the reports of his Mirza in regard to local politics, but he not unnaturally replied that he placed the fullest confi dence in his subordinate, and was satisfied that he was keeping absolutely clear of local faction intrigues. Similarly, Herr Wassmuss was badly advised by the same individual in his quarrels with the Karguzar. With the return of the Bushire situation to normal however, and the expulsion of Seyyid Murteza, the atmosphere cleared, and Herr Wassmuss's last few months in Bushire were undisturbed by any elements of friction. He was still in charge at the close of the year. Monsieur R. Chaloin continued to hold the post of French Vice-Consul until November when he was removed for certain irregularities, and French interests were then, for the time being, consigned to the care of the British10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP Consulate-General, Major Trevor taking over charge from Monsieur Chaloin on his departure. A successor had not been appointed when the year closed. Monsieur Chaloin had so far been a satisfactory colleague in that he took no interest or part in Bushire or Gulf politics; depended mainly on the friendly offices of the Residency for his information, and his co-operation could be relied upon when needed. He did not, however, give satisfaction to his own Government. The honorary duties of this Consulate remained in the hands of the Messrs. Wonckhaus's Agent throughout the year. The grounds for the Nor wegian Consulate at Bushire are not apparent, and the post is a complete sinecure. Turkish interests at Bushire have, for many years, been in the hands of a local Persian gentleman by name Mulla Husein. Towards the end of the year, however, the Porte decided to send a Consul de carriere to Bushire in the person of Nebil Zia Bey, who is apparently expected to remain some time, and has brought his family from Turkey. He has not been in the East before and seems discontented with his lot. Doctor Abel Combier arrived at the beginning of 1909 to replace Dr. Bussiere. He is an officer in the Military Colonial Medical Service, and has maintained cordial relations with the Residency since his arrival. The year 1909 will be long remembered for the Nationalist upheaval which supervened throughout Persia, Local Politics. an( j finally terminated in the deposition or abdication of His Majesty Muhammad AIL Shah, ^ in July 1909, and the re-inception of an administration on Constitutional lines, with a boy of ten summers as a figure-head Shah, under the guidance of a Regent chosen by the representatives of the people. Before narrating the part played by Pars and Bushire in these events, it is necessary to explain briefly the general situation which prevailed in Persia at the beginning of the year. The conflict between the forces of liberalism and re-action had been seething for months in Northern Persia; the Nationalists had now got the upper hand in Tabriz, there had been an abortive rising at Meshed; and Muhammad Ali Shah must surely have come to realise that all serious hope of being able to stem the tide of popular feeling, and to effect reversion to despo tic government was past. He still, however, maintained an attitude of dogged obstinacy, and, apparently hoping that the position might ultimately be saved by Russian intervention, contiinued to burk, by every sort of subter fuge, the promised electoral order necessary for the formation of a new Medjliss. Yet, except at Tabriz, the exasperation of the people had not been expressed by any overt act of revolutionary hostility. Early dn January, however, disturbances broke out in Ispahan; Yezd and Resht followed suit early in Pebruary, and then Pars and the Gulf ports took up the cue. The peasant population of Pars, as a whole, is essentially bucolic and uncivilized. There is no 'nationalist spirit' properly so-caJlled, abroad among the peasantry at large, but the Nationalist propaganda, preached as it was with a strong admixture of religious exhortation, naturally appeals to the more truculent element of the country-side, so long at any rate, as tne main feature of the creed continues to be the non-payment of the taxes and the chance of enrichment by brigandage in some form or spoliation of govern ment Customs. So it was in this case. The movement in the south was started by a fanatical Mulla of Lar, named Seyyid Abdul Husein. In 1907, when affairs in Shiraz were giving trouble to the Government, this firebrand proceeded to the head-quarters the province and endeavoured to upset authority there. On the arnva the Zil-es-Sultan however he made himself scarce but continued to roa about the Darab and Pasa districts with a force of tufangchis, preying up * the properties of his enemies in Shiraz, such as the sons of the Kawam, keeping the country in a general state of unrest and lawlessness.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. ^ It was not until January 1909 that he began to endeavour to subvert constituted aut ^ orit y ^ , i he Gu l f p orts themselves by addressing exhorta tions to the local Mullahs in Bandar Abbas and Lingah, calling on the people to combine, drive out the Belgians and seize the Customs for themselves. Except for the Lan element m the population, no party in Bandar Abbas favoured any disturbances in the port, but the fulminations of the Sevvid calling upon the patriotic to gird up their loins and seize the Customs receipts found their echo among the lawless spirits of the hinterland, and a raid on the port of Bandar Abbas became imminently apprehended. The despatch of one of His Majesty s ships to Bandar Abbas delayed matters temporarilv Unfortunately however, the Governor of the Gulf Ports at the moment was a negative quantity, the Moazziz-ed-Dowleh, an amiable opium-smokino , Shahsevend nonentity, without any experience of the south or capacity to cope with the difficult situation which confronted him on his assumption of the appointment m the preceding October. Like many of his predecessors he got round the diniculty by placing himself out of practical communicat|ion proceeding to Charbar and slitting there idle in camp for many weeks in spite of repeated exhorta^ons to return. He did not in fact get back until the middle 01 March when the situation had long since passed out of control. Matters came to a head at Bandar Abbas, on 17th March, when the Nationalists seized the Customs and assumed charge of the government of the place. We were fortunate in having, in the Misbah-i-Diwan, whom they elected as their Constitutional Governor, a man of some strength of character who did his utmost to preserve order. Lingah followed the example of Bandar Abbas as soon as the news of the assumption of the Customs reached there, and it was realised that Bushire would no longer hold out. As regards Bushire, it will be understood that practically the entire population is engaged in trade with India and Europe. They have, as a community, no really decided democratic ideas; all they ask for is a reason ably just Governor who will maintain order and allow them to follow their trading avocations in peace. There as none of that patriotic fervour amongst them which has evinced itself in Tabriz and elsewhere in the north. ^ m n In ^ us ^ re tile movement was engineered entirely by a Tangistani Mullah named Seyyid Murteza Ahrami, belonging to the village of Ahram some 30 miles from Bushire, who had been in Bushire on and off for the pre ceding 2 or 3 years.^ This individual, acting partly under instructions from oeyym Abdul Husein of Lar, and partly at the direct bidding of the Ulema (oniah High Priests) of Nejef (who realised when it was too late that they ad misplaced their confidence), had an easy task owing to the absence of the overnor and the fact that the two hundred Ispahani Sarbazes on garrison ^ Bushire could be depended upon to offer no resistance. He called in a number of armed peasants from his village of Ahram and elsewhere in the fd all&lt; ^ their assistance assumed control of the post ostensibly on behalf of the nationalist cause, on 22nd March. The following day he seized the Customs House, the Belgian officials withdrawing. It may be mentioned here that the Customs of the Gulf Ports are pled ged to the British Government to the following extent:— (i) The Customs of the Ports generally, as a security for a loan of £300,000 made to the Shah several years ago. (ii) The present Customs receipts at Bushire up to 30,000 tomans per month are specifically pledged at present to the Imperial Bank of Persia in payment of interest on advances and over drafts taken by the Shah and his Ministers. Jhe Resident was directed to explain the position to the Nationalist leaders toT t0 vfy ^ lat ' as ^ ea( ^ ers i 11nor th had recognised and continued iquidate Russian claims there, so in the south we expected that the popu- r P ar ty would respect our claims here, re ^ Bandar Abbas the leaders took a perfectly reasonable attitude in this gard, but in Bushire, in spite of specific directions received from the High12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP Priests of Nejef and Tehran to the effect that the British claims were in order and must be recognised, Seyyid Mnrteza appears to have been mainly intent upon the spoilation of the Customs and the division of the spoil be tween himself and his rabble of tufangchis. From 23rd March to 10th April, when security was restored by the land ing of a British force, Seyyid Murteza, after causing the Customs safe to be forcibly broken open, on 22nd March, disposed of close upon the whole of the nett receipts, namely, about 20,000 tomans. The Seyyid, who was assisted in all these doings by certain confederates (1) Agha Mustapha Nawab, a petty local merchant of evil reputation who is a claimant for British protection but whom the Residency refuses to recog^ nise, and (2) Mirza Ali Kazeruni, also a petty merchant of shady character, indebted to British and other merchants for some 13,000 tomans; and, it was believed, sub rosa, by (iii) Mirza Husein, Dragoman of the German Consulate. The Seyyid himself is a Mullah with no knowledge whatever of affairs of finance, and in all matters financial the above individuals acted severally or jointly as his advisers and collaborators. Naturaljy, as soon as it was noised abroad that the Customs receipts were being appropriated by Seyyid Murteza and his tufangchis, the cupidity of the whole country-side became excited and all the more turbulent characters from the neighbouring villages of Tangistan and Dashti began trooping in to Bushire, many at the specific bidding of the Seyyid and others on their own account. According to his own estimate the Seyyid assessed the num bers for which he professed to need to draw a daily wage from the Customs, at 3,000 men. It was never really as many as this, but at one time it was believed to be anything between 1,000 and 1,500. It will be realised what a menace the presence of these disorderly rustics, all armed with modern rifles, became to public security in the town and the Island of Bushire. They soon got altogether out of Seyyid Murteza's control and the latter, when any urgent situation arose, forthwith repudiated responsibility, while there was no one else able or willing to maintain order or guarantee the safety of the lives and property of British subjects. At nights Bushire town became a perfect pandemonium of rifle firing. No one slept, the populace seemed all to be on guard on the tops of their houses, firing promiscuously into the air or over the roofs of their houses. Moreover many of these gangs of tufangchis who thus found themselves cheek by jowl in Bushire, bent on the common object of plunder or appro priation of Customs revenues, had current blood-feuds w T ith one another in their villages, which they were inclined to pursue here. Quarrels were continually occurring between parties of them, and the situation soon again became so menacing that, with a view of assuring the safety of foreign as well as British subjects, M. M. S. ' Fox ' received instructions to move up to Bushire from Bandar Abbas where the situation had now much improved. The ' Fox ' arrived on 2nd April and remained at the outer anchorage. Meanwhile, things went from bad to worse on shore; the tufangchis increased in numbers and got more and more truculent and out of hand and, on the 8th, two parties of them, finding that, owing to a paucity of Customs receipts, there was no pay left for themselves, forthwith raided the food bazaar just before sunset, and, during the ensuing night, numerous robberies were committed including a considerable amount of merchandise and piece- goods. The Seyyid now admitted his inability to control the men that he had brought in, and even asked the Resident's co-operation in inducing them to leave. The town was by this time in a state of panic. In the course of the 9th, the Russian, German and Turkish Representa tives called at the Residency to consult the Resident, and to urge upon him the necessity for the taking, of some definite measures to provide security. Almost the whole of the British mercantile community did the same. Itpolitical residency for 1909. 13 became evident that the landing of some men from the ship was the only course which would meet the situation, but it was desired to avoid this if possible and to that end, on the evening of the 9th, with the sanction of His Majesty's Legation, the Resident issued an ultimatum to Seyyid Murteza warning him that if the tufangchis were not cleared off the Island by 5 p m next evening, men and guns would be landed to provide security for British and foreign subjects. A few of the tufangchis seemed to clear out of the town itself that night but only to lurk about on the island; quarrelling among themselves and preying upon the inhabitante of the suburbs, a still more dangerous state of things for the Europeans living outside. On the morning of 10th a fracas took place on the portion of the high road used by most of the European merchants on their way to and from town. One man was killed and another wounded and a blood-feud at once started, and, on proceeding to the locality in the morning, the E-esident found about 120 men congregated discussing retaliatory action. During the day there was no serious change. Seyyid Murteza again repudiated responsibility for security, the town was still full of tufangchis and the bazaars remained closed and the people remained awake all night, afraid to sleep. At 4 p.m . a proclamation was published by the British Resident explain ing the position to the public, intimating that bluejackets would now be landed; that the measure had been forced upon the British authorities, by the entire absence of any authority and the danger to British and Foreign lives which the present state of things involved; but that they were only landed to protect life and would be withdrawn as soon as the situation returned to normal. At 5 p.m . no serious reply to the ultimatum of the evening before having been received, 100 men from the ' Fox ' were landed with 4 Maxim guns. Fifty were accommodated in the British Residency premises on the south of the town and fifty lodged in commodious premises of the Customs on the north side next door to the Imperial Bank and the premises of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. The mere fact of the landing of these men in itself restored tranquillity in a great measure, but before they were landed the Resident communicated with the other Foreign Representatives and Euro peans, informing them that, in the event of the bluejackets being landed, he would be able to provide sepoy guards for Europeans who might need them and asking their wishes. The Russian Consulate-General has its own guard of Cossacks, and Monsieur Kadloubousky only needed arrangements to be made for the house of Monsieur Mishtolt, Agent of the Russian Line. A small guard of 4 men was sent to the French Vice-Consulate, which has ordinarily only a guard of Persian Sarhazes, and a strong guard of 10 men to the premises of Messrs. Wonckhaus, at Dr. Listemann's desire, as, apart from the fact that the firm's house is in town close to the Customs—always likely to be a centre of dis turbance in these cases—the firm had at the time a quantity of kerosine oil and piece-goods stored in the premises, which was in itself a somewhat danger ous incubus. The following day, however, this guard was taken off in communication with Dr. Listemann as it was thought that the bluejackets on guard at the Customs House could simultaneously take charge of Messrs. Wonckhaus s premises. » From 11th April till 10th May the town and island remained outwardly peaceful owing to the presence of the men on shore, and the townspeople gradually gained confidence and partially opened their shops, but the leaders of the community meanwhile continued to intrigue and quarrel among them selves, Seyyid Murteza being the whole disturbing element. On the one hand the mercantile portion of the Persian community were not strong enough to ignore or seriously oppose him; on the other hand, they could not bring them selves to work with him, so long as he refused to clear his character by render-u ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF I ing an account of the Customs receipts, appropriated by him and his con federates, and by sending away the gang of tufangchis which surrounded him. Seyyid Murteza left no stone unturned during this time to induce sec tions of tufangchis to return in order to re-assert his control, and, as he said, hold the place against the Darya Begi, who had been despatched from Tehran as the only person likely to be able to handle the situation. His pretence was that the rest of the community were in league to oppose him and to let the Darva Begi enter Bushire on behalf of the Shah. The wind was however taken out of his sails in this respect by the receipt a few days later of a peremptory telegram from the High Priests of Nejef stating that the Darya Begi had given satisfactory undertakings to support the constitution and that his appointment had been approved by them. The situation would pro bably have been quickly restored, had the Darya Begi been able to arrive with this mandate before, but His Excellency was delayed by the impassibility of the Tigris, and he only reached Bushire on 8th May when he was well received by all parties. He having given assurances satisfactory to the Consular Body for the future maintenance of order and security, they were accepted and the blue jackets and marines ashore from H.M.S. ' Fox ' and ' Sphinx ' were re- embarked on 19th May, and H.M.S. ' Fox ' with the Senior Naval Officer, Captain A. T. Hunt, left on the 20th. The bearing of the men during a trying six weeks ashore had been admirable. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Rear-Admiral E. J. W. Slade, M.V.O., visited Bushire in the Flagship, on 27th-28th April, and inspected the arrangements and precautions in force for the maintenance of security. &gt; This troublesome chapter of Bushire history may be considered to have ended with the expulsion of Seyyid Murteza from Bushire. After being a prisoner for some time, he was placed on board the mail steamer, oA 7th July, for Basrah, and thence proceeded to Nejef where he still was when the year closed. Lingah suffered throughout the year airs at mga . from the effect of the antics and excesses of Seyyid Abdul Husein of Lar above-mentioned. Lingah being the Chief port for Lar, and having a considerable leaven of Laris in its community, events happening in Lar naturally re-act in Lingah. The keynote of Seyyid Abdul Husein's proceedings, apart from his desire for loot, is violent animosity to the Kawam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz and all his works. It was on this account that, late in December or early January 1909, the Seyyid attacked Haji Ali Kulli Khan, Deputy Governor of Lar, supposed to be a partizan of the Kawam, and badly defeated him. The Seyyid was credited with having killed 18 Gerashi notables and some 200 of the Deputy Governor's adherents. Thiswas doubtless a great exaggeration, but that he had made a successful raidi v is evidenced by the swelled head which he quickly developed. Thus he forthwith addressed the Deputy Governors and Directors of Customs at Lingah and Bandar Abbas and warned them that, if they did not obey his instructions, they would share the fate of the slain Gerashis. On hearing of his success, the Lari element at Lingah assumed a trucu lent attitude and, among other things, demanded from the Deputy Governor the release of a notorious rascal Haji Ali Lari whom he had in durance. About this time an Armenian named Aratoon, in the employ of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus, who had been sent to Lar to look for business, reached Lingah in a sorry plight having been turned out of Lar and robbed of everything he had on his way back. Early in March further missives were received in Lingah from the Seyyid in which he gave instructions (said to have been received from Nejef) for thePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 15 seizure of the Customs and the expulsion of the Belgians. He also ordered the Persian Postmaster to change his office designation and rubber stamns to ' Nationalist Post Office Lanstan ' and to cease using the Shah's stamps Letters coming from Lar now were stamped with a new stamp of the Seyyid's It was not however until news reached Lingah, on 25th March, of the r by the Na , tlonahst clement at Bushire and Bandar Abbas, that the populace came to the scratch and followed suit The DeDiitv Governor was however re-appointed on behalf of the Nationalists, while the Armenian m charge of the Customs took sanctnaiy at the British Agencv after handing over his charge.

Bustak however was the scene of disturbance for some time, in October and Novem ber the Seyyids lieutenant, Ghulam Husein Khan Varawi, and his Turake- meh tollowers having sacked the place and driven out the Sowlet-el-Mulk the hereditary Governor and adherent of the Kawamis. Ghulam Husein set up the bowlet s son as Governor, and left with the spoil, but the latter could not long maintain his position and the father eventually got back, the son Muhammad Vali Khan, migrating to Lingah. The Nationalist disturbances in the Gulf Ports, including the seizure of Commerce. Customs, combined with the situa- v ^ tion in Shiraz and on the Trade Routes roughout the year, naturally had a dire effect on the volume of trade pass ing through Bushire. r In fact, during the first five months of the year, the forwarding of goods up-eountry from Bushire practically ceased, and the Kazerun route remained cosed to caravan traffic throughout the whole period under report, the veil oemg only lifted momentarily in July by the passage of a small force of fifty men sent up emergently from Bushire to reinforce the Shiraz Consulate wnicn was thought to be in danger of attack. few caravans, as opportunity offered did, it is true, pass up and down j1 6 £. lru zabad route under the auspices of the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, Ilkhani of e Jlashgais, but nearly all the Bushire import traffic was diverted to the Ahwaz-Ispahan road. follows 6 Statistics for tlle ^ ear 21st Marcl1 1909 to 21st March 1910 were as Imports £717,091 Exports £400,893 ' showing a falling off amounting to £376,374 on the imports and £31,704 on e ex P or ts of £he year before.

Like the British Lines with sailings from Europe, the German Line felt the effect of the depression Ck J 1 'o16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP in the Gulf Trade resulting from the failure of crops and scarcity of grain. Their vessels brought 17,097 packages to Bushire as compared with 19,869 in 1908 and 3 of the steamers left the Gulf in ballast. Only 2,657 packages were exported from Bushire as compared with 4,272 in 1908. The chief item of import has been Belgian sugar and Galician kerosine, but owing to their direct connection with Antwerp, the German line are generally at an advantage compared wih the 3 British Lines. Messrs. Wonck- haus now have ten Europeans in the Gulf ports, and the German line appears to depend on them for its cargo; thus, out of 104,410 packages im ported to all Gulf ports 73,682 were for Messrs. Wonckhaus or their clients. Messrs Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have not been much in evidence during the year as far as Bushire is concerned. Like other firms importing from Europe, and from the same causes, their local business was practically paralysed. The only fact worthy of record is the attempt believed to have been made by them to secure the Agency of the Societe du Tambac. The contract for shipping the Society's consignments had of late years been in the hands of the Russian Steamship Company, but this contract is shortly coming to an end and the German Firm were anxious to secure the next one for German Shipping. His Majesty's Minister was addressed and received the authority of the Foreign Office to do what was possible, in co-operation with his Russian colleague to bring about the re-appointment of the Russian Agent when the time came. His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Marling, reported in reply that the Society was practically a department of the Ottoman Bank, and that there was nothing he could do to influence it. The Tehran Manager however informed him that the contract did not expire for another year, and that the best, offer obtainable when the time came, would be accepted. The general health of Bushire has been good. As regards the rest of the Gulf, there was a mild outbreak of Quarantine and Health. plague at Bahrain between the 12th of May and 24th of June, during which time 27 deaths from plague were re^ ported. The disease died out as in previous years as soon as the great heat commenced. The Quarantine Administration worked very smoothly throughout the year; the Residency Surgeon's relations with the Sanitary Council at Tehran were' cordial and satisfactory, and no causes of friction worth mentiomng arose in the Gulf. The Residency Surgeon's Memorandum is attached. The Resident and His Majesty's Consul-General had received instruc tions during the previous cold weather Movements and changes of officers. to proceed to Tehran in the spring to discuss various matters wUth His Majesty's Minister. His departure was rendered impossible however by the Nationalist movement in Bushire, and the season having become so far advanced by the time it became practicable for him to leave, he requested permission, on urgent private grounds, to take 3^ months' privilege leave to Europe and to proceed to Tehran from London. Sanction was accorded to this proposal and he accordingly left on the 25tn of, August, Major A. P. Trevor, First Assistant, acting for him during nis absence. Colonel Cox had a satisfactory visit to His Majesty's Minister, early in November, and returned to London, where he was detained on duty until early in the new year. The Residency Surgeon, Captain T. S. B. Williams, I.M.S., after 3| years in the post, was placed on deputation, in November 1909, for the purpose of continuing, at one of the leper hospitals in the Bombay Presidency, tne Deycke treatment which he had used with a considerable amount of success among lepers an Bushire {vide the last year's report). He was relieved by Captain C. B. McConaghy, I.M.S., formerly Resi dency Surgeon at Baghdad, on the 22nd of November. Captain M. F. White, I.M.S., Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantme Officer, proceeded on furlough in March 1909, and was not replaced, it bei gPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 17 decided that the requirements of the quarantine service could be equally well met and at less expense, by the deputation of an officer of the Indian Medical Service from Karachi or Bombay when an emergency arose,—the officer in question being ordered to hold himself in readiness to proceed to the Gulf on short notice if required.

During the year there were 59 in-patients treated in the Dispensary and The Residency Dispensary. 598 operations were performed. There were 16,422 out-patients who received medical treatment. The larger number was due to a severe outbreak of mala rial fever during the autumn which lasted 3 months, viz., September October and November.

The year 1909 marks a long step in the gradually accelerated process of General. decomposition of all authority in Fars. « . -r.,1, c . ft as marked by two main and most im portant facts. For the first time a really resolute and capable Governor- General has tailed to impose an effective authority on the province;* and for the first time a airect attack has been made on a foreign consular officer resulting in the death and wounding of members of the regular forces of a foreign Power. These two things are unprecedented, and cannot fail to produce far-reaching consequences. Another important event, in the opposite direction, is the arrival in Shiraz of a British detachment, small, but adequate for the protection of the European colony in the face of all eventualities which may reasonably be expected. Asaf-ed-Dowleh. continued to display the qualifies described in my last Local authorities. Governor-General. report Until July 1910, when he was » -P j 'n i u v&gt; t i &lt; ^ isni, i sse&lt; i an d Zil-es-Sultan appointed. Asaf-ed-Dowleh, however lingered on m Shiraz hoping for the tide to turn, unt' July 24th. The Bakhtian coup in Tehran had meanwhile been iatal to Zil-es-Sultan s appointment and he was replaced, on July 21st, by Ala- ed-Dowleh. This event brought Sowlet-ed-Dowleh to the fighting point and he declared categorically that Ala-ed-Dowleh should not enter Fars as Governor- General He also showed signs of an evident intention to maintain his puppet Asar-ed-Dowleh m power, and it was mainly in consequence of pres sure brought to bear on him by the British Consulate that the province was imally delivered ot this incubus. Sowlet meanwhile pursued his role of King maker by coming to Shiraz and negotiating the appointment of Ain-ed-Dowleh at a, telegraphic interview with the triumphant popular leaders. This ap pointment, which was made known on August 8th, was as ephemeral as the P r^ n ^ inatl0ns ' . and a PP ears to have been cancelled under the influence a + 10 i 1z j revolutionar y Taghizadeh. Finality was at last reached on August 12th by the appointment of Saham-ed-Dowleh, of which Sowlet was graciously pleased to approve, and he left Shiraz, on the 16th, to meet the new Governor-General at Abadeh. Saham-ed-Dowleh showed himself without delay to be a most remarkable ype 01 Persian. He arrived on September 20th, entirely without guards, and proceeded at once to tackle Shiraz problems with an energy to which the irazi is quite unaccustomed, but to which he submitted at first with his us omary docility, and when a visible sign of power appeared in the shape a lorce of 120 Persian Gossacks, Saham's authority seemed secure. t f i ^ s 1 ? x j :reme ty independent attitude commended itself, however, neither 0 lie religious leaders, his behaviour to whom was the reverse of conciliatory, or to the all-powerfull Sowlet, whom he further alienated by sending him niperious letters on a number of subjects, especially the extensive misbeha- iQur or a certain section of the Kashgai in injuring the telegraph line. By e close cf the year Saham-ed-Dowleh had made a strong attempt to secure e aismissal of Sowlet, and had conspicuously failed. The end of his regime January 80 ^ 611 ^ i^^^ent, and it did not in fact outlast the month of mod rU ^ e . w k^ e ^ lasted was an excellent blend of ancient principles and ^ ern practice. He soon saw, what must be obvious to any observer, that the ma ^t 218 a:re inllerentl .y incapable of anything like real self-Government, and th ^ Wln ? to thd 1 ' incurable propensity for petty little personal quarrels, con ent i r e lack of any public spirit. While therefore making apparent ^cessions to the constitutional principle by pressing on elections to the acfe anil^ irn ' es ® u J tane h&gt; in 1907, though a very capable man, seems to have been largely incapacitated by old discouraged by the conflict of authorities in Tehran. 5 - -20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Medjliss and local Council, he was careful to keep the entire direction of all affairs in his own hands, no single order issued by any department being valid without his seal. In the case of an ordinary Governor-General, this would have resulted in administrative chaos, owing to the flood of arrears which the laissez-faire policy of Asaf-ed-Dowleh had left for settlement; but Saham-ed-Dowleh united an extraordinary personal energy to an equally unusual capacity for the organization of business and the economizing of time. His system for registration of petitions, for checking the progress of business through the various departments so as to fix responsibility of delay in any particular case, and for the orderly preservation of archives, was worthy of the best modern administration, and the pertinacity with which he almost daily paid surprise visits to the various departm|nts showed that he had correctly gauged the capacity of his countrymen for sustained effort. From the day of his arrival until his failure to bluff Sowlet became obvious, he had the city completely in hand, and there can be little doubt that he would gradually have extended the circle of his authority through the province, had he only been supplied with the necessary forces from head-quarters. Thus the new constitutional experiment in Shiraz when entrusted to Saham-ed- Dowleh was in hands which were not only strong but clean. In such hands it has failed and its failure must be regarded as definitive. Moazziz-ed-Dowleh's relations with the Governor-General grew progress ively more and more strained, and he Karguzar. felt himself in a very false position on the completion of the local revolution in March. He consequently resigned at the end of April, and was directed to remain in charge until the arrival of his successor, Ehtisham-i-Humayun, from Tehran. The latter, however, never appeared, and Moazziz-ed-Dowleh eventually left with Asaf-ed-Dowleh abandoning his post without leave. At the end of July, Muvaqqar-ed-Dowleh was appointed to act and was eventually confirmed while protesting that his acceptance must be regarded as provisional. He is a familiar figure in these Administration Reports, and it is sufficient to say th&amp;t his thorough know ledge of English and unusually Western type of mind make him extremely pleasant to deal with, even though he is more tenacious of his own point of view than most Persian officials and more skilful in maintaining it. Under Asaf-ed-Dowleh, Sardar Firuz. His leading characteristics were ^ ^ described last year, and he did not im- Deputy Governor. prove He ^ ^ Under Ala-ed-Dowleh, Beha-es-Sultaneh and Mudabbir-es-Sultaneh jointly. As the first of these two was the leader of the cabal against Ala-ed- Dowleh, and the second was instantly prostrated with fever, their adminis tration was not very effective, and on the 25th July, they repudiated respon sibility for order in the town. Under Saham-ed-Dowleh, Asem-es-Sultaneh, Commander of the Buz- challu regiment. This appointment was speedily cancelled on Saham's arri val, the official in question being quite unsuitable for this or any employment. The post remained unfilled until early in December when Saham-ed-Dowleh very foolishly nominated Nasr-ed-Dowleh to it, an appointment which was no enhancement of the latter's dignity, while it gave gratuitous offence to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. For the first two months of the year the centre of gravity of Fars politics Local Politics was * n Laristan, where the Kawami brothers spent much time and money in manoeuvring according to the recognised Persian practice, i.e., combining the maximum of noise with the minimum of bloodshed. Kawam-ul-Mulk eventually abandoned the field to the Lari Seyyid and arrived in Shiraz on March 7th. The only event in Shiraz worthy of note during this period was one which illustrated better than ever the ' opera bouffe ' side of Persian poli tics. On the 20th February the Bakhtiaris in Ispahan who had control of the Ispahan telegraph office sent a telegram purporting to come from the Sadr Azam in Tehran directing Asaf-ed-Dowleh to proceed urgently to Tehran. The telegram was fully credited and Asaf-ed-Dowleh made all preparationsPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 21 for departure when, much to the regret of the inhabitants, the hoax was ex ploded by a telegram sent through the English office. This elaborate joke at the expense ot Uncle Haji , as the Shirazis commonly termed Asaf-ed- Dowleh, was mucli relished by the populace. At the end of March the Shira- Z |is, after prolonged subterranean negotiations to ensure the complete safety of all concerned, made up their minds that as all were quite unanimous there wouid be no danger to anyone if they had a revolution, which they proceeded to do, inaugurating the local assembly on the 24th March. It soon became evident, however, that the apparent unanimity which had characterised these proceedings had only been obtained by ignoring all the personal animosities which alone interest the people of Shiraz, and which continued to prevail, quite unaffected hy the floods of lofty sentiment uttered by all parties in the assembly. The latter never accomplished anything in the way of adminis tration, and spent a month in fruitless discussion of the purely academic question whether Asaf-ed-Dowleh, who refused to renounce the Shah, could continue to be recognised as Governor-General by the popular assembly' The knot was cut on the 24th April by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, who made on that date his first but by no means his last decisive irruption during the year into local politics. He wrote that he considered the assembly irregularly elected (which indeed was obviously the case, as no form of popular election had been observed), and that Asaf-ed-Dowleh must be properly obeyed as Governor- General, or he, Sowlet, would come himself and enforce obedience to him. This bomb shell knocked all the heart out of the constitutional party, which was not even revived by the belated regrant of the constitution by the Shah. By that time all eyes were again turned in the direction of Lar, which place was attacked and captured hy Nasr-ed-Dowleh, about May 12th. The Eari Seyyid took to flight, and his whereabouts remained completely unknown even to his fniends. This gave rise to an important popular agitation against the Kawamis, in the course of which the leading Mullah of the extremist party, Haji Ali Agha, took bast in the Consulate, and it was only with great difficulty that several hundreds of his adherents were dissuaded from accom- panying him. He remained (in the Consulate from May 15th to June 25th, but the true motive of his proceedings never became clear and he left without receiving any satisfaction whatever of his demands, the principal of which was the trial and punishment of the Kawami brothers for the alleged mas sacre at Lar. The popular agitation on this subject, fanned by elaborate ceremonies for the ' murdered Seyyid ' (who was really alive and in hiding) continued throughout June; the Kawam resigned all his offices, and barricaded all the entrances to his quarter, and there was a brisk but futile fusillade from the usual rival fortresses, the Persian telegraph office and the Masjid-i-Nau, almost every night. The Kawami party was further alarmed by the importation of a number of Kashgais, ostensibly intended to form a force under Sardar Firuz for the coercion of the Arab tribes, but practically employed to guard Asaf-ed-Dowleh and the Palace preqincts. One result of their arrival was the simultaneous taking of bast by the entire regular garrison and a body of irregular horse men at the British and Russian Consulates, on July 11th, on the ground that their pay was being given to the Kashgais. Meanwhile all the respectable classes in the town had joined in a vigorous agitation against Asaf-ed-Dowleh, whose intrigues and incompetence were considered to be the root cause of the existing disorders. A very extensively signed petition was sent to both Con sulates, and on July 3rd two small groups of respectively 12 and 4 persons of the middle class were admitted to bast at the British and Russian Consulates, this appearing to be the only means of averting the taking of bast en masse. At the same time, the Lari Seyyid came to life, and both he and Sowlet-ed- Dowleh sent in threatening messages to the effect that they intended to come to Shiraz and root out the Kawamis. In reply, Kawam-ul-Mulk circulated the news of his intention to br ( ing in several thousand Arabs for his own defence. The Arab Kalantars in fact telegraphed from Dehbid to the effect that they were collected there ready for a march on Shiraz. The situation being thus extremely menacing, the British and Russian Consuls visited Asaf-ed-Dowleh22 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF on the 13tli July and conveyed to him a formal warning from their Legations that he would be held personally responsible for the damage to foreign per sons or property resulting from any attack on Shiraz brought about by him, and strict orders forbidding any advance by Sowlet, Kawam or the Lari Seyyid were obtained from him. The immediate pressure was relieved by the appointment of Zil-es-Sultan which was received with the greatest enthusiasm- On the 18th July, however, the Sipahdar and Sardar Assad telegraphed announcing their own appoint ments as Minister respectively of War and Interior, and Asaf-ed-Dowleh at once claimed that the appointment of Zil-es-Sultan was cancelled by the revo lution. His hopes were however shortlived, Ala-ed-Dowleh being appointed on the 1st July. The Legation had previously been informed that it was a sine qua non for Ala-ed-Dowleh's success that he should paralyse the opposi tion which his appointment would certainly arouse by an immediate depar ture for Shiraz, but unfortunately he hesitated in Tehran until too late. On the news of his appointment Sowlet announced his determination to occupy Shiraz, to destroy the enemies of the constitution, and maintain himself by force of arms against his life-long enemy Ala-ed-Dowleh. On July 25th his definite departure for Shiraz with a large force was reported from Abadeh, and on the 26tL Kawam-ul-Muik left Shiraz for the Arab camp some 40 miles distant. As serious fighting in and about Shpaz appeared to be imminent, I considered it necessary to call for reinforcements for the Consular guard, arrangements for which had been made in anticipation, and on the same day, the 25th, at four hours' notice, the following left Bushire for Shiraz Lieut enant Crosthwaite, I. A., Lieutenant Lang, R.N., Assistant Surgeon White, I.S.M.D., one Native officer, a Sergeant and three privates of the Royal Marines with an armourer's mate, R.N., and a Maxim gun, 5 sowars and 36 sepoys. In view of the extreme importance of the force arriving before Sowlet reached SHiraz, it was unfortunately imperative that in spite of the extreme heat they should press on as fast as possible, and thlis made the march, at the worst possible season of the year, over a road the difficulty of which is pro- verbiaf, a very severe trial of endurance, which was unfortunately not accom plished without loss of life, two sepoys dying of heat stroke at Konartakhteh on July 28th. Under the- extremely adverse circumstances the arrival of the detach ment at Shiraz, on August 2nd, must be considered a remarkably creditable piece of work. There were only two actual invalids, both sepoys, who soon recovered. Meanwhile, Mr. Christmas, Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, had gone out to endeavour to delay Sowlet's arrival until after that of the detachment, in which he was completely successful, and after the entry of Lhe latter, I went out to try and persuade Sowlet not to enter Shiraz at all. He could not be brought to this, but consented to delay his entry for three days, during which the situation became sensibly calmer, especially as it became clear that the Arabs were not coming up to the scratch. Eventually on August 5th, he came in with a small body of horsemen, leaving his main body in camp some ten miles out, and after a long conversation with the Ministers he announced the appointment of Ain-ed-Dowleh as Governor- General. This remained however unconfirmed and matters remained in statu quo till Saham-ed-Dowleh's appointment on the 12th. During this period Sowlet's relations with the Consulate were of a very friendly character, and though the Kashgais made themselves unpopular by depredation on gardens and crops, their behaviour was not bad on the whole, and there was no serious fracas. He finally left the neighbourhood of Shiraz on the 14th, on which date the bazaars were fully opened for the first time since the disorders began. From these events two conclusions, of importance may be drawn, which are probably generally valid although circumstances might occur to modify them. The first is that the Arabs will not fight the united Kashgais, at any rate for the ' beaux yeux ' of the Kawami brothers; and the second is that the Kashgais are at present more united in submission to Sowlet -ed-Dowleh thanPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 23 was generally believed. He was supported by horsemen from all the lead ing sections including the very important Shishbuluki, whose chief, Ahmed Khan, is father-in-law of Sowlet's rival. Zeigham-ed-Dowleh and was con sidered to be a devoted adherent of the latter. It is also to be' noted that the flow of bloodthirsty and excited proclamations from Sowlet's camp ceased completely after his interview with Mr. Christmas, and his threats of re prisals against the Kawami partisans remained entirely unexecuted, a change of attitude which I am inclined to attribute very largely to the arrival of the British detachment, providing as it did a very timely and salutary reminder that there were other forces to be considered besides the local partisans. The interregnum which ensued was, as usual, quite peaceful in Shiraz itself, although the province was overrun by robbers in every direction, and nothing worthy of note occurred until the arrival of Saham-ed-Dowleh on September 20th. As already noted, he tackled the outstanding local questions with great energy and as far as the town was concerned with complete success. He was never on good terms with Sowlet, who had apparently expected a much meeker attitude on the part of the Governor-General, and the latter's position grew progressively worse as Sowlet's insubordination became more evident. None the less, the position appeared at one time so favourable, that all arrangements were made for the withdrawal of the British detachment, which was to start on November 14th. On the 13th, however, as a result of a violent quarrel between the Governor-General and Shaikh-ul-Mulk, the newly arrived Rais-i- Adliyyeh or President of the Provincial Court of Justice, Saham telegraphed to Tehran insisting that either he or his antagonist must resign. The ques tion dragged on and was expanded by Saham-ed-Dowleh into a demand for permission to expend all Fars revenues on local purposes including the rais ing of troops, and it became clear that a serious crisis had been reached. The Karguzar went so far as to write privately urging me to keep the detachment for the time being, and it was decided to postpone their departure at lealt until after their winter clothing had been received from Eushire. The situation in the town improved slightly as the result of the transfer of Shaikh- ul-Mulk to Ispahan, but nothing beyond vague promises was obtained from the Central Government in response to the further demands of the Governor- General. On the 24th, the very grave event already alluded to occurred, the caravan accompanying M. Passek and Kadloubousky, the Russian Consul- General and his Assistant, on their way to Bushire, being subjected to a heavy fire near Khan-i-Zinian and looted, one Russian Cossack being killed and one Russian and two Persian Cossacks being wounded. On receiving the news with a request from M. Passek for medical assistance, I at once left with Dr- Woollatt, 12 sowars of the Consulate and 29 Persian Cossacks, and the whole party was brought in safely on the 25th. The body of the Cossack was buried with full military honours on the 26th, the Governor accompany ing the cortege as far as the town and the Karguzar being present through out the cereimony, in which the whole of the British detachment took part. The arrangements were made by Lieutenant Lang at M. Passek's request and the ceremony, which passed off without a hitch, attracted much attention in the town, and unquestionably produced a good effect. Meanwhile, the pilgrims who had formed part of the caravan, and had in many cases lost all they possessed, were very justifiably besieging the Governor-General with petitions for the recovery of their property, and the party hostile to the Governor-General seized the opportunity to excite popu lar feeling against him. This came to a head on the 28th when a large crowd demanded the instant execution of a policeman who was alleged to have shot a man improperly in the street. This being refused, several shots were fi re ^ ail d a scene of great confusion ensued, during which Saham-ed-Dowleh escaped from the Palace on foot, leaving his private apartments to be looted ^ ^he mob. The latter however were easily dispersed by a few shots being jired in the air by Cossacks from an adjacent tower, and Saham returned. 1 his incident dealt a heavy blow to his personal prestige, which was all he a d to depend upon.24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF He spent the remainder of the year in fruitless negotiations with the Central Government, in which he was consistently supported by the two Consuls. But as soon as it became clear that the Central authorities were unable to force Sowlet to accept the Governor-General's authority, and unwilling or afraid to dismiss him, it was obvious that Saham-ed-Dowleh's regime was doomed. Needless to say the Russian robbery went entirely unpunished, and it was not clearly ascertained who the perpetrators were, although some of them belong undoubtedly to the Boir Ahmadi section of the Kuhgelu. The year thus closed with the gloomiest possible prospects for the future, the prestige of the Persian authorities having been heavily damaged by the failure of Saham-ed-Dowleh, a man far above the average of Governors-General in both character and ability, and the customary inviolability of foreign Consular officers having been finally broken down. It remains to be mentioned that Seyyid Abdul Husein, the Lari firebrand, was sent for by the new Government to come to Tehran and explain his highly suspicious proceedings, but he succeeded in arriving in Shiraz on November 19th, although the orders sent were to the effect that he was not to enter the town. He remained apparently in strict retirement until the close of the year, although he received a secret visit from Nasr-ed-Dowleh, at which it is probable that some cash changed hands. The departure of the Shiraz deputies for Tehran should also be noted, although it attracted little atten tion and the validity of their election was subsequently questioned. The prestige and self-confidence of this important tribe and of its leader Nomad tribes. Kashg™. Sowlet-ed-Dowleh has increased greatly during the year. As already noted they have displayed an unanimity unprecedented in the history of the tribe, and the consolidation of Sowlet's authority, due to the practical disappearance of his brother Zeigham-ed-Dowleh from the tribal politics, is sufficient by itself to render the tribe twice as formidable as it has been in the past. It is freely alleged that Saham-ed-Dowleh's failure to procure Sowlet's dismissal was due to the latter having bribed Sipahdar, and it would cer tainly seem improbable that Sardar Assad, with whom he is on the worst of terms, would not have seized the opportunity to dismiss him, had he not met with strong resistance from his colleague. As a result it is doubtful whether any attention would now be paid by the Kashgais to orders from Tehran dismissing Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, and it seems far more likely that the only result would be to provoke the latter to open rebellion. Not only the Kashgais, but the Farsis in general are accustomed to speak contemptuously of the present Government as ' those (variously qualified) Bakhtiaris in Tehran, and it is by no means improbable that Sowlet, cautious as he is by nature, may, during the ensuing year, be driven by public opinion Within his tribe to some overt act of hostility against the ascendancy of the Bakhtiari, whom every Kashgai considers inferior to his tribe both in courage and m nurnbers. It is safe to say that very little of the old time prestige of lehran and the Shah's Government has descended to the persons now in power, who are regarded rather as a band of unusually successful robbers than as the representatives of duly constituted authority. -r^ e ^ r ^. e were on t-he whole, well in hand throughout the year, although the Darshuri and Farsimadan sections made themselves conspicuous in the autumn by extensive damage to the telegraph line between Dastarjin and Kazerun, and by maltreating the Armenian signaller at the latter place, the result being a total interruption which showed signs of continuing indefinitely. I consequently paid a visit to Sowlet's camp and was assured that all the dam- asp was being done by a contumacious Kashgai chief in order to discredit his (bowlets) authority; but this is hardly credible, as the damage was too exten sive to have been done by a small party, and moreover it ceased completely the moment Sowlet issued orders to that effect; I have consequently little doubt that the damage^ was done wih his knowledge as a conspicuous demon stration of the incapacity of Saham-ed-Dowleh to keep order.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909.

The imports could not Trade - be distributed owing to the inability of the pedlars to circulate, while the exports were not brought in as usual, the villages not venturing to risk their animals on the outlying routes. There was a short period of relative prosperity for the import trade on the arrival of Saham-ed-Dowleh when a fair quantity of goods were cleared at reasonable prices, but this did not last beyond November ; while the exports are estimated at about half the volume of 1908. The opium crop was not a very good one, although prices were slightly above the average, the European markets were still overstocked with gums, while the merchants, who began to ship almonds freely on the news' of good prices in Europe, due chiefly to the Messina earthquake, in most cases lost money owing to an unexpected drop m the price. During the summer the Bushire trade mostly followed the Firuzabad route, which was under the control of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. This was fairly safe, but quite unfitted for any but summer use, owing to the absence of accom modation. Unfortunately Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, having once tasted the pecuni ary advantages derivable from the control of the main trade route, is not at a^ likely to relinquish them at any season of the year. On this subject the tabular list of travellers and robberies below furnished the most eloquent commentary possible. Public security. All the roads, with the exception of the Sarhad (summer) route to Ispahan and the Firuzabad route to Bushire were in a state of chronic insecurity, and several robberies took place even on the two exceptions mentioned above, which are under the control of Sowlet-ed- Dowleh. Things improved slightly during the first two months of Saham-ed- Dowleh's regime, and pedlars were able to circulate. But it is no exaggera tion to say that at no time during the year was there any real security xor travellers in any part of the province. The total amount of British claims, of which the vast majority are for road robberies, rose during the year from tomans 40,609 to tomans 57,sol, only one robbery claim of any importance being paid, namely £138, tor a robbery of Messrs. Ziegler's goods, although several outstanding commercia cases were settled by Saham-ed-Dowleh. The most important robberies of British goods were :—4 chests of opium valued at £520, the property of Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co.; piece-goo f valued at tomans 1,888, the property of Messrs.

After the robbery of their caravan they returned to Shiraz and remained until the close of the year. From the personal point of view, the British and Russian Consulates were extremely friendly throughout, though their official relations were clouded for a time by the extraordinary episode of the appointment of Nasr- ed-Dowleh as Russian Consular Agent in June. It is impossible to conjecture with the knowledge available here what the Russian object can have been in this amazing appointment, which was made without the slightest preliminary warning to the British Consulate. It seems equally incredible on the one hand that the Russian authorities shou d not have realized the enormous extension of their direct responsibilities m Fars entailed thereby (Nasr-ed-Dowleh and his brother owning enormous estates in all parts of the province, some part of which is perpetually benjg ravaged by so^e enemy of their family), and on- the other that they should have seriously contemplated assuming the vast responsibilities in the neutral zone which this appointment would at any rate in general popular expecta tion have thrust upon them. The incident must remain a mystery and a decidedly unpleasant one. The appointment was the subject of emphatic protest by the British Consulate and Legation, it was apparently never re cognised by the Persian Government, and terminated in a sat !f ® ct f { ^7 bv Nasr-ed-Dowleh's resignation after Saham-ed-Dowleh s arnval a settte- ment which is largely attributable to the tact and influence of Muvaqqar-ed- Dowleh.

The condition of the districts of Bandar Abbas and Minab has been much disturbed throughout the greater part of the year owing chiefly to the evil influence of Seyyid Abdul Husexn of Lar, who, from the beginning of the year till his deportation to Shiraz in November, continued to send out emissaries and letters inciting the people to rebellion His efforts, aided by the preaching of iseyyid Assadulla Ispaham, pro duced the so-called 'Nationalist' revolution which broke out in Bandar Abbas on March 16th. The movement, so far as the vast majority of the people were concerned, had little to do with ' Nationalism ' in any real sense of the term. The people as a whole were partly excited by, partly afraid of, the Seyyid of Lar, and their excitement was added to by the fulmmations of Seyyid Assadulla. It was taken advantage of by a few influential and un scrupulous persons who profited by the misappropriation of a considerable portion of the Customs receipts. , , . , ^ ^ ^ The movement maintained an orderly character throughout partly through the influence of Seyyid Assadulla, who appears to have teen an intelli gent and high-minded man, and partly through that of Misbah-i-Diwan. The latter became Deputy Governor on the outbreak of the rebellion in addition to his duties as Deputy Karguzar. He is a man whose every instinct is opposed • to nationalist ideals, but he led and controlled the movement from motives of policy and private gain. ^ ,, The revolution came to an end in the middle of May after the Shan s pro clamation had announced the re-grant of the Constitution, and after the re turn of His Excellency Darya Begi to the Governorship of the Gulf Ports. Simultaneously with the close of the revolution Seyyid Abdul Husem was driven from Lar by Nasr-ed-Dowleh. He however retained all his power for evil and continued to exercise it to the full with the result that the town of Bandar Abbas remained in a constant state of panic, the district in a con stant state of disturbance and trade practically at a standstill. In August the Seyyid succeeded in re-entering Lar and re-assertmg his influence there. Shortly afterwards hbwever his tyranny, mischief making and utter irresponsibility had become so intolerable that his deportation to Shiraz was decided on by the central Government and was effected m November. * e ^ a With his departure the quiet of the country and the safety ot the roads were restored immediately. The country people however continued to some extent to resist payment of the revenue demand, and up to the end of the cal- t endar year this demand had not been met in full. ttt- tt t Consulate—Ch&amp;vge of the Consulate was held by Captain W.

Adil-es-Sultan, who losing one of his . , mei i in the strife, effected his escape after having been severely wounded in the leg, and returned to Kerman. Gunj Ali Khan, the Head of the Afshars, took possession of a government gun which the Governor had with him at Baft. Gunj Ali Khan remained refractory throughout the year pillaging the surrounding villages of Kerman till the arrival of the Kawam at Kerman. When the Kawam summoned him, he was rather afraid of coming into Ker- • inan, and wanted assurances for his safety, which the Kawam granted, and he arrived in the town with a number of his tribesmen and took sanctuary at the palace with the Kawam himself. On the Kawam's enquiry, Gunj Ali Khan stated that he had taken possession of the gun simply to protect it for the sake of the government, and that he was quite willing to give it up. He sent for the field-piece afterwards and handed it over to the Kawam. Kawam interceded and made the Sardar-i-Nasrat and his brother Adil-es-Sultan friends again and conferred the Governorship of Akta and Afshar on Gunj AH Khan and sent him back to the Iliats, with orders to work conjointly with the Sartips, Abdul Muzaffar Khan and Muhammad Khan, who were ap pointed Governors of Rudbar and Jiruft respectively. The Sahib-i-Ikhtiar resigned his post of Governorship in the middle of the year under report, but remained here till August asking Tehran authori ties to remit him his travelling allowances. While Sahib-i-Ikhtiar was en route to Tehran, two bands of Farsi rob bers attacked Rafsinjan and clean swept all its surrounding villages : the loss in property and animals was estimated at about 80,000 tomans. The robbers threatened to sack Kerman, and it was just at that time when the Kawam was coming to disperse the robbers. While the robbers were plundering the coun try, Mr. Wright of the Imperial Bank of Persia, proceeding on leave to Eng land via Ispahan, and passing by Rafsinjan road, was captured by robbers who stripped him of everything he possessed. After three days he was re- jeased and, having joined Sahib-i-Ikhtiar, accompanied him as far as Yezd. oahib-i-Ikhtiar was also besieged by the robbers, but he took up a strong posi tion in one of the bastions with his armed sowars and men immediately close to his person and prepared to defend himself. Mr. Wright estimated his loss in property and animals at 4,000 tomans. While the Kawam was coming to rescue the district from the hands of robbers, the Governor-Generalship of the Province was offered him and ac cepted. He arrived in Kerman in the month of October 1909. . &amp; a fat-i-Nizam who played a prominent part in the revolutionary period in Bam and was once expelled to Meshed, returned to stir up the people again, ^ was soon called to Tehran.

Several times the Governors tried to collect revenue, but the Baluchi Sardars would not come to terms until Wali Khan was appointed Governor of Baluchistan. The latter led an expeditionary force through Persian Baluchistan and managed to extort a sum of about 12,000 tomans, and remitted it to Kerman. After Wali Khan's return from Baluchistan, Sardars Syed Khan, Bahrain Khan and Jihand presumably divided Baluchistan between them and con templated an attempt to sack Bam and Narmashir, but the threats used by Major Duoat in a telegram to them to the effect that should they show any kind of attempt to plunder Bam, or show any sign of movement beyond their jurisdictions, a British force would at once be ordered from British Baluchis tan for their chastisement, prevented them from doing so. They replied to the British Consul's telegram in a friendly tone, based on loyalty to their government. The Kawam contemplates making a tour throughout Baluchistan later on in order to bring the Baluchi Sardars to some understanding about the revenue, and for this definite purpose, he has asked the Tehran authori ties to provide him with arms and ammunition. Though the Sahib-i-Ikhtiar had resigned his post of Governorship, he remained in Kerman for nearly four months endeavouring to get Kerman merchants to give him a loan to enable him to get back to Tehran. During • this period Bashir-i-Khakan was offered the Deputy-Governorship but he re fused to accept, as Sahib-i-Ikhtiar intrigued against him. The town m the meantime remained in a state of chaos, and neither bread nor sugar was obtainable in the bazaar. Only 2 bakers' shops were open which were sur rounded by crowds who swooped down on the bread like kites. The merchants moreover took to paying the Charvadars to keep out of the town, as any loads of sugar coming in were at once scrambled for and disappeared before the owner could get it to his shop. In fact there was a partial famine in the M. von der Flaas, the Russian Military Attache at Seistan, having tra velled via Sipeh, Fahraj and Bam, ar- visitors ' rived at Kerman, in April, and after put ting up at the Russian Consulate for a short period, left for his destination.

Since his arrival postal arrangements have been better: robberies of posts, however, have not been an unusual occurrence. Some improvements have lately been made in the Telegraph Departmen including the addition of new Telegraph Telegraphs. and Xe^phone stations at Kamalabad, Mehdiabad and Tehrud, but the direct line from Kerman to Bandar Abbas, which is very much needed, is still lacking.

[For approximate boundaries of these Divisions see Administration Report of 1905-06.J Mir Barkat has been the recognised chief of the district up to the end of February, but I understand the Biyaban District. Governor of Bushire has had consider able difficulty in recovering anything towards the annual tax money for which Barkat is responsible. Mir Barkat was much annoyed at the refusal of the inhabitants of Minab to meet his demand for 4,000 krans for protecting them against the raids made by the Chief of Rudbar last year. Through out the summer Barkat's followers made petty raids in the Minab district and altogether looted 37 camels, and other property belonging to the inhabi tants of Minab. On the 8th March 1910, His Excellency the Darya Begi arrived at Jask. Major Austin proved to His Excellency that Mir Barkat had been taking a very active part in the arms traffic, and induced him to deport Mir Barkat. The Darya Begi and Mir Barkat are close friends, ' and it is therefore extremely doubtful whether Mir Barkat would ever have gone further than Bandar Abbas, had not the Resident gone there in the ' Lawrence ' and personally taken the matter in hand. The deportation of Mir Barkat has had very great effect, and it is now thought that the Afghans will experience some difficulty in getting help of any description from Baluchis. Slaves.—Two cases of traffic in slaves, from the Biyaban to the Arabian Coast, were reported during the year. On the Mth April 1909, one Bash- kardi girl was sent by boat (Nakhoda Muhammad Ali) frona Bunji by Mir Barkat as a present to Ali Khan, an arms dealer in Maskat On the 7th J my 1909, two Baluch slaves (one male and one female) were shipped to Maskat from Gunari by a Baluch subject of Biyaban, named Hasham. The proceeds of the sale were to be invested in the purchase of rifles. Mir Mustapha Khan and Mir Barkat were more friendly during the early part of the year, but m August, Jask District. while ^ f orm er was in Bashakird, two of his sons, Cheragh Khan and Murad (aged 22 and 20 years respectively), looted some camels belonging to a subject of Mir Barkat.

Early in July 1909 information was received to the effect that Bahram Khan of Dizak had again attacked Bampur with a strong following and had taken possession of the Fahraj Fort. Sardar Seyyed Khan joined Bahram Khan and appears to have taken possession of the town of Bampur. Many camels and a considerable amount of grain was looted and removed to Dizak and Gaih. Sirgan Sub-District. —Mir Wali Muhammad, headman of Sirgan Sub- district, died on the 9th August 1909, and was succeeded by his brother Mir Nazar Muhammad, with effect from 1st July 1909. Bir Sub-District. —Fourteen insulators were broken by Afghan followers of Dur Muhammad Khan, brother of Khalifa Khair Muhammad, in the Bir district, during December 1909. The telegraph line was also cut near Bir river, on the 8th January 1910, by a party of Afghan gun runners. Mir Sahib Khan of Bir did what he could to prevent any recurrence of damage to the telegraph line, but I regret to say Mir Sheroo of Bir took no steps what ever in the matter. Slave Traffic. —Five cases of slave dealing came to notice during the year. Mir Mahmood Khan and Mir Din Muhammad have not been friendly _ ,, . ^ , during the year. The latter is still very as yan is nc . young and he has bad advisers who were formerly employed by his father, Mir Abdi. On the 20th January 1909, Mir Din Muhammad's followers killed the wife of a British Indian subject. The case was reported to the Clerk in Charge, Charbar. On the same day Din Muhammad's men looted the house of one of my linemen named Siaho. Of this I have made a special report to the Director and recommended that Mir Din Muhammad's subsidy should be withheld for a period of one year, or stopped altogether and paid to Mir Mahmood Khan. On the 18th November 1909, Mir Nawab Khan with a force of 200 men . attacked Jalal Khan (brother of Mir Ahmed Khan), who took refuge with 20 men in the Gwettur Fort. Nawab Khan besieged the fort for about a fort night but Jalal Khan had provisioned the fort and dug a well. I do not think Jalal Khan lost any men but there were a few casualties amongst Nawab Khan's men. At this time Mir Ahmed Khan was in Karachi. He arrived at Gwadur soon after the affair started and took passage in a native boat to Bris where he landed and proceeded to Dashtyari to collect a follow ing and get help from Mir Mahmood Khan. Nawab Khan was eventually persuaded to withdraw, and since then no trouble has occurred. When the fight commenced the inhabitants of Gwettur left for Gwadur and Charbar, the town has been practically deserted since then.

MoDouall, who for 18 years had been stationed as Vice-Consul and Consul at Mohammerah, was transferred to Kermanshah, and Captain L. B. H. Haworth, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Kermanshah, was appointed Consul for Arabistan. The Mohammerah Consulate was now brought within the sphere of the Persian Gulf Residency. Mr. McDoualjl left Mohammerah to take up his new post on the 27th July, having handed over charge temporarily to Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, I.A. (at the time in charge of the Indian Oil Guards), on the 24th. Captain Haworth proceeded direct from Kermanshah to England on sick leave. His Excellency Haji Saif-ed-Dowleh, who arrived at Nasiri in October 1908, as Governor of Arabistan, re- Locai authorities. mained in Mohammerah or Nasiri as Shaikh Khazal's guest, until May 1909, without once visiting Shushtar, the nominal capital of the province and the seat of the Government. Soon after the death of his grand-daughter. Shaikh Khazal's wife, Jamil- es-Sultaneh, he applied to the Central Government for leave to resign, which not being granted, he left by the Bakhtiari road without more ado. In October 1909, Fakhr-ul-Mulk, with his son, Fakhr-ul-Mamaldk, and his grandson, Izz-ul-Mamalik, arrived at Shushtar from Ispahan to take up the Governorship, which had been held during the interregnum with some success by Shaikh Khazal. On arrival at Shushtar he was coldly but politely received by the local headmen, whom he rated soundly 'for having paid arrears of revenue to Shaikh Khazal. This rather injudicious step caused temporary estrangement between him and the latter, and the situation was not improved by the more or lesa successful efforts he made to introduce a Constitutional regime into Arabistan. He was unprovided with any troops when in Shush tar, and was without any moral or physical support in his task of recovering arrears of taxation and safeguarding Dizful and the Dizful-Shushtar road from the raids of Arabs and Sagwands. The local c medjliss ' which he convened in Shushtar and in Diz'ful were viewed with disfavour by the principal townsmen, and it cannot be said that the constitional regime has proved a success up to the present. His grandson, a young man of about 25, was sent as Deputy Governor to Dizful at the end of October, under the protection of Assad Khan and the leading men. A. Rahim, a minor Bakhtiari notable, who was attached to Fakhr-ul- Mulk's staff by the Bakhtiari Khans, did his best to stir up strife between the new Governor of Arabistan and the Shaikh, and between the Shaikh and the various Arab chiefs under his sway, such as the exiled Maulas and Shaikhs of Hawizeh, Farhan Assad, Haidar-bin-Ghafil, Shaikh Jafar of the Chab, and so on, but without success. Towards the end of the year, however, relations between Fakhr-ul-Mulk and the Shaikh improved, the former finding it politic to work in harmony with the latter and, at the end of 1910, Fakhr-ul-Mulk paid a visit to Shaikh Khazal at Mohammerah and initiated the outward forms of constitutionalism there.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 37 In June 1909, Shaikh Hanzal, Deputy Governor of Nasiri, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy against Shaikh Khazal, and imprisoned. It is difficult to say whether the charge was well founded or seriously believed by Khazal, hut the occasion was undoubtedly a convenient one to enable the latter to send his eldest son Chasib, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, to Nasiri as Deputy Governor, on his return in August from Dizful where he had been acting in a similar capacity. The change much improved this young man, who had suffered not a little in health and character from association with men of indifferent character in Mohammerah. Shaikh Abdul Majid, a little son of the Shaikh, was nominally Governor of Fallahiyah, throughout the year, four of the principal Shaikhs acting as a council of regency under his nominal control. Another baby son ('Abdullah) of the Shaikh was nominal Deputy Governor in Hindi an throughout the year, the actual government being carried on by his mother's father, Mir 'Abdullah of Hindian, who also con trolled the districts of M'ashur and Jarrahi. The Karguzar at Mohammerah for the past three years—Saad-es-Sultan —exchanged posts with the Ittila-ed-Dowleh, Karguzar of Bushire, who had to leave the latter town owing to difficulties with the Darya Begi. Saad-es- Sultan had given satisfaction to all classes, and his departure was univer sally regretted. His successor accused him of pro-German tendencies, with what truth it is hard to say : he himself always professed an impartial standpoint with regard to foreigners, and this attitude may have given rise to the charge against him. He was in receipt of substantial presents from the Shaikh and from Haji Rais, and may have been somewhat pro-German in the days when Haji Rais was the agent of R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. in Mohammerah. Monsieur Leleux was replacel in April by M. Zwinne, on transfer of n x . - • . • 1. 'the former to Bushire. Although the Customs Administration. . n rq iij latter was personally agreeable, and had the reputation of being perfectly clean-handed, he caused much annoyance to the Shaikh, and to British and native firms, by introducing harsh and novel interpretations of the Customs Regulations, enforcing fines, and causing rigorous and unnecessary searches to be made. His attitude was probably due partly to a desire to perform his duty conscientiously, partly to his inherent tendency to adhere to the letter rather than to the spirit of the regulations, enforcing fines, the insistent demands for remittances by the Central Government. Smuggling continued unabated throughout the year. The Customs Ad- tninistration are powerless at present to check it, and the Shaikh, on financial and political grounds, is unwilling to assist them. No cases of plague occurred during the year. Assistant Surgeon G. C. _ Rehling, I.S.M.D., continued to hold the Quaran me. position of Quarantine Medical Officer for the port throughout the year. The service was maintained satisfactorily and without any friction. The local Persian Postal Service was satisfactorily carried on, and no losses or serious outrages were reported. , 08 s ' A postman was attacked near Kut Abdallah (Nasiri) in December, but the mails were not touched. The Arabistan Telegraphs Convention was signed on the 17th June, and at the end of the year awaited the Telegraphs. necessary ratification by the Persian Medjliss- The Persian Telegraphs worked most unsatisfactorily throughout the year, and were a source of much annoyance to British firms in Arabistan. A proposal by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, to join with the indo-European telegraph Department in running a telegraph wire down W pipe line and in sharing the cost was not accepted by the Department.38 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The charitable dispensary in Mohammerah, managed by the Quarantine Medical Officer on behalf of the Govern- MedlcaL ment of India at an annual cost to the latter of R150 (plus free medicines), was maintained throughout the year. The Shushtar-Dizful road was unsafe for the greater part of the year, the only authority who made any serious Commumcations. attempt to keep it open being Shaikh Khazal, when Acting Governor of Arabistan. In October, a large caravan of some 350 mules was captured and driven off by radders belonging to the Sagwand and to the Mushattat's (Arab) tribe : nothing was recovered from them. The rest of the roads in Arabistan were safe throughout the year as usual. The ' Nusrat ' (Persian owned) and the ' Malamir ' (Euphrates and / Tigris Steam Navigation Company— Karun Navigation—Lower River. Agents : Lynch Brothers) continued throughout the year. The state of the river from September until the end of the year was worse than usual and the ' Malamir ' was in consequence unable to take more than 100 tons a trip- The Karun changed its course below Nasiri in the sprang, cutting through a split of land below Umm-ut-Tummair, and lessen ing the distance to Nasiri from Mohammerah by 6 miles. At the end of the year S. L. ' Ishtar ' was put on the Karun to tow barges between Mohammerah and Ahwaz and, in the middle of December, the ' Blosse Lynch ' was brought from Basrah to cope with the heavy arrears of cargo destined for Ahwaz which had been accumulating at Mohammerah: it made only one trip, and, failing to reach Nasiri owing to the shoals in the river, it was sent back to Baghdad. The P. S. ' Shushan ' (owned by the Persian Government, run by Messrs. Lynch Brothers) continued to run from Upper Karun. Ahwaz to Shalaili throughout the year without mishap, as also did the ' M'awin.' Arrangements are in progress to equip the ' Shushan ' to burn oil in place of wood. It was announced in September that the Bank intended to open a branch in Mohammerah and, in December, Mr. Imperial Bank of Persia. R R Dewar Durie arr i v e d from Eng- land to commence business. The establishment of a branch of the Bank in Mohammerah was welcomed by the local authorities and by the merchants, and no difficulty was experienced in obtaining suitable quarters. Business was formally commenced on 1st January 1910. Diztful and Shushtar were visited more than once during the year, and friendly relations maintained with Shaikh Muhammad Hassan, Chief Muj- tahid in Dizful, and Muhammad Baqir, his son, and with the Mustaufi of Shushtar, Mirza Tahir Khan, and his son. A third visit was paid to Kut Nahr Hashim on New Year's Day with Sir William Willcpcks, the results of which are touched on below under the heading Karkha Irrigation Scheme. A two years' option, from 10th January 1909, for a ' concession d'exploi- tation a 1'Ahwaz ' was granted to M.

His Majesty's Minister promptly lodged an objection to the granting of such a concession without previous consultation with Great Britain, and stated that the British Government reserved the right to object to any conces sion that was prejudicial to her interests and was not favourably received by the Shaikh. The latter was greatly perturbed at the possibility of the land on the banks of the Karun, now in occupation of the tribes under him, being granted to foreigners to develop, and the iniudicious boasting of Mr. ter Meulen at Ahwaz did not reassure him. Our assurances, however,POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 89 quieted his fears, and since April 1909 nothing more has been heard of the option. When visiting Ahwaz, Sir W. Willcocks expressed the opinion that the Karkha irrigation Scheme. Karkha River offered greater facilities ..... tor irrigation than the Karun and re commended investigation m this direction. Lieutenant Wilson afterwards visited the Karkha and made a preliminary report, strongly recommending that the scheme, which seemed easy and remunerative, should receive careful examination at the hands of experts. Lieutenant Wilson subsequently visited the Karkha with Mr. J, W. Storrs, Public Works Department, during August and September, and with the assistance of two 'surveyors the latter prepared detailed maps and plans with levels of the environs of Sinn-ul-'Abbas, Kut Nahr Hashim, and of the lands that would be watered by the proposed canal. On 1st Januarj 1910, Sir W. Willcocks visited the Karkha with Mr. J. W. Storrs and Lieutenant Wilson and selected Sinn-ul-'Abbas as the best situation for a dam. The site selected was a spur of rock 800' long and 100' broad running right across the river. The estimated cost of the dam and the main canal to Kut Nahr Hashim (from which point irrigation would begin) was put at £75,000, and the area irrigated thereby 100,000 acres winter and summer. Sir William Willcocks thought that the Shaikh should make 20 per cent, on the capital outlay. The inception at the commencement of the year of this Company, with Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ld. a Capital of £2,000 000 Under a powerful directorate and with the close support of the Burma Oil Company, is undoubtedly the most important and far-reaching event affecting British interests that has happened in Arabistan since the opening of the Karun in 1888. The Company took over Mr. W. K. D'Arcy's concession, and all the assets and liabilities of the Concession Syndicate, Limited, the Company which had bored for oil in the Bakhtiari country and found it, in 1908. Its effect on the Khans is dealt with in the report otf the Ahwaz Consulate. Shortly after the announcement of the formation of the Company in London, the Company's representative approached the Shaikh with a view to leasing land on Abadan Island, for a refinery site, and arranging for a pipe line from the oil fields to this spot through the Shaikh's territories, and other facilities. A rough agreement was come to verbally, but at a price (£2,000) which was considered unsatisfactory by the Directors. The Political Resident was, therefore, asked to commence negotiations with the Shaikh with a view to obtaining the land and other facilities asked for at a cheaper rate. Simultaneously, the Company decided to entrust the management of their affairs in Arabistan to agents, as in Burma and else where in the case o'f the Burma Oil Company, and Mr. J. B. Lloyd, a partner in the firm of Shaw, Wallace &amp; Co., arrived in June to commence business as managing agents and general merchants under the name of Lloyd, Scott &amp; Co. With him was Mr. C- A. Walpole, 'formerly of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who took charge of the business from July to December in the absence of Mr. J. B. Lloyd in England. Mr. E. B. Soane, also formerly of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was appointed to the staff of Messrs. Lloyd, Scott &amp; Co. in December. Major Cox interviewed the Shaikh on the subject of land acquisition in May and obtained *from him a declaration that he was prepared to lease the land required on certain conditions, for an annual rental of £650 per annum, payable in advance. The principal conditions were that, on the expiration of the concession, all buildings, machinery, etc., should lapse to him, and that in case of renewal the lands, buildings, etc., should be leased from him 0 r from his descendants on terms satisfactory to the latter. After much telegraphic correspondence on the subject, Major Cox pro ceeded to Mohammerah, at the end of June, in company with Mr. McDouall, lieutenant Wilson, and Mr. J. B. Lloyd to Ahwaz to meet the Shaikh and conclude an agreement. Negotiations extended over four days, and an agree ment was finally signed whereby an area of 650 jaribs on Abadan Island4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF between Braim and Bawardeh with a frontage of 2,000 yards on the Shatt- el-Arab was leased to the Company for £650 per annum payable ten years in advance. They further acquired a strip of land for a right of way across the island, and the right to acquire more land free of date trees elsewhere, should the above site prove unsuitable, and another 100 jaribs adjacent to the above site, at the same rate if asked for within two years, and at the local fair current rate if asked for after that time. Land for the laying of the pipe line and for pumping stations, etc., was also granted, as well as an area of ten jaribs at Ahwaz above the rapids, for the purposes of the Company. The period of the lease was for the period of the concession or for any extension or renewal thereof, but in the latter case a rent of £1,500 per annum was to be paid. The lease was to be binding on the Shaikh and his heirs, successors and tribesmen, and was subsequently signed by tribal heads. It was also found necessary to give the Shaikh a separate confidential assurance to the effect that if, when the concession expired, the Persian Government claimed the buildings, machinery, etc., on the land leased from the Shaikh, he would be assisted to arrive at a favourable settlement with that Government by His Majesty's Government. By the end df December some 6,000 tons of material for the Oil Company had arrived and of which 4,000 tons were landed on Abadan Island at Braim, whence it was to be slowly removed up country by the R. S. ' Malamir,' S. L- ' Ishtar,' and the R. S. ' Blosse Lynch,' Messrs. Lynch Brothers having contracted to carry 8,000 tons within three months. It is early to say much as to the prospects of the Company. All that can be said is that they appear to have plenty of oil and that their difficulties will commence when they attempt to sell large quantities of oil in competition with American and Russian Companies. The cost of production of their oil seems likely to be high, and Mohammerah is not near to any large market for oil. Mr. C. Ritchie, of J. L. Weir, Limited, Glasgow, spent three months during the summer surveying and examining the country between Masjid-i- Sulaiman and Mohammerah, and Mamatain and Ahwaz, with a view to find ing the best route for the pipe lines, for which his firm has the contract. A proposal from the Company, in 1909, to join with the Indo-European Telegraph Department in erecting a telegraph line to run down their pipe line, from Ahwaz to Mohammerah, bifurcating off a few lines above Moham merah, one line crossing the Karun and entering the town, the other con tinuing to Abadan, was rejected by the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment. It was intended in November to sink the ' Dwina,' an old lighter be longing to Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co- of Basrah, on the mud at low water mark on the bank of the Shatt-el-Arab near Braim to act as a pier for ocean steamers when discharging pipe line material. Unfortunately, how ever, the mud proved too soft to sustain the weight of the ' Dwina' when she was filled with mud in order to sink her, and breaking her chains she slipped down the bank into 8 fathoms of water, 200 feet from the bank, a total loss. Fortunately, the wreck does not lie in the fairway channel and is not a source df danger to navigation. The year has been a bad one for internal trade, owing to the failure of the wheat crop, following on a failure in Commerce. iQOB, and owing to the continued in security in Central Persia. The effects, however, have been largely neutral ized, as far as Mohammerah and Nasiri are concerned, by the increase in transit trade due to the disturbances on the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan Road {vide ' Customs ' and ' Navigation ' supra)- This circumstance, and the advent of the Oil Company, has led several British firms now established in Basrah to consider the advisability of commencing branches here, and m articular Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., under instructions from ome, have been enquiring into the possibilities of trade here.I POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. The Managing Agents of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Messrs. Lloyd, Scott &amp; Co., also propose to enter the mercantile arena as soon as they can obtain a house, wharf, etc. The principal obstacle to both firms seems to be the very high price demanded for suitable land by the Shaikh, and the short lease which he is willing to give. Messrs. ter Meulen, Gratama &amp; Co. continued to trade on a small scale. Foreign Firms in Arabistan. their head-cjuarters being at Ahwaz: Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. were represented in Mohammerah by Herr R. Carstens until he was invalided to India in August, and died en route at Karachi. He was succeeded by Herr Sandri, a youth of 22 or 23 years of age, and later by Herr Bornstorf. The German steamers continued to run, and brought a good deal of cargo for British firms and for ter Meulen, Gratama &amp; Co. The sales of Wonckhaus &amp; Co. in Mohammerah were not large, and cannot have brought sufficient profit to cover the heavy rent charged for their wharf and offices (over £200). The ' Nusrat ' on the Lower, and the ' M'awin ' on the Upper, Karun . „ . , ^ . ran regularly throughout the year, Persian ommercia n erpnse. though less often than their competitors the ' Malamir ' and the ' Shushan.'

Herr Wassmuss, German Vice-Consul at Bushire, visited Shaikh Khazal in November, taking with him Haji than el B?rtish With Foreign Governments other Rais's son to act as interpreter. He apparently only exchanged compliments and discussed the weather, etc. It was at one time rumoured that the Shaikh had borrowed £10,000 from the Germans, and the story was told in a very circumstantial way By a native who was on board the Shaikh's yacht on the occasion of the alleged loan. No confirmation has, however, been forthcom ing, and it seems probable that the rumour was based on the fact that Haji Rais had borrowed about £2,000 from the Germans in order to complete the purchase price of some date gardens for the Shaikh. When the loan of £10,000 was made to him one of the conditions was that he should at once repay the German loan, which he did, in October. When visited, in March, by Mr. ter Meulen, and asked to support the Dutch Irrigation Concession, the Shaikh was said by Mr. ter Meulen to have refused to take cognizance of the matter in any way, or to discuss the subject. The Shaikh's relations with the Turkish Walis of Basrah have been friendly, and his old standing intimacy with the ' naqib ' of Basrah and with other important f amilies is unimpaired. His relations with the Shaikh of Kuwait remain extremely friendly, though he still apparently owes this potentate about £10,000 T. and the former frequently visits Fallahiyah, whilst, when Shaikh Mubarak was ill in Kuwait (and rumoured to be dead), Shaikh Khazal went, after a delay of some days (due to his being unable to charter a ship), with his doctor, and his usual train of 100 followers, to Kuwait to see his sick friend. In December 1909, Falah and 'Abdul Karim, sons of Saihud, asked Shaikh Khazal for permission to reside in Persian territory near Hawizeh.42 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN UULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. The Shaikh replied that there was no objection to their doing so as long as they did not create a disturbance by fighting others, or by fighting the Turks. He discouraged them from the latter course and Faiah settled down at Bisaitin near Hawizeh forthwith. 'Abdul Karim with the bulk of the tribe, however, was believed, at the end of the year, to be in Turkish territory. In June 1909, a few days after the Shaikh's arrival at Nasiri on his ^ annual visit, Shaikh Hanzal, his Shaikh Khazai's internal Administration. nephew, was arrested on a charge of con spiring to murder. Shaikh Khazal in order to usurp his place. There is a good deal of doubt as to the genuineness of the evidence upon which the charge was based, and it is widely believed that the accusation was made by Haji Seyyid Husein of Nasiri (an agent of Shaikh Khazal) in order to enable the last named to replace Hanzal by his eldest son Chasib. Haji Seyyid Husein is in fear of his life in conse quence and has made frequent attempts to get into the good graces of British Consular authorities, though, until recently, he has consistently been hostile to British interests. The attempts, mentioned elsewhere in this report, to undermine Shaikh Khazal's position as overlord of all Arab tribes in Arabistan have been un successful', and his skilful diplomacy has enabled him to retain his paramount position and even strengthen it. His attitude to the Constitutional party has been irreproachable. He lent the Sardar Assad £2,000 to enable the latter to march on Tehran, and has always been profuse in his expression of loyalty to the Constitution. Nor has he hesitated to arrange for a ' Medjliss ' in Mohammerah, in accordance with the orders received by him, but he has taken steps to ensure that all the members of the ' Medjliss ' are docile and subser vient to his orders. At the same time, however, he has avoided identifying him self with any party in the State, thus preserving unimpaired his position as ruler of a nation within a nation, the Shaikh of the Arab tribes of Arabistan. It is typical of his semi-independent attitude of aloofness from Persia and Persian affairs that he has made no attempt to cement alliances with neigh bouring tribes by marriages with other families, such as those otf the Bakhtiari Khans, the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, etc. His wives are selected from the chief families of the various Tribes under him. His late Persian wife, Jamil-es-Sultaneh, who was obtained through the mediation of Haji Rais in 1903, bore him children, but none of them lived, and the experiment is not likely to be repeated.:0r CHAPTER M. ADMINISTRATION EEPORTi FOR AHWAZ FOR THE YEAR 1909 Consular Appointments. Charge was held for the first three months of the year by Captain D. L. R. His Britannic Majesty's Consulate. IjOrillter, J. A., who proceeded On long 16 c I vg in the end of March, making over the charge of His Britannic Majesty's Consulate to Lieutenant J. G. L. Rank ing, LA., by whom it has been held throughout the remainder of the year under report. For the first three months of the year Mr. H. S. Gratama and Mr. P. ter Foreign Consniates. Meulen respectively held charge of'the posts of Consul (Trading) for the Netherlands and Russian Agent, at the end of which period the latter pro ceeded to Europe on leave, leaving Mr. H. S. Gratama in acting charge, which post he has continued to hold throughout the remainder of the year, in addition to his own post, which he has held continuously throughout the year. From the beginning of the year up to his arrest by Shaikh Khazal, on Local Authorities. * he Uth ° f the P 0st of deputy Governor of Nasin was filled by Shaikh Hanzal, nephew of Shaikh Khazal, in the discharge of the duties of which post he gave satisfaction to Europeans, Arabs and Persians alike. The cir cumstances of his arrest are reported on in the Mohammerah Consulate Ad ministration Report for 1909. From the time of Shaikh Hanzal's arrest to the time Shaikh Chasib, eldest son of Shaikh Khazal, was appointed Deputy Governor, the post was filled by Shaikh Gazban of Mamoori (near Moham merah). From the beginning of August to the end of the year Shaikh Chasib has held the post of Deputy Governor, in which capacity he has given satis faction and shown himself a strong disciplinarian. Shaikh Abdul Husein, who, while in Burma, was a naturalised British subject, filled the post of Director of us oms ' Customs, Ahwaz, up to the end of November when he went on leave, his post being filled by Mirza Hassan Khan. Shaikh Abdul Husein is well disposed to Europeans and has given British firms no cause for complaint during the year under report. He is, however, hand in glove with Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar of Mohammerah. Three separate attempts were made during the month of December to smuggle arms into Ahwaz and North Arabistan, all of which were foiled, making a total of 150 rifles captured. In view of the projected Arabistan telegraph line a survey of the exist ing line was made by Mr. J. C. Smith, Telegraphs. Assistant Superintendent, Indo-Euro pean Telegraph Department, during the months of March and April. Start ing from Bushire he proceeded to Behbehan via Bender Rig. While en route from Behbehan to Ramuz he was attacked and robbed of property valuing about 800 Tomans at a place Darra Naie in the Agha Jirri country, by men of the Agha Jirri tribe (a sub-section of the Kuhgelus) under the leader ship of Ahmed Agha. His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz at once took up the case and, before Mr. Smith left Arabistan, property to the value of nearly 300 Tomans had been recovered, with the assistance of Husein Khan, Bahmai. At the end of the year a Governor having been appointed to Behbehan, the case was reopened with a view to the punishment of the offenders and the re covery of such claim as may be outstanding. Mr. J. C. Smith visited Ahwaz, Shushtar, Dizful and Mohammerah, and surveyed the line between these towns. :u administration report of the persian gulf As is usual the Persian line has been practically useless during the win ter months, and everybody, European firms and Persians alike, look forward to the inception of a more reliable telegraph service.

Owing to the almost total closure during the year of the Bushire-Shiraz- T u „ , AU T i Ispahan Road, subsequent on distur- Lynch Road, Ahwaz-Ispahan. , fl . ' . , .. bances m connection with the grave poli tical conditions of Persia, the year 1909 has been an unprecedented one in the annals of the Lynch Road. A great majority of the Bushire-Ispahan trade has been deflected to this route, in addition to the trade which normally uses it. Early in April, at the Samsam-es-Saltaneh's request, British subjects were warned not to travel in Ispahan district, this warning also applying to the Lynch Road. During the same month the closure of this route even was trembling in the balance, owing, in His Majesty's Consul's belief, more to the desire on the part of the Samsam-es-Saltaneh, Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris, to use this road as a lever to secure the good offices of His Majesty's Legation to prevent the further advance from Khalidabad of the Royalist army, under Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakham, Bakhtiari, than to any real danger. At that time the two ruling Bakhtiari families, viz., the Ilkhani family and the Haji Ilkhani family, headed respectively by the Samsam-es-Saltaneh, Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris, and the Sardar Muhtasham, Ilbegi of Bakhtiaris, were at variance and antagonistic to each other. The Samsam practically ordered the closure of the road, first on the plea of fears that the Sardar Muhtasham would instigate robberies and create trouble on the road, and then on the plea of Kuhgelu incursions. He further refused to supply guards for His Majesty's Consul on tour via the Lynch Road to Ispahan. In order to prove the falsity of these assertions, His Majesty's Consul proceeded up to Ispahan in the end of May vii'd the Lynch Road, guards being supplied by the Sardar Muhtasham himself, who was visited, together with others of the Bakhtiari Khans, and interviewed on the subject of the road. The road was proved quite safe, and immediately on the arrival of His Majesty's Consul in Ispahan, with His Majesty's Legation's approval, the road was declared safe and the warning to the British subjects mentioned above was cancelled, since when, up to the end of the year, the road has remained open and traffic in full swing. Early in February the question was raised by the Muntazim-ed-Dowleh, Road, shares in. s0 ' of ^ late Isphandiar Khan feardar Assad, as to the possibility of selling his and Kis brother's shares in the road, which amount to J of the total. He referred the matter to Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Ispahan Agent, who referred it to London. Messrs. Lynch Brothers' AhwaZ Agent agreed with His Majesty's Consul in thinking that it was unwise that the Khans should sell their interest in the road, which opinion was concurred in by His Majesty's Legation. The matter was referred to the Foreign Office, London, and no further developments have taken place up to date. Two robberies have occurred on the Lynch Road in the year under review. Road Robberies. ^ at a place Gardan-i-Lughamgir, in June, when 35 donkeys, 10 loads almonds and some miscellaneous property were looted by the Tebi, the second at Gardan-i-Sarkhum when 50 mules and some miscellaneous property were carried off by the same tribe. This latter caravan belonged to Shushtari mer chants, while the former belonged to Messrs. Lynch Brothers.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 45 In both cases His Majesty's Consul has repeatedly asked Messrs. Lynch Brothers to inform him of the value of the property stolen, to enable him to claim compensation from the Bakhtiari Khans, but up to the present Messrs. Lynch Brothers have been unable to furnish the information required. This subject is dealt with separately Lynch Road. Condition of—Bridges, Bridge under the heading ' Messrs. Lynch tolls, Road Construction, etc. Brothers.' Although the road has not been repaired since the summer of 1907, its general condition, considering the engineering difficulties involved, is fair. Petty repairs are required in a few places, about which the Bakhtiari Khans have been informed, which repairs, however, had not been effected up to the end of the year. The Godar Bridge tolls for the year (Persian) ending 20th March 1910 have been farmed out by the Bakhtiari Khans to one Qalb Ali for a sum of 17 000 Tomans, but it is estimated that by the end of the year, a sum of about 40000 Tomans will have been taken in toils; such a large sum is unprece dented and testifies to the amount of traffic which has passed up and down the road, being roughly twice as large as the average reported actual annual takings for the three preceding years. On the 3rd March 1909 a sum of 31,000 odd Krans stood to the Bakhtiari Khans' credit with Messrs. Lynch Brothers, under the head ' Road Construc tion Account.' - T ours of H is M ajesty's C onsul.

It was originally intended to start on the 10th May, but, owing to the refusal of the Samsam-es-Saltaneh to supp y guards to His Majesty's Consul and the correspondence subsequent thereon, a start was not made till the 24th May. A few days prior to His Majesty s Consul's departure Shaikh Khazal, who was m Ahwaz at the time, requestea permission, on account of the reputed unsafety of the road, for Haji bait-ed- Dowleh, the retiring Governor of Arabistan, to accompany the Consular caravan. Permission was granted, but at the same time it was P 1 that His Majesty's Consul could accept no responsibility on the Governors account in the event of anything happening. During the whole journey through the Bakhtiari country of cara van was met with, there being no other caravans on the road with the excep tion of His Majesty's Consul's caravan and that of the ex -Governor, fr which it may be seen that the road was all but closed.

Mombi, the head-quarters of Muhammad Husein Khan, was visited on one of these expeditions, travelling by way of the Teng-i-Dolia and the Teng-i- Maghar, near the first of which Tengs on the return journey an opportunity was obtained of obtaining specimens of iron and lignite deposits which exist there. Expeditions were also made to inspect the oil' shows' at Tashun and the Sassaman remains near the Teng-i-Bend. Two days were spent at Mombi and three continuous days at Likkak. The tone of all the three brothers was most friendly and frank and, dur ing the tour, friendly relations were established, not only with the ruling Chiefs of the Bahmai, but also with Chiefs of other tribes of the Kuhgelu who were met with both at Likkak and other places in the Kuhgelu country. Three questions came up for discussion : (i) Muhammad Husein Khan's desire for an Engineer to estimate the cost of building a bridge over the Marun river on the direct road between Likkak and Behbehan, {ii) regarding the oil deposits, {Hi) regarding the Arabistan Telegraphs, (i) and (ii) have been referred to Lynch and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company respectively and (in) is held in abeyance pending the ratification by the Medjliss of the Tele graph Convention. In the latter case Ali Nakki Khan's good will is a great asset in the case of construction and maintenance of a telegraph line in that part of the coun try. Both Ali Nakki Khan's regime at Likkak and that of his brother at Mombi is purely Lurish, more so even than that of the Sardar Ashraf, Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, who was visited last year. At present the two brothers appear to administer the tribe in harmony and to be free of those dissentions which split up the Bakhtiari Khans. Muhammad Husein Khan of Mombi is even more powerful and more feared than his elder brother Ali Nakki Khan, while the youngest, Muham mad Sheffi Khan, acts for either brother as occasion may demand. Ali Nakki Khan is a middle aged man while the other two are about 35 and 25 respectively. All seem endowed with a reasonable amount of intelli gence, more especially Muhammad Husein Khan. The progeny of all three brothers are as yet children. It is hoped to make the Kuhgelu the subject of a separate report. From Likkak the march was continued to Behbehan where 2 days were spent making the acquaintance of the leading men of that town. From there the tour was continued to Ram Hormuz, and through S. W. Arabistan via Ghuraiba and Fallahiyah to Ahwaz, making a total of nearly 850 miles covered on the summer and autumn tours. Qala Madrassa. —Satisfactory pro- Claims. (a) Messrs. Lynch Brothers. gress was made in the year 1909 in the matter of old outstanding claims. The Qala Madrassa robbery claim, which had been outstanding since 1907, and which the Bakhtiari Khans had flatly refused to pay, was paid in toto after much negotiation, in August. Godar Bridge Claim—This claim has been outstanding since 1903-04 and, as in the case of other claims, the Bakhtiari Khans had refused payment, on the grounds that in their opinion it was exorbitant and that Mr. Preece, at that time His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan, had told them that he agreed with this view. After much negotiating the Khans agreed to see the details of the bill and to pay when satisfied as to the accuracy ot the details. Not having the details of the bill in Camp His Majesty's Consul wired to His Majesty's Legation asking for a copy and at the same timePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. ^ authorisation to accept liquidation of the claim without the interest super added, in case the Khans on seeing details refused payment of interest. The matter was referred to the Foreign Office and Messrs. Lynch Brothers, London Office, and authority as desired was granted, but information only arrived when His Majesty's Consul had started on tour for the Kuhgelu country and was unable to see the Bakhtiari Khans. Caftain Lorimer's robbery claim.—This claim had been outstanding since (» Misceilaneou,. the s ™ r of 1908 and, as in above cases, Knans had refused payment. Their objections were overcome however and the claim paid in toto in August. During the month of January the Engineering expert, Mr. Howard Godar Bridge. Humphreys report in connection with the Godar Bridge was received. In his opinion the defects, which have appeared in the structure of the bridge, are due to two causes, both of which appear to be subsequent on structural defects. His Majesty's Consul, while on tour, inspected the bridge and reported on its present state, at the same time requesting that the incidence for the res ponsibility of payment for the remedying of the defects might be finally estab lished prior to repairs. No answer had been received up to the end of the year under review.

In April a subsidiary agreement was arrived at with the Bakhtiari Khans Relations With Bakhtiaris. witl1 re gard to the guarding arrange- ments for the oil fields, which up to then had been most unsatisfactory. By this agreement a specified number of guards, both mounted and unmounted, were to be maintained at each oil field, the payment of whom was to be in the hands of the Company and in consider- ation of which a sum of £600 per annum was to be deducted from the annual subsidy of £2,000 paid by the Company to the Bakhtiari Khans. As a whole the Bakhtiari Khans' attitude has been friendly towards the Oil Company during the past year, and they appear to have recognised the tact that their interests lie in the smooth and uninterrupted progress of the Oil Company's affairs. During the year under report relations between His Britannic Majesty's Consulate and that of the Netherlands Foreign Interests and Activities. Political. and the Russian Consular Agency have been of the friendliest. In the month of February Mr. ter Meulen, the Russian Consular Agent, Anwaz, commenced to talk openly of a ' concession ' which the Dutch had obtained for irrigation works from the Karun river. This, however, on refer ence by His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Persian Minister or Foreign Affairs was denied and was stated to be merely a two years' option granted to the late Dutch Minister M. de Sturler. The Persian Minister for , orei £ n Affairs also asserted that the Netherlands Minister had complained flat the option granted was valueless. D ? S ■^ r ^ ann i c Majesty's Government at the same time informed the utch Government that any concession, which did not meet with the approval 0 tne Shaikh of Mohammerah or was in any way prejudicial to British in vests, would not receive our support. The principal points of this concession will be found in the appendix. tli TT^ r ^ er . Meulen was asked by Graff van Roggen, in a letter dated from ® Hague in February, to go and see the Shaikh of Mohammerah and find 1 his views on the subject. Graff van Roggen also stated that his name had ee n mentioned as Public Works Adviser to the Persian Government.48 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF In accordance with this request Mr. ter Meulen had intended to see the Shaikh of Mohammerah but was dissuaded and left Mohammerah, without do ing so, en route to Europe. In March the substance of the Netherlands Government reply to the re presentation mentioned swpra was received which was to the effect that, were the concession granted, the Syndicate involved would be warned that, without the British Government's support and the Shaikh of Mohammerah's co-oper ation, no work could be undertaken. According to a statement made by Mr. Gratama, Consul for the Nether lands, in His Majesty's Consul's presence no progress has up to date been made with the formation of a Syndicate to take up the above option. During the month of November Herr Wassmuss, the German Vice-Con- sul at Bushire, visited the site of the refinery at Abadan Island on a pre tended shooting trip and proceeded up the Karun to the Masj id Sulaiman oil field on a similar pretext. Not having obtained the permission of the Man aging Agents in Mohammerah he was given the cold shoulder at the oil field and obtained no information from the Company's employes, such informa tion as he obtained on technical matters, it is believed, he received through Mr. Gratama, the Dutch Consul. He frankly stated in Ahwaz to one of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's representatives that he had been ordered by the German Government to make a report on the oil fields. He is further reported in Ahwaz to have attempted to negotiate the lease of a house in Ahwaz through Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar in Mohammerah and to have stated the possibility of a German firm shortly opening in Ahwaz. The firm of ter Meulen, Gratama &amp; Co. are still the only local rivals of Messrs. Lynch Brothers; a small Commercial. amount of the carrying trade from Ahwaz to Ispahan has been undertaken by them, but the firm make no secret that the year under report has been anything but a prosperous one, being even worse than 1908. Local Persian merchants also complain that the conditions in Persia in 1909 have had a disastrous effect on their trade. The year opened with a serious earthquake which devastated a large tract of country in the vicinity of Silakhor, Luristan. shocks continuing to be felt at interval's up to the end of March. During the month of February two Russians travelled through the Sila khor district via the Chahar Lang Bakhtiari country towards Ispahan, osten sibly for the purpose of investigating the damage done by the earthquake, and in the month of June a Russian subject took up his residence in Burujird for commercial purposes. During the month of March news was received that the Wali of Pusht-i- Kuh had been offered the Governorship of Luristan. This he provisionally accepted subject to certain conditions, the main of which was that he should only be responsible for the payment of taxes on the old scale. The Wali however never actually took up the Governorship and, in the month of August, Saif-ud-Din Mirza was appointed to the Governorship by the new Constitutional Government. In the month of March Amanullah Khan, the Wali of Pusht -i-Kuh's eldest son, rebelled against his father and, after seeking refuge with various Lur Chiefs, who were hostile to his father, eventually fled to Mandali and sought the assistance of the Turks, in return for which Amanullah Khan pro mised, if successful, to hand over the lands of Gunjian Cham, which for some time past have been a bone of contention between the Wali and the Turks. This assistance was given, and Amanullah Khan made a raid on his father's land near Gunjian Cham, but was worsted in the fighting which en sued, and retired to Badrai. Shortly afterwards Amanullah Khan made his peace with his father through the agency of other of the Lur Chiefs, and on his return was put m charge of a few tribes to administer and draw revenue from.political residency for 1909. 49 In connection with his son s rebellion the ali obtained an opportunity of attacking and defeating a section of the Sagwands. These he moved en masse from their usual habitat to the neighbourhood of Deh Luran and later to Tarhun. The object of this move was to remove them from a place where they could always rob and plunder to a place among his own tribes where they would have to turn their energies to more peaceful pursuits. During the early part of the year constant raids were taking place be tween the Wali and Nazr Ali Khan, Fath-es-Sultan; later in the summer peace was made between them, and their joint forces made a raid on Mandali, as a reprisal for the assistance given by the Turks to the Wali's son. This peace was however shortlived and, early in November, the Wali of Pusht -i-Kuh, assisted by his brother Ali Riza Khan, Shahab-ed-Dowleh, at tacked the Fath-es-Sultan and, after some heavy fighting, utterly defeated him. The Fath-es-Sultan himself escaped and took refuge in Silakhor, but, on failing to raise a force to retrieve his shattered fortunes, tendered his submission to the Wali, who settled him with a small following in Tarhun. Late in the year Shaikh Khazal, Shaikh of Mohammerah, wrote to the Sardar Ashraf, Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, asking him to send a trustworthy con fidential dependent to talk over the subject of an alliance. The Wali wrote to one of his Chiefs, Qaid Khani, summoning him prior to despatching him to Mohammerah, En route to Gawe, the Wali's winter head-quarters, this Chief was wounded in a raid and returned to his home and up to the present no further steps have been taken in the matter. Towards the end of the year another question besides that of the owner ship of the lands of Gunjian Cham arose between the Wali and the Turks This was a question of water rights rendered acute by the completion of a canal by the Wali, which takes ofi from the Ab-i-Gunjian Cham, thereby lessening the quantity of water which reaches Mandali. Up to the end of the period under review however no active steps had been taken by either side, to enforce what they considered to be their respective rights. Sanction having been obtained in December for the appointment of an Agent in Khurramabad, Mirza Ali Akbar, who hitherto had been unpaid ' news-writer ' to this Consulate in Burujird, was formally appointed, with effect from the 1st April 1910 (or from date of arrival in Khurramabad if after that date) on an annual salary of R300. Bakhtiaris. With the exception of January 1909 (and December 1908) the Hkhani- ship has, throughout the year, been held Internal relations and their bearing on the Naif Kuli Khan, Samsam-es- National movement. Saltaneh; while the Ilbegiship has, throughout the year, been held by Ghulam Husein Khan, Sardar Muhtasham. Succinctly the causes which led to the Sainsam-es -Saltaneh's temporary depcsal from the Ilkhaniship and his subsequent espousal of the Nationalist cause and march on Ispahan were as follows :— Haji Khusro Khan, Sardar Zaffar, having gone to Tehran in the summer of 1908, returned in the late autumn to the Bakhtiari country to raise tres forces in aid of the Shah. The Samsam-es-Saltaneh ha y n g the raising of this contingent, Haji Khusro Khan and others o e tiari Khans of the Haii Ilkhani family determined to bring about his down fall. With this end in view intrigues were set on foot m Tehran ' T come of which was that, at the end of December, the Shah deposed Najt Kuli Khan, Samsam-es-Saltaneh, and declared that his lands and prop ^ , forfeited to his opponents. An attempt was made, but without any signa success, to wrest his local authority from him at Ramuz. Soe^g that t tide had apparently turned against him, and, being afraid o u u . ments, the Samsam-es-Saltaneh put himself into c0 ™ munica t 10n .^^ h . 5 Nejafi and Agha Nurullah, powerful Mullas in Ispahan, saying , embraced the Nationalist cause and was willing to come and take Ispaha behalf of the Nationalists from the Royalist Governor, Iqbal -ed-Dowleh.60 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF This move proved successful, and resulted in the people of Ispahan in viting him to come and take Ispahan, which he did early in January, with the assistance of Abdul Kasim Khan and his father Ibrahim Khan, Zergham-es- Saltaneh of the family of Biza Kuli Khan, who for the last 15 years had been ' out of the coach' as far as Bakhtiari affairs were concerned. Very slight resistance was offered, the Governor took ' bast' (refuge) in the British Consulate-General and Najf Kuli Khan, Samsam-es-Saltaneh, established himself as Governor of Ispahan. This was the first of the Bakhtiari moves, which ultimately culminated in the taking of Tehran and the deposal of Muhammad Ali Shah. Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Sardar Assad, accompanied by Murtaza Kuli Khan, the eldest son of the Samsam-es-Saltaneh, arrived in Mohammerah, in the end of March, and proceeded to Malamir en route to Ispahan, where he arrived early in May. While at Malamir, Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Sardar Assad, called a meeting of the Bakhtiari Khans, the outcome of which was an agreement between the two families to stand by each other and espouse the Nationalist cause, one of the signatories of which agreement was Ghulam Husein Khan, Sardar Muhtasham. Subsequent on this agreement Ghulam Husein Khan, Sardar Muhta sham, raised a force to accompany the Sardar Assad, but, owing to a quarrel, temporarily seceded from the Nationalist cause, returned to Ardal, his head quarters, and sent the force so raised to the assistance of his brother Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakham, a supporter of the Royalist cause, who was at that time incamped with a Royalist force at Khalidabad, 64 miles north of Ispahan, About two months later, the agreement, above-mentioned, was ratified at Dastena, and Ghulam Husein Khan, Sardar Muhtasham, finally threw in his lot with the other Bakhtiari Khans who had espoused the Nation alist cause. On the secession of Ghulam Husein Khan, Sardar Muhtasham, and the arrival of Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Sa^dar Assad, at Ispahan, Najf Kuli Khan, Samsam-es-Saltaneh, telegraphed to Shaikh Khazal, Shaikh of Mohammerah, that a split had occurred between the Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani families of Bakhtiaris^ in reply to which Shaikh Khazal both telegraphically and through His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz offered to act as intermediary be tween the two families, in accordance with the agreement made in 1908 be tween the Bakhtiaris and Shaikh Khazal. Circumstances decreed however that his mediation was not necessary, though later, in the summer, his assistance was. sought for the Nationalist cause and given in the shape of a loan of 12,000 tomans. After much vacillation on the part of the Bakhtiari Khans, Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Sardar Assad, decided, towards the end of June, to make the final move which resulted, after the junction of the Bakhtiari forces with those of the Sipahdar Reshti, in the capture of Tehran and the deposition of Muhammad Ali Shah on the 13th July. As the circumstances of the march on, and capture of, Tehran are outside the purview of this Consulate, the matter is not touched on, though a few facts regarding the Bakhtiari forces engaged on the Nationalist side may be of interest. It is estimated that no more than 2,500 cavalry and infantry were en gaged in the final movement on Tehran, the chief Khans who took part in the advance being Sardar Assad, Sardar Muhtasham and Sardar Bahadur, Salar-i-Heshmat and Abdul Kasim Khan. Though it is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of the Bakhtiari casualties in the fighting which ensued, it is probable that the number did not exceed 50. The paucity of casualties can only be attributed to the fact that, as far as possible, the Bakhtiaris avoided doing each other much damage when they came into collision, together with the fact that, at anything ex cept point-blank ranges, their marksmanship is most inferior. Among the Khans of any note who were killed were Assadullah Khan, brother of the Zergham-es-Saltaneh, Azezullah Khan, son-in-law of thePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 51 Samsam-es -Saltaneh, and Kasim Khan, maternal uncle of the Sardar Muhta- sham. Relations with the British. During the past year there has been a mafked improvement in the tone of the Bakhtiaris towards British interests. As regards the Oil Company, it is probable that the Khans tardily recog nise the fact that their interests are bound up in the smooth working of the Company's affairs. As regards Messrs. Lynch Brothers, both the Sardar Assad and the Samsam-es-Saltaneh, on more than one occasion, expressed to His Majesty's Consul their deep sense of gratitude and obligation to Mr. H. B. Lynch, not only for the financial assistance rendered to the Sardar Assad during his recent tour in Europe, but also for ' the assistance rendered to the Nationalist Cause in the British Parliament. 5 It is greatly to be hoped that Messrs. Lynch Brothers will do their utmost to augment this feeling and cultivate friendlier relations with the Bakhtiari Khans in the future than have held in the past. During His Majesty's Consul's visit to the Sardar Muhtasham at Ardal the latter put forward a request to be taken under British protection and for a guarantee for the safety of his life and property. A feeling also appeared to be gaining ground among others of the Bakh tiari Khans that the British had lost that feeling of interest with which they were wont in former years to regard the Bakhtiaris. In view of these circumstances His Majesty's Consul referred the matter to His Majesty's Legation and suggested that some renewal of our expression of friendly interest in their welfare be given to the Khans of both families. The question was referred to the Foreign Office, London, and in December an answer was received that an assurance in this form be given to the Sardars Assad and Muhtasham. Other questions dealt with both at Ardal and Ispahan were those of out- Standing claims and the then condition of the Lynch Road. Regarding the first, the result of these interviews and others with the Sardar-es-Zaffar at Junaghun and the Samsam-es-Saltaneh have been dealt with under the heading ' Claims.' Regarding the second, the Sardar Muhtasham and Samsam-es-Saltaneh both promised to take steps to prevent its closure, with the result that the road remained open till the end of the period under review. Various new titles were granted to the Bakhtiari Khans during the year 1909. In the month of April the Agha Jerri, a sub-tribe of the Kuhgelus, at- tacked and robbed Mr. J. C. Smith of u geus ' the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment as has been separately reported on under the heading ' Telegraphs.' Early in May the Bahmai Kuhgelus collected a force at the request of Yusuf Khan, Salar-i-Heshamt (now Amif-i-Mujahid) under the command of Muhammad Sheffi Khan to proceed to Ispahan for the assistance of the Ilkhani family of the Bakhtiaris. This force however never left Kuhgelu country, the Amir-i-Mujahid having countermanded his order a;t the last minute. In the month of September information was received from His Majesty's Legation that the Kuhgelu tribes had been handed over to the Bakhtiaris and, early in December, Ilyas Khan, Sarum-ul-Mulk, son of Haji Khusro Khan, Sardar-es-Zaffar, arrived in Behbehan to take up the Governorship. His first act on assuming his duties W'ais to imprison and despoil Mirza Ali Riza Khan, Bahadur-i-Diwan, who for some time past has been Acting Governor of Behbehan. Mirza Ali Riza Khan had strong tendencies to reactionary policy and thus afforded a pretext on which the Bakhtiari Governor im prisoned him, though in reality it is supposed that the action was prompted by the Shaikh-ul -1 slam and Husein Khan Bahmai who had gone to Ram Hormuz to escort the Governor into Behbehan. These two men had a long standing fend with the Bahadur-i-Diwan and made the best of the oppor tunity afforded them.52 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Ilyas Khan, being of the Ilkhani family of Bakhtiaris, is to be assisted in his Governorship, by Fath Ali Khan, Salar-i-Muiyid, son of the Amir-i- MufEakham, on behalf of the Haji Ilkhani family. Fath Ali Khan arrived in Ram Hormuz on the 2nd January 1910 en route to join his colleague in Behbehan. After his arrival in Behbehan the Governor commenced collecting a force with a view to subjugating the Tebi and B /r Ahmad Kuhgelus, in which task he is being assisted by the Bahmai Kuhgelus, but up to the end of the year no move had been made. Inter-tribal fighting has been continuous throughout the year among the Kuhgelus, notably towards the end of the year between the Lirawi and the Agha Jerris of Zeitun, and between two sections of the Sarhaddi Tebis under Khan Ali Khan and Ali Murad Khan respectively. The fact of His Majesty's Consul's tour in the Kuhgelu country in the autumn has been elsewhere noted under the heading of ' Tours of His Majesty's Consul.' Hitherto the Kuhgelu country had practically been a £ terra incognila' both politically and geographically, never having been previously visited by any of His Majesty's Representatives at Ahwaz. Friendly relations having been established with various of the Kuhgelu Chiefs it is hoped that, besides the direct results of such friendship, this will have a good effect on the minds of the Bakhtiari Khans, who have hitherto felt themselves to be in the posi tion of monopoly holders both as regards oil deposits and communications between Arabistan and Central Persia. The charge of the Consulate dispensary has been held throughout the Medical year by Civil Hospital Assistant Fazal Ilahi who has discharged his duties with a high degree of efficiency. The head-quarters dispensary was closed from the 24th May to 26th November, as the Hospital Assistant accompanied His Majesty's Consul on tour, during which time medical work was done in the districts passed through. The daily average attendance at the dispensary for the period during which it was open at head-quarters during the year 1909 was 93-39 as against 92-02 for the preceding year, 67 operations having been performed during the year under report as against 49 the preceding year. The daily average number of patients treated on tour was 12-08. It is impossible to form any comparison with previous year's medical work on tour as no statistics were kept. Eye diseases and malarial fever are the diseases most commonly met with both in Arabistan and among the hill tribes, while those which appeared in epidemic ^orm in head-quarters were small-pox in the spring and malaria and dysentery in the autumn and winter months. It is interesting to note that this is the first epidemic of malaria which has occurred in the Ahwaz district since the opening of the dispensary when records commenced to be kept. The general health of the Consulate staff has been good during the year under report. The only official visitor was Herr Wassmuss, the German Vice-Consul Visitorg at Bushire, the circumstances of whose visit have been mentioned swpra under the heading ' Foreign Interests and Activities.' Owing to the closure of the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan Road, Mr. B. Temple, correspondent for the ' Pioneer ' and ' Civil and Military Gazette,' travelled up to Ispahan via the Lynch Road in May-June, visiting the Masj id Sulaiman oil-fields en route. To prevent misapprehension and misstatements he was carefully informed as regards Bakhtiari affairs. Mr. Pearson, of the Carnegie Institute, Washington, accompanied by a Greek interpreter, visited Ahwaz and Shushtar in the month of May in connection with the Magnetic Survey of Persia.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 53 Two naval officers, Paymaster Adams and Lieutenant Smithies, both of H. M. S- '* Sphinx,' passed through Ahwaz in April en route to Europe, visiting en route Shushtar and the oil-fields. In connection with these two officers' journey to Shushtar an incident occurred which is dealt with under the heading ' Miscellaneous—Protec tion of British lives and property in Arabistan.' Mr- N. Worrall, Consular Assistant, accompanied by his wife, passed through the district on transfer from Tehran to Bushire.

(with, Constitutional Institutions. The progress of Constitutionalism among the town-dwellers of Arabistan is dealt with in the Mohammerah Consulate Administration Report. Up to the arrival of the Bakhtiari Governor in Behbehan Constitutional Institutions were non-existent, owing to the opposition of the Bahadur-i- Diwan, who was an ardent reactionary at heart. Moreover the townspeople of Behbehan themselves are divided into Constitutionalists and Reactionaries, and even those who favour the Medjliss are ignorant of the very elements of Constitutional Government and Insti tutions. On his arrival the Governor of Behbehan took up the subject 6'f Constitutional representation but, up to the end of the year, his efforts had failed to produce any results. Miscellaneous. The question of the incidence of responsibility for the protection of British lives and property in Arabistan Protection of British lives and property in arose in April in the following form and Arablstan ' iwith the following result~ Paymaster Adams, R.N., and Lieutenant Smithies, R.N., desired to proceed to Shushtar by caravan, and on His Majesty's Consul requesting Shaikh Hanzal, the then Deputy Governor of Ahwaz, to supply the neces sary guards, Shaikh Hanzal refused to supply guards or to accept respon sibility for the safety of these officers further than Bend-i-Kir, a place 16 miles north of Ahwaz. To this His Majesty's Consul replied informing Shaikh Hanzal that he had received no official intimation of the change of responsibility and con tinued to hold him responsible. At the same time reference was made to the Shaikh of Mohammerah, who replied by sending orders to Shaikh Hanzal to the effect that British lives and property were to be protected. Owing to the failure of the rains in 1909, and subsequent on the drought of 1908, crops were very scanty and no Crops - wheat was available for export. Con sequent on the same cause barley and cropped straw were most difficult to obtain and the price of food stuffs and fodder was extremely high, grains and food stuffs being 40 per cent, and tibbin 50 per cent, above normal. Another cause which has conduced to the rise of prices of cereals is that the prices in Arabistan respond sympathetically to the prices obtaining in London which have risen considerably during the last few years. The rainfall was 7 inches 17 cents. Maximum temperature 117° on 3rd August.

Holland, I.C.S., and Captain Norman Scott, I.M.S., held the mt „ A n t , appointments of Political Agent and Tiie o i ica gency an onsu a e. Agency Surgeon, respectively, through out the year. Major P. Z. Cox, C.SJ., C.I.E., Political Resident at Bushire, arrived at Maskat on February 11th in R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence-' The usual official visits were exchanged. On April 3rd, a small lighthouse committee consisting of Commander Litchfield, R.N., Commander Beauchamp, R.I.M., and Mr. Hood accompanied by Captain Trevor, I.A., First Assistant to the Political Resident, Bushire, visited Maskat in R. I. M- S. ' Lawrence ' to discuss the question of the best site for a lighthouse, supposing it were decided to erect one. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India was pleased to confer the title of Khan Sahib as a personal distinction on Seyyid Muham mad-bin-Said, lately officiating Dragoman of the Agency. A Darbar was held at the Agency on September 9th by the Political Agent for the purpose of presenting the Sanad of the title to Seyyid Muhammad. On the evening of October 15th, it was noticed that smoke was issuing from a stack of coal outside one of the coal godowns at the Depot. Prompt measures were taken to clear away the coal and to pour water on the stack and by the evening of October 16th all danger of combustion was over. Sanction has been granted for the construction of new lines for the Political Agent's escort at a cost of R20,000. The work is to be commenced after the close orf the financial year. His Highness the Sultan has enjoyed fairly good health during the year, „ but he has been subject to occasional Highness the Sultim - attacks of fever. His Highness' cousin, Seyyid Ali-bin-Salim, left for Zanzibar on a visit on January 6th. He returned on September 26th. His Highness the Sultan proceeded to Sib on March 16th, accompanied by his sons, Seyyids Nadir and Muhammad. His Highness returned tc Maskat on April 29th. His Highness again went to Sib on October 15th and returned on October 28th. Habib-bin-Sulayim, the individual mentioned in last year's report, arrived from Mombassa, on April 24th, in the ' Nur-ul-Bahar.' He brought a motor-boat for His Highness. Seyyid Taimur, His Highness' eldest son, left for India on September 15th. He returned on October 25th after a stay in Karachi and Bombay. On November 20th His Highness' two sons, Seyyids Nadir and Muham mad, were betrothed, respectively, to the daughters of Ali-bin-Salim. His Highness accompanied by Seyyids Nadir and Ali-bin-Salim went to Iti on December 23rd. The usual inter-tribal feuds continued throughout the year and many persons were murdered. The As Siabiyin.—On the night of April 18th, while His Highness the Sultan was staying in the fort at Nakhl, Events in His Highness' territories. t J lree 0 f His Highness' - followers Were treacherously shot in their sleep by men of the As Siabiyin tribe. The rnU1 *' derers fled. His Highness returned at once to Sib and collected men ana56 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF supplies with a view to hostilities against the offending tribe. On May loth, Seyyids Taimur and Nadir with a punitive force entered Nafah, the country of the As Siabiyin. They destroyed the latter's forts and returned to Bidbid. The operations were finally closed by the surrender of three Shaikhs of the As Siabiyin, who were despatched to Maskat and confined in the fort by His Highness the Sultan. Maskat. —His Highness' telephone line was extended to Sib in February, a distance of about 25 miles from Mutrah. In March the local American Missionaries made arrangements for taking a house in Mutrah and for opening a dispensary there without first obtain ing the sanction of His Highness the Sultan. His Highness was unfavour ably disposed towards the undertaking for administrative reasons, and desired the American Consul to represent his objections to the United States Govern ment. The matter is still under discussion but, in the meanwhile, the Ameri can Missionaries are continuing their medical work. On February 6th a public meeting was held by His Highness the Sultan for the purpose of collecting subscriptions for the construction of a new hospital. His Highness headed the subscription list with a donation of R11,500 on behalf of himself, his brother and his family, and the local com munity, Europeans, Arabs and Indians, subscribed R26,000. A site was provided free of cost by some Oman subjects resident in Zanzibar. The total sum required was completed by donations of Ei20,00D from the Government of India and R2,000 from the Admiralty- The work was commenced in August and the foundation stone was laid on November 29th. At the moment of writing, the building is well on its way towards completion. Sur. —In February, His Highness the Sultan received intelligence that a dhow named ' El Kadra belonging to an Arab residing at Sur, had been seized by Italians at Hafun on the coast of Italian Somaliland on the ground that it was employed in smuggling arms from Maskat to the Somali Coast. The Nakhoda of the dhow, by name Mobarak-bin-Khamis, arrived in Maskat in March and stated that on his arrival at Hafun the Italians searched the dhow but had found only one old rifle on board. They nevertheless confiscated the dhow, despatched the passengers, 174 in number, to Mombassa in another boat, and detained Mobarak himself at Hafun for one month and eighteen days. The Nakhoda also stated that when the Italian officer boarded the dhow he seized and destroyed the Oman flag which she carried. The Nakhoda was in possession of a license granted by His Highness the Sultan and countersigned by the Political Agent of Maskat, authorising him to carry five rifles for protection. He had, however, ordered all the rifles to be landed at Sur, before leaving Oman territory, and the single rifle found concealed on board had been retained surreptitiously by one of the crew. Shortly after wards, information reached Maskat to the effect that the Italian authorities had confiscated the flags of about thirty Maskat vessels at Hafun and had captured a second dhow. His Highness the Sultian was greatly annoyed at , the action of the Italian authorities and requested His Majesty's Government to assist him in securing reparation for the insult to his flag and compensa tion for the losses suffered by the Nakhoda. The matter is still under discus sion between His Majesty's Government and the Italian Government. The management of His Highness' Customs continued to be inefficient and unsatisfactory. His Highness is now deeply in debt and is often hard pressed to find Sultan's Finances. ^ ™ rrent , ^P^eS- T he ^ pedition against the As Siabiyin was very costly and large sums have probably been spent for placating the tribes of the interior. The following table, compiled from Appendices I—IV to this report, Arms Traffic shows the number of cases of arms and ammunition imported into Maskat byPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 57 ships flying British, German and Russian flags between January 1st and December 31st, 1909 :— numbeb of cases.

T otal 1,469 27 5,198 8 According to information procured from His Highness' Customs the total number of rifles imported was 43,155 and the average number of rifles in a case was therefore 29-38. The figures for the nine months covered by last year's Administration Report were:— N umbbb op cases. Rifles. Revolvers. Ammunition. Percussion caps. 1,782 15 5,303 10 and the total number of rifles imported during the period was so that there has been a considerable falling off in imports. It is dimcuit to say with certainty to what reason the decrease is due. Local reports attri bute it to the apprehension which was aroused as to the probable result ot the Brussels Arms Conference. Possibly, the severe illness and eventual death, on October 16th, of Monsieur Goguyer, the notorious arms merchant, may have had something to do with it. Possibly also the local market was rather overstocked. • -n u Export to Mekran Coast.—From Appendix V to this report it will be seen that 27,786 rifles, 1,774,600 rounds of ammunition and 300 pistols are known to have been exported to the Mekran Coast. It is probable that many more pistols were exported than have been accounted for. Large quan i les of arms and ammunition were exported to Katr, Bahrain, Kuwait an Persia, but no reliable figures can be procured regarding these. Exports to Somaliland were insignificant. Captures—Yxom Appendix VI it will be seen the^captures made by His Majesty's ships during the year acoountedfor 6 897nflesand82o,400 rounds of ammunition. The captures effected by H. M. S.'

The Political Agent and the Agency Surgeon went on tour to Sib, by Tourg sea, in the latter part of March. The Agency Surgeon remained there for some weeks and opened a temporary dispensary. The Political Agent re mained four days and returned to Mutrah by land. On April 5th the Politi cal Agent again went to Sib, by sea, and thence travelled by land with Seyyid Nadir to Beyt-el-Felej, Nakhl, Halban, Semayil, Ghobar and Bosher return ing to Mutrah on April 10th. On April 14th the Political Agent went to Sur in H- M. S. ' Redbreast ' and returned to Maskat on April 16th. The Political Agent left Maskat for Karachi on June 2nd, and returned to Maskat on August 2nd. The Agency Surgeon left Maskat for Karachi on September 15th and returned on October 11th. The Political Agent and the Agency Surgeon went to Sur and Khor Jarama in His Highness' yacht on October 21st and returned to Maskat on October 23rd. During the year 1909, 34 slaves applied to be freed. Of these 20 were Slave Trade. Mekranis and 14 Africans. Sixteen . . .

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE TRUCIAL COAST OF OMAN FOR THE YEAR 1909. The well-beings of the Trucial Coast is entirely dependent on the pros perity of the pearl fishery, and happily the straitened financial conditions which prevailed last year were dispelled by the incidence of a successful fishery and improved market this season. Moreover no serious dissensions among the Chiefs of the maritime tribes occurred during 1909 to mar the generally satisfactory situation. The chief event of the year, from the local point of view, was the death of the Shaikh of Abu Thabi, Zaid-bin-Khalifah, on the 19th of May. This venerable Chief had been the doyen of the Trucial Chiefs for many years and at the time of his death must have been close on 90 years of age. For the last few years his faculties had been failing and he had become somewhat tiresome and fractious to deal with both in his relations with the Residency and the other Trucial Chiefs, who probably regard it as a not unmitigated evil that Shaikh Zaid has been gathered to his fathers. He was succeeded by his second son. Shaikh Tahnoon-bin-Zaid. The latter is unffortunately a confirmed invalid, having practically lost the use of his lower limbs from some form of paralysis. It is therefore the more creditable to him to have been designated by his father and brothers as successor to the jShaikhdom. His succession has been recognised by the Government of India in the usual way. The familiar Taona' case came into evidence again during the year, one of the three brothers credited with the murders, ' Gaithoo ' by name, having been captured on the pearl banks by H- M. S. ' Redbreast.' ^ The pirate violently resisted capture by the boarding party from His Majesty's ship, and it was only after being stunned by a blow from the butt-end of Lieutenant Blackman's revolver that he ceased to give trouble- The new Chief of Abu Thabi having demurred to undertaking the responsibility of the pirate's custody pending an attempt to catch his brothers, Gaithoo has been consigned to durance in the Bahrain Agency until further orders. The Abu Musa dispute continues to pursue its deliberate course, but it is understood that just before the close Shargal1 - of the year, the German rejoinder to the British arguments of July 1908 was received in London. In February a definite application was made by Messrs. Strick for a sample consignment of 400 tons of Abu Musa oxide urgently at 15^. 6c?. per ton; and on the understanding that the settlement of the German case would not be prejudiced and that no oxide be handled on which Messrs. Wonckhaus could claim any rights, the shipment was allowed by His Majesty s Govern ment and arrangements made for the mining of the aforesaid consignment. Dr. Listemann, German Consul at Bushire, who must have heard all about the transaction, took no exception to it, but Herr Wassmuss, who relieved him on his departure on furlough, protested against the shipment on the ground that the excavation of fresh oxide was an encroachment on the rights of Messrs. Wonckhaus. The Resident was instructed to take no notice of his protest and the shipment was eventually made. Subsequently, in August, the German Consulate requested permission to remove to the beach for shipment a further quantity of the oxide already mined. In reporting his agreement to the shipment under the standing instructions of His Majesty's Government, the Resident pointed out that the German Government were protesting at the mining of the fresh oxide for Messrs. Strick while still claiming to go on, removing oxide themselves whenever they pleased; that they were thus receiving preferential treatment68 administration report of the persian gulp political residency for 1909. and would be in no hurry to come to a settlement as long as these conditions continued. His Majesty's Foreign Office accordingly informed the German Government that we could not consent to the present situation being protracted indefinitely and proposed an arrangement under which the island would now be sterilized pending the settlement of the case. .There the question remained up to the end of the year. In April a report was received that the employes of the Moin-ut-Tujjar, after operating on the Farur Island, had excavated about 100 tons of oxide on Sirri Island, the ownership of which is in dispute, being claiimed by the Shaikh of Shargah as well as by the Persian Government. His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, addressed the Persian Government requesting that measures, be taken to stop the Moin from further operations in Sirri, and in the result the Moin undertook to desist from further mining in the island. P. Z. COX, Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf-CHAPTER X. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR BAHRAIN FOR THE YEAR 1909. Perhaps the most important incident of the year was the writing of a Political. letter by Shaikh Esa to the Political . , „ . Agent to the effect that he desired the British brovernment to exeroise jurisdiction over foreigners. Although in practice this was no new departure, yet such general jurisdiction had not been lormaily arranged. &gt; « rr A n ^' arc ^ ^ report was received that the Turks had annexed the island Zakhnuniyah, which belongs to the Chief of Bahrain and is used exten- sively by the Dowasir tribe as a fishing head-quarters in the winter months. The island is practically a desert and cannot well be inhabited during the hot weather. A fort was built on the island by Shaikh Ali, the father of the present Shaikh of Bahrain, but it is now in ruins. The Political Agent visited the island in April and found that the report of the Turkish attempt ing to annex it was correct, and they had actually hoisted their fla^ on the old flagstaff. Later on some Turkish soldiers were sent there but were involved in difficulties with the Bedouin who wished to steal their rifles. Representations as regards the soldiers and the flag were made to the Porte and the troops were withdrawn, after they had built a small house and had repaired the platform of the flagstaff. When the Dowasir went again to take up their winter quarters, early in November 1909, it was reported that a few Turkish soldiers were there, but that they left shortly after. As the Porte had assured His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople that the Wali of Basrah had issued orders, in June, for the withdrawal of the soldiers to Ojair, it would appear that either this was never actually done or else the orders must have been lost owing to the frequent changes of Walis and Mutassarifs. Shaikh Esa was exceedingly pleased by the honour conferred on him and his eldest son, in that his salute was increased from 5 to 11 guns on official visits to British men-of-war, and a salute of 3 guns was granted to his eldest son Shaikh Hamad when paying an official call in place of his father. No opportunity has yet occurred to permit of the salute being fired as the only m8n-of-war that have come to the port have not stayed long enough for any visits between the Commanders and Shaikh Esa. A sign of the good feeling at present existing in the island was demon strated by Shaikh Esa and many of the leading merchants respectively send ing telegrams of congratulation to His Majesty the King on the occasion of his birthday. I believe that this is the first time an event of this description has occurred in the annals of Bahrain. Shaikh Jasim-bin-Xhani, Chief of Katr, came to Bahrain on the 10th November and stayed for ten days. Fie was naturally the guest of Shaikh Esa, but the latter did not accord the generous hospitality usual among Arab Chiefs, and did not appear to do more for the honour of his guest than was absolutely necessary. For instance, he had no one to meet him on arrival though the date was well known : the house he appointed for Shaikh Jasim was not the best available. Other lesser instances of ignorance of ' savoir faire ' were also evidenced, and this negligence was perhaps the more extra ordinary as Shaikh Jasim had not visited Bahrain for some seventeen years. The Political Agent was fortunate enough to be present at the time of Shaikh Jasim's arrival at Shaikh Esa's house, and the meeting between the two old Chiefs, aged respectively 62 a^d 87, was well worth witnessing. Shaikh Esa's manner was not very cordial, and he appeared less at ease than did Shaikh Jasim, who is a much more imposing personage. The want of70 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP cordiality may possibly have been due to the fact that Shaikh Jasim had come over with the intention of persuading Shaikh Esa to take Some R20,000 out of Shaikh Mujbil Adh Dhakair, a leading Bahrain merchant. I am glad to record that Shaikh Esa did not give way in the matter, as the alleged debt was only one transaction of a series whose account and final settlement had long since been made up. Shaikh Jasim probably believed in the validity of the claim as he is a man who can only see one side of an argument and, once he has made up his mind as to the rights {sic) of a case, he can by no means be induced to see the arguments of the other party. The relations between the Political Agent and the Chief and his family were distinctly cordial. Little trouble has occurred with any of the Shaikh's officials. In June the second Shiah Qazi of Manama took upon himself to beat a Persian. As this was arrogating a jurisdiction that he did not possess, and as serious trouble in recent years has occurred in Bahrain from undue interference with foreigners, the Political Agent represented the matter to Shaikh Esa who took a small fine from the Qazi and sent him to the Agency to apologize. The Bazaar Master of Muharraq imprisoned a foreigner in September for two or three days, and when this came under observation pretended he was ignorant of the man's status. The Shaikh again supported the Political Agent and a small fine was recovered. The same Bazaar Master failed to meet and escort the Political Agent on his arri val in Muharraq to Shaikh Esa's house on the occasion of his first visit, although this had long been customary. An objection was taken and this omission has not occurred since. It is needless to say that both Bazaar Masters require a great deal of urging to keep up to the mark in the per formance of their duties, but an effectual goad has been utilised when they Soecome too negligent, viz., payment to the Shaikh instead of to them a portion of the 10 per cent. Khidmah levied on civil suits. One thousand two hundred and sixty-six civil and three hundred and ten criminal cases were disposed of during the year. This shows a consider able decrease in civil cases as the previous report only embraced nine months. I think the reasons for the decrease are solely attributable to the fact that the pearling season was a good one and there were accordingly fewer people trying to escape payment of their claims. During the year further progress was made with cases between Boat Masters (Nakhodas) and their divers, and the Salifa Judge has now a little Court of his own whereas formerly he used to hear cases in a coffee shop. The Nakhodas are still very averse to bringing their books, and it will still take some time to bring matters on a really satisfactory basis. The general health of the public during the year under consideratiun was fairly good. The prevailing diseases were malaria, rheumatism, ulcers, conjunctivitis and bronchitis. There was also a small outbreak of plague in May 1909. The epidemic lasted for about forty-seven days, but did not take any serious turn owing to the prevailing high temperature at the time (85° to 90° mean average). The total mortality estimated on the most reliable sources was 29 for the town of Manama, but about an equal number of deaths are reported to have occurred in the island of Muharraq. There was a noticeable mortality among rats before the appearance of the first case as in the previous epidemics. The working of the Victoria Memorial Hospital during the year 1909 was very satisfactory as the following statistics will show :— Y ear. Indoor. Outdoor. Total. 1907 ...... 11 2,381 2,392 1908 108 4,409 4,517 1909 . 98 4,876 4,974POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 71 It will be seen from the above figures that the total number of patients doubled within two years. The hospital is popular, being freely attended by all castes and communi ties, including people from the districts of Katr and Katif. I think it is only fair to add that the popularity of the hospital has been greatly due to the trouble Assistant Surgeon Dr. Monand has taken with his patients combined with his general tact. He is a great favourite of the in habitants. The Chief of Bahrain and several other members of the A1 Khalifa family sought advice and treatment from the Assistant Surgeon. Plans for quarantine buildings have now been marked out on the site selected and materials for building have been collected. The period under report has been a decidedly successful one for Bahrain General largely owing to the fact that the value of pearls was at one time nearly double what they had been in the previous year, and throughout the busy season the prices continued very firm. The date crop was also above the average, and there has accordingly been a year of considerable prosperity for all classes. The year has been quiet. The pearling season opened on the 10th May and closed on the 31st August. After Ramzan, during which month it is unlawful for a Muhammadan to dive, many boats went out for about 30 days. The Customs Administration under the management of Gangaram Tikamdas has worked smoothly and is increasing in efficiency as it discovers various tricks of the local importers. Owing to the improved trade it is pro bable that the receipts to the Shaikh on this account must have been about 3 lakhs. i The Shaikh and his three sons resided in Muharraq, except for about four tit x . ou -i t . j t . i months in the hot weather when they Movements of Shaikh and Family. J ^ oi i -r&gt; t • came over to Manama, Shaikh Esa living in the old fort at the back of the town. Shaikh Hamad and Abdullah paid two brief visits to Katif for hawking, and Shaikh Muhammad went to Lingah for the same purpose. Shaikh Hamad and Abdullah left Bahrain with 95 followers for a sport ing expedition in Kuwait territory. They arrived at Kuwait on the 2nd December and were met by a grandson of Shaikh Mobarak. They finally worked their way down to Kasr as Sabaih hawking and hunting and return ed to Bahrain in Shaikh Mobarak's steam launch. The latter gave them and their followers presents to the value of some 4,000 dollars. The rainfall in the spring amounted 6 ' to 80 cents, and in the autumn to 3*84 inches, which is satisfactory. One day in December 1-65 inches fell, which is quite exceptional for Bahrain. The result was that much damage was done and every house leaked badly owing to the system of mud roofs. The summer was exceptionally hot, and it would appear possible that the heat here is largely dependent on the intensity of the south-west monsoon. The extreme heat does not commence till about three weeks after the monsoon has broken in Bombay, and it is a curious incident that the last monsoon and the hottest summer in the Gulf for some years should coincide. Two Agents were attached to Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., and during the six busy shell months two Agents of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. were pre- sent. A merchant named Mr. Rosenthal was buying pearls from July to September. The Agency was held charge of by Movements of Political Agent. Major F. B. Prideaux till the 27th May w hen Captain C. F. Mackenzie took over charge.72 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The trouble between the A1 Bu Ainain tribe and Shaikh Abdur Rahman- bin-Jasim, mentioned in last year's Katr - report, came to a head in September on account of an increased tax on the tribal pearling boats. It will be remem bered that last year the tribe sent emissaries to Basrah for Turkish assistance. On receipt of news of the fresh trouble the Political Agent visited Shaikh Jasim at Lusail and the latter said he would do what he could to settle matters, but at the same time it was clear that he had no love for the tribe and did not care whether they left Katr or not. The result was that no terms were arrived at and shortly after the tribe destroyed their huts and left for Kasr as Sabaih (north of Katif). A quasi-^iv&amp;Gy took place at Fuwairat in September, A Persian boat had been driven out of its course and took refuge there. The Nakhoda swam off to'shore to see if he could sell his cargo of goats and firewood. In the meantime a few tribesmen went off and sailed the boat on to a reef when it broke up. They then proceeded to land the cargo and only paid for a por tion. It has not yet been decided what steps should be taken with the delin quents. Small bands of the Ajman have frequently made plundering expeditions in Katr, and this year, when most of the Katr people were out pearling, they again made a raid and carried off some camels and goats. After Ramzan Shaikh Jasim began to make preparations, and in December he sent his son Shaikh Abdullah with some 3,000 men to attack them. The food for the men was mostly impressed and all non-fighters had to subscribe rice and flour. Camels and other riding animals were also requisitioned and so the expedi tion cost nothing to the Chief of Katr. This body came up with a few Ajman, Manasdr, and Beni Hajir and robbed what they had,'but casualties were practically nil. On their home- ward journey they attacked a caravan of rice and dates consigned to the Ajman and captured some camels and goats. Although no serious fighting has taken place, the whole year Has been witness of numerous petty struggles tories^' Katlf ' and the ad ^ acent tribal terr1 ' and robberies interspersed with more serious attacks on caravans on the Ojaii; Hasa route. In March the Mutassarif of Hasa, Mahir Pasha, took troops and two guns to attack Ragaiya, a large Bedouin encampment, but apparently without effecting any success. About the same time he inveigled the headmen of Ayun into Hofuf, and threatened to destroy the village which is fortified with a wall and a moat. This was on account of their assisting outlawed Bedouin. A caravan of 70 camels was waylaid by the Manasir between Hofuf and Ojair and shortly after a caravan of 40 camels on the way to Hasa was looted by the A1 Murra, with the result that the caravan escorts have been strength ened to 250 horsemen. A large caravan was moving from Ojair to Hasa in May escorted by a large number of troops. They were attacked and dispersed by com bined bands of Beni Hajir, Manasir and A1 Murra Bedouin, who are said to have ambushed them.' The value of the loot was some 6,000 Liras. No further robberies of caravans took place until late in August when same Ajman successfully attacked some 40 loaded camels on their way to Ojair. The Mutassarif took strong action and recovered the loot and took a fine of 1,000 reals from Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, their headman. A petty caravan robbery occurred in October on the same route. In April it was reported that the Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud was grant ed a monthly allowance of 150 Liras, and allowances of 80 Liras were also paid monthly to his father and grandfather.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. VS Whether the allowances were ever paid or not seems difficult to^e7- tam, hut they do not appear to have been very efficacious and, shortly after the close of the year under report, the allowances were officially stopped , In fP' 1 A 3 ® ed0U1 fl s . were ^ lled by Katifis, but owing to the prompt action of the Mutassarif m sending mediators, trouble was averted on the payment ot 2,400 reals blood-money to the relations Two or three times during the course of the year Turkish officials came from Basrah to take a census of the Katif date palms. As no finalitv seems to be arrived at it would appear that these officials take bribes to underesti mate the number of trees with the result that no fresh tax can be fairlv imposed. J Owing to a good date and pearl season there was improvement in the general condition, though I am afraid it will take some time before the losses of date palms in the previous year's fighting can be recovered Mahir Pasha was Mutassarif in Hasa from January to August Sevvid Anf Beg from September to December, while Saad Beg came about the middle of December. Seyyid Arif Beg was most popular and seemed to be a strong man. A petition was sent to Basrah for his retention, and on his departure he was escorted by a large number of friends to Ojair. In Katif there were even more changes of the Kaimmakam post The incumbents were Rahim Effendi from January to April, Aoni Effendi from May to November, Abbas Effendi for a few days and Izzat Beg till the end of the year.

The year 1909, though remarkable for an abnormally hot summer, as J much as 116-9° being registered as the climate and Rainfall. maximum shade temperature for the 31st July appears fortunately to have ended the last two years' drought as good rain fell during the last two months. The Bedouin tribes suffered severely from famine, numbers of their live-stock having died from starvation, and others sold in Kuwait for very low prices to obtain food. Latest reports from the desert give encouraging accounts of the growth of fodder. An extract prepared from the Agency daily meteorological reports is appended. _ . During the year Shaikh Mobarak's vigorous administration has continued in maintaining excellent law and order Local affairs. ^ ^ ^ own For some years the Kuwait shroffs have been depreciating the Indian rupee by refusing to exchange it at its full value of 64 copper pice, against which the exchange rate of dollars is calculated. The fact was brought to the Shaikh's notice by some well-to-do pearl merchants returning from Bom bay, whereupon he at once took action, had all the money-changers beaten, confiscated part of their capital and issued orders prohibiting the rate of ex change for rupees falling below 64 pice. During the year the Shaikh has also had all weights and measures in the bazaars examined and shopkeepers found using incorrect substitutes were fined. Mr. Kemp, the only European in the Shaikh's employ, in July resigned his post as Chief Engineer of the Shaikh's steam yacht, his duties being now in the hands of two Arabs, formerly his firemen. Visits were paid to Kuwait during the year by Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah in October, and in Decem- visit of Shaikh Hamed -ai-Khahfa. Jber by Shaikh Hamed-bin-Esa-al- Khalifa accompanied by his younger brother Abdullah and Shaikh Ibrahim- bin-Khalid with a following of about 100 men. After a few days' stay in Kuwait the latter party went out hawking and were met by the Political Agent in the course of his tour. After about a fortnight they left for Bahrain overland against Shaikh Mobarak's advice. It is said Shaikh Mobarak gave the young Chiefs and their followers costly presents in clothes to the value of some $4,000 besides entertaining the whole party during their visit and providing them with transport and food, for their journey to Jazirat-al-Amayir, whence his yacht took them to Bahrain. Many Bedouin Shaikhs have visited the Political Agent during the year, among them being Ma'ana-ibn-Juma, Shaikh of the Athain Ajman, Mitni-ibn-Hilal o'f the Thaffir, Aghab-bin-Ghanaim of the Jiblan Umtair, Jafram and Haif-al-Fugam of the As Sabah Umtair, Muhammad-bin- Sultan-ad-Dawish, Muhammad-ibn-Athnain of the Sbi'a, Fahaid-al-Fahuma of the Awazim and many others. Owing to scarcity of food and fodder comparative tranquillity has been the feature of Neid politics in the past Neji Affairs. year, excepting small raids of which some are noted below.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909, 75 From the latest information it would appear that all parties in Nejd are husbanding their resources and taking advantage of the present good sea son, the first for two years, to get their riding cattle, the Bedouin's real source of power, into good condition. Beyond this, efforts are continually made to attract the fickle Bedouin tribes to one side or the other by promises of reward, loot or protection from aggression, and the like. Raids and counter-raids by small sections of various tribes have been Tribal Politics. ^ ther , Sequent owing to famine and it is noteworthy that probably for the first time during Shaikh Mobarak's- rule Kuwait camels have been raided from so close as within 25 miles of the town. In January it was reported that Bin Saud had summoned Muhammad, bin-Hithlain, Shaikh of the Ajman, to join him in a raid against the Sham- mar. The latter refused, saying he could not leave his own country. Ap parently this young and powerful Chief has begun in his ambition to regard Hofuf, Katif, and Hasa as his own property. Of the Agency escort camels raided in December 1908, 4 were recovered between January and March. For the remaining 13, Shaikh Mobarak sent two of his men with letters to Ibn Rashid and other Shaikhs. The men returned in July with 10 camels, only 3 being of those originally looted and the remaining 7 having been brought in exchange. The Shaikh regretted that his endeavours had ended so disappointingly but .as there was no hope of any better result, the substitutes were accepted and the incident closed. In the beginning of August two of the Agency camels were taken by mis take in a raid by the A1 Mala'aba section of the Umtair near Ar-Rakhaimiya. These were subsequently recognised and recovered through Haif-ibn-Bada'-al- Fugam, Shaikh of the As Sabah section, who has frequently visited the Agency. The powerful Ajman tribe has been prominent in tribal politics during the year. In September they raided successfully as many as 800 camels belonging to the Awazim and the Kuwait Araibdar whilst grazing in the vici nity of Jahra. Shaikh Mobarak was much incensed at a raid so close to his capital and demanded restitution within two months, threatening severe reprisals. It is believed that some have been returned to the Awazim, but that 620 are still due. A raid was also attempted soon after, probably by the same party, on Shaikh Mobarak's own camels at As Safa. The Ajman also looted a Nejd caravan, returning with provisions from Kuwait, at Ld Dhana. In August or September Muhammad -bin-Hithlain, the Shaikh of the Ajman, was captured by the Turkish authorities at Hasa and imprisoned until ^1, were paid by his tribe for his release. He was ill-advised enough to enter Hasa with a following of only 7 men, and so gave the Turks their opportunity. Owing to the frequency and daring of the Ajman raids Shaikh Mobarak, in December, sent out a party headed by Shaikh Ah-bm-Khalifa, his gran nephew, to patrol the desert and keep the Ajman beyond Kuwait environs. This patrol party heard that Saud-bin-Lami, Shaikh of the Jiblan in whose punishment for looting certain of his men near Hasa Bin Saud had asked Shaikh Mobarak's assistance, was camping on J t !? e A f 1 V r . t . he Vl ld ^ of n lJvrair wells. Knowing Saud-bin-Lami to be ' wanted, Ab-bm-Khahfa endeavour ed to entrap him but Saud evidently smelt a rat and returning an impemnent reply, made off. Ali-bin-Khalifa after several fruitless effortseventuaUy suc^ ceeded in rounding him up at A1 Amlah near Samawah. J^ud-bm-Lami j J&gt;t succeeded in escaping with only two of his slaves, his son, a a , 8 , ■ ed, his wife and the whole of his camp and animals falling into Ah-bin Khalifa's hands. The above incident is of interest as showing Shaikh Mobarak's support of Bin Saud. Owing to Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani's ^mands t^ a ^ Bu Ainain (an offshoot of the Bam Khalid) deserted a ra , territory. at Kasr-es-Sabaih which is claimed to be within Sha kh Motjara^ s termory Their Shaikh is said to have paid Muhammad-bm-Hithlain B300 for Ajman76 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF protection and to contemplate visiting Kuwait in the near future to obtain Shaikh Mobarak's formal permission to their new settlement. They are also reported to have approached the Turkish authorities in Basrah and Katif to secure them from molestation by Bedouins. The notable events of the year were three marriages in the family, cele brated during June between the follow- Shaikh Mobarak's Affaira. ; _ 0n ^ ^ Salman 4 )ni . Hamid-bin-Subah and a daughter of Shaikh Subah-bin-Muhammad-bin- Subah; on the 18th, Shaikh Abdulla-bin-Subah-bin-Muhammad-bin-Subah and a daughter of Shaikh Saud-bin-Muhammad-bin-Subah; and on the 19th, between Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Jabir-bin-Mobarak and his first cousin^ a daughtsr of Shaikh Salim-bin-Mobarak. These marriages being between close relatives should do much to further unite the Subah family and prevent internal strife. The Shaikh's relations with the Political Agent have been uniformly , , very friendly, thousrh it is doubtful Shaikh's relations with tho Political Agent. t J le '' Sha i kh ever unreservedly gives the latter his confidence. Early in January a portrait of His Majesty Edward VII was formally presented to the Shaikh. The event was made the occasion for a goodly gathering of the leading men in Kuwait at which Major Knox briefly remark ed upon the great friendship so long existing between the British Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait; and that, in token of that friendship, the King- Emperor had been pleased to send his friend Mobarak-us-Subah his portrait. The portrait, a large one in oils by Mr. Marchetti, which had been fixed in a prominent position in the Shaikh's large new reception-room, and covered with a Union Jack, was then unveiled. Shaikh Mobarak was greatly pleased with the gift and took much personal interest in the arrangements. Two saluting guns, presented to the Shaikh by the Government of India, arrived in the end of September. One of Gift of salnting gnns. a q j . 3 _ pr HotchkisSj has been mounted in his steam yacht and the other, a brass 6-pr. muzzle-loader, has been placed in front of the Shaikh's palace. In January the Shaikh asked for a loan of 2 lakhs, which Government were pleased to grant. The Shaikh Loan to Shaikh. j i . i i accepted the conditions and repaid the first instalment in October, the next and final moiety being repayable in 1910. Government were pleased during the j^ear to raise the Shaikh's personal . . .salute to 12 guns and to grant a salute of S SQilUt;©. w i 'i • ii# 5 guns to his eldest son. In recognition of these and other favours. Shaikh Mobarak kindly offered rent-free the Agency premises for which R60 a month has hitherto been paid, and Government were pleased to accept the overture. It is regrettable that the Shaikh still prefers not to utilize the services of the Agency Assistant Surgeon in cases of illness in his own family. At the beginning of Eamzan he was seriously ill himself and lately his favourite son, Hamed, has been suffering from small-pox, but in neither case has he asked for assistance. It seems hardly creditable that he should entertain suspicion of our motives to the extent of fearing medical aid from the Agency, yet for a man of Shaikh Mobarak's intelligence his prejudice appears inexplicable in any ether way. Shaikh Mobarak has been friendly with Ottoman officials and during „ , x . m i • r. x, -x- the year has not complained specifically Relations with lurkish authorities. ^ ,S . , . , r, i • r • of their treatment of him or his pro perties. He informed the Political Agent that H. E. the Wali of Basrah had, at the time of the elections to the new Turkish Parliament, written urging him to send a representative from Kuwait, but that he had not complied.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 77 In February it was reported that the Commandant of the Turkish fort a t Fao had entertained the Shaikh when the latter visited the newly con structed embankments, regarding which there were difficulties in 1908. The Shaikh has not complained of any further encroachment, and the above would appear to show that some friendly understanding has been reached between the parties. In May the Turkish authorities requested Shaikh Mobarak to assist them in punishing the robbers of a caravan between Ojair and Hasa, but the Shaikh replied that he was unable to do so owing to these places being beyond his territory. Shaikh Mobarak concluded, in February, the purchase for T£14,000 „ , x , from Shaikh Saadun of the Muntafik of Purchase o a e-gar ens. his riverain property known as Muta- wiya adjoining Zain, in the sale of which the Turkish authorities had pre viously interfered. The purchase of the Fa-Chagiya property from the as-Zuhair family, mentioned in last year's report, was not actually completed until the 14th February 1909 (21st Mohurrum 1326). The friendship between Shaikhs Mobarak and Khazal continues as close as ever, and the former has frequently Shaikh's relations with Mohammerai. Fallahiyah Shaikh Khazal paid a surprise visit to Kuwait in October, the ostensible reason being that, hearing his friend was either ill or dead, and knowing his scruples, Shaikh Khazal brought down his own medical man to treat him. Shaikh Khazal stayed only 2 days as Shaikh Mobarak was quite well, though it is true he had been seriously ill some time before. Shaikh Khazal arrived with a retinue of about 80 armed men and one cannot but think that his visit was prompted not solely by anxiety for his friend's health, for Shaikh Khazal still remains heavily in debt to Shaikh Mobarak. To what extent it is diffi cult to estimate, though local gossip puts the balance at some T£10,000 to T£ 15,000, and 4 years of the period agreed upon for liquidation have still to run. Shaikh Khazal is the only person in whom Shaikh Mobarak can be said to repose absolute confidence, or whose advice he seeks and acts upon. Whether this influence is entirely for good or whether Shaikh Khazal reciprocates the confidence is doubtful. The public health of Kuwait has not been good during the year; small-pox has been prevalent through- Public Health. ou t and many deaths have occurred, especially among children. As the people take no precautions for isolation the disease became epidemic towards the end of the year and still continues, though in a less severe form. The Dispensary has been regularly open and in all 5,582 patients (over 4,000 men and only 615 children) were Agency Dispensary. treated, averaging a daily attendance of 50*56. The Dispensary returns show digestive system ailments, worms, eye- diseases, and malaria to be the most prevalent maladies. Only 185 vaccina tions were performed in spite of the continuance of small-pox, the Arabs believing that once in a life-time is sufficient protection. The Ddspensary is badly in need of proper accommodation, and it is to be hoped that the execution of the plans drawn up in 1909 may be made pos sible early in the next financial year. No effective quarantine as required under the Paris Convention was enforced. Towards the end of May inti- Quarantme. mation was conveyed to the Shaikh officially of the outbreak of plague in Bahrain and he was urged to take precautionary measures, the^ Agency Assistant Surgeon's services being placed at his disposal. Though ridiculing the idea that the disease inADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF ; |L^ M 1 Bahrain was really plague, the Shaikh issued orders for passengers thence ^ to be quarantined in boats, but even this primitive measure was freely fie evaded. In June the fast mail steamers gave up calling at Kuwait, and as the epidemic in Bahrain soon ran its course the vexed question of quarantine dropped and still awaits solution. ^es.

I ^ The I. G. T. S. 'Patrick Stewart' made a flying visit to Kuwait in Hi November, the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, paying an informal call on i ^ the Shaikh.

' Lawrence ' five times. liek Arms and ammunition are no longer imported by the mail steamers or the Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation One I Company's ships, the trade having ^tiilll gravitated entirely into native sailing craft. The arms market was dull dur- ^ ing the year, importers complaining that they were unable to make profits. - Regular imports have continued, however, in fairly large quantities, the rea son given being that the large dealers were bound by forward contracts with Ly home manufacturers to take certain quantities at specified periods, with de livery in Maskat, and they were unable to cancel these. Several new shops have been opened in the bazaars and arms are now sold openly. ly Goguyer's firm at Maskat again attempted to open business in Kuwait, but his request for permission was refused by the Shaikh. The capture of dhows off the Mekran coast by His Majesty's ships to- iiirja wards the end of the year has, for the time being, practically stopped the im- n port from Maskat. The Shaikh ds considerably interested in this import yn financially, for every rifle carries an import duty of $6. | fso ( It is to be regretted that Shaikh Mobarak, in spite of the obviously large 4oo regular trade in arms, still attempts to hoodwink the Political Agent that |j very few reach Kuwait by sea, and those few are imported simply to fill local requirements. A very rough estimate (for figures are difficult to procure) puts J Foi the number of rifles in stock in Kuwait at 14,000 and nearly 10,000 cases of ^ cartridges, mostly Mausers and Martinis. I jiigffl Slaves have occasionally come to the Political Agent with complaints against their masters. Their cases are represented to the Shaikh and the f| e slaves are usually returned by him to their owners, who are at the same time severely warned against future ill-treatment. This seems to be suffi ciently effective, for only 6 petitions were received in the year and these were ^ all new cases. Slaves are said to be sold in the Kuwait bazaars if their masters find tbem troublesome or unwilling to stay with them, and on the whole it appears thatPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1909. 79 a slave is far too valuable as property to be wantonly ill-treated or made away with. The 1909 pearling season proved to be a very successful one, and many of the divers have been able to get out is enes. ^ the clutches of their nakhudas and towashes. Some gambling at the beginning of the season forced up prices very high with the natural result that, towards the end of the year, there was a slump with low prices at which there were no sellers. The total sum real ized on this season's pearls by Kuwait merchants is estimated at anything between 25 to 30 lakhs of rupees. No pearl divers were required for the winter season of 1909-10 by the Ceylon Pearl Fisheries Company, and consequently no passes were issued by the Agency. The B. I. S. N. Co.'s slow and fast mail services continued to make the . port in alternate weeks until the end of ipping ' July when the place of the fast mail was taken by the Agency steam launch, ' Lewis Pelly,' running to and from Fao. The arrangement has worked well enough for the mails, but passengers and the trading community are undoubtedly much inconvenienced, the former having to make a journey of over a week via Bahrain and Bushire to reach Mohammerah and Basrah, whilst the latter find their trade hampered by being restricted to shipping specie to India only once a fortnight and that by a very slow service. A weekly service of any kind would be a boon. M. A. Varin, formerly of the Belgian Customs staff at Bushire, visit ed Kuwait in February with the osten- Foreigners an Trave ers. sible object of introducing German gold jewellery and booking orders for other goods of German manufacture In January Mr. J. C. Pearson, accompanied by a Greek interpreter, arrived on behalf of the Carnegie Institute of Washington, U. S. A., in connec tion with a scientific enquiry in terrestrial magnetism. One Ibrahim-bin-Adhami, a Turk, arrived on the 22nd April with a pre sent of 10 bags of coffee for the Shaikh, said to be from the Sultan of Lahej. On October 7th a Hungarian, named Emmanuel Lacon, landed in Kuwait. He described himself as travelling round the world on foot, having started from Transylvania, in April 1905, with no funds. He desired to walk to Baghdad but was induced by the Political Agent to accept a free passage in a sailing boat to Fao, as offering a better chance of his eventually fulfilling his ambition. Xhe Resident did not visit Kuwait during the year, but Major Trevor, First Assistant, and Captain Rae, Second Tours and Visits of British Officials. Ass i s { an t ; both paid short visits in January and March respectively. In March His Majesty's Consul at Basrah, Mr. Crow, stayed a week in Kuwait during which questions connected with the Turkish demand for certi ficates of Ottoman nationality from Kuwait subjects, and the Shaikh's pro perties on the Shatt-el-Arab, were thoroughly discussed. The Political Agent made two trips up the Shatt-el-Arab and met His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah. Political Agent's Tonrs. During November' and December he also made a short tour of 18 days into the hinterland south and west of Kuwait, during which much difficulty was experienced in obtaining forage and water and consequently no fresh ground was broken though opportunity was taken to check and add to previous mapping work.

It will be noted from the above that changes have taken place during the year at Bandar Abbas, Kerman, Maskat and Bahrain. At Bandar Abbas, Captain Rae proceeded on furlough in May, and was succeeded by Captain H. V. Biscoe from the Baluchistan Agency. In the case of Kerman, Major Ducat, who was on privilege leave at the beginning of the year, was transfer red to an appointment in India and did not return to Kerman, handing over* charge by telegram to Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Haig, who joined via Tehran from furlough. At Maskat, Major Trevor, First Assistant Resident, Bushire, relieved Mr. R. E. Holland, I.C.S., on the latter's appointment as first Assist ant to the Agent to the Governor-General in Rajputana, Major Trevor being replaced at Bushire by Captain R. L. Birdwood. At Bahrain, Captain C. F. Mackenzie was obliged to proceed to Europe on sick leave, in November, and was succeeded by Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., returning from leave. The Resident, who, on arrival at Bombay from leave, was directed to pre sent himself at the Head-quarters of Government for the discussion of several Gulf questions, proceeded to Calcutta in company with His Excellency t e Naval Commander-in-Chief, and eventually resumed charge of the duties ot the Persian Gulf Residency, on 1st April, from Major Trevor, who had been officiating during his absence. At the opening of the year, the situation was about as negatively unsatis factory as it could well be. While the General Situation. irritation resulting from the presence of Russian troops in the north, was still kept alive by their continued retention, the Persian Government itself, owing to the entire absence of funds, was un able to take any effective measures of its own, which would oblige Russia admit that the withdrawal of her troops was at length feasible. b2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Everything hung upon the question of finance. Without money, the Cen tral Government was powerless to take any step^ to improve the situation. The two allied Powers were fTmck faci$ ready to provide the necessary ad vance or loan, but were naturally unwilling to do so without proper safeguards for the regulation of its expenditure; while the Persian Government, badly as she needed the funds, refused to concede to the reasonable stipulations of the two Governments. The negotiations, dragged on month after month, the numerous other questions which hinged on the settlement, of this one, remain ing in a state of suspension. Meanwhile, in the south, the outlook continued to go from bad to worse. The local authorities at Shiraz had fail- Fars and Southern Persia. ^ ^ ^ any punitive action in connec . tion with the attack on the Russian Consul-General's party, in the preceding November, and the tribe which had been responsible for it, the Boir Ahmecii section of the Kuhgelu, had gained dangerous prestige by their successful and unpunished attack. His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz considered that the only remedy would be a British punitive expedition; but this departure from our policy of non-intervention did not commend itself to higher authority, who intimated that the intervention of an Indian force was in no way contem plated. It was recognised, however, that the trade route question had now assumed serious urgency. The Kazerun route had been closed altogether since the attack on the Russian caravan, and the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, Kashgai, had endeavoured to force traffic; on to the Jirreh route; but this alternative was greatly objected to by the commercial community, both Persian and Eng lish, as being devoid of telegraph or caravanserais or adequate arrangements for fodder, and also because the latter part of the route, through Tangistan, was outside the sphere of which the Sowlet could guarantee the security. Ultimately, however, the Central Government, having taken responsibility for the Jirreh route, we were obliged to accept it. In February, the situation was complicated by the intensity of the jeal ousy existing between the Chiefs of' the rival Bakhtiari and Kashgai tribes, and indeed from the general uneasiness; prevailing among local potentates in the south in respect to the designs and ambitions of the Sardar-i-Assad, Bakh tiari. Up to now, at all events as far as the south is concerned, the Chiefs of the great tribes had always restricted their ambitions to the leadership of their tribal councils and the promotion of tribal interests, locally. Partici pation in the administrative government of Persia had been regarded as a function foreign to the role of a tribal Chief. So long as the part the Sardar- i-Assad was playing appeared to his compeers to be disinterested and merely assumed in order to assist in the task of relieving the peasantry of Persia from the intolerable yoke of despotism under which they laboured, the pro ceedings of the Bakhtiari Chief were regarded with passive, if not demon strative, good will. But when it was seen that the Sardar-i-Assad was gradually establishing Bakhtiari domination not only at Tehran, but also^ at the provincial centres in the south, and was believed to be using his position to pull the strings of tribal interest at the Capital, he became the object of the greatest apprehension both to the Kashgai and to the Shaikh of Moham- merah; the former, intensely jealous of the rise of Bakhtiari power, and the latter being possessed by the instinctive fear that, having cleared the field by reducing the Kashgai, the Bakhtiari would turn their attention to himself. It was useless to advise the Shaikh to maintain an independent attitude and stand, aloof from exotic politics. He however replied that this was no ques tion of foreign politics, but a prospect which menaced the security and well- being of himself and his territory to their very foundations. ' If you cannot guarantee me against the results of Bakhtiari policy as pursued by the Sardar- i-Assad from the Capital,' he said, ' you must leave me to forestall or insure myself against the dangers ahead, in my own way.' Such assurances as the Shaikh needed were difficult to give, and the Shaikh's own dispositions for safeguarding himself, included the formation of a league between himself, the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, Kashgai, and the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, providing for ostensibly concerted action between the three in the event of their interestsPOLITICAL KfeSIDENCY FOR iSl6. being menaced. The substance of this eofflp &amp;ct was that the parties ioined hands for (z) the protection of the inothei* country, (it) the support of the Constitutional government, {in) the maintenance of security on the trade routes of their respective spheres, (*.) recognition of. and co-operation with, other notables anxious to preserve the Constitution and independence of Persia, (v) support by the other two in case the interests of one were menaced (ml whoie-hearted support to the Medjliss in the fearless performance of their duties, including the control of interested politicians. Under the name of the League of the south,' some prominence has been given to this paper compact as a somewhat dangerous instrument, but, in the writer's opinion; it proved, not without itg advantages at the time, as a safety valve and as a hint to the Sardar-i-Assad to curl his ambitions; while, regarded as the basis of a really defensive alliance, it is not worth the paper on which it was written; neither of the three parties presumably have the least intention, un less their own interests were directly concerned, of interpreting it in any more formidable manner than by a Cash contribution and expression of a pious wish for his ally's good luck. So far at any rate the existence of the compact ap pears on the whole to have conduced to the general peace. The imminence of the conclusion of this triple agreement; the attack on Mr. J. H. Bill on his way home, in the middle of April, between Shiraz and Ispahan; the acute friction between the Turkish authorities at Basrah and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, leading up to the bombardment of the Shaikh's village of Zain, opposite Mohammerah, were the most lively questions on the political horizon during the month following the Resident's return from leave. They will be alluded to again under the head of the Consulates to which they primarily concern. The lamented demise of His Majesty the King, Edward VII,^ was received Bushir6 with no less grief and consternation by the British community in Bushire than it was by His Majesty's demoted subjects throughout the world. Respectful ex pressions of sympathy were received from local inhabitants and potentates throughout the sphere of the Residency. Local conditions in Bushire were very unsatisfactory, but mainly in a negative way. The Darya Begi has in the last few years made two or three more or less ignominious exits from the stage of Gulf politics. On the pre sent occasion it will be remembered that, at the time of Seyyid Murteza's dis turbances, in April last year. His Excellency, who was then in Tehran in seclu sion, was regarded by the Persian Government to be the man most likely to be able, owing to his long, local experience of the Gulf, to rescue the Gulf Ports from the condition of acute unrest to which they had been brought by the ex travagances of the so-called Nationalist movement. His Excellency managed to hold out until the end of the year, but, throughout his present tenure, found the difficulties of the post of Governor of the Gulf Ports greatly enhanced under the new regime. Without troops to enable him to enforce his authority or collect revenue; with an uncontrolled vernacular press in which he could be pilloried by any ragamuffin from the bazaar who imagined that he had a grievance; or misrepresented by any intriguer with an axe to grind; con stantly bombarded by ignorant or inquisitorial telegrams from the Ministers or Medjliss in Tehran;—his position is never worth a week's purchase; and the only wonder is that individuals continue to be forthcoming who are willing to accept office under such conditions. The Darya Begi's official hands are possibly no cleaner than the ordinary run of Persians of his class; but from the point of view of the work of the Residency and British interests in the Gulf Ports, His Excellency has been by far the most friendly and well disposed Governor with whom we .have been favoured during the last decade or so. The beginning of the year found an agitation against the sturdy Governor-General, the Saham-ud-Dow- az ' leh, in full progress. Everything pos sible was done by his detractors to discredit him, and make his position im possible. After repeated requests for permission to resign, the Governor- B4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Generals wish was ultimately; complied with, on the 18th of January, and he left Shiraz on the 5th of February, Zafar-us-Sultaneh being appointed to suc ceed him. Mr. J. H. Bill, I.C.S., of the Political Department of India, made over charge of the Consulate to Mr. Smart of the Levant Consular Service, on the 4th of April. Mr. Smart had arrived from the north, via Ispahan, travel ling with a strong Sowar escort, which again escorted Mr. Bill back to Tehran. The latter was attacked between Abadeh and Shulgistan by a party of Kuh- gelu, on the 15th of April. Mr. Bill, realising that his caravan was about to be attacked, determined to try conclusions with the party while they were yet in an open country; he and his sowars came into contact with the robbers and succeeded in putting them to flight. Three of the gang however, having been rounded up, showed fight, and two Indian sowars were killed in the skirmish which ensued. Mr. Bill himself •fortunately escaped unhurt. Compensation of 5,000 tomans each for the two sowars killed was claimed from the Persian Government, and specific measures for re-establishing the security of the road were discussed with them. Meanwhile, the new Governor-General, Zafar-us- Sultaneh, reached Shiraz on the 29th of May, with 800 infantry and 200 sowars; all, however, armed with obsolete rifles, and none supplied with cart ridges. The new choice proved to be a mere farceur, his only virtues seeming to be opium-smoking and an insuperable objection to any kind of work. He only lasted until the end of July when he was dismissed as incompetent, the situ ation in Shiraz having been rendered considerably worse by his short sojourn. He was succeeded, as a temporary measure, by Kawam-ul-Mulk, a notable of Shiraz, whose appointment was strongly resented by the now powerful Sowlet- ed-Dowleh. During September, the situation in Pars and Laristan became worse, and it was suspected that the Sowlet was deliberately promoting disorder in order to force the Persian Government to give him chief control in Pars. Finally, on the 14th of October, the patience of His Majesty's Government having been exhausted. His Majesty's Minister was authorised to present a note to the Persian Government to the effect that, if order was not restored on the Bushire- Shiraz-Ispahan road within three months, we should insist on the formation of force of road-guards under British officers. The terms of this note and the intentions of the British Government were much discussed and misrepresented in the Press, but at any rate they had the effect of arousing the Persian Government to some sense of the gravity of the position. They replied how ever with many specious arguments, intended to show that there was no real justification for the delivery of the British note, that British trade in the south had not suffered, and that the Persian Government were taking all pos sible measures to remove causes of complaint. One of the remedies promised was the appointment of an effective Governor-General to be amply supplied with funds for the creation of a special corps of road-guards. The difficulty was to find the individual to take up the thorny post of Governor-General of Fars. The selection eventually fell on the actual ' Nizam-us-Sultaneh. This individual, under the title of Salar-i-Moazzim, was Governor of the Gulf Ports at the time of Lord Curzon's visit in 1903. Afterwards, as Salar-i- Mukarram, he became Governor of Arabistan, and then, on the death of his uncle, the old Nizam-us-Sultaneh, in 1908, succeeded to the latter title and became Governor-General of Kermanshah. A strong administrator, though with a bad reputation for cruelty and rapacity, he had done good work at Kermanshah, and if anybody could, in the present condition of the state ot Denmark bring a measure of order and security to Fars, it was hoped that he might. His arrival was awaited at the end of the year, pending which the Kazerun route remained still closed; scarce caravans however passed from time to time over the Firuzabad and other routes under the Sowlet s control, and there was a slight improvement in the general situation. His Majesty's Government having agreed, on the recommendation of tne Resident and the Government of India, Lmgah - to appoint a British officer as Vice-Con- sul at Lingah, tentatively for a period of three years, the appointment wasPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. offered to Mr. R. H. New, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who, as Assistant Superintendent of the Jask Sub-Division, had for the past two or three years been rendering valuable co-operation to the Naval and Political authorities, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic on the Mek- ran Coast. Mr. New assumed charge of his duties on the 29th of March. The objects with which Mr. New's appointment was made, were that he should study and stimulate trade at Lingah, and endeavour to bring about an effective competition by British traders with German enterprise at that port; secondly, that he should, as opportunity and experience made it possible, visit and study the trade of Debai, and thus prepare the way for the more effec tive British representation on the Trucial Coast generally; thirdly, that he should co-operate in the measures in progress for the suppression of the arms traffic, which industry appears to be extending its tentacles northwards. The affairs of Lingah afford no material for permanent interest until the last quarter of the year. The hinterland and Laristan generally had still re mained in the state of lawless chaos in which it had been left last year by the vagaries of Seyyid Abdul Husein Lari. On the 20th of October, lively news reached Lingah to the effect that Ghulam Hussein Khan Varawi, supported by Ali Akbar Khan of Giladar, Bakar Khan of Ishkhanu, Shaikh Mazkoor of Gaobandi, had collected a force not less than 3,000 strong and intended raid ing Lingah. The inhabitants of the port were greatly alarmed and began making preparations for the removal of their families and valuables. His Majestv's Vice-Consul was directed to send a friendly letter to Ghulam Hussein Khan, warning him that His Majesty's Ships of war were at Lingah and would do what was necessary to protect British subjects, and that the intended raid with which he was credited would involve a good deal of risk to those who participated in it. On the 27th of October, the Deputy Gover nor, having informed His Majesty's Vice-Consul and the Senior Naval 0 _cer that, with the forces at his command, he was unable to accept responsibility for the safetv of the town and the communities inside it, 174 men with 4 guns were landed from H. M. S. ' Fox,' while H. M. S. ' Odin was sent up to the Shib Kuh ports to deal with some dhows of armed men which Shaikh Mazkoor was reported to be sending by sea to participate in the attack ^ Linga_ Ghulam Hussein Khan &amp; Co. replied to His Majesty s Vice-Consul that their business was with the Shaikh of Mugam, and that they had never had any intention of attacking Lingah. It is known, however, from^the correspond ence which was intercepted, that Lingah was their real objective but the action of the British authorities had the effect of averting the raid and on the 10th of November, there being no longer cause for apprehension, H. . Ships ' Fox ' and ' Odin ' were able to re-embark their men It is satisfactory to know that Messrs Gray Paul &amp; Co after a good deal of friendly pressure, and stimulated by the ^ Vice-Consul, have deputed an English employe to look after their mteres Lingah, and I understand that the measure is ^ e 'P a y in S u &gt;,5™ cnffered w c —i i— Bandar Abbas. Bandar Abbas was disturbed by frequent rumours of impending raids. In October, a force of Baharlu P^ e ^ e ^. an Fars, nominally under the control of the ^. a ^ a r m '^ u X 0 , . ' va i U e of the entire district, looting the goods of British Indian subjects to the value of / tne entire district, looting tu« guuus ux — o about half a lakh of rupees, none of which has been recwerecl. ^ Owing to the difficult position in which Bandar Abbas is p y ^ presence of large parties of Afghans, ostensibly there o the smuggling indistinguishable from, and often including, ^ an ^ s . en ^ o e i Z ure of their Of arms 8 who are apt to became truculent on hearing of seizure^! tUeir consignments by our ships, it was considered pru e P y adapted and building forming His Majesty's Consulate « ^^fXTatoTwere car- for self-contained and effective defence. The ne pLnmunication between ried out during the year, and included This the Cable House and the Consulate; almost jw'lapse of time, is a fresh instance of the possibility in Persia of obtaining, by lapse what diplomacy has been powerless to achieve.6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Considering that we are dealing with a country which still exists, even if Kerman 011 su ® erance ' as a Sovereign State in treaty relations with the Great Euro pean Powers, it is difficult to conceive more complete and abysmal chaos than that depicted in Lieutenant-Colonel Haig's report. There is evidently not the slightest semblance of Persian authority surviving in Persian Baluchistan, and it is difficult to imagine how the Central Government can ever hope to re- impose its authority. I leave Colonel Haig's report to tell its own tale. An elective blockade on the Mekran Coast has been maintained by His Persian Mekran Coast. Majesty's Navy at an enormous expense but with signal success throughout the year. With the details of our operations in connection with the suppression ot the traffic, it is impossible to deal satisfactorily within the narrow compass ot this review, and, apart from the arms traffic, there is little to call for com ment in the history of the Mekran Coast for the year. The deportation of Mir Barkat, in March, by the Darya Begi at the in stance of the Military authorities, was thoroughly deserved; unfortunately the obligations of international comity were considered to preclude our deal ing with him ourselves, and the ineffective handling of his case by the Per sian authorities was a factor which had to be taken into account. His re latives, Mir Haji and Mir Mustapha Khan, between whom the Biyaban Dis trict became divided on the exit of Mir Barkat, have proved by no means satis factory persons tx&gt; deal with, and it is quite impossible that we can frequently be intervening in Persian jurisdiction to render them immune from the re prisals which they naturally apprehend from Mir Barkat, now that he has re turned. It seems to be conceivable that, if the Persian Government continue indefinitely unable to exercise any authority over the Baluch Mirs of the Mek ran Coast, we shall be driven to devise some measure of our own for the better protection of the telegraph line and the prevention of the smuggling of arms. There appears to be no doubt that Sardar Seyyid Khan, at present the paramount Chief of Persian Mekran, having become a prey to the excessive consumption of opium, is losing both his influence and his physical power, and it would seem prudent on our part therefore to take time by the forelock and try to bring his probable successor, Islam Khan, effectively under our influence. Things have moved a good deal in Arabistan in the direction of the con- Arabistan solidation of our influence and the Shaikh's position. It is recognised that Great Britain's most valuable interests in Persia lie in, or adjacent to, the Shaikh of Mohammerah's territory, and that the strength of his political posi tion and his prosperity are bound up with ours in that region. I have already referred briefly to the acute friction which existed between the Shaikh and the Basrah authorities in the early spring, and I need not go into the facts of the case, which are fully dealt with by Lieutenant Wilson. In a matter like this, the Shaikh of Mohammerah is placed in a very difficult position. As local ruler of a large tract of country, contiguous to the Turko- Persian Frontier and the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab, and receiving no practi cal support whatever from an incompetent government at the Capital, he has to rely for his safety, and that of the national frontier, on the friendly advice and support of Great Britain, and his own resources. In his present quar rel with the^ Turkish authorities his own Government, if not actually un friendly to him, at any rate gave him no help, owing partly, no doubt, to their ignorance of local political and geographical conditions, and of the important interests involved. He had, however, the hearty support both of the Moham merah Consulate and this Residency, and it was satisfactory to His Excellency to learn, when both sides of the question had been considered by His Majestv's Government, that his attitude throughout the difficulty had met with their approval. Shaikh Khazal realises that, being so closely thrown with the Turks on the Shatt-el-Arab, as he is, and being such a large land-owner both in Basrah and on the Turkish bank of the river generally, it is absolutely necessary forpolitical residency for 1910. ? him (as it is for Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait for the same reasons) to main tain a modus vivendt with the Turkish authorities. fei/therefore he must be credited with a desire, born of expediency, to conciliate them I have already referred in my general remarks to the Shaikh's apprehen sions regarding the pokey of the Bakhtiari Khans in Tehran, and need not re- turn to. the question here. We have to thank the Shaikh for his attitude in regard to the protection of Baiirainis in his territory. The informal arrangement Come to with him during the year places us in a much better position in regard to this question than that we have yet achieved in other Persian ports. The Taraverdiefi Concession, in regard to which the grantor, the present Nizam-us-Sultaneh, adopted a by no means ingenuous attitude, is inconvenient and likely to give the Shaikh of Mohammerah and ourselves- some trouble. The probability is, however, that the tribesmen who would be displaced from their holdings in the event of the execution of the scheme, will raise such diffi culties when it comes to the point, that the Concessionaires will be obliged to retire from the project or sell their interests to the Shaikh of Mohammerah. The Shaikh was greatly pleased and honoured, at the distinction con ferred on him by the British Government in making him an Honorary Knight Commander of the. Indian Empire, and equally relieved and grateful for the extended assurances which were communicated to him at the same time. As far as it is possible to judge at present, the policy pursued by His Majesty's Government in regard to the Shaikh of Mohammerah, is proving eminently successful: it has greatly strengthened the Shaikh's position and his control over the tribes of Arabistan as well as his reputation among the tribal Chiefs, of Southern Persia, who realise that his prosperity and the strength of his position is due to his close relations with the British Government and his friendly attitude to British commerce, and are becoming more disposed to emulate him. The Government of India have been fortunate in having as the first in cumbent on their behalf of the Moahmmerah Consulate, a young officer of great energy who has rendered a great deal of service to geography during his term of duty in Arabistan, and has studied and written up very thoroughly, for the benefit of his successors, all important questions connected 7 with his charge. The record of this Vice-Consulate for the year is mainly taken up with (i) the progress of the Anglo-Persian Oil Allwaz ' Company's operations at the Oil Fields and their dealings with the Bakhtiaris; and (ii), the prominent part played by the Bakhtiaris in the history of Persia for the year, and their relations with the British Government, the Oil Company, the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and the Central Government. For the Oil Company, the year was naturally a difficult one, both for their employes and the management. At the start of an immense enterprise like this, it is inevitable that numerous unforeseen difficulties, small and great, should constantly arise and have, to be met,: and at one time dissensions among the employes and the mismanagement at the Oil Fields, threatened to become a serious, menace to the interests of the Company, but happily the most critical time has now passed, and the visit of two of the Directors, Messrs. Green- way and Hamilton, at the end of the year or beginning of 1911, resulted in the removal of the majority of outstanding difficulties and the infusion of a better spirit among the Company's employes. Since the visit of the Directors, there has been a decided improvement in the working regime oi the Company on the spot. I think I may leave Bakhtiari history, which I have already touched upon incidentally v to Lieutenant Banking's full record, which is of much interest but calls for no special comment in review. In Pusht-i-Kuh, the feud in progress between the Wali and his son, Amanullah, may conceivably loom large in the history of the district during ^the next few years.it 111 ADMINISTITATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF It will be seen that there has been a useful breaking of a new ground among the Kuhgelu, and Lieutenant Ranking has submitted an interesting and industrious report on the condition and internal policy of the tribe. Practically the entire life history of Maskat and the Sultan for the yeat 1910 is summed up in the words ' Arms Maslcat - Traffic.' At the beginning of the year the political situation in connection there&gt; with was as follows The re-assembled Brussels Conference had concluded its sittings and, owing to the attitude of the French Government in regard to the arms trade to Maskat, had failed entirely to find any solution of that problem. We were therefore relegated once more to the hope of arriving at a friendly direct settle ment with France. But so far France had refused to take up the Maskat question except as one item in a general settlement of interests on ' give and take ' lines, and the basis proposed by them was cfne which His Majesty's Government had been unable to entertain. It was arranged therefore that, during 1910, we should maintain measures on the spot, which, without giving the French or the Sultan legitimate cause of complaint from the point of view of international law, would demonstrate both to one and the other that we could, if we chose to spend the money, reduce the traffic to exiguous propor tions by unexceptionable means; and that as we had the mind to do it, it would be worth their while to deal with us while the French commercial stake re presented by the arms traffic possessed a practical monetary value for negotia tion purposes. To this .end, it was decided to adopt no half-measures with the Sultan or the Baluch Chiefs in the way of recompense or inducement for colourable co-operation, but to maintain a full blockade of the Mekran Coast for a whole year at least, and attack the traffic by every possible means with the idea of bringing the French and the Sultan to a suitable frame of mind for negotiation. The results of the measures which have been in force during the year, under the direction of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, have been eminently successful, and have had precisely the effect expected from them, and it now remains to approach the French again, if there is now a hope of a settlement with them, or, failing that, discuss the situation with the Sul tan, who has been reduced to a state ripe for discussion, and devise, in co operation with him, means, to which the French cannot constitutionally object, for keeping the traffic under strict control in spite of them. Our present measures have strained our relations with His Highness Sir Seyyid Faisal and to a great extent destroyed his peace of mind, and we cannot afford, from the point of view of general politics, to allow the present tension to continue indefinitely. It is satisfactory to be able to record that, after somewhat difficult and tedious negotiations regarding the ' Kadra ' Dhow case, which we have been discussing with the Italian Government on behalf of the Sultan, a definitive solution has been reached. The affairs of the Trucial Coast have been brought into troublesome pro- Truciai Oman. minence during the year. The Shaikh of Ajman, Abdul Aziz bin Homeid, died a violent death, in February, at the hands of one of his slaves. He was a very backward and brutish person and his son Homeid, who succeeded him, is still more so. Fortunately Ajman is a principality of little importance. The situation at Kas-el-Kheima also gave cause for some concern, involv ing as it did the personal relations between Shaikh Sagar of Shargah and his uncle v Shaikh Salim bin Sultan, which are at present unsatisfactory partly owing to the ill-concealed mutual aversion of lifelong standing existing 1 be tween them and partly in connection with the Abu Musa case. Attention has mainly been directed however to Debai affairs. Here, as will be seen from previous reports, the Shaikh is a difficult character and has been a most unsatisfactory ruler from the first, and it was unfortunate that the scene of the 'Hyacinth' incident should happen to have been laid at Debai.POLITICAL RESIDENCY PGR 1910. 9 The details of the regrettable affair, resulting in the loss of valuable lives, are recorded in the report of the Trucial Coast, and it is unnecessary to dj more than touch upon it here. The Government of India were pleased to decide that, with the payment of 50,000 rupees fine and the delivery of the 400 rifles, the incident should be considered closed for the present, and that the other measures suggested by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the Resident should re main in abeyance for possible reconsideration when the position on the Coast had returned to normal, and the full effect of the incident on the public mind could be gauged. In any case, it is recognised that the strengthening of our control over the Trucial Coast is becoming a matter of increasing cogency, and the question will shortly be resubmitted for the wise consideration of Government. , The course of the Abu Musa case made no advance during the year. When the Resident left London, in Feb- -ruary 1910, after the receipt by His Majesty's Foreign Office of the German rejoinder, a suggestion for the offer of a commercial compromise was under consideration, and it was expected would be adopted; but His Majesty's Government decided that it was neces sary also to collect evidence for a reply to the fresh German arguments, and as this meant three or four weeks' absence from Bushire, it was not possible for the Resident to undertake the duty until after the close of the year under report. The climate of Bahrain seems to generate a tendency to litigation, and the number of civil suits brought to the Bahrain. Bahrain Agency is most startling when compared with the case-work appertaining to our Agencies at other Gulf Ports. The Salifa (or pearling) cases are likely to present a good deal of diffi- ' culty in the future as it is so difficult to arrive at any specific code of law in regard to them. The cargo-landing arrangements at Bahram have been a source off fre quent worry both to the Political Agent and the Shaikh and the Residency. The utmost patience has been exercised in order to induce^ or enable Shaikh Isa to arrive without coercion from Government, at some just mean of j 50 ™' promise, which we can regard as meeting the reasonable requirements of the trading community. Qatar affairs call for little remark except that the promontory appears to be becoming a base for the distribution of contraband arms, and this ^ e ^' lopment may oblige us to reconsider the question of our relations with the Thani family. . . . ,, ,• It is interesting to note that British traders are turning their attention again to the trade of Qatif—now eschewed by them for a good many years. Shaikh Mubarak's rule continues to be the most sturdy and effect ^ 0± any potentate m the Gulf, but, no doubt, Kuwait. ke strains the long sufferings of his sub jects from time to time with his heavy exactions. One test of the efficiency of his rule, however, is seen in the facility with which he can absent himseil from Kuwait at frequent intervals without any inconvenient result. Like tne Shaikh of Mohammerah his prestige and influence with the tribes and tne Chiefs of the interior have been greatly enhanced by their knowle ge o close relations with the British Government. ^ ^ c The political events of Central Arabia have been much on ^e same lines as usual, but a notable event was the appearance of the Sha.n o T ^ Najd.

REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOB 1910. His relations with the Turks were, or the whole, unsatisfactory; he started well with the new Wali, Suleiman Nathif Bey, but the latter was a schemer and hostile to Mubarak at herat, and the latter's friendly overtures only resulted in attempts on the part of the Wali to trick him into acceptance of the Turkish nationality. The Wali's patriotic ambitions however soon car ried him too far and it was not long before he fell, as the result partly of his active hostility towards the Shaikh of Mohammerah and partly of his un satisfactory relations with Nazim Pasha, Wali of Baghdad. Nathif Bey had been in journalism before taking displomatic office; and, on his retire ment from Basrah, applied himself in writing up in the papers the burning questions of the north of the Gulf from the ' Young Turk ' point of view. After a probationary visit of some months from Br. Bennett, the establish ment of a medical branch of the American Arabian Mission was agreed to by Shaikh Mubarak on the compliance of the Mission with certain conditions satisfactory to the Shaikh and the British Government. In connection with the arms traffic, Shaikh Mubarak's attitude during the year showed some improvement and was not unsatisf actory on the whole. It is true he gave some trouble in regard to a dhow belonging to Messrs. Goguyer of Maskat, which had brought up some 300 Gras rifles under the French flag, but, in view of the presence of the Tricolour and the probability that his action would mean a difficult exchange of communications with Goguyer or the French authorities, the fact that the Shaikh ultimately did what we wanted, was a matter for some satisfaction. According to the Political Agent, the retail sale of arms in Kuwait has now absolutely ceased under the Shaikh's order, and a certain quantity of arms and ammunition which he was allowed to order up from Maskat for his own use, represents the whole import for the year. The Shaikh has been somewhat disturbed during the latter part of the year by the newspaper discussion of the affairs of the Middle East which has been going on and which has included a good deal of talk regarding the status of Kuwait: but he has been very philosophical and sensible on the whole, re lying implicitly on the protective value of his relations with the British Government, and their determination to act up to them.

Captain R. L. Birdwood returned from furlough, on the 9th February, and was posted as Second Assistant in relief of Captain J. S. Crosthwaite, placed on special duty. He relieved Major Trevor as First Assistant Resi dent on the 10th April On the latter's appointment as Political Agent and His Majesty's Consul, Maskat, Captain J. S. Crosthwaite then being reposted as Second Assistant Resident, which appointment he held until the close of the year. Captain C. B. McConaghy performed the duties of Residency Surgeon throughout the year. Mr. Vice-Consul Chick proceeded on leave to England, on 12th May, and returned on December 19th, his duties during his absence being performed by the Consular Assistant, Mr. Newton Worrall, who remained at Bushire throughout the year. Mr. H. G. Chick was appointed ' Commercial Adviser to His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire and Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ' on October 4th, 1910, in addition to his other duties. The news of the demise of His Majesty King Edward VII, on the night n f tt - tit • x t of 6th May, which reached Bushire on Death of His Majesty King Edward VII. . i • .c T+u i 6 the morning of the 7th, was received with consternation. The Persian authorities and the Consular body were most prompt in offering their sympathies; and British subjects and others called on the Resident to offer their condolences. The Resident also received expressions of sympathy from the Arab Chiefs under his jurisdiction. Monsieur N. Passek, Russian Consul-General, remained at Shiraz during „ . . the greater part of the year. He re- oreign epresentatives. turned to Bushire on the 1st October and left for Russia, it is believed for good, a fortnight later, handing over charge to M. Kadloubousky, Dragoman of the Consulate, who remained Acting Rus sian Consul-General till the close of the year. Owing to the refusal of the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, Chief of the Kashgais to guarantee any other route, Mon sieur Passek and his party were compelled, much against their will, to return from Shiraz by the Firuzabad route, under his auspices. Nebil Zia Bey remained in charge of Turkish interests throughout the year. Dr. Listemann, on return from leave, resumed charge of the German Vice- Gonsulate from Herr Wassmuss on the 1st April. Dr. Listemann took over charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate from Herr Krumpeter of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., on the 27th April. Monsieur L. Heritte, the newly appointed French Representative, took over charge of the French Vice-Consulate from Major A. P. Trevor on the 17th January and remained in charge throughout the year. Governor.—In spite of repeated efforts to oust him from his post and viru- „ . ■ 1 lent attacks on his administration by Per- Persian officials. siaii and Indian newspapers, Mirza Ahmed Khan,'Darya Begi, remained Governor of Bushire and the Gulf Ports throughout the year. His Excellency was away from Bushire collecting revenue at Bandar Abbas and other Gulf Ports for four months during the12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF first half of the year, Ahmed Khan, Amir Panj, Deputy Governor and Com mandant of the Persian Regiment at Bushire acting as Governor during his absence. The Amir Panj, though not an over-strong administrator, is above the average of local Persian officials in intelligence and education, and speaks excellent English. He, however, appears to have fallen out with the Darya Begi after the latter's return from Bandar Abbas, and was dismissed by His Excellency from the post of Deputy Governor, this appointment then being held at different periods by Shaikh Naser Chahkutai, Shuja-el-Mamalek (Commandant of Topchis) and Mirza Abdul Reza, the son of one of the Malek- ut-Tujjar's slaves, all of whom were equally incompetent. The Amir Panj, with the permission of the Tehran authorities, left Bushire during the middle of August for Ispahan, taking his detachment with him. Karguzar. —Mirza Ghulam Ali Khan, Saad-es-Sultan, held the post of Foreign Office Agent throughout the year. He is believed to have been origin ally appointed at the request of the German Consulate. His attitude towards the Residency, however, has been friendly, though perhaps characterised by excessive caution and timidity in dealing with British cases.^ He is, however, an inoffensive official without any apparent tendency to intrigue. Kalantar and Kadkhoda. —The direct responsibility for the maintenance of good order in the Bushire Peninsula is entrusted to two officials, the Kalan tar and the Kadkhoda. The former is responsible for the safety of Bushire town, the latter for that of the suburbs of Bushire. The post of Kalantar was held throughout the year by Meshedi Abdul Rasul regarding whose hostile attitude towards the Residency, complaint had several times to be made to the local authorities. The appointment of Kadkhoda was held for a like period by Zair Ali Tangistani, except for a short interval, in July, when His Excellency the Darya Begi re-instated Kaid Muhammad Jaffer, a former Kadkhoda. This appointment was objected to by the T^angistani supporters of Zair Ali who feared less lucrative results from their smuggling operations from Tangistan into Bushire, and His Excellency was eventually compelled to give way and re appoint the Tangistani nominee. In the event of refusal to comply with the Tangistani demands the Darya Begi would in all probability have had to face an invasion similar to that of 1909 which, without troops or funds, it would have been impossible for His Excellency to prevent. The incident is typical of the impotence to which the administration of the Gulf Ports has been re duced under the present regime. Mamoor-i-Maliyeh and Rais-i-Nazmieh. —Two new posts of the ' Con stitutional ' order were created this year by the Central Government. On the 18th October an official entitled the Mamoor-i-Maliyeh made his appearance for the first time in Bushire. He was appointed by the Minister of Finance apparently to act as Finance Secretary and collect revenue. Needless to say it has not been possible for him to perform the latter duty. The incumbent of the appointment is one Mahmood Khan, formerly an interpreter in the Im perial Bank of Persia, Shiraz, from which post he was dismissed. He con tinued in office throughout the year. The other official appointed was the Rais-i-Nazmieh or Chief of Police, one Abdullah Khan, Etezad-i-Hazret, by name. He arrived in Bushire on the 19th December. His activities were limited to wrangles with the Gover nor and the Kalantar regarding the financing of his Department, both of the above-named officials declaring their complete inability to provide him with funds. The Central Government also announced the despatch of two other offi cials from Tehran, namely, an Inspector of Justice and an Inspector of the Municipality. Neither officials, however, arrived in Bushire during the year. At present all four of these officials are a useless charge upon the revenue. Monsieur Leleux held the post of Provincial Director of Customs at Bushire from the beginning of the year till the 12th May when he went on leave being relieved by Monsieur Constant, Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas,POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 13 who remained in charge till the end of the year. Monsieur Degraeve was Assistant Director from the commencement of the year until Monsieur Con stant's arrival when he replaced the latter at Bandar Abbas. Relations between the British merchants and the Customs authorities have been in the main very friendly during the year. In opposing an in creased tax on certain kinds of tea, and on obtaining a reduction of 50 per cent, on the export duty of wheat and barley, the Provincial Director co operated heartily with the merchants. The latter reform, it may be noted, was eventually carried out by the Administrator General of Customs in Tehran on his own responsibility when he perceived the hopelessness of wait ing for action on the part of the Minister of Finance. The embargo on the texport of grain was similarly removed in April, the result of the two measures, coupled with a good crop, being a revival of the export trade in cereals. The question of the repair and rebuilding of the actual Customs premises was the subject of a good deal of discussion between the Director, the mer chants and the Consulate-General. In the course of their efforts to put down smuggling, the Customs Depart ment met with considerable opposition during the year from the tribal chiefs of Tangistan and Dashti, reprisals by the latter going so far as the murder of the Customs Mudirs within their jurisdiction and a threatened attack on Bushire. His Excellency the Darya Begi, when appealed to by the Director to punish the offenders, replied that the tribal levies of the outlying country, which were the only troops at his disposal, although willing to restore order in Lingah and Bandar Abbas, would not fight their neighbours the Tangistanis. The Darya Begi's statement is quite true and troops from up-country are badly needed. The Customs posts in Dashti and Tangistan were accordingly closed, and all export and import from and to the ports of these districts prohibited. Smusfglinsr through all the petty ports along the coast line is now a regularly organised industry, and, with the totally inadequate resources at their com mand, it is very difficult for the local authorities to cope with it. Captain C. B. McConaghy held the post of Chief Quarantine Medical iOfficer in the Persian Gulf throughout Quarantine and Residency Hospital. + i MEMORANDA BY CAPTAIN McCONAGHY ON THE WORKING OF THE QUARANTINE ADMINISTRATION AND OF THE RESI DENCY HOSPITAL ARE ATTACHED. (APPENDIX I.) Bushire Anjuman. —The activities of the Local Anjuman or Town Coun cil of Bushire were confined during the Local Government. fi rs t half of the year under report to the intrigues of its various members against one another notably those of the no torious Mirza Hussein, until lately Dragoman of the German Consulate. This individual, having proclaimed that he had severed all connection with that Consulate succeeded, at the beginning of the year, in getting himself elected as one of the candidates for the two seats allotted to the Gulf Ports in the Tehran Medjliss, the other being one Mirza Ali Kazeruni, a disreputable petty merchant and a fraudulent bankrupt. Both individuals, however, were de nounced as having obtained their election by chicanery and neither of them proceeded to Tehran. Mirza Hussein has since been re-appointed German Consulate Mirza, and the Anjuman in question has ceased to exist. Anjuman-i-Baladiyeh.—K new Anjuman however, ^ known as the ' Anjuman-i-Baladiyeh ' or Municipal Council, came into existence during tne year. Under the direction of the Governor, elections for this body (20 mem bers) were held in the first week of August Its strength and activities m municipal matters have varied from time to time. ^ At one period its num ers dwindled to two members. The body cannot be said to be popular. I s mea ' sures necessitate the provision of funds, which, in turn, involves the evy o Dew taxes which are naturally distasteful to the people. The Council beganADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF by 'fevying ' octroi' on produce coming into town from up-country; the pro ceeds, However, were promptly converted by the Kalantar of Bushire to his own use. It contemplated an extensive scheme of repairs to the bazaars and pub lic tliorbughf ares and the lighting of the streets, and it also attempted to regu late the price of bread and meat in the local bazaars by the establishment of municipal shops selling at cheap prices, other butchers and bakers being for bidden to sell higher. Few of the above schemes, however, matured and the net result was a slight cleaning up of the streets and a distinct increase in the price of the commodities above-mentioned. Local Police. —The local police of Bushire, some 30 men, before controlled by the Kalantar were, on the arrival of the new Rais-i-Nazmieh from Tehran, placed under the orders of that official. As already stated above, he found considerable difficulty in raising the funds necessary for their maintenance and is said to be contemplating the levy of a tax on opium and ' arrak ' in order to do so. His arrival was viewed with the greatest disfavour by the Kalantar who foresaw the loss of the many perquisites accruing to the office of the ' Chietf of Police ' hitherto held by himself. Local Garrison. —The local forces at the disposal of the Governor at the TDeginning of the year were supposed to be— 500 Infantry, . 150 Artillery men, 100 Sowars; that is to say, these were the numbers for which payment was made by the Central Government. Not half, however, were ever enrolled, and those that were performed few military duties, the majority making a living as petty merchants and traders in the local bazaar. The infantry recruited from Ispahan, after a fruitless endeavour to obtain payment of the amount due to them on account of arrears of pay and ration money for seven months and their clothing allowances for three years, took hast in the Residency. While negotiations were in progress with the various officials concerned with a view to a settlement of their grievances and the speedy removal of the Sarbazes, the latter announced that they had received permission by telegram from Tehran to quit Bushire and were going to act on that permission pending settlement of their claims. This they accordingly did, leaving Bushire with their Chief, the Amir Panj, during the middle of August. The Artillerymen of Bushire for a similar reason, viz., non-payment of their salaries, took hast m the Customs House. A compromise was eventually arranged by His Excellency the Governor. Bushire and the surrounding districts. —Local tribal conditions in the dis- ' ^ ^ tricts surrounding Bushire were the cause on ition of ountry. 0 f considerable anxiety at different periods during the past year, a descent on Bushire similar to that of 1909 be ing more than once anticipated. The primary cause of the trouble was the feud existing between Shaikh Hussein Chahkutai and his brothers, the latter claiming that the villages of Abu Tawil, Tul-i-Ashki and Kanar Abadi should be given them to live in, and the former declining to do so. Shaikh Hussein was backed by the Darya Begi while the cause of the brothers was espoused by Zair Khadhar, Chief of Tangistan, who was already at feud with Shaikh Hussein on the question of the support given by the latter to Hyder Khan, ex- Chief of Tangistan, who had been driven from his territories by the present Chief. In the course of the feud Shaikh Hussein killed one of his brothers, Ali by name, in cold blood and hostilities started on the 26th July with an attack on the village of Chaghadak by the other brothers who were assisted by Zair Khadhar. On the 9th August the Darya Begi took the field in person with a force of two guns and some 150 men. Fighting of a kind topk place daily, and the firing could be distinctly heard from Bushire. The Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, Ilkhani of the Kashgais, is believed to have intervened at this stage on behalf of Zair Khadhar and to have directed Moghis-ud-DowI'eh (Deputy Governor of Dashti and Dashtistan and the Nizam-us- Sultaneh's Agent) to devise means for the return of the Darya Begipolitical residency foe 1910 15 to Bushire. Be this as. lU may, Zair Khadhar and His EKoellency erentually came to terms which, however satisfactory they may have been to themselv^ left Shaikh Hussein completely at the mercy of his enemies, by whom' he wS forced to concede all the points originally demanded of him by his brothers the latter being given the three villages already referred to above, and. Shaikh Hussein being left with Ahmedi, The result of this expedition was to lea™ Zair Khadhar and his langistams all powerful in the districts surrounding Bushire without in apy way settling the quarrel on account of which thl Da S a St 81 ? o d 0 f ten l slbl y His Excellency returned to 'Bushire on the 9th of September and left shortly afterwards for Bandar Ablm,&lt;. As soon as he had left, Zair Khadhar sent m demanding a, sum o£ tomans 2 000 from the Kalantar of Bushire and one Zair Haji, Shaikh Hussein'a Agent by way of fine for the assKtance they, had given. Shaikh Hussein during the late hostilities and announced his intention of coming, when opportunity offered to take the money by force in the event of a refusal. He was taken seriously by the populace and measures were at once taken by the local authorities, under telegraphic instructions from His Excellency, to meet the expected attack, and arrangements were made with the Khan of Bandar Rig for the supply of re inforcements. Zair Khadhar on hearing the above wrote in denying all hostile intention whatsoever as regards Bushire. He added that he had been offered the Kalantarship of Bushire by the Sowlet, but had declined the same. There can be little doubt that at this period the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh was posing to Zair Khadhar as having obtained some promise of or interest in the Governorship of Bushire, and had put up the Tangistani Chief to endeavour to insinuate himself into the Kalantarship of Bushire in order to work in his interests. The number of Tangistani wandering about Bushire, at this time was about 100; the Kadkhoda of Bushire was also a Tangistani, and had an influential Tangistani become Kalantar also, Bushire would have been entirely administered by the Tangistani element and a very inconvenient situation would have resulted. The third occasion on which the contingency of a descent on Bushire was the cause of some lively anxiety was in connection with the activity, already referred to above, displayed by the Customs Department in preventing smug- gUng. Not satisfied with the revenge already taken in the shape of the mur der of the Customs Mudirs, the Dashti Khans collected at Ahram, Zair Khadhar's head-quarters, and announced their intention of marching on Bushire with a view to sacking the Customs. The Governor, professing to be lieve that these reports might be well founded, on the 23rd November moved some 4 miles out and camped at Mukam with one gun and 80 men. After communicating with Zair Khadhar and, obtaining assurances of his good intentions he returned to Bushire, on the 27th November, and eventually induced the Tangistani Chief to come in himself and interview the Director of Customs. While in Bushire, His Excellency and Zair Khadhar are said to have formed a secret compact with each other and Ahmed Khan Angali, who has always been a sti^png supporter of Zair Khadhar, to resist the Sowlet-ud- Dowleh, should the latter attempt any hostile action against the Darya Begi or Zair Khadhar. Sowlet-ud-Dowleh?s visit to Bushive. —The Sowlet-ud-Dowleh arrived on 29th of December much to the concern of the Darya Begi who had received dis tinct assurances from'the Central Government that the Ilkhani would not cross the boundaries of Ears. The Sowlet was accompanied by some three to four hundred Kashgai followers, and nearly every Khan of local importance in the surrounding country, each with a tribal following of his own in addition. It is estimated that at one time there were close on 1,200 tribesmen on the penin sula. The immediate cause for this gathering of the clans was the expected arrival of the newly appointed Governor-General of Ears, Nizam-ud-Sultaneh r who, however, did not reach Bushire till the beginning of January 1911. In view of the apprehension expressed by the Darya Begi at the daily increasing number of tribesmen present, and the fact that petty acts of trespass and pil fering had already begun to be rife, the Eirst Assistant was instructed (by wireless) by the Resident, who was away at Debai, to visit both the Sowlet and16 ADMINISTRATION REPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF the Darya Begi and give them friendly warning on his behalf that experience of the past showed that the presence of large numbers of tribesmen on the island, of various denominations, invariably led to lawlessness, and eventual danger to Europeans, and that on the first symptoms of this, troops would be landed as in 1909. Both parties replied with friendly assurances that they would take all possible steps to keep the tribesmen in hand and to give no cause for apprehension. National Activities. —No very great display of nationalist activities took place during the year. At the instance of Mullas and others of Tehran and Resht, and as a pro test against the presence of Russian troops on Persian soil, no festivities took place on the Naoroz and this in spite of the fact that it fell, for the first time in many years, after the end of the mourning months of Moharrum and Safar. A telegram was received from Tehran during the first week of April to the effect that the negotiations in connection with the Anglo-Russian loan had fallen through, owing to the imposition of conditions impossible of acceptance, and that an international loan was contemplated. A meeting of some of the principal merchants was thereupon held, and some 60,000 tomans promised towards a national fund. Beyond, however, telegraphing news of their pro mised donations for information to Tabriz, no action appears to have been taken. Spasmodic efforts seem to have been made about this period by the Central Government to discover new sources of revenue, a Government monopoly in the sale of salt and intestines being apparently at one time contemplated. The monopoly for the latter, it may be mentioned, had hitherto been held by a Russian subject. News of the British note to Persia, of October 14th, was received with al most complete indifference in Bushire, the only form of protest evoked being the despatch of a telegram, prepared by the disreputable Mirza Ali Kazeruni, already referred to above, and signed by certain of the Ulema, merchants and others, to Shiraz, asking their compatriots to request the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh not to give any cause for Foreign interference in Persia and to preserve the peace. The close of the year was marked by the committal of a series of lawless acts against various members of the Residency Staff. Thus, a robbery took place at the house of Dr. Turner, Assistant Surgeon, on the night of Novem ber 9th. The private premises of Mr. Gandhy, Superintendent of the Resi dency Office, were entered, on 25th November, by two armed men, one of whom, on being challenged by Mr. Gandhy, fired a shot through his bed-room door and decamped. Next a robbery was committed on the 19th December in the house of one of the Residency Clerks, and another on the 27th in that of the Residency Surgeon, property to the value of £75 being carried off in the latter case. It was difficult to know how to deal with these cases. It was noticeable that all the victims of these acts of lawlessness were members of the British Residency. No one else was complaining, and there were strong grounds for believing that they were engineered by enemies of the Darya Begi with the express object of discrediting his government and bring ing about his removal. Similar inconvenient use of the Residency has frequently been made in the past and, to have made much of the incidents in Tehran, would have been to play into the hands of the instigators of them. It was considered, best therefore to disappoint the intriguers concerned, and, if the Darya Begi ren dered it possible, to settle matters locally with him. His Excellency took steps to have guards placed, or the vicinity of the dwellings of members of the Residency patrolled at night for a time, and gradually paid up the compensa tion demanded. A subsequent attack on him by the ' Habl-el-Matin ' for servilely paying this compensation lends additional colour to the theory that the incidents, which now ceased altogether, had been ' put up.'POLITICAL RESIDENCY PGR 1910. 17 Owing to the constant state of unrest existing in Shiraz and along the British Commerce and the Bushire-Shiraz Bushiie-Shiraz routes in the Spring, Eoad - . . summer, and autumn, and the frequent caravan robberies occurring thereon, the market for British goods between Bushire and Ispahan continued to be very poor, while the frequent congestion of merchandise m transit at intermediate points, owing to the dangers of the road, further spoilt prices. Muleteers moreover were heavily taxed by the road-side Khans, and the price of transport at the beginning of the year reached the record figure of 310 krans per 775 lbs. to Shiraz only, though it fell to 200 krans in June, and stood at 150 krans at the end of the year. Mules also were comparatively scarce. The caravan route was arbi trarily changed several times during the year. In January and in February the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, Ilkhani of the Kashgais, having undertaken to certain merchants in Shiraz to hold himself responsible for the security of any cara van route passing through his tribal territory, altered the route to be used by muleteers three times within a few weeks, to tracks via the Tang-i-Kalimeh, then via Husseinabad and Tang-i-Ram respectively, and finally fixed on the Jirreh-Sar-Mashhad-Daliki road. The Firuzabad route was also used a little. The frequency of robberies in the autumn in the neighbourhood of Shiraz gave rise to the British note of October 14th. After receipt of this note arrangements were come to by the Central Government with the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh by which the latter was put in charge of the Kazerun (Telegraph or Shahi) route which was to be declared open to traffic and its safety guaranteed by the Kashgai Chief. By the time, however, that this arrangement was announced, the passes were blocked with snow and it has not therefore been possible to ascertain how far the Sowlet would have been able to give effect to his undertaking. About £20,000 worth of recent British commercial claims remain un satisfied. Owing to this conglomeration of unfavourable conditions, about £300,000 of' trade left the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan route, and was diverted to the Lynch Road via Ahwaz, but the congestion which resulted on that route caused merchants even to forward goods to Ispahan via Baghdad! The increase of trade, noticeable in Mohammerah and Ahwaz statistics, to a cor responding extent, has resulted. The credit of small traders remained very shaky throughout the year and several bankruptcies occurred. A rainfall of 15 inches, and the subsequent fine crop produced on the coast-districts were estimated to provide a surplus of 16,000 tons, and led to a welcome revival in export trade in the autumn of 1911, and about 1,500 tons were exported. Still heavier exports are in prospect this year and this may result in a revival of business. British refined sugar has made excellent headway in the Gulf generally since its introduction in 1909. Russian Interests. —Two steamers of the Odessa Line called at Bushire twice each during 1910. The total im- Foreign interests. port was 358 packages and one steamer only exported cargo, namely, 17 packages tobacco from Ispahan. The imports, save for occasional packages of cotton and dried lemons, consisted almost entirely of China and glassware* of Russian manufacture, mainly samples. The insecurity of the roads between Ispahan and Bushire during the earlier part of the year compelled the Company to send the Persian ' tam- baku,' of which they have the land and sea carrying contract, to Ahwaz instead of to Bushire for shipment. But so little business was done locally by the Company that, in the begin ning of the year, the Russian Agent was transferred to Port Said on Consular Service and a Persian gentleman left in charge, who also acts as Dragoman to the French Consul. In September a new agent was appointed, this time a well-known Maskat arms-dealer named Wram, apparently of Levantine extraction, who, however, vanished again within a month, the Acting Russian D18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Consul-General having informed the Company that Wram was not a fit per son and that his appointment would only bring them into disrepute. Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co. made an offer in the course of the year to obtain the contract for the 'tambaku,' but the Society du Tombac in Con stantinople did not respond and, furthermore, the ocean rates offered by the Russian line were too low to admit of competition on other than a subsidy basis. German Interests. —Full details of the imports by the Hamburg-Amerika Line are only to hand for 8 ships out of the 11 which called at this port in 1910. These eight ships brought 22,927 packages from Hamburg and Ant werp as compared with 10,234 packages brought by 7 ships during 1909 or an increase of 96 per cent, for a period comprising the greater part of the year. The increase is accounted for by a cargo of 11,097 cases of kerosine landed by one steamer and denotes no extension of trade. It may be men tioned that reports from other places in the Gulf also speak of a general increase of some 75 per cent. The exports from Bushire by 6 vessels, between January and June 1910, amounted to 155 tons, and though the statistics of cargo of the other 5 vessels are not yet available, it is known that little can be added to the above figures. On arrival at Bushire, on the 18th May, of the Hamburg-Amerika Line S. S. ' Cheruskia,' the Agents, Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co., hoisted on their office a new flag having the lion and the sun on a blue ground in one corner and the star and crescent on a red ground on the other, the two devices being separated by a white strip bearing the initials of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. The nature of the new design being obviously semi-political, enquiry was made from the Karguzar as to whether, contrary to the usage of the past, it was now permissible for merchants to fly personal house flags, whereupon that official drew the attention of the German Company to the irregularity, and the flag has not since been flown. The German firm of Wonckhaus &amp; Co. withdrew in the spring its German representative from Bushire, as the small amount of business trans acted did not repay the outlay. They left their Persian broker, Haji Muhammad Hussein by name, in charge of their Agency. Owing, however, to his personal antagonism with Mirza Hussein, the Dragoman of the German Consulate, and to the loss of 8,500 tomans sent in native sailing craft by Haj i Muhammad Hussein for the purchase of wheat in the districts near Bushire, and to the suspicion thrown upon Haji Muhammad Hussein of havmg robbed the money, the latter absconded from Bushire in September and fled to Dilwar in Tangistan, where he remained till the end of the year. It appeared also that Haji Muhammad Hussein was heavily indebted to the firm on past accounts, although at the same time he was their chief in strument of business in Bushire. The German firm were thus heavily hit tt an&lt; ^ one P artne ^ s ' ^ r ; Thomas Brown, (a British subject) ^ r^ r rum P e ^ er came to Bushire to investigate matters. Mirza Hussein, the German Dragoman above-mentioned, thereupon got himself temporarily put m charge of the German Firm's office. The whole affair, and subsequent ofThe fim bcally^ ^ 1911 ' donsiderabl y dama ged the reputation During the year Mr. Wonckhaus, who remained in Europe, dissolved partnerslnp with Messrs. Traun Strucken &amp; Co., of Hamburg, his financiers, who had quarrelled with him regarding the management of their business in he bulr : and Mr. Wonckhaus sought fresh financial support in London and Hamburg finally obtaining it from the banker Jawbsen. A member of the Beit family of South African connection is also understood to have a consi- derable vested interest in the firm. Turkish Interests. Considerable activity has been shown by the TurkisK Oonsul in calling upon his nationalists residing in Bushire to undergo mili tary service at Baghdad. The persons most affected are the Baghdad Christ ian employes of the Customs Department. His Excellency the Darya Begi, while on a visit to Jask at the end of Arms Traffic. February, was pressed by our Intelli- TriinTu nu- 4? -c-rv 1. , ^ence Officer to deport Mir Barkat ivnan, Chief of Biyaban, and one of those most deeply implicated in the illicitPOLITICAL EESIDENCY FOE 1910. 19 arms traffic through Mekran. The Darya Begi agreed to comply and, having in due course inveigled Mir Barkat on to the ' Persepolis,' he took him first to Bandar Abbas and from thence, under a good deal of pressure from the Eesident who ^ was then coming up the Gulf on his return from leave, sent him on in the ' Persepolis ' to Bushire to await his arrival. Meanwhile Mir Barkat was kept under surveillance. On the Darya Begi's return towards the end of March, the Resident discussed with His Excellency the best means of dealing with Mir Barkat. As a free-booter and an arms trader, every body s sympathies were with him, and it was feared that any pressure on the Persian Government to award him specific punishment would be met with the reply tjia^ there had been no trial, that Mir Barka^t professed to have serious grievances, and in, orde? tb^t his case might be gone Into and disposed of, it was necessary that he should be called to Tehran. Once in Tehran, it was known that he would be in a position to pull strings and make difficulties for us and the Governor of the Gulf Poyts, It was therefore decided that it would be better to content ourselves with such measures as the Darya Begi could be got to take against him locally. His Excellency, after some discus sion, formally agreed to keep Mir Barkat under strict surveillance at Bushire until such time as he and the British authorities should agree that he might be released. Mir Barkat however from the first chafed greatly at being left in Persian custody and sent repeated appeals to the Resident to be allowed to return to his country : to these however no ear could be lent. Eventually,, on the 27th of August, taking advantage of the absence of the Governor in Tangistan and the corrupt ability or gross negligence of the Deputy Governor, he made his escape by night across to the mainland and had 24 hours start before his escape was reported. He made his way successfully back to his country, 400 miles away, being treated as an honoured guest and good sportsman by all the petty headmen en route. A heavy smuggling trade in arms was carried on during the year chiefly through the small ports south-east of Bushire, especially Dilwar. The arms are all absorbed locally and it is not considered that at present any of these reach Afghanistan or the Indian frontier. The Customs Department so far as circumstances permit do their best to check this traffic, and information of any intended shipment which reaches this Residency is immediately com municated to the Director, but they have not got the force at their back to cope with smuggling effectively. Forty-five slaves who had taken refuge ave ra e ' at Bushire, Shargah, Lingah, Charbar and Bahrain were manumitted during the year. The results of the daily observations Observatory. are recorded in tabular statements Nos. 1 and 2 attached. The Resident had the R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' to meet him at Maskat, on Tourg his way out from home in March, and ours ' called at Jask, Bandar Abbas and Lin gah on the way up. He visited Bahrain and the Trucial Coast in August and the Trucial Coast again in December. Visits to Mohammerah 'and Kuwait were paid in April and October. His Excellency Rear-Admiral E. J. W. Slade, M.V.O., arrived at Visit of His Excellency the Naval Com- Bushire in the R. I. M. S. ' Lawrence ' mander-in-chief. on the 8th December. He left for the Shatt-el-Arab, on the 14th, returning again on the 18th. On 26th His Ex cellency left suddenly for Debai with the Resident in H. M. S. ' Hyacinth ' arriving on the 28th December in connection with the attack made on a party from H. M. S. ' Hyacinth ' who had been landed in search of arms. The Flagship returned to Bushire on 2nd January, and His Excellency finally proceeded down the Gulf on 8th January. • , P. Z.

Bushire from 28th March to 1st July during which period there were 62 cases and 46 deaths. Great difficulty was experienced with the populace in connection with the detection of cases. On the one hand nervous busybodies constantly reported that ' a case of plague is being concealed in so and so s house ' and it was difficult to ignore such reports. On the other handj householders strongly resented their houses being visited. There was also an outbreak of cholera at Mohammerah lasting from 3rd November to the 22nd November during which period there were 61 cases with 22 deaths.

Deputy Governors. —There have been many changes of Deputy Governors At the beginning of the year Ikhtedar-e-Nizam was Deputy Governor He was relieved by Mirza Mahmud, Shirazi, at the end of February, who retained the office until September when he was seized and made a prisoner, for, it was alleged, attempting to shoot His Excellency the Darya Begi, but it is thought that His Excellency was liberally bribed by the merchants of Lingah to remove Mirza Mahmud. Ikhtedar-e-Nizam was re-appointed Deputy Governor in October and was dismissed in December for allowing the British force to land and assist in the defence of the town against an expected attack by Warawis. Mansur-i-Diwan was appointed Deputy Governor, in December, and has retained the appointment up to the close of the year. Karguzars—At the beginning of the year the post was vacant. Wasook-es-Sultan was appointed Karguzar in April. He died on the 10th October, and the duties were carried on by his son, Muhammad Hussein, whose appointment was officially recognized in November. Muhammad Hussein retained the appointment up to the end of the year. Turkish. —Khan Bahadur Agha Bader, British Residency Agent, was Consul New who retained charge till the end of the year. Russian. —Sadeed-es-Sultan, Agent of the Russian Consulate-General, visited Lingah for a fortnight in December. Maskat and Oman. —Muhammad Tahnun has retained the position of Agent to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, throughout the year. Anjuman. —A local assembly o^ —^ — — 1 1 of Messrs. Jamshidian &amp; Co. at its head, held meetings at the com mencement of the year. In February the assembly were invited by His Excellency the Darya Begi to appoint and send a representative to Bushire, but this was not done. In June His Excellency the Darya Begi officially recognized the existence or the assembly^ to work in co-operation with the Deputy Governor, and to transact Municipal business. Something was done towards cleaning the roads, a small house-tax being levied to cover the expenses, but, in October, the assembly was dismissed, since when no meetings have been held. Early in the year many members of the so-called Anjuman Baladi took possession of plots of land for building, to the north of the town, which were carefully marked off with stones.

REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOB 1910. 28 was called to discuss certain proposals put forward by the Director of Cus toms at Bushire. It was proposed to establish bonded warehouses, to be erected by local merchants, for goods imported for transhipment, which would enter and leave the Port duty free, paying only the ordinary office dues for import and export papers plus 2 per cent, to cover the cost of the extra super vision entailed. The merchants however thought this would be little or no advantage and rejected the proposal. They held out for a reduction in the Tariff to 5 per cent, ad valorem as the only means of reviving trade at Lingah. Smuggling. —Tea, coffee, and arms are smuggled on the Coast to the West and East of Lingah with comparative ease, and, although the Customs launch ' Khorasan ' has made many trips on the Coast, no captures have been made. Condition of Country. Shil Kuh Districts.—The Coastal Districts to the West of Lingah known as Shib Kuh are split up into the following groups :— District. Islands. Shaikh or Chief. Moghu Including the Island of Farur . Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Rashid Marzooqi (deceased) succeeded by Shaikh Sultan in December. Charak Including the Islands of Gaiz Shaikh Saleh bin Muhammad AI Ali. Taona Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahman. Kalat Shaikh Ibrahim bin Abdulla Hamadi. Cheroo Including the Island of Hinderabi Shaikh Abdulla Abaidali. Mugam Including the Island of Shaikh Shuaib Shaikh Ahmed Hamadi. Revenues are mostly paid to Fars, through the Khan of Bastak as de scribed in the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, the only alterations being in re spect to the Charak and Taona districts. The former Shaikh continues to pay 850 tomans per annum, repitesenting the revenue of Gaiz Island, to the Khan of Bastak, while the revenue of the Charak district (1,410 tomans per annum) is paid to the Governor-General at Bushire. The Taona Shaikh also pays 140 tomans per annum to the Governor-General at Bushire. Shaikh Ahmed bin Rashid Marzooqi of Moghu died in December and was succeeded by his eldlest son Shaikh Sultan. All Shib Kuh Shaikhs, except perhaps the Shaikhs of Cheroo and Taona, are disposed to be very friendly to the British. In September a fracas occurred between the Shaikhs of Moghu and Charak districts and both parties indulged in petty acts of piracy which fizzled out when they were warned by His Majesty's Vice-Consul that their action entailed serious consequences. Warawis. —In the middle of October news was received that the Chiefs of the Warawi, Gaobandi, and Ishkanu districts, lying to the westward of Mugam, had collected a large force for the purpose of a raid on Shib Kuh, with Lingah as their objective. Further news of the advance of the attack ing force necessitated the presence of a ship at Lingah for the protection of the lives and property of foreign subjects. H. M. S. ' Fox ' arrived on the 24th October. Ax the time the town guard consisted of 10 tofangchis, which number was supplemented by 60 from Bandar Abbas. The entire popula tion was much alarmed. Money was freely subscribed by the merchants to build 10 stone Sangars on the outskirts of the town as a defence against attack. By the 27th October the Warawi force had captured the passes lead- into Shib Kuh territory, which the Shaikh of Mugam endeavoured to24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP defend, .and advanced to Bulaskar (17 miles north-west of Charak). In the meantime Sheikh Mazkoor of Gaobandi had brought a strong force by sea from Bandar Shiu and landed at Cheroo, the Shaikh of which place did every thing in his power to assist the attacking force. On the same day (27th October) the Deputy Governor of Lingah, realiz • ing the hopelessness of defending the town with the scant number of tofang- chis at his disposal, proceeded on board H. M. S. ' Fox ' and requested Captain Hunt to assist him. One hundred and seventy-four officers and men were landed from H. M. S. ' Fox ' and ' Odin,' and an effective scheme of defence was drawn up by Captain Hunt in co-operation with the Deputy Governor. H. M. S. ' Odin ' was detailed to patrol the Shib Kuh Coast, and, on the 31st October, she encountered three dhows at Jazza, belonging to Shaikh Mazkoor, containing loot taken by him from the seaports of Mugam district. While overhauling the dhows, the ship was fired on by a party of Shaikh Mazkoor's men on shore. The dhows were captured and brought to Lingah; two of which were proved (to belong to Shaikh Mazkoor were burnt, and the third dhow subsequently found to belong to a subject of Mugam, was returned to the Shaikh, with all the loot contained in the three dhows, valued at about Rs. 8,000. His Excellency the Darya Begi arrived at Lingah from Bandar Abbas on the 1st November, and concurred with .the action taken by Captain Hunt iin co-operation with the Deputy Governor for the defence of Lingah. He proceeded to Charak and remained there till the 7th November, his time being occupied in collecting fighting material from the Shaikhs of Charak and Moghu, and in writing polite letters to the Warawis requesting their with drawal. In a letter to the Warawis His Excellency is said to have congra tulated them for punishing the people of Mugam! His Excellency moved on to Rust ami (15 miles north-east of Charak) on the 8 th November where he joined Muhammed Reza Khan, son of the Chief of Bastak, bringing his fight ing strength up to about one thousand, but it is regretted he had no intention of fighting and punishing the intruders, although he was pressed to do so by the Shaikhs accompanying him. The expedition resolved itself merely into a tour through the country from Charak to Mugam, and this was only under taken after ascertaining that the W^arawis intended to withdraw. Moreover, it is regrettable that His Excellency failed to inflict any punishment on Shaikh Mazkoor for his impudent act of piracy. The latter did not withdraw with the Warawi force but remained at Armaki, only a few miles south of His Excellency's route. The property plundered by the Warawis and Shaikh Mazkoor was estimated by the Shaikh of Mugam at five lakhs of rupees, but this is undoubtedly an exaggeration. Bastak. —In April the Khan of Bastak, Muhammed Takhi Khan, Sowlet- ul-Mulk, held up a caravan travelling from Lar to Lingah and also a caravan proceeding in the opposite direction. On representations being made by the merchants of Lingah, both the caravans were released. Looting of cattle by the bill robbers has been frequent throughout the year, and the road to Bastak, short as it is, has not been safe for caravans. Lar District—The district has beefn in a state of chaos throughout the year. In February the Governor of Lar, Saifulla Khan, made an attempt to collect outstanding revenues and restore order, but he was attacked and de feated by Bahlui Rohhers. He fled to Shiraz, and since then the appointment has not been filled by a representative of the Ears Government. After this incident Muhammad Hussein Khan, Rasulkhani, constituted himself Governor of Lar and carried on a rule of tyranny and extortion till the end of August, when he was turned out by Seyyid Baba of Bairam who became Governor of the district by special request of the merchants of Lar, who guaranteed to pay him 1,200 tomans per mensem to defend the town. This arrangement continued up to the close of the year. In August, news was received that Jalal-e-din Mirza had left Shiraz with a strong force to take up the Governorship of Lar and restore order.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 25 He apparently advanced as far as Darab (100 miles north -west of Lar) where be was attacked by Bahluis.

In all probability many more small consignments have been smuggled.i 0 i 20 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The Shaikhs on the Shib Kuh Coast were warned against fostering Afghans or implicating themselves in the traffic, but they undoubtedly profit by it, and naturally endeavour to suppress information of landings in their districts. A check has been kept of Afghans passing through Lingah, the total numbering 59 during the year, who mostly arrived by land from Bandar Abbas. Many cross by boat to the Arab Coast and others purchase what rifles they can locally. * The district of Lingah and Shib Kuh is not favourably situated, from an Afghan gun-runner's point of view, on account of its inaccessibility, and it is not thought that the traffic will develop to any great extent in this quarter. In November it was reported that Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Haji Abdurahman Kazim, and Abdulla Giladari, had formed a Syndicate for the purpose of trading in arms, but since then no further particulars about the combination have come to light. During the year 26 slaves took refuge in the Vice-Consulate. One appli cation was refused, and 17 were manu- siave Traffic. .mitted, while 2 disappeared during enquiry into their cases. The remaining 6 cases are still pending enquiry. Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Ca—Mr. J. Daniels was in charge of the firm up to the end of June A when he was relieved British interests. Mr. D. Hart. As Commission Agents the firm's business at Lingah has increased considerably during the year, in the latter part of which a number of additional clients have been acquired, many of whom formerly dealt exclusively with the German firm. Arrangements are being made and every facility offered, for the firm to participate in the pearl shell trade during the coming season. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. —Mr. Brown, a British subject, who has _ . been in charge of the firm at Lingah for omgn nterests. many years, left for Basrah early in March. The management devolved on Herr H. Rosenfeld who was absent on leave from June to December, being relieved in the meantime by Herr Krumpeter. Mr. Randall, a British subject, who is an assistant in the firm, has been here throughout the year. Mr. Brown visited Lingah for a fort night in November. The firm are Agents of the Hamburg Amerika Steam Ship Company. Their export trade is in pearl shells, asafoetida and linseed, while imports are chiefly sugar, kerosine oil and vermicelli. The firm's business shows a very big decline during the last half-year. Practically nothing was imported, and their exports amount to only one quarter of the quantity shipped during the first half-year. Hamburg Amerika Steam Shif Co. —During the year 10 steamers from Hamburg called at the port, bringing a total of 11,806 packages. On the homeward voyage only 6 of these steamers called, the total cargo shipped being 5,895 packages, which includes 5,447 bags of pearl shells. Russian Steam Navigation Co. —Four steamers from Odessa called at the port during the year, bringing a total of 69 packages. These four steamers also called on the homeward voyage, the total cargo shipped being 2,201 packages, which includes 1,444 bundles of tobacco for Aden. Miscellaneous. His Majesty's Yice-Consul. —Mr. R. H. New joined his appointment on the 29th March and retained charge for the remainder of the year. Tours by Yice-Consul. —His Majesty's Vice-Consul made a tour, in No vember, by H. M. S. ' Odin,' visiting the Islands of Abu Musa, Gaiz, and Shaikh Shuaib, and the Shib Kuh ports of Mugam, Kaiat, Charak and Moghu. His Majesty's Vice-Consul also went to Debai in the R. I. M. S.

Several cases of Bright's disease were also attended. R. H. NEW, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Lingah. Lingah, The 10th April 1911.CHAPTER III. ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE BANDAR ABBAS VICE- CONSULATE FOR THE YEAR 1910. The districts of Bandar Abbas and Minab have shared in the general disorder prevailing in Southern Persia during the past year : there has bfeen an entire absence of control by the Government of Ears over the inhabitants of .the South-Eastern portion of that Province, and the local authorities of B.andar Abbas have displayed little willingness or ability to maintain order beyond the immediate vicinity of the port. The most noteworthy disturban ces occurred in March and October, and on each occasion the prime^ movers came from Ears jurisdiction, and with them a certain number of the inhabit ants of Shamil and other places in the Bandar Abbas district joined forces. On the first occasion His Excellency Darya Begi was at Bandar Abbas living in the Kollah Eiringhi, when a force of some 300 men, under the leadership of one Hussein Kallah Kan, a follower of the notorious Seyyid Abdul Hussein of Lar, entered the town, overcame a somewhat feeble resist ance offered by the local forces, and took possession of the Kollah Eeringhi. Eor the moment His Excellency's situation appeared somewhat critical, as it was doubtful what the intention of the assailants were : money, however, as usual, proved its efficacy as a solvent of such difficulties, and on payment of 500 tomans and an assurance that they would be allowed to depart unmolested, the robbers left the .town. The disturbances, in October, were considerably more serious, heavy losses being sustained by both British subjects and the Persian inhabitants of the district. Here again the principal agents were Baharlu sowars from Ears, but they were ably supported by men belonging to Assadullah Khan and Nasarullah Khan, two well-known free-booters of Shamil. The troubles again coincided with the presence of Darya Begi in this district: His Ex cellency arrived at the end of September and proceeded almost at once to Minab, which had for some time been in a disturbed condition, and it was while he was there that the raiders entered Shamil. They overran the entire district, carrying off herds, flocks, grain, and property of every description. Two caravans, carrying large consignments of goods belonging to British Indian subjects to Kerman, were looted and goods to the total value of nearly half a lakh of rupees were carried off. The raiders did not actually attack the town but villages at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from the port were looted, and one or two of the inhabitants killed. His Excellency Darya Begi how ever returned from Minab just as things were beginning to look rather criti cal, and the robbers retired leisurely towards Ears. Minab was formerly leased to the Moin-ut-Tujjar, but, at the beginning of the year, the Persian Government resumed control of it. For some months there was no recognised authority there, as the Moin's agent vacated his post, and the Central Government appointed no successor. Finally, however, an order was received from the Central Government making Minab an appanage of Bandar Abbas. Since then there have been a rapid succession of nominees of the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas there, each more incapable than the last. There are large claims by British subjects against certain Minabis, the chief creditor being one Ali Khan, a large landowner and a man of con siderable means. The Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas, Misbah-i-Diwan, as soon as Minab was put under his jurisdiction, proceeded there with a large force of ' tufangchis ' to collect revenue and effect a settlement of the claims. It appears probable that had he approached Ali Khan peaceably, the latter would have been both able and willing to make some effort to meet his liabil ities : Ali Khan however, not unnaturally perhaps, took fright at the approach'ADMN. REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 29 of the Misbah with a large force, joined forces with several Rudbari and Rud- ani Khans, and several affrays took place between them and the Misbah's men. The condition of Minab remained extremely disturbed during August £ind September when His Excellency Darya Begi proceeded there: Darya Begi was compelled to return to Bandar Abbas, in October, owing to the Baharlu raid, but Misban-i-Diwan was subsequently again sent to Minab with about 150 tufangchis, and finally succeeded in driving off Ali Khan and his support ers : since then no further disturbances have occurred there. The Misban-i- Diwan's action however was extremely unfortunate: so far from any British claims being settled, the whole district remained in an extremely disturbed condition for three months, many petty robberies took place, and gardens were destroyed etc., though fortunately no serious depredations were reported. Moreover Ali Khan, who, if properly handled, would probably have proved fairly tractable, has been practically converted into an outlaw, whose main object is to revenge himself on the Deputy Governor. At the opening of the year Mullah Abdul Rahman, Misbah-i-Diwan was T , ^ , Deputy Governor, but early in January, Local officials. . i as the result of some complaints made against him by one or two influential merchants in connection with a case in which they were claimants, he was dismissed, and took ' bast ' at the Consu late. There was a temporary interregnum until the arrival of the Darya Begi, at the end of February, when Mansur-i-Diwan, His Excellency's Ferash- Bashi, was nominally appointed Deputy Governor. His Excellency remained here till 2nd June and before leaving made peace between the merchants and the Misbah-i-Diwan, and reinstated the latter. He has remained Deputy Governor up to the close of the year. He is extremely venal and corrupt, and quite unscrupulous where profit to himself is concerned : at the same time he is possessed of a good deal of ability of a rough-and-ready kind, and is the only man in the place capable of maintaining order, as has been several times shown. He is moreover friendly disposed towards the Consulate, and willing to co-operate in any matter which does not affect his own pocket. A somewhat anxious situation was created here at the beginning of the year. Therewere then some 300 Afghans here, and, owing to the effectiveness of the measures taken for the suppression of the illicit traffic in arms, their attitude to the Consulate became openly hostile. The Consular guard was accordingly increased, at the end of January, to 30 men, and the Afghans were given notice to leave the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas within a week. The presence of a man-of-war in the harbour induced them to comply with this order, and they left for the interior within the specified period. They subsequently had several affrays with Bashakardis and others on their way up country, a thing which, from our point of view, is in no way to be regretted, as it renders the people of the country through which they have to pass on their way to the coast actively hostile to them. In September orders were received that the Government of India had sanctioned a grant for certain alterations which would render the Consulate buildings more easily defensible. These altera tions were commenced before the end of the year, and arrangements were made for strengthening the Consulate guard at short notice. Up to the end of the year, however, no Afghan caravans had reached Bandar Abbas. In November an underground connection was made between the cable- house and the Consulate, with a view to Telegraphs. preventing communication being at any time interrupted by the cutting of the aerial wire. Charge of the Consulate was held by Captain M. E. Rae, I.A., up to the „ . ., ^ 2nd May 1909, when he proceeded on ntis 0Ilsulate - furlough to England. He was relieved by Captain H. V. Biscoe who remaned in charge till the close of the year.

It was Kawam-ul-Mulk's intention either to induce the Khans of Baluchistan to submit to the Persian Government or to attempt the reconquest of the pro vince, and he interviewed some of the Khans in Bam, but to no purpose. At length, harassed and disgusted by Nusrat-us-Sultan's intrigues against him in Kerman, he abandoned his attempt at restoring order in Baluchistan and the intention of resuming his duties in Kerman, and withdrew to Sirj an, telegraphing to Tehran his resignation of his appointment. After some delay his resignation was accepted and in the middle of June he left Sirjan for Shiraz, without returning to Kerman. Sardar-i-Jang, the Bakhtiari Governor of, Yezd, was temporarily ap pointed Governor of Kerman, as well as Yezd, but he neither visited Kerman nor interfered, to any appreciable extent, in the administration. The gov ernment remained in the hands of Nusrat-us-Sultan with whom the local heads of departments were nominally associated. The combination, which took its tone from its leaders, was powerless for good but an effective organ of obstruction, weak, incompetent, unpopular, and ostentatiously hostile to both British and Russian interests. In August the Sardar-i-Zafar, a Bakhtiari Chief, was appointed Gover nor-General of Kerman and Baluchistan but never took up the appointment. On September 5th, however, his eldest son, Sarim-ul-Mulk, arrived in Kerman with an assistant, Mudabbir-ud-Dowleh, and a small force of Bakhtiaris, and the Consuls were officially informed that he was to be regarded as Acting Governor-General, pending the arrival of his father. Sarim-ul-Mulk, a young man of 24, apparently regarded the extortion of money from all on whom he could lay hands, as the whole art of government. He robbed the people of the province on his way to Kerman, he robbed them during his snort stay, and he robbed them on his way home. It is said that his spoil amounted to about 80,000 tomans, but this estimate is probably exclusive of clothes, food, household goods, horses, and mules, taken by him and his men. Un September 17th Nusrat-us-Sultan, the Deputy Governor, alleging that banm- ul-Mulk had threatened him with personal violence m attempting to extort money from him, took refuge in the British Consulate, a step wmcii, consider ing the attitude which he had consistently adopted towards the Consul, would have been most humiliating to a man of finer sensibilities^ Un ber 3rd he left Kerman secretly, by night, for Tehran, Meshed, femng to travel openly or by the direct route, lest he should be waylaid by the i?aknti- aris or by some of the numerous enemies whom he had made unng administration of affairs.32 ABMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF On October 7th Sarim-ul-Mulk, having been informed that his father had been dismissed from the post of Governor-General and that he himself had no longer any official status in Kerman, left for Yezd, plundering the villages on his way thither. Sardar-i-Nusrat, commander of the local forces, was placed temporarily in charge of the government, and held charge until the end of the year. He has a sense of responsibility and has not spared himself in executing the duties of his office, but owing to lack of resources has been able to effect but little. The province has thus been without a Governor-General for nearly the whole of the year, and its conditions may best be described as one of anarchy. Baluchistan, which has paid no revenue for over three years, is virtually in dependent, and no Persian official will accept the Governorship of the pro vince. Not only is the province disturbed, but the Khans from time to time raid the eastern districts of the Kerman province, plundering villages, slay ing men, carrying off women and children into slavery, and causing much misery, and there is no force capable of resisting, much less of punishing them. Recently the districts of Rudbar and Jiruft have shewn some symptoms of an inclination to follow the example of Baluchistan. Payment of the revenue has been withheld and, in October, Mehdi Kuli Khan, the Deputy Governor of JirufJt, was murdered by a gang of men headed by one Pahlvan Muhammad Khan of Jamalbariz. The murderers are still at large. On April 7th two Mujtabids of Kerman, Mirza Ismail and Mirza Mah- mud, brothers, were arrested by the police for preaching in inflammatory terms against the British. A telegram was received from Tehran ordering their deportation, but, owing to the protests of the Muj tabids of Najif and the townspeople of Kerman, the sentence was reversed on conditions that the two Mujtahids refrained in future from preaching openly against Europeans. The action of the police has had a very salutary effect on the Mullas of Kerman. During the month of April one Abbas Kuli Daragai raided the Afshar country in the Kerman province. After remaining there for about a month and plundering the country he was driven out by Gunj Ali Khan, the Afshar Chief, but he took his booty with him. Muhammad Khan, ex-Governor of Jiruft, who was on bail in Kerman, awaiting his trial &lt;for acts of oppression committed by him in Jiruft, was seized by Nusrat-us-Sultan and flogged and tortured without trial. On August 6th he took refuge in the British Consulate where he remained for more than a month. The necessity for extending protection to a man who had undoubtedly behaved, 'as Governor of a district, in a brutal and oppres sive manner, was unfortunate, but as he had been punished without trial and without reference to the judicial authorities he could not be refused admis sion. He left on receiving assurances from the local authorities. v . sitorg No traveller passed through the Ker man province during the year. The Postal Department in the province is well managed on the British Pogts system by the Provincial Postmaster, who has many difficulties to contend with. The contractor for carrying mails between Kerman and Yezd was unable to meet the requirements of the postal authorities, and the Postmaster now arranges departmentally for the carriage of the posts on that line. Posts have been most irregular for a long time past, but this is due to the insecurity of the roads and not to any mismanagement on the part of the Postmaster, T any posts, both outgoing and incoming, have been intercepted and destroyed jy robbers, and many more have been delayed owing to robbers. The Telegraph Department has worked well under great difficulties. The , Persian authorities are unable to pro- eegrap s. ^ safety of the line between Bam and Kuh-i-Malik-ShiaH and much wilful damage is done both by Balu- chis and by gangs of Afghans returning from the coast, who, having been dis appointed of the loads of arms which they expected to bring back with them,POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. oo do all the mischief they can, and not only damage the line but are a menace to the lives of the Telegraph officials. The guards provided by the Persian authorities are very irregularly paid and frequent dssertions are the natural consequence. The connection of Kerman with Bandar Abbas by a direct line of tele- graph is very desirable. It may almost be said that all roads in the province have been unsafe Roads. throughout the year. The Kerman-Ban- „ . „ , , . dar Abbas roads were infested by cara vans of Afghan traders m arms, until the end of March, and, during the re mainder oi the year, caravans have from time to time been plundered by rob bers from Fars. Robbers from the same province have also infested the Kerman-Yezd road throughout the year. This road was safe during May when the Sardar-i-Jang, Governor-Gene ral of Yezd, was taking active measure against the robbers, but at no other time, for it was liable to raids at all times. For about the last two months of the year the road was closed to (traffic by a large gang of Farsi robbers, who established themselves at Shims and robbed both travellers and villagers. M. Petroff, the Acting Russian Consul, who left Kerman on November 7th, was robbed before he had travelled three stages, and by the end of the year had not travelled beyond Anar, six stages from Kerman. All roads in Baluchistan are unsafe, but the activities of the Baluch Sardars have by no means been confined to their own province. They have robbed caravans on the roads between Kerman and Bam and Bam and Kashit and Khabis, and have from time to time infested the roads between Bam and the Baluchistan border. One incident deserves special mention as an instance of the unwilling ness of the Persian officials to cope with robbers even under the most favour able conditions. On November 7th, four Afghans, representing themselves to be peaceful travellers, joined a caravan of Khorasanis travelling from Bam to Yezd, and near Bam attacked their fellow travellers killing four and wounding a fifth, and drove off 35 camels. Nasir-ul-Mamalik of Bam, who enjoys a reputation for courage and determination, went in pursuit of the robbers with about fifty mounted men, not twenty, as reported at the time. The Afghans were surrounded and showed fight, whereupon Nasir-ul- Mamalik withdrew his men, on the plea that they were hungry and must get food, and the Afghans marched off unmolested, driving the camels with them. It would be difficult to imagine a more disgraceful display of cowardice. Owing to the insecurity of the roads freights between Kerman and Bandar Abbas have risen from krans 180 to krans 400 a kharwar, and the prices of imported goods, among which may be mentioned tea and sugar, have risen proportionately in Kerman. The Kerman branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia was open throughout the year under the management of Mr. Bank - F. G. T. Nelson, Mr. L. Newman holding the post of accountant.

Snow fell early in December, which is unusual and, on December 16th, the minimum temperature recorded was 11°. Many large caravans of Afghans travelled through Persian Baluchistan on their way to and from the coast. The Arms traffic. damage done by these Afghans to the telegraph line has already been mentioned. The Consul at Bandar Abbas was regularly informed of .the movements of caravans. Cholera broke out in Meshed in the middle of the year, and pilgrims . . returning thence brought the disease to p 1 emic lsease - Rawar., A quarantine station was es tablished there, but the disease made its appearance in Kerman, on November 21st. Fortunately it was of a very mild type and the severity of the weather checked its dissemination. The local authorities took primitive measures t;o prevent the spread of the disease and valuable services were rendered by Drs. Dodson and Westlake of the Church Missionary Society and by Assist ant Surgeon Salt. The disease disappeared towards the end of December, by which time 105 cases and 50 deaths had occurred. The outbreak caused a fairly general exodus from Kerman, but the people returned to the town at the end of December. ' T. W.

Mir Barkat's subjects felt convinced that the Darya Begi would let Barkat return from Bandar Abbas, but when they realised that he was really a prisoner in Bushire, they decided that their only chance of helping Barkat was'to get the country iiito such a lawless state that Government would permit Barkat to return to restore order. With this in view, Dadulla, Seyyid Abdul Rahim, Ahdulla Dervish, and several others of Barkat's followers induced Mir Mustapha to leave Old Jask, on 15th May, and to throw in his lot with them. T^ey intended existing by raiding and told Mir Mustapha that if he did not join them, Mir Barkat would certainly be revenged on his return. The day after Mustapha left Old Jask, the Jask detachment of the 117th Mahrattas marched through the place, and by thus showing that we intended protecting it, they prevented any raiding in the immediate vicinity. Jemadar Dilmorad succeeded in bringing Mir Mustapha into Jask, on 17th June, when he express ed sorrow for what he had done. Mir Mustapha seemed to recognise that he had been ili-adyised by DadullV and he was asked to bring him in. He expressed his willingness, but it soon became apparent that he was reluctant to do so. Ilisson Cherag was therefore kept in the compound at Jask and Mir Mus tapha was told that his son would not be given his liberty till Dadulla was pro duced; this had the desired effect, and Dadulla was brought in by Mir Mus tapha on 7th July. Dadulla was sent down to India as a prisoner, but, on August the 25th, T heard quite by chance that he was at large in Karachi, and intended returning to Jask by the mail which was about to leave. This in formation was wired tp the Political Agent, Mask at, who was fortunately able to arrange that he should not land at Jask but go on to Lingah. Mir Barkat escaped from Bushire at the end of August during the absence of the Darya Begi in Tangistan. He travelled overland and was accompanied by one of his slaves; they reached Kuhistak at the end of September and went to his home at Jagdan in Bashkard, Soon after Barkat's return, Seyyid Abdulla with 15 of.I^arkat's men rushed Mir Kamber's house at Tajak at dawn one morning, severely wounding Mir Kamber and killing four of his slaves. During September Barkat's adherent^ formed two parties, one under Abdulla Dervish and Seyyid Abd\illa, and the other under Yar Muhammad, Muham mad Abd^Nabbi, and Noor Muhammad. The former threatened old Jask but owing to s6m6 support being given to Mir Mustapha and the inhabitants of old Jask, they contented themselves with looting 100 goats, 4 camels, 20 cows, 2 donkeys and the contents of two huts between Zaraki and Soorkoh. The latter party were reported by Mir Haji to have looted 1,000 maunds of wheat, 500 bustas of dates, 100 goats and to have burnt twenty huts near Sarzhai. MJr Barkat seems to have come down to Biyaban with a large following, but at this distance I have been unable to gather information which is sufficiently accurate to record, regarding Barkat's doings and the attempt to catch him at Sarzeh at the end of December. The situation in Biyaban cannot be said to be satisfactpry and there is little hope of its being improved until Mir Barkat is either recognised or removed. On the 4th April 200 Bashkardies attacked about 650 Afghans at Sarzeh, the latter had t\vo wounded whilst the former lost twelve killed and two cap tured, these two were afterwards killed and burnt. F 236 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Sardar Seyyid Khan and Islam Khan have, during the autumn, come to a Gaih District. 1 better understanding. Seyyid Khan 0 . 1 , has practically given the district between feadaich and Tank and as far northward as Bint to Islam Khan. He also sent Islam to Bampur on his behalf to collect the taxes, at the end of November. Islam Khan has hitherto undoubtedly been interested in the arms traffic, but he came down to Rapch to see me in November and signed an agreement by which he undertakes to do all in his power to assist us in stopping it. He probably sees that our efforts to stop the trade have greatly decreased the chances of making a profit in that direction, and therefore thinks it better business to assist us, and thus obtain the good opinion of Government, and probably a subsidy. I met Sardar Seyyid Khan in Charbar at the end of December; he seems the most genuine and well disposed Chief that I have met, but it is a great pity that he is so addicted to opium smoking. The impression left on one's mind after seeing both Seyyid Khan and Islam Khan is that the latter is a capable energetic man who is ambitious, and who will no doubt one day be the paramount chief of Gaih, and that the former is a well meaning chief who has had most of his energy sapped by the use of opium, and who is, therefore, liable to be dominated by the more powerful personality of Islam Khan. It may be that Seyyid Khan himself feels this, and if so, it would ac count for the ill-feeling which has existed between them. An Afghan travelling from Bint to Karwan was murdered just outside Hiyan, about 27th October. Dost Muhammad bin Shiigrell of Hiyan is reported to have incited Hakimdad bin Shabek and Shahgul bin Yar Muham mad to the act. The object was robbery, and the culprits are said to have stolen a camel, a thousand rupees in cash, and ten Indian currency notes of unknown values. Early in November two Afghans quarrelled in the Masjid in Bint; during the heat of the quarrel one drew his sword and murdered the other. Islam Khan is reported to have kept the murdered man's horse and other belongings. The telegraph line was wrecked at Gilik, 5 miles east of the Sadaich river, on 26th May, by Afghans whose consignment of arms had been captured off Habt by H. M. S. ' Perseus.' Both wires were again cut at Supt, 32 miles from Charbar, on 7th September, by four Dizakis in revenge for having been obliged to jettison the arms they were bringing from Maskat, owing to the approach of one of His Majesty's Ships. The strained relationship between Mir Mahmud Khan and Mir Din Dashtyari District. Muhammad continues to exist. Mir . Dm Muhammad made a pilgrimage to Baghdad in September and October, returning to Charbar in November via Maskat and Karachi. When he reached his home at Mirai bazaar he heard that Mahmud Khan's son, Mir Doorr, had been gathering taxes and fining his subjects close to his fort at Mirai bazaar; he retaliated by treating some of Mahmud^ Khan's subjects in like manner. They then quarrelled regarding the division of the revenue which had been collected during Din Muhammad's absence. About 26th December Din Muhammad sent two brothers (Gundows) from Mirai bazaar to Boonau to murder Mahmud Khan, but the latter was warned by one of his followers and set out with six men lo search for them. They came on the men hidden by the roadside when one fired on Mahmud Khan, the bullet grazing his side. One was shot by Mahmud Khan on the spot and the other caught alive by his followers; this second man, after confessing that Mir Din Muhammad had hired them for Rs. 500 to murder Mahmud Khan, was shot in the latter's fort at Boonau. The followers of Din Muham mad declare that there was no intention to murder Mahmud Khan, but that the men were looking for lost cattle, and that the idea of murder was solely a creation of Mahmud Khan's fear. Din Muhammad now claims blood money, which Mahmud Khan refuses to pay on the ground that the men were mur derers. The general opinion is that the men intended murdering Mahmud Khan. Nawab Khan of Bhao Kalat has attached himself to Din Muhammad, he ^eems a most truculent young man whose ill-advice is probably responsible for half The trouble in Dashtyari.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOE 1910. 37 Slaves.

M. S. ' Redbreast the Shaikh's band playing ' God Save the King ' as he left the shore. This was the first occasion on which the revised salutes allotted to the Shaikh and to his son were fired. j News of the investiture of the Shaikh with a British decoration appears to havp been telegraphed to the ' Times ' from a correspondent at Basrah, on October 15th, and attracted no unfavourable not^ce^ but at Baghdad and Bas rah a considerable display of ill-informed and malevolent criticism resulted, and the Ilabl-ul-Matin endeavoured to connect the action of His Majesty's Government in the matter with the note addressed to the Persian Government by His Majesty's Government in connection with the safety of the Bushire- Ispahan road. The Shaikh's relations with the Persian Government, remained correct, (and caused no anxiety throughout the Relations of the Shaikh with the Persian year, although the apprehension that the Govemmen Bakh.tiari might succeed in themselves dominating that Government, referred to below, was a source of much trouble, and very nearly resulted in hostilities breaking out between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiari. The action of the Persian Government in refusing to recog nize his agreement with the Oil Company, and in ordering him to repudiate it, proved entirely abortive as might; be. expected. : &gt; Difficulties between the Shaikh and the Wali of Basrah, Suleiman Nathif ' ! Bey, resulting in the bombardment of Relations of the Shaikh with the Turks. Zain by the Turkish gunboat ' Marma- ris,' engaged the attention of Sis Majes ty's Government during the summer. The incident arose out of th^ demand by the Wali of Basrah for the surrender hy the Shaikh of Muhammad-al- Kanan, his brother-in-law, a tribal chief owning allegiance to him, and residing at Zajn in Turkish territory, but claiming to be a Persian subject. The Wali accused Muhammad-alrKanan of various offences, the principal being an alleged threat to murder Muhammad Mn Mshri, a Turkish land owner who r had a dispute with his cultivators, who had Muhammad-al-Kanan s support. On the Shaikh refusing to. surrender Muhammad-al-Kanan, the Wali issued orders for the bombardment and burning of his village and hpuse, which were in occupation, of tribesmen owning al|egia^ to the Shaikh, it uncertain how far the Wali was acting under orders from the Turkish Government in doing so. On the matter being reported to Government, His Majesty s Consuls at IBasrah and Mohammerah were instructed touring about-a settlement between the two parties, and through the mediation of Haji Rais, the local question was temporarily settled by an exchange of notes between the S ai a Wali. J. ■ ■■ 4 After an examination of the papers in tailed notice here, His Majesty's Government held the action of the Turk sh Government to have been arbitrary and violent, and commended the attitude of moderation and restraint adopted by the Shaikh on our advice. The Turkish view of the matter may be inferred from the Council of State at Constantinople decreed, m Angus , _ Mi rz a should be registered in the names of the Shaikh, or J 11 ® re P . .. ' j Hamzah, or the latter's servant, Mulla Mustafa. that they were prepared to reconsider this decision, but unfavourable rightly in His Majesty's Consul's opinion, that the moment was u for him to take tbe initiative in raising the question, and p g made towards a solution of this during the year. 'An awkward incident occurred, in October 1910, when Fadaghia on the Turkish side of the Shatt-ehArab owned ^the Mishn family, whose dispute was the primary cause of the Zam affair, were looted Dy40 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF a gang of Arabs, of whom some were undoubtedly Persian subjects of the Shaikh. The Wali claimed a large quantity of dates and a heavy cash compen sation from the Shaikh, in satisfaction of the losses alleged to have been in flicted on the Mishri family by the Shaikh's tribes. The matter was also re ferred to Tehran by the Turks, and the Shaikh received a communication from Tehran containing the usual vague exhortations to do all that was right and proper in the matter. The Porte declined to sanction a proposal of the Wali previously negatived by his Council at Basrah, to bombard Mohammerah and Fallahiyah forthwith. The fact that the Council were seriously asked to sanction such a step shows to what lengths the modern Young Turk will go, and how completely devoid he is at present of any sense of proportion or restraint. The Shaikh's troubles, actual and potential, with the Bakhtiari, reached an acute stage in April, when it was Relations of the Shaikh with the Bakhtiari. generally believed that his Old enemy, the Sardar Assad, then Minister of In terior, was manoeuvring to establish himself with the assistance of his tribes men and relations in a position of permanent predominance. After much vacillating, due to his unwillingness to do anything of which the British Gov- ernment might disapprove, the Shaikh signed an agreement in company with the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, Ilkhani of the Kashgai, and the Sardar Ashraf Wali of Pushlfc-i-Ruh, nominally to promote constitutionalism and peace, and the S l e S o* roa( ls within their respective dominions, to assist and strengthen the Medjliss, and to support each other in case of attack. The last two conditions were plainly intended as a hint for the benefit of the Bakhtiari. The agreement remained, as it was probably intended to be, a dead letter throughout the year, but it served a useful purpose in reminding the Sardar Assad of the probable effect of the policy which he was believed to contemplate. The Shaikh s apprehensions were to some extent relieved by an assurance from His Majesty's Minister, in April, that our understandings with regard to encroachments on his rights, etc., by the Persian Government applied equally to the Sardar Assad as long as he was Minister of Interior. Shortly after this the Sardar Assad ceased to be Minister of Interior though he still remained in the Cabinet as Minister of War, but the question did not again assume an acute phase till September, when Bakhtiari designs on the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh caused the latter to appeal to the Shaikh to make good his promises. The Shaikh replied with vague assurances, and the ques tion was eventually relieved by the espousal of the Sowlet's cause by the Amir-i-Muffakham s party with whom the Shaikh had made an informal compact for mutual assistance in May. The Shaikh was therefore not called on to make good his promises of assistance to the Sowlet. A few weeks later however hostilities threatened between the rival fami lies of the Khans, and Amir-i-Muffakham appealed to the Shaikh to assist mm by bringing pressure to bear from the south on the lands of his opponents. The Shaikh again responded by vague assurances which he was luckily not called on to make good, as, thanks no doubt in some measure to the possibility of his intervention, the opposing parties came to terms, and a peace was patched up. ou -i 1 ? 6 P ractic . al valu€ 0 . f tlie compact between the Amir Muffakham and the Shaikh was again shown in December in the following way. Throughout the year, A. Rahim had continued his policy of the previous winter, and left no stone unturned to seduce Farhan Assad from his allegiance to the Shaikh and m so doing there is no doubt that he was acting under the direct orders of the ^ardar Zanar. The Shaikh, who had earlier in the year experienced trouble with Farhan, was finally compelled to send a punitive expedition against the latter to exact punishment for various aggressive acts, and to obtain the revenue tor the previous few years, which was in arrears. Farhan, the bulkPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910 ' 41 of whose tribes lost no time in deserting him, took refuge after a brief skir mish with A. Rahim. The latter had intended to send him assistance, but the Amir Muhakham s adherents, with the approval of their chief made it clear to him that if be supported larhan aouvely they on their part would render a similar service to the Shaikh. Farhan finally took refuge with the Bakhtian, with whom he still was at the clos(j of the year A request on the part of His Majesty's Minister to the Sardar that he should use his in fluence to prevent A. Kahim from supporting Farhan or from protecting him in any way was met by the assertion that the Shaikh had no right to roerce him; he refused altogether to hand him over to the Shaikh. The Shaikh who throughout the affair kept the Governor of Arabistan and the Minister of Interior fully apprised of his intentions and objects, threatened to pursue to Ab-bid unless his subject, Haidar of the A1 Kathir, was released from Ab-bid, whence he had been taken as a prisoner by Farhan; the threat was successtul, and Haidar was set free without delay. At the close of the year no settlement between the Shaikh and Farhan had been effected, and a renewal of hostilities seemed not unlikely. M. Zwinne was Provincial Director till October, when he went on six Customs Administration. months' leave, being replaced by M. Delcroix from Kermanshah. Both were on the whole pleasant and helpful in their attitude to the Consulate, though M. Zwinne was much disliked by the Oil Company, who had however only themselves to thank for any severity he may have shown to them. M. Del croix evinced at first a disposition to interfere in quarantine matters, and to make new and irksome rules and regulations, but the phase was transient, and he soon settled down to steady work in his legitimate sphere. The relations of the Customs with the Shaikh were on the whole good but the unwonted activity of the Steam Launch ' Muzaffari' in the autumn' the dismissal of Shaikh Abdul Hussein, Director at Nasiri, and the proposal of the Central Administration to place a Belgian in the latter place, in violation of the Firman, which stipulated that only one Belgian should be employed in Arabistan, caused the Shaikh some anxiety, and negotiations were proceeding at the close of the year, with the assistance of His Majesty's Minister, to en sure that the Shaikh's firman should not lose any of its force by reason of the new appointment proposed. Smuggling continued unabated throughout the year. No cases of plague occurred througnout the year. Assistant Surgeon G. B. Rehling, I.S.M.D., held charge throughout the Quarantine, l™ 1 ' exce ^ fDr three months during the autumn, when he was temporarily re placed by Assistant Surgeon Lincoln from Bandar Abbas. Cholera broke out in Baghdad, in September, and found its way thence to joasrah, Mohammerah, Fallahiyah and Ahwaz. Numerous deaths occurred in Mohammerah, Fallahiyah and also in the Shaikh's army which was collected at the time near Ahwaz. Quarantine was imposed at Ahwaz on arrivals from Mohammerah, and strict medical inspection of ballams arriving at Mohammerah from Basrah was also arranged for. No friction occurred, but the Sanitary Council of Health provided for some 700 tomans expenditure through the agency of the shaikh's Physician, Assistant Surgeon Francis (retired) on disinfectants, etc., or use in the town of Mohammerah, a singularly futile waste of money. Fast and slow mails called weekly Marine ' and fortnightly respectively throughout the year. The local postal service was very satisfactorily carried on. At the Close p ogts of the year a weekly service between Ahwaz and Ispahan was started, but it emains to be seen whether it will be satisfactory. It is much needed, as the post via Bushire takes six weeks to Tehran and that via Kermanshah nearly a month from Mohammerah. g42 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The British Indian Post Office worked satisfactorily throughout the year; tne establishment of the Bank made little difference to the volume of Money Order traffic. An arrangement was come to whereby the Bank took over the Post Office surplus cash, and credited the Treasury at Bushire with an equi valent sum. A daily passenger and private postal service was carried on for the first time, in December, between Basrah and Mohammerah, and was most conveni ent. Three cases of piracy were reported to His Majesty's Representatives at piracieg Bushire or at Mohammerah as having occurred in or near the Shatt-el-Arab, or by residents of the banks of that river. The first case took place about 14th February the victim being a Bushire mashwa : the pirates were Arabs. No lives were lost, but about Rs. 800 worth of goods were stolen. Nothing has been recovered. The second case took place on the 7th March, on the bar. The pirated boat was owned by an inhabitant of Bandar Rig. The pirates were Arabs from Ma'amar and Dorah led by some exiled Shaikhs of Qasbat-al-Nassar, domiciled since 1904 at Kuwait. No lives were lost, but Rs. 10,000 in cash and goods stolen. Nothing has been recovered, and though the Shaikh of Kuwait sent some of the Shaikhs implicated to Shaikh Khazal, they were later on released. The third case was perpetrated on a Kuwait boat, and is no doubt dealt with in the report of that agency. The pirates were Arabs resident in Turk ish territory, but subjects of Shaikh Khazal. Their Turkish domicle made it impossible for the Shaikh to arrest them, and nothing was done in that direction up to the end of the year. The Shushtar-Dizful road was frequently unsafe, and the environs of ^ . x . Dizful were at no time of the year free Communications. r, ^ i i j - p xu ri i from the depredations of the Sagwand. Those parts of Arabistan under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh remained at peace throughout the year, and no case of robberies from British subjects were reported. The robberies which occurred in the Kharran lands are reported on separately. The Persian steamer ' Nusrat ' ran Karun Navigation.-Lower River. throughout the year as also did the Malamir and the Tug Bulbul.' A mass of pipes fell into the river during the spring rises, the bank on which they were piled having been cut away by the water. They constituted later on a grave danger to navigation, and Messrs. Lynch Brothers eventually arranged to salve them for the Oil Company. This was still being done at the close of the year. The Persian steamer ' Shushan ' (Lynch Brothers) and the Persian Karun NavigaW -Upper River. steamer ' M'awiu ' (the Nasiri Com pany) continued to run throughout the year. The question of the Shalili shed was not raised during the year, and Messrs. Lynch enjoyed undisputed use of it. The question of the ownership of the Darreh Khazineh lands was not raised during the year as far as the Oil Company's landing place was con cerned. The Oil Company found it necessary to supplement the carrying capacity of the Shushan ' and ' M'awin ' by an oil launch towing two barges. The oil launch was sent over the rapids, on April 23rd, after permission had been ob tained from the Persian Government, not without great difficulty, and only for a period of one year. His Majesty's Legation however informed the Persian Government that they would expect permission to be renewed at the end of the year, and it is not likely that serious difficulty will arise on this score. The importation of three barges for use with this launch was objected to vehemently by the Persian Government, and it was not found possible to obtain the permission for their use. His Majesty's Minister therefore authorized1910 POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 43 them to be put on the Upper Karun without waiting for formal sanction, and this was done in July, with the co-operation of the fehaikh, and in spite of the opposition of the Karguzar. The launch and barges are employed solely on the Oil Company's work, and the Persian steamer ' Shushan ' and ' M'awin ' are likewise being utilised as far as is possible without interfering with the Sh^shtar and Dizful cargo. Early in the year Messrs. Lynch proposed to replace the ' Shushan ' tem porarily by the ' Ishtar,' whilst the former was undergoing repair. His Majesty's Minister sanctioned this being done without formally informing the Persian Government, the Karguzar at Mohammerah being notified when it had actually been done. It was stipulated, however, that the ' Ishtar '^should re turn to the Lower Karun as soon as the Persian steamer ' Shushan ' returned. The project did not however mature. It may be of interest to recall here that in 1892, when a similar proposal was made by Messrs. Lynch Brothers, the Persian Government refused to give the desired permission, and the matter was not pressed by His Majesty's Minister. The result was that the Nasiri Company's boat monopolized the traffic on the Upper Karun, and raised rates all round, to the general dissatisfaction of British and foreign merchants. This branch did, it is understood, a good business during the first year of its existence, and fulfilled a real need Imperial Bank of Persia, Mohammerah. ^ the Commercial Community. In October it was decided to open a branch at Ahwaz, and Mr. Dewar Diirie, in charge of the Mohammerah branch, proceeded to Ahwaz at the be ginning of 1911 to take charge of the new branch. Mr. Dalton arrived from Shiraz to take charge in his place at Mohammerah. The Aliwaz branch is opened, it is understood, in the confident expectation of handling the Customs receipt apart from which there is not much business to be done at Ahwaz.

It does not include Government servants or Quarantine staff. The vexed question of the status of Bahrainis in Mohammerah was satis- Bahrainis factorily settled for the time being at all ' events by an agreement with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, come to informally between His Excellency and His Majes ty's Consul, whereby Bahrainis who had settled in Mohammerah previous to his accession are treated as his subjects, those who have arrived after being treated as British subjects. This arrangement is conditional on the Shaikh treating all Bahrainis alike with justice and consideration. As the aggre gate total of Bahrainis in Arabistan is probably not less than 1,000, it is necessary to be circumspect in dealing with the question of their title to pro tection, particularly as many of them have had their names inscribed with their own consent in the tribal books, and thereby tacitly acknowledged themselves as subjects of the Shaikh. Lance Naik Surveyor Muhammad Zaman Khan, 34th Poona Horse, made Surveys several surveys during the year, some of them with the assistance of Civil Sur veyor Ali Ahmad, Survey of India. The work of both was excellent. The Shatait river and Mianab district were surveyed by the former in the spring. Later on a combined survey on the 1 m. = 1 inch scale was carried out of the Fallahiyah district, including part of the Jarrahi river, and the Khor Buzi. A detailed survey was made of the environs of the Mohammerah Consulate and Customs. The issue of a warrant by His Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, on His Judicial. Majesty's Consul, Basrah, for the arrest of 23 British Indians who had assaulted the staff of the Oil Company's Managing Agents, Messrs. Lloyd Scott &amp; Co., Ltd., revealed a serious flaw in the continuity of Consular jurisdiction at the head of the Gulf. On His Majesty s Consul, Basrah, asking the Wali to assist him in arrest ing the said men, the Wali replied that, as there was no extradition treaty be tween Great Britain and Turkey, he could not hand over the men. He was supported in this attitude by the Porte, and the representations of His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople were of no avail. Any person sub ject to Consular jurisdiction, therefore, accused of having committed a crime in Turkey or Persia, can escape arrest by taking refuge across the frontier. This is particularly inconvenient in the case of Mohammerah, which is a frontier town, and whilst there are likely to be several hundred British Indians permanently at work at Braim on Abadan, any one of whom can escape punishment by crossing the river. No progress in this direction was made during the year, though the Irrigation Schemes in Arabistan. :Du1 ; 0h Minister in Tehran is Still aSsSu- ously attempting to push a Dutch Karun Irrigation Scheme, so far however with no success. In January 1909, information was obtained by His Majesty's Minister that the Nizam-us-Sultaneh had granted a concession for irrigation in Arabis tan to a Russian subject. It subsequently transpired that the Hussamabad lands near Shush were the subject of the concession, which had been granted to one Abbas Agha Taraverdieff. The terms of the lease, which was for 25 years, were onerous and, up to the end of the year the concessionaire had taken no steps to enter into posses sion of his estates. The ground is very fertile and well suited for develop ment but it is far inland, and in the possession of Arab tribes who settledPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOB 1910. ^ there, it is stated many years ago, by express invitation of one of the Shahs of Persia, and look on the leased area as theirs by right. They are not likely to submit to eviction or rackrenting by the lease holder. In October 1910, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf suggested to the Shaikh the advisability of taking active steps to commence some minor irrigation scheme in his territories so as to forestall outside enterprise, and he was reminded of the practicability and lucrativeness of the Karkha Irri gation Scheme to which Sir W. Willcocks had given testimony at the beginning of the year, it being clear that he could take no forward steps until he knew what attitude he might expect the Nizam-us-Sultaneh to adopt towards the scheme, he having certain rights, it is understood, in the Karkha lands, it was agreed that he should take an early opportunity to sound the Nizam-us- Sultaneh to see if he was inclined to set much store on his alleged rights in the country in question, and whether he would be disposed to join with him (Shaikh). Steady progress was made by this Company in laying down pipes from , „ . ^ ^ the oil wells at Masiid-i-Suleiman to Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. ,1 n . -r&gt; • a-uj tij the rennery at Braim on Abadan Island, and in erecting the necessary buildings and plant at the latter place. A large staff of Europeans and Indians was brought into the country, and though a few were invalided, the health of the Company's employes was gen erally excellent. The relations of the Company's Managing Agents with the Shaikh and with other local authorities left something to be desired at times, and a mis taken idea of the functions and duties of Managing Agents, and an inflated notion of their own importance was responsible for a good deal of friction be tween the agents and the superior local staff of the Company. Orders were issued at the close of the year by the Directors regarding the duties of the Managing Agents restricting their power considerably, and it is hoped that there will be less in the future of the friction which has undoubtedly been pre judicial to the Company's progress during the year. The principal features of the Company's work during the year were as follows:— Braim. —Progress made with refinery, surrounded by four miles of ex panded metal fencing 10 feet high. A 4 feet 6 inches railway runs round the work. Steel jetties are being erected. Southern Arabistan.—Woik commenced on the pipe line. Loss of 750 pipes at Kut 'Abdullah on the Karun, the river having eaten away the bank where the pipes were stacked : Messrs. Lynch Brothers were engaged m salv ing these pipes at the close of the year. The crossing of the Bahmanshir by the pipe line was delayed by the foundering of the Kurdistan in which the gear necessary for the purpose was sent out from England. 4 Extension of Moin's tramway to the Company's site on the Karun above Ahwaz completed. Explosive shed erected. Northern /I'ra&amp;isto.—Progress was made at yarious points with the pipe line. Telephone line erected. Oil launch and three barges placed on Upper Karun.

REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. The Ahwaz-Ispahan road was much patronized by muleteers in spite of exorbitant charges for fodder, and a certain amount of robbing and pilfering from which it was free in the previous year. The good wheat harvest, whilst it stimulated general trade, had little effect on British firms, except those interested in shipping, whether on the Karun or to England. The price of wheat ruled low at home, and Messrs. Lynch Brothers found it necessary to sell a large quantity of wheat, for which they had made advances, to Messrs. R. W. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., who shipped it to Germany by the Hamburg Amerika boats doubtless at special rates. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. found themselves quite unable to deal in wheat at a profit, and Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co., Ltd., did little in that line, restricting their purchases to a few hundred tons. It is stated that the Germans found themselves unable to dispose of the wheat which they had bought and shipped to Germany. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. sent an European representative to represent the firm temporarily in Mohammerah for the first time. It is to be regretted that circumstances made it impossible to make the arrangement a permanent one. The activities of the Imperial Bank of Persia have already been referred to. Messrs. Lynch Brothers exhibited no signs of bestirring themselves during the year, though their reported intention of appointing an European to repre sent the firm in Ispahan may indicate that they are at last awake to the desir ability of a step which should have been taken at least two years ago. It is understood that, after the end of this year, they will no longer represent Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co. at Mohammerah, though if the agency is given, as is suggested, to Lloyd Scott &amp; Co., Ltd., who have not the benefit of experi ence of local conditions, the change is not likely to be beneficial to Messrs. Strick. Messrs. R. W. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. continued their operations on much the same lines as last year; they seem to do very little business, and what little they do is not of a remunerative kind, though it should be added that they have been very chary of giving credit lately. Messrs. P. ter Meulen &amp; Co., the Holland-Persia Trading Com pany, continued to do business in Nasiri on a small scale and to act as for warding agents to the Tobacco Regie at Ispahan. A. T.

The reason which he gave for this repudiation of responsibility was that certain of the Bakhtiari Khans of the Ilkhani family, namely, Haji Khushro Khan, Sardar-us-Zaffar, and Yussuf Khan Amir-i- Mujahid, were stirring up trouble in the Bakhtiari country, and that the latter of these two Chiefs had treacherously captured and imprisoned, in Chigakhor fort, Ghulam Ali Khan, who is a nephew of Sultan Muhammad Khan and belongs to the Haji Ilkhani branch. This move of the Sardar Ashraf of closing the road was dictated by the desire to force British intervention in favour of his kinsman; but it came to nought, as His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, wrote holding the Bakhtiari Chiefs to their responsibility and, shortly afterwards, to prove the effect of this move, he (His Majesty's Consul) requested the Sardar Ashraf to supply him with as many guards as he might consider necessary to accompany him on tour to Arabistan. Guards were supplied and the closure of the road averted. Early in the year serious trouble was caused on the road by the then Act ing Ilkhani and Acting Ilbegi delaying certain specie forwardments, which were en route from Ahwaz to Ispahan. Four large robberies have occurred on the Lynch road during the year under review. In the early part of the robteriel n tler:or gements on road and ^ the guarding of the dangerous portions of the road was entrusted byscife agrail'iV VL'Sr* POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. f 49 me Bakhtiari Khans to Hussein Khan and Ali Murad Khan, the former of the Mohmadi, the latter of the Ahmedi branches of the Bahama! Kuhgelus, as a guarantee of whose good behaviour the Bakhtiari Chiefs retained host ages given by the Kuhgelu, notably among whom was the son of Ali Murad Khan, who was in the charge of Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakham. This arrangement worked satisfactorily till the month (of September, thereby proving the correctness of His Majesty's Consul's recommendation as to the advantageousness of the Bakhtiari Chiefs taking over the Governorship of the Kuhgelus. Subsequent on dissensions breaking out among the Bakhtiari Chiefs, the hostages were released and the Kuhgelu commenced their depredations. The first of the robberies took place at a place called the Chati Murwarid. The caravan belonged to Urujin Traders, Persian subjects, the aggressors in this case being Muzarmi Bakhtiaris assisted by Dushman Ziari Kuhgelus, the latter carrying off 21 mules, the former the loads. The second robbery was perpetrated by the above tribes, who carried off 39 mules, carrying property belonging to Deh Kurd and Cham Asmani Trad ers (Persian subjects). The third and fourth robberies were of property carried by Messrs. Lynch Brothers for Persian merchants. The first consisted of 131 lbs. opium, valued at 5,240 krans, the other three sheets of copper valued at 811 krans. In August, a ruling was issued by His Majesty's Legation, Tehran, that in cases where the persons suffering loss were other than British subjects, Consular intervention was to be confined to assistance of a purely unofficial character. The material condition of the road is fair. The advice constantly given ^ „,, T , ^ ' by His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, to the on ition o e ync oa . Bakhtiari Chiefs with regard to cara vanserais at last commenced to bear fruit in the spring, when Haji Ali Kulli Khan, Sardar Assad, commenced the building of a caravanserai at the Godar Bridge, and the repair of the Shalil and Sarkhum caravanserais was taken in hand by other of the Bakhtiari Khans. A new system of bridge tolls was inaugurated by the Bakhtiari Khans in the spring, on a system of paper Bndge tolls on the Lynch Road. checks, taken at the first bridge passed over and delivered up at the last. Up to the end of September 46,000 tomans had been taken, and on the same ratio, allowing for winter cessation of traffic, it is estimated that not less than 60,000 tomans will have been taken. This sum being an estimated increase of 12,000 tomans over the actual takings of the preceding year, which were actually in round numbers 48,000 tomans, being an increase of 8,000 tomans over the sum estimated in the Administra tion Report of 1909 as the probable takings for that year. A new system was also inaugurated with regard to the leasing of cara vanserais. Instead of the old system of Leases of Caravanserais on the Lynch Road. ^ lease for the year to th6 highest bidder, the caravanserais were handed over to certain persons, who had to pay rent for same at the rate of J kran per mule or camel shown by the bridge check-tickets as having passed over the road. Fodder and provisions on the Bakhtiari road, more especially between Malamir and Dopalun, were excessively dear during the period under review. Tours of His Britannic Majesty's Consul, (spring tour.) Owing to circumstances, which will be explained hereafter under the heading ' British Interests—Anglo-Per sian Oil Company,' His Majesty's Con sul proceeded on tour accompanied by Mr. G. B. Lloyd of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on the 27th March, and proceeded vid Wais and Reghewa to Kima, near Earn Hormuz, which was In Northern and Southern Arabistan and the Bakhtiari country.50 administration report of the persian gulf reached on the 30th March. After spending 11 days negotiating at Kima His Majesty's Consul proceeded to the Masjid Suleiman Oil Field, and thence via Batwand to Shushtar and Dizful in Northern Arabistan returninp- to Ahwaz on the 1st May. ' 5 (summer tour.) Owing to the reported lease of land in Northern Arabistan to a Russian Ahwaz to istsahan. Subject, which is dealt with infra under r T . (. t t -&gt; • „ r e headm g ' Foreign Interests—Lease of land for Irrigation to Russians/' it was decided to proceed to Ispahan via the Arab country on the west of the Karun, hitherto unvisited by His Maies- y sl^^esentative in Ahwaz. A great deal of new ground was also explored m the Bakhtian country. A start was made on the 21st May, proceeding via Beit Yarullah Abu (arimyen, Gunyeh, and across the Shwabeh lands to Sardarabad. Thence rid J alakan and Gotwand across the Aquli plain to Eahdarnn. and thence the Murda Fil Pass and Aola to Malamir. From Malamir a detour was made to Susan and Papil, whence it was intended to reach the Upper Dinarun country via the Faleh. Owing, how ever, to unforeseen circumstances this route was impossible, and the Upper Dinarun country had to be reached by another route via Dilli, Deh Diz and ^Teng-i-Memun. The Upper Dinarun country was then traversed right ou- i ' s ^ ua ^ head of the Faleh. Thence via Ghurrab and bhmdun to the Kaj valley, and thence via the Hara Khar Pass into Mezdij, which was crossed and Deh Kurd reached ma the Teng-i-Sarish- jun. From Deh Kurd the Kaf-i-Rukh Pass was made via the Dotu. Thence down the valley of the Zainda Rud, over the Gavpisa Pass into the Ispahan plain. His Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan, met His Majesty's Consul at the foot of the Gavpisa Pass, whence they proceeded together to Ispahan via Bagh Wahush and Pul-i-Wargun, arriving at Ispahan on the 24th June. (autumn tour.) Owing to His Britannic Majesty's Consul's projected return to India, in Ispahan to Ahwaz. October, it was proposed to leave Ispa- . . ban early in September, but subsequent on dissensions breaking out among the Bakhtiari Chiefs, a start was not made trom Ispahan till the 14th September. A detour was made via the Lingunat, hitherto unvisited by His Majesty's Representative at Ahwaz to Kaf-i-Rukh, thence the various Bakhtiari Chiefs of both families were visited at their several residences. From the Chahar Mahal, His Majesty's Consul proceeded via Ardal, Qala Tul and Reghewa to Ahwaz, which was reached on the 22nd October, making a total mileage of 1,215 miles, covered on tour during the period under report. Satisfactory progress was made during the year 1910 in the matter of ci a i mg . claims. The last of the old outstand ing claims, that of the Godar Bridge repairs, which had been outstanding since 1903-04, and which had received the attention of His Majesty's Consul in the previous year, 1909, (vide Ad ministration Report, 1909), was brought to the notice of the Acting Ilkhani and Ilbegi during the spring of the year under review, with the result that they eventually gave an order to pay, by deduction from the instalments of the subsidy payable quarterly by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the total sum due, less only the compound interest for the period 3rd March 1909 to 2nd March 1910. Of new claims, that of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, aggregating 2,637 krans, for outstandings against Persian merchants, and a small sum for a minor robbery near Shalili, was the only one notified. The matter was taken up with Haji Fakhr-ul-Mulk, Governor-General, Arabistan, with the result that, at the end of the year, when leaving Ahwaz en route to Kerbala on leave, he gave His Majesty's Consul an order on the Deputy Governor of Shushtar to take up the matter of the collection of Messrs. Lynch Brothers' outstandings.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. ^ A claim for articles stolen from His Majesty's Consul, while on tour, at Sarkhun, aggregating 240 krans, remained unsettled, owing to the non-receipt of answers to letters addressed to the Bakhtiari Chiefs on the subject, and their non-arrival in the Low Country prior to the close of the year. A claim of some 6,000 krans exists for articles stolen from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company at Darra Khazineh, but this having been dealt with by the Mohammerah Consulate, further mention is unnecessary here except that the sum m toto was recovered by His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, in February 1911. B ritish I nterests. Lynch Road. —Early in January a case occurred in connection with the Messrs. Lynch Brothers. f ^ r0ad ' whicl1 g aVe a g reat deal of trouble. In January, on the arrival of a specie caravan belonging to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, in Malamir the Acting Ilkhani and Acting Ilbegi, namely, Yussuf Khan, Amir-i-Muj ahid and Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Mufiakham, distrained on two boxes of specie (value 30,000 krans) on the pretext that they were entitled to remuneration for the protection of specie caravans. They main tained that the matter had been discussed the previous year with Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Ispahan Agent, one Mirza Fazlullah Khan, who had offered them 3 per cent., whereas they claimed 5 per cent, and that, no arrangement having been come to, they had taken their present action- The occurrence was reported to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, by whom representations were made to the Sardar Assad, who at that time was Minister of the Interior. The Sardar Assad sent telegraphic orders to the Acting Chiefs to despatch the specie at once to Tehran, which orders, however, the Acting Chiefs sted- fastly refused to comply with. At the same time the Minister of Interior attempted to repudiate all responsibility for the safety of specie caravans. In view of this repudiation of responsibility Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Tehran Agent advised Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Ahwaz Agent to discontinue forward- ment for the present, and the onus of responsibility was shifted on to the Persian Government. Negotiations were opened in Tehran between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Agent, with the result that the Chiefs undertook responsibility, for two specie forwardments. The Acting Chiefs were notified regarding the intention of Messrs. Lynch Brothers Ahwaz to despatch the first of these, and were asked if their guards were ready, to which they replied in the affirmative. On the arrival however of the specie caravan in E-am Hormuz, where the Acting Chiefs then were, they re fused to supply guards and delayed the forwardment, pending our accession to their demand of 5 per cent, protection money. It being now May and the Acting Chiefs on the point of leaving for the High Country, His Majesty s Consul thought it advisable that the Minister of Interior should be pressed to order the Acting Chiefs to take up the delayed specie with them, which, it delayed in the Low Country, and the Acting Chiefs gone, would m a i pro - ability have been delayed indefinitely. The requisite orders were sent and the Acting Chiefs compelled to take the delayed specie with them. Since then Messrs. Lynch Brothers' Tehran Agent has been negotiating with the Chiefs on the question of specie forwardments, but up to the end 01 the year no arrangement arrived at. Godar Bridge.— Little or no progress has been made during the year under report in the negotiations proceeding between Messrs. Lynch Brothers Tehran Agent and the Bakhtiari Chiefs with regard to the very ^oessary re pairs to the Godar Bridge, etc., the two P artl f , hayin g/ e d^/T v ™ h passe over the question of the amount to be paid for same, Messr-. Brothers naming 60,000 krans, while the Chiefs refuse to pay mo 40,000 krans. 1 . .r, ^ +Q i S. S.

A. Wilson proceeded to take charge of the Tehran Agency, being replaced by Mr. Eedfern from that Agency, who in turn was relieved in the month of October by Mr. Tod from Baghdad and went on leave to Europe. Mr. Abel has remained Assistant throughout the year, and has been in sole charge of the Transport business. Progress of Work. —The laying of the pipe line was commenced in mu a i t» • /vi rt February under the direction of The Anglo-Persian Oil Co. ^ ^ ^ Mr. Ritchie, Pipe-Line Superintendent, assisted by a staff of 23 Europeans. Pipe laying continued throughout the remainder of the year, but it is unlikely that the line will be complete much before the end of 1911, as was foretold in the last Administration Report of this Consulate. The labour employed is, at an average figure 200 Bakhtiaris at the Field, and, in the winter months, another number ranging not more than 100 for road mending. The Bakhtiari Guards employed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at the Fields at the end of the year were as follows :— At Masj id Suleiman Oil Field— 2 heads of guards, 11 sowars, and 26 footmen. At Mamatain Field— 2 heads of guards, 10 sowars, and 16 footmen. At pumping station— 2 heads of guards, 5 sowars, and 5 footmen. Good medical work has been done at the Oil Fields among the Bakhtiaris by Dr. M. Y. Young, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and during the summer, while he was on leave in Europe, by Drs. M. Turnbull and F. M. Kay who both took turns up at the Field. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company opened a pipe-line office in Ahwaz, in the month of February, and a dispensary in the month of April, the latter in the charge of Dr. M. Turnbull for a time, and, on his transfer at the end of the year to the refinery on Abadan Island, in the charge of Dr. F. M. Kay. {ii) Relations with the BakhU'aris. —The most notable of the Oil Com pany's affairs with the Bakhtiaris during the year under review, was with regard to land acquisition. The negotiations were opened in February by Mr. G. B. Reynolds, then General Fields Manager, who, after grossly mis managing affairs, had, with the acquiescence of the Managing Agents, Messrs. Lloyd Scott &amp; Co., to hand over the conduct of negotiations to His Majesty's Consul; owing to the seriousness of the situation. His Majesty's Consul, accompanied by the Managing Agent, Mr. G. B. Lloyd, proceeded at once on tour to visit the Bakhtiari Chiefs, who were then in Kina (near Ram Hormuz). Eleven days were spent there in negotiations, which were both pro tracted and difficult, at the end of which, however, an Agreement was arrived at whereby the Anglo-Persian Oil Company paid £5,000 ' on account' for all land already taken up or to be taken up to February—March 1911, when the negotiations were to be commenced afresh—thereby rectifying the serious blunders made by Mr. G. B. Reynolds, the General Fields Manager. In July, owing to the absence of His Majesty's Consul on long tour to Ispahan, a Consular enquiry was held by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, His Majesty's Acting Consul, Mohammerah, at the Oil Field, with regard toPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 53 charges made against Ahmed Khan (British Indian subject) of inciting Bakhtiaris at the Oil Field to shoot Mr. Williams, then Assistant Fields Manager, and Dr. Turnbull. The finding of the enquiry was ' not guilty.' The terms of the guarding Agreement, concluded in 1909, by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's own representative, have proved unsatisfactory, of which fact the Managing Agents informed His Majesty's Consul, towards th^ end of the year under report, and intimated that they wished a revision of the' terms of the said Agreement. The attitude of the Bakhtiari Khans as a whole remains friendly towards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but not so that of the Lurs in the vicinity of the Oil Company's works in the Bakhtiari country. The land belonging to these Lurs is occupied by the Company's works, but the owners receive little or no redress for their land so rendered useless to them, and are not likely to either, even when the land compensation is paid to the Bakhtiari Khans; with the only natural result that they are inimical towards the Company, which to the Lur is the visible means of his trouble. The main fault then will of course lie at the door of the Bakhtiari Khans should they not compen sate their ryots, 'but a certain amount, in His Majesty's Consul's opinion, lies at the Company's door, or rather at the door of the Company's Agents on the spot. For this reason, in cases where standing crops have been damaged, arbitrary and roughshod methods have been put in force with the owners with regard to compensation for same, leaving them discontented and with a sense of injustice and wrong done to them, when, with the exercise of a little tact and diplomacy, no more need have been paid in compensation and the owner sent away satisfied. A further point which has a bearing on the Lurs' attitude towards the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, is that they (tlfe Lurs), subsequent on the Nationalist movement in Persia, are out of hand, and have not their former fear of their Chiefs, and their power to control them. Political.—Dmmg the year under report relations between His Majes ty's Consulate and that of the Nether- Foreign Interests and Activities. and the Russian Consular Agency have been most friendly. Up to the close of the year no further local developments had taken place with regard to the Dutch option for irrigation works from the Karun. Commercial—The firm of ter Meulen, Gratama and Company, (Holland- Persia Trading Company) are still the only local rivals of Messrs. Lyncn Brothers. They have undertaken a small amount of the carrying trade be- tween Ahwaz and Ispahan, chiefly that of tobacco for the Company (downward loads), but it is an open secret that they find it dithcult to make both ends meet, last year's business being scarcely be ere y of 1910.

Meanwhile Amanullah Khan made a raid on his father's Camp at Amla and succeeded in carrying off a certain amount of loot. Hostilities seemed imminent, and the Wali prepared in real earnest to crush his rebellious son ^f^ke Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Kermanshah, interviewed and finally arranged a peace between father and son during his visit to the Wali, while en route at the end of the year from Kermanshah to Shiraz on being appointed Governor-General of the Province of Pars. Amanullah Khan has again increased his administrative possessions, and it is not un likely that the peace will be short-lived. Among the incidents of minor importance may be mentioned the deputa tion, in the spring, of a transport officer by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to buy mules from the Wali, which were safely obtained, and the granting of the title of Amir-i-Jang to the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, and that of Sardar Ashraf to his second son, Ghulam Shah Khan. Disorder has reigned supreme in Luristan throughout the year under re- Luristan- port. Governors-General following each other with kaleidoscopic frequency. In February, Sardar Piruz arrived in Burujird to take up the Governor- Generalship, vice Saif-ud-Din Mirza. He started his regime unfortunately, being worsted in a fight with the Bairanwand, with whom he afterwards made peace, through the agency of Sarum-us-Sultaneh, one of the leading men of Burujird. The appointment of Seyyid Mehdi Khan, Amir-ul-Ashiyir, as Deputy Governor of Khurramabad, was confirmed by the Sardar Piruz on arrival, but his authority over the turbulent tribesmen in and around the seat of his Deputy Governorship, was as nebulous as that of his superior, which is testi fied to by the constant disorder in and around Khurramabad. Early in the summer the Sardar Piruz finding himself utterly unable to cope with the situation, resigned, and was replaced as Governor-General by the Muntassir-ud-Dowleh, until whose arrival the post was held fro-tem by Haji Bashir-ul-Mamalik, who was as powerless as the Sardar Piruz. During the latter days of the Sardar's Governorship the inhabitants of Burujird, utterly disgusted at the lack of law and order, applied to Nazar Ali Khan, Path-us-Sultan, to come and restore order, which he promised to do, but never fulfilled. Later, finding the situation in no way ameliorated on Haji Bashir-ul- Mamalik ? s appointment, the Burujirdis applied to the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh to restore order, who, however, referred them to Tehran, with the result that Nazar Ali Khan, Path-us-Sultan, was ordered to take in hand the restoration of order in Kahavand, Burujird and Malayir. This he'did, taking up his quarters with a mixed force of Silsileh and Dilfan Lurs at a place called Khaweh-i-Kuchik, near Burujird, whence he wrote to the Mafakir-ul-Mulk, Peshkar ' of Luristan, and other of the recalcitrant Lur Chiefs, threatening them with entire destruction should they create trouble. This threat had a salutary effect, and order was restored, but only temporarily however, for on the Muntassir-ud-Dowleh's arrival, in July, Nazar Ali Khan, Path-us-Sultan, having made pecuniary demands on him, which were refused, the latter with drew his support from the newly arrived Governor-General. On his arrival Muntassir-ud-Dowleh proclaimed martial law and set about collecting the outstanding taxes, a certain amount of which he was able to coerce the tribes men into paying, but on trying conclusions with the Bairanwand he was worsted, and on more than one occasion had his camp attacked and looted by them. Now commenced a series of intrigues on the part of Nazar Ali Khan, Path-us-Sultan, who had set himself up in opposition to the Governor-Gen eral, and the Governor-General himself, to ingratiate themselves with the various Lur Chiefs, with the result that the Salar Akram, Ya Eahima, andI POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910 55 the sub-tribes, owning allegiance to him, and the Chiefs of the Baiulwand took sides with the Governor-General, while the Sarum-us-Sultaneh, with his sub -tribes and the remaining Lur Chiefs joined Nazar Ali Khan Fath-us- Sultan. With these allies the Governor-General continued his efforts to coerce the Lur tribes into paying their taxes, with but little success however Early in the autumn, the Governor-General made a false move, which resulted in his downfall and nearly cost him his life. Having, by treachery, captured Latif Khan, Sarum-us-Sultaneh, he put him to death, and thereby alienated the syniT pathies of even those Lur Chiefs who were supporting him, for the reason that Latif Khan was an influential man and nearly related to many of the Lur Chiefs. The Lurs on hearing of Latif Khan's death, rose against the Gover nor -General, who finding himself without any support, had to flee for his life from Burujird. Before getting clear of his province he was attacked and looted of all his property by his assailants, narrowly escaping with his life. The year closed with the appointment of the Amir Afgham, Hissam-ul- Mulk, Hamadani, to be Governor-General of Luristan. The internal history of the tribes throughout the year has been one of raids, bloodshed, and disorder. Among other events of importance during the period under review, may be mentioned the appointment of Mirza Ali Akbar as Secret Service Agent for the Ahwaz Consulate in Burujird early in the spring, while about the same time a similar post was created by the Russian Government and a man, by name Assadullah Mirza, was installed. This Assadullah Mirza has shown great activity since his appointment in ingratiating himself with the Lur Chiefs, and is credited with intriguing with Latif Khan, Sarum-us-Sultaneh (mentioned supra), a man of reactionary tendencies, with the object of stirring up trouble and so affording the Russians a pretext for introducing Russian troops into Luristan. Towards the end of the summer the Singer's Agency, which had been open in Burujird for about a year, was closed. Throughout the year Constitutionalism has been at a very low ebb in Luristan; in the month of January a monthly paper the ' Joza' was started in Burujird, the tone of which was strongly anti-medjliss, which it held up to ridicule and abused in no measured or ' drawing room ' terms. In the sum mer, a special delegate having arrived from Tehran, various Anjumans were nominally opened, but shortly after even the name of them ceased to exist, owing to opposition on the part of the Lur Chiefs and lack of funds, and throughout the remainder of the year, the Lurs, unhampered by Constitu tional Institutions, have continued to indulge in their favourite occupation of looting and robbing each other and all who may fall into their clutches. Internal Relations. —The year under review has proved no exception to former years, and the history of Bakh- Bakhtians. ^ erna i relations is one long sequence of bickerings, quarrels, and intrigue of either individual members or all the members collectively of one family against those of the rival family. Subsequent on the quarrels there have been the usual rapprochements, which are of as much value as, and which will only last just as long as did the ones which preceded them. Throughout the year under review the Ilkhaniship has been filled by Nejaf Kulli Khan, Samsam-us-Sultaneh, while the Ilbegiship has been in the hands of Ghulam Hussein Khan, Sardar Muhtesham. Owing, however, to their continual absence in Tehran from the Bakhtiari country, their posts, as executives of the tribes, have been filled by various of the lesser Chiefs. Early in January Ghulam Ali Khan, Hissam-us-Sultaneh, and Habibullah Khan (son of the late Sardar Assad) proceeded to Gotwand and Abbed to represent the executive Chiefs in those places, followed by Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i- Muffakham, and Yussuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, who took up the posts of Acting llbegi and Acting Ilkhani at Malamir in the end of January.50 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF These Chiefs were accompanied by Muhammad Jawad Khan, Muntaz- zim-ud-Dowleh, and Sultan Ali Khan, Shahab-us-Sultaneh, the former of whom was sent to Dizful, the latter to Behbehan, as is elsewhere stated. # During the time the Amirs MufEakham and Mujahid were associated in the executive of the tribes, relations between them were exceedingly strained and eventually ended in an open rupture, in connection with the Shahab-us- Sultaneh's conduct of the Kuhgelu expedition, as mentioned on page 61. Shortly after, in the month of May, the Chiefs returned to their respective homes in the Chahar Mahal. Later, in the month of June, a split occurred between Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakham, and his brother Sultan Muhammad Khan, Sardar Ashrafi the cause of which was the jealousy of the former, because the post of Gover nor-General, Ispahan, had been given to his younger brother. This quarrel was assiduously fomented by Haji Khusro Khan, Sardar-us-Zaffar, with a view to weakening the Haji Ilkhani family, by turning its members against each other, but he was unsuccessful in gaining his ultimate object, for, after a great deal of active intrigue, the two brothers later became reconciled. This reconciliation was immediately followed by a quarrel between Sultan Muhammad Khan, Sardar Ashraf, and Muhammad Jawad Khan, Muntazzim- ud-Dowleh, over the question of the division of the ill-gotten gains from the Ispahan Governorship. By the Entre-Bakhtiari Agreement of 1909 both the Haji Ilkhani and the Ilkhani families were to share the perquisites obtained from Ispahan; this the Sardar Ashraf attempted to avoid, with the result that Muhammad Jawad Khan was ostensibly put in as his Assistant Gover nor, but in reality to keep an eye on the ill-gotten gains, which the Sardar was attempting to divert in their entirety to his own pocket. The quarrel between the Governor-General and his Assistant became so acute, that the former sent in his resignation, which, however, was not accepted, and the breach healed by the Ilbegi, Ghulam Hussein Khan, Sardar Muhtesham, sending stringent orders to his younger brother, Sultan Muhammad Khan, to come to some modus vivendi with Muhammad Jawad Khan, which he had, perforce, to do. Early in the summer the Bakhtiari Chiefs commenced to reap among their own tribesmen the first fruits of the tree of ' Liberty, Egalite, Frater- nite,' which they had planted and so assiduously tended in 1909. The minor Chiefs and heads of sub-tribes complained that, though they and their tribes men had been instrumental in obtaining for the ruling Chiefs the highest and most highly paid posts in the land, they themselves had got ' all the kicks and none of the halfpence,' and threatened to throw off the yoke of their allegiance, unless the Chiefs alleviated their lot. The Chiefs, being in no position to risk serious internal trouble among their tribesmen at this junc ture, called a special meeting at Dizak, at which it was decided to accede to the demands of the tribesmen and lighten the burden of their taxation. This same malcontent spirit showed itself again in October, in connection with the Kashan operations; after the capture of Kashan, having possessed themselves of a large amount of loot, the minor Chiefs were ordered by the ruling Chiefs to get back the loot from their men and return it to the owners. Subsequent on this the minor Chiefs returned to Ispahan, threatened to throw off their allegiance to both the Ilkhani and the Haji Ilkhani families, and summoned Haji Ibrahim Khan, Zargham-us-Sultaneh, of the Riza Kulli branch, from Tehran, with a view to making him Ilkhani of the tribes, an ap pointment which the malcontent tribes had been considering ever since their first outbreak against the ruling Chiefs. The Zargham-us-Sultaneh came and joined hands with Fathullah Khan, Zaigham-us-Sultaneh, in Ispahan and for a short space of time matters looked serious for the ruling Chiefs, until they deputed the Ilbegi, Ghulam Hussein Khan, Sar % dar Muhtesham, and J after Kulli Khan, Sardar-i-Bahadur (son of Sardar Assad), from Tehran to settle the case, amicably, which they were successful in doing. The most notable of the events of the year, with regard to Bakhtiari in ternal relations, was the split between the two ruling families, which nearly led to bloodshed in the early autumn.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOE 1010. 67 The predisposing causes were numerous, but the radical one was the ever present enmity, whtcti exists between the members of the two families which has for its ultimate object the total extinction of the rival family the supreme and undivided control of the tribes, and a free hand in pm- suing any designs and schemes without the interference and possible opposition of the rival family. As elsewhere stated, relations between Actmg Ilbegi and Acting Ilkhani, namely, Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i^ Muffakham, and Yussuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, were exceedingly strained, while these two Chiefs were in the Low Country,, and on their meet- ing^ again at Chigakhor in the Chahar Mahal, for the summer col lection of taxes and other matters connected with tribal administra tion, matters became worse. In the month of June Haji Khusro Khan, Sar- dar-us-Zaffar, was deputed from Tehran for two objects, one to arrange mat ters between these Chiefs and secondly to collect forces and attack the Sowlet- ud-Dowleh, Kashgai. The former object he failed to attain, for the simple reason that he had no desire that the breach between the Chiefs should be healed. During the mobilization of troops for the second objective, the mem bers of the Haji Ilkhani family—more particularly Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i- Muffakham—had been growing apprehensive that they would be forced to turn against their friend the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, with whom they were in treaty, and were therefore exceedingly relieved to be afforded an opportunitv of backing out of this expedition, when telegraphic orders were received from Tehran cancelling operations. The Amir-i-Muffakham at once dis banded his troops and refused to have anything more to do with the expedi tion, though the Sardar-us-Zaffar and the Amir-i-Mujahid were prepared to disobey the orders received from Tehran. The Amir-i-Muffakham even went so far as to say that should his cousins attack the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh in the face of the orders received from Tehran, he would attack them in the rear. This threat had the effect of preventing the above mentioned members of the Ilkhani family going further in the matter as regards the Sowlet, but also had the further effect of totally estranging the Acting Executive Chiefs. Yussuf Khan now openly showed his hostility, with the result that Lutf Ali Khan resigned his post; at the instigation of Haji Khusro Khan, Sardar-us- Zaffar, the Ilkhani family forces were again remobilized and intrigues set on foot to subborn the adherents of the opposing family, with no result, except an attack on Mehti Kulli Khan, Salar-i-Masud, son of the Sardar-us-Zaffar, by Ahmed Khusrois, who refused to be tampered with. This incident was the spark in the powder, the Ilkhani adherents took the Chigakhor fort and imprisoned Ghulam Ali Khan, who had succeeded Lutf Ali Khan as Acting Ilbegi. This was followed by a general mobiliza tion of troops, and hostilities appeared imminent. After repeated telegrams from the Medjliss, and the despatch of Agha Nurullah, the most influential Cleric in Ispahan, and others to act as peace-makers, peace was made, and all the Bakhtiari Chiefs summoned to Tehran, where their differences were settled and fresh oaths of brotherhood, etc., exchanged between them. During the senior Chief's absence iif Tehran, the duties of Acting Ilkhani and Acting Ilbegi were performed by Muhammad Takki Khan, Ziya-us-Sul- tan, and Ali Akbar Khan, Salar Ashraf. The year closed with the appoint ment of Ghulam Husein Khan, Sardar Muhtesham, and Jaffer Kulli Khan, Sardar Bahadur, to the posts of Ilbegi and Acting Ilkhani respectively, while the Ziya-us-Sultan and the Bahadur-us-Sultaneh were appointed to represent the Chiefs at Andaka and Qala Zaras. The closing year saw the Bakhtiaris divided into two factions : the Sardar Assad and all the other Chiefs of the Hussein Kulli Branch on the one side, while on the other were ransred the Sardar Muhtesham and the remain ing Chiefs of the Haji Imam Kuli Branch; the latter being in touch and m agreement with the southern coalition, composed of the Shaikh of Moham- merah and the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. External Relations .—Tut external relations of the Bakhtiari Chiefs during the year 1910 have been equally troubled. ^58 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF Baklitiari intrigues to undermine the Shaikh of Mohammerah's authority with his tribesmen, which were set on foot in 1909, have continued throughout the year, through the agency of Agha Eahim, Bakhtiari, the Deputy Governor of Dizful. It will be remembered that in 1909 he tried to stir up various Shaikhs of the Bani Turuf and Maulas of Hawizeh, subsequent on which he was summoned to Mohammerah by the Governor-General of Arabistan, Haji Fakhr-ul-Mulk, to make his peace with Shaikh Khazal. Later, in February, on the pretext that the Kharran lands, situated in Arabistan, were the pro perty of the Gunduzlu, the Acting Ilkhani and Acting Ilbegi, sent agents to collect taxes from the Arabs, inhabiting those lands, and at the same time in- stigatefl the A1 Khamis Arabs, who live in Bakhtiari territory to attack and loot the A1 Amur Arabs, who are the Shaikh of Mohammerah's subjects. After telegraphic communication on the subject, Haji Seyyid Hussein, Shaikh Khazal's agent in Ahwaz was sent to Malamir to interview the Acting Chiefs. Meanwhile taxes to the amount of some 300 tomans were collected in the Kharran, and some Arabs, who refused payment, made prisoners. The result of Shaikh Khazal's agent's interview with the Acting Chiefs was that the question should be further discussed by them and Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, the Shaikh of Mohammerah's Wazir at Ramuz and that meanwhile the taxes collected were to be returned, which latter however was not done. The result of the meeting between Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar and the Acting Chiefs was unsatisfactory, the only decision arrived at being that the disput ants to the lands in question should send deputies to Tehran, there to have the question of ownership thrashed out in the Medjliss. In the summer it was de cided in Tehran that the lands, which had been leased by Shaikh Khazal, Haji Ilais and others, belonged to the Seyyids of Shushtar, but up to the end of the year the owners had not asserted their rights, nor had the taxes, collect ed in the spring, been returned. It is surmised that Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, who, in the autumn of 1910, was appointed the agent of the owners, wishes to further discuss the matter with the Bakhtiari Chiefs, on their return to the Low Country. The Acting Executive Chiefs also prosecuted their intrigues against Shaikh Khazal's authority in other directions. During the spring they tried to tamper with Shaikh Hyder of the El Kathir, but with no success, also with Shaikh Farhan Ass^d of the same tribe, with no immediate apparent result. Later, however, in the autumn. Shaikh Farhan Assad rebelled against the Shaikh of Mohammerah, having been instigated thereto by Agha Rahim, Bakhtiari, who gave him a Koran sealed by the Sardar-us-Zaffar, promising him assistance. Further, from intercepted letters, it was established with out a doubt that the Ilkhani family of the Bakhtiaris, headed by the Sardar Assad in Tehran, were intriguing against the Shaikh of Mohammerah; these and the events which took place, proving the correctness of His Majesty's Consul's prognostications, made in the autumns of 1909 and 1910, that the Ilkhani branch of the Bakhtiaris were inimical to Shaikh Khazal and were determined, if possible, to cause him trouble. In November Shaikh Khazal informed the Amir-i-Muffakham that he was sending an army against Shaikh Farhan Assad, to which he received a reply that he (Lutf Ali Khan) was prepared to act in accordance with the Secret Agreement made between them. The Haji Ilkhani adherents 'were notified to be ready to assist the Shaikh of Mohammerah in the event of the Ilkhani adherents assisting Shaikh Farhan Assad. An army numbering about 10,000 was despatched from Ahwaz, on the 16th November, under the command of Shaikh Handzal; Deh Nao, Shaikh Farhan Assad's head-quarters was captured, and Shaikh Farhan himself fled with Agha Rahim Khan, Ajam Khan and Ali Nakki Khan, Bakhtiari adherents of the Ilkhani family, who were with him at the time, to Bakhtiari territory, where he was afforded asy lum. The Shaikh of Mohammerah's army was disbanded, and since then to the close of the year Shaikh Farhan Assad has been waiting, in the apparent expectation of the arrival of the Executive Bakhtiari Chiefs in the Low Coun try, who are charged from Tehran with the settlement of the case. Another cause cdebre of Bakhtiari external relations during the year was the trouble with the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, Kashgai. The main cause of thePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 59 trouble would appear to be tlie attitude adopted by the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh as a counterpoise to the Bakhtiari predominance in Tehran, while the im mediate causes were the looting by the Kashgai of the Laraki (Turks), who have become Bakhtiari subjects through taking up their residence in Bakh tiari territory, counter raids in reprisal for same, the looting of the Ispahan district by Kashgais, and the protection afforded to Garib Khan by the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh. The question became acute in June, when the Sardar-us-ZafEar was or dered to mobilize an army to attack the Sowlet, who in turn threatened to march Oh Ispahan and Tehran. Both sides mobilized their forces and a colli sion seemed imminent. No serious collision occurred however, only an affair of outposts occurring at Ganduman, near Imam Qais, in the vicinity of which, both forces were massing. During this time emissaries were constantly going to and fro, trying to arrange terms, and on the receipt of telegraphic orders from Tehran cancelling the expedition, the Haji Ilkhani Branch of the Bakh- tiaris, as elsewhere stated, withdrew their support, with the result that no further action was taken against the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, and the Sardar-us- Zaffar's intrigue turned into another channel, as mentioned supra under ' Internal Relations.^ In connection with the above it is interesting to note that, in April, when in the Low Country, Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakham, made a secret agree ment for mutual support with Shaikh Khazal, the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and that when the collision between the Bakhtiaris and the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh was impending, the latter telegraphed to Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah asking his assistance in accordance with the agreement, which had been made between them and the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh in the spring. This telegraphic request for assistance, which was in code, caine to the knowledge of His Majest/s Consul, Ahwaz, who was at that time in Ispahan, who at once in formed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Shaikh of Moham- merah was warned not to interfere. Among the minor events Of Bakhtiari external relations may be men tioned the trouble with the Burburidis, regarding the question of grazing rights and payment for same, which resulted in the killing of some and the total looting of the rest of the Bakhtiari Mamurs (agents) sent to collect pay- lilent by the Burburidis, and a raid by the Hajiwand, in connection with the same question^ on the Camp of Muhammad Jawad Khan, Muntazzim-ud- Dowleh, at Abbed. Uelations with the Central Government. —As the question of relations with the Central Government hardly now comes within the purview oi t is Consulate, only the question of posts. Governorships, etc., held will be dea with. During the month of March Muhammad Jawad Khan, Muntazzim-ud- Dowleh, was deputed^ with a small force of sowars to assist the Governor- General of Arabistan in collecting outstanding taxes in Dizfu . In April, 400 Bakhtiari Sowars, under Jafier Kulli Khan, Sardar-]- Bahadur, together with 170 fedais, 100 Persian oossacks and some y under V oprem were despatched to subdue the Shaseven tribe, w ic a e pillaging in the Ardabil district. ^ The expedition returned about a month later, having accomplished their mission sucGessfuily. In the month of March Garib Khan revolted and Sultan Muhammad Khan, Sardar Ashraf, at that time Governor*General, Is P aha ^ J 6 ' 4 X force, said to number 1,400 men, to Kumisheh to subdue him. quelled, but Garib Khan escaped. In the spring a punitive expedition was despa^ Ae Sultan Ali Khan, Shahab-us-Sultaneh being in command • fo r f urt ^ r and Governorship of Behbehan see heading Kuhgelus (page bl). In May Haji Ali Kulli Khan, Sardar Assad, ^af aJd Interior, exchanged pests with the Sipahdar, becomi g ^60 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF later, in July, on the dissolution of the Cabinet, the Sardar Assad was elected a member of the Medjliss. On the 4th January, Sultan Muhammad Khan, Sardar Ashraf, took over the Governor-Generalship of Ispahan, in succession to Nejaf Kulli Khan, Samsam-us-Sultaneh. Later, in the summer, Muhammad Jawad Khan, Mun- tazzim-ud-Dowleh, was appointed as his assistant. The Sardar Ashraf held the post of Governor-General, Ispahan, till the 10th October, when he was suc ceeded by Shukrullah Khan, Motamid-i-Khagan. Mahmud Khan, Hujabr-us-Sultan, held the Governorship of Kashan for a few months in the early part of 1910. The Governor-Generalship of Yezd was held by Nasir Khan, Sardar-i- Jang, till the 11th September, when he left his post, without the permission of the Central Government, in connection with the inter-Bakhtiari family troubles mentioned elsewhere, being succeeded by the Zaigham-ud-Dowleh. Haji Khusro Khan, Sardar-us-Zaffar, was appointed Governor-General of Kerman, in June, but never joined his post, which however was filled for a time by his sons Ilyas Khan, Sarum-ul-Mulk, and Iskandar Khan till the 7th October. Subsequent on the inter-family quarrels, all Governorships were taken out of the hands of the Bakhtiari Khans, who were summoned to Tehran, as elsewhere stated. En route, Naib Hussein-i-Kashi having occupied Kashan,, early in October, some of the Bakhtiari Khans were ordered to subdue him. Kashan was invested by a force of Bakhtiaris under Haji Khusro Khan, Sardar-us-Zaffar, and Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-MuSakham, and various of the lesser Chiefs. The town was eventually bombarded and captured on the 30th October, but Naib Hussein, with a small following, managed to make good his escape. In the operations before Kashan the Bakhtiaris losses numbered between 20 and 30 killed, including some of the lesser Chiefs. At the end of the year, on account of his intrigues, Agha Rahim Khan Bakhtiari, was dismissed his post and Agha Sohrab Khan, Bakhtiari, appointed Deputy Governor of Dizful in his place. Relations with the British. —In general the improvement in the tone of the Bakhtiari Chiefs towards British interests, chronicled last year, has been maintained, though unfortunately, owing to the personality of the two Chiefs, namely, Lutf Ali and Yussuf Khans, charged with the tribal executive, some unpleasantly troublesome questions became acute during the spring of 1910, most notably among these being the Land Acquisition Question, with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the Specie Question, with Messrs. Lynch Brothers, both of which have been dealt with under their respective heads. When on tour, in October, an assault was committed on His Majesty's Consul at Sarkhun by two Lurs, who had crept into the tent with the intent of theft. Due punishment df the offenders was secured. Ifi the summer the Chiefs had under consideration the question of em ploying Dr. (Miss E. M.) Ross, who was at that time practising at Deh Kurd in the Chahar Mahal, as Lady Doctor to their wives; no final decision was however arrived at. The relations between His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz, and the Chiefs have . been most cordial throughout the year. Titles. —The titles held by the more important of the Chiefs, during the year under review, are shewn in an Appendix. The Kuhgelu country has been disturbed throughout the year under Kuh elus review, inter-tribal fighting having been almost continuous during that period. As reported in the Administration Report for 1909, Ilyas Khan, Sarum- ul-Mulk, son of Haji Khusro Khan, Sardar-us-Zaffar, arrived in Behbehan, in December 1909, to take up the joint Governorship of that place, and wasPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 61 followed, in January 1910, by his colleague Fath Ali Khan, Salar-i-Muiyid, who represented the Haji Ilkhani family in the joint Governorship. From the very inception of their Governorship relations between them were strained and, in March, there was an open rupture between them, resulting in the resignation of Ilyas Khan, Sarum-ul-Mulk, who at once proceeded to his home at Junaghum in the Chahar Mahal, followed by the recall of Fath Ali Khan, Salar-i-Muiyid. In the month of April Sultan Ali Khan, Shahab-us-Sul- taneh, and Habibullah Khan were despatched to Behbehan, with a small force, to take up the joint Governorship, the former representing the Ilkhani family and the latter the Haji Ilkhani family of the Bakhtiaris. About this time an expedition against the Tebi sub-tribe was planned, but was rendered a complete failure, owing to intrigue and mter-family jealousy on the part of the representatives of the two Bakhtiari families. This matter is dealt with sufra. On the failure of the Tebi expedition and, sub sequent on a quarrel between the then Acting Ilkhani and Acting Ilbegi of the Bakhtiaris, namely, Yussuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, and Lutf Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakham, Sultan Ali Khan was recalled from his joint Governor ship, followed by his colleague. On the departure df the Bakhtiari represen tatives in Behbehan from that place, the former Deputy Governor, Mirza Ali Riza Khan, Bahadur-i-Diwan, who had since been restored to the uncertain heights of Bakhtiari favour, was appointed Deputy Governor. Immediately on his re-accession to power, the Bahadur-i-Diwan commenced to repay the inhabitants of the Kanawat quarter for the part they had played in the previ ous year in assisting to take him prisoner and despoil his house. In the summer of 1910 the Bakhtiaris, although openly giving out that they had given up the Governorship of the Kuhgelu, on account of the turbulence of the tribe, were, however, secretly discussing the possibility of undertaking the Governorship during the coming winter and spring, and decided that Yussuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, was a fitting person for the post, being related to the Bahamai sub-tribe by marriage. Later, in the summer, Hussein Khan, Baha- mai was appointed ilkhani of the Kuhgelu, though his post was merely nomi nal, as many of the sub-tribes would not acknowledge his authority, and, subse quent on his assumption of that title, was entrusted with the difficult task of assisting the Deputy Governor of Behbehan to keep order. This trust he signally failed to keep, for, early in the autumn, severe fighting broke out in Behbehan, between the two mohalls (quarters) Kanawat and Behbehan, which continued intermittently till the month of December and was attended with a large loss of life. Consequent on the fighting in Behbehan, the tribes took sides, at first the Boir Ali and the Bahamai sided with the Kanawatis, and the Jegatai and Tebi with the Behbehanis, but later, as the effect of parti sanship spread, more of the more distant sub-tribes became involved and, before the cessation of fighting, in December, the Ahmedi Bahamai, the Dush- man Ziari and the Boir Ahmedi, owning allegiance to Shukrullah Khan, had joined hands with the Kanawatis, while on the side of the Behbehanis were the Mohmadi Bahamai, the Tebi (Garmsiri and Sarhaddi) and the Boir Ahmedi, owning allegiance to the Aulad-i-Karim Khan. The year closed with the cessation of fighting in Behbehan and the expec tation that the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, the Governor-General elect of Fars, would, on arrivail in Shiraz, take the Deputy Governorship out of the hands of the Bahadur-i-Diwan and entrust it to either some nominee of his own or of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. As mentioned in the Administration Report for 1909, Mirza Ali Riza Khan, Bahadur-i-Diwan, was imprisoned immediately on the arrival oi the Bakhtiari Governor of Behbehan. Later, in the spring of 1910, he was con ducted to Malamir to appear before the Acting Ilkhani and Acting Ijbegi of the Bakhtiaris, by whom he was a short time later released, given a khilaat {robe of honour) and allowed to return to Behbehan with all the marks o Bakhtiari favour, for which, he, no doubt, had to pay handsomely. W i e imprisoned he got into secret communication with the Acting Ilbegi, u Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakham, through whose mediation he was later release .^2 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF The tribal history of the year under review has nothing to shew but rebellions and constant inter-tribal warfare. In the month of January Amur Agha of the Agha Jirri rebelled against the Bakhtiari Governor of Behbehan and successfully defied his every effort to coerce him till he was brought to heel by a forte of Bahamai and Shukrullah Boir Ahmedi Kuhgelus^ whom the Governor of Behbehan instigated to attack him. In the spring of 1910, the Acting Ilkhani and Acting Ilbegi summoned headmen from the Tebi and Boir Ahmedi tribes to appear before them at Malamir, and their non-compliance was made a pretext by the Bakhtiaris for the despatch of an expeditionary force against the former tribe. The conduct of the operations against Ali Murad Khan of the Tebi, was at first entrusted to Hussein Khan of the Ahmedi Bahamai, who are in touch With the Ilkhani Branch of the Bakhti aris, but on Sultan Ali Khan, Shahab-us-Sultaneh, being appointed Governor of Behbehan, owing to his jealousy of Hussein Khan's successes and further on account of the fact that Ali Murad Khan of the Tebi is in touch with the Haji ilkhani family of the Bakhtiaris, of which Sultan Ali is also a member, Hussein Khan was superseded in the supreme command by Sultan Ali Khan, who at once made peace with Ali Murad Khan and invested him with a robe of honour. This action on Sultan Ali KMn's part led to a rupture of the already strained relations existing between the Acting Ilkhani and the Acting Ilbegi of the Bakhtiaris, which resulted in Sultan Ali Khan's recall from Behbehan and the withdrawal, in May, of the expeditionary force from the Tebi territory, without accomplishing anything more than embroiling the Ahmedi Bahamai in an implacablie blood feud with the Tebi. The failure of this expedition, which was a golden opportunity for the Bakhtiaris not only to make themselves masters of a tribe, which harasses the Bakhtiari (Lynch) road continually, but also gradually to subjugate all the Kuhgelu tribes, may be traced directly to the intense and ever present hatred of the two Bakhtiari families the one for the other. Consequent on the blood feud, which arose as above stated, between the Ahmedi Bahamai and the Tebi {Sarhaddi)^ these two tribes were engaged in internecine warfare all through the summer^ the advantage being on the side of the Bahamai. Later, in autumn, tney were joined by some of the Tebi themselves under Mulla Walli, Biawash, and Khan Ali Khans and the inves- ture of Qala Raesi, in which fort Ali Murad Khan had taken up his stand, was commenced, and the year closed with desultory fighting still going on. Among the events of lesser importance may be mentioned {i) the deten tion of three hostages from the Kuhgelu for the good behaviour of their siib- tribes by the Bakhtiari Khans in the Lligh Country—on internal dissensions breaking out among the Bakhtiari Khans in the summer^ these hostages were set free—and (ii) the policing, during the summer of the Sarrak-Pul-i- Amarat section of the Lynch (Ahwaz-Ispahan) road by the Bahamai, under the orders of Hussein Khan. Lastly^ among the matters worthy of note may be mentioned the proffer of assistance by the Boir Ahmedi, under Mulla Kobad, to the Sowlet-ud-Dowleh, when he was threatening to invade Bakhtiari territory in the vicinity of Imam Qais, arid the attack near Slmlgistan by members of the same tribe on Mr. Bill, His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, when en route to Ispahan, in the spring of 1910. XT , Northern Arabistan has been in an un- or em ra istan. settled state during the period under review. The district in the vicinity of Dizful has been the scene of constant raids by the Sagwand and Dirakwand Lurs and the Khasrij Arabs, and the towns of Dizful and Shushtar have been the scene of intermittent inter-mohall a (quarter) fighting. In the former town the most serious outbreak was subse quent to the arrest of the Amad-ud-Daftar by Muhammad Jawad Khan, Muntazzim-ud-Dowleh, on a charge of refusal to pay taxes. In Shushtar the trouble was greater and of longer duration. Trouble commenced to brew in January between the various mohallas, the cause of which was the enmity ofPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 63 the two factions, into which the Khans of Shushtar are divided, coupled with the fact that the Governor-General, Arabistan, Haji Fakhr-ul-Muik, who resides in Shushtar is absolutely powerless to hold them in check. An out break occurred in February, subsequent on which affairs went from had to worse, till the matter came to a head over the question of the right of various of the Khans to lease certain watermills and the Gotwand perry, mohallas (quarters) were barricaded and street-fighting became the order of the day, in which many casualties occurred. The Governor-General, being powerless to cope with the situation, the Shaikh of Mohammerah summoned the various heads of mohallas to Mohammerah, subsequent on which there was a cessation of hostilities. Immediately on their return, however, from Mohammerah, fresh trouble broke out, which ended in Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah receiving orders from Tehran to put a stop to the trouble, by force of arms if necessary. The Shaikh of Mohammerah collected a force, in August, encam ped at Bend-i-Kir, some 28 miles south of Shushtar, summoned the headmen and Khans of Shushtar, settled the matter and banished Shaikh Murteza, who is a notorious rogue—since when Shushtar has enjoyed comparative tranquillity. In connection with the above troubles, in July, neither Messrs. Lynch Brothers' boat the S. S. ' Shushan ' nor the Nasiri Company's boat the S. S. ' Muavin ' were able to go to Shushtar for about a fortnight. In January, trouble occurred in the Hussainabad lands, situate in the Dizful district. Shaikh Hyder of the El Kathir attacked and looted Shaikh Khurrabit of the same tribe, taking Shaikh Khurrabit himself prisoner, after which he crossed the Karkha river and camped on the further side. Shaikh Farhan Assad also of the El Kathir, assisted by Shaikh Nassi of the Chab-i- Dubais immediately followed up and attacked Shaikh Hyder, who however escaped. Later, at the end of April, Shaikh Hyder made his peace with the Shaikh of Mohanimerah, who is his over-lord, and Shaikh Khurrabit was restored to freedom. In May Shaikh Flyder, on being ordered by the Shaikh of Mohammerah to pay a large sum in cash and kind, which he owed to Shaikh Gadzban of the Bani Lam, again became ' Yaghi ' (rebellious) and took refuge with the Sagwand. Finding however thajt they would not support him, he ' crawled in ' in June and paid up. Shaikh Farhan Assad's rebellion against the Shaikh of Mohammerah's authority, subsequent on Bakhtiari instigation, has been elsewhere dealt with. The charge of the Consulate Dispensary has been held throughout the year by Civil Hospital Assistant Fazl M6diGa1- - ' llahi, who has discharged his duties with a high degree of efficiency. The head-quarters dispensary was closed from the ^ tlie zata October as Civil Hospital Assistant Fazl llahi accompanied His Majesty s Consul on tour, during which time medical work was done in the districts passed through. The daily average attendance at the Dispensary for the period during which it was open at head-quarters during the year 1910 was 105-02, as against 93-39 for the preceding year; 57 operations having been performed during the year 1910 as against 67 in the preceding year. The daily average number of patients ^treated on tour was 31-45, as against 12-08 for the year 1909. Eye diseases, malaria and worm are the diseases most commonly met With both in Arabistan and also among the hill tribes, while those which appeared in epidemic form in hpad-quarters were small-pox, measles, whoop ing cough, influenza, while sporadic cholera shewed itself at the end of December 1910- The general health of the Consulate staff has been good during the year under reoort.64 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF \ No official visitors passed through the district during the year under Visitors review, except Sir William Willcocks, who, accompanied by Mr. Storrs and Lieutenant Wilson, His Majesty's Acting Consul, Mohammerah, had come to inspect the Kut Nahar Hashim lands, with a view to irrigation. The project was favourably reported on by Sir William W T illcocks. Dr. and Mrs. Carr of the Church Missionary Society, Ispahan, visited Ahwaz, Mohammerah, Shushtar, Dizful and Ram Hormuz on a medico-mis sionary tour in January and February. Mr. David Fraser, correspondent for the Times of India, passed through the district in January, having visited the Oil Fields en route, from Ispahan to India. s Mr. Hale of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and Lieutenants Noel, 44th Merwara Infantry, and Gray, R.E., passed through the district towards the end of the year, the former en route to Shiraz, the latter two to India. In October, Prince Troubatskoy, a Russian, passed through en route to Ispahan. He gave out that he was travelling for sport and pleasure. In addition to the above, various other travellers of minor importance passed through the district. As foretold in the paragraph on this subject, forwarded at the request of His Majesty's Acting Consul, Moham- P r ?f ress of Constitutional Institutions in mera h, for inclusion in the Moham- the Anwaz District. i, -r» j. merah Consulate Administration Report • for 1909, Constitutional Institutions in the towns of Northern Arabistan and Ahwaz have made no progress whatever, their retrogression being such that they are now only noticeable by their absence, which also is applicable to Behbehan; and in the meanwhile reactionary views are daily expressed more freely and openly. The nomadic Arabs and the hill tribes of the Ahwaz Consular District, with the exception of the Bakhtiaris, are still unaffected by and unprovided with Constitutional Institutions. Among the Bakhtiari tribesmen however the spirit of unrest and independence is spreading rapidly, with the result that the tribes are rapidly losing their former fear of their Chiefs and their power to coerce them. The Bakhtiari Khans are now reaping the first fruits among their own tribesmen of the '* azadi ' (freedom), which they themselves planted and tended so assiduously in 1909—and a bitter fruit it is proving to be. Crops. —The rainfall in the winter of 1909-10 and the spring of 1910 proving sufficient, good crops were ob- Misceiianeous. tained^and wheat for export plentiful. Meteorological. —Total rainfall 14*68 inches. Maximum temperature 116-6° in August. Minimum temperature 35-6° in January. Ahwaz Consulate Agents, etc., in Arabistan and elsewhere in the Con sular District of Ahwaz.—K Secret Service Agent was maintained throughout the year, in charge of the Dizful Consulate House, and friendly relations were maintained with many of the leading men of both the towns of Shushtar and Dizful, notably among whom were Shaikh Muhammad Hussein, Chief Mujtahid of Dizful, Shaikh Muhammad Baqir (Dizful), Mirza Tahir Khan Mustafi (Accountant-General) of Shushtar, Seyyid Abdulla Imam Juma ot Shushtar, and Mirza Abdulla of Shushtar, the latter corresponding with His Majesty's Consul as unpaid Secret Service Agent.

Captain Crossle in turn proceeded on long leave, on July 27th, and was relieved by Captain N. N. G. C. McVean who continued to hold charge till the end of the year. Monsieur A. Jeannier remained Consul for France throughout the year. Mr. J. A. Ray was American Consul Foreign Consuls. during the year, and Monsieur Umberto Omar was Italian News Agent during the year. In May, a representative of the French Consul went to Sur for the pur pose of enumerating the French Dhows there. In June, Mr. Ray paid a visit to Sib and, in October, he made a short tour to Semail. On March 17th, on his return from leave, Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Resident in the Persian Visits of Resident. at Maskat on H&gt; M S. ' Odin '. Official calls were exchanged with the Sultan and the usual salute fired. The Resident left in the ' Lawrence,' on the 19th March. On the 14th August the Resident again visited Maskat. During this visit several private calls were paid on the Sultan who also called on the Resident, and various matters were discussed. A good many outstanding cases, notably the compensation for the loss of the ganja ' Alam Dad,' dating form 1906, and the more recent but troublesome case of compensation to Mr. Harparshad Laxmansingh for wrongful dismissal, were satisfactorily settled. On the morning of 7th May the sad news of the demise of His Majesty Edward VII was received at Maskat. Demise of His Majesty Edward VII. ^ Highness the gultan, OU receipt of the news, paid a visit to the Political Agent to express his condolence with the Royal Family and country. His Highness the Sultan and the Foreign Con suls kept their flags at half mast for three days, and the bazaars were closed for one day a? a mark of respect. On the 10th, 68 minute guns were fired by H. M. S. ' Odin.' On the 20th May, the occasion of the funeral of His late Majesty, all Government offices and shops were closed, and His Highness' battery fired a salute of 68 minute guns, the last gun being fired at sunset; the flags of His Highness the Sultan and all the Consulates, which had been at half mast during the day, were hauled down on the firing of the last gun. The health of His Highness the Sultan has been good throughout the year. The relations between His High- His Highness the Sultan and family. j^gg anc [ the Agency have been on the whole good in spite of the severe strain which has been put on them by the financial straits into which His Highness has been thrown by the success of the operations for the suppression of the arms traffic. On the 13th August (7th Shahban 1328) a son was born to Seyyid Taimur. The boy has been named Saeed. During the last week of December the marriages of Seyyid Nadir and Seyyid Muhammad with two daughters of Saiyid Ali bin Salim bin Thuwaini were celebrated.

The disease appeared in Sur, in November, and was very severe there, and also in the neighbourhood. It was also bad in Rostak and the neighbourhood at the end of the year. The New Hospital was opened in the end of October, but, owing to the cholera, no public ceremony took place. It may be mentioned that His High ness did not evince any particular desire to have a public opening. The quarantine arrangements under the supervision of the Agency Sur geon worked smoothly during the year. The Customs were managed throughout the year by Superintendents on n , a , a - . behalf of the Sultan. The Superintend- (Justoms and landing arrangements. . . ■, T . ,, , . J - „ . ent at Maskat is m the habit of issuing goods received to consignees without the production of a Delivery Order or even of the Bill of Lading. As it frequently happens that banks and firms have got a lien on the goods till the cost is paid, this practice will probably lead to trouble. The attention of His Highness has been called to the matter. The Landing Contractor, Seyyid Abdul Kadir Zowavi, is quite inefficient, and complaints of theft by his men, slackness, want of boats, etc., are rife. His Highness is however deaf to all complaints against this man. There was .a report at the end of the year that the Sultan intended to farm the Customs to Habib bin Suleyim, Seyyid Yusuf Zowavi and Ali Musa, but this arrangement has apparently fallen through. During the year 1910 forty-nine persons applied for manumission certi- siavo trade. ficates either for themselves or for their relatives or both, and two sought relief against being enslaved. The latter were given letters by the Sultan to the local Walis to secure protection for them. Fifty-four persons, including chil dren, were planumitted during the year, 22 of whom were rescued through the good offices of this Agency ; 6 of these, however, having obtained their freedom from His Highness, did not come to receive their manumission certificates. One applicant whose master was a French Protege was sent to the French Consul who gave him a certificate equivalent to a freedom paper. In four cases the applicants left the Agency premises when their cases were under investigation, and in seven other cases the applicants were proved either not entitled to freedom or went back to their masters under suitable guarantees. Of the 49 applicants 16 were Africans of whom 10 were freed. The rest were all Baluchis of Mekran. The traffic in Mekranis appears to be on the increase, if anything, and by far the larger proportion of refugee slaves who come to this Agency are now Mekranis.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOE 1910.

TREVOR, Major, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. i i ll V' '-A76 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF A note on the New Charitable Maskat Mutrah Hospital hy Captain N. N. G. C. McVean, M.B., I.M.S., Agency Surgeon, Maskat. The new Maskat Mutrah Hospital was opened at the end of October 1910. It is a large roomy building with ample accommodation for twenty patients in nine different wards, thus providing separate accommodation for the different classes of patients and special accommodation for females. A ward with ample accommodation for two patients has been set aside for European patients, it is well furnished and has a bath room attached, several cases from the Navy have been healed here up to date. There is a good operation room furnished with most otf the more neces sary articles of surgical furniture and with a good supply of modern instruments. There is a roomy dispensary well equipped and a good dresser's room; the latter has not yet been fully furnished but new furniture has been ordered.' Very few operations have been performed so far, as the people are not accustomed to the idea of surgical treatment. Should the numBer of patients requiring operations increase, as it is hoped will be the case when the hospital becomes well known, the present subordinate staff is hardly adequate. Note on the Cholera epidemic in Maskat, in the Autumn of 1910, by Captain N. N. G. C. McVean, I M.S., Agency Surgeon, Maskat. Cholera broke out in Maskat towards the end of September and con tinued, till the end of November; during that time there was a period, from the 1st till the 19th of October, during which no case was heard of. The cases occurred almost entirely among the Baluchis and Seedies of the poorest classes who live outside the walls in miserable huts where the condi tions are filthy in the extreme and where there is much crowding. Only about ten cases occurred inside the town itself where the sanitary conditions are considerably better. The number of cases reported was 93, of these 81 died, but as the great majority of cases were not reported till after death it may be assumed' that many cases recovered which were not reported. However, the general health and conditions of life of the class affected is poor which would help to account for a very high mortality. Males and females were attacked in about equal proportion. About 20 of the cases were children. The cases seen presented the ordinary symptoms of cholera. Very few of the cases applied ?or medi cines or, if they did, it was only when the disease was far' advanced. The relations, etc., were advised to burn clothing and other articles infected or at least to soak them well in antiseptics, which were supplied free for this purpose. These suggestions were carried out in almost every case, and they seem to have been fairly successful as generally not more than one case occurred in each dwelling- The infection was probably brought by dhows a large number of which come here. The first cases heard of however were among people who had been living in Maskat for some time. Cholera occurred in several other places in Oman about the same time.Mmka —n. CHAPTER IX. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE TRUCIAL COAST FOR THE 1YEAR, 1910. As far as the affairs of the hinterland and the relations of the princi palities inter se, are concerned, the past year has been a peaceful and un eventful one; there has been no fighting and the Bedouins have been peace fully inclined. The affairs of the ports, however, and the relations of the Shaikhs with the British Government have been a good deal in evidence, mainly in connec tion with the developments of the arms traffic. The year at Abu Thabi and Umm-el-Kowein passed normally, and the behaviour of the Chiefs was satisfactory. The Shaikh, Abdul Aziz-bin-Homeid, was murdered by one of his house hold slaves, on 16th February, in connec tion with some family feud. The relative of the deceased who had instigated the murder, Muhammad-bin- Rashid, attempted to set himself up as Chief, but the inhabitants of Ajman expelled him and chose Homeid, the son of the late Chief, in his father's place. Homeid's succession was duly recognised by Government. The late Shaikh Abdul Aziz was an unexceedingly uncouth and ignorant person who could never speak except at a shout, and his son takes after him. It was recorded, in last year's Report, that the Shaikh of Shargah, on , . ^the' death of his son, Khalid, who had Shargah and Ras-d-Kheima. governed Eas-el-Kheima as his deputy. had, after some vacillation, appointed his uncle and actual Vazier, Shaikh Salim-bin-Sultan, as Deputy-Governor of Ras-el-Kheima. This was a matter for some surprise, but as it seemed a good sign of the concord exist ing between the two, the Resident saw no reason to discourage it. The arrangement did not however prove satisfactory, Salim having been unable to maintain his loyalty to his nephew long. The breach occurred in connection with a murder case at Ras-el-Kheima, under the follow ing circumstances :—On 9th May, Shaikh Mahzam-bin-Muhammad, Head man of the Island o'f Zaab, or ' Jeziret-el-Hamra ', near Ras-el-Kheima, was sitting outside the house of a relation at Ras-el-Kheima, in the company of several other residents of the place, when he was attacked by Shaikh Salim's son. Sultan, and mortally stabbed. It was given out at the time, in order to save the feelings of the two families, that the murder was due to the opposition of Shaikh Mahzam to the selection of Sultan's brother, Muham- mad-bin-Salim, as Assistant Governor of the town under his father. But this is not sufficient to account for the deed, and the real cause of it proves to have been that Sultan wanted to obtain in marriage a girl related to Mahzam, and Mahzam opposed the match, on the ground that Sultan was a dissolute character of low birth, and unfit to be the girl's husband. Shaikh Sagar, with the apathy which so marks his character, could not be induced, in spite of the R'esident's urgent advice, to proceed to Ras-el- Kheima himself and effect a settlement calculated to prevent any general disturbance of the peace. Meanwhile the murderer absconded to Bokha on the Musandim promontory, under Maskat; Shaikh Salim,^ the father of the murderer, becoming suspicious of Sagar's aloofness, and in the interests of his son, came to an understanding with the Chief of Bokha with a view to opposing Shaikh Sagar, should he attempt to settle the matter on any terms other than compromise. It must be noted that Mahzam was Shaikh Sagar's father-in-law, so that the latter had a strong domestic interest in the case. All his people being away at the pearl fisheries however, and not caring to proceed to Ras-el-Kheima without sufficient force. Shaikh Sagar found himself in a dilemma and at this stage asked the Residency Agent, (r\o78 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF subject to permission from Mgher authority, to mediate. In the result Shaikh Sagar undertook, mistakenly I think, to leave Salim in charge of Ras- el-Kheima and its dependencies; including Shuam and Manaiyee, but exclud ing Jeziret-el-Hamra, the inhabitants of which island, in view of Mahzam's murder, naturally refused to be controlled by Shaikh Salim. As it is doubt ful whether this arrangement can last, and, as it is injurious to Shaikh Sagar's interests, the Government of India have not yet been asked to recognise Shalikh Salim as independent Chief of Eas-el-Kheima, and the Resident is of opinion that he should not be so recognised for the present. The first difficult question which the Resident had to handle on return Debai. from leave in the spring, was the case of n i • i • • tlie murder or man-slaughter of a native ot JJebai, claiming some measure of British protection, by one of the Shaikh's relatives. The Shaikh had handled it with great ineptitude and it was likely to gam serious proportions. For a proper understanding of the case, some explanation of the antecedent circumstance is necessary. At most of the Gulf ports reside small communities of the Khoia sect Haying originally come from Sind, and having for the most part preserved their distinct type and religion, they have generally been regarded (with the exception of part of the community'at Maskat) as entitled to British protec- twn At Debai, there is a family of this caste, known as the ' Bin Loota's,' who have been on the Trucial Coast for some generations and have gradually, m point of fact, become merged in the community in which they live They have adopted the religion and dress of the Arabs of the Trucial Coast; have inter-married with them and, in appearance, are undistinguishable from them. There is therefore really no obligation on our part to protect them, .or at any rate to protect the next generation, but as the present generation have been treated as British subjects, it is undesirable to withdraw protec tion except for specific misconduct. The present heads of the community are oldish men named Nasir and Ahmed, the sons of Obeid-bin-Loota; not very desirable individuals, who have g^iven some trouble to the Residency in the past m connection with the flying of flags on their dhows and the keep ing oi slaves- For some time past it appeared that there has been ill-feeling between the Bin Lootas and the Shaikh of Debafi and his relations. Recently a petty dispute had occurred, in regard to which a Nakhuda in the Bin Loota s employ had lodged a complaint, and the Bin Lootas asserted that onaikn Butti had treated it lightly and given them no relief. In connection wuth this case, one Rashid, of the Bin Loota clan, assaulted Shaikh Butti- bin-Rashid, the Shaikh of Debai's cousin and Vazier. On hearing of this, all the Bu Felasa (the Shaikh's clan) girded up their loins and prepared to molest any of the Bin Loota family whom they could come across. The first two to meet were Maktoom-bin-Rashid, brother of the assaulted Buttt-bin- Kasnid, and Muhammad-bin-Nasir-bin-Loota : they commenced to spar and tHen to wrestle, then a knife or knives were drawn and Muhammad-bm-Nasir received a wound m the body from which he died 10 days later. The Shaikh made no serious attempt to confine the guilty party who was allowed first to take retuge at the house of one Ahmed-bin-Dalmook and then to escape to Beraimi, where he took sanctuary with the Naim Shaikhs. The Chief's excuse was that the Bin Lootas had refused to hand over their Rashid, for trial, so he a so refused to arrest Maktoom. A few days later he was induced to arrest Maktoom s brother, Manaa, as a hostage for Maktoom's return, but he was, released after a few days. The Residency Agent took up the cause of the Bin Lootas strongly, but as he has a daughter of Nasir-bin-Loota to wire, allowance had to be made for possible domestic pressure. The matter was at this stage when the Resident arrived in the Gulf. It was clearly necessary to take some prompt action to induce the Shaikh to ettect a settlement of the matter, before it assumed larger proportions He was required by letter from Lingah dated 29th March to deposit Rs. 5,000 with the Residency pending settlement of the case and to produce Maktoom in JJebai to answer for his conduct within six weeks. The money was duly aeposited. On the 9th May, the Shaikh and his entourage repaired to the -brmsn Agency at Shargah, and while producing genuine letters from thePOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOE 1910. 79 Nairn Shaikhs of Beraimi, refusing to surrender Maktoom and Mana-bin- Rashid except under certain guarantees, expressed their great regret to the Residency for what had occurred, and asking the Residency Agent to help in mediating an amicable settlement with the Bin Loota family. This the Residency Agent did, and the parties arrived at a written settlement on the 23rd of May. There it was thought best to leave the quarrel; but, though outward peace has been made, it is possible that the 'feud between the families will last for many years to come. After the reconciliation had been effected, the sons of Rashid were by agreement allowed to return to Debai, but the Shaikh, instead of allowing them to enter quietly and treating them with dignified reserve, tactlessly ' dressed ' his flagstaff, informing the Bin Lootas that he was doing it out of gladness at the healing of the quarrel. They, however, not unnaturally, took umbrage at his action as an unnecessary sign of favour towards his guilty kinsmen. Shaikh Butti was made to assure Nasir-bin-Loota, in the Resident's presence, that his action was solely prompted by the sentiments ex plained, to admit that it wa-s thoughtless, and to regret that it should have hurt their feelings. Just before the end of the year, there occurred at Debai another unfortu nate incident which is not likely to be 'forgotten in the present generation. Our blockade of the Mekran Coast, since the beginning of the year, had had the effect of diverting the traffic in arms to other channels. For weeks past, reports had been coming from Maskat that arms were going overland to the Trucial Coast, and being shipped from there to the Persian ports The Shaikhs had been repeatedly warned and had as often denied absolutely that any traffic was going on through their territories. At any rate, no consignments were detected at sea. In view of these reports, however, the Resident asked permission to arrange, after the impending visit of His Excel lency the Naval Commander-in-Chief to Bushire, to proceed to install Mr. New at Debai, as a means of strengthening our position there. On his way up the Gulf, His Excellency posted the Flagship H. M. S. 'Hyacinth^', Captain James Dick, at Debai, to patrol that port and the vicinity with his ship's boats. The Lieutenant in command of the boat posted in the Khor Debai, received information from a negro-slave that some arms were concealed in a certain house. He accordingly went and interviewed the Shaikh and asked b'im to search the house. After some procrastination, the Shaikh complied, but did the business in a perfunctory way which would have given the owners of the arms every chance of getting them away, had they been there. The Lieutenant reported the Shaikh's unsatisfactory conduct to Captain Dick. Meanwhile fresh reports from informers were received by the Flag Captain pointing to the presence of arms in certain houses; and Captain Dick there fore decided to take a party ashore in the morning and get the Shaikh to have the houses searched in his presence. One of the houses belonged to Tham-bin-Khalaf, and the other to one Ahmed Dilmook, a near neighbour and connection by marriage of the Shaikh. Captain Dick instructed his interpreter to send a message to the Shaikh over night to say that he would be on shore in the morning at daylight. It is doubtful if this message ever reached the Shaikh, but in any case it is not possible that 70 men could have landed from the ship's boats in sight and within a few yards of the Shaikh's house, without his knowing of it. Cap tain Dick sent him a message on landing to inform him of his arrival and asking him to hurry up, and aflter waiting some minutes without result, de cided to push on without him. The whole party first proceeded to Thani-bin- Khalaf's house, which was superficially searched without result; then a sus picious looking floor was noted, dug up and three old obsolete rifles unearthed. Captain Dick ait this stage withdrew his seamen and took them off to search the other suspected house, that of Ahmed-bin-Dilmook, leaving Major Heriot and his Marines to finish with Bin Khalaf's house and then return to the shore or rejoin him at the other house. On approaching Bin Dilmook's house. Captain Dick's party was fired on, whereupon a general fusillade seems to have commenced. The Shaikh80 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP only joined Captain Dick just after the firing had begun, and whether or not he had been a party to the inception of the attack, on being called on by the Flag Captain, he seems to have endeavoured to stop it at some risk to him self. Meanwhile Major Heriot's party had made a start to join the Captain, but the firing became so rapid on the beach side that they thought they had better make their way direct there. On arrival they found the boats and a few men under Lieutenant Noakes who had already reached the shore, defend ing themselves against a heavy fire. Major Heriot was able to signal to H. M. S. Hyacinth ' to bombard the town from the north side, and as the result of a few shell and the action of the Shaikh, firing soon ceased, and Captain Dick was ultimately able to assemble his party on the beach and return to the ship, having been on shore about 5 hours. The casualties on our side were 5 killed and 9 wounded, 8 of whom it is believed eventually recovered- The Arabs were said to have lost 37 men. The incident occurred on 24th December. News of it was received at Bushire by the Admiral and the Resident by wireless on X'mas Day, and the Flagship followed on 26th, having left H. M. S. ' Fox ' and other vessels at Debai. His Excellency and the Resident left on 27th as soon as the Flag ship could proceed and only learned the details of what had occurred, on the way down. On arrival at Debai, it was reported that many oif the inhabitants, expect ing reprisals, had fled to the hinterland, and that the town generally was in a state of imminent fear. The British Indian Banians alleged that the inhabitants were depending for immunity on their presence and would not let them leave, but on the contrary had warned them that if any firing were commenced by His Majesty's Ships, they would at once be murdered. The Shaikh naturally feared to come off to the Flagship without a written assurance that he would be allowed to return in safety, but having received this in writing, he forthwith came on board with the Residency Agent and his cousin, Butti-bin-Rashid. Meanwhile the evidence of the several officers concerned appeared to indicate that either from apathy or intention, the Shaikh had not taken the trouble to prevent the attack, but that, when he saw how far it had gone, and when specifically called on to do so by the Flag Captain, he had done his best to stop the firing and had shown himself able to do so. In fact it was clear that, but for his eventual assistance, the losses to our party would have been much heavier, if indeed they had not been annihilated. In his interview with the Commander-in-Chief and the Resident, how ever, the Shaikh adopted an uncompromising attitude, alleging that no mes sage had reached him from the Flag Captain, that he had heard nothing of the landing party until it was ashore, and that by the time he had dressed and hurried out, the mischief had commenced; and lastly that the firing had been started by our men. It appeared to His Excellency and the Resident essential that the matter should be disposed of without the delay which a reference to Government would have involved, having regard to the precarious means of communication existing, and the uncertain state of the weather ; the following demands were accordingly made upon the Shaikh, to be complied with in 48 hours :— (i) The replacement of a tide-pole which had been removed; (ii) The acceptance of a telegraph installation at any time required by Government, in accordance with treaty obligations; (Hi) The surrender of 400 rifles to be collected from the townsmen; (iv) The payment of a fine of 50,000 rupees. Shaikh Butti was informed that the restoration or retention of the 50,000 rupees in whole or parfc, would be contingent on his agreeing to accept, when required, two further requirements— (i) the location of a British officer as Agent of the Government of India, (ii) the acceptance of the change in the unsatisfactory local postal arrangements at present in force to a proper post office on the lines of those employed at other places of steamer-call in the Gulf.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 81 The four primary conditions were complied with in the time allowed; as regards the others, the Shaikh replied that he had no other alternative but to accept them, but urged that they were measures which would make things very difficult for him. The Government of India, on learning the details of what had transpired, were unable to approve of all the terms which it had been sought to impose and preferred to leave the question of the Post Office and the British Agent in abeyance until the general effect of the recent incident had been fully gauged, and the situation had returned to normal. They decided in fact to consider the recent Incident terminated for the present by the Shaikh's com pliance with the first four conditions required of him. P. Z.

The relations between the Political Agent and the Chief were very Political. friendly throughout the year. The .Chief event of importance was that the Shaikh agreed to build, at his own expense, a pier in Manama for the landing of cargo from the steamers at all tides. The idea is still in the preliminary stage. The authorities of Hasa again sent soldiers to Zakhnuniyah during the year, and it became necessary to remind the Porte of past promises with the result that the soldiers were withdrawn. Almas, Negro, the Confidential Adviser of Shaikh Isa, died on 11th January, and was replaced by Ali-bin-AbdulIa. On the advice of Ali-bin-Abdullah, Shaikh Isa called upon house owners to produce the sanads in virtue of which they held their property. On their failing to do so they were evicted and no consideration was paid to the period of possession. Shaikh Mukbil-bin-Abdur Rahman adh Dhakair protested to Shaikh Isa against this measure as it pressed hardly on the poor. The protest had the desired effect, and the Shaikh promised to refrain from such actions in future. The 23rd of May was observed as a day of mourning in Bahrain for the death of His Most Gracious Majesty King Edward VII. The bazaars were closed, and the Political Agent received visits of condolence from Shaikh Isa and his sons as well as from the leading members of the different communities in Bahrain. On 21st July Captain Dodington, R.N., of His Majesty's Ship 'Red breast,' accompanied by the Political Agent, visited Shaikh Isa and the latter, accompanied by his sons, returned the Commander's visit on board His Majesty's Ship ' Redbreast.' As he left the ship a salute of 11 guns was fired in honour of the Shaikh. This was the first time that Shaikh Isa received the enhanced salute which was conferred upon him last year by the Government of India. On the receipt of reliable information the house of a leading merchant of Muharraq, Yusuf-bin-Abdur Rahman Fakro, was successfully searched for arms and ammunition, on 2nd August 1910, by the Political Agent with the consent of Shaikh Isa and a number of rifles, revolvers with much ammunition were confiscated. Yusuf Fakro was fined Rs. 4,000 which was paid to Shaikh Isa, and the arms and ammunition were thrown into the sea. Simultaneously with this search, the premises of some foreigners, sus pected of dealing in arms, were successfully searched and the guilty men fined. Mr. K. Wram, a Russian trader from Maskat, established his business in Bahrain in February. When arms seizures were made, it transpired that he was smuggling arms and ammunition into Bahrain and reliable evidence was collected to this effect. He happened to be absent in Maskat at the time and, to prevent his return here. Shaikh Isa wrote to the Political Agent requesting that steps might be taken to prevent his landing in Bahrain should he arrive by steamer. The necessary steps were accordingly taken, but Mr. Wram made no attempt to return.ADMN. REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOB 1910.

During the year under report one thousand and two civil cases and three Mm jfr •'.» ; tr ad ic:- %i*v hundred and sixty-four criminal cases Judicial - have been disposed of. The decrease in the number of civil cases is due to the fact that the. year has been a prosperous one and the Nakhudas have made good profits on pearls. As in last year, cases between Nakhudas and Divers have been tried by the S&amp;lifa' Judge in the presence of a representative from the Agenov. Where the Nakhuda cannot give a proper explanation of his accounts, the matter is referred to the Head Qazi Shaikh Qasim-bin-Mahza and the oath is administered. ' ' Much credit is due to the Head Qazi for his management of these diffi cult and delicate cases and' he seems to be a great power for good and to do his beSt ! W cjbtain-a faiT hearing for the divers. There does not seem to_be much chance of a real improvement in the settlement of these cases, unless the Nakhudas themselves can be induced to see that their own profits will be as sured by a just and more lenient system. At present, their accounts are closed yearly and they resent bitterly the examination of any accounts except those of the year in which the case is instittiteu. Another very important matter, without which no progress can be made, is tte codification of the 'Urf or customary law which governs the^e cases. Uhtil we know What it actuallr is, it is impossible to amend it, so as to bring it more iJto line' with the requirements of civilization. There are two grievous complaints against the Nakhudas— tt) that they work slaves and that, if the slaves are given manumission W papers, these avail them nothing as they are promptly rrturned fn a state of slavery by the heavy claims brought against them on accomf of 'S of which 'claims no examination is pos sible and which, most probably, contain items sueii as the pm- chase of the slave himself, the purchase of^a wife for him, the exoenfees of his bringing up in his master, s house, perhaps from earlv childhood, etc. Against these items there is no setoff, such as an equitable assessment of the wages due to him for his work n 284 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF or to put it in another way, the profits of his master during the slave's slavery. The non-examination of past years' accounts prevents an equitable settlement of this kind. (2) that the system of the ' Urf ' reduces free men to a condition of slavery. The question will require patient and delicate handling. The only method that promises success would be to induce the Nakhudas themselves to lay down, in council, the rules governing the ' Urf,' and gradually to relax some of the severer regulations which press so hardly in particular cases. In spite of all that is said against the Nakhudas, there is one great fact which stands out in'their defence. This is that there is never any lack of applicants for service in the pearling boats. It is hard to explain why they flock to the pearls in this way in spite of the well-known hardships of this service, but it would seem to be on the same principle that people in more civilised countries put money into lotteries. One man in 10,000 draws a prize, and so does one diver among many. The general health of the public was very good, and there was no out break of any infectious disease in an Public health. epidemic form. The Victoria Memorial Hospital continues to be popular with all castes and communities. The buildings were ready about the end of April. The Quarantine camp began to be used from about the 15th Quarantine. April. Regulations are observed and appear to excite no hostility. The year under report has been a prosperous one for the people of Bah- rain. The price of pearls has risen dur- Generai. ing the year 30 to 50 per cent, over the ■already good prices of last year. The date crop also was better than last year, which was a boon especially to the poorer classes. About Rs.12,000 was subscribed by the Arabs of Bahrain towards the im_ provement of the Ottoman navy. Shaikh Qasim-bin-Muhammad A1 Thani of Qatar subscribed Rs. 2,000. In June, Shaikh Isa transferred the collection of export duty on shells, hides and shark fins to his Customs om- Customs. cials Messrs. Gangaram Tikamdas &amp; Co. Shaikh Isa-bin-Ali-Al-Khalifa appointed Mr. Wills of Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. as his cargo landing Agent from 5th October, subject to three months' trial. This honest attempt to remedy a grave defect in the Customs administra tion has met with little success and is now threatened with failure. It was unfortunately a foregone conclusion that the ruler of Bahrain would do his best to upset the scheme, but it is still more disappointing to have to record that it has been attacked by British subjects and foreign merchants under British protection. No complaints reached the Agency, nor so far as can be ascertained, did any complaints worthy of serious consideration reach the Agent Mr Wills, until two and a half months had elapsed when three peti tions, signed by the representatives of the various commercial communities, reached the Political Agent and the Shaikh of Bahrain. The Political Agent understands from the head of the Bunniahs com munity that they got their petition ready at the start of affairs and withheld it until the close of the appointed period. Their attitude is typical ot the other communities. They were determined to give the Agent no chance oi remedying any unpopular features of the new scheme. The serious illness of Mr. Wills may have had much to do with this hos tility, but the petitions, though probably unconsciously, are directed against Shaikh Isa's past and present neglect of his obligations and not against anypolitical residency for 1910. 85 real fault of the present management during which all claims were promptly met and in most cases paid. It may be as well to note that Mr. Wills and the firm he represents neither made, nor expected to make, a farthing in return for his exertions during the three months' management. Shaikh Jabar-bin-Muhammad-al-Khalifa, cousin of the Chief of Bah rain, died on the 1st June. The killing of a greyhound of Shaikh Ibrahim-bin-Khalid-al-Khalifa by Shaikh Hamud-bin-Subah-al-Khalifa Family affairs of the ruler ef Bairam. has oaused bad blood between the latter and Shaikh Khalid-bin-Ali-al-Khalifa. Haji Ahmed Bahraini of Jazirat, contractor of date gardens of Shaikh Ibrahim-bin-Khalid-al-Khalifa, fled with his whole family to Qatif on ac count of his having suffered loss over the date gardens. Shaikh Khalid sent a boat to Qatif and Shaikh Hamad-bin-Isa wrote a letter to Mansur-bin- Juma Pasha's brother, Abdul Husein, to induce the man to return but he re fused to do so. Shaikhs Hamad, Muhammad, and Abdullah, sons of the Chief of Bah rain, contracted fresh marriages during the year. Shaikh Salman-bin-Hamad-bin-Isa-al-Khalifa, aged about 20 years, was married to his cousin, the daughter of Shaikh Ibrahim-bin -Khalid-al-Khalifa. Shaikh Khalifa-bin-Salman-al-Khalif a proceeded to Mecca on a pilgrim- Shaikhs Said and Juma, sons of the late Shaikh Maktoom of Debai, visited Bahrain during the year.

Consequent on the reduction of the Agency Guard to 19 Non-Commis- sioned Officers and men, 1 Native Officer and 10 Non-Commissioned Officers and men left for Jask, on 24:th November, to fejom their regiment. The spring rains terminated on 13th May and totalled 1-76 inches.

During November and December rain fell ten times, total quantity 2-26 inches or 1-58 inches less than the amount for the corresponding period last year. No one rainfall was heavier than 49 inch. The summer of 1910 was cooler than the previous year. The thermo meter rose above 100° eight times between'May 28th and August 8th, the high est readme being on 17th July, 102-3 0 .

They were unsuccessfully pursued by Shaikh Qasim's men; ' Shaikh Qasim then reported the incident to Hajkjkey ]Beg, Commander of the Hasa Garrison, with the result that the latter tracked the Bedouin rob bers, recovered the five camels and restored them to Shaikh Qasim. The people of Bu Kuwara and Dhain villages of Qatar are dissatisfied with Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Qasini-al-Thani on account of latter's oppressive taxation on boats.

In July., &amp; fight occurred between the inhabitants of Fariq-al-Siasib and Fariq-al-Ayuni in .Mubarraz over the arrest of the murderer of one of the Siasib wen some two years ago. One of the Siasib and two of the Ayuni people were killed. In the. same month, Saud, one of the.two principal men of the A1 Mohanna section of the Ayun, caused his rival Salih, who was chosen headman by the tril)^ to be shot by his fidawl and took refuge with the Al c Audah section. Thereupon a fight occurred between j the two tribal sections, the casualties being 11 men of A1 Mohanna and 6 of the A1 Audah killed. Later on the deceased's son, with the assistance of his tribe, arrested the murderer. On hearing this, Saud started to kill 'SaUh's son, but the latter's tribe rose m a body and beseiged Saud in a fort and the Mutesarrif of Hasa subsequently arresfted and imprisoned him. Two caravans were attacked during the year on the Hasa-Ojair caravan route, and goods, worth. 2,000 rials were carried off by the Bedouins. u In ^ugust, the post from Ojair to Hasa was robbed by the Bedouin of Bani llajir and A1 Morra.

From all the Political Agent has been able to learn from other Hindu traders he has done Well, and is perfectly satisfied with the treatment he has received at the hands of the Turkish Authorities. In September, Saud-bin-Abdul Aziz-al-Araif and his brother, who have rebelled against Bin Saud, took possession of Hariq, entered the district of Kharaj and turned Bin Baud's men out of it. Bin Saud soon started after his relations and turned them out of Hariq. The latter then went to Hotah, but the inhabitants did not allow them to enter for fear of Bin Saud. They then entered Saib taking with them some Hazazinah but Bin Saud's Governor Saib attacked them, killed 25 Hazazinah and turned out the A1 Araif. Lastly, the A1 Araif tried to enter Slayal but the people of that town refused to allow them to do so and they are now said to have dispersed, some have gone to Mecca and others to Hasa and Qatar. In September, the Sharif of Mecca with his forces invaded the province of Qasim chiefly with a view to settling once for all the question of jurisdic tion over the said province. The Sharif's first action, adfter arriving at Qasim, was to imprison Sad- bin-Abdur Rahman, brother of Bin Saud, as well as the Shaikh of the Ataiba Bedouin who is a friend of Bin Saud and resides in Qasim. On receipt of this intelligence, Bin Saud at once marched with a strong force to meet Sharif. The Sharif and Bin Saud, after an exchange of views, came to an amicable settlement over Qasim and, according to the Egyptian paper ' A1 Manar,' the following are the terms of settlement:— (1) The Ataiba are not to be interfered with in any way whatever whether when settled or on the march, and no dikat will be levied from them nor will there be any interference on the plea of Khalifa, i .e., Chieftainship. (2) Baj (tax of dollars 2 per camel) will not be levied from them, in any form whatever, on account of any village they may have built. If they do anything wrong, report should be made to the Sharif. (3) Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud will obey the Sharif of Mecca in all that he may order in accordance with the rights and benefits of the Turkish Government. (4) Qasim, i .e., Buraida and other towns, is left at the disposal of its inhabitants. If they choose Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud, the writer of this agreement, they may remain at his orders and pay 3,000 Majidis to the Government Treasury at Mecca yearly. If no communication (mathbata) is received from them, then an Amir will be appointed over them with their approval. But the said tax will have to be paid in any case. The mathbata will be awaited until the end of Shawwal 1328. A caravan of 500 camels, consisting of wool and ghee, on its way from Najd to Hasa, was unsuccessfully attacked by the Al-Arjah section of the Ajman tribe.

Climate and Rainfall.-—The year 1910 fulfilled the better climatic conditions anticipated in last year's General * report, for the summer was comparatively milder, the highest maximum shade temperature registered being 114° for the 23rd August as against 116-9 0 for the 31st July 1909, and good rain also fell, more than 9^ inches being registered at the Agency Observatory; conse quently, with an abundant supply of fodder in the desert the Bedouin were able to make up the heavy losses they suffered during the previous two years' drought. Latest arrivals from the interior report fair rainfall throughout, and the present season is expected to be favourable. An extract prepared from the Agency &lt;iaily Meteorological reports is attached. Local A ffairs. —Much dissatisfaction and discontent has Been preva lent during the year owing to the continued heavy exactions of Shaikh Mubarak to finance his raids against desert offenders. Though the people have suffered heavily pecuniarily and trade has to some extent been hampered, no concerted action by the leading men of the place seems to be possible against the Shaikh's iron will and a half-hearted attempt made by some leading pearl- merchants to represent their grievances only lead to their burdens being increased. In January, the Shaikh imprisoned 15 petty shopkeepers for discussing religious points with more heat than discretion and fined them $110 apiece. There have been no murders or dacoities in the town and law and order are well maintained. Exchange. —The Maria Theresa dollar which used to fluctuate so much was fixed by the Shaikh at 85 Indiaa pice per dollar, a rate of exchange equivalent to Its. 132:8125 to $100. (Dn the dollar becoming scarce and the exchange rising above this equivalent, it would appear at first sight thereiore to be to the shroff's advantage to disburse copper ^t the fixed rate, but it is iust at this stage that a shorjtage of copper occurs. The only possible reason seems to be that the shroffs are afraid of the public seizing the opportunity to exchange the two silver coins through the medium of copper, and, theretore, to keep up the delusion of a shortage of copper, they also discount the rupee, thus creating an artificial exchange between the rupee and its own fractional money The difficulty is due to there being no small change for either the dollar or the rupee except Indian copper pice, and to the Shaikh s well-meant attempt to fix its relation to the dollar (the real Kuwait currency) m order to simplify petty transactions and prevent fraud on the poor. General ignorance and persistent preference for the dollar currency militate against the establishment of an equitable and stable exchange, ine Political Agent imported copper pice to avoid loss to Government servants, though probably there are ample stores of copper locked up by the shrofls. The matter is one which it may be possible to take up later when the rupee comes to be in more general favour. Death of His Britannic Majesty 17/.—The sad news of the demise of His Majesty the King-Emperor, Edward VII, wa s received on the 9th May ; the Agency and the Shaikh's flags were at once half masted and condolence visits by the Shaikh and other leading men of Kuwait paid to the Political Agent. , ■ .

He was accompanied by two of his relatives, Abdul Aziz-bin-Missa'ad-al-Jaloi and Abdul Aziz-bin-Turki. The 'Bin Saud' family, who were -all very pleasant, together with Shaikh Mubarak and his soil, Hamad, dined with the Political Agent, it being the first occasion on which these members of the ruling Wahabi house had met a European. Shaikh Mubarak gave to Bin Saud and his party presents said to be worth some $20,000. The object of Bin Sand's visit was to Clear up some misunderstanding between. Shaikh Mubarak and himself, for a report had reached him that Shaikh Mubarak believed that several raids, committed by the Ajman tribes men during the previous year, had Bin Saud's approval. Ajman Shaikh's visit. —-A few days before Bin Saud's arrival 16 Shaikhs of the Aj mail tribe arrived in Kuwait, the chief of them being the late Muhammad-bin-Hithlain and Ma'ana-bin-Juma. They were sent in by Bin Saud to make their peace with Shaikh Mubarak and offer their services for his raid against the Thaffir and Muntafik. Shaikhs from Hail. —On the 7th November Faisal-bin-Hamud-ul-Obeid- ar-Rashid arrived in Kuwait from El Hasa and, on 2nd December, was followed by Shaikh Thari, his elder brother, from Maskat. These two Shaikhs, with whom the Political Agent exchanged visits, have remained in Kuwait to the date of this report, and appear to have spent the last three years begging other chiefs to assist them in some intrigue to oust the present ruler of Hail and Jebel Shammar but without obtaining much encourage ment. Bahrain Shaikhs. —Shaikhs Muhammad-bin-Esa-al-Khalifa, second son of the Shaikh of Bahrain, visited Kuwait, in December, for hawking in the desert, returning to Bahrain after a stay of about a fortnight- A large number of Bedouin Shaikhs have visited the Political Agent during the year, the more notable among them being Fahad-bin-Hithlain, the present chief Shaikh of the A]man tribe with Thaidan, his Wazir and Ma'ana-bin-Juma; Eaisal-bin-Sultan-ud-Dowish, Shaikh of the Untair toge ther with a number of the minor Umtair Shaikhs, Shaikh Muhammad as Sagh-bin-Fahad of the A1 Morrah, and several others. Affairs in Najd were much disturbed in the early part of the year with many disquieting reports of raids and Najd Affairs. fighting, but, towards the end, a truce between Bin Saud and Ibn Rashid has done much to restorp order, and cara vans are now moving confidently into the interior. Ibn Rashid's Raids.—In March, Ibn Rashid was reported as having successfully raided the Anaiza in the Faiylan valley to the north-east of Hail near Jamaimujah, after three days' continuous fighting in which there were 500 casualties and the Anaiza lost all their belongings, some 2,000 tents and 70 slaves. Ibn Rashid had on his side the Ataiba, two sections of the Umtair and the Shammar and was opposed by all the Anaiza led by Shaikh Nun-bm- Sha'alan of the Rowalah. In Mav, a report came in that Ibn Rashid had raided successfully on the west of Bin Sand's country; that he had reached Shibermah three or j^r days south of Boraida, and seized Bin Sands bait-aJ-Mal (treasnry) there and returned to Hail leaving letters to the people of Kasim that he wat, now their over-lord as Bin Sand had deserted them and their well-being for Mubarak-as -Subah. These letters were forwarded to Bin Saud to Jahara and, on their receipt, he left for Riadh Bta A1 Awama wells. Reports were also received of minor raids with various results on the Harb (Ben it^ui!^ has 1)66,1 on th6 wan6 since th6 Rowalah Anka f®ok Jauf-al-Amir in 1909. . , , .. . , ' The A rait —One of the most disturbing factors in Najd politics has X.

There are nine of these young men who, starting with no following at all, seized the opportunity of Bin Saud's absence at Kuwait to collect all discontented Arabs in Southern Najd and set up their own authority in A1 Harij. They had before this taken refuge at Furgaija in A1 Hassa and through Shaikh Mubarak's good offices three of them at least were reconciled to Bin Sand. The reconciliation appears to have been insin cere for, within a month, fresh intrigues were set on foot. Finally, in early November, Bin Saud marched against them in A1 Harij and utterly defeated them, killing some 150 of their men, razing their new fort at Harij to the fround and doubling the contributions in men and money formerly furnished y the people of the district. The ' A1 Araif ' fled, some to Qatif, some to Mecca and others to Oman. The power for evil of these pretenders should be broken now for some considerable time to come. Bin Saud's Raids. —In July a messenger brought news that Bin Saud had raided the A1 Hamadan and Bin Darwish sections of the Umtair tribe, and some of the Shammar tribe with them and had taken from them as much as 4,000 camels in loot. The raid took place in the vicinity of the Athain Nakhal wells in Ibn Rashid's territory and half way between Boraida and Hail. During the last week of August a report reached Kuwait that the Beni Thamin inhabitants of El Houtha village had conspired with the people of El Harij (probably under instructions from the A1 Araif) to murder the headmen in charge of Bin Saud's fort in El Harij. An attempted ruse and surprise were suspected with the result that the four leading conspirators lost their heads, while some 80 of the villagers were killed before the fort was captured. Rin Saud and the Sharif of Mecca. —One of the noteworthy events of the year was the excursion made by the Sharif of Mecca into Najd and its affairs. The Sharif appears to have left Taif on his own responsibility with some 300 followers and the horsemen of the Ateyba tribe as escort. He sent letters asking for provisions, money, etc., to Shaikh Mubarak, the Sultan of Maskat, and most other Arab Chiefs and gave out that his object was to re assert the Sharif's authority over the Kasim province, an authority which has been in abeyance since the days of Ibrahim Pasha's Egyptian expedition into Arabia. Counting on the perennial feud between Bin Saud and~ Ibn Rashid, he asked the latter to aid him ^ith fighting men in his advance on Riadh. The Sharif reached Duadami in Southern Kasim before he realized that no support would be forthcoming from Hail owing to the recently concluded peace between the rival chiefs of Central Arabia. At the same time Bin Saud arrived within two days' march of his camp with a large force, news of which immediately caused the Sharif's Bedouin following to melt away. The Sharif having one of Bin Saud's brothers in his power made the best of a bad business by sending Bin Saud a conciliatory letter, explaining he had not come in war but to ascertain the truth or falsity of reports current in Mecca as to Bin Saud's government. Bin Saud replied with'munificent presents and the Sharif then made use of Bin Saud's anxiety for his brother to extract a document to the effect that $6,000 of the Kasim revenue should be paid by Bin Saud to the Sharif, that Bin Saud should leave the Ateyba triBe in peace, referring complaints against them to the Sharif, and that he should always assist the Turkish Government to the best of his power if men should be required for the Turkish army. Bin Saud probably has no intention of keeping these terms, and the Sharif has no power to enforce them without Turkish assistance. No meeting actually took place between them, and the Sharif then return ed to Mecca, after which fulsome reports began to appear in the Egyptian Arabic papers as to Bin Saud's loyalty. As a result of a good season, wh^h made fodder abundant and water less scarce in the desert, raids and coun- Tribai Politics. ter-raids have been rather more fre quent than was the case last year. Saud-bin-Lami, Shaikh of the Jiblan Umtair, who was mentioned as wanted by Shaikh Mubarak in last year's report, was at last caught napping■jyaesst-: POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 93 and looted of all he possessed, himself barely escaping with his life. The proceeds of this raid by Mubarak's men fetched $4,000 at an auction in Kuwait. Ajman Tribe. —In April, the news of the murder of the Chief Shaikh of the Ajman, Muhammad-bin-Hithlain reached Kuwait. He was shot in revenge by a woman, whose father, Shabib-bin-Hithlain, Muhammad had himself killed some four years before. The incident is almost without pre cedent among the Bedouin, and the necessary blood-money was arranged through Shaikh Mubarak. Soon after this event a compromise was arranged by Shaikh Mubarak for the Shaikhship of the Ajman. Fahad, elder brother of the murdered Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, becoming the titular Shaikh with Thaidan-al-Hith- lain as his wazir and executive representative. All matters of importance were to be decided by a triumvirate of the Hithlain family consisting of the above two and Badah-bin-Asgah-al-Hithlain. The arrangement, as might have been anticipated, has resolved itself into Fahad taking his ease, while young Thaidan practically controls the tribe as he wishes. Al-hu-Ainam.—hi last year's report the settlement of the Al-bu- Ainain tribe at Qasar-as-Subaih was noted. The headmen came to Kuwait, in March, to seek Shaikh Mubarak's support. He treated them with the usual Arab hospitality and sent them away with presents, telling them that he had no objection to their settlement provided it did not lead to future trouble. Mubarak claims the ground to be within his territory and the reported visits of Turkish soldiers from Qatif or A1 Hasa to the spot do not meet with his approval. The Al-bu-Ainain are reported to have built houses and some kind of fort during the year. They have lived peaceably and visited the pearl banks. Muharak-Sadun Campaign. —The most important matter during the year has been the defeat of Mubarak's and Bin Saud's combined forces by Shaikh Sadun of the Muntafik assisted by the Thaffir. The genesis of the affair was an unprovoked raid by some Thaffir tribesmen on a small caravan of sheep in the vicinity of A1 Hafar, belonging to a Najdi merchant of Kuwait. This incident was aggravated by anothter raid, of Th ^ fik eombined, on the camels of some Kuwait Araibdar in A1 J^arak wrote to the offending chiefs to make restitution of the looted property in accordance with Bedouin desert law, for up to this time there was peace be tween Bin Subah and the Thaffir and Muntafik tribes. It hanpened that at the time Mubarak was collecting a force to punish the Ajman for their raids on Kuwait property during 1909. This expedition however was rendered unnecessary by the fact that all ^ ^ under pressure from Bin Saud, came in and offered their services to Mubar . Tn resnonse to Mubarak's letters Sadun returned a number of the looted camels but refused to send in two of the Thaffir Shaikhs or to induce them to return the looted sheep and camels and, thou g h ^ u ^ a ^ h P ^ te c ^ that he had no quarrel with Sadun, the latter espoused the Ihaftr cause. With Bin Saud present in Kuwait and a large f ^aud was too good to be lost, and the combined.forces ^er Bm Saud and Shaikh Tabir Mubarak's son then marched against the Thaffir and badun. y94 ADMINiSTRATlON REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF discontent at the Shaikh's exactions, and there is no doubt that a very large amount of Kuwait capital has been destroyed in these preparations. The force was kept out in the desert all through the hot weather and winter, their upkeep being a constant drain on the merchants' pockets. Moreover, the fitting out twice over of this force had absorbed all local stocks of camel equipment, arms and clothes with the result that prices rose quite 20 to 30 per cent. It was estimated that, apart from the initial cost of fitting out, the force was costing the Kuwait public some $60,000 a month in wages and food. However, the force justified its existence by a raid, in the last week of September, when it captured some 5,000 Thaffir camels when watering near Chabda and Shagra, west-north-west from Sanam Hill, without suffi cient guards. On the return of the force to Jahara as a sop to his pearl merchants who were becoming restless under the heavy expenditure imposed on them, the Shaikh disbanded mOst of the force, but shortly afterwards again raised his standing army, which remained under arms in the desert under his sons until the close'of the year. In January of this year, however Sadun made overtures for peace which were accepted with conditions, and it is hoped that the matter will soon be finally concluded. In August Shaikh Mubarak gave one of his daughters in marriage to ,, his nephew Saud-bin-Muhammad-bin- bnaikh Mubarak s Attalrs. oil • -n i !Subah, and the union will no doubt help to heal the breach between Shaikh Mubarak and the family of the murdered Muhammad-bin-Subah. The Shaikh has erected a new set of three rooms on the west side of, and in the same style of Basrah brick as his present palace, the labour for the work being imported from Baghdad. Shaikh Mubarak's relations with the Ottoman authorities, at the Shaikh Mubarak's Foreign Relations. begmning of the year Were Unusually intimate, several meetings with Wall Suleiman Nathif Bey taking place, during which various wild schemes were proposed. In March, Shaikh Mubarak placed the services of his Secretary, Abdul Aziz-bin-Salim-bin-Badr, at the disposal of the Wali to arrange at Maskat for a supply of stones required by the Wali for the laudable, purpose of metalling a road from Basrah to Zubair. As the Wali failed to provide the necessary money the scheme fell through after the road had been aligned. ■ The Basrah authorities have frequently attempted to induce the Shaikh both by pressure and the hope of rewards to take out Turkish Nation ality papers, but this the Shaikh has hitherto declined to do and his Fadaghia property consequently remains unregistered. In October the Basrah authorities threatened to station Turkish soldiers at Fadaghia so as to impound the produce, but this never actually took place. Shaikh's relations with Mohammerah. —The Shaikh's friendship with Shaikh Khazal has continued as close as heretofore. He has paid frequent visits to Shaikh Khazal often staying with 'him for several days. In February, the Shaikh stayed at Fallahiyah for over a week having placed himself in the hands of Shaikh Khazal's doctor, Dr. Francis, for treat ment. He also brought Dr. Francis to Kuwait for some days to continue the treatment which is for diabetes. Shaikh's relations with the American Missionary. —The American Mission have established a branch on a permanent footing in Kuwait during the year. Early in January the Shaikh met Dr. Bennett of the Mission at Fallahiyah and invited him to Kuwait. Shortly after he arrived with two other Missionary friends and, having leased a house from the Shaikh, in March, opened a medical dispensary. Dr. Bennett, having come at the Shaikh's invitation, and dispensing free medicines soon acquired a large practice.POLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 95 In August the Mission opened a Bible shop in the bazaar with a Bagh- dadi Christian colporteur in charge. In November, Dr. Bennett obtained by purchase from the Shaikh a plot of ground measuring about 1J acres on which the Mission propose to erect a hospital for in-door patients and dwelling-houses. The plot is situated to the west of the town close to the seashore, and is one of the best sites in Kuwait. The Missionaries have held small religious meetings in private houses, usually attended by a few Baghdadi Christians, but have not jet com menced active proselytism. The public health of Kuwait has been Public Health. on the whole gQod The Agency Uispemctry was oppn throughout the year and the total num ber of patients treated,; during the 11 months (January to November), amount ed to 3,745, averaging a daily attendance of 34-62 as against 50-56 last year. Of the 3,745 patients, 2,729 were men and 1,016 women and children. The chief reason for this falling off is the advent of the American Mission Dispen sary which also affords free treatment. Only 35 vaccinations were performed during the year, of which 25 proved successful and the results of the rest are unknown. The dispensary was rebuilt during the year at a cost of some Rs. 3,500 which sum includes quarters for the Assistant Surgeon. Quarantine. —No regular quarantine has yet been established m Kuwait, though the Shaikh has consented to fairly effective measures m that direction. In April, when Bushire was plague-infected, passengers were detained in lame boats to undergo tt^e quarantine period, and when Maskat Muham- merah and Basrah were chplera-infected, the passengers on the mail steamers were released after medical inspection as. the steamer generally reached Ku wait on the expiry of the necessary period. It is, however, almost impossible to keep any check over native boats. The Shaikh's Customs continue to be managed by Abdul Mehsm, the Shaikh's landing contractor. His „ AJ ... management seems satisfactory and no Customs Administration. complaints have reached the Agency. Relations between the Customs and the local Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company have continued to be friendly and conu.iatory. Lighters have been promptly supplied in large nuired In this respect it is a fact that Kuwait is considerably ahead of othu ports in the Gulf. A few small rooms have been added to the existing Cus toms building during the year for the storage of loose grains. ^ The following ships of His Majesty s Naval and Marine.

Shaikh Mubarak then caused secret enquiries to be made and despatched men in all directions to find the bodies of the victims, but none of these were ever washed up,. On the 18th August, two of the pirates were arrested in Kuwait. One of them on being promised pardon, turned informer and gave the details, and the other was the Nakhuda of the helium. All the pirates belonged to villages near Dowasir on the Shatt-el-Arab and took refuge on the Turkish side, though subjects of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. Endeavours have been made to lay them by the heels but without success, though their names are known. In the meantime the two pirates arrested remain in prison in Kuwait. Another piratical raid was committed, in September, by Bani Hajir Bedouin in three large boats in the vicinity of the Hazaim near Ras Khafji, and 160 Awazim sheep were looted. The raiders were headed by one Mehsin ibn Athan from Bahrain. Endeavours have been made to punish the leader through the Shaikh of Bahrain but so far without success. Owing to the vigilance of the British men-of-war in the Gulf of Oman Arms Traffic. an( ^ ^^kh's own orders prohibiting Kuwait boats from loading arms, the import into Kuwait has practically stopped. The news of the capture of a dhow at Khor Fukhan with firearms to the value of Rs. 20,000 and of the capture and return to Maskat of the late Haji Muhammad Taqi's boom, which was coming to Kuwait with arms, had an ex cellent effect on the minds of the arms dealers in Kuwait. On the 10th of March Mons. Vram from Maskat landed from the British India slow mail ' Bulimba' to see some of his Najdi creditors. From the same steamer, one Haji Muhammad Hussein, son-in-law of the late Haji Muhammad Taqi, succeeded in smuggling 30 Mauser pistols and 10 rifles and ammunition concealed in his and his friends' personal luggage into boats, but the matter was brought to the Shaikh's notice and he confiscated the weapons but subsequently released them on payment of double import duty. At about the same time 170 rifles were found hidden in a buggalow, the property of Nasir (Shaikh Mubarak's blind son), which came from Maskat. These were also confiscated and subsequently released on payment of double import duty. These rifles belonged to Ewaz-bin-Muhammad, another son-in- law of the late Haji Muhammad Taqi. In May a Maskat Samhook belonging to Goguyer et Cie, and flying the French flag brought and landed in Kuwait 301 Gras carbines and 25 cases ammunition for Abdulla-bin-Muhammad-ul-Atiji. The matter was brought to the Shaikh's notice by the Political Agent and, after some difficulty, the consignment was confiscated under the Shaikh's orders from Abdulla-bin- Muhammad-ul-Atiji's house and brought over to the Agency. Subsequently, the Shaikh preferred to have it in his own custody, and it was finally deposited in one of his godowns under seal, the Shaikh agreeing not to remove the arms without the British Government's sanction. The confiscation of the arms from Atiji's house caused much consternation and gossip, and had a most ex cellent effect in' checking the trade. Mons. Nichan Hormaszian, a Maskat arms merchant, arrived in Kuwait, on the 19th May. It was reported that he had also smuggled some rifles and revolvers hidden in his luggage but had paid the Shaikh his Cus toms dues. His visit was to collect outstandings for his firm. On the 2nd of June, Mons. Albert Lagasse, another arms dealer in Maskat, arrived with a letter of introduction from the Political Agent at Maskat. His visit was also to collect outstandings due to his firm, Messrs. Baijeot et Cie. He left for Maskat on the 16th June having recovered some Rs. 10,000, Monsieur Nichan also travelling by the same steamer. On the 9th of June Mons. Elbaz aliaz Ebrahim of the firm of Goguyer et Cie arrived with an Arab broker. He came to treat with the Shaikh aboutPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOR 1910. 97 the 301 Gras weapons confiscated from Abdullah-bin-Muhammad-al-Atij i but without success. He left for Maskat, on the 30th June, taking with him Rs. 15,000 realized from his debtors. While Mons. Elbaz was in Kuwait a Kuwait buggalow returned from India via Maskat. There were rumours in the bazaar that this vessel had brought 3,000 rifles and ammunition from Goguyer's firm and had landed them during 'the night far away from the Cus toms house. The Shaikh denied the rumour and other enquiries failed to substantiate it. In October, Muhammad Dadallah, a Persian firearms dealer of Kuwait, tried to smuggle 21 Mauser rifles by a mail steamer. The rifles were handed over to Muhammad Dadallah's servant at Maskat by Mons. Nichan, and were being brought over per S. S. ' Goalpara.' The package containing the rifles was suspected by the ship's officers and, as enquiries failed to produce an owner, it was handed over to His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas. Towards the close of the year a report reached Kuwait that a caravan which was conveying 400 rifles from Qatar for Bin Saud, had been wa yj aic f and looted by A1 Morrah Bedouins in Hassa, these being arms landed at either Doha or Wakra by Goguye/s firm. , ^ After the defeat of his force, in March, Shaikh Mubarak prohibited t e sale of firearms to foreigners and himself bought up a large number of n es and ammunition. . 1 „ The Shaikh has been permitted to import a certain n ™b e r of arms and ammunition from Maskat for his own use, and these represent almost the whole import for the year. . cppT.^! contrivances for hiding arms. . .

He also wrote to the Shaikh of Bahrain asking him not to give them asylum, and addressed the offending Towashes promising them good treatment in the future. The letters not having produced the desired effect, Shaikh Mubarak sent his son. Shaikh Salim, in his launch to the pearl banks and Bahrain as envoy, and he succeeded in inducing all to return with the exception of Hilal Umtairi, the wealthiest man in Kuwait. The season was a good one, the catch though not extraordinarily large was above average quality and prices ruled high. No pearl divers were required at the Ceylon Pearl Fisheries during the year and therefore no passes were issued for them. The British India Steam Navigation Company's slow fortnightly mail- Shipping steamers have continued to call at (Kuwait. Only one fast steamer called in the year, as a special case, to accommodate Shaikh Mubarak's Bombay Agent. The Agency launch ' Lewis Pelly ' has regularly run to and from Fao fortnightly with the Kuwait mails. The arrangement is a costly one to Government but has worked well. The British India slow mails were very irregular towards the close of the year thereby causing great inconvenience and loss to merchants. The Bombay-Persia Steam Navigation Company's vessels, since Septem ber, discontinued calling at Kuwait for want of cargo. Only two steamers of Bucknall's Steam Navigation Company called at Kuwait; one brought for Shaikh Mubarak 400 tons coal and the other to load dates. No other Company's vessels have visited the port. Shaikh Mubarak's relations with shipping Companies and their Agents have been friendly. The British India Managing Agents would, however, do well to avoid irregularities in the calling of their vessels if they do not desire a repetition of the boycotting to which the Shaikh has before subjected them. Early in January Mr. Zeytoon, of Messrs. Zeytoon, Livingstone &amp; Co. „ . j m 11 0 f Bushire, visited Kuwait to settle Foreigners and Travellers. . n „ ., , ^ TT ,. accounts with the firm of the late Haji Muhammad Taqi, an arms merchant of Kuwait., Visits of Messrs. Vram, Nichan, Hagasse and Elbaz have already been noticed under 'Arms traffic.' Fateh Ullah, a Baghdadi Christian, arrived in February to practise as a dentist, but left for Maskat after a month. He usually visits Kuwait in the winter months. In April, Mr. R. I. Money, Consulting Engineer to the National Bank of Turkey, and his companion-interpreter, Faud Bey, a Turkish Foreign office official, arrived in Kuwait. They called on the Shaikh at Sirra where he was then camped and also visited Kathama bay in the Political Agent's company. Mr. Money severely criticized the terms of the Baghdad railway concession and was not enthusiastic over the commercial possibilities of Kathama bay as a terminus. They left for Basrah on the 10th by the overland route being pro vided with transport by the Shaikh. Their visit to Kathama bay created some wild gossip, even the Shaikh being so v far carried away that he built a shed to secure the best site on the foreshore there. In the same month, one Abdul Messih Antaki Bey, the proprietor otf the Cairo newspaper ' A1 Amran,' came on a begging visit and left for Basrah after a few days stay. A surprise visits was paid to Kuwait, on the 14th of June, by M. Serge Toukholka, Russian Consul at Basrah, accompanied by his dragoman and an orderly. They came by a native boat armed with a letter of introduction from the Wali of Basrah to Shaikh Mubarak. The Political Agent showed him the sights of the town and the same evening he was persuaded to return by sea, though he desired to travel overland. Shaikh Salim, who representedPOLITICAL RESIDENCY FOE 1910. 99 his father, regarded M. Toukholka's visit with some suspicion, but treated him very'hospitably. Mons. Varin, of whom mention was made in last year's report, also paid a short vi sit to Kuwait during the year, evidently to seek trading facilities from the Shaikh, but without success. On the 24th February, Captain Birdwood (First Assistant Resident), Tours and Visits of British Officials. arrived from Bushire by the R. I. M. S. • + oi, -1 u tvt , i .

The Resident visited Kuwait twice during the year, in April and again m August. ' r &amp; Political - Agent's Tours. —The Political Agent made a month's tour to the south-west and west of Kuwait, in February, his route being to As- bata, thence to Hafar, along A1 Batin, nearly to Safwan in the north and back to Kuwait, the distance covered being over 460 miles marching The tour was a particularly interesting one, as a good deal of fresh ground was covered and some unmapped country roughly surveyed. There were, besides, some wild incidents which furnished experience of Bedouin methods of fight ing and relieved the tedium of marching. The tour was reported in detail at the time and need not be recapitulated here. ^ T??t Political A g ent vi sited His Britannic Majesty's Consuls at Basrah and Mohammerah twice during the year in the Agency steam launch ' Lewis Pelly : first in June and again in December. In the last week of August he also visited the Pearl Banks and the Politi cal Agent at Bahrain, in the steam launch ' Lewis Pelly,' proceeding thence to Bushire and returning to Kuwait, on the 8th September. On the 24th December the Political Agent accompanied His Excellency Admiral Slade to Bushire by the R. I. M. S. 'Lawrence.' He returned to Kuwait on the 27th leaving for Debai on the following day under orders from the Resident in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic.
