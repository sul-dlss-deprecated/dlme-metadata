This claim was refuted by Pelly firstly as Hajee Yacoob was a musselman, secondly as he had recovered more slaves than 'any other man in the Gulf' and thirdly as succesive residents considered him to be a most energetic and reliable man who was not as Palgrave supposed responsible for the suppression of slavery in Shargeh but was in fact the arbitrator of the maritime truce there.That Palgrave and his companion had travelled openly as Christians and been welcomed as such. Whereas Pelly had witness testimonies, including from his agent at Muscat, that Palgrave had disguised himself as a mussulman and used assumed names in order to travel and had even been seen worshipping in mosques.Claims as to the extent of the territories of Oman, that Bahrein and Qatar (amongst other places) paid tribute to Oman, that Said Saeed [Thuwaini bin Said] divided his territories up between his three sons in his will, alleged tensions between these sons and claims relating to Said Soulem [Salim II bin Thuwaini], son of Said Saeed, being a young boy. Several of these claims such as the extent of Oman's territories and the way in which they were divided up following Said Saeed's death were refuted through treaties and agreements that already existed such as Lord Canning's of 1861 which separated Muscat and Zanzibar, and a loan agreement of 1856 in which Persia agreed to lease some places to Oman. The remaining claims were refuted by Pelly's personal and detailed knowledge of Muscat and through Said Torki [Turki bin Said],son of Said Saeed who was a guest of Pelly's in Bushire at the time of his writing the responses to the statements, including that Said Soulem was actually a grown man, not a young boy, and had recently been accused of murdering his father,Also included in the file are a draft version of the statements and a copy of the witness statement of Mr Rozario, agent at Muscat, regarding Mr Palgrave passing himself off there as a mussulman called Aboo Mahmood and that he had observed him attending mosques and outwardly observing the fast.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Amir Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Lewis Pelly</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>William Henry Colvill</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Frederic John Goldsmid</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight William Henry Rodes Green</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Robert Phayre</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Earl of Northbrook Thomas George Baring</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight William Lockyer Merewether</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>William Gifford Palgrave</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Charles Umpherston Aitchison</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Wahabi (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Koweit</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baroda State</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Rajputana</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Riyadh</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Russia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sind</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zanzibar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Hasa</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x0003c7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
