She wears striped trousers with embroidered hems under a
                           jalabiya, pulled up at the elbows. On her head she wears a striped turban; her hair is plaited. She wears a necklace of beads and filigree, a bracelet on each wrist, an armlet of beads as well as an anklet on her right ankle and rings on each of her little fingers.The woman on the left wears hijab in the form of a dark-coloured cloak, striped with white around a white headdress that covers the face and head, except for the eyes. The part of the headdress covering the woman’s forehead is made of a strip of printed or embroidered material.The scene is staged on a carpet, albeit in a courtyard-like space with plants – some in wide wooden pots – foliage, including ivy, and two windows visible in the background.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing it to take on a soft-shaded paint-like quality in places.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XXVPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Mekkanerin im Brautanzug.'A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower right corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
