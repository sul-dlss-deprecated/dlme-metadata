To : Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet. Copy to : Naval Officer-in-Charge, Bahrain. PRESENTATION BY NAVAL OFFICKR IN CHARGE. BAHRAIN, TO EI3 HIGHNESS THE SHEIKH. SIR SALMAN BIN IlAu/vD BIN IGA Ah KHALIFAii« K.C.I.E. The Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain has suggested that it would be a happy idea for him, on behalf of the Royal Navy in the Persian Gulf and in particular on behalf of all serving in H.M.S.JUFAIR to present a naval sword to His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain. 2. His Highnesp has shown great courtesy, friendliness and interest in connection with the establishment and development of the base, and the gift of a small token, such as a naval sword would, I am sure, give him great pleasure. 3. Both the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Adviser to the Government have expressed their approval of this proposal, and the Political Resident, { Persian Gulf, also considers that the presentation would be much appreciated. 4. The fact that it would be merely an unembellished naval sword rather than one studded with precious stones, such as is the customary practice with potentates, would not in any way belittle the gift, but would rather enhance the value of the gift as being one on a small and intimate plane. 5. Should you approve of this suggestion may be Admiralty please be asked to supply a sword and despatch it to me by air so that undue delay may be avoided. (Sgd.)J.M.
