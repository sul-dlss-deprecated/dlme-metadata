The map features various existing and proposed lines relating to the south and south-eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia, including those bordering Qatar, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and the Aden Protectorate. There are thirteen lines and they are described in a table of references. The lines include the following: the 'blue' and 'violet' lines (boundary lines that formed part of the Anglo-Ottoman Conventions, concluded in 1913 and 1914 respectively); the Aden boundary line (delimited in 1903-1905 and confirmed in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1914); Ibn Saud's [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] 'Ojair line' (established in November 1922); further proposed lines dating from 1935 and 1937.</abstract><typeOfResource>cartographic</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Map</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100050629788.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
