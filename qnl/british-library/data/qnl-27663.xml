Temple Flame Led Him A oil—the fevered quest for more oil continues. Last week Mr. Leo Chertok, United States financier, relinquished his Abyssinian con cession—15,000 square miles. Read here of the greatest of all battles for oil fought by a missionary and snatched by a British spy. ^ T QQ f g ^HE lamp# of the Persian Temple burned with a pure white flame . . .' That sentence read in a history of Persia would have Ho special significance to you or me. When William Knox D'Arcy, thin, clean-shaven Australian mining engineer, read it, he put the book down. How did they get a pure white flame ? he wondered ; and came to the conclusion that they must have had some sort of petroleum oil. That casual reflection changed the life of D'Arcy—and developed into a drama that rocked the earth. For the Australian packed up his baggage and went to Persia. In his bitter struggles in the history of com merce, wa# achieved with no more formality than the handing out of e religious tract. Onoe the story of D'Arcy'g oil be came known, however, spies p^d agents of oil companies were swiftly on the track. D'Arcy sublet his gushers to an English company, shook off the trail of spies and agents, and embarked for New York on his way back to Australia. Offers to buy his concession cani^ by cable from London and New York With each day's voyage, the offers were increased. Three, five, six million pounds sterling were his—for the exchange of a casual slip of paper. D'Arcy refused the offers im patiently. He was more interested in one of the fellow passengers who wore the cassock of a priest. Together they paced the deck and talked of spreading the Cross in heathen lands. Persia is full of heathens, mourned D'Arcy, and the young priest won- By LEO baggage were instruments for finding oil—and a crucifix. D'Arcy was deeply religious; and as his efforts to find oil proved fruitless, so his religion became more and more, precious to him. Fortune Poured Into the Sand At the end of each discouraging day he prayed; and woke on the morrow with fresh strength to pursue his quest. With the years he grew old and haggard. He poured his own for tune and the wealth of several backers irito the sands of the Persian desert. « ■■■■&gt;■«« W' W'.h.'ai'vtf V«l 9NIN3Hi9N3»IS ONV dered if nothing could be don© to con vert them. They talked for hours ««ch day. When cables were handed to him offering higher and higher prices for his concession, the engineer tossed them aside. More urgent to him was the problem of converting Persians to Christianity. It was the young priest who solved the problem for him. Why not. he suggested, in an apparent flash of inspiration, use this concession to enable priests to enter Persia P They could go as engineers, contractors, anything.

In 1911 Germany obtained from The concession was never carried Turkey a concession for building a out, for war intervened, ailway from Berlin to Bagdad. The Historians are unanimous in ascrib- urpo«« of that concession was, ing to that concession the most potent single cause of the Great War. The present chain of tragedy in the Mediterranean—Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, the Arab revolt in Pales tine, Fascist Intervention In Spain— concessions for oil, minerals, land are inextricably woven Into the tapestry of death. Abyssinia is a rich country, especi ally in oil and minerals. For genera tions international groups have sought from successive Kings of Kings con cessions to develop the country. They have been steadily refused. Last year, Mussolini, impatient for oil, sought to secure by conquest what he could not achieve by bargaining. He did not, at first, intend the con quest of all the country. He would have been satisfied to secure the un disputed right of exploitation and leave the Emperor on his Throne. But on Aug. 10 there slipped from England a shadowy figure who had spent the fqrty years of his life seeic- ing concessions. His name was F, W. Rickett, and after a few days in Egypt he appeared in Addis Ababa. His only purpose, he declared, was to arrange for six Red Cross aero planes, given by kind Egyptian fella- een, to be brought to Abyssinia. He spoke to no legations, and, apart from casual inquiries by journalists as to how the arrangements were pro ceeding. hi? presence was ignored. Secret Trips To the Palace Nobody noticed the secret journey- ings of this stocky Englishman to the Palace of the black Emperor. Nobody, wjatching the light burning through the night in the private offices of the Negus, guessed its import. On the night of Aug 29 Rickett made the last of his secret journeys to the Palace. Hour after hour he and Palace officials read the clauses of a long document, altered them here, re drafted them there. At eight 0 clock next morning an exhausted Minister put his signature to the document on behalf of the Emperor. The document contained the terms of a vast concession for the develop ment of Abyssinia, involving an ex penditure of £10.000.000. The work was to be done not by Italy but by an Anglo-American company. Mussolini read the news in a tele gram from London, handed to him at breakfast. His own intelligence ser vice had not even smelt the deal. From that day the stream of men and money and munitions pouring from Italy to Abyssinia doubled. 'On to Addis ' became the soldiers' cry, and in a few swift weeks the capital of the King of Kings rose in flames to the sky. That was Mussolini's answar to the concession-hunters. Deat h to the Land Sellers In Palestine armed bands rove the country shooting, burning, knifing— in desperate resistance to concessions secured by the .lews. Jews who wish to buy and develop land in Palestine must pay dearlv for it—but not so dearly as the Arab land holder who sells it to them. Such Arabs are regarded as traitors. Those who are lucky live long enough to dissipate their pieces of silver in the brothels of Cairo. Others hre found murdered, with the money in tact in the folds of their robes. Yet there is also romance in con cessions. You've heard of the Great White Rajah P In 1842 James Brooke, Army officer, traveller, and merchant, came into a fortune of £30.000. With it he bought a yacht and set out on a journey to the East. He was tired of civilisation and took the road to Mandalay, seeking to build an Eden of peace. Crushed Revolt, Made a Fortune At Singapore he was asked if he would convey to the Rajah of Sarawak one or two presents, in thanks for kindness the Rajah had shown to ship wrecked sailors. Brookei thought it would put his course out a few miles. Actually it turned the course of his whole iife. He found that antimony was being mined in Sarawak; and antimony wa* becoming increasingly important in the growing industry of Britain. The merchant in him ousted lor a while the Adam in search of Eden, and he made one or two delicate inquiries about a concession. The Rajah Muda Hasim agreed; but first he asked if Brooke would mind devoting his guns to the sup pression df a rebellion that had been worrying him for three years. Brooke obliged, the immediate re bellion was crushed, and the two settled down to talk business. But other rebellion? broke out, and each harassing day brought news of more. Revolt.® sprang up like measles. Rajah Muda became demoralised. He was an easy-going, middle-aged man. anxious above all things for a quiet life. In desperation he turned to Brooke. '* I'll give you the con cession,' he promised, ' if you will rule the country for me and suppress the rebels,' Whole Country Was His Reward That was the luckiest chance a corn cession-hunter ever had— to ask for the right to sink a mine and be given the whole country. Of course, it was not quite so simple as that. Rajah Muda Hasim later forgot his promise, and had to be forcibly reminded of it. Brooke had to put his entire fortune into the task of restoring order. But in the end he won through and became the world's first White Rajah. His descendants rule Sarawak to this day. And, going from the sublime to the restaurant, his great-grand* daughter Princess Pearl is married to —yes, Harry Roy. Sand, oil. murder, religion, war, rebellion, and the private life of a band leader—all drawn inextricably, into the pattern shaped by the con cession hunters of the world.Telegram From To No. Q Political Resident, Buthire, Political Agfcnt, Bahrain, Nil.

(E 5262/201/3U) 11th October, 1958. %Y) Dear G-ibson, / I enclose herein a record of a discussion which I liad last month with Ivlylies, Lees and Browne, of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, arising from their wish to have some advice about the oest way of defining the Comoany's concession area in --ersia, '.vhich, as you :cnow, has to 'be done 'before the 3'lst December, 193S• You will see that we were concerned with three points, namely : (1) t /hether His llajesty^s G-overnment would raise an;y ocjection to the maritime boundary of the concession area being drai/n, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit, (2) Kow to draw the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and (3) What is the position as regards the High Seas. Since the meeting I have been able to confirm that what I said about the High Seas, as recorded in paragraph 11 oi tne enclosure, was correct, and that the generally recognised view of international law with regard to the bed oi the open sea and the subsoil beneath it is that the sea bed and the subsoil is res nulliuo , but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. •5* During tne meeting, however, it escaped ny mind that questions (1) and (3) above were dealt with in recent correopondence between the India Office and ourselves about the concession to be granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited in the 'liahrein Unallotted Area'. In that case, too, the question arose how to define the maritime boundary of the concession,/ Gibson, Ssq..3./ u 0 &gt; v a I /a \ '-k ' 2 - « ^\ f j\ concession and our point of view was explained in a minute by Beckett enclosed in Brenan's letter to you No. 3 2288/U13/91 of the 25th April, 1933. In this minute Beckett pointed out that as far as the maritime regions of the concession were concerned, the oovious intention was that the J or. 10 any should have the right to extract oil from the land unde r t he sea , and tu-iut alGiioa^n tne Sheikh of bahrein had at present no right to land under the sea outside the three mile limit, it is i ecognised that the oed of the sea and the land under it is capable Ox accjuisition beyond that limit. ?or this reason BecKett recommended that it would be better to substitute for tne v/ord 'waters' in uhe draft concession the words 'submerged land the effect of which would be to give the Company the right to tne land oelow the sea immediately within the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit as soon as they had appropriated it . ^ Now 1 think this suggestion of Beckett points to the means we are looking for of evading the difficulty about territorial waters which presents itself, or seemed to do so, in ohe caoe 01 the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's concession in oince my discussions with the Company T s representatives I have looked up the Persian law about territorial waters. ^ &lt;;y . copies 01 this lav/ were sent to you under cover of Foreign Oixicu letter rTo. T 636Vi+ikQ/^dO of the 3rd Augus : 1934 and a further copy is enclose coherein for convenience of reference. Yoa ^ill oee from Article I tnat although the Persians claim ohc right oi control to a distance of twelve miles from the coaso, they lay specific claim to the bed of the sea only as far as six miles. Possibly, however, they would maintain that national interests' entitle them to control of mineral deposits up to the full twelve mile limit.aA 3- 5. Ve would suggest, therefore, that the Oompany should place the limits of their concession, wherever they wish to do so, up to a distance of twelve miles from the Persian coast, making it clear that the areas included 'beyond the coast are areas of sea bed . This would prevent the possibility of the Persian G -overnment, at some future date, claiming the right - which, owing to the diversity of views about territorial waters, it would be difficult to dispute - to grant to another concern portions of the sea bed inside the twelve mile limit in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company might be interested. From the Persian point of view the entire area within the limits drawn by the Company would then be Persian territory. Prom the point of view of His Majesty's Government, however, the area as delimited would consist of Persian territory only up to the three mile limit, and as regards the parts of the sea bed outside that limit which the Company would have included in their concession area, the Company would not really have a right to them - as being under the high Seas - until they had taken steps to appropriate them. As we are presumably not in the least anxious that these areas should De api^ropriated by anybody else, both the Persians and ourselves would be perfectly happy. 6* You will also be aware that in July 1936 our Legation at Caracas were instructed to initiate discussions with the Venezuelan Government with a view to the Governments of Trinidad and Venezuela taking simultaneous and parallel action to divide up as national territory between them the sea bed 01 the G-ulf of Pari a or such parts of it as might be of use for oil boring. As regards question (2) namely the best way of drawing the boundary of the Company's area at the mouth of the ohat,t-e 1 -Arab (referred to in paragraph 9 of the enclosed record), it has since occurred to me that the Company should draw// k. draw their boundary here in such a way as to kec.j clear of the line dividing Persian from Irani territorial waters, as His Majesty's Government conceive the line should most fairly be drawn (i.e. the principle that a ship is always in the waters of the country to whose coast it is closest). The difficulty about the Company doing this would, I think, be that they could not give any satisfactory explanation to the Persian Government if the latter were inquisitive about their reason for drawing the line in such a peculiar way, since it would have no geological justification. So far as geology is concerned, the Company's desire is to get as much of the sea bed as they can in that part of the world. I should be grateful if you would let me know as soon as you can if you agree with the foregoing views, or if you have any comments to make. I am sending a similar letter to Jones (Admiralty) and Starling (Petroleum Department) and am sending a copy to the Board of Trade. Yours ever, ( Sd.) Lacy Baggallay.p.z. 6994/1938. COPY. (E 5262/201/3U) Anglo-Iranian Oil Ooapany's C onee s si on Are a. Mr. Mylies ? of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, called on Mr. Bag^llay this afternoons accompanied 'by Dr. Lees, the Company's Chief Geologist and I t . - v . E. Browne, the Company's Surveyor, in order to ask advice about the 'best v/ay of defining the limits of the area or areas totalling 100,000 square miles of Persian territory which the Company were now obliged, before the 31st December 193o and under the terms of the 1933 Concession Agreement, to choose as thoce in which they wished to operate their concession for the future. 2. Mr. Mylies and his colleagues explained that up to certain depths of water modern boring machinery made it possible to tap oil fields lying under the sea and that there were parts of the sea in the .ersian Gulf which the Company wished to include in the area of their potential operations. They understood that His Majesty's Government held that three miles was the limit of territorial waters, whereas the Persian Government claimed a belt of twleve miles. Alon t '; most of the Persian coast the width of sea which the Company wished to include in their concession was within the three mile limit. At the northern end of the Gulf, however, there were parts of the sea in the twelve mile belt which they wished to include. 3. Furthermore the chosen areas had to be precisely demarcated in order that the Persian Government mi^ht be able to checxu the measurements for themselves and make sare that they did not exceed 100,000 square miles in all. Vims applied to the demarcation of such sections of the bound ries as followed/followed the coast cis well as to inland sections. as the existing naps of Southern Persia were inaccurate ix was proposed to show these boundaries by fixing certain coordinates (whether on land or sea) and joining then together. ..long most of the coast they would fix a number of straight lines just skirting the coast-line on the seaward side, with the object of allov/ing for uncertainties or future changes in that line and also of rendering mensuration easier. At Jask they would carry the boundary out for about three miles. It was only at the northern end, as had been said, that they wished to carry it out for as far as twelve miles. Lj., The Company wished to know whether the submission by them to the Persian Government of plans showing that they hud chosen for their concession areas extending beyond the three mile limit, approved as they woald necessarily have been by the Board of Directors, of whom two were representatives of His Majesty 1 s Government3 would commit His Majesty's Government to a recognition of the Persian claim to a territorial limit of twelve miles. In other words, would His Ivlajesty's Government object to the inclusion in the concession areas of waters outside the three mile limit ? 5- Mr. Baggallay explained shortly the position as regards territorial waters. It was true that His Majesty's Government, largely, he thought, for reasons connected with fisheries, held to the three aile limit. Most other countries accepted this view. Persia, however, claimed twelve miles, though he thought that she regarded this belt as divided into two fringes of six miles each and claimed rights falling short of full sovereignty in the outer fringe. He woula look up the Persian law on the subject and let the Company knov exactly what it laid down. Other countries besides 1-ersia, for instance/instance Norway, the Union of Soviet Socialist Re .10lies and he believed lortu :al, also claimed nore than three miles. 6. The position in international lav/ was uncertain. Efforts to reach international agreement on the subject had so far come to nothing, and although other countries could not say' that His Majesty's Government were wrong in maintaining that the proper limit was three miles, His Majesty's Government could not say that those countries were wrong in saying that the limit could and should be increased. Thus, if the matter were referred to arbitration the case would probably go in favour of whoever happened to be the defendant. If, for instance, His Majesty's Government took the .ersian Government to court because they objected to some act of sovereignty done by the Persian Government or their agents in waters lying between three and twelve miles from the Persian coast, they would probably be told that they had failed to prove that the Persian Government had no right to do what they had done in those waters. If on the other hand the Persian Government took His Liajesty's Government to court because of something done by, say, one of His -vlajesty's Ships in such waters, they would probably be the ones to be told that they had failed to show that the warship had no right to do what it had done. 7« It was conceivable that, as time went on, the mineral potentialities of the bed of the sea, as brought to light by the problem facing the present meeting, would prove to be more important than questions of fishing rights and make it desirable for His Majesty's Government themselves to claim more extensive territorial limits. (Dr. Lees quoted a case in point from the seas adjoining Trinidad). This, however, was mere speculation and for the moment His Majesty's Government were concerned to maintain as best they could, notwi ths tanding/u. notwithstanding the uncertain legal xosition he had described, the principle of the three mile liinit. Nevertheless he thought that Hie Ilajesty's Government would not wish, if they could possibly avoid it, to press the Company to forego the possibility of boring outside the three mile limit in conditions giving them a reasonable assurance of exclusive possession. He wondered whether? in order to make it as easy as possible for Kis Jvlajesty's Government to do so, it would not be possible to find some formula whereby the area delimited by the Company could be referred to in such terms as would not identify it too closely with eithei' the three mile or the twelve mile limit. He also enquired whether it would not be possible to say simply that in certain places the boundaries of the concession area or areas were 'the limits of Persian territorial waters'. It was, after all, possible that before the Company's concession expired in 1993 an international conference might fix territorial waters at six or ten or even twenty miles. Such a formula would guard the Company against all eventualities. In any case he would like to give the matter further consideration. 8. Mr. Mylies and his colleagues thought a suitable formula could be found and said that they also w jald give it their thought. They did not, however, t.iin-: that a mere mention of the 'limits of territorial waters' would be sufficient, since the Persian Government would either regard it as too vague, or else claim that it meant that the whole of the twelve mile (or at least six mile) limit was included in the concession areas - which might swallow up a lot of the 100,000 square miles. 9* They next asked how the Company should draw the boundary of their area at the mouth of the Sh.tt-el-Arab, seeing that the frontier was delimited only as far as a point just below/u* 5. below Pao on the left banlc of the river. After Mr. Baggallay had given a short explanation of the position, as His Majesty f s Grovernnent sav: it, under the 19^3 Protocol and the Proces Verbaux and of the various methods v/hich had been advanced for defining international frontiers where they passed through territorial waters (none of which had, however, universal international sanction), he said that so long as the Company choose a boundary which left the whole Rooka Channel outside their area he did not thine (subject to the question of territorial waters already discussed) that His Majesty's Government would wish to raise any objection to their fixing one of their coordinates at the tip of j,lara-cat Abadan and from there carrying their line out to sea more or less as a prolongation of the final section of the left ban;: of the river The Company's representatives agreed to avoid the Hool-ia Channel completely. 10. Dr. Lees then asked what was the position as regar the High Seas. Would it be possible for the Company, if they wished to do so, to sink shafts in the High Seas, join them together with buoys and ropes and claim exclusive rights within the area thus enclosed ? 11. Mr. Baggallay said that it was considered to be legally possible in certain circumstances to stake a claim to the bed of the sea as opposed to its surface. The pearl fishers in the Persian G-ulf might be said to have acquired prescriptive rights to certain banks in the nigh Seas, and he believed that some of the Cornish tin mines extended out to sea beyond the three mile limit and that Mis Majesty's Government claimed that the tin deposits which lay -under the sea outside the three mile limit could be and had been appropriated. But these were both examples of rights acquired as the result of exclusive enjoyment and possession during a long period of time The/6. \j '• The general theory was that the High Seas could not 'be appropriated 'by States or individuals and though he thought that there might he nothing to prevenv the Company from boring anyv/here they liked in the 'bed of the sea below the High Seas, so long as they did not thereby interfere with navigation or fisheries, it seemed to hin very doubtful if they would be able to shut off a larger area than they needed for each shaft and claii exclusive rights within that area. In other words they would not be able to appropriate an entire oil formation below the High Seas or prevent anybody else from sinlcing shafts adjoining their own. If, on the other hand, nobody else did in fact sink any shafts, they might in course of time acquire a prescriptive right to such a formation. 12. In conclusion, Mr. Mylles and his colleagues emphasised the fact that the question was far from being academic. Their researches pointed to the probability that five or six large oil fields migh. lie somewhere in the region comprised by the flat country at the head of the Persian Gulf and the adjacent sea and in a few years it mighb be technically possible to tap the fields under the sea through even greater depths of water than at present. It was quite possible that in about ten years they might wish to start operations in parts of the sea-bed lying as far as twelve miles from the Persian Coast at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, (Intld.) .i.

A BILL COIICEICTI^ COJTT HOL OV£:R FRONTIiilR 7 ATER3 : The Minister of the Interior submitted yesterday (June 2i4-th, 1934) the follov/ing Bill to the Hajliss for acceptance Law concerning the specification of the limits of coastal waters and a govcrn/.ient zone of control in seas; passed on (Tir 2li.th 19^3) (July '15th, 1934). To the honourable National Consultative Assembly: In order that the limits of frontier waters of the State, and of zones of control of the Government in the sea may be defined, and in order to avoid certain micundcrstandingc, I novr submit, and request the acceptance of, a bill containing eight articles which specifies the limits of frontier waters and of the control of the government in the seas of Persia. First Chapter : On territorial waters and zones of control: Article I . That portion of the sea which extends along the coast up to the distance of six nautical miles from the coasts of Persia, reckoned from the lowest tides, is accounted Persian territorial water, and in this zone whatever is situated below the bottom of the sea, on the surface of the sea, and above it, belongs to the State of Persia. Moreover, in regard to the execution of certain laws and agreements relating to security, defence, national interests, or to the preservation of shipping routes, another Zone, which shall be named the Zone of Naval Control, and shall be such that the Imperial Government shall have/lf&gt; 2. have the right of control therein, shall extend parallel to the coast to a distance of twelve nautical miles from the limit of the lowest tide. Remark: A nautical mile is equivalent to 1,352 metres. Article II : 7ith regard to hays (or 'little gulfs') the boundary of territorial waters shall 'begin from a straight line joining the outermost point of one side of the bay to the outermost point of the other side of the bay: and if the width of the mouth of the bay is more than ten nautical miles, t-e line of the territorial waters shall be situated at the nearest part of the union of the bay with the sea, that part being such that its breadth does not exceed ten nautical miles. 17i.th regard to ports, the limit of territorial waters will begin from a line lying between the permanent buildings of the port which are the furthest advanced in the direction of the sea. Article III . Every island which belongs to Persia shall have special territorial waters of its own, the limits of which will be determined in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Article 1 (the first portion). In regard to an archipelago the islands which compose it shall be regarded as a single island, and the distance of the territorial waters of the archipelago shall be reckoned from those islands which are furthest from the centre of the archipelago. Second Chapter : The conditions of entry and anchorage of foreign war-ships in Persian waters, and the arrangements laid down for them: Article IV./3. .Article IV. Poreign war-ships and submarines, on condition ^ that they travel on the surface of the v/ater,. have the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of Persia, ■unless the above-mentioned ships belong to States which are at war, in which case the national and international dispositions which are laid down for times of war and for the safeguarding of neutrality will be put into force. The conditions of transit for war-ships, alluded to in the first portion of this article, shall be defined in a speci Regulation, particularly with regard to the fixation of the number of those ships. Article V. The conditions of anchorage of foreign warships in Persian territorial waters shall also be determined in a special Regulation. The above-mentioned ships must observe, while in the waters alluded to in t is Law, the Laws and Regulations of Persia. A rticle VI . The Government may, on grounds of national protection, or for other important causes, prohibit the transit or anchorage of foreign warships in certain ports or in portions of territorial waters. The above-mentioned ports and portions will be named 'Forbidden Zones'. Article VI I. Foreign war-ships, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from customs inspection, and customs duties will be charged only on those goods, which are imported from the above-mentioned ships to the coast for consumption. The above-mentioned ships, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from port dues, tonnage dues, and similar imposts. Article VIII . The examination of misdemeanours (^unheri) and crimes ( .janayat ) which may take place on foreign war -ships aie outside/outside the jurisdiction of 1 Persian courts. Sentences of capital punishment which nay be pronounced 'by foreign courts must not be executed in Persian territorial waters or zones of control. Prime :lini ster.

Dear Ir. ylles, I am soriy that we have been so long in giving you our considered views on the various questions comected with the definition of your area in Iran, which were raised in your conversation witn Baggallay on the 7th jeptember. The delay is due to the fact that we have had to consult other Government departments, and have had to examine a number of rather complicated points. 2. You as.ced for our views on the following three questions: (i) whether Hie Majesty^ Governftent ^o^ld raise any objection to the maritine boundary of the concession area being drawn, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit; (ii) what is the position as regards the high seas, and (ili) how to draw the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. 1 uestions (1) and i i). ' — ■' ■' 1 ■ m «l ■ ■ 3. As regards the maritime portions of the Cora .ny^ concession, the obvious intention is that the Com aiv should have the right to extract oil, rtot from the e 1 water, but from the land under the sea . e thin that this is the principle on which the Company should wor in defining the maritime portions of their concessions, i.e. they should concentrate on 'sea bed' rather than 'waters'*, for/ c. Mylies, Ks ., Anjlo—Iranian Oil Company.s'3 for in this way it should be . ossible to avoid altogether the difficult question of territorial waters. U* Now, in this country^ linerals appear unqueotionabiy to vest in the Crown inside the thr .e mile limit. Outside the three mile limit, i.e. under what His majesty's Ooverniaent consider to be the high seas, they appear to vest in the Grown if and when they are effectively occupied by a mining company. It is, moreover, the generally recognised view of international law, with regard I j the bed of the open sea and the subsoil beneath it, that the sea-bed and the subsoil is roe mllius . but that it 18 capable of acquisition by effective occ ipatlon in t.ic sa^e maniier as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. The position, therefore, as regards the sea-bed off the Irunian coast is that up to the three mile line e r cognise the sea-bed as being Iranian. Beyond that line ohe Iranian doverniient re ard the sea—bed as Iranian up to the six mile line, and may possibly, now or at some future date, claim that ''national interests' give them the right of control to mineral deposits up to the twelve mile line. In the view of His Majesty's Government, however, the subsoil outside the three mile line is res nulljus and can be acquired only by effective occupation. Our advice, therefore, to the Company is as follows: (i) The Company should obviously not lay claim to more sea-bed than they really think they want, because of the danger of wasting their preciou. 100,000 square miles on territory to which they might not subsequently be able to establish a t tie. (ii) The Company should be virtually safe vis-a- is of Iran in including areas up to the three mile line, and probably uj to the six mile line. (ill)/(V)/ (Hi) Between the six and twelve aile lini, rights coald probably be acquired by effective occupation. fhc Company, however, co^ld not expect any support from His ?4ajesty , s Governaent in any claim for areas beyond the three mile line which they had not effectively possessed, since, in the view of His Jajesty's Oovernment, the raere granting of a concession is not in itsell' sufficient to establish national or proprietary rights to the sea-bed under the high seas. Therefore, once the area has been defined and accepted by the Iranian Oovem .ent, the Company would be well advised to talce immediate ate g to establish effective occupation, as far as is reasonably practicable, of those ^.arts which are outside the three mile line. For such occupation of these ^arts to be effective, it wo .Id probably be necessary to erect on them artificial co. ; s ir Actions and derricks, and it would not be enough merely to ring them round with buoys. It ,-ould be very unsatisfactory if the Company included in its claim areas from which it were later found impossible to exclude interlopers. At the same time the Company would not, of course, wish to omit areas in which they might be interested and which the Iranian Government might at some future jatc clai a the righ to grant to another concern. (iv) That part of the concession ..hich refers to the maritime area should be worded so as to apply to H sea-bed' rather than to 'vaters' and the limits should be expressed as geographical co-ordinates in order to avoid any relationship to territorial waters.{r i It is presumed that the Company will ensure that no danger to navigation will be involve I by the occupation and development of areas of the sea-bed outside the three mile line# We sho-ldf however» be glad if the Company woald let us have a chart showing their pro, osed claim as soon as they have finally settled it, in order that this point may be checked. e should# moreover, expect the Company, before beginning operations on what we consider to be high seas, or in the neighbourhood of the 3hatt-el-Arab, to consult with us and make all provision which we may consider necessary for the Safety of navigation and the protection of any pre-existing rights of His Majesty's Government or the Arab States, ami for the prevention of oil pollution. These are matters which will need de ailed consideration at a later sta ;e. (\i) Outside the twelve mile line the osition as regards the acquisitio l of rights is as explained above, i.e. similar to that outside the three mile line. It ^vould hardly be desirable for the Com any to include areas outside that line within their 100,000 square miles area, and in any case I gather from what was said at the meeting that the Com any have no intention of doin : so. ^uestio&lt; (iiii. 6. ve should have no objection to the Company drawing their boundary close to - though we shoald prefer that it did not actually coincide with - the line dividing Iranian j rom Iraqi territorial waters as Hie Majesty's Qovera ent conceive the line should most fairly be drawn # i.e. the locus/A vi 5. locus of points e^aidiatant froa the Iraqi and Ira:., .a coasts. A drawing is enclosed giving tine line as accepted interde, art aentaliy here. This is for &gt; r confidential infonuation only and snoald not be comi;iunicated to the Iranians. Your line here as elsewhere should, of course, be described by geographical co-ordinates without reference to any divisio of territorial waters. (3d.) C. .

Since Mr. Baker is the Head Geologist of Petroleum Joncessions Limited if such is the recommendation he gives on his return to London no doubt his suggestions will be followed and next October will see a resumption of activity by the Company in Muscat territory.By Air Mail.

I said that I had noticed that the Southern area of the concession might possibly 'be held to include the Islands of Tamb and Bumusa, as the Iranian Government claimed these as part of their territory and would consequently regard them as Iranian Islands lying within the defined area. I did not supnose that the Company, with so large an area to cover, would 'be interested in small islands, especially as red oxide was excluded, but I thought it might be well to remind him that these two islands were not Iranian, and that it would not be possible for a foreign company to work there, in the unlikely event of their wishing to, under a concession granted by the Iranian Government. 2# Monsieur Buttingha Wichers said that, from what he had heard while the concession was being negotiated, he thought it unlikely that the Company would take any interest in the Islands, except for Qishim Island. He undertook, however, as soon as any of the Dutch managers returned to this country, to pass on to them what I had said about Tamb and Bumusa. In the circumstances I do not think there is any danger of the conpany being tempted to interfere with the islands. The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, i ; , G • : • O • • , ' ■. - • .

Their European labour Is ofcourse In an Infinitely better position than Government of India employees In the Gulf, as apart from air conditioned quarters and cluos, they have fresh fruit, meat and vegetables brought from South Africa and Australia in tankers. I was taken through Immense cold storage chambers where I saw mountains of bacon, cheese and other perishables which are unobtainable elsewhere• Apparently some nutrition expert from England has recently visited Abadan and decided that their Persian labour (almost certainly the best fed labour in the Middle East) are under nourished and solUanly recommended a kilo of cheese per head a monthI This is b(?ing obtained from Australia, and the first consignment was actually on the way. 4. The clothing arrangements were most efficient and simple to work. Jameson, who was very proud of it all, as he may well be, had apparently secured export permits for £ 97,000 worth of English made suits which were in grade A and B. A was good reach-me-down standard and B a poorer variety, but Very welcome to Persians. Every had a card entitling him to buy a coat jpid/vC, trousers, and he simply handed in his coupon, gave his measurements, and made his choice. Shoes, shirting and other articles were distributed in a similar way. and I was interested to see that the unusually intellegent staff was what is euphemistically termed 'Palestinian' I studied the system on one of the biggest mines on the Rand in 1941 and should say that the A.I.O.C.cone is better, because it is more embracing. X am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosure to Peel and Bahrain. Sd. Geoffrey Prior Sir Olaf Caroe, KCIE, CSI, ICS.
