                  <summary>Letter to David ‘the great Nasi, Head of the exile of all Israel’ (i.e. David b. Daniel), late 11th century, from a woman afflicted with a disfiguring disease, which has left her impoverished. The
                     woman explains that she ‘doesn’t have a husband, son, daughter, brother, or
                     sister’, and asks for a charitable collection to be taken for her, either in Cairo or in ‘the
                     city’. Opens with quotes from Psalms 20:2-3, 72:13. The letter was written by a scribe, rather than the woman herself, as a slip of the pen ('her face', corrected to 'my face') reveals. </summary>

            <p>‘The Lord answer you in the day of trouble! The name of the God of Jacob protect
               you!’ (Psalms 20:2) ‘May He send you help from the sanctuary, and give you support
               from Zion’ (Psalms 20:3) ‘He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives
               of the needy’ (Psalms 72:13)</p>
            <p>To the honourable, great and holy, glorious crown and diadem, a good name from above.
               To our master and teacher, our lord David the Great Prince, Head of all Israel in
               Exile, may our God keep him and our Lord preserve him and our Creator protect him,
               and may God allow him to see male offspring from his loins, to take his place and the
               place of his righteous ancestors. May He extend his days and his years in delight.
               Amen.</p>
            <p>Your poor maidservant — pathetic, grief-stricken, wretched, worried and impoverished
               by my sins — I hereby present my supplication [before the Lord and] before you, that
               you may pay heed to the words of your maidservant, ‘because my sighs are many and my
               heart is [faint]’ (Lamentations 1:22), for I am all alone: I have neither husband,
               nor son, nor daughter, nor brother, nor sister. I am ‘like a lonely bird on a
               rooftop’ (Psalms 102:8). As my sins and my transgressions increased, I developed a
               serious affliction upon my nose, and the infection spread, and it festered and my
               face was eaten away. This disease is worsening, and I cannot perform any work. I am
               naked, thirsty, and I lack everything. I am powerless. There is no one to take care
               of me, even if I were to die. Now then, [I] throw myself down before the Lord and
               before my lord, that you might show pity to me, according to your kindness, and take
               action for me, for the sake of the Lord and the sake of the merit of your righteous,
               pious and pure ancestors. ‘You will decide on a matter, and it will be established
               for you, and light [will shine] on your ways’ (Job 22:28). And may my lord order a
               charitable collection in any place that our lord desires, either in Cairo or the
               city, that I may find compassion and respite from the Lord and from you. And let my
               lord not send me back empty-handed [...] and humiliated from him. I shall be praying
               to the Lord for your pleasant and good name. And may God Almighty bless you, make you
               fruitful and multiply you, so that you become a congregation of nations, and may He
               give Abraham’s blessing to you and to your descendants with you. And may your
               wellbeing increase and grow, and may your honour accrue and become greater than all
               others’, forever and for all eternity. Amen.</p>
