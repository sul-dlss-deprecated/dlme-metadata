With regard to Muscat finances. As you know Government are oftly going to continue the Arms Traffic subsidy for another three years, which means that counting this year the State will losea Lakh after *34. This means that some pretty drastic economy will have to be made in the (R V budgets for^l933-34. Could you please consider this question and let me have your general ideas, we have time enough before us but finance questions are better taken in time and not in a hurry at the last moment.

Yea, I'm sorry in many ways to leave Muscat, and look forward to seeing you a^ain when 1 come there on tour. 2. There should be no difficulty about your leave, 1 think, as if you are replaced at Jiuscat it will be from outside the Political cadre, and as you say it would be just as well for you to be given the 'once over 41 by some medical expert at home: I hope the •tummy' has been behav ing itself pretty well of late? 3. But the question of your leave is linked up with that of your successor. If the Btate can carry on for the future without a financial Adviser cum Commandant, Muscat Infantry, then i would like you to frame the Budget for next year, see it 6n its way, and go on leave in the Spring of 1935. If on the other hand the State needs a permanent successor to you then a convenient time for you to hand over to him would be—as you suggest— at the end of the Muscat financial year in December. 4./ tain H.0. Alban, itidal Agent, cat.IG - 2 - 4. Of course the yinaftoial Adviser costs tiie State per annua his salary and passages tout on the other hand it ca, yV J /v6^fgets good value for its money, especially in view of the fact that the financial Adviser also doubles the psrt of Commandant, and personally I shall feel distinctly easier in my mind as long as there is a British officer at Muscat in charge of these duties 9 and definitely respons ible for carrying them out. The only alternative would be for the Political Agent to taioe charge of these duties* There are various strong objections to this* There is first the ^Constitutional 14 one that the Political Agent, who is also Hie Majssty^ Consul unlike his colleagues at Bahrain and Kuwait, is the representative of His majesty^ Oovemment and the Indian Oovermaent to the State* It is therefore difficult to see how he can any way be put in charge of the btate departments of finance and Defence* At the same time provided there is a British officer in charge of these departments, the JPolitical Agent can holdja watching brief over these activities of the State, in which we are especially interested, assist the State and the financial Adviser by his advice, and when necessary forward euggestlons to the .Political nesident in connection with proposals which need the sanction of the latter, or of the Government of India (vide for instance Muscat letter Ho* r 17/17/681 of 13th June 1932 to the late Sir Hugh Blscoe, recommending a revision of this yea^s budget *\ xhe other objec- on to the . p.a. looking after the state's finance and jj ^ience is that he hae t got the time:the combined posts of jr.A. and Coiaradt. is a whole^time job. As far as the sultan is concerned I imagine that he will want a financial Adviser ( cum Command ant) for at any rate the next three years, which will be difficult ones owing to the loss of the Arms subsidy after February 1936 (vide correspondence ending with foreign and jc^olltical Department Express Letter Ho* f*i61-H/32 of the let September 1932, copy forwarded under Bushire endorsement iio* 641-8, dated the 9th September 1932,)* He only trusts two •? v r . ( &gt;two people in the State, whom he feels are honest and die- Interested: one is the i 'olitical Agent and the other the financial Adviser, and he told me^-ttore than once-—that it was a great relief to have an officer in charge of his finance and Defence in whou he could hare absolute con fidence. He already works hard as you know, and if the financial Adviser is removed he will, Z think, find the daily burden of personally supervising the details of his finances, an intolerable one. He has of course many other claims on his time, and should be able to give that personal attention to his subjects and their wants and petitions which Arabs regard as the first duty of a Huler. Even if he could dispense with a financial Adviser, 1 don 9 t see how we could do without a Commandant* If the Muscat Infantry is to be kept up to its present atandard then I think a British officer is necessary, and if it is not to be kept up to its present standard, then it had better be disbanded as such and merged with the very irregular ^askaris* 4 which the State already keep up. Please approach the sultan on the general question of the retention of a Financial Adtiser cum Commandant for say the next three years, and let Me have his views as well as your wwn. 6. With regard to your brother. (Is he married by the way ,) Sii Hugh did not send on his application to (rovern— ment. x imagine he considered that while it was unsettled how long you were going to stay at Muscat, and whether any 'mancial Adviser would succeed you, there was not much point \ in so doing, unce, however, it is decided that a Jitnancial A-.-viat:r cum Commandant will be required in muscat to succeed you, I ar.i prepared to recommend his appointment to Government. iix8 11 nations seem very adequate, and air JPrancis Humphrys uas recommended him strongly. I see also that he is an old (runner, and gamers are generally level-headed fellows. He will alao cost the state less than you do, as it will not have to pay for hi® Pfcnaion and Passage Contributions. If you and the■ -4- are of opinion that you should be succeeded by a permanent inourabent and the aultan Is prepared to accept your brother, please put up—in consultation of course with His Highness— your proposals as to what your brother^ contract should be*COHFIDBMTIA L, D.O.Ho.C/178. id lb* I 0 - \ The Political Agency &amp; H.B.M's Consulat Muscat, 19th October 1932# 1&gt;V ' itiom i' 5 Many thanks for your demi-official letter Ko«681-S dated September 19th about my leave and successor. 2» The Sultan told me that he will require an English man to take my place ^but that there was no hurry about it and thot he preferred to leave the matter over for discussion with you on your arrival here on tour in December. I did not therefore say anything about my brother. JrH JB&amp; who the way^ is a bachelor. (Vide your query). 3« There is, as the Sultan says, really no hurry about a successor as now that the Zakat assessment has been done and the Customs department brought more under control, it only remains to watch that revenue is regular ly paid; expenditure of c: ourse / is well in hand already. Rai Sahib Dhulichand is doing remarkably well, he has Just been on tour up the Batinah the results of which reflects greatly to his credit. Zakat payments are everywhere beginning to come in now while trade shows a slight up ward tendency. 4. With regard to the Budget, I think that there is little doubt that the State will get the whole of the Ks 6,53,000 budgetted for this year, to say nothing of any surplus that may accrue.

If, in addition, the projected raising of the Customs duties to 10% is sanctioned, it looks as if the Sultan will not be c called on to make any great economies to offset the loss of the Arms Subsidy* 5* Hai Sahib Phulichand is, like most Hindoos, a keen business-man, he has got the finance under excellent control and also goes out himself to see that HeYenues are paid* I think he is a sound investment and will keep the adminis tration in good working order* It will be a good thing to h&amp;Te an Englishman (of the right sort) as Adviser,as it gives the Finance Administration a Head and is also neces sary for the Levy Corps# C.

(b) His Highness sees no reason to accord a passage by P. &amp; 0. when other cheaper and adequately comfortable lines are available* (c) The Sultan has ruled out the clause pertaining to travelling allowance on the grounds that it was not included in any former contract and he is unwilling to start a pre cedent. .hen necessity demands it a car or other transport will be put at the financial Advisees disposal at State expense.All previous contracts have been tanuin&amp;.ble at three months notice and His Highness wishes this clause to remin N in force. As regards Clause 6, His Highness has accepted my advice that under extenuating circumstances it may be desirable if not necessary, to pay the incumbent 1 s passage on sick leave. Such circumstances would arise in the event 01 serious illness, incident or accident directly attributable tc Sta^e service.

G. Alban aa Financial Adviser and Commandant Muscat Infantry to the Muscat State. */hen CaptaiJ Alban was appointed it was for the period roughly of about one year at the end of which the situation would again fee reviewed ( vide the late Sir Hugh Biscoe's letter to you, N0 .8IO-S, of 25th November 1931). This period is now draw ing to a close. Captain Alban, who has done excellent work as Adviser and Commandant, has completed »^re than three years* service in the Persian Gulf, his health, nas not been very good of late, and he wishes to proceed on long leave \ to England in April next, which leave I am recommending to Government. The question of his successor at Huscat V\ therefore -arises* \ 2. In the letter quoted above the possibility was contemplated by Sir Hugh Biscoe (and I may add by myself as Political Agent, Muscat) that the State at the end of 1932, ♦ K1932, or thereabouts, might be able to dispense altogether with the services of a Financial Adviser. In the light of the experience gained in the past year, and with a view to the difficult times ahead, loss of the Arms Subsidy in 193 j for instance, I am not, however, of opinion tnat tms dis pensation can be effected, and personally I shall feel much happier for some time to come as long as there is a British Officer at Muscat in charge of Finance and Defence. If, however, the Sultan had expressed a wish to carry on without the assistance of a British Officer I would certainly have given His Highness' opinion a most sympathetic hearing# But on discussing the matter with him on my tour to Muscat last November, I found him to be of the same view as outlined in paragraph 5 of Sir Hugh Biscoe 1 s letter already quoted. Briefly - surrounded as he is by innumerable elder male relations. His Highness - who is barely twenty two - trusts but two persons in his Statei one the Political Agen^, the other the Financial Adviser, provided the latter is a British Officer, and therefore beyond and above all local intrigues. His Highness was most reluctant to lose Captain i-.lban s services, but if the latter had to go then definitely he wanted another British Officer in his place. 3. This main point having been settled, I discussed with His Highness the question as to who the British Oilicer was to be, and suggested Captain Alban's brother. Captain B.C.H.Alban, who had already submitted to Sir Hugh Biscoe an application for the post in question, (vide cop^ of his letter of 17th December 1931, which I attach). Sir Hugh Biscoe took no action on this application since the appointment of Captain R. G. Alban was then under considera tion. Now that the latter was going, however, his brother seemed to be a suitable substitute, possessing the necessary qua 1 i f i c at i ons, . •. •.qualifications, ( vide hir- record of service as set forth in his letter), and being moreover - as you will see - vouched for by Sir Francis Humphrys. I had not met Captain S .C.H .Alben mjiself, but had heard him well spoken of by one or two officers who had met him in 'Iraq. His Highness intimated that he thcq^lt Captain S.C.H.Alban to be a suitable individual for the post. With regard to terms I left one or two su^estions with the Political Agent as a basis for discussion with His Highness, and for communication to me in due course# 4, I now enclose copies of the correspondence noted in ) the mergin !• M morandum Bo 0 G/211 of 20th December 1932 from ) the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Political ) which Resident, with enclosure. ) ) explain 2« Letter No.C/35 of 12th November 1932 from the \ Political Resident to His Highness the Sultan ^ themselves, of Muscat* ) ) The Sultan, 3« Letter dated 10th Shaaban 13bli9th December \ 1932 from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat ) as will be to the Political Resident. ) ) seen, has - after discussion with the Political Agent - drawn up the terms which he is willing to offer to Captain Alban's successor, and pgrees to Captain E.C.H. Iban being appointed. Major Bremner considers the terms are fair and I concur. Instead of a yearly 'leave*, as in the case of his predecessors, the Financial Adviser will - like the Political Agent - go on 'recess'; that is to say he will carry on his work at Karachi. This was one of the suggestions I left with the Political Aent for discussion with His Highness. The only item in the contract that I feel inclined to criticise is that one month's recess will be granted during the first hot weather instead of two. Two months' recess is the minimum if a British Officer is to keep ....7 h -4- k ,«p his health at Muscat, and since it is the same cost to the State in the matter of passages, whether the dviser proceeds on one month or two, and since the Adviser being on recess - not leave - will carry on his work, I do not know why His Highness has put in this clause. However, it is only a small point and I daresay - in practice - His Highness will permit the Mnancial Adviser even in the first hot weather to proceed on two months' recess not o^e. 5. I therefore submit for the favourable consideration of the (government of India that Captain t.C.H. Iban be appointed »,ti Financial Adviser and Commandant Muscat Infantry in succes sion to the present Incumbent of these posts. Should govern ment concur the India Office might be asked to be good enough to get into touch with Captain S.C.H.Alban, whose present address is Naval and Military Club, 94,riccadil y, and if he accepts the terms to arrange for him to sign a contract accordingly. Captain R. 0.

I recommend hi8 leave frem that dittej subject to tltle^ for which he ia aaicing application through the Accountant General, Central Revenues. If his leave is sanctiened, and if Government sanction his re- -empleyment toy the State, he will return to kuscat at the end of December next, or January 1^34. In the interim the State will have to carry on without a Financial Adviser, but will save some Bs. 10,0Q0/- in the pay of the post. Captain Allian has agreed to return before the Kxpiry of his leave should the financial circumstances of the State demand it. His Highness wishes Captain Alban's re-employ- -ment to be for one year. At the end of this period, that is to say in December 1934, His Highness will decide whether to continue Captain Albany services. Major Bremner wishes to proceed on 2^- months 1 leave to Cairo, leaving Muscat at the end of this month. This period is within my power of sanction, and I am pre pared to grant it. I propose that Captain Alban should act as Political Agent in Major Bremner's absence, as he did last year when I proceeded to Bushire as Resident. ^ptain Alban will be able, as he did previously, to xee^ an eye on State finances during the period. 5# Hie Highness is leaving for Dhofar at the end of this month, returning to Muscat about the middle of October. There will thus be a hiatus of about 3^- months between the end of July and the middle of October when neither the buitan nor tne financial Adviser will be in Muscat. The former is constituting a -ouncil to act during his absence, and is of Opinion that this body will be able to exercise sufficient financial control. In the circumstances both l ajor Bremner and I concur. To suiii up. Proposals for sanction of Government are as follows i-(a) that Captain Alban should act as Pslitical Agent during the absence of Major Bremner on leave, b that Captain Alban can proceed on 6 iLonths* leave from the end of July. (c) that on his return his services can be put at the disposal of the Muscat State as Financial Adviser for a further period of one year. 7 * I would be grateful fo# reply by telegram addressed to Bushire and repeated to Political Agent, Muscat. if Government sanction proposals (b) and (c) I would also be grateful if H.M 's.

April 1953. Dear Colonel Loch, I have received a telegram -No.682 dated 13th of karch 1933 from Foreign, New Delhi, sanctioning the proposal regarding my officiating as Political Agent during Major Bremner's absence and subsequently proceeding on 6 months' leave from July. 2. In connection with this/request the favourable considera tion of the Government of India on two points i- (a) That I may be granted an extension of two months to bring the total amount of leave on average pay up to 8 months instead of 6 and (b) that the date of availing mgy be altered to June instead of July. 3, in regard to la), I had agreed, during Colonel iowle s visit here in March, to manage with 6 months leave only, so as to return by the beginning of the next year. 3ix months' leave however, for the purpose of obtaining a thorough change and rest is quite inadequate. Prom Muscat to England and return by P. 8c 0. takes six weeks which would leave me only 4i months in England. From Muscat to England and return via 'Iraq takes about 18 days, I believe, which allows for less than 5 months at home. It is 3i years since I returned from my last leave and this is my fourth summer since then and my third in Muscat without a change, la^t summer having been full^, occupied in carrying out the revenue assessment on the co^at. From the point of view of health and also as a tnorough cl^nge from an isolated and lonely place like this, 6 months is the minimum period which would be worth while taking. 4. As His Highness is likely to be back from Dhofar in September/ The Hon'ble Lt.-Col.G.Looh, Political Resident in the Persian Grulf ,Bu3hire. D.0.No.478.September or October and will be here for the whole of next winter there ia no urgent need for me to hurry back by the beginning of next year. Moreover i cannot discern any financial depression approaching and there seems nothing likely to dis turb the even tenor of our financial progress. The budget for the coming year will, therefore, be a matter of routine and can be prepared in the same way as it was in 1932 by my assistant and checked by me on my return at the end of February or the beginning of March next year. 5. ;/ith regard to ( b) it will not now be necessary for me to wait until July to announce the proposed cuts in the civil list as His Highness has already informed the Regency Council and has left a letter with the Treasury instructing them to bring ^in the revised rates of pay from July 1st. ^othin c more, therefore, remains to be done in this connection as the members / of the Civil List are already aware of the impending change. I desire, therefore, to leave as soon as Major Bremner returns from his leave as I want to enjoy as much of the short English summer as possible before winter comes round again. % 6. I earnestly hope that these two requests may be sanctioned as I feel that I have earned the right to an adequate period of leave. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.} R. Gr. Alban.Copy (original in Town) Visitors Writing Room (not official) AMERICAN EXPRESS, CAIRO, Slat April, 1933. My dear Colonel, I am wondering if you received my letter from Bagdad asking if you had any objection to my stopping in Bagdad on completion of my leave to do a ten day course of Intelligence with the R.A.P. I think it would be extremely profitable for me to do so and I should very much like to. The A.V.M # , I understand, would have no objection. Although it will be damnably hot doing so I propose coming back via Aqaba, Maan, AmmaU and Damascus. Driving across the S4nai Desert in June will be no treat but I have the chance * of learning a lot on that side if I go now as I have a pal in * the S.S.O. at Maan, who would meet me at Akaba v ( he is leaving in August). As that side all reacts on Arab affairs in general, and consequently affects Arab mentality further in our direction I think it is a chance I should not miss. I do^t anticipate being held up inordinately in any way but if there is any prospect of such happening may I apply for an extension of leave to make my leave up to 3 months instead of Zi ? This would bring me back to Muscat by end of June. I would be most grateful if I may do this. I onl^ ask as I think the knowledge gained will be invaluable later.

Muscat, the i9th December ^33 Subject:- Appointment of Financial adviser to . uscat iitate. /p-ii ^ IK '' Uith reference to your No,C/l34 dated lith Novei-ber 1933 forwarding a copy of your 1\ o u+Zl dp. ted lith November 1933 to the address of His Highness the Sultan of ].uscat on the above subject, I have the honour to state that during my recent visit to Bhofar I enquired verbally from His Highness as to the nature of his decision, 2. His Highness stated that he would reply to your letter on his return to Muscat which is scheduled for early February 1934, i.e. shortly after Ramadan. 3. I understand privately from the Sultan that he proposes to abolish the post of Financial Adviser, viiich he regards as an expensive luxury that his State can ill afford at the present juncture, anri to supervise and direct the State finances himself. 4. Under the circumstances it will not therefore be necessary to a^ply for the services of lir. E.C.H.Alban. 5. In view of his experience with Financial Advisers in the past. His Highness 1 views are merely such as were j^ii S. G. P. I.—247 P. A. 4 H. B. M. Consul Muscat—6-12-11 500I't wore anticipated by me and I consider that there is no likelihood of him changing these vievjs, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your mo«t obedient servant, Haj or, i-Qj-itical rvgent oc H.B.ii's Consul, Muscat#SECRET A ^ 1 y&lt;y. c, ^JJU6r -f • j ?«.D€NCY, Ati fou iff/i V ' / V ^L Regarding ray conversation with the Sultan with reference to Alban's successor, it is pretty obvious that His Highness is determined not to have another B.C. for the Job, His conversation may be summed up thus, M My State finances do not permit of my again employing at this juncture a highly salaried B,0 # as financial Adviser and I have decided to lish the post, I will take over the administration of the Finance Department myself, I require however the services of a. Junior officer as Commandant of my Infantry and I will pay him Rs 1000/-P.M, with free house. If circumstances demand my leaving Muscat again for a short time (Note, He does not apparently anticipate being away in the near future for any prolonged period) then I would like this officer to supervise the Financial &lt;( Administration in my absence, ItcK-f 3, He pointed out by the terms of the fresh contract ^ a for the next candidate for the post of Financial Adviser the individual came in on Rs 1200/- P.M. although the terms started at Rs 1000/-, and rose by an annual increment of Rs 100/- to Rs 1500/- P^M. By talcing over the Department himself and merely- keeping a Comraandant of Infantry on Rs 1000/- per mensem he would save Rs 2400/- the first year Rs 3600/- the second year an^/so on up to Rs 6000/- in the last year of the contract, i,e, a total of Rs 16800/- in four years, 4. His argument is certainly very logical but^ apart from this^ I am convinced from our conversation that, although this sum counts considerably with him, he has other d motives as well for the move. He is obviously tired of beinpr ,f boss€ In his own financial affairs and expenditure, particularly when, \ as in some cases, he has never been even consulted, 5, ' Alban 1 s purchase at the cost of Rs 12000/-, of the 'State Armoured Car Is an example In point. The first that the Sultan said he knew of this was when, on his return fromTr.dls last year, he saw fm Item in the Accounts ' advanced to Tessers Herman &amp; Co Rs 5000/-' ' He was daggered, hut It was then too late to stop the order. As a result the State Is saddled with a dead loss of Rs 12000/- and a seven ton monstrosity which Is Incapable of movement other then between Balt-el-velaj and Rule village. The fact obviously rankles In Salyld Said's mind although he Is very polite about It. Such little Incidents as this and the purchase of the Ssldl have I think Impressed on Salyld Said that British Financial Advisers are costly luxuries which he can neither afford nor does he want them. 1 ver T 'tactfully sounded the ground to ascertain if the Sultan contemplated making Duli Chand his Financial Adviser, but as fiar as I can dtvlne 1 think he has not, so far at any rate, contemplated any such idea. S. As regards a solution of the problem I have two suggestions to offer- A. Let the Sultan carry out his wishes and merely engage a British Officer for the Muscat Infantry. If you agree then : would strongly advise applying for deGory, the officer whom I brought to your notice before. Ee would do excellently j think and, being a whole serving officer, would be able to take a little interest in his men other than to slave drive them as coolies. They need both training and raw a little sympathetic care for their wellfare if they are to be of any use for the role that they are supposed to fulfil. They have had neither the one nor the other for some time past. If - the Sultan uses this officer to supervise his finances at any ± time then I think li.H, should give him a small allowance, say Hs 50/- P.M. for doing so. B. If we insist onj( a Financial Adviser then I think we should abandon the idea of a Britisher and employ a British Indian O j icer. I know of one such in the person Major Abdul Samad Shah O.B.E. 1/I6th, Punjab Regiment (You perhaps have heard of him in War days). He has spent the whole of his service in Intelligence, is a man of sensible?ge, of great personal tact and charm, speaks Arabic and Persian fluently and has a personality and character both of which would I think appeal to the Sultan. The fact that he is p . cousin of the Aga. Khan (with whom he is not on very good terms) would not T think militate in any way against his employement here Samad Shah is due to retire in March next on reaching the age limit (49). I think he v/ould fit the role - well and being a man of good family and a Muslim would appeal to the Sultan. ^ • As an alternative I v /ould suggest the name of K.B. Seth Kaikobad of Baluchistan Provincial Service. Ee was done down, when acting in the Politica.1 departments by that unscrupulous rogue Sherbat Khan,(now Political Agent Jibi^ whose crooked policy Kaikobad refused to endorse. Kaikobad xs due to retire shortly and would welcome service in a State. He talks Persian but no Arabic that I know of. Of the two T would prefer Samad Shah but Kaikobad would none the less be very able for the Job having been through the ranks. 9* I am defenitely of the opinion that under the existing circumstances the employement of an Indian of the status of Samad Shah v/ould be the best possible solution. It would help us as v/ell as the State and, being a soldier, Samad Shah could carry on both jobs as of course the State kx cannot afford a Commandant as v/ell. I should think he would willingly come on Hs 1000/- a month as he will also be drawing a small pension from Government# 10. If H.H. wishes to effect economy he can dispense with the services of Duli Chand which will save him Hs 500/- per month. The Sultan I know concluded a contract with Duli Chand before he left for Dhofar. This I got out of him during my recent visit but I am not cognisant of the terms. There appears no reason however why H.H. should not be released from his contract if he wishes. T '/e can always support him in this.11. Meanwhile, as I anticipated, H.H. says he will reply to your letter on the subject when he returns to Muscat, I should be very glad to have your views on the ywte subject as early as possible.

Political Agency &amp; H.B.M's Consulate Muscat,16th January 1936. Major C.E.U.Bremner, M.C., Political Agent &amp; H»B .M f s Consul, Muscat. The Hon r ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 7 Bushire. Subject:- R. S. Dulichand, Director of Revenues, Muscat. Sir, I have the honour to bring to your notice the follow ing facts for such action as you may deem fit. 2. For some considerable time past the conduct of R.3. Dulichand has attracted unfavourable notice. As you are aware, this individual was assistant to the late financial Adviser. On the abolition of the latter post he was appointed Director of revenues and in that capacity he is also head of the State Customs Department, although the post of Financial Adviser has been abolished and His Highness the Sultan has nominally assumed the direction of all Finance, it is beyond doubt that Dulichand is the virtual Financial Director. 3. Free from the direct control of a British Officer, Dulichand has lost no opportunity of asserting his power and influence, neither of which are exerted in the true interests of the State or in co-operation with the British Government. 4. The situation created in the Batinah in November 1933, which was brought to your notice at the time, was entirely due to Dulichand. This situation has in no way been ameliorated and the conditions prevailing on that Co ast, ■■H-2- q.s set forth in my No«C/298 of 17t }i December 1934, are no less attributable to the activities of the Director of Revenues. Shielding himself behind His Highness's authority and availing himself of the protection afforded him as a British subject (which alone prevents him being murdered) Dulichand has driven the poorer inhabitants of the Batinah to despair, whilst a considerable amount of trade from the interior is being diverted elsewhere by his high handed conduct and general treatment of the people - whether Muscati, Omani or British subjects. 6* A continuation of this policy unchecked is bound to have the most disastrous effects ultimately on the State revenues, although at the moment, superficially, all appears well and there is an increase under the various revenue paying heads. 7. Apart from his activities in this direction, but none the less connected with them, there is little room to doubt that Dulichand is actively engaged in intrigues to disintegrate the Ruling Family. As is already well known, the various relations of the Sultan are on exceedingly bad terms with each other. Taking full advantage of this fac^, Dulichand has sought to play off the principals, Saiyid Shah- ab ( n is Highness 1 s representative) and Saiyid Hamad, the Wall of Matrah and to reap the benefit of this dissensions. S. The fact that on the Id-el-Fitr all members of tie Ruling Family (except Saiyid Nadir) and most of the locai. notables and merchants paid their respects to Saiyid Hamad at Matrah, ignoring Saiyid Shahab at the seat of Government, is entirely attributable to the machinations of Dulichand. 9. He is bitterly antagonised to Saiyid Shahab, who was responsible for unmasking him over Batinah affairs in 1933, and v/ho has had repeated cause during the Sultan's present absence, to reprimand the Director of Revenues for exceeding his authority and for otherwise attempting to I-3- meddle in affairs which are not within his Jurisdiction. 10. Dulichand seeks to discredit Saiyid Shahab both to gratify his own revenge and to promote Saiyid Hamad in His Highness's favour. It is to Saiyid Hamad that he looks to afford him a screen for his oppressive activities in the Batinah. 11. Again, having quietly pre-arranged with His Highness for the dismissal of Mr. Thomasj the compounder of the Muscat Infantry, without the consultation of the Commandant of that Corps, Dulichand has contrived to plant a relative or connection of his on the Corps with the style of 'Medical Officer in charge of Muscat Infantry'. The terms of the contract for this indivi dual's employment were drawn up by Dulichand. Again without the Consultation of the Commandant, a most unsuitable Hindu Bannia clerk was to be imposed on the Corps at the direction of Dulichand. The order was however countermanded by Saiyid Shahab on the eve of the clerk's departure from Karachi. Both these matters have formed the subject of correspondence between the Sultan and myself. 13. Having introduced his youthful and wholly inexperienced brother into the Gwadur Customs on Rs 60/- per month in 1933, Dulichand has now promoted him to be Assistant Amin of Customs on RslOO per month, inspite of the general all round reduction in pay and allowances. His ultimate object is alleged to be the removal of the present Superintendent of Customs, ancf individual with 33 years experience to his credit, for the benefit of his brothero 13. In matters connected with British officials in Muscat and with the Naval Contractor, Dulichand spares no efforts to obstruct and to be the cause of constant trouble and annoyance and his general attitude is consistently anti-British e14. To sum up there is no doubt that, free from the superintendance of a British Officer, Dulichand seeks to be the M gower behind the throne' and, by successfully misleading the Sultan, to virtually arrogate to himself supreme authority. 15. His Highness is inordinately satisfied with Dulichand since he produces increasing revenue returns, and a pleasing budget which is purely fictitious. The Sultan places the greatest confidence in him and any complaints received about his Director of Revenues is merely attributed to the jealousy or the personal dislike of the complainants. 16. The continuation of Dulichand in his present position can but lead to the disruption of the Sultan's House and to the ultimate ruination of the liih^ State and its good relations with the British Government. 17. It is under these circumstances that I have seen fit to bring the whole matter to your notftie. . I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.
