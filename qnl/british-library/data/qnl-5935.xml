McPadyen has explained that rock formation in Southern Iraq is not clearly delined and that he hopes to get better understanding of conditions there by study of formations in Koweit. He would like to complete study this summer and to go to Koweit before the greatest heat. I shall therefore be glad to learn as soon as possible whether permission may be obtained.

Shaikh will give permission for cursory visit of individual, but fears it will be futile as rocks are all deeply buried under misleading desert surface. This is result of seismic survey last winter. Obvious most profitable course for Iraq geologist is to write to Kuwait Oil Company Manager to which Shaikh has no objection.

'y dear Colonel, l^ill you please refer to the enclosure to your • Printed Letter No. 535-3 of the 22nd July, 1940, on the subject of the visit of the officers of the Geological Survey of India to the Persian Gulf? 2. While in Kabul I had personal experience of a visit from a Government of India Geologist for I acted as Interpreter to Dr. Pox on his visit to Afghanistan. The days I spent with Dr. Pox I found both interesting and instructive and so should welcome a visit from £ Government of India Geological officer to Kuwait. The Oil and Sulphur companies of Kuwait could not raise any objections, though they look upon Kuwait as their preserve. 3. A great deal of cooperation could not be expected from the commercial geologists, but sufficient to enable a visitor to draw useful conclusions, such as Holmes does, who calls himself a •surface geologist*. This •surface* observation twsrfcB leads Holmes, I believe, to expect the occurrence of barytes here, and early advice, for example, on such a point would be useful.
