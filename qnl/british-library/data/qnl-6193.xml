REPORT ON THE ARMS TRAFFIC. Summary for the 2 Seasons, July 1st 1911 to June 30th 1913. 1. General review. In spite of there having been no relaxation in the measures adopted for try ing to stifle the arms trade in the Gulf, it must be acknowledged that it was more flourishing than ever, up to September 1912 ; after that however the trade declined rapidly. The major part of the trade shifted even still further west in 1912 ; and most landings were effected between Bushire and Lingeh. Consignments were sent overland from Masqat, Sohar and Matrah to Dibai Sharjah and Abu Dhabi and thence shipped across the Gulf. The result was that the tribesmen of Fars armed themselves with, modern rifles, and became quite out of hand. In March 1912, in consequence of a capture by the navy of about 480 rifles, destined for the tribes of Laristan, a large body of tribesmen gathered, and threatened Lingeh. After the attack on the Central India Horse at Kazarun in December 1911 a close blockade was instituted over the Tangistan coast, but this, though diminishing the supply of ammunition, did not wholly suppress it, and rifles and ammui ition we-e sold openly in Shiraz during the summer of 1912. Towards the end of the season 1911-12 the trade became perceptibly brisker, in view of the possible cessation of supply under the new warehouse scheme. Traders wished to get their arms on to the market, before the market was closed. After September, however, when the warehouse regulations came into opera tion, the imports into Masqat fell off considerably. Traders still had large stocks to dispose of, and, as prices rose, they found nakhudas quite willing to take risks. All authorities concerned were agreed, at the end of 1912, that it was impossi ble to relax the blockade measures in any way ; and the sanction of His Majesty’s Government was accorded to their continuance on full scale for 1913-14. At the beginning of 1913 a diminution of gun-running became apparent, and by March stocks of arms m Masqat fell to a very low figure. Afghans also were less inclined, owing to a variety of causes, to venture on the trip to Makran. The Sultan of Masqat co-operated willingly and well in supporting the regulations, and on March 29th the thanks of His.Majesty’s Government were conveyed to him. In June, however, he suffered for his loyalty to Government by being threatened with a serious revolution in ’Oman. British troops were sent to protect Masqat and Matrah on July 9th. 2.

S5GSB2 The amount unaccounted for is necessarily large, for it includes the vast amount absorbed into the interior of Arabia, and large stocks in depots along the Arabian Coast. Again the numbers reported to have been landed are perforce less than the numbers actually landed, and there is also little check on the amounts jettisoned. Some of the rifles and ammunition landed at Masqat are sometimes consign ed to the Shaikhs of Kuwait or Muhammareh, and not, therefore, shown under “ Landings ” or “ Capture ”. 3. The Warehouse at Masqat. The great difficulty encountered in restricting the trade ?t Masqat was the interest which certain French dealers had acquired in it, and French treaties with 'Oman. The following is a brief history of the situation. In 1844, the French concluded a treaty with the Sultan of Masqat, which guaranteed to the French the perpetual right of free imports, subject to maximum customs charges of 5 per cent. In 1862, a declaration was made by the British and French Governments, in which both reciprocally bound themselves to respect the independence of the Sultan of Masqat. In March 1891, an agreement was signed between the British Government and the Sultan of Masqat, under which the Sultan agreed never to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the dominions of Masqat or 'Oman, or any of their dependencies. The Sultan in return was granted an annual subsidy of Us. 86,400. During 1910-11, negotiations were opened between the British and French Governments, with a view to settling certain outstanding difficulties, and on the British side, to terminate the French treaty trade rights at Masqat, under which the French were able to import arms and ammunition without hindrance into Masqat. The French demands, however, proved too great, and included, among other items, the cession of British Gambia in West Africa. The Sultan himself was only too willing to put an end to the contraband trade in Masqat, on any re. ,sonable terms, because it had become a'..perpetual source of worry and annoyance to him, and he was aware that he was being swindled out of the profits which he had expected. The difficulty was to find a way of circumventing vested interests, without infringing French treaty rights. Early in 1911, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf put forward certain proposals. These were, briefly, that the Sultan of Masqat should be given one lakh of rupees down, to compensate him for certain losses incurred by him through the blockade operations; and an increase of one lakh per annum, to his subsidy to cover all possible losses from customs duties, etc., on imported arms. The Sul tan, in return, vrould institute a bonded warehouse system at Masqat, and forbid the importation of arms into any other port in his dominions. All imported arms and ammunition, including existing stocks, to be stored in the Sultan's warehouses, to be marked and registered, and only to be issued to bond iide and authorized purchasets, under the supervision of the Sultan’s own officials, wdio must be approved by the British Government. These regulations would prevent the issue of arms to all destinations, such as Persia, where the import of arms is prohibited, and would kill the illegitimate contraband traffic, which is the source of the profit of the dealers. After lengthy negotiations over many details, this scheme was finally approved, in 1912, by the contracting parties. The Sultan in March 1912 published the rules* for the conduct of the bonded warehouse system, which, it was notified, would come into force from the 1st September 1912. The result of the regulations, if stringently enforced, would be to end the use of Masqat and other ports in 'Oman, such as Sohar, Sur and Matrah, as depots (* See appendix A.)3 and markets for arms. There being few other places where steamers from Europe can unload arms, without being subject to'customs regulations, and where mer chants could sell arms, it was hoped the closing of Masqat would curtail, if not kill, the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. Other ports such as Sharjah, Dibai, Abu Dhabi, Dohah, El Bida’ might replace Masqat to some extent, but the want of good harbours would handicap trade, and the absence of any treaties with European nations would enable Great Britain to bring political or armed pressure to bear on the chiefs concerned. In September 1912, the French Ambassador in London drew the attention of Sir Edward Grey to the notification of the Sultan, which, according to the French view; was a violation of the French treaty rights of 1844. Sir Edward Grey replied that the Sultan of Masqat was an independent ruler, as guaranteed by the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, and that he was, therefore, justified in making his new bonded warehouse rules, which were not for the suppression, but for the regulation of trade within his own dominions. Negotiations were carried on at Paris and in London for an amicable settle ment of the matter ; but at one time it was feared that France might create an incident at Masqat, by sending one of her warships there. To guard against this 3 British men-of-wa^ under the Admiral remained at Masqat during September and October 1912. The British Government refused to agree to pay compensation, unless and until it were so decreed by the Hague Court of Arbitration. France refused to alow her traders to submit to the new regulations and tried to bargain for some important compensation in return for what she said would be a surrender of her treaty rights. She demurred to submitting the question to arbitration, knowing that her support of the nefarious trade was inequitable. Her own overtures to Great Britain about this time, asking us to restrict the entry of arms into West Africa, formed a strange commentary on her attitude at Masqat and also at Jibutil. Apparently M. Dieu in Paris had a vast amount of political power, for the French Government allowed the matter to risk a possible rupture of friendly relations. In November negotiations were resumed on the basis of Great Britain ceding certain rights in Morocco, in exchange for French adherence to the warehouse regulations. These, however, came to nothing. In the meantime French merchants had not deposited their stocks of arms in the warehouse, and the / openly carried on the trade; but new consignments arriving by steamer were passed through the customs to the warehouse. No action was taken with regard to confiscating forcibly French stocks in Masqat. It was feared, about this time, that the French might possibly evade the re gulations by trans-shipping arms into French dhows, in Masqat harbour, without landing them; but this scheme, which would also have defrauded the customs, was not attempted. At the end of January negotiations with France were said to be at a stand still, though the French firms had then changed their attitude, and ceased their agitation, having apparently accepted the situation. In February it was proposed to combine the negotiations regarding Masqat and Jibutil with those regarding the West Coast of Africa ; but France was appar ently ashamed to do so. In March the Government of India was asked its opinion regarding a recti fication of the frontier at Pondicherry, as a compensation to set off against French rights at Masqat. This, however, also failed as a basis. \ The traffic by this time had assumed smaller dimensions owing to the res trictions imposed by the regulations, and there was consequently less pressing necessity for a revision of the French treaty of 1844.The French Government continued to press for compensation to the French traders involved, and in June Sir E. Grey was inclined to agree in principle to in connection with an adjustment of the Wadai frontier in A^est Africa. The revision of the treaty was to be postponed sine die. 4. Afghans. About 1,200 Afghans, under Khalifa Khair Muhammad, remained in Makran in 1911, after the Makran expedition (see Appendix B), keeping well away from the coast. These men had large sums in deposit with ’Ali Khan, the principal arms-dealer in Masqat, and they stayed throughout the hot weather (1911) in Makran, partly in the hope of getting their deposit refunded, and partly in order to collect arms through various Baluch middlemen. They suffered greatly from the climate, and several of them died in Makran ; while the operations of the Field Force showed that the “Sarkar” had a long arm. The blockade was now strict, and the winter of 1911-12 was an unprofitable one to the Afghans and Pathans, and hardly any new ventures were made from Afghanistan to southern Persia. Khalifa Khair Muhammad eventually approached the Intelligence Officer at Jask, and promised to leave Makran, and abandon the arms traffic, if he could get back a reasonable proportion of the money deposited at Masqat. After much bargaining Major Craufurd succeeded in arranging with Ali Khan at Masqat for the return of about Us. 65,000 to the Afghans. This left another Rs. 70,000 still lying at Masqat belonging to other Afghans. The residue of the Afghans, numbering only some 60 to 80 , the others having dispersed previously, re turned to Afghanistan in the spring of 1912, and though they were individually armed, they carried no large consignment of rifles. They had suffered severe hardships, had found the game not worth the candle owing to increased risks, and had to be satisfied with losing considerable sums over the transactions. About £40,000 of this was disbursed to the Afghans at Karachi in February 1913. Other small caravans of 10 to 25 men were reported in Laristan and Makran in January to April 1912 ; but their ventures do not appear to have been very successful. Latterly, owing partly to the inferior brand of cartridges obtainable with the small-bore rifles, and partly owing to the preference for cartridges which can be re-loaded, the popularity of the *450 Martini-Henry has increased in Afghanistan and along the North-West Frontier. From 1st April 1911 to 18th July 1911, 22,800 rifles reached Kabul from the Gulf. In addition to these, other rifles reached the Kandahar market during 1911, and some went direct to the North-W est Frontier. Of these 22,800 rifles, whic h reached Kabul, it is known that the following were disposed of North-West Frontier Pathans .. 3,240 Mohmands .. • • 3,000 Kohistanis .. • • 2,000 Afghan Turkistan .. C . 3,700 Bajour.. • • • • .. 1,100 Khost . • • • •- • • • 600 Hazarajat •• • •- • • • .. 1,600 Total ... 15,240 The rifles which reached Afghanistan with the kafilehs, which returned during the spring of 1911, were mostly rifles which had been imported into Makran in previous years, including a good many bought up from the Baluchis.5 l^rom figures which have been collected it may be estimated that the following approximate numbers of rifles have reached Afghanistan, via southern Persia. No accurate estimate is possible :— Year. Numbers. 1900 .. .. .. .. .. 200 1901 •. .. •. 500 1902 .. — 500 1903 .. 1,000 1904 5,000 1905 .. 10,000 1906 • • 10,000 1907 30,000 1908 40,000 1909 • • 40,000 1910 .. 30,000 1911 27,800 1912 2,000 1913 (up to end of June) .. •• • • .. 2,400 Total 199,400 In spite of Khalifa Khaix Muhammad's promises to desist from the trade he continued to encourage Afghans to come to Makran, and helped them to obtain rifles. During the winter of 1912-13, however, only small parties of Afghans were to be found in Makran, and it is questionable whether, at any one time, there were more than 50 in the country, engaged in the arms traffic. Several caravans, which possibly were chiefly concerned with legitimate trade, managed to pick up large numbers of rifles in the country round Bandar 'Abbas and Lingeh, especially in Lar, and some actually busied themselves in collecting arms round Yazd and Kirman. The Afghans had outstayed their welcome in Makran, and occasionally were badly handled by the inhabitants. Some of the Makran Sardars also, partly from fear of the British Government, discouraged the traffic in arms. A rumour, to the effect that the British Government intended to use aeroplanes, also tended to alarm the Afghans. 5. Blockade Measures. The following measures were actually employed for the suppression of the arms trade :— (a) Five of His Majesty’s ships and 4 launches, also R. I. M. S. “ Minto ”, were maintained in the Gulf. (b) The location of J a battalion with 2 machine guns near Robat. (c) Intelligence officer at Jask, and later a naval intelligence officer at Masqat. (d) Wireless installation at Jask and Rishahr. (e) Patrols by the Indo-European Telegraph Department line guards. (/) The deputation of Mr. Gregson of the Indian Police, with an adequate staff, to efiect measures for stopping the passage by steamer of arms-traders to the Gulf from Indian ports ; (g) the reinforcement of the telegraph station guards at Jask and Chahbar and other places, and the placing in a state of defence of the above two telegraph stations, which the Afghans had threatened to attack.

For the year ending 31st March 1913 the Government of India advanced to the Admiralty the sum of £64,000 When H. M. S. Espie le went to Aden temporarily in 1913, the cost of ’coal consumed by her was debited to Indian revenues. The main item of Army charges are on account of the maintenance of the garrisons m the Persian Gulf and at Robat (Kacha), and the cost of the expedition to the Makran coast in 1910 and 1911. r The whole of the cost of the arms traffic blockade is debitable to Indian revenues. The total cost in 1912-13, as far as known at the end of June 1913 was Rs. 19,66,72o and the estimate for 1913-14 was Rs. 25,00,500. In February 1912, when the trade spread further up the Gulf, the Home Government were asked to share the expense of the extra measures necessitated * but as the matter involved the consideration of the adequacy of the Indian naval subsidy, the request was not pressed. 6. Naval Measures. Out of a fleet of 9 ships, the East Indies Squadron maintainted five shins permanently m the Persian Gulf, for blockade operations, in addition to providine personnel for 4 armed launches, the Harold, Karanja, Mashona, and MiLr. ThS . I. M S. Mmto acted as parent ship to these launches. Sometimes the men- of-war had cutters down to help blockad 5 certain points.

Peirse took over com mand of the East Indies Squadron from Rear Admiral Sir A. E. Bethell. ,, Traders were becoming much more careful latterly in running cargoes across the Gulf and seldom committed a large number of rifles to any one dhow. A few rifles, with small amounts of ammunition, were hidden away in false keels hollow beams, or packages of ordinary cargo. When these methods of concealment were found ovt mkhuias’ took to jettisoning the arms on sighting a manmf war sometimes attaching a float, which they could pick up later? § of - w ar, The results achieved by the Navy were as follows : - 1911-12 1912-13.

M.'s ships were concentrated at Masqat to watch the Working of the warehouse regulations. At this time many d ow s seized the opportunity to run cargoes of arms across, and though some actually sailed from Masqat, H. M/s ships were not permitted to interfere with them m Masqat waters. On January 31st 1913 it was reported that a cutter with 9 men under Lieu tenant Smith from H. M. S. Perseus had disappeared, and it was feared that it had been lost in a gale. On February 1st the Admiralty announcsd that a rumour had reached Lingeh that a Tangistani dhow with rifles on board had met a warship (?) south of Halul Island, and had shot the officer in charge. Up to June no further clue had been obtained. In May, as the contraband trade in the Persian Gulf was not brisk, H. M. S. Espiegle was transferred to Aden temporarily. In June 1913 the Navy undertook operations against a portion of the Tangis- tan Coast, which was responsible for a piracy on a Dibai boat in August 1911. The operations commenced on the 14th June, and were completed on the 24th June. The village of Madumari was the first objective. After the viflaga had been shelled, a landing was effected, in the face of some opposition, to launch or destroy the dhows belonging to the village. One seaman was killed and 5 wounded in the landing. ^ As villagers from Dilvar took part in the opposition on this occasion their village was next attackd, by a combined force of 230 men of the 2nd Rajputs and 200 men from the ships. While the village was being demolished, the cover ing party was subjected to a heavy fire from hostile riflemen numbering 350, of whom 100 were mounted. There were no British casualties. On June 24th some dhows were removed from Khur Khuvair. Altogether 20 dhows were destroyed and 11 taken to Kharag Island to be held to ransom. 7. Military Measures. The Military measures employed included the following (a) The location of half a battalion with 2 machine guns at Kacha, near Robat, for the interception of any caravans passing through British Baluchistan. r &amp; &amp; (b) The location of detachments, as under, in the Persian Gulf Jask about 200 rifles and 2 machine guns, Chahbar 50 „ 2 „ „ Bandar Abh.s 13 „ 1 &gt;&gt; »&gt; Lingeh 10 Basidu 7 In March 1913 the garrisons of Jask and Chahbar were reduced to 40 and 30 respectively, the headquarters of the battalion and surplus men being sent to Bushire. &amp; -The detachments at Bandar Abbas and Lingeh are virtually consular guards but together with the other 3 detachments the cost of their accommodation is debitable to the arms traffic. The guard at Basidu, in April 1913, was transferred from there to Hanjam, as the latter place had been made the naval coal depot. On October 22nd 1912 a detachment of the 7th Duke of Connaught’s Own Rajputs from Jask chased a party of Jxarwanis, who had landed with arms on the coast. The Rajputs overtook the party and contributed to the capture of the arms, which was actually effected by a party of villagers. In June 1913 about 230 of the 2nd Rajputs from Bushire took part, with the Navy, in operations on the Tangistan Coast.On two or three other occasions the troops at Jask and Chahbar were utili7ed for protecting the consulates at Bandar ’Abbas and Lingeh, when these were threat ened by large bands of raiders. 8. System of Intelligence. A General Staff Officer, 3rd grade, with his headquarters at Jask, was employed in collecting information, which he passed to the Navy; he also submitted a weekly or bi-weekly diary to the General Staff, Simla, with copies to the Senior Naval Officer and the Political Resident. In 1912 the Navy also maintained an officer on intelligence work at Masqat, but the appointment was discontinued early in 1913. Major S. G. Craufurd, D.S.O., was Intelligence Officer, Jask, from 1910 to April 1913, when Major C. C. R. Murphy, 30th Punjabis, took over from him. Other sources of information were the Telegraph Superintendents at Jask and Robat (Dehaneh Baghi), the Vice-Consuls at Lingeh and Bander ’Abbas, the Political Agents, Masqat, Bahrain and Kuwait. The General Staff at Simla collected all the information from the various sources and, after having it printed, distributed it about once a week to the follow ing :— 1. Agent to the Governor General, North-West Frontier Province. *2. Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan. 3. Foreign Department. 4. Mr. E. G. Gregson, C.I.E. 5. Political Resident m the Persian Gulf. 6. Political Agent, Masqat. 7. Director, Criminal Investigation Department. 8. Naval Commander-in-Chief. 9. Intelligence Officer, Jask. 10. Intelligence Officer, Peshawar. 11. Vice-Consul, Bandar ’Abbas. 12. General Staff, IVth (Quetta) Division. The General Staff also kept running statistics showing— (a) the strength and location of any arms trading caravans of Afghans, and the arms reaching Afghanistan. (b) The amounts of arms captured, confiscated or jettisoned. (c) The arrivals of cargoes of arms at Masqat with, when possible, the names of the exporters and importers. (d) The distribution of arms from Masqat and Arabia. (e) The landings reported on the Coast of Persia. 9. Police Measures. The measures adopted by Mr.^ Gregspn and his staff of police included the follow ing : they resulted in a great diminution and almost a cessation of the attempts to trade direct, which were being made by Ghilzais (Kharotis) and Adam Khels, the chief offenders among Pathans :— (a) All Pathan tribes were kept informed of the prohibition against indulg ing in the trade, and they were given to understand that, unless they desisted, they might be refused admission to British India even to carry on ordinary trades, and might be deprived of the assistance of British Consuls in Persia. (b) Steamers and boats leaving Karachi, Bombay, Baluchistan, Kathiawar etc., were watched.(c) Informers were sent into Afghanistan to ascertain intended plans, (d) All steamers plying to the Gulf were patrolled and Pathan arms traders, if caught, were sent to Dera Ismail Khan jail. (e) Pilgrims to Baghdad were escorted by police officers to see that they were bond fide, for the Pathan was always ready to try and slip past in disguise as a pilgrim. (/) Information was supplied to the naval and military intelligence officers, and interpreters were provided for the naval authorities. These measures were eminently successful, a statement borne out by the rise in price of arms on the frontier, and by the increase of rifle thefts in India. The following confiscations were made on ships trading in the Gulf, chiefly through the police, patrols :—■ Arms. Ammunition. 1911- 12. .. .. 68 .. .. 11,276. 1912- 13 66 .. .. 1,430. 10. Other measures of suppression suggested but not adopted. Mr. Gregson’s suggestion .—On June 7th 1911 Mr. Gregson suggested the fol lowing measures in order to avoid the expense of keeping th 3 navy continuously employed on the blockade :— (a) Strengthening the line guard 'of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment by 150 men, to form a levy corps for coast guard’s work. (b) Two outposts at Sadaich and Galag holding 50 iren each, and lines at Jaskand Chahbar to accommodate 25 men each. A wireless installation at Sadaich and Chahbar. The troops at Jask and Chahbar and the Makran levies at Jiunri to co-operate. At sea 4 ships of 100 tons each, and maximum speed of 15 knots with wireless and water distilling apparatus. (/) For Biaban, where there is no telegraph line, a local arrangement with the chiet of Kuhistak and Sirik. (c) (d) (e) The General Staff considered that four preventive boats would be insufficient to watch the coast from Gwatar to Lingek (500 miles), and that the crews were too small to deal with landings ; also that the efficiency of the land measures was doubtful. Though the measures were inadequate at the time, they might help to prevent smuggling in Makran after the main arms trade had been killed. The Admiral considered that the cost of the small ships would be more than Mr. Gregson thought, but he approved the land measures. Sir P. Cox thought the measures were based on a wrong hypothesis, and sup ported Major Webb-Ware’s suggestion of a line guard at Dehaneh Baghi; but con sidered that if, the Telegraph line were extended to Minab, with telegraph levies along it, and a consul were placed at Bampur with a strong escort, we could per manently keep Makran out of mischief, and prevent Afghans reaching the coast. Mr. Gregson’s suggestion was not adopted as there were political objections to increasing the number of line guards, and to placing outposts at Sadaich and Galag, while the extension of the telegraph to Minab, though within our rights, appeared to be an expensive method of saving expenditure on the navy. The Admiral’s suggestion .—In May 1912 the Admiral stated that the trade had lately revived, and that though only carried on in a modified form with the Makran coast, it was spreading in a manner very difficult to deal with in the Persian Gulf, and imports into Masqat were increasing. The Admiral proposed that four more launches, in addition to the four ships and four launches already employed, should be used after October 1912, that the wireless stations be established as soon as possible; and that a warehouse be placed at Sohar as well S5GSBas Masqat. The decision regarding four more launches was postponed, arrange ments for the wireless tebgraphic scheme were expedited, and the question of a warehouse at Sohar was referred to the Political Resident, who apparently con sidered it unnecessary. In November 1912 the Resident, Bushire, suggested that when a dhow was captured, in addition to the dhow being burnt, the nakhuda should be imprisoned in India for 6 months unless able to pay a heavy fine ; and that the crews should be subjected to the punishment of whipping. With the exception of the latter, the suggestion was adopted. 11. Persia (General). The Persian Government has delegated to the British Navy the task of taking measures on the sea to prevent arms traders from smuggling arms into Persian territory. They themselves have customs officials at the chief ports, but there is no preventive service along the intervening coast. The Persian Government even welcomed the British expedition to Makran in 1911 (see Appendix) ; and in June 1913 offered no objection to the naval punitive measures against the Tangistan Coast. On the 17th January 1913 the Resident, Bushire, was informed that instruc tions had been issued to the Southern Customs by the Persian Government not to allow British importers of arms to take delivery of consignments without a “ no objection ” certificate from the British Consul. These instructions had been asked for owing to the case of a British firm having refused to disclose the name of the consignee. On March 8th 1913 the Persian Government being pressed thereto by His Majesty's Government wrote and asked the Sultan of Masqat to expel any Persian subject who went to Masqat territory with the object of buying arms. The Sultan agreed and, a month or two later, took action in accordance with the request. {a) Central Persia. On March 4th 1913 it was reported from Tehran that certain Afghans from Quetta, who claimed to be British subjects, were engaged in distributing arms in the \azd and Isfahan provinces, and were causing some trouble there. They were warned that they would be deprived of British protection, if they did not desist. ^ A large infiltration of arms was said to be taking place in the provinces of Kirman, \ azd, and Isfahan ; but it was not known whence. (6) Arabistan and Pars. Small depots of arms are kept in the Arabistan, Tangistan and Dashti ports. Ihe owners of some of these depots reside in Bushire, and purchase arms through dalals. Duimg the six months ending January 1913 it was computed that about l,8a0 rifles had been landed upon the Arabistanand Pars coasts, most of them having come rom the direction of Qatar. In April 1913 it was reported that a consign- men of 20,000 rounds of ammunition had lately been despatched into the interior from Rudhilleh. The only trade centre from which the Bakhtiari obtain their arms is Ram Hormuz, which place is supplied from Falahieh, Ma’shur and Hindian. A few are also said to find then way by land, round the north of the Gulf, from Kuwait. It is estimated that about 200 rifles are sold annually in Ram Hormuz, which is less than the amount that used to be sold there about two years ago. The Bakh tiari have recently been able to import rifles from the north of Persia. The Kuhgalu obtain their arms from Bandar Dilam, as well as from Hindian and Bandar Ma shur, and also from Behbehan.

These were (c) Shibkuh Coast. arms landed in the Lingeh district was 2,760 against imported chiefly by Ivazi and Lari merchants, whosend small boats across to agents. There was a ready sale for good rifles among the Arab tribes of Laristan and in Tangistan, while many rifles found their way into the hands of Afghans, who bought in Yazd and Lingeh, but chiefly in Lar. The Shaikhs of Charak and Mughu were the worst offenders in allowing their subjects to carry on the illicit trade. In October 1912, the trade increased on the Shibkuh Coast, as His Majesty’s ships were detained at Masqat. In March and April 1913, there was a distinct falling off in landings on the Shibkuh coast. This was attributed partly to the depletion of stocks in Masqat and partly to the prevalence of plague on the Shibkuh coast. (d) Makran. In the autumn of 1910, when the monsoon was over, the smuggling operations recommenced and the blockade measures were continued. During the winter of 1910-11 it was estimated that there were over 3,000 well armed Afghans and Pathans in Makran. To check this recrudescence of activity, the following force was mobilized on 29th March 1911 (see Appendix B):— 104th Wellesley’s Rifles. 2 Sections, 32nd Mountain Battery. 2 Sections, No. 19 Company, 3rd Sappers and Miners. 2 Sections, No. 11 Indian Field Ambulance. These troops were embarked on two ships, R. I. M. S. Northbrook and Hardinge, which sailed from Bombay on 7th April. On the 10th April the whole force, together with a party of marines from H. M. S. Highflyer, disembarked at Galag on the Makran coast, and was joined by the principal local Baluch chiefs. The force advanced up the valley of the Rapch river to Barkaban. On 16th April, Colonel Delamain, with 90 men mounted on mules, pushed on to Bint. The Afghans retreated northwards. The whole force re-embarked on 21st April, and, on 25th April, disembarked at Sirik on the Biaban coast, to capture some arms which had just been landed there, for Barkat Khan, a local Baluch, who was assisting the Afghan arms-traders. On 28th April, the force attacked the Pushak defile, which was held by about 160 followers of Barkat Khan. After a sharp engagement the enemy were driven off. One British officer and three men of the 104th Rifles were wounded. The enemy’s losses were estimated at 8 killed and 24 wounded. Forty rifles and 40,000 rounds of ammunition were recovered out of the consignment landed at Sirik. The force was re-embarked on 8th May, and returned to India. The moral effect of these operations was considerable. The Afghans were discouraged, and the local Baluch chiefs understood the inadvisability of parti cipating openly in the illicit arms traffic. The Afghans’ pecuniary losses were greater during 1910-11 even than their losses during the previous year. The bulk of them invested their available cash in rifles and ammunition bought up from the Baluchis, and returned to their homes. In November 1911 four Afghans buying arms in Dashtiari were arrested and handed over to the military at Chahbar. Among other measures adopted for the suppression of trade in arms in Makran is the system of levies to local Sardars, nominally for protecting the telegraph line. Islam Khan of Bint and Saiyid Khan of Geh are recipients of these sub sidies, and in return they are expected to discourage the visits of Afghans to their territories. In January 1913, however, Mr. Gumbley finding that Islam Khan had not carried out his share of the compact, withheld the additional subsidy for the half year ending 30th September 1912. In April 1913, Islam Khan retaliated by robbing the telegraph line-man at Balak. He was accompanied by Mir Barkat in this raid and between them they had a following of 300 men, including 25 Afghans.Mir Barkat, an old 'offender in encouraging the trade in arms, had in Sep tember 1911, and again in October 1912, tried to get reinstated as joint governor with Mir Haji, of Biaban, and finally he accepted our conditions. In June 1913, the Persian Government officially reinstated him in his post. The chief culprits in fostering the arms trade on the Makran coast are the inhabitants of Karwan, near the mouth of the Bapch River. The Afghans interested come as far as Fanuch, or Bint, where they are assisted by Khalifa Khair Muhammad. Most arms landed in Makran recently (1913) appear to be consigned to Bint. 12. Turkey in Asia. On March 23rd 1913, Major Craufurd reported that the Hamburg-Amerika line were said to have landed 2 consignments of arms at Basrah without any hin drance on the part of the Turkish authorities. These arms were apparently being passed through to the various Arab tribes. 13. Arabia. There is a large demand for arms and ammunition from all the Arab tribes in Arabia, including central Arabia, and from the Persian tribes of southern and south-western Persia. There has therefore been a constant tendency for the ex tension of the exports from Masqat to those regions, and this explains the con tinuance of large imports into Masqat, in spite of the fact that the main volume of the trade to Makran and to Afghanistan, formerly the great markets, has been restricted for some time by the blockade operations. It is estimated also that the crews of the pearling fleets, to protect them selves against piracy, carried 10,000 rifles during 1912, It was suggested that they should be made to take out licenses. 4 Large consignments of arms are now sent by land, across the Oman peninsula,.' and various subsidiary depots exist all along the Arabian coast, from Kuwait to Oman. These depots are kept stocked by the numerous pearling and trading dhows. From the Arabian coast, cargoes of contraband arms are run across to the Persian coast. During August 1912, it is estimated that the dealers at Masqat sent 17,000 rifles and about 10 million rounds of ammunition, and during September about 4,000 rifles, to their subsidiary depots along the Batinah coast. In August 1912, dealers had the following depots in Arabia :— {a) Sur, Sohar, and other places along the Batinah Coast. {b) Inland depots, such as Baraimi, Nizwa’, Awabi, Bid bid, in the Hinter land of ’Oman. (c) Sharjah, Dibai Abu Dhabi, and other places along the Pirate Coast. d) Dohah, Wakra, and other places in the Qatar peninsula. (c) Minor depots, such as Qasr-us-Subaih, whose status is doubtful. The arms from these depots, presuming the blockade is maintained, will gra dually be absorbed in Arabia, where British interests are not in danger for^the moment. * s In June 1913, it was thought, according to the Pioneer, that one effect of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement in respect of the Arabian coast in the Persian Gulf would be to check the arms traffic that still goes on in that quarter. The rifles and ammunition that are now sent from Masqat to El Qatar and other parts of the coast would find no port to receive them, and traders would be driven to use inland caravan, routes, but these can only serve the interior of Arabia. Trade with the Persian littoral will be stopped, and trucial chiefs will have no further hand in it. (a) Kuwait. In 1911, despite the Shaikh’s express orders prohibiting importation of arms many attempts were made. On July 24th a shipment, avowedly of sugar, wasdiscovered to contain arms through the accidental breaking of a case in Kuwait harbour, anl was condscatel by the Captain. Another attempt at smuggling was discovered at Bombay. Both consignments came from Antwerp. (See Appendix C.) The imports of arms and ammunition into Kuwait, in 1912-13, by steamer, increased in v. lue by one lakh of rupees. These large amounts were imported by the Shaikh and others on special permits. The Shaikh had agreed to receive no arms except such as had passed through the Masqat warehouse, and were stamped with the official mark. The imports into Kuwait for the last 3 years were as follows :&gt; Year. 1910-11 Value. f Rs. 5,810 lbs. 1,55, 55,200 Country of origin. United Kingdom Rs. 1,03,470 United Kingdom .Rs. 51,730 France Remarks. by steamer by baghaleh. 1911-12 Rs. 42,000 France by steamer 1912-13 Rs. 1,47,500 Rs. 1,500 .. United Kingdom Rs. 1,46,000 .. France by steamer Exports .*—By baghaleh. 1910-11, Rs. 30,750 to the Persian coast. f * There is no export by steamer, and there has been no import or export by baghaleh since 1911. (6) Qatar. Qatar was the centre of a large arms traffic. Apart from the wholesale trade, rifles were said to be more or less openly on sale in some dozen and a half shops in Do hah bazaar. In October 1911 Shaikh Jasim bin Thani, when being asked to assist in the suppression of the trade, declined, saying the trade did not exist. Qatar is the only territory on the Persian Gulf of which the ruler has not notified a prohibition on the import of arms: it is therefore a dangerous place. According to the agreement with Turkey, drafted at the beginning of 1913, Turkey renounces any claims to suzerainty. This will enable the British Government to treat direct with the Shaikh, who is now Abdullah, lately governor of Dohah, his father having died in May 1913. In March 1913, in spite of the fact that large numbers of arms had been imported the previous year, there were no large stocks of arms remaining unsold. It was said that in Qatar there was an annual demand for 2,000 rifles. (c) Trucial Coast. The attitude of the Shaikhs with regard to the trade is apathetic, due no doubt to their fear of retribution from arms-traders. Early in August a consignment of arms was captured from a Tangistani dhow when in the act of loading near Dibai, but the crew, who escaped, wreaked its vengeance on a pearling boat from Dibai, and got off scot free. The Shaikh was suitably rewarded for capturing these 400 odd rifles with ammunition. It was on account of this piracy that the Tangistan villages were punished in June 1913, by the Itoyal Navy. In 1912, reports were received that arms-traders were bringing their caravans actually into the towns of Dibai, Sharjah, and Ajman, though the chiefs of these places professedly forbade it. In September 1912, a clever capture of an arms caravan was made by the son of the British Residenc Agent near Sharjah. He secured 839 arms and 134,000 rounds of ammunition. These arms were later on reported to have been destined for the Shaikh of Qatar. They were all confiscated, and the caravan men were imprisoned. The Shaikh of Sharjah received a rebuke and a warning for having failed to assist. S5GSB(^) Masqat For an account of the Arms Warehouse, etc., see Section 3. - Shivyinq .—Masqat has continued to be the only port at which ocean-going steamers have regularly unloaded cargoes of arms and ammunition Since Sep tember 1912, however, only 6 ships have landed any consignments and the major part of such consignments were intended for persons legally entity to import During a similar period of the previous year (1911-12), 17 ships landed arms »t Masqat. i'H In 1911-12, according to the Consular report, the figures of imports of arms showed an increase of £51,380 over the previous year’s figures of £68,075. § The following figures were furnished by the principal French arms-trader Rifles, Number. Value. Belgium ''U .. France Germany United Kingdom United States .. 3,500 5.000 7.000 14,000 205 £ 5,750 £ 5,500 £ 49,000 £ 36,300 £ 900 Total.. •• 29,705 97,450 Ammunition.

French arms, which go through Antwerp, figure in the Belgian returns. The increase under Belgium is therefore not surprising. * German shipping of Masqat profited over British shipping in 1911: the actual figures for the steamer trade of 1911 being :— Rs. In German bottoms .. . . .. . . .. 10,50,360 In British bottoms .. .. .. .. .. 5,12,770 Giving a total greater than that of the previous pear by .. 6,20,550 (Persian Gulf Administration Report 1911.) Dealers. —The arms warehouse regulations came into force on September 1st and all native dealers, but not French dealers, deposited their stocks in the ware house. Some arms, which had arrived per S. S. Ekbatana the previous day, and were still in the customs, were also passed into the warehouse. Dealers in England, Laubenburg, Kynoch, and Clayborough and Johnstone comp'ained in November 1912 regarding the losses they had incurred. They were, however, informed that a warning had been issued in March 1912, and the rules communicated to the Press in June 1912, giving ample time to prevent further shipments. In December 1912, Menasche, the French agent and dealer at Masqat, applied for permission to reship some of the arms and ammunition detained in the•warehouse to Jibutil or Europe. Permission was granted, and he despatched a large consignment in May. In doing so he managed to deceive the warehouse authorities, and substituted some old worthless stuff, retaining some of the newer arms for sale. In December the firm of Mr. Goguyer, French arms-dealer, was closed. In March 1913 there were said to be no Mauser, Lee-Enfield, or Lee-Metford rifles left for sale in Masqat. Even the French had exhausted their stock of small bore rifles, and only had Martinis and Werndls. Martini ammunition, for which there had been much demand among the Arabs, was also exhausted : Rs. 20 per 100 was being offered for it. ’Ali Musa Khan was said to be intending to abandon the arms trade and adopt the more lucrative trade of rice. In March 1913 a certain Armenian, Amin Azmirlian, connected with America , was reported to be looking for an opening to sell American rifl s in the Gulf. As the United States have certain treaty rights at Masqat the contingency of their establishing such a trade was serious. Rebellion, 2915.—Towards the end of May 1913 a rebellion broke out in the interior of ’ Oman, against the Sultan, because of his adherence to the arms ware house regulations, and the consequent restriction of entry of arms into ’Oman. Through his previous encouragement of the nefarious trade, he had been gradually raising up trouble for himself. In his extremity he appealed to the British Govern ment for help. They sent a detachment from Bushire just in time to prevent the rebels entering Masqat, for they had advanced without opposition to within 35 miles of the town. These rebels have captured large depots of arms in the interior, namely Nizwa, where Ali Khan had 700 rifles and 300 cases of ammunition, Nakhl, where both Ali Khan and Saiyid Yusuf had large stocks, Nafa and Samail. 14. Gulf of Aden. Jibutil continued to be an entrepot of arms chiefly destined for Abyssinia&gt; Soudan, and Somaliland, and the French Government took no effective steps to put a stop to it. South coast of Arabia—On 19th February 1913 the Admiral reported that he had ordered H.M.S. Espiegle to Aden to cope with the arms traffic on the Arabian and Somali coasts. Apparently Mokalla had become an arms depot, arms being brought from Masqat in Suri dhows, and distributed to Somaliland in Warsangeli and Mijjertain dhows. At Mokalla arms were said to be sold openly in the bazar, 100 rifles being available (retail) at any time. Ammunition was fetching Rs. 22 per 1,000 rounds. Other ports of South Arabia, e.g., Shahr and Shukra, also engaged in the trade. On May 5th HM.S. Espiegle was withdrawn from Aden to Colombo. During the 2j months which she had been in Aden waters she had cruised about continually, visited the ports where arms were likely to be run, and searched all suspicious dhows ; but no captures were made. 15. Importers at Masqat. The importers of arms in Masqat were :— Louis Dieu (represented by Menasche) | French traders. A. Goguyer (represented by Ibrahim Elbaz) ) Haji ’Ah Khan bin Musa Khan. W. J. Towell and Co. (shipping agent). Dhamodar Dhurmsey. A. R. Ja’afar. M. ’Abbas. J. Baijeot and Company. Of these Louis Dieu was by far the largest importer, being responsible for about half of the imports from Great Britain, and probably for a still larger proportion ofthe imports from Antwerp. Goguyer made no large ventures, though he received small consignments fairly regularly. ’Ali Khan was the second largest importer. Messrs. Towel 1 and Company imported only for legitimate destinations such as the Shaikh of Kuwait, and did no retail selling. Either Menasche or Tbrahim Elbaz acted as agents at Masqat to all British exporters (there were no British agents engaged in the trade). 16. Exporte is from Europe. During the year 27 ships arrived at Masqat with consignments of arms ; of these 9 sailed from Antwerp or Hamburg, and consequently it was impossible to ascertain the names of the exporters. The others sailed from Manchester (10), London (6) and Grimsby (2) and the customs declarations were received. The chief exporters in Great Britain were :— Clay borough and Johnstone : —'Bifles and ammunition, Birmingham. Kynochs, Ltd., Witton.—Ammunition only. C. H. Laubenburg and Company.—Rifles and ammunition, Birmingham. The Midland Gun Company.—Ammunition. Brimingham Metals and Munitions Company.—-Ammunition. Birmingham Small Arms Company.—Rifles. Other exporters included the London Small Arms Company, and Times Dhar- war and Company, London. Foreign exporters have managed to cloak their identity by a system of secret agencies, but there is no doubt that Louis Dieu is responsible for the majority of shipments to Masqat. (See Appendix C.)

In January 1912, Mausers without ammunition, were being sold in Masqat for Rs. 200 and at Bushire for Rs. 212. In Lar the price dropped from Rs. 225 to Rs. 185. On the Makran coast the following prices ruled :— Rs. Rs. Martini rifles 80 Mauser rifles 400 Lee-Metford rifles 300—400 ,, carbines 300 In July 1912 300 Werndls were sold at Matrah for Rs. 1-8-0 each. This was at a time when traders were trying hard to get rid of their stocks. After September 1912 prices rose rapidly. In January 1913 the prices of ammunition in Masqat rose from about Rs. 10 per 100 rounds to Rs. 15. Rifles which used to be sold at Rs. 75, fetched Rs. 150. In January 1913 nakhudas were askingJ-Rs. 30 per rifle to induce them to undertake the risk of running a cargo of arms across. The prices near Bushire in February 1913, including transit dues levied by chiefs and agent, were :— Rs.

The price of ammunition had risen more in proportion than the price of rifles ; 100 rounds of small-bore ammunition in February 1913 cost about Rs. 20 loose, or Rs. 25 in clips in Bushire. In Masqat the price of Martini-Henry ammunition-was about the same price, i.e. y Rs. 20. On March 17th, 1913, it was reported from Quetta that in Western Afghanistan, and the whole of the Baluch tracts, the price of ammunition had risen rapidly in the g5GSBpast two years. This rise coincided with a rise noticed in the tribal hinterland beyond the North-West Frontier. The modern rifles supplied by the gun-runners to the tribesmen take cartridges, which cannot be got from the Afghan arsenals, or stolen in India, and hence the question of regular supplies is a difficult one. In June 1913 cartridges, on the Isfahan-Kuchan road, had risen from Rs. 20 to Rs. 35 per 100. Kabul 'prices .—In June 1911, the prices in Kabul were as follows:— Rs. Martini-Henry, with 60 rounds .. .. .. •• *&gt;• 130 Cheap trade patterns of Mauser and Mannlicher, with 30 rounds .. 250 The details of Kabul prices are imperfect, but it is believed that a modern Mauser or Mannhcher with 50 rounds is sold for about Rs. 400, and a Lee-Metford for about Rs. 450. The tribesmen of the North-West Frontier will still pay Rs. 700 to Rs. 800 for a Lee-Metford. In December 1912 fifteen -303 rifles were sold in Kaniguram to Alizai Mahsuds by Ghilzai traders at Rs. 2,000 (Kabuli), about Rs. 1,000 each. Popularity of various arms. On February 28th, 1913, Major Craufurd reported that Afghans preferred Lee- Metfords to Mausers, whereas Persian opinion seemed equally divided reg&amp;rdi gthe two makes, but preferred carbines to rifles. Persian tribesmen of Fars and south west Persia buy the best modern rifles available, and prefer Mausers and Mannli- chers. Arabs of Arabistan prefer Martini-Henrys, as also do the Arabs of Arabia generally. Arabs of Kuwait, however, are chiefly armed with Martini-Metfords and Mausers ; while those of the Pirate Coast are armed with Mausers and soft- nosed bullets. The American Ross rifle is not at all popular.19 ern ord )a y uds APPENDIX Ai ABMS WABEHOUSE BEGULATIONS. NOTICE BY HIS HIGHNESS SIB SAIYID FAISAL-BIN-TUBKI, AND ’OMAN.

NOTE ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE MAKRAN FIELD FORCE. April—May 1911. f By Major S. Gr. Craufurd, D.S.O. . (A) General Survey of Afghan Sphere of Operations. The Afghan sphere of operations in Makran may be roughly divided into four zones . (1) Dashtiari and Bahu, advanced base Qasrkand. (2) Dasht, advanced base Bint and Geh. (3) Task and Biaban, advanced base Maihan and Sarzeh. (4) Minab and Bandar ’Abbas. With Bampur as a base for the three eastern zones. Previous to last year s operations advanced depots behind the first barrier of coast hills were considered safe from interference. No. (1) has the disadvantage of exposure to raids from the troops located in the Baluch border. , No n offers special facilities in the way of supply and is the shortest route to the base ‘ at Bampur. In Islam Khan of Bint an able and willing ally was to be found in view of the large profits to be made. N„ has a coast line comparatively easy to blockade while feuds have broken out N 3 with some sections of the Bashakardis who, being Shiahs, have not the bond of a common religion. The Sarzeh valley can also no longer be considered a safe position for a depot. No U) onerations round Minab and Bandar ’Abbas cannot be conducted openly ; while ' Bandar ’Abbas has this year been avoided even by legitimate traders for fear of barampta. DasM therefore offers much the best facilities for smuggling of nfles under present cond.- tions. (B) Situation at the beginning of April. ... A n „ ome 1 100 Afghans were believed to be located within touch of By the beginning of Ap main parties, i.e., 700 under Muhammad Jan based on the coast; these were dm e . ^ m under Gllulam Khan moving via Bashakard Fanuch and conducting op ^ Bandar ’Abbas and Minab. No further news has been 1° th ? rn^atS pat wS may have split up, on reaching Persian administered territory, tTstl ttes vvhh the intention of buying arms locally, and reuniting up country for tne return rep „rted on the road down from up country, but these had never Another 2,000 had “ I’ Tfa h p rol)a bly sought other openings, and may have aP rrdttSrUe cCair'who hake bee? afraidio visit Bandar 'Abbas this year, included legit , th t ened from Bashakard, where Mir Barkat had obtained Complications were —topic and had as . 5Um ed an attitude of defiance to both Persian a following ^ It Ls feared that the Afghans might find their opportunity in the cStSning in this part of the country. (C) plan of operations. r i f of;™* p aeries of simultaneous landings and demonstrations along In the original plan of oper with a view to creating a feeling of insecurity the whole coast line had been m 1 . g however very sparsely inhabited, and along the actual coast line. Mu energies to the little coast ports easily accessible the Afghans had this mam ^ con _ to their base at Fanuch Dperatio^, that this period would afford sufficient time for fined to a month s duration. It for a denl onstration against Barkat in operations by the combined force as tar pm ,28 Bashakard. No resistance was thought probable in the advance on Bint, which had the follow ing objects in view :— (1) To shew the intention and ability of Government to operate in districts some days’ march from the coast should necessity arise. (2) To give Islam Khan the support for which he had asked in clearing his countrv of Afghans, and to emphasise to him the danger he was running by the encourage ment he had hitherto given to the arms traffic. (3) To force the Afghans to withdraw their advance depots behind the Band-i-Nilag range, and if possible to bring home to them, while the road to Sistan was still practicable, the unlikelihood of their being able to achieve much success in running arms this season. Barkat’s successful assumption of authority in Bashakard constituted a standing menace to British local prestige and to Mir Haji’s faction in Biaban. The latter were precluded from making terms for themselves by our refusal to accord Mir Barkat anv status as chief on the coast under the conditions then obtaining. An early settlement of the Bashakard question was desirable before the Afghans should profit by the opportunity afforded ; but it was unlikely that Mir Barkat could afford to let a demonstration in Bashakard go unchallenged. (1) Operations on Bint. The landing at Galag was commenced at 11 a.m. on April 10th and completed by midday on the 11th. The force then moved up the valley of the Rapch. Sardar Saiyid Khan joined the force at Rapr-h Telephone station. Sardar Islam Khan accompanied by the leading men of Bint arrived on the night of the 15th. On April 16th when within 33 miles of Bint 'news was received of further raiding in Biaban. With a view to accelerating operations Colonel Delamam therefore decided to push on to Bint with a small mounted column of 100 men only. This force marched again that evening, reaching Bint at 7 a.m. next day. A halt of a few hours during the heat of the day was made on the outskirts of Bint; but the town itself was not entered. The column left again at 3 p.m. and arrived back in camp at 5 a.m. on the morning of the 18th, having done some 66 miles in the 36 hours. The two Sardars’ did not accompany the force back on the return journey to the coast, advancing as a plea a summons from the Persian Governor at Bampur. Galag was reached at 6-30 a.m. on April 21st and the re-embarkation was completed by 7 p.m. (2) Operations in Bashakard. The disembarkation of the force at Sirik was commenced at 4.30 a.m. April 24th and com pleted by 2.15 p.m. On April 26th the force marched to Sarzeh. ma the (D) Brief Account of the operations. (E) Limitation to the operations. (1) Operations on Bint.visit of a few hours’ duration cannot, however, be expected to leave as lasting an impression as would have been conveyed by an advance of the whole force and a camp, even for a few days only, in the vicinity of Bint. (2) Operations in Bashakard. It is to be regretted that circumstances did not allow of the force following up the engagement at Pushak, and reaping the full fruits of victory. There is little room for doubt that Barkat s camp lay open for capture on the day following the engagement. The most difficult portion of the country had already been negotiated, and it is very improbable that any further resistance would have been made. A recapture of the loot taken in recent raids would have caused Barkat Khan irretrievable loss of prestige, and full restitution could then have been m« .d&lt;- to Mir Haji’s follow ing. Mir Barkat himself with Rais Ghulam Husain fled to a neighbouring hill top, from which escape would have proved a matter of some difficulty. Many leaders among his following appear to have been killed in the fight and, in the opinion of the countryside, the capture of his camp at Sahra-i-Gurg would have settled the Bashakard question for a decade at least. (/) Situation at 'present. The following is a summary of the situation as it appears at present. (May 1911*) (1) No Afghans can be located on the actual coast, and the majority of Jan Muhammad’s men at Fanuch appear to have returned to their homes. Small parties may have returned to Afghanistan with rifles purchased locally at prices which v ill do little more than cover journey expenses. Others may have returned empty-handed, unwilling to face the expense of another summer with little prospect of greater suc cess next year. Some small parties may be expected to remain on the chance of any successful venture as in previous years. (2) Ghulam Khan’s party is unlikely to reappear in Makran, while summer conditions preclude the arrival this season of the larger bands reported from the north. (3) Khal fa Khair Muhammad is reported to be anxious to settle in Narmashir, and to have offered his services to the Persians in their efiorts to put an end.to Baluch raids m that direction. His former settlement at Sarahingi has gone out of cultivation. (4) There are indications of renewed activity in the arms traffic on the Laristan Coast. (5) Mir Barkat has suffered considerably in reputation ; but it yet reman s to be seen if he can explain away his reverses and re-establish his damaged reputation. (6) Finally, it were rash to conclude on present premises that the recent minor operations have effected a permanent settlement of the questions bearing on the arms traffic in Makran.

On July 31st 1912 Mr. Graham, Agent of the Hr.usa line at Bombay, reported that he had investigated the origin of certain consignments of arms concealed in sugar which were shipped from Antwerp to the Persian Gulf. Apparently M. Louis Dieu, commercial repre sentative 4 Rue Trevisse, Paris, bought the sugar from Messrs. Zm z of Brussels, who them selves bought it from Messrs. Getfers Bros., Antwerp. The latter (Gevers) were instructed by Messrs. Zuaz, who in turn acted on orders from M. Dieu, to forward 10 cases out of every 25 to a certain M. Louis de Brus, 128 Rue Hors Chateau, Liege, Belgium, and to forward the balance to Messrs. Reynardt and Company, Shipping Agents, Antwerp. M. de Brus was a gunsmith, and, acting on orders from M. Dieu, he substituted rifles for the sugar, and des patched the cases, still marked “ sugar ” to Messrs. Reynardt. The rifles had been purchased from Messrs. Ludwig Loewe Spandau, who forwarded them to M. de Brus. Then M. Dieu, through Messrs. Zuaz, instructed the Shipping Agents (Reynardts) to forward the shipments to Kuwait. The first consignment of 25 was sent per S.S. Ferdinand Lauez, on behalf of Messrs. Bertie Richmond and Company ; the second per S.S. Molkefels on* behalf of Messrs. Lewis Grampton and Company. The “ Hausa ” line, suspecting nothing, accepted the shipment. On August 7th 1911 the fraud was discovered by accident on the S. S. Palamcotta., to which the cargo had been transferred, and information was given to the “ Hausa ” line. The second consignment was then searched at Bombay. The Hausa Company instituted legal proceedings; but were unable to touch Louis Dieu, in Paris, nor M. de Brus, who was not guilty of fraud under Belgian law. The other parties were innocent. The two British firms mentioned were only bogus names used as a blind. Louis Dieu in order to hush the matter up, paid all charges incurred. i Q. M. Prats, Simla.- No. S 5 G. S.
