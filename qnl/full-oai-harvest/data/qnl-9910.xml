The two main issues discussed are whether Arab rulers in the Gulf should be formally notified prior to any visits to their ports by Persian warships, and, in cases where notification has not been received, whether a call to visit should be accepted. Much of the file consists of copies of telegrams relating to this matter between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department, and the British Minister, Tehran. Other correspondents include the following: the Political Agent, Kuwait; the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for India; the Foreign Office; the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf; the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ].Other matters discussed in the file include: a reported incident of an officer of a Persian warship hauling down a British flag at Basidu [Bāsaʻīdū]; a subsequent tour of the Gulf by a flotilla of eight British destroyers, and its perceived effect on opinion in Kuwait.The file also includes a copy of an address, given by the Political Resident to the Trucial Chiefs [rulers of the Trucial states] at Dibai [Dubai], on 23 September 1933.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Visits</topic></subject><subject><topic>Warships</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
