The genealogical tables printed as appendix to this precis show the various dynastic changes that have taken place among tha Chiefs of the Pirate Coast. We shall narrate briefly the circumstances under which the changes took place. (i) JO ASM CHIEFS OF SHAR04H AND RAS-UL-RHIMA. 2. After the death of Saggar bin Sultan (killed in a foray into the neigh bourhood of Umm-ul-Kowein in 1840), his son Mahomed appears to have been sub-Chief * in charge of the Govern- st b M So t ^ a Lr E ^k\lt. Snlta,, ■ ment otShargah, while IMAm hin Sultan, one of the sons or Sultan bin Saggar, held charge of Ras-ul-Khima in a similar capacity. The head of the Joasmi tribe Sultan bin Saggar was now in his dotage and could hardly control his unruly progeny. The chiefdom was torn by rival factions led by his sons or grandsons. The most turbulent of them was Sultan bin Khalid. 3. Attempts were made in 1859 by Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan to deprive his nephew Sheikh Mahomed bin Saggar of the Government of Shargah, but Sheikh Khalid, notvyithstanding the combination of valour and treachery he displayed, was foiled in his endeavours, Hurler of Sheikh Mahomed bin Saggar by and fo[ YGn&gt; as ^ W ere, to take refuge with the Chief of Amulgavine. The feelings of animosity engendered by the above struggle do not appear to have been really extinguished, for we find Sheikh Khalid again, not only aspiring to displace his nephew, but bent also on proceeding to extremities to effect his object. Without going into the details, it may be briefly stated that a train of circumstances led to the inhabitants of Shargah being divided into two factions, at the head of one of which appeared Sheikh Mahomed, the rightful Governor, at the head of the other Sheikh Khalid, the would-be usurper. Open hostilities broke out between the factions, and after a time these subsid ing, the town of Shargah became divisionally, yet peacefully, governed by the contending parties, each party ruling over the members that pertained to his own faction. Matters continued thus until Sheikh Khalid, either weary of such a condition, resolved to rid himself of his opponent, or, as others affirmed, himself fearful that an attempt was being meditated against his life, determined to forestall Sheikh Mahomed in his purpose, and to destroy him with his own hand. Be this as it may, Sheikh Khalid invited Sheikh Mahomed to join him in a morning ride. The latter accepted the invite, and when they had reached some distance from the city gates, SheikTiT&amp;haird suddenly turned upon his companion, and shot him dead. This done, he cast his body into a well, and rode back to town. 4. Captain Felix Jones was performing a tour of the Gulf Ports in May 1861. Sheikh Khalid, shortly after the murder, expressed his desire to wait * Note —They are generally styled chiefs in the eorrespcadence, though the nominal head of the state was Sultan bin Saggar.upon the Resident on board the flagship. Captain Felix Jones, however did not feel himself capable of holding converse with one so recently and so fear fully polluted, and declined to receive his visit. , , X1 , ' Sbargah, however, continued to be governed by the usurper and murderer Sheikh Khalid. . „ _ -» rp, , . 5 Sultan bin Saggar died in 1866, at the ripe age of llo. Thereupon his son Ibrahim took charge of Kas-ul-Khima, Death Of Sultan bin Saggar, 1866, Volume another son Khalid was in charge of ill—86 Of 1867. Shargah. Ibrahim was, however, in May 1867 attacked by Khalid and expelled from Ras-ul-Khima, so that the chiefdom became reunited after shortlived separation into two. Ibrahim appealed to the Wahabi Lieutenant for intervention. . , , 7.

In the fight Khalid received a wound, which proved mortal and he died on 14th April. » , 8 Khalid was succeeded by his brother Sahm, and a nephew of their s, Samid bin Abdullah bin Sultan, was appointed Governor of Bas-ul-Khima. Hamid bin Abdullah soon afterwards threw off his allegiance to Salmi bm Sultan and proclaimed his independence (1869) . l -n- 9 In April 1869 the Wahabi Lieutenant at Beraymi came to the Pirate Coast and pretended to arbitrate some of the littoral quarrels He plotted the imprisonment of the Shargab Chief, Salim, in view to placing the Chief s brother, Sheikh Ibrahim, in Ras-ul-Khima, and bringing his nephew. Sheikh Hamid, to Shargah. _ . . . , , , , If) Sheikh Salim caught the Lieutenant m his own net, and he was shot in a general affray in April 1869. Many Proceedings, June 1869, No. 388. 0 £ Lieutenant's followers shared the same fate, and the survivors retired. Shortly afterwards, it was reported that Sheikh Salim alarmed, apparently, at the temerity of the act committed by his people in shooting the Wahabi Lieutenant, voluntarily resigned the Chiefship into the hands of his brother Ibrahim. But this recognition eventually turned out to be a mere reconciliation between the two brothers in view to strength ening' themselves against any retaliatory proceedings on the part of the Wahabi Amir ; and Sheikh Salim while himself still Chief of Shargah, was plotting the restoration of his brother Ibrahim to the Chiefship of Eas-ul-Khima, then in the hands of his brother Sheikh Hamid. 11. On the 3rd of May 1869 the Eirst Assistant Resident, Bassidore, reported that the tSheikh of Shargah had sent a force with his brother Ibrahim by sea to the Island of Zohab, and that their intention was to act thence by land and sea against Eas-ul-Khima. p.« -d * t • i . ■ The Resident received these reports when oit the Fort ot Lingah on his W iy to Maskat in the Dalhousie. So, taking the Gunboat Sugh Rose in tow, he steamed across the Gulf to the Ras-ul- Khima coast, and surprised Sheikh Salim who had already landed some 1,500 men from 32 crafts, and who then lay encamped immediately on the shore line, with his inland flank secured by a creek, in which his craft were hauled up. 13. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khima, being the party attacked, had called in the aid of the Umm-ul-Kowein Chief, who had detached five or six hundred men by sea and landed them at the town of Ras-ul-Khima. lighting had taken place both before Rasul-lChima, and at the Island of Zohab,'a little to westward, and some casualties bad been the result. 14. On the evening of the Resident's arrival (12th May), the Ras-ul-Khima Chief came on board, and explained that he had been suddenly attacked, and that the attack had for its object his own expulsion in favour of Sheikh Ibrahim. At daybreak of the 13th the Resident ran the Hugh Bose into within suitable distance of the creek, when the Chiefs, Salim and Ibrahim, came on board, having in the meantime received from the Resident a cautionary letter. The Resident recapitulated to these Chiefs the nature of the Government orders in respect to operations by sea, which should be prevented by force of arms if necessary, and gave them time until sunset to clear out and retire.3 Accordingly the Chiefs returned on shore, struck their camp, and defiled out of the creek to the number of thirty-two sail. The Resident watched them until dark, and then moved on for Maskat, to which port he had been emergently ordered by Government. 15. Regarding this affair, the Government of India expressed their &lt;c approval of the prompt and judicious measures adopted by Lieutenant-Colon el Pelly to restore the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf which had been dis turbed by the Chief of Shargah.' 1^, When Syud Azan took Beraymi in July 1869, he entered into alliance with the Abu Thabi Chief, and proceeded to threaten the remaining Chiefs of the littoral who had favoured the advance of the Wahabis towards Beraymi. These Chiefs in turn entered into a defensive compact, and Syud Azan, hearing of this compact, refrained from attack. 17. Meantime the compact of the littoral Chiefs was scarcely entered into, when one of the subscribing parties, viz.* the Chief of Shargah, turned traitor in favour of Syud. Thereupon the remaining subscribers to the compact com passed the peaceable expulsion of the Shargah Chief, and replaced him by his relative Ibrahim. IS. Some time after this Salim was reinstated at Shargah. 19. In April 1883 during the absence of Salim on the island of Abu Musa, . t , , t . xt nephew Sagar bin Khalid obtained A Political E., May 1883, Nos. 263-268. • .c oxT 'U ,1 *1 June 1883, Nos. 295-305. possession of Shargah and was recognized September 1883, Nos. 90-98. by the people as Chief. Salim took refuge July 1881, Nos. 260-261. with his relation the Sheikh of Lingah. The Resident was appealed to, but he refused to interfere and counselled amicable settlement. The Residency Agent arranged matters, and a settlement was arrived at, by which Sagar bin Khalid bound himself to allow the ex-Chiof 600 dollars a year and to pay his debts, and permitted him to retain possession of his property at Shargah and Dhaid. The Resident refused to guarantee the settlement. 20. On the death of Hamid bin Abdullah, Chief of Ras-ul-Khima, in August 1900, Saggar bin Khalid, Chief of Secret e., October 1900, Nos. 286-299.

Sheihh Said bin Tah nun, who had succeeded his uncle Kalifah bin Shakbut in 1845, quitted Abu Thabi in 1855, for fear, as he alleged, of the rising of the tribes against him on bis attempting to compel them to give up the offenders belonging to the Hawamel and Muban-hah section in the piracy against the vessel of one Abdul Karim. The facts connected with his departure appear to be that the Beni Yas tribe fell out with their Chief, Sheikh Said bin Tahnun, owing to his having put to death an elder, who was under their protection and safe keeping, and who had in 1854 slain his brother for some reason or other. Sheikh Said in accordance with the law of retaliation, demanded the life of the murderer, but the Beni Yas, fully impressed that lie had killed his brother for a lawful cause, objected and consented ordy to disburse the blood-money that was due. At length Sheikh Said gave them his word that if they brought the murderer into his presence, be would not only forgive him, but forego the exaction of blood-money. Be was accordingly brought to Sheikh Said, who struck him with his dagger and slew him, whereupon the Beni Yas rose to a man, and would have killed him, had he not entered his citadel and from very fright absconded to Gheis, taking with him everything he desired both of goods and cattle. 22. The Beni Yas, when he left, appointed as their Chief in his stead Zaid bin Khalifah to rule conjointly with Ziab, his brother. Sheikh Said bin Tahnun was killed in battle in 1856 (see chapter V («») below).4 (iii) FELASA CHIEFS OF PEBAI. 28.

Amongst other places that it visited was Debai, which port it seems to have attacked with peculiar virulence, for we find the Chief, the Chief's brother, and a nephew of the Chief, all falling victims to the disease. 24 The death of Sheikh Said bin Butye was officially announced to the Kesident by the British Agent at Shargah on the 19th December 1859, as also the nomination of Sheikh Hashar bin-Muktum in succession to the deceased. Much regret was felt at the death of Sheikh Said; for, from the day he becane Ruler of the Bu Pellasa, he had uniformly striven to repress maritime irregularities and had evinced a considerable desire to cultivate the friendship of the British Government. Sheikh Hashar bii! Muktum was nephew to the deceased. On assumption of authority over Debai he addressed a letter to the Resident expressing his anxiety to act up to his readiness to carry out require ments that might be preferred upon him. These amicable professions augured well. It remained only to be seen how far they were sincere, nor was the opportunity long presenting itself (see chapter VIII(V)). 25. Sheikh Hashar bin Muktum died in 1886 (December) and was External A, January 1887, N ob, 164-156. succeeded by his brother Eashid bin Muktum. 26.

He was succeeded by his son Rashid in the year (?), Gulf Adminisfration Report for 1890-91, Wh0 ^ed the Treaty of 1879 for the surrender or absconding debtors and died in April 1891.

ORDERS OF THE COURT OF DIRECTORS AROCT PAYMENT OF FIXES DIRECT TO THE SUFFERERS, 1853—1854. 28. In their despatch No. 121, dated 3rd December 1862, the Court of Directors observed :— 0 u The practice of paying the money received as compensation for piracies, homicides, or other injuries direct to the injured persons instead of paying it to the Chiefs is both just and expedient, and we learn with regret from paragraph 6 of Lieutenant-Colonel Hennell's letter, dated 80th January 1851, that he has signified to the Chief of Shargah that the rule would not be adhered to in cases which concerned that Chief's subjects. W e do not consider 6 the faith of Government as pledged by this unauthorized intimation and the Chief should be informed that we refuse our confirmation of it/' 29. On 13th January 1853, the Bombay Government submitted to the Court of Directors a remonstrance ad- Volume IV—109 of 18 o 3, page loi. . g u itan bin Saggar against the above orders and a recommendation from Captain Kemball, in which the Gov ernment agreed, in favour of reconsideration of the orders. 30. In reply the Honourable Court in the 7th paragraph of their letter to this Government, dated the 4th Eay 1853, remarked as follows:— ' Onr order that all monies recovered by us as compensation to injured persons shall be paid directly to the sufferers, and not to the Chiefs, has been the subject of a remonstrance from Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar; and Captain Kemball, with whom your Government express agreement, tecommends that the order be reconsidered, and that the Resident should be left, according to the circumstances of each case, ' to take such precautions in the form of exorta- tion and remonstrance, ai d by timely notice to the persons to be indemnified, as may appear to him calculated to realize the object it is directed to attain.' Captain Kemball, however, admits that money paid through the medium of the Chiefs, was by na means certain to reach the persons for whom it was intended; and as we cannot collect from his letter any other reason for reverting to the farmer practice than that its abandonment may render the Chiefs less zealous in representing the grievances of their subjects, which it is to be presumed that the subjects themselves will represent if the Chiefs fail of doing so, we must, before revoking an order evidently right in principles, request a more clear statement of the practical objections to which you deem it to be liable. ' 31. The foregoing extract had been forwarded to the Resident in the Persian Gulf for any remarks he might have to offer. His opinion was expressed in his letter, dated 26th September 1853. The opposition of Sheikh Sultan bin ISaggar to this measure was based upon his supposed rights and privileges as an independent Chieftain, as well as the obligation which attached to him of discharging the liabilities of de faulters of his own tribe, whose want of means or whose escape beyond the reach of his control rendered their personal responsibility unavailing or inexisible. Deducing thence his right to reimburse himself for losses of this nature by a certain percentage upon the compensation received when his own subjects might be the sufferers. Captain Kemball ventured to submit that their object would be sufficiently answered if, on all such occasions, his influence were exerted to secure moderation in the exaction. Under the then new system, each Chief possessing unquestionably the means to extort from his dependents any sum he pleased, it appeared to him that he could always find a pretext for rendering the rule virtually inoperative, or on the other hand if the fear of their intervention or the odium of such an act prompted his strict observance of it, the natural effect must be to deprive him of all interest in checking reprisals, or in compelling acquiescence in our views on the part of the aggrieved persons. When such persons should be dissa tisfied with our decision, or where the Muhammadan law gave aright to claim blood for blood, however accidental the homicide, the Eesident thought that the motives being wanting to the Sheikh to promote an amicable adjustment lie would not hesitate to connive at a recourse to retaliation, of which the penalty, he might argue, would not exceed the amount of compensation due6 in the first instance to his own dependents, and could not therefore subject himself to pecuniary loss. It was time that the power of the British Govern ment was adequate to enforce compliance with its behests, but the direct exercise of that power over individuals so excitable as the Arabs, when actuated by revenge, and little influenced by the control of their immediate superiors, might in some cases be productive of embarrassment. 32. Captain Kemball's letter was transmitted to the Honourable the Court of Directors, with a remark that, however right the principle laid down by them, it was probable that in practice it would not be found to work so effica ciously as that hitherto in force, of giving compensation to sufferers through their Chiefs, and that the Governor in Council accordingly renewed the sugges tion for a reconsideration of the orders. 33. The Court of Directors expressed their final decision a^ follows (Despatch No. 13, dated 27th April Volnme 111-79 of 1854. 1854) * ' Captain Kemball has assigned no sufficient reason to induce us to revoke our order, that money recovered by you as compensation for injuries sustained from piracy or maritime aggression should be paid to the injured persons themselves and not to their Chiefs. On the contrary, the aversion, expressed to the change by Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar, grounded on a right openly claimed by him to detain a part of such sums by way of compensation to himself for discharging the liabilities of offenders of his own tribe from whom he is unable to enforce payment, impresses us still more strongly than before with the importance of adhering to the new rale,'7 CHAPTER III.

' I have the honour to report, for the information of Government, that having arrived at Bassadore on the 2nd instant from Demaum, the 28th ultimo, I again set out on the 7th idem to perform the tour of the Arabian Coast; and after calling at Sharjah to receive on board the British Agent, proceeded to visit the several ports of Oman in the AmuigSn.^* order in which they are mentioned in the Ejmaun. margin. Owing, however, to the absence Debaitf 1 ' Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid from E j maun, Aboothabee. I was deprived of the pleasure of meeting that Chief; and accordingly the present which is usually made to him on these occasions will be retained by me until my return from Muscat, when, should circumstances again require my presence in that quarter, the opportunity may present itself of delivering it in person ; otherwise, having no particular business to transact at his port, I will duly forward it to him with our appropriate letter before retracing my steps to Bushire. ' 2. At my interviews with the other Maritime Chieftains who successively came on board the Clive to see me, the topics of conversation were for the most part of a general nature, having reference to the origin and progress of the war with Russia, and the recapture of Bunder Abbas by His Highness the Imaum of Muscat, in both of which subjects my visitors seemed to take a lively interest. In the cases only of Sultan bin Suggur and Saeed bin Tahnoon were grievances brought forward or matters discussed worthy of special mention. Prom one and all of them I received assurances of their continued attachment and devotion to the British Government, and of their resolution, as heretofore, to conform strictly to existing engagements. If we except two instances of irregularity intrinsically trifling, but deriving importance from their tendency if unadjusted to create further disorder, the season of the Pearl Fishery had advanced thus far towards its close without any violation of maritime tranquillity, or, so far as their own subjects were concerned, without a single collision on the banks that could be construed into a breach of the General Treaty of Peace concluded last year in supersession of the periodical truce; nor was it less a matter of satisfaction to gather from their remarks that Ahmed el Soodeyree, the Wahabee Lieutenant at Brymee, though availing himself as usual of the feuds and jealousies of the various tribes in order to preserve his general supremacy, had hitherto conducted his affairs with so much tact and discretion as to preclude any open rupture between them, and by discountenancing acts of wanton aggression upon each other, had mainly contributed to establish that state of comparative security inland which for the moment also happily prevailed. Immediately prior to my arrival on the coast he had given proofs of his intentions in this respect by bring ing to account the Monasir, a Bedouin tribe connected with Aboothabee,8 ■who in spite of his remonstrances continued to hurry their neighbour's territory and to infest the public roads. To this end- after in vain inviting the BeniYas Chief to become their sponsor, he confederated against them their feudal opponents ard by directing a well-timed foray into their own districts speedily reduced their Chiefs to make their submission, and to furnish them selves the security required for their future good behaviour. '8. 'Ihe matter on which Sheikh tSultan bin iSuggur engas-ed my attention was the desire he expressed to c )erce a tribe called Shooeyheen, numbering about 500 hghting men, who, when lately located at Sharjah, had contracted a blood-feud with the Howeleh Tribe, also residing at the same place ; and being removed by bim in consequence to Himreeah, one of his own dependencies, were now plotting with the people of that port to reject his authority and assert their own independence. The better to effect his object he foresaw that the blockade of Himreeah from the sea would become indispensable, and it was on this point he wished to consult me. In claiming the exercise of his prerogative in this instance, he said he proposed to himself only the same course that had been repeatedly pursued by His Highness the Imaum of Muscat towards his revolted subjects on the coast of Batinah, as well as one to which no objection had been offered by us some years ago in the case of the Beni Yas Chief, who, when his dependents of the Gubeysat Tribe had seceded to Adeed, was per mitted to employ force both by land and by sea to compel their return to Aboothabee, r.nd after urging upon me that if any opposition were now made thereto, he must of course be exempted from any responsibility on account of his disaffected followers hereafter, he concluded by observing that, as it was at the suggesiion of Ahmed el Soodeyree he had too hastily transferred the Shooeyheen 'iribe to Himreeah, so I might be assured, when they found them selves assailable only from the land, they would again seek his protection, who, being only too anxious to obtain a footing on the sea coast, would readily enter into their views in order to realise bis plans. ' 4. Although I was not disposed to attach less weight than might be due to the prognostications of Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur regarding the ambitious schemes of the Wahabee agents, there was still the risk of the excitement and complications usually attendant upon a maritime expedition to justify some attempt on my part to dissuade him from his purpose, and I was not sorry therefore to elicit from him a promise that the proposed measure should be postponed to every other means at his disposal and that under no circumstances would he have recourse to operations by sea until a second reference had been made to me on the subject. I observed that the precedents he had adduced of Adeed and Batinah differed so far from the case of Bimreeah that, whereas the former districts lyimr contiguous to Muscat and Aboothabee, respectively, were exempt from foreign interference, the latter port being situated between the independent States of Ejmaun and Amalgawein must afford to the Chiefs of these places both the pretext and the occasion to engage in the quarrel to the certain subversion of existing Tienties, hut, on the other hand, conceiving that his right to enforce the allegiance of the Shooeyheen Tribe so long as thev might reside within the limits of his jurisdiction could not be contested, while on their side the alternative was open to them of evading his anger by seeking an asylum with some other Chief; and arguing, moreover, for obvious reasons thG P rln ciple would be a dangerous one of admitting the pretensions of every petty Chief or clan fancying themselves aggrieved to set aside the authority of their lawfuUuperior, I persisted only so far in my disseut from his views as to propose that in a matter of such inportance the question should be re erred for the decision of Government; though I think it necessary to add jat, should he fail m his present efforts to recall the Shooeyheen to a sense ot tneir duty and again insist upon his right, 1 shall consider that I am only n icipating that decision by no longer opposing its exercise. In the meantime, Shoo^Wn^ T h , 18 .^ e( i uest ' 1 hav e directed Hadji Yacoob to intimate to the yheen Inbe and the people of Himreeah that so long as they are located must he held a, ' eiiable t0 the co; ' tro1 ^ • y ' ;0 me . a ns count upon (he operation of our ai ranee- their rebplHrf m ^ m . tenance maritime tranquillity to favour the prosacution of I trust mav r. 1S r, e ' S1L:r Jf or sci,ee tt them from the consequences. This intimation y pio uct the desired eOect, but in any case the delay I have obtainedwill at least afford me time to warn the neighbouring Chieftains against inter fering hy sea in a quarrel in which they have no concern and to make the necessary arrangements also to ensure their neutrality. '6. Ihe two cases of maritime irregularity to which I have above alluded as requiring my intervention had their source, as usual, in the flight of recusant debtors from one port to another, or in the concealment and removal of run away slaves purposing to themselves a change of masters—sources J should observe to which may generally be traced the less sedous collisions of such frequent occurrence during the Eishing Season. In the one a pearl diver who formerly resided at Sharjah, but to elude his creditors had seceded to Aboothabee, having this year engaged himself on board of a vessel belonging to the latter port, was induced while on tiie banks to visit some of his fellow-townsmen in the boat of one Khumees bin iShaheen of the Howeleh Tribe. On his proposing to return, however, that individual secured his person and refused to restore him to his present employers. In the other a boat belonging to one Abdullah bin Mntten of Dibbah, a dependency of Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur, on the Batinah Coast, having put into Aboothabee to trade, her crew succeeded in decoying five slaves from the shore with whom they made off to sea. On discovering their loss the owners of the slaves set out in pursuit in two Bug- garahs and having overtaken the Dibbah vessel near the Island of Seir Aboneid compelled her to return with them to Aboothabee, where an en bargo was immediately placed upon her by Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoon. In the former of these cases I readily obtained an order from the Joasmee Chief directing the immediate release of the pearl diver and his restoration to the parties to whom he had hired his services, coupled with a promise on his part that on the offender's return home he would subject him to a fine or other suitable punish ment ; and in the latter case, as the capture of a vessel at sea constituted a direct violation of the treaty, however justifiable the seizure or even confis cation of the one in question might have been had she been taken in the harbour, I was not less fortunate in persuading the Beni Yas Chief to remove the embargo he had placed upon her, on the ground that the detention she had experienced at Aboothabee for a period little short of six weeks, should under the circumstances be considered a sufficient punishment for the misconduct of her owner, whose proceedings moreover I had brought to the serious notice of his superior at Kus-ul-Khymah. ' 6. During my interview with Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoon, that Chief com plained to me also that two boats not indeed belonging to Aboothabee, but in which some of his dependents had shipped their property, on putting into IWeyrat for shelter, had been boarded, and a portion of their cargoes forcibly removed by the people of that place: the pretext he said was a^ claim for salvage, for which, however, in one instance at least, no ground existed, 'ihe occurrences in question having been already brought to my knowledge by the Agent at Bahrein during my visit to that island, I had duly represented them at the time to Sheikh Mahomed bin Khaleefah (to whom Poweyrat is dependent) and obtained from him an assurance that on being made acquainted with the names of the sufferers and the amount of losses sustained, he would immediately indemnify them. It only remained for me, therefore, to furnish my visitor with a letter to that Chief communicating the desired particulars, and I trust that after its receipt no time will be lost by the latter in redeeming his promise. '7.1 did not omit on this as on the last occasion of my tour of the Arabian Slaves were likewise imported last seaso,, into Coast to reproach the Joasmee Chief and Ejinaun. the Chief of Amalgawem with permitting the continued importation of slaves into their territory from the African Coast to an extent, as testified by our Agent, falling nothing^ short of that of previous years, and I pointed out to them that while the British Government was employing so much urgency to suppress this iniquitous traffic at the ports of Persia, it was hardly to be supposed that it would long tolerate similar infiac- tions of their engagements by the inh ibitants of the opposite shore with no other result than to place the monopoly of the trade in their hands and enhance its profits. To my surprise neither Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur nor Sheikh Abdullah bin Hushid attempted to deny the fact, but urged in their pergonal defence that except under the pressure of direct and obvious compul sion from a superior Power the mere exercise of their authority, I must bo10 V aware, did not suffice to put down a practice which enjoyed the sanction of Mahomedan law. They had, they said, conceded to British cmizers full powers to capture the vessels of their subjects and dependents wherever they might be detected engaging in the slave trade, and unless the Government took measures to enforce the penalties stipulated in the Treaty, or devised some other mode of punishing its infraction, it was not to be expected that they would relinquish a traffic in which for generations past they had engaged with impunity. Sheikh Sultan even went further and assured me that in conse quence of my remonstrances last year he had himself written to the Imaum and to Major Hamerton on the opening of the seasons acquainting them with the departure of his vessels for Zanzibar and authorising them either to take security from their Nakhodas against purchasing or kidnapping slaves or to adopt any other measures they might think advisable to prevent their embark ation and in proof of his assertions ^ he proposed to send me, through Hadgi Yacoob, the reply which had been given to his letter by the above -mentioned officer; The sincerity of these professions would have appeared to me less questionable had I not learnt from reliable sources that the Joasmee Chief levied four dollars a head upon each newly imported slave in consideration ot his alleged connivance with the importers.'11 CHAPTER IV.

The events of that period served to shew how little permanent success was to be expected from any attempt to reconcile the feuds and animosities of Arab tribes, in order to unite them for a common purpose, and more especially ngainst an aggressor who is skilful enough to work out his ends by iniiaming their individual jealousy and amoition, rather than by the application of force. It might be observed also that where a petty state is not sufficiently mindful of its own interest to reject the interference of the Wahabee Lieutenant in its domestic concerns, or to resist his usurpations, no efforts on our part would probably avail to prevent its submission while, on the other hand, where the spirit existed and the ability alone were wanting to maintain a protracted struggle for independence, it would always be open to Government to determine from the exigencies of the case the nature and degree of support that might seem desirable, but I venture to think that the assurance or even expectation of our aid in ail eases would not only render the minor tribes careless of provoking the enmity of their neighbours and perhaps negligent in their own defence, but must sooner or later implicate us in disputes uscribable to any other cause beside Wahabee intervention. 'I was accordingly influenced by^these views in my communications with Resident replies in the sense stated to one of Fazil tin Mahomed the Chief of the Al- the i-eni Naecm Chiefs who visit him off Him- boo Shamis branch of the Niieem tribe reeah - inhabiting a district of Brymee who like wise came off to visit me on the present occasion. This Chief stated that having materially contributed to the defence of Himreeah he had of course incurred the ill will of the Wahabee Agent who would henceforth treat him as an enemv and he asked whether the Government were again disposed to confederate the tribes of Oman against the common enemy and to afford them its assistance in expelling him from the country, I replied that however much the British Gov ernment might sympathize with any parties whose independence was assailed its present relations with the Wahabee Euler were not those of hostiiitv and 1 saw no reason for deviating from its prescriptive policy of non -interference in the internal affairs of Arabia.

' I cannot close this despatch without advertising to the effects of age now apparent in Sheik Sultan bin Suggur who seems to be rapidly sinking into a state of dotage. Not only is his sense of hearing gone, but his memory and other intellectual faculties are so far impaired as to render him the tool of designing and interested counsellors, and to stamp all his measures with vacillation and imbecility. The jealousy between his sons and other influential relatives is said to be extieme : nor will the failing energies of the old Chief suffice probably to postpone until his death a contest between them for power which must afford opportunities for the intervention of the Wahabee agent, and perhaps eventually lead to the separation of the Ports on this coast acknowledging his rule.'

Commodore Robinson in pursuance of Captain K em ball s general instructions imimated to the Chief his disapproval of such a course and required his immediate return to his own port. The grounds on which this measure wns based were explained to the Imam of Maskat in Captain Kemball's letter dated 21st Viarch 185^, viz. :— ' Your Highness is aware that the tribes of Oman have long been bound by an engagement contracted with each other under the guarantee of the British Government, to abstain in toto from hostilities at s^ea, and that prior to such engagement they had severally acknowledged the provisions of a restrictive line, beyond which their armed ves-els should be interdicted from cruizing. Now Your Highness will readily understand that if one of these parties were at liberty to disregard the above obligations, those entertaining contrary views would now, or on some other occasion, claim a like privilege, and, becoming thus enliste 1 on opposite sides, they would at once lose the character of auxiliaries to assume that of Principals. Moreover, the tribes on the Persian Coast, who are subjects of the '^hah, could no longer be restrained from engaging in the quarrel. The partizans on either &gt;ide would soon cease to discriminate between friends and foes. Piracy would ensue. Security for trade would be at an end, and in short that state of maritime disorder would speedily recur which it has cost the British Government so much trouble and anxiety to suppress. But while I thus advert to the reasons which necessarily preclude the employment by sea of the tribes of Oman in a quarrel in which they have no concern, I beg Your Highness to believe that, beyond friendly mediation for the promotion of peace, the British Government have no desire to oppose Y our H ighness' views, or to interfere with any measures that you may think it necessary to adopt for the defence of your rights or the maintenance of your interests/'' 37.

'While everything in the Persian Gulf appeared tranquil owing to the r -.n* r to ** o adjustment of local disputes and party Volume 1-106 of 1856, p.3. j? j u -j j. • T 1 feuds, the resident was, m July 18o6, surprised with the news that a descent had been made by sea upon Abu Thnbi by its ex Ruler Said-bin-Tahnun aided by the boats and subjects of the Joasmi Chief Sultan-bin-Saggar. In July 1^56 Sheikh S?id-bin-'! ahnun proceeded from Shargahto Abu Th ibi taking with him his own vessel with 25 men on board, one that of ^eif-bin-Mahomed-ul-tlurrumi, nn inhabitant of Geis, with 12 men and a third vessel of Mahomed-bin-Ali-bin Soheil Al Muhiri, an inhabitant of Abu Heil with 15 men. 39. On 19th July Sheikh Said landed at Abu 'habi. The Chief Zaid-bin- Khalifa was not there, haviug gone to a place called Zui ah and knew nothing of the arrival of his uncle. The fort of Abu Thabi was held by the Chief's brother, Ziab-bin-Khalifa. 'When the people of the town became aware of Sheikh Said's arrivcil, they took refuge in the fort and presently the fight com menced. Sheikh Said-bin-Tahnun captured the houses on the sea-shore as well as the houses adjoining in the bazaar of the Banias, which his men completely plundered.18 40. The Chief's brother held out the fort until his^ arrival witt a party of Bedo iins, who completely cut up the invader's p uty killing Sheikh Said-bin- Tahnun nnd a lar^e number of his followers; wheu the rest took to the boats and sailed away with the plunder. 41. The Bomb iy Government recorded the following resolution (Xo. 9021, dated 2nd September 1856) : — ' It appears from these papers that ex-Ruler of Abu l habi Said bin Tahnun, without the slightest provocation, made a piratical descent on Abu Thabi and plundered its bazaar, and that he acted thus, probably, w^th the connivance of the Chief of Joasmi and certainly with the assistance of some of the boats and people of that Chief. Although the plunder was carried out, the enterprise was otherwise disastrous to the invader ; for the Chief of Abu Thabi having called into his aid, some other tribes gave his opponent battle and Said-bin-Tahnun with some of his principal relations was killed. The Resident has demanded reparation from the Chief of Joasmi and has blockaded his port. The Resident has since found rea^on^ to believe that the plunder of the bazaar wa^ not wholly to be ascribed to the invader, but in some measure to the tribes called in to his aid by the Chief of Abu Thabi. Tnis may be true, but it does not, in the opinion of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, materially affect the question of the guilt of the Joasmi ( hief, if it be true that he in-tigated the attack. In the extremity of danger, the Chief of Abu Ihabi could not be expected to weigh very carefully the probability that those whom he called to his aid, might recompense themselves for their labours. It is beyond all doubt that the Chief of Abu Thabi was attacked without provocation, his own life and those of his sub jects endangered and their property plundered. Those who made or instigated the attempt must be an-werable for all the sub-equent losses. It is beyond doubt that boats of the Chief of Joasmi were engaged in this piratical attack. That Chief must make full restitution and the boats must be forfeited/' 42. Twenty-five thousand dollars was the amount of fine that was originally T o „ inflicted by the Resident upon the Volume I—160 of 1858. . . c,, ^ j i .foasmi Sheikh. After payment, how ever, of the first instalment (7,000 dollars'*, the Governor in Council having expressed his opinion that it would be good policy to evince a certain degi-e • of leniency towards the Chiefs, and the Resident hiving admitted the fine to be a severe one, iSheikh Sultan-bin-Saggar was informed that, in the event of his ctieerful compliance with fresh instalments as they reached matmity, a portion of the amercem nt would be remitted. At the close of the year 1859 the 2nd instalment fell due, and Commander Balfour was deputed to Uas-ul-Hkima to recover it. Sheikh Sultan as usual had recourse to shifts and evasion. Commnder Balfour, h )wever, was not the man to attend to idle excuses or to permit conferen -es to be spun out by atfected delays. Shei h Sultan, seeing no chance of escaping the demand, made good the whole of the 2nd instalment, barring the sum of 303 dollars for w iich he surrendered pledges. This balance had been left by Governm mt to the option of the Resident to recover or to remit as seemed to him most advisable and possibly enough, the Resident might have deemed it politic to forego its recovery, had not Joasmi dependents in the interim been guilty of fresh enormities, and thereby left no room for the display of clemency. Its payment was therefore enforced by Captain Felix Jones whilst on a circuit of the Gulf Ports in May 1860. (iii)—DISTURB 1NCES IS OMAN CAUSED BY SEYYID TURRl AND FOMENTED BY SHEIKH SULTAN BIN SAGGAR OF SHARGAH, 1857. 43. In April 1857, the British Agent at Maskat reported that Seyyid Turki p ..w i i &gt; qct v aai ^ ^ rebelled against his brother Seyyid Consultation, 31st July i 857, Nog. 461—464. . -i-i i , /•! Thowem, and had entered into a confederacy with Nasir bin-Rashid Howsini and Murhun-bin-Ali and the members of their tribe. He beguiled the Governor of Khaburah and took forcible possession of his fort. He expelled the Governor of Shinas and placed a number of the Ali-i- Ali tribe in charge of the place. The result of these proceedings was that the whole of Oman was thrown into a turmoil. There was no doubt in the mind of the Resident that Sultan-bin-Saggar was busy fomenting the disco d to gain hi-; own purposes, especially in the undefined territory towards Musmndom. The Resident took occasion to write to the British Agentinstructing him to warn the Chief of Shargah against intriguing in Maskat affairs. Tbe Bombay Government approved of this measure and requested the Resident to inform Sheikh Sultan-bin-Saggar that he would incur the severe displeasure of the Government should he persist in fomenting dissensions m Oman (letter No.! 4)^? dated 29th May 1857j. &lt;iv)—DEFEAT IX BATTLE OF JOASMI CHIEF BY THE COMBINED FORCES OF ABI THABI AND DEB A I. 1858. 44. Mahomed bin Thani, Chief of Abu Heil, having conspired with his brother to make an attack upon some Volume v 164 of 1858. members of the Mazari tribe, they proceeded with a force of 150 men, and attacked a place called Khawanij, killing in the assault three men, besides one of the Mazari Chiefs, called Faiis Ibn Ali. They further wounded two women, of whom one died. The booty they realized •consisted of 30 riding camels, two horses, and a quantity of house furniture. The marauders returned to Abu Heil the same night. 45. When Sheikh Said-bin-Butye heard of the above, he sent word to Sheikh Mahomed -bin-Saggar, Chief of Shargah, that a compact existed between them regarding their respective dependents, and that four persons, who were parties to^the compact, had been slain. Sheikh Mah ^med-bin-Saggar also addressed a letter to SheiKh Sultan-biii-Sag&lt;?ar, who on the 9th January 1858 came over to Shargah. Further correspondence passed between the Joasmi and Debai Chiefs. The former, however, consented not to restore the property that had been plundered, and the latter, finding his mediatory efforts unsuccessful, summoned the Bedouins to his assistance. Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa of Beni-Yas, too sent for the Bedouins in his neighbourhood, such as those who were present in Abu Thabi, members of the Monesin and Mazari tribes, and called upon them to repair to Shargah overland, making Debai, however, their head-quarters. 46. In March it was reported that the Joasmi Chief had been defeated by the combined forces from Abu Thabi and Debai. A reconciliation was, however, subsequently effected through the mediation of the British Agent at Shargah and the attacking forces were withdrawn. 47. The Bombay Government regarded this intelligence as satisfactory and express-d hope that the defeat which Suitan-bin-Saggar had suffered would render less difficult the duty of the Resident in restraining their Chief from sending armed vessels and men from port to port as had been recently reported (letter No. 1570, dated 2dith June 1858). 48. The following extract paragraph 13 from a Despatch from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, dated 31st December, No„ 11 of lc58, to the Bombay Government on this subject m a y be read :— 1 concur with your Grovernmeat in the hope that the defeat sustained by Sultan-bin- Saggar, Chief of Joasmi, as reported by Commander Jones, in his letter of the 2-5th March 1858, may restrain him from future piratical expeditions. As the belligerent tribes in aveng ing their comrades, who had been killed by the people of this Chief in one of their raids, confined their operations to the land, Captain Jones exercised a sound discretion in not interrer- ing with them.' &lt;t)-CONFISCATION OF BAHREIIV SHFIKII S BUGGALOW BY COLONEL PELLY : NO SUCH CONFISCATIONS TO BE MADE WIFHOUT PREVIOUS ORDERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, 1865-1866. 49. In 1861 the Chief of Bahrein having blockaded the parts of Kalif and See Bahrein Precis. disturbed the peace of the Gulf, he was Volume 96 of 1866. compelled to raise the blockade by the British Squadron and two of his warships captured, one of them was restored to him, and the other retained as a security for his good conduct. This second boat was also restored to him soon after by Colonel Felly, but again consficated20 in 186'5, as fcbe Sbeikh fraudulently withheld a larga swmof money due to some British Indians. Ihe (lovernment of India in commenting upon Colonel iMly's proceedings observed (letter ;io. 958, dated 2ith September 1866) :— ' 4. In respect of the Bahrein luggalow (whicli lias since sunk, but of the recovery of which Colonel Felly expresses hopes), I am instructed to say that His Excellency the (-rovernor- General in Council assumes, from the expressions used in paragraph 7 of the letter of 17th .December last, that Colonel Pelly did not intend to finally confiscate the vessel without a reference to His Excellency the Governor in Council, and through His Excellency to this? (Governments It shou'ld be understood that for the future no such final confiscation can be allowed to take place by order of the Resident without a reference of this nature. Serious complications in the relations of the Government of India with respect to the Powe rs bordering: on the Gulf might otherwise be the result.' (vi)— GRAVE BUIvtCII OF MAIUTI^E PEACE BY THE CHIEFS OF ABU THABI AIM) BAHRAIN AND THE SHEIKHS OF RATAR. 50. An account of this srave maritime irregularity on the part of the Chiefs of Bahrein and Abu Thabi is given in Chapter VII of the Bahrein Precis, 1854—1904. We have only to see the step&lt; taken for exacting reparation from the Katar Chiefs and thd Chief of the Abu Thabi. The following extracts from Colonel felly's report, dated 25th September, will serve the purpose : — ' Captain Brcwn audi returned with Tigilanf, Sind, and Bugft Bose to Wu&amp;ra on the Letter No. ill, dmed 25th September 1868; from Eatar Coast, where I addressed letters framed in ^ 10 0oMra - the spirit of the Governme.it instructions to the Proct-edia^g, Political A, October 1868, Nos. principal Sheikhs. The Chiefs then again came 275 — 278. on board, pleading as before their reliance on our non-interferenee, and aiding that their own attacks at sea had been purely retaliatory. I explained to them my instructions to visit them with the marked displeasure of Government, but added that, if Capta : n Brown and I could clearly see our way to a solid re-establishment of the peace, we should be prepared for this time to give a lenient iuterprotation to the Govern- rtient orders. Sheikh M ihomed-bin-Sani, the principal Chief of Katar, then gave in the subjoined declaration,* which was witnessed by Captaiu Brown and myself. ******* Sheikh Mahomed-bin Sani and the hnad Bedouin Sheikhs of Katar further gave in common aa agreement, under which any tribute due to Bahrein is to b« determined before the Resident, and hereafter to be paid through the Residency, thus providing against all dispute and e &gt;llision This document also Wis wimesseri by Captain Brown and myself. I further addressed a letter to all the Chiefs of Katar, informing them of the arrange' ments arrived at, and warning them of th^ consequences of any future breach of the maritime truce. As, however, it appeared that certain of: our British Indian subjects residing at Bahrein had been: plundered at Wukra to the a nount of 18,0 'U krans, it seem d j ; ust that the Chiefs should reimburse this !&lt;um. I demmded it accoriingly, an i it was paid, six thousand krans in cash a'ld twelve thousand krans by bill on a wealthy pearl merenani at Lingah, the bill being secured by a bag of paarls made over to sealed for deliv ry to the pearl merchant on p ayment of the bill. On the evening of the 12th the Bind took both Vigilant and Hugh Rose in tow (as the saving of coal Was an object), and we then proceeded to Abu Thabi. rriving at that port on the morning of the 14th Captain Brown and [ pulled on shore and delivered to the Chief's son * letter drawn up in conformity with the instructions of Government. But this Chief, whose tribe is powerful, an I whose strategic position between the iVlaskat and Wagra territories has heretofore given him gre it weight, seemed quite unable to realize that Government were at length resolved to check his irregularities. He sent an Agent with an evasive letter on board, iind Captain Brown then moved the ships close in shore. Again the Chief sent an evasive letter on board, and it became necessary to as-ure him that, if further delay ensued, compliance with the Government demands Would be enforced. At the same time, it apneared to me undesirable at the present moment to resort to force if our object could any way be otherwise attained ; and this because our merchants at Abu 1 habi have many lakhs of rupees invested in the pearl season now closing, and which would probably be lo-t to them were the Abu fhabi fort to be destroyed and the pearl divers to 1 desert it in favour of some other port. On the following morning, therefore 1 requested Haji Ahmed, the Maskat Minister, to favour me by calling on the Chief, thus convincin him that the Government were in earnest. * P. 138 of AitstUisoBV Treatiegf Vol-21 I added that, if by 10 o'clock the Chief did not bring on board a written compliance with our demands, the ship's guns would open on his fort. At half after nine the Chief came on board and handed me the subjoined declaration * which was witnessed by Captain and myself * * * * * * * * * * The Chief further sent on board to me the two Arab mares which he had received from the Bahrein Sheikh as portion of the Katar plunder. These mares are now at Bassadore m charge of the First Assistant Resident. Their owner, the Sheikh of Waba, has been invited to send a duly authorized Agent to receive charge of them. I warned the owner however, that if for the future he or any other Chief should take the law into his own hand instead ot referring to the Resident, and should thus lose his mares, I would indeed, compel the plunderer to give them up, but that, instead of restoring them, I would cause them to De publicly shot. As regards the guns (three in number) of the Abu Thabi Sheikh, it seemed proper that e should surrender them, but at the same time there was risk if he were deprived ot them, mat his fort might be insulted by the bedouins, and that injury would result to the trade ot tne port. I arranged, therefore, in concert with Captain Brown, that the guns shou e surren dered and then returned to the Chief on deposit pending good conduct, thus ta 'ing a guaran ee for the future. * See Aitchison's Treaties (1892), Vol. X, p. 137. e23 CHAPTER VI. PIRACIES xm OTHER MARITIME IRREGULARITIES IN 1854-1855. (i) PIRATICAL ATROCITIES OF HAMID BIN MUDJII) UL AMAIRI, 1851-1855. 51. In the year 1851 after peace had been concluded between Amir Faisal and Sheikh Mahomed bin Kalifah, Chief of Bahrein, Hamed bin Mudjid ul Amairi, who appeared then to have been a partizan of the latter, captured two boats belonging to Kalifah, plundered their cargoes, and carrying the crews to Volume 11 —78 of 1854. Genneh, murdered four of their members Consultations, 19th January 1855, No. 20. in cold blood and sold or ransomed the remainder. Some time afterwards hearing of a Koweit vessel in distress near Museylimah he put out in seven boats from Genneh, attacked her and appropriated everything on board and then availing himself of the recent disorders at Bahrein, without any previous declaration of war and under the pretext of supporting the cause of Mahomed bin Abdullah, he captured boats belonging to that island engaged in trade. 52. Inasmuch as Sheikh Mahomed bin Abdullah repudiated any intention to molest vessels at sea in his passage to Bahrein, it was clear that he was unable to control such lawless partizans as Hamid bin Mudjid The Resident felt himself under the necessity, therefore, of addressing (letter dated 26th August 1854) in the first instance Amir Faisal, stating the facts and adding;— ' In tlie event of his continuing to reside under yonr protection I feel assured that Your Highness will not only require Mm to make reparation to the parties he has injured, but further iofiict upon him the punishment he so fully deserves; otherwise I trust that you will expel him from your territories in order that the requisite measures may be taken against him. Your Highness mnst be sensible that the British Govftrnment will never tolerate or overlook piiatical proceedings of this nature nor will spare any trouble by every means in its power to ob'ain satisfaction.'' 53. The Court of Directors insisted that energetic measures should be taken to bring to book this notorious pirate. There were two alternative courses open for this purpose, one to attack him in his den at Aunich or in its vicinity, and the other to blockade the whole coast from Demaun to Has Tanurah. The first course was attended with considerable risk, as only the boats of the squadron could approach the shore. The second course would be an arduous and tedious duty requiring at least three vessels of war or even more. The first course was adopted and Commodore Eobinson was despatched with the squadron to effect the purpose. 54. The operations undertaken for inflicting the long-delayed punishment on Hamid bin Mudjid for his piratical atrocities appear to have been directed with judgment by Commodore Robinson and carried into eft'ect with spirit and energy by Commander Howett. Hamid and his followers were attacked in their position on the Katif coast, and after a sharp contest and some loss of life on his side, he was compelled to surrender his buglah which was burnt on the spot. 55. The Court of Directors observed on these proceedings (Despatch No. 8, Volume III—108 of 1866. dated 20th 1856) ' Though we cannot regard this as a sufficient penalty for the enormities he had been guilty of, in putting some of his jirisoners to d.eath and selling others for slaves, we are willing to hope with the local officers that a sufficient lesson has been given to him and to any who might be disposed to follow his example/ 7 5o. The Chief of Bahrein, of whom Hamid was an acknowledged dependant, was made to pay the amount realized by sale of the captives on the island of Bahrein and the plundered property. The captives were ultimately bought24 bv their own friends and set at liberty. The Court of Directors approved of these proceedings (Despatch No. 8 ot 1850, dated 20th February). (if) MUTUil ACGRESSIOSiS OM THEIK BOATS BY THE PEOPLE OF SHARGAH AND SB4YSMAH • OlIESTIOS OF EXPEDIENCY OF PERIIITTIJiC RELAXATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HOLDING CHIEFS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF THEIR DEPENDANTS, 1853-1854. 57. Mahomed bin Fullah, a native of Mumzur, in the outskirts of Shargah, having put into Doah on the Katar Coast Foreign Department Cons., 20th January £ or wa t erj two slaves absconded from his 1853-1854, Nos. 18-22. ^ oo( j ^ e | r esca p e to the neighbouring town of Smaysmah. Having traced them thither he demanded their surrender, but the Chief man of the place, either unable, as he alleged, or unwilling to recover them from a party of Bedouins into whose hands they had fallen, declined compliance, Mahomed bin Eullah then left Smaysmah, and presently falling in with a boat belonging to that port, boarded her, and not only took out two slaves to replace those he had lost, but also a quantity of property; and wounded two of her crew. Captain Kemball was engaged in investigating these occurrences, when the people of Smaysmah, without awaiting his intervention to redress their grievances, took the law into their own hands for this purpose, and having intercepted a boat belonging to Rasul-Khyma bound for Bahrein, captured her with everything on board; but happily without inflicting any injury upon her crew. 58. The Political Resident decided that both parties should make restitution for the value of the property plundered from each other and that Mahomed bin lullah, being the aggressor, should furnish security to the amount of 250 dollars for his good behaviour until after the termination of the Pearl Season, The Commodore of the Persian Gulf squadron. Captain Robinson, found no difficulty in recovering the amount of damages (200 dollars) and that of the security from the Mahomed bin Fullah through the authorities at Shargah, but the amounts the Smaysmah tribe were liable to pay, was recovered with consi derable difficulty. The Sheikh of Bahrein showed much reluctance to compel the tribe to pay the money, and wished the British authorities themselves to recover it from them. He urged that any attempt at compulsion by himself would result in the tribe renouncing allegiance to him and ranging themselves under the sovereignty of bis enemy the Beni Saud. 59. A question was raised on account of the objections urged by the Chief of Bahrein to be held responsible for the acts of the Smaysmah people, viz; whether it was expedient to permit any relaxation of the principle of holding the Chiefs on the Gulf responsible under all circumstances for the acts of their dependants. 60. The Government of India, concurring with the Government of Bombay, stated in their letter No. 206, dated 16th January 1854 :— ' He considers it desirable that Captain Kemball should be allowed to exercise his own discretion in cases in which the enforcement of the responsibility by a Chief would lead the tribes to renounce their allegiance to him, and he is accordingly pleased to direct that Captain Kemball be authorized to relax the operation of the Treaty in the manner proposed, whenever he may see occasion to do so.' (Hi) PIRACY AGAINST ABDUL RARIIfI S VESSEL, 1855. 61. In January 1855, a shoee belonging to one Abdul Karim of Bahrein Consn. 9, N 0T .mb.r 1856, No 8 .24-27. while .^turning from the coast of Oman to that island, encountered a storm from the north and went in for shelter abreast of Odeid. Whilst there two buggalows both belonging to the people of Abu Thabi bore down upon the ship and plundered her, wounding Abdul Karim and killing one of the crew in the fight. 62. The Resilent decided that prompt reparation should be demanded for this atrocious crime, and despatched Commander Ethersey with instructions to demand from the Chief of Abu Thabi {i) the value of the plundered property estimated at 740 M. S. Rs. as well as (ii) Deeah or compensation for blood25 ,,,, . i .,1 , l('i '!!. '&lt; 1 ' i' :l ' ; (!, ' J - 1 ai! '' ' ^ due to the relatives of the murdered man, which was fixed at 600 dollars, and (Hi) the surrender of the two boats engaged in the piracy. 63. The chief of Abu Thabi, Sheikh Said bin Tahnun, had at this time fled from Abu Thabi and Sheikh Zaid bin Kalifah had taken his place. The latter, when Commodore Ethersey made the demands upon him, which had been originally addressed to Said bin Tahnun, contended that he should not be held responsible for the acts committed by the tribes prior to his succession. The Commodore answered that no change in the Chiefship could cancel the respon sibilities of a Chief. for the liabilities of his predecessor. Sheikh Zaid bin Kalifah ultimately complied with the demands. The two boats engaged in the piracy were burnt. • t , , .1 v.;. i -- - - — — ' ~ 1 ^ (iv) PIRACY OF THE RALLIAN AT SHARGAH, 1855. 64. On the llth November 1855 a nouree, the ' Kallian/ the property of Eesident 's letter dated loth December 1855, one Kimji Gopal, a .British subject, who Vol. No. HI of 1856, p, 19. resided at Bombay, reached Shargah from Mangalore, laden with 2,550 muras of rice, and 35 guni bags of coffee, consigned to people of that port. i 65. On the 15th 1,000 of the muras w^ere landed, and next day 1,170 more together with 36 guni bags of coffee. 66 On the 18th, whilst lying at anchor in the outer roads, a storm arose, which eventually drifted her ashore, and at sunset, when the wind had abated, the tide fallino- and the swell subsiding, she was left with stern high and dry on the beach No sooner had she stranded than the Nakhoda perceived crowds of Arabs coming down to plunder her, so he hoisted his coleurs, and said : « This is the British Plag, do not come near, my vessel has suffered no injury. The Arabs however, insisted on boarding her, plundered her of everything., gear, nronertv, sails, and all, tore down the Flag and destroyed it, and beat the crews and stripped them of their clothes. This done, they collected m a body and shoved the nouree straight under water, and having procured the necessary implements they cut up her cabin. The nouree people possessing secured in a box a second i^ lag, the First Officer said to the Arabs, ' This colour belongs to the Sirkar, do not molest it.' Whereupon the Arabs commenced abusing the Sirkar most violently, and severely beating the spokesman. 67 The offence was regarded by the Resident as of a very serious nature ; for not only had the Arabs plundered the crew and insulted the Elag of the Sirkar but in a case where they should have assisted the people of the nouree who were ii difficulties, and should have aided them in floating their vessel, and recovering the property that was in her, they, on the contrary, purposely sunk her and robbed her of all that was on board of her. The Resident there fore deputed a British man-of-war to Shargah to investigate and settle the affair with a demand on the Chief to recover, in accordance with list enclosed, from his subiects whatever they took from the nouree, either the property or its value aggregating N. M. Rs. 4,720 to repair all damages done to the vessel and to punish the perpetrators of the act, that others might take warning. 68. The Chief tried to excuse the act as a legitimate one, as the vessel was wrecked ; he also contended that the culprits were Bedouins, not natives of Sharo-ah There was no doubt, however, that a large number of Shargah Arabs took part in the crime. As to the other plea. Captain Eelix Jones was of opinion that to admit it would encourage depredations on the whole coast of Arabia. The demands of the Resident were substantially complied with by the Chief of Shargah. (v) PIRACY BY AX ABU TIIABI BOATS; CONDUCT OF THE CHIEF IS PROMPTLY PUNISHING THE OFFENDER, 1855. 0Q September 1855 the buggarah of Juma bu Buttain, native of Abu Thabi, having on board 12 pearl divers. Resident's letter dated 19th November 1855, ge ^ ^ p ear l 'banks. Eight of the Vol. 1—83 of isoo. divers absconded off shaya, and embarked in other boats belonging to that port; Juma bu Buttaiu's buggarah proceeded26 to I)ebai, to which port Juma bu Buttain himself repaired, and finding his boat was delayed, he took her to Abu Thabi, got substitutes for the absconders, and despatched her to the pearl banks, on arrival, she fell in wi(h the bug- garah of Hamid bin Par, in which were 4 of her runaway divers and accordingly she bore down upon the buggarah, and, after wounding two of the crew, seized upon the fourth. 70. When Juma bu Buttain's boat returned to Abu Thabi, Zaid bin Ealifa laid hold of the offender, confined him in the citadel, and sent the divers to the British Agent at Shargah. 71. In accordance with the Resident's recommendation, the Bombay Government authorized him to communicate to the Chief of Abu Thabi their satisfaction with his conduct on the above occasion and to make a slight increase in the value of the next annual present with an intimation of the reason for the same (letter No. 5116, dated 31st December 1855). 4433 F D27 CHAPTER ¥11. PIRACIES A \I&gt; OTHER MARITIME S R R E(* I LA U I TIES. 1850—61. (i) AN ATROCIOUS PIRACY AlVf) MURDER BY THE FEL4SA TRIBE AM) A NATIVE OF KHUSSAB, 1859-60. l 2 \ Little \ efoYe the death of Sheikh Said of Debai in 1859 an atrocious act ot piracy and murder was committed by parties of the Bu Eelasa tribe, and r ® dress was demanded from the Debai Chief. The case was in many respects an extraordinary one. Seldom had a murder of so cold-blooded a character been perpetrated in these seas. Pew and rare were the instances that had occurred of criminals being overtaken by the hand of justice and brought to punishment under circumstances so favourable to non-discovery and escape. mally, as expressed by Captain Pelix Jones, never before had a murderer been unconditionally surrendered by Arabs of the Persian Gulf into the hands of the Political Eesident. Briefly the circumstances attendant on the enoimitv, as also the steps that were adopted to obtain redress, were as follows; 73. Abdullah bin Hussein ul Baili, and cousins ^bdul Rahman and Sulev- man, all inhabitants of Hasa, and all subjects of the Wahabi Amir, left Hasa on business. Besides divers articles of wearing apparel, provisions, and so forth, they carried with them eighteen hundred dollars in hard cash, and took ship for 0]eir at which place they arrived in safety. From Ojeir they proceeded to Jirza touching at Bahrein on the way. At Jirza they went on shore, and stayed some three days m the house of one Hussain Abdullah. On the third dav thev tell in with a person called Obiyd, Nakhoda of a boat belonging to Debai, who agreed to take them across to Lingah for the sum of three krans. They invited Ubiyd to take refreshments with them, and after sunset prayers embarked with their coin and their baggage in his boat, safely bound as they imagined to the port ot _ their destination on the opposite coast. Abdullah bin Hussain and his companions had not been long on board ere they retired to rest, the boat having y this time reached some distance off the shore. Sleep overtook them, and they remained m ignorance of the fate that was hanging over them until they were aroused by the boatmen fastening rope round their necks, evidently bent upon then- destruction. ^ And notwithstanding their appeal to have their lives spared, and their promise in God's name to inform none of God's people ' if permittee, to reach the shore, a deaf ear was turned to their entreaties, and thev were pitilessly hurled into the sea. The boat spread her sails and sailed away Unly one of the crews managed to keep float until two native vessels belong ing to Sur picked him up, and carried him to Maskat where he laid a com plaint before the British ^gent. Prom Maskat he came to Bushire. and placed his case m the hands of the Political Eesident. P C ?; ptain • F ® lix Jones at 0Ilce P r oceded to adopt measures for the obtain- ment ot full reparation. The first step he took was to depute Lieutenant Pendall, Commajiiding Her Majesty s Corvette Falkland, on the errand of tracing out, it possible, the perpetrators of the outrage, and this officer having succeeded in ascertaining that the criminals, and a vessel which they had purchased out of the proceeds of their crime, had gone to Debai, Commander Balfour repaired with 6 ? i e -fT 0 i SS ^ S ^ ie s ^ adron ca ^ u Pon, and, if necessary, to compel the Cmet of Debai to fulfil the demands preferred upon him by the Resident The demands were five in number— The surrender of the vessel to the British Officer who had full authority to burn it publicly off Debai. 2nd. Payment of a sum of 1,800 dollars, being the amount of cash sworn to as in possession of the murdered men and in the plunder of which indeed emanated their destruction,28 3rd. —Dlieeah or blood-money for the wilful murder of Abdul Rahman-bin- Osman, and Suleyman ibu Abdul Abdul Aziz on the high seas, six hundred dollars for eacb=l,200 dollars. 4th. —Penalty or fine for the attempted murder in the same way of the survivor and informant, Abdullah-bin-Hu^ain-ul-Baili. 5tli. —Amercement for the piratical act itself 1,000 dollars, which sum Resident consented to forego when the chief murderer, the Nakhoda Obiyd, should have been publicly executed for his offence on the high seas. Punishment of the murderers was left to the Chief, the surviving individual and relations of the murdered men having consented to forego blood for blood, and having accepted its price in accordance with the Muhammadan law. 75. Later in the year it became known to the Eesident, whilst on a circuit of the Gulf, that Mahomed bin Buzzan, one of the perpetrators of the murders, had taken refuge at Khussah, his native place. The Resident determined, therefore, if practicable, to cause his surrender. He called upon the Chief and Elder either to make over the murderer, or to pay the fine of a 1,000 dollars, and by way of impressing upon them the necessity of immediate compliance with one or other of the demands, he requested Captain Balfour to make a demonstration with the men-of-war under his command The Chiefs and Elders deemed it prudent to comply with the Resident's requisition, and surrendered the culprit unconditionally into his hands. Captain Pelix Jones conveyed him to Maskat, and delivered him over to His Highness, Syid Toweyni, whose subject he was, to be dealt with in accordance with His Highness's views and ideas of justice, and His Highness having unhesitatingly declared that by death alone could so heinous a crime be expiated, sentence of death was pronounced upon him accordingly. The sentence, was publicly carried into effect on the 21st of May 1860, Mahomed-bin-Buzzan being blown from one of the Imam's guns on the shore. 76. The Government of Bombay, after acknowledging Captain Pelix Jones* communication reporting that the whole of his demands upon the Sheikh of Debai for piracy and murder by some of his dependents had been complied with, informed the Besident that the proceedings reported in his letter were fully approved by Government, and that Commander Balfour appeared to have acted with great judgment and firmness. 77. The Secretary of State in a despatch, dated 17th November 1860, observed:— a The vig'Or and promptitude with which the Political Resident, Captain Jones, acted on the occurrence of th^ piracy and murder peipetrated by t-ubjects of the Chief of Debai, and the energy with which the heavy fine of 4,600 dollars imposed by the Resident was recovered by Commander Balfour, were highly creditable to both these officers, and their conduct in this matter has attracted the favourable notice of Her Majesty's Government.' 78. We may note the manner in which the 4,600 dollars recovered from the Chief of Debai were disposed of. Of the above sum as reported by the Kesi- dent in a despatch to the Hombay Government, No. 56 of 22nd Pebruary 1860—' eighteen hundred dollars plundered from the victims were refunded to their immediate relatives, and the survivor, Abdullah-bin-Hussain-ul-Baili, to whom also, in accordance with custom, the blood-money recovered— 1,200 dollars—was also paid. The balance, being penalties or amercements inflicted for the offence, the Resident transferred to the credit of Government as a set off to contingent expenses ' in the Gulf in conformity to instructions conveved in the Secretary to Government's letter under date 4th December 1858/ (ii) MARITIME OFFENCES COMMITTED BY THE SHEIKH OF HIMRIAH, 1860. 79. Salim bin Ayaf, a subject of Sheikh Abdul Rahman bin Sief, the Chief of Himriah, was guilty of plundering some females who had taken passage in his bont from the port of Shaam to that of Shargah Sheikh Abdul Rahman happened to visit Shargah, and our Agent Haji Yacub took occasion to demand from him payment of the sum of 46 dollars due for the outrage. Por some time29 the Chief not only refused to disburse the amount, but aggravated matters by holding improper language to Haji Yacub. Eventually, however, the 46 dollars Were paid, and distributed according to the Political Resident's orders among the sufferers. 80. Not many months bad elapsed, when the Chief of Himriah committed a fresh maritime offence. The Sheikh of Shargah, who was engaged in a land attack upon Bu Heile and Khan, solicited his assistance. Sheikh Abdul Kahman, regardless of consequences, was rash enough to proceed by sea to the scene of hostilities with troops and mnnitions of war. The Political IVsident sentenced him to a fine of 250 dollars, which sum he duly disbursed to the British Agent at Shargah, after a demand had been preferred upon him for payment by Commander Cruttenden (Resident's letters dated 25th .February 1860, No. 61). (iii) maritime offentes committed by the sheikh and people of BOKHA, 1860. 81. The Sheikh of Bokha, one of the Shihiyin ports, w r ho for some time before had been occasioning trouble was at length guilty of two offences destructive of maritime order. 82. A native of Shaam repaired to Bokha, and professed his desire to enter into terms of friendly alliance with Sheikh Suleyman bin Malik, the Chief of the place. The latter assented, requiring, however, as proof the sincerity of the former, that he should perpetrate some act of annoyance against the people of Shaam. 83. The native of Shaam accordingly departed in the night, and stole away a Buggarah and some fishing nets, returning with them to Bokha. Sheikh Hussan bin Mahomed, Chief of Shaam, preferred a complaint, which resulted in an infliction of a 100 dollars fine upon the Bokha Chief by the Political Resident, and the deputation of Commander Balfour to enforce its payment. 84. The second offence was still more heinous in its character. It was a case of inhospitable and barbarous treatment of a shipwrecked crew. An inhabitant of Sharga, w T hile abreast of Khor Khoweyr, to which place he was bound in his buggarah manned by three men and a slave, met with adverse w 7 inds that pre cluded him from entering Khoweyr harbour. He thereupon directed his course upon Khassab but, while off the 'port of Bokha, the sea running high, his boat foundered. All hards reached the land. In lieu, however, of receiving kind treatment, they were seized by the Governor who robbed them of thtir slave and 20 kronees, which was all they had saved from the money in the buggarah. 85. Prom this outrage a further penalty of 100 dollars was inflicted, making a total of 200 dollars to be taken from Sheikh Suleyman bin Malik, the Chief of Bokha. 86. Commander Balfour reached Bokha on the loth February 1860 in Her Majesty's Steam Prigate Semiramis. The Elphinstone was also in attendance. Prior to Commander Balfour arrived. Lieutenant Uyer, commanding Her Majes ty's Brigantine Tigris, had already demanded the 100 dollars for the first offence, but had met with a refusal from the Chief. The appearance, however, of one of Her Majesty's Steam Frigates accompanied by the Sloop of War Hnhinstone seems to have produced a salutary influence upon Sheikh Suleyman, for he waited on Commander Balfour, paid over 100 dollars, a moiety of the total due, and give a written bond pledging himself to disburse the remainder aiter a lapse of two months. Commander Balfour, after admonishing him to be more careful how he ever again refused any demand made on him by the Captain of one of Her Majesty's Indian Navy vessels, admitted his excuses, and accepted his offers. 87. It may be observed that the bond was duly dischargtd by the Pokha Chief on the occasion of the Resident's tour of the Gulf during the month of May 1860.30 (iv) PIRACY OF THE FUT1I UL-KHAIR, I860. S8. Tn the month of January 1860 the a vessel belonging- t© Abdull'ih bin Tussuf, an inhabitant of the Persian Port of Lingah, proceeded t -wards Shargah She encountered a storm, and made for shelter to Kas-nl- Khima. This port she contrived to reach in safety, and anchored outside the bar. The violence of the elements, however, increasing, she sailed for the hirer harbour, and whilst endeavouring to effect an entry unfortunately ran aground. Presently, some 15 or 20 boats, containing armed men, and com manded by Sheikh Ibrahim, son of Sultan bin Saggar and Governor of Kas-ul-Khima, surrounded her and attempted to bo »rd her. The crew of the Futh-ul-Khair for a time prevented them from effecting their object, but Sheikh Ibrahim was not to be deterred from carrying out his purpose, and the Futh'ul-Khair being incapable of resisting so large a force, was eventually boarded and plundered of her cargo. The doings of Sheikh Ibrahim and his followers did not rest here. JNot content with the amount of barbarity and inhospitality they had already inflicted, they caused the defenceless vessel to be damaged, and in this condition they left her to the mercy of the elements. She contrived to return to Lingah, notwithstanding the dilficulties she had to contend with, and Commander Balfour happening to be in the neighbourhood at the time of her arrival, her owner, Abbullah bin Yusuf, laid a complaint before him. 89. Commander Balfour deputed Lieutenant Dyer, Commanding Her Majesty's Brigantine Tigris, to investigate the complaint, and to demand repara tion should the accusation prove well-founded, and having presently ascertained that not only had the Sheikh of Eas-ul-Khima been guilty of the outrage, but that he refused to afford redress, he repaired to Ras-ul-Khima in person with three vessels of war to compel Sheikh Ibrahim to pay the full value of the property plundered, such payment to be distinct from any fine the Resident might subsequently see fit to award for so gross and barbarous a case of piracy. The first step taken by Commander Balfour was to call upon the chief offender's father, Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar, as hsad of the Joasmi tribe, to make repara tion for the injury inflicted. Finding, however, fr'im Sheikh Sultan's written rejoinder that he denied all knowledge of the outrage, and directed his son Sheiuh Ibrahim to alTord redress. Commander Balfour thought it advisable, more especially as only a few days previous a heavy sum h id been exacted from Sheikh Sultan for a separate offence to prefer his demands direct upon the Ra^-ul-Khima Chief. This course he accordingly adopted, and called upon Sheikh Ibrahim to disburse 810 dollars as an equivalent for the property pirated. Sheikh Ibrahim professed his willingness, but from poverty his inhability, to meet the demand, whereupon Commander Balfour entered the Ras-ul- Khima creek with the boats of the squadron, 11 in number, 8 carrying guns, seized six vessels, and took them in tow. 90. Sheikh Ibrahim, when he saw measures of severity like these were being resorted to, promised Commander Balfour whom he had previously met on the beach, to pay the coin in a few hours' time, and left for the town to obtain it. Commander Halfour placed the seizures in charge of an officer inside 'the bar,' and returned with the boat force to the vessels of the squadron. To save unnecessary details suffice it to say that in the course of 48 hours, thanks to the energy displayed by Commander Balfour, the whole sum (dollars 810) was duly paid, and a fine of 500 dollars extra having been inflicted upon the Kas-ul-Khima Chief as penalty for the piratical offence, this amount was also recovered by Commander Cruttenden during cruize he made in H. M.'s sloop of war Falkland. It must be noted that the fine was ordered by the Bombay Government to be inflicted in addition to the amount of compensation to mark this special abhor rence of the conduct of the Jasmi wreckers. The Government decided in short that restit ution of plunder or its equivalent in value was not sufficient to deter th' Amhs from the commission of fresh offences nnd authorized the levy of an extra sum as amercement (G. R., dated the 3rd May 1860). (v) DETENTION 01 A BOAT OF KIIASSUi BY THE CHIEF OF AMULGAVINE, 1861. 91. In ]\Iay 1861, the Resident received a complaint from the Sheikh of iinassab that a Buteel belonging to his people had been freighted by the31 people of Ejman for the prosecution of the Pearl Fishery at Socotra, but that, after a detention of 12 months, nothing: had been paid to the owner of the boat by the charterers. The Resident investigated the circumstances connected with accusation, and ascertained that the Chief of Amulgavine had seized the chartered boat on account of a claim he possessed on the people of Shargah, leaving him nothing wherewith to pay the freight money. Matters standing thus, the Eesldent directed that the Amulgavine Chief should disburse the freight amounting to 93 dollars. Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid duly disbursed the amount, which was made over to the British Agent at Shargah for payment to the owners of the boat (Resident's letter A, dated 16th May 1861). (vi) RAIDOG ON RATIF COAST BY ABU-THABI PEOPLE, 1861. 92. The Governor of Katif complained that some people from Abu Thabi whilst fishing in the neighbourhood of Katif, landed and carried off 65 sheep belonging to his subjects. Sheikh Zaid, where the matter was placed before him, acknowledged the offence of his dependents, and cheerfully disbursed 120 dollars, the value set upon the sheep. This sum was made over to the British Agent at Bahrein for distribution among the sufferers, and the authorities of Katif expressed their gratitude for British intervention (Resident's letter dated the 16th May 1861). 93. Haji Yacub reported that early in the year 1861 an attempt was made by certain delegates of His Highness the Imam of Maskat to induce the Beniyas Chief to aid those who were striving to undermine the Joasmi Chiefs power. Sheikh Zaid, however, steadfastly and honourably refused to listen to such proposals, and although liberal promises w ere made to him, he declined to take part in the intestine quarrels of the Joasmi tribe. The Amulgavine Chief was similarly tempted, and like Sheikh Zaid did not permit himself to be corrupted by offers of gold.. ■ * ■33 CHAPTER VIII.

I am directed to forward to you, for submission to the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a letter, and of its enclosures, from the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, No. 43, dated the 28rd ultimo, and to state that the views of this Government on the important subject discussed in these paper will be shortly submitted to His Excellency the Governor General in Council.

A lthough loath to trouble Government with petty details, I would ven ture to append a few specimens of the complaints that reach their representa tive from the littoral of the Persian Gulf; and these should not be considered as selected specimens, for I have taken them one by one as they have to-day turned up, and the records show thousands of such cases. ' 2. Pormerly the Resident would have despatched a vessel of the Gulf Squadron, with an Assistant or Agent on board, to enquire into the cases, and with instructions, failing satisfactory arbitrament, to blockade, fine, or other wise punish. But under the more recent expression of views by the Indian Government, I do not feel at liberty to use any coercive measures, or to levy any fine, unless under the explicit instructions of Government. 3. It so chances that at the present moment a vessel of war is arrived at Bushire. But, although I am sure the Commodore desires to co-operate to the best of his power, the Commander considered himself bound to suggest, within 12 hours of landing, his proceeding to the East Coast of Africa, where his duties • tti .v.Ttrvi.. n , ca tt l 1 * 11 ! ^ protect the liberty of the •He leaves the Wahhabee Envoys here and their Af - Gainst the A rabs - and th^ business uilullisbeu.

Were it Dracticable. and havm ' ere it practicable, and having regard only to Arab feuds and invasions would most gladly recommend our withdrawal from the Persian Gulf line • but the force of circumstances impels us to take an increasing interest in this line. It is the shortest way from India to Europe, and may some dav become our principal overland route. We are already dependent on it for our teleffranh communication with England, and, notwithstanding the follies and tyrannies of surrounding Native Governments, the Gulf trade continues to increase Apart trom its coasting trade, horse dealing, and an annual outturn of nearlv half a million sterling in pearls, it is estimated that the sea-borne trade may , £ „ , £ now be upwards of five millions sterling 0 CaTcati r0m y ' Madra8 &amp;nd 3,000.000 0f ^ the ^ buJk finds ^ To and from Batavia, Singapore and Way to OUr possessions, and is in large part Mauritius . . 1 ,500 ,000 in the hands of our subjects and vroteah To and from Kurrachee and Red Sea .

All lawful trade would, of course, fall away, and as to convey ing part or it, our mail steamers and square-rigged vessels would cease to ply. 8.

I beg to inform you that a boat belonging to me was broken up at sea bet een Bahrein and Kateef, and seven men who were on board of her were murdered. They blame Peysul for this act, as the sail of the boat was found in his possession. Feysul has denied the charge, and has accused Abdoollah Omanee of the deed. A bdoollah Omanee, who was with Feysul, hearing of this accusation, sought protection with the Chiefs of Bahrein. The Chiefs of Bahrein now demand blood-money for the murdered men. This act was committed on the high seas, and obtainment of reparation for the same rests with you. I claim blood-money for the seven men and the value of the boat and gear, worth 55 dollars. It was my duty to inform you of this occurrence, as obtainment of reparation for the deed rests with you, and there is no excuse to be made in the matter. The boat is owned by me, Khumees bin Esau Seyhatee. Translated purport of a letter from K haled bin S ultan , Chief of Sharg-ah,—dated the 2nd Ramzan 1282 (20th January 1866).

Her cargo was taken out by the boats of the place, and only a portion restored. The owners of the85 stranded bugla then wished to float her, but were hindered from doing so until the waves broke her up, when again the owners tried to save portions of the wreck, but were again prevented. This is the order at sea now-a-days. If the Sirkar consent to our acting in like manner, let us know; but if the Sirkar intends doing justice to us, we require all that was taken from the bugla, as also all loss that has happened to the bugla since she struck.

TIIF snnilVIV TRIBE: 0PERATI01VS OF SIIAUGAH CHIEF U , VI\!S1 THEM: THEIR POSITION, 1855-59. Murder of Mnsliari bin Ibrahim bin Sultan, Governor of Dibbab, by the Sliihiyin Tribe. Measures taken by Sultan bin Saggar against tbein. Resident's prohibition of maritime operations against their tribe. Resident's cruise from Ras nl-KMma to Rasmnsseudom, 1855-57. T 95 j' r om the report of Haji Yaoub, British Agent of Slwgah of Jammry r 1Q( . 1856, it appears that m 18o5 Mushari, Vol. IV—163 of 1857, pp. 183,187, 197. ^ Sheikh Ibrahim, was deputed to Dihhah as Governor of the place. The new Governor commenced persecuting the Shihiyin tribe residing there. All their cries for redress to both Sheikh Sultan and Sheikh Ibrahim were unavailing. They therefore la'd in wait for Mushari when the bitter was proceeding from Dibbah to Uas-ul-Ivhima, and killed him. The property that was with him was also seized. When Sheikh Sultan became apprised of the occurrence, he issued ordens to the people of Shargah Khan Bu Heyle, Fusht and Hira to collect their fighting men, launch their boats and sail to Havul-Khima, thence to march overland and commence operations against Dibbah. . „ 96. When the fleet reach-d ti as-ul -Khima, Ibrahim bm Sultan embarked with tlie Zoab tribe and proceeded with 100 boats to Dibbah by sea. A number of the Shibiyiu tribe, who reside in Kumzar, embarked in their boats with their Chief, Mahomed ibn Ali Hussaiu, and took up a position off E^uWibbah. whence they pursued the boats pertaining to Sheikh Sul tan bin Saggar. They gave chase to two Has-ul-Khima boats, but did not come up with them. 97. A Butil, owned by natives of Kutnzar, put into Khore lakan to pur chase a'cow, the people being ignorant of the matters that had occurred. The Khore Pakanis killed 8 of her crew, imprisoned 7 others Mid hauled up the Tliil il on tbe beach. Mahomed ibn Ali Hussain, head of Kumzar, preferred a complaint to tbe British Agent. When Captain Jones heard of these move, mentsf he wrote to the Sultan bin Saggar remonstrating against the Chirfs- nroceedings prohibiting transport of troops and mumttotis of Ihe, translation of correspondence in the matter is printed below, showing' as it, does the relation of the tribe to the Chief and the grounds on which Captain Jones proceeded It may be noted that the Bombay Government approved of his proceedings (letter No. 2068, dated 12th May 1867)- Dated 9th January 1857. From—Commander Felix Jones , I. N., Resident, Persian Gulf, To—Sheikh Sultan bin Sagga.b , Chief of Ras-ul-Khima. ******* I have heard what occurred when you were preparing to proceed and chastise the people of miZyour subjects, for murdering your grandson. I have also heard that you have despatched a fleet of boats to take part in the operations. Now this has given rise to fear and disorder. Be it known unto you, therefore, that I wiU never permit troops and war-like stores to h. transnorted by sea, for it will merely occasion dreadful confusion, and entail loss on neu- tials ? warn you to des.st If the people of Dibbah, Kumzar, or others, have been guilty of irregularities, proceed by knd to coeree them. ^ ^ , The affair of Abu Thabi is still pending. Remember ships of war will shortly be deputed to your quarter to give confidence to the Sirkar's well-wishers, and to inflict punishment on the disorderly.38 Bated 26th March 1857. From— Sheikh S ultan bin S aggak , Joasmi Chief, To—Captain J ones , Political Resident, Persian Gulf, You wrote me that you were afraid of the disturbances that might arise from my proceeding by sea to Dibba. I before informed you, and again now inform you, that when an attack was made on my grandson, Mushan, and I wished to proceed against the parties who attacked him 1 deputed my sons for the purpose. They, however, found the roads had been stopped by the bhihiym tnb^ and accordingly returned to Ras-^-Khima, whence they embarked and sailed to Dibbah. They fell m with boats on the way, but did not molest them in the slightest. Inquire, and you will find I speak true. My people refrained from acts of oppression on the sea out of consideration for you. The Shihiyin were guilty of many maritime irregularities. They embarked from Kumzar, and other places, and proceeded by sea. I hope you will not be so over- particular with me in affairs of this nature, for the Shihiyin are my people and my dependents. When the Admiral was in the Gulf, the Shihiyin tribe attacked a number of the peopl 'e o aab (my subjects), and the Admiral told me to remain passive until he had reached Maskat, and consulted the Imam. His Highness, when consulted by the Admiral, said : ' Whoever is Chief of Dibba has also authority over Ras-ul-Jibbal.' The Admiral accordingly sent me per mission to act as 1 liked with my people. I submitted the particulars to Colonel Hennell, who told me If such be the case show the Admiral's letter to Mulla Hussain, British Agent at bhargah. _ I did so. Mulla Hussain wrote to the Resident, who said: 'Very fjood vou have permission./ I proceeded against the Shihiyin accordingly by sea, and avenged myself on them. Inquire of Haji Ahmed ; he is aware of this occurrence. I hope you will not give the preference to my subjects over me (who am their Chief) thereby causing ruin to my people and my territory. Dated 23rd April 1857. From—Captain J ones , Resident, Persian Gulf, To—Sheikh S ultan bin S aggar , Joasmi Chief. Your letter of 26th March in answer to mine of 9th January has just reached my hands I regret to hear of the losses you are likely to sustain, and of the death of your grandson at the' hands of your refractory subjects, the^Shihiyin. Would it not, however, be better to ask your- self if oppression had not driven them to violence ? I have however no desire to interfere on this subject, but in respect to moving your fighting men and armed boats by sea I will hear nothing ; for on every occasion when this has been done maritime aggression has followed and the peaceful in the end have become a prey. 1 repeat, again, I will no longer suffer this, what- ever latitude may have been allowed you formerly. On this poini my determination is unalter- able, made, as it has been, upon the constant aggressions of your people, an example of which is still recent m the conduct of the Abu Hayle, and the connivance of the authorities of Sharo-ah 1 allude to the piratical attack on Abu Thabi during last summer. This you and they have shortly to answer for to the Sirkar, and I warn you once more against adding to the list of offences at the present time. That you may fully understand me I say again I will hold you accountable for any armed movement your boats may be employed' in by sea whether against your own subjects or others, for there is no discrimination when bent on such errands. Ine land is open to you for all purposes. Be content, and receive warning in time. 98. The Chief then complained in a letter, dated 15th March 1858, addressed to the Government of Bombay, against the measures of the Resident and enquired whether he would not be justified in repelling the atlaok bv sea of the people of other tribes. ^ 99. Relative to the subject of the above complaint the H esident observed Vol. vil—166 of 1858, p. 153. that Sheikh 8ultan bin Sfiggar's accusation , , , , _ , against a part of the Shihiyin tribe as foundation 00 ^ destro y ed his towi1 of ^bbah was wholly without The motive for Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar's addressing the Governor in Council direct was evident to the Resident. It was to enlist the Government sympathy so that his own design, by sea against the Shihiyin tribe might have its support, desirous as he was of forcibly subjecting those feeble people to his rule, and thereby dtvertmg their allegiance from their proper Chief, His Highness the Imam of Maskat, to himself. J* * . Shihiyiu had ever been enemies of the Joasmi, thouch in the wpaTcpn^d periods of the Imam's rule they had been brought under the yoke of that tribe, whose piratical tendencies had been conspicuous at all times. Of late39 years the Shihivin had been more than ever desirons of returning nnder the authority of the Imam, and had been struggling to effect their separation from the Joasmi. In their conflicts by land much blood had been shed to this end, and boat collisions had threatened the tranquility of the sea. With the first the Resident had never interfered. (Kesident's letter No. 250, dated 23rd April 1858). 100. As throwing much light on the affairs from Gape Mussendom to Vol. 111—105 of 1860, p. 173.

Extract from a Tour Report for 1859, submitted ly tie Political Resident in the Tenian Gulf with his letter dated 27th May 1859) No, 196, Shihiyin Forts. Owino- to seizures made by the tribes of this family as brought to the Resident's notice by Sheikh Sultan bin Saggar, he determined on inspecting the localities between Bus ul Kbima and Cape Mussendom, with the object of warning the Chiefs ot the bad consequences of inter rupting the free navigation of vessels employed m peaceful pursuits m the vicinity of their Jibndes The Resident was, moreover, anxious to exhibit to these people that the nooks and bidinp-■olaces which afforded concealment and shelter to the slaves and the pirates were not sealed' to British cruisers, while desirous of impressing on the Government ofccers themselves that a little enterprise would render them familiar with localities which had hitheito been studiously avoided or approached with dread by our vessels. To a steamship there could be no risk whatever, and to a well found and smart sailing cruiser (above water as most of the dangers are), the chances of accident are, in the Resident's opinion, very remote indeed. Arrivino' at Bakha at noon on the 2nd May, the Resident had the satisfaction of effecting the release of the four prisoners, not however without some difficulty, as they had been seized in retaliation for injuries done to their people by the Joasmi on former occasions. It was, however explained that, had their capture been effected on shore, on no account would the Resident have interfered, but as it was otherwise, and they were iW fide membeis peaceably disposed crews of trading boats, he insisted on their hberation They were then LlTvered up and sent with the Native Agent to Sultan bm Saggar An intimation m writing was also made to both parties that, should either again transgress by making ^!ar captures was aisoma £ , • ht d d on the Resident demanding not only the release S Setptivet bat 1^ »£ a huudred dollars for every individual so taken. To the Sheikhs of Khassab and Kumzar, the most influential of the Shihiym, a similar adveitise ment was made on visiting their ports. j j i it. While occupied on these duties the intermediate bays and inlets were threaded by the steam frigate 'Zenobia/' with caution but with the utmost ease. Every estuary and cove was minutely examined, and comnQumcation held with the singular class of people. The ShL^ia who have found a habitat in the few sandy spots which present themse ves amid the chaos of rock, of hill and of precipice which abruptly rise from the depths of the bulf, and which conceal commodious and unvisited harbours capable of affording both water and shelter to those who may be in need of them and where, indeed, the pirate the slaves or the distiessed mariner mio-ht readily find a retreat, whether from the enemy or the storm Besides Bokha, Khassab and Kumzar, which may be denominated the principal villages of these people, they Assess Suber and Shem in El,tinstone's Inlet, Ghool Ah m Colville s Cove, and other mtermediate between Ras Mussendom and Khore Pakawn on the Batmah Coast where a steam vessel had never before been seen Great, therefore, was their surprise at finding the Se as it were at their very thresholds, wholly shot out from her element the sea and traversing their inland waters like a swan that had been familiar w.th them from infancy. &lt; ome alarm was at first evinced, but intercourse gradually dispelled its traces. The Resident m a short time learnt that they had a predilection for the Government of the Imam of Maskat, but were imXcable a-ainst the Joasmi of Oman. Otherwise, they seem a poor and harmless people content with the produce of their nets, a few dates and the veriest rap for clothing. Their shin cries of rubble, basalt or lava refuse from the precipices above them are on the lowest scale and hidden, as they are, in the most secluded nooks of the rocks, must be quite uTbetable in the heats of a Gulf summer. Yet they seem happy in their comparative freedom their only dread being the coming of the rapacious Joasmi from the s.a. On ftfCldent assuring them .hat they need anticipate no - -tafaon so long -they A .el™ refrained from outrage on the waters, they seemed to be ovei joyed iney taiKea or tne Portuo-iiese vestiges yet existing in the neighbourhood, and wi.en speaking amongst them- selveslndulged in a f ' patois J ' quite foreign to every one, even the Persians and Joasn.i, on board though readily understanding Arabic and conversing with strangers m that language. It was at first thought that they might be offshoots of the Portuguese stock while hat nation helHs sway aHhe neighbouring island of Hormuzd, or Oormuz, but careful analysis ..roved the dialect to be of Persian origin, sadly corrupted and with inflections uhollj different £iom thLofthat language. On the whole, .rrespective o£ the grandeur o£ desolation wh.ch the40 ^itire peninsula forming the north east promontory o£ Arabia exhibits, the squatting of this isolated and miserable people amid its columns of basalt and lava afford a picture well worthy or attention. Proies?ing Mahommedanism of the Sunni type thev know nothing whatever- of its doctrines or of books, and indeed only exist in the most primitive manner. Yet they are proud enough to deny their daughters in -marriage to any but their own tribe, though, as they naively observed, they had no objection to accept those of other families if they fell in their way I heir mo-ques, or places of worship, have more than ordinary care bestowed on their construction and, stuccoed as they are, are the most prominent features when approaching their homesteads from the sea.41 CHAPTER X. ♦TELEGRAPH AND TRIBES AT MIJSSENDOM: JURISDICTION AND SOVEREIGNTY OVER THIS TERRITORY, 1864, 101.

Secretary to Government, Bombay,— (No. 44, dated off Stewart Island, the 29tli February 1864.) 'On the23rd and S4fch instant I addressed yon two letters, Nos. 35 and 39, and conveying, for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Conncil, particulars of how affairs then stood at our telegraphic station in the Mussendom T erritory. ' In continuation of the above letters, I do myself the honour to submit the following additional intelligence : / « On the 24th instant Colonel Stewart and myself left Muscat; on the 26th idem we arrived back here, and Colonel Goldsmid, who with exceeding kindness had consented to remain behind for the purpose of vatchmg over our newly-established relations »ith the Arabs, hastened to rejoin us and to make known to us that, although nothing could be said m pmse of Sooley- man, ttie Hubbalayn Chief, personally, but rather the reverse, still the teims we were on with the Arabs generally were not on the whole less satisfactory than when Colonel Stewart and myself had quitted Mukheb for Muscat a few days antecedent. One or two matters had, however, occurred v,h.ch demanded delicate handling, and which I proceed to relate in detail. The first event refers to the unfriendly demeanour and behaTiour of Sooley- man, the Hubbalayn Chief, and it is thus Colonel Goldsmid has described it: t* Sunday, Sooleyman and Abid came to our camp with a few followers. It was reported to us when sitting in the tent that the two had set upon one of our builders and beaten him. Mr. Philliparoslie K sic in original) stated that, had he not rescued him, he would have suffered severely; as it was, he was much cut and ' hurt with hard blows from sticks. Wet t Mr. Walton and I, Mr. Huz, &amp;c., &amp;c. i ns tantly rushed out and the result was a Ion 0 * remonstrance and discussion. Sooleyman argued that, if we took the part of these people, we n%ht lose all our stores, and he would not be responsible The men stole and deposited the effects in his village. I gave him to understand « For general account of telegraphs iu the Persian Gulf, see the Precis on Commerce and Communications in the Persian Gulf. ^ 84. F.D.42 that this sort of outrage could not be tolerated, and that, if he had anything to object, he must say it to the Baliooz, who would soon be here. After long and unsatisfactory talk, the two withdrew with their men. I endeavoured to preserve cool temper throughout, and impress upon these men that such an act as they had committed was in our eyes a serious breach of propriety. A man from Kumza, armed with a matchlock slung across his back, whose face wais not unknown to me, interfered during the whole affair in a manner which had every appearance of friendliness to us and our position. After this little scene we had quiet for the day. Read service in the said shed to a party of about 15. ' Gun-boat returned about 9^ p.m. ' Moodoy, Abid came in the morning. I had already instructed the moonshee to say that I was displeased at the behaviour of these Chiefs yesterday; so much so, that I had rather not talk to them in our camp, or that they come here at all. if they wished to see me, I w r ould go and meet them on board Victoria, which could draw near the shore if necessary. He went away annoyed, as 1 was told, and said something about writing to Khussab and Kumza. ' Tuesday, 23rd. —Abid appeared again in the morning, bringing a sick old man for treatment. I went up close to him without recognizing him, as he had left oft his turban and wore a so all cap. Pinding who it was and the mission on which he had come, 1 thought it better to relax so far as to say a • Using ,h. word «tab..' ob.di.„t. f''' 0 F. ds ! ' ul ] to ^ ''e 'M man to Mr. Campbell. A bid made some remark •and touched his head, evidently intending that he was submissive ; whether sincere or not, I cannot say : the moonshee was of opinion ' that he is thoroughly sorry at what has occurred.' ' This concludes the description of the first event. I proceed now to relate the second event, and think it best to subjoin Colonel Goldsnrid's version of this also ; Colonel Goldsmid has described it as follows :— ' Wednesday, 24Ui. —A strip of paper was brought to-day, of which the following seems a tolerably correct version:— From Hamid bik Mahombd and Aleb bin Rashid and all the Bedouins, to His tlie Syed Baliooz. ^ceiienoj ' Greeting. 4 We inform you that the Bedouins came to you and received jfaii»onfe.-—Thii letter, though menacing in iti nothing, and it is not our pleasure that tone, is likely enough a begging letter more than you should alight here; We are 7 000 .njthinc.i.e, (gd.) hf. and ilie people of tlie sea have nothing to do with these hills. ' 'And Sooleyman and Abid and Hamid cannot keep the Bedouins from yon, nor^can the people of Khussab do so ; give us something, or your abode is net safe. ' The messenger who brought it lias been told by the moonshee that he could not read it; but I thought it better to say plainly if he wanted an answer, he had better await the arrival of the Baliooz, to wliom it was addressed and who waa daily expected. He said he was going to Mukhukoo, and would' return in the morning (Sd ) F. J. Goldsmid, On Special Duty. ' On the 27th instant the Bedouins' messenger returned for a rejoinder to the letter he had delivered on the 24th. After consultation with Colonel Goldsmid, I gave the messenger a verbal reply to the effect that, if the Bedouin Chiefs who had deputed him were desirous of conferring with me on any iubject, I should be happy to receive a visit from them on board Ber Maiestv's Vessel Coromandel. J 7 ' The messenger thereupon departed, and up to the present instant nothing farther has been heard either of him or of the Chiefs'who sent him I pass now to the consideration of our position at Muklub as viewed in a general light, and on this subject I am happy to have it in my power to state that so far as present appearances warrant my pronouncing an opinion, matters are looking up and our prospects are brightening.43 ' In recording the above opinion, however, I beg it may distinctly bs understood that I by no means intend to imply that the necessity for dispatch- insr a roval navy vessel to these parts has been altered or removed. Ihe necessitv I consider, still continues, for, in the first place, appearances, as is wpll known are oftentimes deceitful, and, in the second place, there are not wantin' indications to keep up in my mind the impression that the presence here of'a vessel of war wonld be invaluable as a check upon the evxl pro- ties of the Arabs. It shoMd be remembered too, I respectfully submit, that this is the first occasion, the very commencement I may say, of British 'itereourse with the wild Arabs residing m these regions. Colonel hte«art will I tru , within ten davs, be leaving this place for Bushire and Eu-sorah, and I purpose rem-iinino- a short lime after bis departure with a view to watch how matters ''^d to strive and conciliate the Arabs ; I shall further endeavour cautiously 10 collect reliable information respecting the tribes around, who they are subject to, and so forth. . , . » I cannot think of closing this despatch without recording the valuable assistance I have derived from Colonel F. J. Goldsmid on all occasions and on all matters of importance since my arrival here from Muscat. The value of the advice 1 have received from him has been enhanced by the cordiality with which it has been accorded No. 35, dated the 22nd February 1864.

H avklock , Esq., Officiating Secretary to Government of Bombay. &lt;4 On the 27th ultimo, I made known to Her Majesty's Government that I bnd hist returned from the Mussendom Districts, to which I had proceeded on duty connected with the sub-marine telegraph; on the same date I forwarde transcript of a roughly-written and hastily-prepared letter I had addressed to Colonel Patrick Itewart on the subject of my visit There were points however I observed in one of my letters, that required particular notice, but whleh, o\ving to the want of time, I wa. unable to do more tban cursorily touch upon 1 proceed accordingly to rectify the omission, ^nddo myselftbe honor to submit the following observations for the information of His Exc lency the Governor in Council. j j ' 2. Muklub, the spot discovered last year by Lieutenant Stiffe, and nxe upon within the last few days by Colonel Stewart for our short telegrap land line, lies between the villages of Hubhalayn ard Muk h ' 1 ' 101 ^ ^ 0 r l ^ h g Inlet. The Mussendom Districts, including Khussab, are held to be ^dertfie sole authoritv of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. My surprise, therefore, was not inconsiderable on the 1 , th ultimo, when I beard remarks which created in mv mind doubts as to the correctness of the opinion hitberto entertained n recorded regarding the boundary of Bis Highness s possessions m Mussondum I was seated on the above date conversing with Sooleyman, the Sheik Hubbalayn, and 1 learnt from him that the Hubbalaynites pretend to acknow- tedge Sheik Sultan bin Baggur, the Joasmee Chief, as tlu^ lord and not His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. To the above observation on the part of Sooleyman, the Chief. I merely stated, in reply, that I wasaoquaiDtedwitbt Joasmee Chief, and that he is on terms of fnemlsmp with the British boye n ment At the same time I inwardly felt that, if it be really true that Hubba layn is subject to the Joasmees, and not to Muscat, discussions might poatib y Safter aril with reference to our cable; and this anxiety ^ ^Ued me to notify the circumstance! to Government m my • though time was not at my disposal to enter into detads ] Mukhukoo, the second village specified, is distant from Hubbalayn some in o mUes bv sea and three miles by land, is a place of occasional resort for the inhabitants of Hnbbalayn, and is. in fact, under the authority of the Chief of Hubbalayn: Muklub, situated as it is between, and m villages named, is, therefore, in like manner, subject to the( hief of ttulilKilayn. Altboush from the manner in which Sooleyman made known to me that onnriS himself a subject of Sheik Sultan. I thought there be some truth in the statement he advanced. I felt by no means disposed to cr ^ lt t ^ e story until 1 had cautiously instituted enquiries on the subject. Without,45 war to protect and ensure respect to our officers and establishment temporarily employed among these uncivilized barbarians. Were it possible for a Eoyal Navy Vessel to be stationed off Muklub for a time, say two or three months, I feel assured that the effect would be invaluable, and that the objects above indicated would be thus fully attained without the risk of complications. So far as I can judge, there would be no necessity, on the contrary, it would be rather unadvisable, for her crew to go much on shore or to mix themselves with the natives. Her presence would act as a salutary check upon the Arabs if inclined to be annoying or mischievous, and her protection would be available to us if actually necessary. ' 5. I conclude by observing that many of the suggestions contained in this letter are made after consultation with Colonel Patrick Stewart, who, no doubt, will also furnish a .Report. ** 6. A copy of this despatch will be forwarded in due course to Colonel Pelly, Acting Political Resident at Bushire, and as I purpose returning imme diately to Mussendom, it is my intention presently to submit further particu lars to Her Majesty's Government Dated the 20th Pebruary 1864. y rom — L ieutenant -C olonel H erbert D isbrowe , Political Agent, Muscat, To—His H ighness S yed S oweynee , Sultan of Muscat. 44 'With reference to my letter under date the 6th instant, I do myself the honour to make known to Your Highness that i have returned from Malcolm's Inlet. ' 2, The following particulars may be of interest to Your Highness:— ' 3. The submarine cable has, thank God, been successfully laid as far as Muklub, the narrowest point of the isthmus between the village of Hubba- layn and Mukhukoo, and telegraphic communication thence with India has already commenced. ' 4. With regard to the site for the station, so far as I am at present able to judge, Khussab, and not Muklub, will be selected by Colonel Patrick Stewart for the permanent buildings. Muklub will be utilized merely for the construc tion of a short land line, and no officers will be stationed there, the position being painfully arid and in other respects unsuitable. It will, however, be necessary thoroughly to provide for the protection of the land line and the extremities of the submarine cable landed on either side of Muklub, and as it is desirable, with a view to this object, to enter into certain arrangements with the inhabitants of the spot, I shall feel obliged by Your Highness informing me, for the purposes of official record, whether Muklub, together with the other two villages above named, form part of Your Highness s domi nions, and further, whether we possess Your Highness s permission to carry out the arrangements above referred to. ' 5. Colonel Patrick Stewart and Sir Charles Bright accompanied me from Malcolm's Inlet to this port, and are anxious to do themselves the honour of paying their respects to Your Highness.

H avelock , Esq., Officiating Secretary to the Government of Bombay. It has struck me that in my letter No. 35, dated yesterday, I have perhaps, scarcely expressed myself with sufficient clearness and force regarding the temperament of the Hubbaiaynites and Mukhukooites; I do myself the honour, therefore, to submit the following additional observations :— ' 2. I lived, as already made known, among the Hubbaiaynites for a number of days anteoeaent to the arrival of the telegraphic vessels with the cable, and 1 had then, and have had since, good opportunities of observing their incli nations and characters. I might enter into a lengthy description of little incidents and occurrences that have taken place, bu«&gt; time does not admit of my furnishing details. '3. I shall confine myself, therefore, to recording the impressions that have been created in my mind by my visits, and these are, that the Eubbalaynite and Mukhukooites are destitute of the good qualities that generally characterize the Arabs : the only qualities 1 have, indeed, been able to discover among them are lying, cunning, avarice, thieving, and mischief. 4. Hospitality and civility appear unknown among them, and their Chief Sooleyman, seems to be the greatest villain of all. In short, although it is but fair that I should record the fact of myself, my servants, my horse, and my property haying been in the midst of them unguarded and yet unmolested for a number of days recently, still I am aware that thefts have since been committed on property belonging to the telegraph, and I feel assured that nothing but fear restrains them from being openly mischievous, I might almost say violent. &lt;e 5. I venture, therefore, strongly to reiterate the opinion I expressed in my letter above adverted to, that the presence of a man-of-war is imperatively necessary to ensure protection and respect to our ofiicers and establishment temporarily employed at Muklub '. No. 6 60, dated the 8th March 1864. From C. G onne , Esq., Officiating Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To— L teutenant- C olonel H. F. D isbeowe , Political Agent, Muscat. 'I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters, dated the 22nd and 24jth ultimo, Nos. 35 and 39, submitting observations in connection with your recent visit to Mussendom, and suggesting that a vessel of war be dis patched tor the protection of the telegraph party employed at Muklub. t a' commun,ca ^ D S ^he approval of Government of your proceedings, i am desired to state that orders have been issued for the dispatch of the Gun boat Hugh Rose to Mussendom, and His Excellency the Governor in Council trusts that the presence of this vessel will afford adequate protection to the e egrapn party and stores in that neighbourhood, and assist in maintaining e au onty of His Highness the Imaum of Muscat so far as it legitimately_A, 47 c&lt; 3. On this latter point I am to observe that it does not appear that tHe Joasmee Chief has preferred any claim to sovereignty over Eubbalayn. The Imaum will doubtless assert his rights if questioned by the Sheik of Hubba- layn, but meanwhile you should request His Highness to take measures to ensure all his subjects in the vicinity doing whatever Colonel Stewart may require of them for the protection of the wire. 44 4. With a view, however, to secure the cheerful co-operation of these people in carrying out His Highness's intentions, you should, after consulting the Imaum on the subject, inform Colonel Stewart what arrangement you would recommend for the attainment of this important object, whether it be the payment of regular allowance or otherwise. 5. In conclusion, I am desired to state that, pending the arrival of the Hugh Eose the Hon'ble the Governor in Council is inclined to think that His Highness the Imaum could provide, by means of his men and vessels sent to Khussab, for the safety of the persons and property belonging to the telegraph at that place'. 102. Colonel Pelly in his letter dated 24th March 1864, asked the Bombay Government for instructions as to whe- Vo. 7 o 1864. ther the Telegraph Station at Mussendom should be considered as belonging to the political jurisdiction of Her Majesty's Consul at Muscat or to that of the Resident in the Gulf. 103. There was recorded the following Resolution by the Bombay Govern ment (No. 1156 C.—59, dated 21st April 1864). ' It is generally admitted that M usssendom is in the territory of the Imaum of Muscat and the political jurisdiction over the Telegraph Station at that place properly belongs to the Political Agent at Muscat; who at present actually exercises supervision over the place.'

Notes on Mussendom. ***** 4th March 1864, ***** Our course from Muklub landing was about south-south-east till we reached the rocks on the east side of the Malcolm's Inlet, when we gradually worked round to the north-north-east and entered the wide and sheltered Bay of Fillam, sighting the village on the low sandy ground at foot of the hill. To the westward and almost opposite Eillara Bay, and the other side of the Malcolm's Inlet, is the village of Mancul, the second or alternative settlement of the Pillamites. Such is Shem to Kana, and such Habellein to Mukkaka. The boatmen were civil, but had no sooner rounded the point and lost sight of the Isthmus than they declared themselves to be subjects of Sultan hin-Saggur and quite independent of the Imaum, Whether the time for such assertion were chosen with a purpose or not, I cannot f Except a Smdi Servant. sa y } ^ ^[ usca t Moonshee, who t Was my sole personal attendant, assured me he had never heard it from them before. They said that Mukkaka Rana, Shabus and other places were, in this respect, in the same condition as themselves * * * * u 5th March 1864. —The old builder whom I had recognized at Fillam yesterday came to-day to the Coromandel He says that when we first arrived, Suliman, Sheikh of Mukkaka, wrote to report the circumstance to Sultan bin- Saggur, who answered ' La taka lifu hum^^do not oppose them, it is of no mattery let them stay where they please and have what they want'. * * * * ♦ This report was forwaided to the Government of India with Bombay No. 19, dated 3rd Ncvember 1864.48 ' 10th March 1864.—On the western coast of Mussendom promontory are Kumzar, Ghumam, Ghubba Ghussa. The first is at r the northern end and the two next are subordinate to it. Ghussa is under Khussab, and all these through the Sheikhs of Kumzar and Khussab acknowledge the sovereignty of the Imaum of Muscat. On the eastern coast, I learn from one of the PiUamites on board to-day, that there are Shisa, 100 inhabitants, Shabus, 50 inhabitants, Fiilam, 200 inhabitants, all of which achnowUdge the authority of Sultan bin Saggnr during the period of the yearly date season, because they then migrate to his territory at Dibba, where t heir dates are situated. Out of that season, they profess no more than a nominal allegiance to that Chief and consider themselves tolerably independent of any Sovereign's control.' 105. The Political Agent at Maskat in his letter No. 94, dated the 3rd May 1S64, submitted for approval a copy of Vol. v -71, of 1864, p. 88. ^he Regulations issued by him on the Telegraph Islands in the Elphinstone Inlet, and reported the establishment of a police force for the preservation of peace and property on those islands, the community of which has increased considerably owing to the importation of artificers and workmen from Kurraohee. 106. The Bombay Government recorded the following Resolution No. 1987, dated the 5th July 18d4 :— tir V\\Q Telegraph Islands in the Elphinstone Inlet are part of the Muscat territory. Lieutenant-Colonel Disbrowe should therefore be informed that he should be guided by his Consular instructions in dealin? with offences committed by British subjects. If no measures have been adopted by the Sultan of Muscat for the punishment of his own or other subjects not being British, the Political Agent should apply to His Highness for the requisite authorityrand deal with them according to his judgment and discretion.' 307. In his letter No. 17, dated 28th Vol. iv -84, of 1864, p. 120. March 1864, Colonel Pelly reported :— ' Colonel Stewart informs me there is some incertitude as to whether the position selected for the Telegraph Station, in the Elpinstone Inlet, belongs to the Sultan of Muscat, or to the Chief of Ras-ul-Khima. In our hitherto relations with the littoral Arabs, for the maintenance of the maritime Truce we have never de6ned the boundaries of their several jurisdictions; but have made responsibility depend on personality : tlie recognized Chief of every tribe or settlement engaging to afford full redress for aggression on the part of his dependents. I fear that if in the present instance we analyze the question of territorial right, we may find it lead to bad blood among the tribes. Reliable evidence on either side may be wanting. And we may in the last result fail to come to any certain decision, or the decision may involve us in inconvenient recognition of boundary, without decreasing risk of molestation. These remarks would, I think in some degree, apply to an endeavour on our part to purchase the position from Ras-ul-Khima, whether in our own name, or in that of the Sultan of Muscat. Unless Government have already determined on any other course of action, it is possible that without raising any general question of boundaries and their recognition, I mi^ht obtain from the Chief of Ras -ul-Kldma a document, engaging him to prevent, or give full redress for, any interference with our Telegraphic operations, on the part of his dependents. The effect of such an agreement is quite understood ; and its principle has long been acted on by the Ras-ul-Khima 0 Chief. It might perhaps be found the simplest and safest guarantee practicable for the object we now have in view; especially if the Chief deputed a recognized local Agent to reside at the station. * My letter hesitating to analyze the subject of diving rights on the Pearl Banks contains some passages which may in part be applicable to the question now discussed. Colonel Stewart has politely offered to permit me to visit the Arab Coast on the board Her Majesty's Steam Vessel Vigilant, provided the Officer Commanding find no objection. Should I thus at length findi an opportunity for personal communication with the littoral Chiefs, I mi^ht obtain/ro^ one and all of them, separately, agreements, binding them, at sea and on shore, to prevent, or give full redress for, intrusion on, or interference with, ovr Telegraphic Lines and Stations, in the Persian Gulf' 108. The Bombay Government recorded the following Resolution (No. md, page 136. 3248, dated 26th October 1864):— u Any investigation of the claims of His Highness the Imaum of Muscat on the one hand, and of the Chief of Rae-ul-Khima on the other, to dominion over Cape Mussendom, was never either intended or authorized, and would, if begun, probably tend to very difficu|t complications. It will be well therefore that the question be not raised, but that the Politi cal Resident obtain from the Chief of Ras -ul-Khima, and the littoral Chiefs, a general engage ment not to interfere in any manner with the operations of the Telegraph. This will answer every purpose which the British Government has in view/' * Bee Pi6cis on International Rivalry and Uritish Policy in the Persian Gulf, Chapter X.I 49 103. The Goverument of India entirely concurred in the views of the Bombay Government and approved of the orders which they bad issued (Letter No. 510, dated 16th November 1864). An agreement was accordingly obtained from the Trucial Chiefs engaging to respect and abstain from inter ference with the telegraphic operations in or near their territory (Aitchisons Treaties, Vol. X, page 137). An agreement was also signed by the Sultan of Maskat on 17th November 1864, permitting the British Government to construct telegraph lines in territories appertaining to Maskat and engaging to abstain from interference in telegraphic operations in or near Maskat territory (Aitohison's Treaties, Vol. XI, page 74). 110.

Koomzar, the village of the alleged aggressor, is marked on the map close to the Cape Mussendum. 5. Now Government will observe that loth parties are politically included under Muscat jurisdiction. While in point of locality, both parties are situated in the Gulf. The complainant evidently looks to the Resident for justice. And if I do not interlere, the next phase of the quarrel may be an encounter at sea ; and a pretention founded thereon by the other Arab Sheikhs to take the law into their own hands. 6. I am not authorized, however, under present arrangement, to do more than refer the paities to the Political Agent at Muscat. 7. I have submitted to Government my opinion, that their relations with Muscat would be most conveniently conducted under the control of their Resident in the Persian Gulf. 8 The Muscat jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf is of two descriptions ; first territory forming part of the Muscat Dominion proper, as Koomzar and Khussub s second territory like Kishm, Bassidore, etc., farmed hy Muscat from the Shah.

We might here revert to the fact that in 1860 Captain Eelix Jones surrendered one of the culprits, a native of Khussab, concerned in the piracy case, referred to in Chapter VI (1) above to the Sultan of Maskat, on the ground that he was a subject of the Sultan. 113.

QUESTION OF JURISDICTION OVER THE COAST FROM DIBB4 TO RHOR RALHA, AND THE TERRITORY ABOUT RAS MUSSENDOM, 1876-1903.* (i; ATTEMPTS OF THE CHIEF OF FAJEIRA TO THROW OFF THE YORE OF THE JOASMI CHIEFS, 1876—1883. 114. On the death of Sultan bin Saggar, the Joasmi Chief, in 1866, tribute paid by Abdullah bin Khamis, Chief of Sharkiyyin village of Enjaira, ■was discontinued. Some time after, Chief of Shargah (Sheikh Salim-bin- Sultan) put a garrison into town of Dibba of the Nakbiyyin Sliarkiyyin. The Sharkiyyin formed confederacy under the Sheikh of Fujaira, and entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with Sbihiyyin under Saleh bin Muhammad, Chief of Bey ah. The Joasmi garrison of Dibba plundered Shihiyyia, on which Shihiyyin and S'harkiyyin besieged the fort and stopped passes. The Sheikh of Shargah sent his brother to Dibba, who arransred things amicably. The Gov ernor of Dibba, however, soon seized 12 men of Ghereyfah, Sharkiyyin village near Dibba. The Shihiyyin and Sharkiyyin on this again stopped passes and besieged the fort. Sheikh Salim of Shargah then sent 50 men, with provisions and munitions of war, to Dibba by sea, and prisoners were shipped to Shargah. Sharkiyyin and Sbihiyyin attacked the fort: some men were killed H, M. S. Aral arrived at Dibba and stopped fighting there, but 800 Joasmis reached Ghereyfa from Shinas direction and took fort at Ghereyfa, killing 36 and taking 30 prisoners. The Sheikh argued that sending reinforcements, etc., by sea to part of his own territory was not contrary to maritime truce. Maskat instigation was suspected. The Eesident remarked— ,c Experience has shown that, as soon as armed bodies of Arabs-are on the open sea, they forget the original object with which they started, and not only commit depre dations on any unprotected boats that they may meet, but involve other tribes in the quarrel.' The Resident recommended that the Shargah expedition should be forbidden. (Letters from the Officiating Resident, Colonel Prideaux, dated 4th November 1876, 29th January 1877 and 18th May 1877.) 115. No orders appear to have been passed by the Government of India , on these reports, which cannot be traced Political A, May 1881, os. - . recor( j s&gt; Copies of them were submitted to Government in 1880. 116. In April 1879, the Chief of Eajaira on the East Coast of Oman r . i complained to the Sultan of Maskat that Political A, September 1879, os. * • . the Joasmi Sheikh Salim-bin-Sulran had visited Eajaira with an army, ill-treated his people and seized and sent some of them to the Island of Abu-Musa. The Sheikh of Fajaira therefore sought to be placed under the protection of the Sultan of Maskat. 117. The matter was referred by Seyyed Turki to Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, Political Agent. Maskat, the Sultan claiming sovereignty over Eajaira. Lieutenant- Colonel Ross (the Resident) expressed the opinion that the place had been under the authority of the Joasmi Chiefs since the time of Sultan- bin-Saggar, and that there was no reason for our interference. The Govern ment of India was inclined to accept this opinion, but wished that it should be explained to the Sultan of Maskat and it should be ascertained whether he had any reasonable grounds for demurring to it (No. 2020, dated 1st August 1879). • Further correspondence is summarised in the Precis on International Rivalry and British Policy in the Persian Gulf \52 118 The view expressed by the Sultan of in his letter dated 25th September 1879, must be uoted s as Political A, November 1879, Nos. 251-254. tac J t | v admits the right of the Joasmi Chief to tribute from the Sheikh of Fajaira. Its translation is quoted below:— The tract of country alluded to above is not the country of the Joaemis, neither has it been a possession of theirs at any time. It is an independent tract between the two countries neither belonging to one or the other. It is probable an agreement was drawn up between myself and Hamad bin Majid, but it went no further. My object in the correspondence that has passed and at the present moment has not been to claim a right of sovereignty over Faievrah, so that it may be a grievance against me, but throughout our request to the bovern- ment of India was to prevent the usurpation of this tract of country as a^ possession by the Joasmi Chief. The tribute which it has been customary for Fajeyrah to pay the Joasmis is, we are of opinion, still their due, but the act of Salim bin Sultan m seizing on the country and fort as a posseBsion and driving its Chief and nobles into exile, is in no way justifiable. If it is possible for the great Government to prevent the annexation of this st ^jP country by the Joasmi Chief, and letting it remain as heretofore a tributary State, it will be reckoned to them as justice which they are ever anxious to see administered, but if it cannot be, it matters not, and we beg your consideration for the trouble we have given you in the matter. 119. In January 1880 the Political Agent, Maskat, reported tbat on the Joasmi Chief seizing Fajeyrah, Hamad- Political A. February 1880, Nos. 343-344. bin. Abdullah had fled and sought refuge in Maskat, that he had, however, recently left Maskat and succeeded in retaking it partly by treachery. 120. The Joasmi Chief then asked permission to send an expedition by sea _ i... , . „ 1Qfi1 Kna 9a , on to take Fajeyrah. On a report from the o i Ka , ay , . . Resident, the Government of India asked for report on the following points (No. 922-E.P., dated 5th May 1881):— (1) the circumstances, under which Fajeyrah was wrested from the Shargah Chief, (2) the nature and extent of the Joasmi rights on the eastern coast of the Cape, (3) if the Shargah Chie.f was unable to advance by land to his territory (if any) on this coast, and if any place belonging to him there was wrested from him by means of a naval expedition, as appeared to be the fact in this case^ whether the policy of Maritime Truce ought to be rigidly enforced, inasmuch as under certain circumstances a rigid adherence to it may press unfairly upon a Chief whose possessions do not happen to be compact. 121. Colonel Boss's report No. 97, Political A., July 1881, Nos. 64-67. dated 26th May 1881, on these points is printed below:— No. 97, dated Busbire, the 26th May 1881. From—LiBnrENANT-CoLONBt B. C. Ross, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Her Majesty 's Consul-General for Fars, etc., To—A. C. Ltaii , Esq., C.B., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge your letter No. 922-E .P., dated 5th instant, and to submit the report therein called for regarding Shargah and Fajeyrah. 2. The question of allowing or forbidding the Chief of Shargah to send an expedition by sea to coerce the present occupants of Fajeyrah can, as the case now stands, be discussed and disposed of before proceeding to the description of the history and political status of Fajeyrah for having, since my previous reference to Government was written, had interviews with the Chief of Shargah, that Shaikh, instead of pressing for the permission I had understood him to desire, disclaimed all intention or wish to operate by sea, but preferred other requests which I will mention further on. From the conversation that passed, it was clear that Shaikh Salim made no doubt of his ability to send forces to the territory in question by land. When 1 further explain that the complaint of this Chief that Fajeyrah was captured from the sea, with the aid of external enemies, is not warranted by the facts, I think enough will be said to show that no great hardship would befall the Chief of Shargah by the prohibition of operating by sea, and tbat such prohibition would not necessarily constitute a claim for British interference in his favour.53 3. I now proceed to describe the main features of the Fajeyrah question. 4. The strip of sea coast of the Batinah in which Fajeyrah is situated extends from Dibba to Khor Kelbah, a distance of about forty-five Bombay Government Selections, Nos. 24-P., rniles. It appears to have formerly formed part 134, and 127. 0 f the Muscat territory, and was forcibly taken possession of by the Joasmi Chief Sultan-bin-Sakar, just fifty years ago. An appeal seems to have been made at the time to the British Government by the Sultan of Muscat, but though a naval force was sent to 'preserve the integrity ' of His Hignness's dominions, for some reason Government declined to interfere to compel restitution of this slice of territory treacherously filched apparently by the Joasmi. But a fuller history of the matter, if available, would probably show that some flaw existed in the Muscat title to the territory. Of this however I find no record. 5. The question of the status of this territory may therefore be regarded as a three- cornered one. The Muscat State has a dormant claim, the Joasmi Chief claims it as a possession, whilst the people seek to play the one against the other and secure virtual independence. 6. As the disputes which have of late years arisen have been chiefly about the village of Fajeyrah, in this report 1 will speak of Fajeyrah only, though some of the remarks would apply to the whole strip of coast above described. 7. The title to possession of Fajeyrah may be considered as between (1) Muscat and Shargah, and (2) between Shargah and the inhabitants. 8. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee in 1879 wrote to the Political Agent at Muscat, stating that the Fort of Fajeyrah had been built by his ancestor, Seyyid Sultan-bin-el-Imam Ahmed, who made it over to the inhabitants to guard. His Highness however did not claim a right of sovereignty over the place or people, but appealed against Shargah being allowed to hold possession. In forwarding the correspondence to the Government of India, I expressed an opinion that Faieyrah had been subject to the Joasmis from the time of Sultan-bin-Sakar (Su^ar), and that there was no reason at the time to interfere. The Government ot India, whilst inclining to accept this view, directed it to be explained to Seyyid Toorkee, in view to ascertaining whether His Highness had any reasonable grounds for demurring to it. In reply His Highness reiterated bis opinion that 'the tract of country ' was not a possession of Sharo -ah, but 5 thought tribute was due by Fajeyrah to the Joasmi Chief. The Shargah Shaikh ^holds a paper sealed by Seyyid Toorkee, dated 1871, stating that all the territory west of Khor Kelbah, except Khasab, belonged to the Joasmi, but Seyyid Toorkee repudiates this document on the score that it was written before he was Sultan, and was to be a return for certain promised services which were never performed. On the whole, it appears that the Sultan of Muscat has not adequate grounds for interfering in the affairs of tajeyrah, but his opinion and his wishes are entitled to weight and deference. 9. There seems no question of complete independence of Fajeyrah, a position which would, if attainable, be undesirable in the general interests. 10 The relations between Fajeyrah and Shargah have next to be described. In the time of the Joasmi Chief Sultan-bin-Sakar, the local Chief of Fajeyrah, used to pay a fixed annual tribute to him. On Sultan-bin-Sakar's death the tribute was stopped. _ Later the present Chief of Shargah sent a force to garrison Dibba, and establish his authority over the district The inhabiting tribes, called Sharkieen, were averse to this proceeding, and leagued themselves to resist under the Chief of Fajeyrah, and formed an offensive and defensive alliance with the Shihiyeen tribe, nominlly subjects ot Muscat. These allies besieged Dibba and the Joasmi garrison applied for reinforcements. As the mountain passes were held by the Shihiyeen, Shaikh Salim sent his brother to Dibba to negotiate, and a reconciliation was effected, and tribute paid by the Sharkieen. Some time afterwards the Governor of Dibba seized twelve of the Sharkieen, and this caused a fresh combination and siege ot Dibba in 1876. On this occasion Shaikh Salim, without permission, relieved the garrison ot Dibba by sea. A force was sent by land also, and fighting occurred. Her Majesty s S. Arab appeared before Dibba, and recommended cessation of fighting, and as regards Dibba this advice was followed. In spring 1679, the inhabitants o£ F a ]eyrah expelled a Governor named Seroor. who had been appointed by the Shaikh o£ Sharaah, and set np one Marzoog without consnltine Shargah. Afterwards a deputation o£ l ajeyrah people was sent to Shargah to inform the Chief of the measure. The six members of the deputation were imprisoned, and the Chief prepared to send an expedition by land to punish the Fajeyrah people. It was suoeess- f ul and the fort of Pajeyrah was garrisoned by Biluchis. One of the local Shaikhs of I' ajuvrab Hamad-bin-Abdullab-bin-Saif, who had previously offended the Chief of Shaigah, Bed to Muscat, whence he returned, and, aided by those disaffected towards Shargah, gained posses sion of the fort of Fajeyrah. In this affair eight of the Joasmi garrison were slain. The Chlf of Shargah complained that Hamad -bin-Abdullah had been allowed to move by sea, but although he personally returned from Muscat by sea, and was no doubt secretly by Muscat, there was nothing o£ the nature o£ a naval expedition nor any active support. . « i. ^ 11. In this situation, the requests made personally to me by the Chief of SW^h jere (1) that be should be allowed to send a force by land to retake F a jeyrah (2) that a Bnti3h man -of -war should be sent to Fajeyrah to support ^3 authority ; an „ Muscat should be restrained from supporting Hamad-bin-Abdullah. Whilst disclai „ y 4433 F. D.54 right to prevent the Shargah Chief operatinsr by land, I was unwilling to appear to eneouraff© the plan, and therefore advised hina to endeavour to effect his object by negotiations ai d asked him to defer action pending further inquiry which I proposed to institute In the meantime an excellent opening for a peaceable solution occurred in an offer of the people of Fajeyrah to submit to the arbitration of the Chief of Ras-el-Khymah, who is himself a Joasmi and the consent of that Chief to mediate. 1 intimated my approval of this proposal both to bhargah and Ras-el-Khymah on the understanding that tie basis of settlement would he the submission of Fajeyrah to Shargah as the suzerain power, and the payment of the customary tribute vn, future. Letters just received from the Ras-el-Khymah Chief on the subiect are attached in translation, which will show how the matter stands. . \ 21 ' After 80rae further correspondence the Government of India in their letter No. 2188-E.P., dated 17th September 1881, approved of Colonel Miles proceedings in discouraging the proposal made to him by Wazir Seyyed Said regarding the interference of Maskat in the affairs of Faieira and accepted Colonel Hoss' view— f ' Uat the portion of the coast of Oman between Dibba and Khor Kelba should he con sidered subject to the operation of the maritime truce.' It was observed also— ' It is presumed that the eastern side of Cape Mussendum down to Dibba is regarded bv you as being on the same footing.'* uu ™ &amp; draea oy p .. . . . 122.

He had previously visited Braimi. His son Khalifa paid a visit to Bahiein and received a present of two horses from the Chief., The pearl-fishing was satisfactory. 1883-84 . . . Heavy gales were experienced in February and March 1 and several boats were wrecked; a bad form of malaria prevailed during the year causing many deaths. The pearl-diving was fairly productive and a new bank was discovered in three fathoms south of Halul island. 1885-86 . . . Results of the pearl-fishery on the Pirate Coast were poor and 250 divers were reported to have died from deep diving. 1886-87 • . . The pearl-fishing was unsatisfactory. The boats of the Pirate Coast proceeded to the Red Sea for pearl-fishing. 1889-90 . . • Residency a^ent furnished the following estimate of the number of pearl-fishing boats sailing from the Pirate Coasts :— Eamss . . * Ras-el-Khima . • Jezirat-el-Zab .

The Arabs proceeded to the Ceylon fisheries to offer themselves as divers in lb89-90 and 1890-91. Locusts appeared at Shargah in May 1890 and did much damage. Influenza prevailed in the spring and carried away several people. Heavy storms passed over the coast and caused much damage. 1891-93 . • • Chief of Ras-ul-Khima opened a custom house for the taxation of imports in June 1891. The pearl-fishery season was long and more than usually remunerative, each boat having earned more than §1,000 per boat. 1892-93 . • • Iti September 1892 the Chief of Debai visited the Sultan of Maskat, returning overland thence to Bereimi where he married into the Albu-Shams sept of the Nairn tribe. 1893-94 . . . Cholera prevailed on the Pirate Coast at the end of the hot season and disappeared in October 1892, after causing consi derable mortality. 1894-95 . • • Outbreak of dengue fever occurred in the early part of the pearl-fishery season. The outbreak of fever prevented many of the divers going as usual to the pearl banks. This reduced the take of pearls. 1895-96 . • • The Chief of Debai with a son of the Chief of Abu Thabi visited the Sultan of Maskat, with what object it is not known, though there were various rumours. A serious fire broke out at Debai in August 1895, destroying 60 houses, only one life was lost.59 Year.

We have dealt in Chapter XI with the inter-tribal wars on the Mussendom Peninsula between the Chiefs on the East Coast of Oman with the Joasmi Chiefs on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf from 1876 to 1888. We shall now proceed to give a synopsis of tribal fends and fights on the Arab Coast from Tibbat to Abu Thabi. We shall generally exclude from this chapter the feuds of the Trucial Chiefs with the Arab tribes in the Katar Peninsula, which have been dealt with in the Katar Precis. 132. The petty Chiefs on the Pirate Coast have been very prone to quarreling amongst themselves, but all legitimate influence, when^ opportunity offered, has been brought to bear to persuade them to settle their numerous disputes rationally without recourse to arms, and interchanges of visits have occasionally been promoted by the Government Agent with good result. It may be well to remark here that the dissensions which have occurred owed their origin in most instances to Administration Report for 1874-75, page 2. pecuniary difficulties, whether arising out of claims for the price of blood of murdered kinsmen or dependents for the restitution of bankrupt refugees tor indemnification on account of mis cellaneous losses, or other causes; and that when money was forthcoming appeal to arms was avoided always, provided the cause of quarrel was such as to be capable of adjustment by pecuniary payment. 133. We subjoin below a synopsis of the tribal fights and feuds in the shape of a statement, based on the facts narrated in the Gulf Eesidency Administration Heports:— Years, Parties to the feuds or wars. Events. 1873-74 The Chief of Shargah with the Chief Ejman, Alleged want of faith on the part of the Chief of Shargah and his refusal to pay just demands of money due caused feuds. versus The Chief of Debai suffered a defeat with loss of about 50 men.

Beni Yas of Abu Thabi versus Numerous expeditions undertaken, but result undecisive. Shargah and Umra-ul-Kowein agreed to a truce through the mediation of the Chief of Himriyah. Two hundred Beni Yas burnt Khabal and killed 10 Naims. Two hundred mounted Manasir and Beni Hajar attacked Dharij, town of Nairn Sheikh. Two hundred Manasir and Mazaria horsemen made fruitless expedition to Braimi. Constant raids by Beni Yas of Abu Dhabi and Debai, assisted by Munasir and Beni Hajar, on Nairn of Beraimi and environs of Zauj. Beni Katab sought protection of Debai against Munasir and Beni Hajar. Chief of Debai with Muhammad bin Saif, cousin of Sheikh Zaid, and 600 camels went and protected Beni Katab till assurances received from Abu Dhabi. One hundred Naim camelmen attacked Debai from west, simultaneously with Shargah and Ejmaa from east, and did some damage, returning to Shargah in the evening. Two hundred Abu Dhabi camel-riders raided Himriyeh, then with Chief of Debai, carried off many animals from gardens of Fasht and Shargah. Shargah caravan plundered en route to Batina. Peace between Shargah and Debay, Constant raids were committed. At last weary of strife, the parties arranged a general truce. Disturbances occurred between the Nairn tribe near Braimi, and the Shargah and Ejman Sheikhs espoused opposite causes and afforded active support to their respective friends. Sheikhs of Ejman, Ras-ul-Khima and Umm- ul-Kowein formed offensive and defensive alliance, but no actual hostilities reported. Sheikh of Ejman himself proceeded to Braimi. Chief of Shargah then concluded fresh treaty with Chief of Abu Thabi. The faction favoured by Ejman had apparently the best of the dispute.

Tired of the oppression of the Chief of Debai, 400 of the A1 Morrah trihe took refuge in Shargah. The rival claims were adjusted through the mediation of the Chief of Aim Thabi and the influence of Mr. Gaskin. The Resident, Colonel Wilson, had during his visit to Debai to the Pirate Coast in April 1894 specially impressed upon the Chief of Debai the desirability of settling matters. In April 189 i, the Chief of Abu Thabi marched to Bereymi and was joined th^re by Hashar-bin- Maktum from Debai with 300 camelmen and 30 horsemen. He then stormed and retook the village of ^Ain from Saud-bin-Harar, Early in June the Sheikh proceeded on a visit to the Sultan of Maskat. The opportunity was taken to arrange a difficulty that had arisen owing bo the omission of the Sultan's Wali of Sohar to give the customary presents to certain visitors from the Beni Katab and Naim tribes. In former years under such circumstances these tribes would have invaded and plundered the country until their claims had be^n satisfied. Owing, however, to the good offices of the Chief of Abu Thabi, the Bedouins abstained from their usual course of action. Peace was established between the Chief of Abu Thabi and the 'Al-Bu-Karuban section of the Naim at Bereymi, and he married the daughter of the holder of that fort. Chief of Ejman sent a boat with 12 armed men to the assistance of the Debai Chief. This breach of maritime peace was punished by a fine, which was levied during the Resident's tour in November 1892. In March 1892, a party of Debai subjects crossed over to Sir Abu Mudir Island, which belongs to Shargah and prevented the Joasmis there from fishing. The Residency Agent, under oiders from the Resident, ordered the withdrawal of the intruders, and that permission of the Chief of Shargah should be obtained before using the island as fishing ground. At the instance of the Chief of Abu Thabi, one of the Joasmi towns, Hair by name, was attacked and destroyed by the Shoohooh tribe. In January 1895, the Monasir and Al-Morrah tribes raided into the Beni Yas territory and carried off about 400 camels and 100 horses. The Chiefs of Abu Thabi and Debai prepared to check them, and the former moved troops to protect the Beni Katab tribe, who had applied to him for assistance. Raids were committed by the tribes into Abu Thabi territory and they then took refuge iu Shargah territory. The tribes were defeated in a battle. Abu Thabi.63 Years. Parties to the feuds or wars.

For a series of years one prevailing cause of strife and dispute - . . ▼ 1, io^q ^ a a ' i/tR between the Trucial Chiefs in the Per- Political A, November 1879, Nos. 44o-448. • /-. ip i i i ,1 i • u sian Gulf had been the asymm given by- one Chieftain to runaway debtors from another Chieftainship. The runaways almost in e^ery instance being divert, sailors or speculators, who having received advances of money from the traders of one port set out to the pearl fisheries, and instead of returning to give an account of their earnings, seek refuge in another port in order to defraud their creditors If the Chieftain affordiug refuge to the runaway debtors was on friendly terms with the Chieftain of the port from whence the debtors had absconded, an arrangement was generally come to between the Chiefs themselves. 134. But as was most often the case, if the interested Chieftains were not on friendly terms, the runaways were secure till such time as a subject of the protecting Chief absconded to the refugees' country, when references were made to the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government Agent on the Arab coast, or an Assistant Resident was deputed to enquire into their several complaints, and much time elapsed aiid trouble given before a satisfactory arrangement is arrived at. 135. In some instances the runaway debtors used to engage their services to other tradespeople and receiving a second advance would proceed to the pearl banks to work for their new employer leaving their first creditors' claims un settled, who on receiving information of the fact would waylay him and endea vour to get possession of his person, when a r^k of the breach of the peace at sea would follow, as boats of either creditor would be present and would join in any affray that might take place. 136. With a view to prevent any disturbance of this nature, Colonel Lewis Pelly, then Resident in the Persian Gulf, did, in 1868, issue a circular to all the Trucial Chieftains pointing out the injustice of their affording asylum to absconding debtors, and warning all Chiefs that borrowers thus levanting would have to be given up by the protecting Chief, and that every endeavour would he made to secure payment, but that if these measures failed, the harbouring Chief would be held responsible for their debts. 137. Notwithstanding this threat, instances of levanting continued to occur from year to year, and the troubles of settlement to increase owing to the com plicated nature of the claims and counter-claims set forth by their several cre ditors rendering an arrangement difficult and laborious. 138. Finally, the protecting Chiefs turned their attention towards utilizing the advent of runaway debtors into a source of emolument by only allowing those runaways to take employment who would grant a fee for the permission, thus rendering their burden heavier and the means of effecting an ariangemont more difficult. Complaints became more rife, and threatened to disturb the peace of the sea, unless measures could be adopted to put an effectual stop to the practice. 139. With this view the Resident in the Persian Gulf proposed to the Trucial Chiefs the execution of a mutual agreement whereby their subjects would be deterred from absconding and obtaining asylum is another Chieftain's territory, and that this agreement should be rendered binding by stipulations and tines.64i 140. The Tmcial Chiefs readily consented to these suggestions, and an agreement was drawn out and sealed by them in the presence of Hajee Abdur Kahraan, Government Agent, Arab Coast, and Hajee Abdul Cassim, Residency Moonshee, who was specially deputed to explain to the several Chiefs the Resi dent's views and wishes in this matter. Terms of a mutual agreement entered, into hy the Trucial Chiefs of the Oman Coast through the medium of HlJI ABDUL cassim, moonseee, especially deputed on this service, and HA ji A bdur B aeman , Government Agent, Arab Coast, written on the 3rd Eajeb 1296, corresponding with 24th June 1S79. Since it is to the interest o£ all the Trueial Chiefs to combine mutually for the pre vention of their subjects absconding- for fraud from one territory and taking asylum in another, especially as regards divers and sailors. On this account we, whose seals and signatures are attached to ihis document, hereby agree and bind ourselves in the presence of Haji Abul Cassim, Residency Moonshee, specially deputed for giving effect to this object and Haji Abdur Rahman, Government Agent, to give aid in every way possible in preventing such runaways from obtaining aid or asylum in our countries. Therefore, in accordance with this agreement, we consent— 1st. —In the event of a runaway seeking refuge in our territories, whether by sea or land, to consider it our duty to at once restore him to the Chief from whose jurisdiction he may have absconded. 2nd. —In the event of its being proved that a runaway is protected by any Chief, and not delivered up, or his liability accepted when demanded by the Government Acjent, such Chief shall be liable to a fine of 50 dollars in addition to all just claims proven against such runaway. 3rd. —Further, if the Chief harbouring such runaway refuse to deliver him up or accept his liability when demanded by the Government Agent, and permit him to proceed to the pearl banks in pursuance of his vocation, such Chief shall be liable to a fine of 100 dollars in addition to all just proven claims against the runaway. 4th. —When facts are disputed a council of arbitration (mejlis) will be convened^ at which the Government Agent will preside, the disputing parties and all the Trucial Chiefa sending delegates, or if they wish, attending themselves. The decision of the council to be binding only when confirmed by Her Britannic Majesty's Political Resident in the Persiau 5^.—These fines are only to be enforced when Her Britannic Majesty's Resident in the Persian Gulf has satisfied himself that the Chief complained against is really in fault and fairly liable. We therefore have written and put our signatures and seals to this document consenting and binding ourselves to carry out this agreement without opposition. P reliminary. Gulf. Correct. (Sd.)

Commander J. Elliot Pringle of the Vulture cruised round the Arab Coast in September 1879 with a view to impress upon the Chiefs the importance of acting loyally by the agreement. All the Chiefs recognized the utility of the measure. Only the Chief of Debai protested against having to go to Shargah when the delivery of absconding debtors of other tribes was claimed from him. He wished that such claims should be settled at Debai. Commander Pringle saw no objection to humouring this Chief by holding the mixed Court when he was concerned at Debai, which was only 7 miles from Shargah. It does not appear however that this proposal has ever been acted upon. 142. The Government of India wished to be satisfied that if surrender was absolutely enforceable, under the sanction or guarantee of Government, it would not be used as an engine of oppression by the Chiefs against oppression. 143. Colonel Ross pointed out that oppression was rare under the patri- Poiitioal A, January 1880, Nos. 333-335. archal system of rule obtaining among the Arab tribes, and that surrender would be demanded as a rule only in the case of really fraudulent debtors. The arrangement would not moreover apply to a large body of a tribe seceding from a Chief or emigrating. It is true that extradition of absconding debtors was not the practice among civilized States, but on the Arab Coast the practice of giving refuge to runaway defaulters was a source of constant feuds, which threatened the maritime peace, and the agreement now signed by the Chiefs would, it was expected, remove that source to a great extent. 144. In the Gulf Residency Admioistration Report for 1880-81 (Part I), Colonel Ross reported that the arrangement entered into in 1879 among the Trucial Chiefs appeared to have had a pacifying influence and no evil effects from the measure had been observed. 145. The Resident visited the Arab Coast in 1882, and reported that the Political a , June 1882, No. 254. tranquillity of the past years was consider ably due to more prompt settlement of this class of disputes, and there was no sign of the working of the arrangement injuriously affecting any honest members of the communities; on the contrary, it tended to their good. The various Chiefs had been fairly observant of their agreement at the instance of the Native Agent. 146. The Chiefs of Shargab, Debai and Ejman, who had succeeded to their External A, March 1893, Nos. 120 -123. Chiefships since the conclusion of the agreement of 1879 between the Trucial Chiefs regarding the rendition of absconding debtors, subscribed to it in 1892. (iv) INFLUENCE OF THE SHEIKH OF ABU THABI IN THE HINTERLAND OF THE PIRATE COAST. 147. In his letter No. 176, dated 28th June 1904, Major Cox drew our Secret E., September 1904, Nos. 53-54. attention to the preponderant influence which the Sheikh of Abu Thabi has been recently exercising in the Hinterland of the Pirate Coast. This Chief had concluded agreements with the inland Bedouin tribes such as Beni Katb, Ghofleh, Khavater, etc. When Major Cox travelled from the Pirate Coast to Maskat in 1902—see account in Chapter XIII, post —he found that Siieikh Zaid's influence was much stronger than that of the Sultan of Maskat throughout the Dhahireh district of Oman and was, as far as one could judge, exercised in the interests of general peace. 4433 F. D.67 CHAPTER XIII. BRITISH RELATIONS WITH THE TRIJCIAL CHIEFS. 148. In this chapter we shall deal with such events on the Arab Coast as have bearing upon the British relations with the Trucial Chiefs, from 1873 to 1905, mz., new engagements entered into by them, enforcements of treaties, defining their inter-national status, etc. (i) SLAVE TRADE. \ 149. In 1873 the Chiefs of Shargah and Abu Thabi wrote to the Resident, assuring him that proper measures would be taken to carry out the terms of the Slave Trade Treaty. (Aitohison's Treaties, Volume X, page 139.) Details of the slave trade with the Pirate Coast are treated in the Slave Trade Precis. (11) ARMS TRADE. 150. As to arms trade see Arms Trade Precis. (ill) MARITIME IRREGULARITIES, 1873-84. 161. Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum of Debai was a person of, even for an Gulf Administrfttion Eeport for 1878-79. ^ rab ' singularly quick and impetuous temper, which led him occasionally to commit irregularities himself and to excuse them in his people. With con siderable obstinacy, and in spite of friendly remonstrances made in the first instance by the Resident and Agent as well as in opposition to the advice of his own relations, he neglected in 1878 demands for redress in three cases, in which his responsibility was fully established by evidence. (1) The first of these was a claim for indemnity due by Shaikh Hashar for illegal and unjust detention at Debai of a Persian vessel. (2) The second complaint established was an attack by Debai boats on a Persian boat at Delma Island, and abduction of a sailor there from, with other violence. (3) Thirdly, Shaikh Hashar had used undue and unjust harshness towards Indian traders residing at Debai, on false allegations. It was eventually necessary to enforce compliance with our demands by presence of one of Her Majesty's vessels of war at Debai. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, at the Resident's request, accompanied Captain Wodehouse, the Senior Naval Officer, in Her Majesty's Ship Teazer, and a satisfactory settlement was obtained. A suitable fine was imposed, and the boat which had been employed in the Delma aggression was burnt off the port. Shaikh Hashar thereon came to his senses and wrote a suitable and ample letter of apojogy, which was accepted, and the usual friendly relations resumed. The proceedings were approved by the Government of India. 162. In the month of June 1882, it was discovered that a number of boats Gulf Adminigtration Eeport for 1882-83. belonging to ^ Ajman had been con cerned m a piracy committed in a vessel (the Fath-el-Kareem, under Turkish colours) in the Red Sea, and a quantity of property plundered from the vessel was landed at Ajman. Steps were taken to detain the Ajman boats until the charge was clearly established, when Her Majesty's Ship Arab was sent to the Pirate Coast, and nine of the boats con cerned in the piracy were publicly burnt, and the value of a quantity of the cargo of the plundered vessel was recovered. 153. During the pearl-fishing season (June 1884) an Ejman boat was Administration Report for 1884-85. attacked and fired on by one Seif-el- Bxtemal a , September 1884, Nos. ia.16. Adham, who resided on the island of Sirri and who had previously behaved in a turbulent manner. The offence, whichconstituted a breach of the mariiime truce, having been clearly proved, Her Majesty's Ship Philomel proceeded with the Residency Agent for the Arab Coast to Sirri, and burned the boat of Seif-el-Adbam in a public manner. 154. la May 1884 the Government Agent reported that a Moolah, AdmrnUtration Report for 1884-85. residing at Shargab, named Hossein-bin. Temeem, was busying himself in favour of the soi disani Mahdi of the Soudan, advising the people of Shargah to join the Mahdi at Mecca and causing some excitement amongst them. The Agent was instructed to take no notice of the Moolah's sayings, but to caution the Chief of Shargah that he would be held responsible for any annoyance befall ing British subjects ensuing on such meddlesome attempts at agitation. (iv) PERSIAN ACTIVITY ON THE ARAB COAST, 1887-88; AGREEMENTS OBTAINED FROM THE CHIEFS BV THE RESIDENT. 155. The year 1887-88 was remarkable for attempts made by the Persian Government to pursue an aggressive policy in the Persian Gulf especially the Arab Coast, and assert Persian supremacy to the detriment of the British preponderance therein. 156. The leaders of the movement were Amin-es-Sultan, who held the reins of Government at Tehran, Sartip Haji Ahmed Khan, for some time a Deputy Governor of Bushire and Malek-ul-Tujar, a wealthy Persian merchant at Bushire, and an Anglophobe fortune-hunter who had held the customs and Government of Persian ports for some time. 157. In the month of August, whilst engaged in dealing with troublesome External a , Jane is? 8, Nos. 54 56. disorders in the vicinity of Bahrein, the External a, j uty Nos ^u^is. Besident (Colonel Ross) received inform- Golf Administration Report for 1887-88. ation th; t the Sart i p (Genei . al) Haji Ahmed Khan was about to visit Abu Thabi and other places on the Pirate Coast in the Bombay aod Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company's steamer Calder. Considering the expense entailed by this trip, and the season of the year at which it was undertaken, the Resident suspected that the object in view was not, as given out merely to pay a friendly visit to old friends, but must be of a more serious and important nature. The Residency steamer Lawrence was despatched with the Pirst Assistant Resident to Abu Thabi to observe the movements of the Sartip, and to endeavour to ascertain his purpose. It appeared that Haji Ahmed Khan landed at Abu Thabi in full unifoim and remained with the Chief a few days, after which he went to Debai, whence he again returned to Abu Thabi and finally sailed in a native vessel to Lingah. 158. The precise nature of Haji Ahmed's communication to the 'Oman Chief was not ascertained at the time, the ilaji having obtained promises that they would not divulge them to the British authorities. The Chief of Debai, however, whilst adhering to his promise literally, considered himself free to inform the Sultan of Muskat of Haji Ahmed's proposals, which were framed with a view to the establishment of close political relations between the inde pendent Chief of 'Oman and the Persian Government, to the exclusion of the present predominance of British influence. In whatever quarter the idea originated, it is certain that those who were at the time entrusted with the reins of power and practically directed the policy of the Persian Government, had nourished an ambitious dream of replacing British by Persian supremacy over the shores of islands round the Persian Gulf. The action of certain local Persian authorities, including Haji Ahmed, was calculated to arouse suspicion of some such scheme being afloat, and attention once drawn to these proceedings observation served to establish the correctness of the surmise, after which the proceedings of the Persian agents at tirst puzzling, became intelligible, and acquired a meaning and an interest. In the circumstances the Resident deemed it prudent and advisable, in order to safeguard our position in relation to the Trucial Arab Chief of 'Oman, as well as to impress on their minds their own obligations to the British Government, to obtain from those Chiefs written assurances of their imentiou of maintaining the existing status, which it was the object of Persian intrigue to disturb. Accordingly all the six Trucial Chiefs addressed the Resident letters containing assurances to the British Government that they would neither correspond with, nor form engagements69 with any other Foreign Gavernments, and would not, without assent of the British Government, consent to admit to reside in their territories, agents of any Government but the British. 159. In January 1883, Sartip Haji Ahmed Khan, having supplied him- External A, February 1888, Nos. 47-48. self witli a number of Persian Govern- a .00 ment fiass left Bushire on a special mis- Exterual A, August 1888, Nos. 447-482. . ,, . . Q &amp; sion. On this occasion the Sartip pro ceeded in a native vessel to a place on the promontory called Kas-el-Bibal, or Cape Musendim and desired to land, but was warned off by the Arab inhabit ants. Subsequently, accompanied by the Sheikh of Kishm and some armed men, he visited Umm-ul-Kawain causing much excitement amongst the Arabs of that coast. Haji Ahmed gave out that his object in visiting 'Oman again was of a personal nature, but his real purpose was no secret. He was utterly unsuccessful and returned in disappointment to Bunder Abbas The Persian Minister under whose orders the Sartip was acting on being questioned by Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, promptly and positively disavowed all knowledge of the Sartip's proceedings, and volunteered to reprimand him for his action. The Arabs of the Pirate Coast, being considerably fluttered by Haji Ahmed's appearance and conduct, were informed by the Commander of Her Majesty's Ship Osyrey, which vessel was despatched for the purpose to the coast, that the Persian Government had disavowed and disapproved Haji Ahmed's pro ceedings. The presence of the Os ^rey and the disclaimer of the Persian Government had a re-assuring effect on the minds of the Arabs of the Pirate Coast. It may be mentioned that Sartip Haji was subsequently presented with a sword of honour by order of the Persian Minister. 160. In view of the intrigues of the Persians on the Arab Coast, Colonel External A, August 1888, Nos. 579-671 Ross obtained agreements from the Chiefs [vide Nos. 613-617). of Abu Thabi, Eas-ul-Khima, Ejman, Umm-ul-Kowein, Shargah and Debai on various dates in December 1887, in which they bound themselves— (а) on no account to correspond or enter into an agreement with any Government whatever except the British; (б) without the assent of the British Government not to consent to allow an Agent of any Governmant except that of the British to reside within their dominions. 161. The Government of India sent these agreement to the Secretary of State (despatch No. 62, dated 24th April 1888), referring to them as assurances of their loyal adherences to their connection with the British Gov ernment, But no further action appears to have been taken. (v) INTRIGUES OF M. CHAPUY ON THE PIRATE COAST. TREATIES WITH THE TRUCIAL CHIEFS, 1893. 162. In 1891 a frenchman by name Chapuy, who had resided in various Proceedings of Chapuy. places in the Gulf for the past eiuht Secret E., July 1892, Nos. 24-25. years, '* half adventurer, half merchant and wholly intriguer,' as Colonel Ross described him, paid with another Frenchman named Thormy three visits to Umm-ul-Kowein, apparently for the purpose of purchasing shells, but really to gain an ascendancy over the Chief in Prench interests. 163. During his visits to Umm-ul-Kowein, M. Chapuy gave some valu able presents to the Chief and became very intimate with him. The Chief seems to have been deeply impressed with the power of Prance, inability of the British to interfere with dhows carrying Prench colours, and practical impunity with which the Sur boats about 30 in number carried slaves under the protection of the Prench flag. He seems to have welcomed with gratifica tion, proposals—evidently made by the Prench visitors—for a return to status ante quo, when his subjects carried on slave trade with so much profit, but which had been put a stop by the British. He went so far as to propose to write a letter to the Prench Government through the two Prenchmen stating that any one coming to his country from the Prench Republic would be gladly welcomed. 4433 f. d.70 164. Major Talbot then reported in'his s .oret E., July 1S92. Nos. 24-45. letter ligy, dated 19th October ] 8^2:— 'It will be in the recollection of Government that in 18S7, in consequence of the intrigues of certain Persian officials on tlie Arab Coast, my predecessor thought it desirable to obtain written assurances from the Trucial Chiefs that they would not enter into any agreement with another Power, nor permit a foreign agent to reside in their territories without the assent of the British Government, while they also declared their adhesion to previous engagements. These documents were forwarded to Government with my predeces sor's letter No. 18, dated l?th January 1H88, but no replv seems to 1 ave been received, and as they have not been ratified they may not be technically binding agreements. Mn any case, however, I would sugsest for consideration that it might be advisable to amplify these assurances by the conclusion &lt; f a fresh agreement embodying a provision against the cession hy the Chiefs of any portion of their terriories to any Power hut England. In my letter No. 152, dated 15th September 1H9!, 1 referred to the mischievous activity of M. Chapui and his partner, and I have since heard from the Residency Agent at Limcah that the Cliief of Umm-ul-Kawain has granted them a piece of land n^ar his own residence. This report still awaits confirmation by the A.&lt;jeiit at Shargah, but is not improbable as M. Chapui appears to have ingratiated himself with the Sheikh. ' It may be ur»ed thit M. Ciiapui is a mere adventurer, intriguing for his own ends, and that his actions, if overtly directed against us. would be promptly disavowed by the Fietich Government ; but 1 venture to think that it would be well to guard against the chance of hia receiving any encouragement from his own Government, to which he will, doubtless, mis represent the extent of his influence on the Arab Coast and the advantages to be gamed by supporting hicn. Apa't. moreover, from the question as affected by the actions of M. Chapui and the Chief of Umm-ul-Kawain, it would seem desirablejn view of the recent attitude of the Porte with regard to Odeid to anticipitte pretexts for any sort of interference by the Ottoman Government in the territories of the Trucial Chie's. With the view I submit a draft agreement, and I have included in it the substance of the one negotiated in 1887, for even if valid as it stands it only applies to the Chiefs then in power and does not bind their successors ' 165. The draft agreement proposed by Major Talbot was approved by the Government of India with slight emenda- No ' 32 ' tions (Foreign Department letter No. 1- C.C., dated 24tli November 18^1). 166. The proposed agreements were concluded with the Chiefs of Abu Tbabi, Debai, Ejman, Shargah, tlas-ul-Khima, as also the Sheikh of Bahrein on various dates in March 1892. 167. Under the new agreements the Chiefs bind themselves, their heirs and successors to the following conditions ;— (1) On no account shall any agreement or correspondence be entered into with any power other than the British Government. (2) Without the assent of the British Government, they shall not con sent to the residence within their territories of the Agent of any other Government. (3) On no account shall they cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territory save to the British Gov ernment. Her Majesty's Government approved of these proceedings (Secretary of Q c . ^ 1Q Q0 M 1K1Q State's despatch No. 27 (Secret), dated Secret E., September 1892, Nos. 15-18. July 1892) &lt;vi) SIGNING BY NEW CHIEFS OF AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THEIR PREDECESSORS, 1900. 168. 'When in 1900 the present Sheikh of Ejman usurped the Chiefship, he informed the Resident of his accession AFil 1901 ' NoS ' 91 ' 98 and that he had signed the agreements of his predecessors with the British Govern ment, promising at the same time to abide by them. The Resident wrote in reply expressing his pleasure at learning of the Chief's resolution. 169. There was no precedent for a proceeding like this, where a new Secet E., April 1901, Nos. 91-98. Chiet s T i S ned agreements of his predeces- sors. It was considered, Colonel Kembal reported, that a new Chief is bound at his accession by his predecessor's71 engagements. The Government of India endorsed the view of Colonel Kemball that the various ensragements which have been executed by individual Trucial Chiefs are necessarily binding on their successors. But Government thought that it is desirable to secure that each such successor is clearly acquainted with the provision of the agreements (No. 2369-E.A., dated 26th December 1900). (vii) JOIIRKEY OF MAJOR COX FROM THE PIRATE COAST TO MA SKAT, 1902. 170. In April 1902, Major Cox undertook a journey from the ?irate Coast to the Maskat Coast by the interior Gulf Administration Report for 1902 03. of 0man and sailed ^ ^ pur p 08e to Abu Thabi on H.M.S. Redbreast. 171. The utmost assistance and hospitality was afforded to him by Shaikh Zaid-bin-Kalifa, Chief of Abu Thabi, without whose cordial co-operation the first portion of the journey could not have been performed; and on disembarking the Political Agent, H.M.S. Jtedbreast returned to Maskat with a despatch requesting the Sultan to be so good as to send his trusted Lieutenant Sheikh Kashid-bin-Uzniz, Governor of Somail, or some other influential Shaikh, to meet the Political Agent at Ibri in the Dahireh. His Highness cordially and promptly responded and Shaikh Rashid duly kept tryst at Ibri on 14th May. 172. Some portion of the country passed through in the Dahireh district had not been visited before by a European, so far as is known and of the remainder of the route much had not been traversed for many years. 173. The principal places visited were Abu Thabi, |Bereymi, Hafit Dthank, Ibri, Nejd-ul-Makharim Gabrin, Behla, Nezwa, Tanuf, the villages, of the Jebel Akhdar range, Samail, Sarur, Bidbid, Finjah and so on to Maskat which was reached on 29th May. 174. No serious opposition was offered to the Political Agent's progress, and when the difficulties and occasional risks of first contact had been got over, and his identity and credentials made known, the villagers and Bedouins met with were uniformly friendly. The chief impediment to the security of travel in Oman, as in other parts of Arabia, is the suspicious nature ol; the bucolic Arab, who is ever ready to believe any exaggerated or lying story that may happen to get abroad regarding the identity and motives of the stranger sojourning in bis country. 174-A. The peasants were found to be much better armed in this, the northern half of Oman, than they are in the south ; in fact obsolete rifles were altogether at a discount. 176. Major Cox was much struck by the powerful hold of the Sheikh of Abu Thabi on the tribes in the Hinter- See Chapter XII (iv), anle. of ^ Coast- (vili) THE BRITISH RELATIONS WITH THE TRUCIAL CHIEFS, 1903. 176. Colonel Kemball in his letter No. 173, dated 12th December 1902, Secret e ., April 1903, nos. 195-196. reviewed our relationship with the Trucial (The report was the outcome ot the discussions Chiefs. He explained that our position in Secret e ., April 1901, Nos. 99-100) re g ar d to them is at least one of tacit predominance. Our overlordship so far as it refers to the maintenance of mari time peace, to the protection of our traders and to the observance by the Chiefs of their various engagements with us, is clear and is accepted by the Chiefs without demur. In regard to internal affairs our policy has been not to interfere unless internal disturbances led to breach of maritime peace or injury to British residents, but our predominant position on the Arab Coast enables us to offer advice in internal disputes, which is welcomed and obeyed cheerfully as a rule. In matters of succession, we refrain from formally recognizing a new Chief, but de facto successions are tacitly recognized by us. The Trucial Chiefs are in fact for all practical and necessary purposes under the British protectorate, and there appeared to Colonel Kemball no necessity for making this protectorate more formal. 177. No action was taken on this communication of Colonel Kemball.72 (ix) CLAIMS OF CERTAIN TRUCIAL CHIEFS AGAINST THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT. THE RIGHT OF THE BRITISH REPRESENTATIVES TO ACT FOR THEM, 1903. 178. In May the Resident requested Sir A. Hardinge to make representations to the Persian Government and secure restoration of certain arms of the Chief of Abu Thabi seized by the Customs officials, and satisfactory settlement of two other cases relating {a) to the alleged murder of Abu Thabi subjects on pearl banks by residents on the Persian Coast, {b) to a claim of the Chief of Shargah's uncle to date gardens at Lingah. The Government of India in requesting Sir A. Hardinge to interest him self in these matters, stated that the maintenance of the Resident's prestige as representative of the Trucial Chiefs in such cases was a matter of the highest importance (telegram, dated 9th June 1903). 179. On the 22nd June 1903 Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to us that the Grand Vizier had ordered the restoration of the confiscated arms of the Sheikh of Abu Thabi, and an enquiry into the two other matters. 180. It appears, however, that Sir A. Hardinge when writing to Colonel o , „ ^ ^ Kemball on 29th May 1903 was ignorant Secret E., October 1908, No.. 60.5o. of the agre( . ment3 si?ned by the Trucial Chiefs in 1892. The Resident therefore sent to him a copy of the agreements and stated that they gave the British Resident the right to represent cases on behalf of the Trucial Chiefs to the Persian authorities. 181. The Government of India endorsed this view and stated in their telegram, dated 26th August 1903, to the British Minister that under our treaties with the Trucial Chiefs our representatives have full rights of acting for them with the Fersian Government. 181-A. Sir A. Hardinge replied that being now in possession of a copy of Secret E., April 1901, No.. 46-4e. tbe agreements of 1892, he would, unless he received contrary instructions from the Marquess of Lansdowne, take the same line in the case of the subjects of the Trucial Chiefs properly so-called, as in the case of Bahreinese subjects, that i?, maintain the right of His Majesty's Legation to interfere in their behalf (despatch No. 34, dated 18th September lb03). (x) STATUS OF THE ARAB STATES FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE II OF THE ANGLO-PERSIAN DECLARATION OF 9TH FEBRUARY 1903. 182. In September 1903, apparently before he received our telegram, 14th _ ^ , mno AT September 1903 (see paragraph 180), Sir Secret F., December 1903, Nos. 50-61. * 1 tx i • j N i .1 rS i tt' • A. Hardinge addressed the Grand Vizier relative to the meaning of the expression ' countries placed under the protection Q i. 'p A l mno at OOHOTO of British Government' , for the Secret E., August 1903, Nos. 280-312. . 1 t» • m purposes of the Anglo-Persian Tariff Agreement of 1903. 183. He then held that it applied to ' countries not forming part of the British Empire, but whose foreign relations are to a greater or lesser degree regulated by the British Government and towards whom that Government has assumed certain special and definite responsibilities which may be conveniently summed up in the term protection.'' He further remarked:—' To take a concrete instance in the immediate vicinity of Persia, some of the petty Arab States on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf clearly come within the definition, and may properly be regarded as ' foreign ' for the purposes of the declaration of 9th February 1903.' 184. In 1904, with reference to a question raised by the Colonial Office c i. ri t i inn K xr nn on the status of the Federated Malav Secret E., July 1905, No. 119. n, , ti ^ • t , , / States, M. INaus conceived some doubts as to whether the sovereign power in those States was theoretically vested in the local Sultans or in His Majesty, this being in his view the point upon which the question whether they were a colony or a foreign protected country turned. 185. He explained that his object was to guard himself against making an admission which might commit him to the recognition as ' colonies '* entitled to grant England preferential treatment of such States as Afghanistan and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs.73 186. Sir Hardinge stated tliat he could not answer the points M. Naus had raised, but that it seemed to him that M. Naus' object would be attained if in a note recognising the Malay States as a colony for the purposes of the Anglo-Persian Declarations, he inserted a reservation to the effect that this admission would not bind Persia by analogy to apply it to the cases of Afghanistan and the Arab States of the Gulf in view of the peculiar relations which they occupied to the Government of India. 187. M. Naus also addressed a note, dated 22nd June 1904, to Sir A. Bardinge, in which he admitted that the Federated Malay States might, from an economic point of view, be considered as a g^m-dependency of British India, so that the question raised by the Colonial Office might be answered in the affirmative, with the reservation, however, that the consent of the Persian Government, as regards the said States, should not be taken as applicable to States placed under mrtial 'protection or under good offices. This reservation had special reference to Afghanistan and to the Arab States on the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. (xi) VISIT OF LORD CURZON TO THE PIRATE COAST AND THE DARBAR OF THE TRUCIAL CHIEFS AT SHARGAH, NOVEMBER 1903. 188. An account of Lord Curzon's tour in the Persian Gulf in November- Secret E., February 1904, Nos. 33-127 (vide December 1903 is givenl in the Precis No. 119). on International Rivalry and British Policy in the Persian Gulf Here we are concerned only with the Viceroy's visit to the Pirate Coast. His Excellency arrived on 21st Novem ber at Shargah, which had been selected as a central point at which the Arab Trucial Chiefs should be brought together to meet the Viceroy in the ceremony of a Darbar. The Chiefs of Abu Thabi, Shargah, Debai and Ejman, with their sons and the eldest son of the old Chief of Umm-el-Kowein had been collected in the Patrick Stuart from different parts of the coast, and the Darbar held, as at Maskat, upon the was a ceremony that could hardly fail to have left upon them a great impression. Lord Curzon addressed the Chiefs in a speech, which, as described in His Excellency's despatch No. 196 (Secret -External), dated 17th December 1903, is an epitome of the British history in the Arab waters of the Gulf during the past century. 189. In his speech to the Chiefs Lord Curzon after enumerating the engagements entered into between them and the British Government, pointed out:— « Chiefs, out of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent con stituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace, there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves, whereby the British Government iecame your overlords and protectors and you have relations with no other powers' There were reasons to fear. His Excellency said, that the record of the past was in danger of being forgotten. The British were in the Gulf before any other Power in modern times, had shewn its face in those waters, they found strife and have created order. They have saved the Arab Chiefs from extinc tion at the hands of their neighbours. They have preserved their indepen dence. They opened these waters to the ships of all nations. The British are not going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enter prise ; we shall not wipe off the most unselfish page in history. The British Government do not interfere in the internal affairs of the Chiefs, provided they govern their territories with justice and respect the rights 'of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occur, the Chiefs would always find a friend in the British Resident, who would use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions coming to a head and to maintain the status quo, for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evade the spirit of his treaty obligations. The Viceroy referred here to the Fajeira troubles, and expressed a desire that these disputes should cease and that peace should remain undisturbed. 4433 F. D.74 (Xii). WRECK OF A BOAT U1VDER THE FRENCH FLAG I\ THE TERRITORY OF THE SHEIKH OF DEBAI. COMMUNICATION OF THE TERMS OF THE TREATY OF 1893 TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT, 1904. 190. In March 1904 the Political Agent at Maskat telegraphed that the c 4. i? c 4- v. inn. at q« ^ Erench Consul there had been pressing Secret E., September 1904, Nos. 26-46. i, « ,i i , i it the Sultan to forward a strongly worded letter from him to the Sheikh of Debai on the Trucial Coast concerning a boat sailing under the French flag, alleged to have been wrecked and plundered in Debai territory. The Infernet was expected at Maskat shortly, and it was believed would proceed to Debai; Colonel Keraball believed that the French Consul was unaware of the engagements of March 1892, and pro posed to inform him expressing his willingness to make an enquiry and do his best to settle the matter if particulars were furnished. 191. The Government of India authorized the Political Agent to do as he proposed; but suggested to the Secretary of State the advisability of the situ ation being explained to the French Government. 192. The French Government appears to have been unaware of the Treaty with the Sheikh of Abu Thabi and agreed now to have the matter settled by the British Government without their settlement (Secretary of State's telegram, dated 15th April 1904). This was done in accordance with an award of a Kazi, fixing a certain amount of compensation. (xiii) DR. EBRAHIM EFFENDI OF SHARGAH AND HIS OFFER TO MARE SOME IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ABOUT AFFAIRS IN THE PIRATE COAST. 192-A. In February 1904, one Dr, Ebrahim Effendi visited Mr. Edgerley, a xr V mn. v -.^o cllief Secretary, Bombay Government, Secret E., November 1904, ]Sos. 152-159. ire i and offered to make some important dis closures affecting British prestige on the Pirate Coast, provided a guarantee was given for the protection of himself and his family and property. His information referred to bribery of local people and intrigues with them by a foreign Power. 192-B. On enquiry by the Resident and Political Agent at Maskat it was found that the man, originally a Jew, had become a Christian and served under the American Mission at Bahrein, had fallen out with the Missionaries and turned then a Mahomedan, and after some adventures at Lingah and Ras-ul- Khima had settled as a doctor at Shargah. He appears to have been on bad terms with the Residency Agent there. He had sought from the Porte an allowance for what he called his charitable work. It seemed doubtful ■whether he could give any valuable information beyond what is known to Government, and no guarantee for his and his family's safety could be given him than that the Resident would not allow him to suffer in case he gave information of value. This was not sufficient to encourage him further. (xiv) REFUSAL OF AN OFFER MADE BY HERR TOEPPEN TO SECURE AN ANGLO-INDIAN PROTECTORATE OVER AN UNNAMED CHIEF ON THE PIRATE COAST, 1904. 193. In August 1904, one Herr Toeppen, a German by race, but con- c i -p t -.nn- ^ o*. o** verted to Mahomedanism, wrote to Lord Secret E., January 1905, Nos. 374-376. ^ . , ,, t 1 j . i.r. t j- Curzon in a letter directed to the India Office, in which he laid stress upon his intimate acquaintance with the Arab Chiefs on the Pirate Coast, and stated that one of them sought for German protection, but that he (Herr Toeppen) could persuade this Chief to accept the Anglo-Indian protection. Herr Toeppen therefore offered his services for the purpose. 194. He was informed by the India Office that his letter to Lord Curzon had been placed before the Secretary of State for India, and that his proposal could not be accepted. (A. Godley to Herr Toeppen, dated 18th August 1904i.)75 CHAPTER XIV. * PERSIAN RELATIONS WITH THE ARAB CHIEFS ON THE PIRATE COAST. DISTINCTIVE TRUCIAL FLAG, 1899-1905. (i) CAPTURE OF LIWGAH FROM ITS JOASMI SHEIKH. PERSIAN COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SHEIKH OF RAS-UL-KHOIA HARBOURING THE EXILED SHEIKH OF LINOAH AND COMPANIONS, AND HIS ALLEGED INTENTION TO ATTACK LING AH, 189D-1900. 195. An account of the Joasnri Sheikhs of Lingah and their fall is given in Section XII of the Versian Coast and Islands Freois, 1854—1905. 196. On 14th October 1899 the British Minister at Teheran was informed f ■r. xt . _ xt ^ „ by the Sadr Azam that Sheikh Alsrined Secret E., November 1899, Nos. 5-7. j a • - j v £ i. n jx and Saiyid Yusur, who were alleged to have been responsible for the recent rising at Lingah, had escaped to the Arabian Coast, that the Shah feared that they might return with a new following, and hoped that the Indian Government would take such steps as could prevent their collecting men with a view to making a descent on Lingah. 197. The Government of India in this telegram, dated 21st October 1899, instructed the Resident to warn the Trucial Chiefs not to assist any schemes for an attack on Lingah, and to communicate to the Legation any information he might receive respecting such designs. 198. Again, in January 1900, the Persian Government complained that Secret E., March 1900, Nos. 176-185. ' Sheikh Mahomed had taken refuge at Secret E., May 1900, Nos. 53-59. Has-ul-Khima and been harboured by its Chief, and that the latter intended to make an hostile demonstration against Lingah in aid of Sheikh Mahomed. The Persian Government intended to take measure to chastise the Arab Chief, but before doing so asked the British Government to intervene. 199. The Resident, who was asked to report, stated that the Trucial Chiefs had been warned in October 1899 against assisting in any schemes for renewed attacks of Lingah, that the warning was repeated when Colonel Meade visited the Arab Coast in December. Sheikh Hamid of Ras-ul-Khima stated that Sheikh Mahomed's attack on Lingah was made against their wishes, and that they had lost in consequence properties which belonged to the tribe generally. Sheikh Hamid promised to conform to the Resident's advice and said that he would submit later on detailed claims for the property of Joasmi Arabs taken by the Persians in Lingah. The Resident then sent the Melpomene with a fresh warning to Sheikh Hamid to give up all idea he might have of making a descent on Lingah. The Commander of the man-of-war was also instructed to prevent any such attempt. On the other hand, the Darya Begi, the Resident thought, had not the means to attack Ras-ul-Khima effectively : any attempt to do so might result in the loss of the Fersepolis (Resident's telegram, dated 28th January 1900, to the British Minister at Teheran). 200. The Commander of the Melpomene conveyed the necessary warning to Sheikh Hamid and was informed that there was no foundation in the rumour about the intended descent on Lingah. Sheikh Mahomed was found at the time at Ras.ul-Khima. (ii) INTRIGUE OF THE DARYA BEGI, GOVERNOR OF BUSHIRE, WITH THE CHIEF OF ABU THABI. ADOPTION BY THE LATTER OF A GREEN FLAG. MEASURES FOR ADOPTION OF THE TRUCIAL FLAG BY THE ARAB CHIEFS AND THEIR SUBJECTS. 201. following the recent events at Lingah, we find the Sheikh of Abu Secret E, October 1900, Nos. 286-299. Thabi in communication with the Darya Begi, Governor of Bushire, and sending * As to Persian intrigues on the Arab Coast in 1887-88, see Chapter XIII (iv). f It mifrht be noted that by these complaints of the Persian Government to the British Minister, the British protectorate over the Trucial Chiefs was tacitly recognized by the Persian Government. IIr 76 him a present of two horses. In return the Sheikh received a sword and a firman from the Sadr-i -Azam, at the recommendation of the Darya i n recognition of the Sheikh's services and merits. The firman was read by the Sheikh at a Darbar. The Chief of Abu Thabi also adopted a green flag m place of an Arab flag he used to fly. . ^ # 202 Colonel Kemball having called upon the Chief to explain his pro ceedings, the latter stated that the cause of the recent intercourse between him and the Darya Begi was the high-handed proceedings of the Governor, when he captured Lingah, towards some Arabs of Abu Thabi, by which they had ten defrauded of a large sum of money due to them by a Persianj and the Sheikh desire to gain the protection of the Persian authorities. 203. The green flag was apparently adopted in order to distinguish the Abu Thabi boats from those of other Arabs and to secure their being interfered with by the Persian authorities. There was little doubt, however, that the Darya Begi's ulterior motive on the matter was to detach the Chiet, Abu Thabi, from the other Trucial Chiefs in connection with the recent events at Lin^ah, and as the action of the Persian Government had created a feeling of unrest among the other Trucial Chiefs, Colonel Kemball suggested to the Charge d'Affaires at Teheran that it might be as well to inform the Persian Government that in view of our existing relations with the Trucial Chiefs, any interference on the part of the Persian authorities m the affairs of these Chiefs was likely to give rise to complications which it would be advisable to avoid (Resident's letter, dated 7th July 1900). 204.
