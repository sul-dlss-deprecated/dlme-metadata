Both Governor of Aden and French Vice-Consul (who has just returned from Sana*a via Hajja Hodeida and Taiz) report that Yemen is quiet and Ahmed’s power securely established. I have therefore decided that our recognition should be delayed no longer and am submitting for King’s approval text of a message from His Majesty to Ahmed congratulating him on his accession and expressing friendly sentiments. -* 2. I propose that this message together with one from me to Yemeni Foreign Minister, should be telegraphed to Bana’a by Governor of Aden on April 21st. Please ask State Department if this date would be convenient to them. 3. French Netherlands and Italian Embassies here are also being informed of our intentions, and we expect that their Governments will take similar action, though we understand that French Government are anxious to recognise Ahmed on the 14th.
