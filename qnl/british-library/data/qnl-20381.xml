The annexures to the report are not yet available. Letter from Brigadier-General Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., C.B., to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated the 10 th July 1928. v I have the honour to refer to Colonial Office letter No. 59092128 of the 17th April 1928 (Serial No. 195 in F. No. 63-N.|28), relating to the nego tiations which I was appointed to conduct with His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies, and to submit my report on the progress and the results of my mission. 2. I left London on the 19th April accompanied by Flight Lieutenant G. M. Moore, M.C., and arrived in Alexandria on the 24th April. I was met by Mr. G. Antonius, C.B.E., Assistant Sec retary to the Palestine Government, and proceed ed on the same day to Cairo where I was met by Mr. B. H. Bourdillon, C.M.G., Counsellor to the Kesidency in Baghdad, Mr. K. Cornwallis, C.M.G., C.B.B., D.S.O., Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior in Iraq, and Captain J. B. Glubb, O.B.E., M.C., Administrative Inspector in the Iraq Government Service. 3. I spent two days in Cairo during which I had the advantage of conversation with Lord Lloyd, and also with Mr. Bourdillon who had been specially deputed by the High Commis sioner for Iraq to acquaint me more fully with his view on the subject-matter of the negotiations. Mr. Bourdillon left for Baghdad on the 26th April, and on the same day I left for Port Said with Captain Glubb and Flight Lieutenant Moore and embarked on the S. S. ' Chindwin ' for Port Sudan. Mr. Cornwallis and Mr. Antonius joined the u Chindwin ' at Suez, as did also Mr. A. Antippa of the Palestine Service, who had been lent as Stenographer to the Mission. 4. The Mission reached Port Sudan on the afternoon of the 30th April and sailed at noon on the following day on board H. M. S. *' Dahlia ' (Commander H. Cotton, R.N.), ^arriving at Jedda at 10 a.m . on the 2nd May. On '/arrival I was informed that the King had been delayed in Buraida and could not reach Jedda till the end of that week. His Majesty passed through Jedda on the 5th May on his way to Mecca where he had to pay the customary ritual visit, and returned to Jedda on the morning of the 7th. At 10-30 a.m . on that day, he re- iCeived me with the other members of the Mission in formal audience, and it was then arranged that negotiations should be opened on the follow? ing day. 5. Accordingly, the first meeting took place at &lt;8 a.m . on Tuesday the 8th May. Negotiations were formally opened at that meeting and conti nued with little intermission until Sunday the 20th May. Twelve meetings were held at which both His Majesty and myself were present, and a detailed summary of the conversations will be found in the' enclosed Record of Proceedings (Annexure* 1). Concurrently with my con versations with the King, Mr. Cornwallis held a series of meetings in committee with His Majesty's advisers (see enclosed memorandum and minutes, Annexure* 2) at which the subsi diary questions atfecting Iraq were discussed. As soon as these were over, a further series of meet ings were held by Mr. Antonius in committee with the King's advisers, at which questions affecting Transjordan were dealt with (see en closed memorandum, Annexure* 3). 6. The first question which came up for dis cussion was, naturally, that of the desert posts, and the incidents connected therewith. The King seized the earliest opportunity of defining his attitude; and from that attitude, as defined by him at our first meeting, he never receded. The deadlock to which our conversations carried us may be said virtually to have been reached at the end of the second meeting, when I had com municated to him the views of His Majesty's Government. My first task in this Report will be to set forth, as briefly as possible, the main points of the attitude taken up by the King, together with an outline of the course which I adopted to meet his arguments. 7. It will be remembered that the immediate cause of the present dispute was the construction by the Iraq Government of a post at Busaiya which is a w T ater-point in the desert, at a distance of some 75 miles from the Iraq-Najd frontier, and 55 miles from the nearest point in the neutral zone. On various grounds the King objected to the construction of that post, and in support of his objection invoked Article 3 of the first Protocol of Uqair, which reads as follows :— The two Governments mutually agree not to use the watering-places and wells situated in the vicinity of the border for any military purpose, such as building forts on them, and not to concentrate troops in their vicinity'. The Iraq Government, on the other hand, re jected Ibn Sa'ud's contention, and held that the above clause could not by any reasonable inter pretation be regarded as applying to Busaiya. 8. In order fully to appreciate the King's attitude on this point, it will be necessary to relate his version of the circumstances in which the first Protocol of Uqair was drawn up. This pro tocol was signed at Uqair on the 2nd December, 1922, as an appendix to the Muhammara Con vention of May, 1922, in which provision was made for the fixing of a frontier between Iraq and Najd. Ibn Sa'ud alleges that his delegates at Muhammara had signed the Convention in error; that he (Ibn Sa'ud) had steadfastly re fused to ratify it on the ground that a hard-and- fast frontier in mid-desert would be contrary to all the established usages of nomadic life ; that he had repeatedly pointed out at the time that such a frontier, with its inevitable corollaries in the form of posts and fortifications in the open desert, would be repugnant to his tribes; and that he had finally given his assent only when Sir Percy Cox had offered six months later at Uqair, to insert a clause containing such guaran tees as would meet his essential objections. Thus it was, according to Ibn Sa'ud, that Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair came into being. He maintains that it was only because of his firm belief that that article was intended to prevent the erection of posts anywhere in the open desert U3UFD *Not received.tm either side of the border, that he consented •to accept the frontier and ratify the Convention. 9. I took the line that His Majesty's Govern ment did not accept, and could not admit, his interpretation of Article 3 of the Uqair Protocol; that they regarded the distance of Busaiya from the frontier to be such that it could not reasonably be held to lie '' in the vicinity of the frontier''; and that they were bound to uphold the principle that the Iraq Government, as well as the Najd Government, were at liberty to take such ad ministrative measures within their own territory as seemed to them necessary for the better super vision of the desert. Throughout the conversa tions, I abstained from embarking too far upon a discussion of the merits or demerits of the posts at Busaiya and elsewhere. I preferred to take my stand on the unassailable ground of a fixed principle, namejy that, in the absence of any spe cific undertaking to the contrary, the sovereign right of each Government to take such internal measures as it thought necessary was one which His Majesty's Government were determined to uphold. 10. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that not only was Ib'n Sa'ud unwilling on grounds of general policy to give way on the question of the posts, but also that he was precluded from doing so by the attitude of his people. I used every means of persuasion and pressure at my disposal, and when these failed I decided to recommend, as an alternative to rupture, that the negotiations be suspended. The advent of the pilgrimage celebrations which were requiring the King's presence at Mecca for over a month made it necessary to bring our conversations to a close in any case. Ibn Sa'ud accepted my suggestion, and he also agreed to a formal exchange of letters (see Annexure* 4) in which a peaceful modus vivendi was laid down between Iraq and Najd for the duration of the period of suspension. He insisted, however, on one stipulation, namley, that in view of the fact that he had to return to Najd by the middle of August, and that he was pledged to communicate the result of his negotiations to his people on his return, our conversations would have to be resumed or definitely broken off by that date. 11. Before a decision can be reached as to whether or not conversations should be resumed, due consideration should be given to the three points put forward by Ibn Sa'ud as a basis for a settlement. The first relates to the posts them selves. To the last, Ibn Sa'ud maintained that the demolition of the posts at Busaiya Salman, and Shabaika, and the withdrawal of their gar risons were a sine qua non for the restoration of peace on the border. He argued that the habits and the mentality of the nomad tribes were such that the erection of a post at a water-point in the desert, even if built for peaceful purposes, was equivalent in their minds to a denial, or at any rate a serious restriction of access to the water He gave me to understand in the most friendly but explicit terms that, if the posts were maintained, he would have to decline all res ponsibility for the maintenance of peace. His tone was never offensive or minatory, but was consistently firm. He kept repeating that it was precisely the question Of desert fortifications which 'had dictated his refusal to ratify the Muhammara Convention, until Sir Percy Cox had offered him a guarantee against the construc tion of posts in the desert. Pie stated on more than one occasion that if doubt were cast on the validity of his interpretation of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair, he would beg His Majesty's Government to search among their records of what took place at the Conference of Uqair, in order to verify the accuracy of his contention. He declared that he, for his part, was prepared to offer his records for inspection. 12. The second relates to the incursions into Najd of cars and aeroplanes from Iraq. The King contended that the mere crossing of the frontier by forces from Iraq was a breach of hia sovereignty as recognised in the Treaty of Jedda, and a violation of Article 6 of the Bahra Agree ment [F. No. 149 (4)-N. of 1926].* He argued that the action of the cars and aeroplanes had so inflamed his people that even those whom he had detailed to punish the authors of the attack on Busaiya had turned on him and loudly demanded reprisals. It was then and only then that a movement began which led to the concentration of some 60,000 men from all tribes, even the most law-abiding, for .a retaliatory attack on Iraq, which only with the greatest trouble he had suc ceeded in preventing. He demanded an explicit assurance in writing from His Majesty's Gov ernment to the effect that Article 6 included Imperial as well as Iraqi forces. 13. The third relates to the question of ths- suri-ender of fugitives from justice. Ibn Sa'ud holds that discipline cannot be effectively en forced in the open desert so long as culprits are at liberty to cross the frontier and take refuge in an adjoining territory where his forces are pre cluded (by Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement) [F. No. 149 (4)-N. of 1926] from pursuing their. He had always felt, and now more than ever, that it was essential for the proper enforcement of dis cipline that the Governments of Iraq and Najd should mutually undertake to surrender fugitives from justice, and he pressed that an agreement to that effect should be the condition of any settlement. 14. I am unable to tell with any certainty to what extent Ibn Sa'ud's account of the origin of Article 3 tallies with the facts. His version of what had taken place at Uqair was detailed and circumstantial, and left me with the impression that he may have genuinely understood the pro visions of Article 3 to entail a wider application than is warranted by the facts. On the other hand it may be that his version is only in part correct, and that, being made wise by recent events on the frontier, he has amplified it in an endeavour to strengthen his case before His Majesty's Government and his position towards his own people. 15. On one point, however, Ibn Sa'ud appears to have some justification for his somewhat sweep ing interpretation of the phrase '' in the vicinity of the frontier '. In the Arabic text, the cor responding phrase is ala atraf al-hudud, and I am informed on reliable authority that this Arabic expression is capable of a wider applica- tion than its English counterpart. Ala atraf * *Not received. common froatier in the 0f Iraq and ma y not cross the t ©Senders except with the comment of both Governments imeans literally ' on tlie sides of or 'at the extremities of '' ; and 1 am creditably informed that, to the Arab reader who has no English, the phrase might and probably would convey a wider connotation than can reasonably be read into the English phrase. It should be noted, moreover, that no provision is made in the Muhammara Convention or in either of the two Protocols, for priority to be given to the English text, in cases of divergence between the English and the Arabic versions. , 16. My own conclusions are that, whatever justification Ibn Sa'ud may have for insisting on his interpretation of Article 3, it is nevertheless essential that the principle to which I have refer red in paragraph 9 above should be upheld. I am not convinced that the permanent security of the south-western confines of Iraq can best be ensured by a chain of far-flung posts in the open desert or that the task of defending Iraq will eventually be most easily and economically performed by the construction of a system of posts the mere presence of which is bound to give rise to effervescence in Najd. The fact cannot be overlooked that, even since the conclusion of the Bahra Agreement in November 1925 [F. No. 149 (4)-N.|26], there has been a remarkable absence of raids from Najd into Iraq, and that it was precisely the construction of the post at Busaiya that excited the Najd tribes to break the peace. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that on the princi ple of the sovereign right of the Iraq Govern ment to take whatever defensive measures it may think fit, no concession whatever should be made. 1 7 On the other hand, I am of opinion that it would be neither fair nor expedient to ignore altogether the arguments put forward by Ibn fea'ud or to underrate the difficulties of his posi- tl . on - -^ is account of the genesis of Article 3 ^ v. Protocol, of Uqair and of the meaning which it has always conveyed to his mind seems to me to bear the mark of genuineness. The loose rendering of the phrase ^ in the vicinity of the frontier for which there exist exact Arabic equivalents, has served only to lend justification to his reading of the clause in question. It is a matter for regret that no records are available other than those kept by Ibn Sa'ud, of the pro- ceedmgs of Uqair. In the absence of any such record and of any authoritative check on the accuracy or inaccuracy of Ibn Sa'ud's account, it would, -I submit, be unfair to reject it as al- together unacceptable. It would also be inex pedient, since it would be regarded by Ibn Sa'ud as an arbitrary dismissal of the case which he k W u ar n and which cannot 111 ^irness be said to be wholly unjustified. conld'SfX 6 tllerefore t0 recommend that due consideration be given to the possibility of reply ing tL n ^ 0n llneS Which ' while safeguard- ng the point o£ principle and upholding the sovereign rights of the Iraq Government might thl Tff SOme coneession of a nature to allay courf e Z eenee v Pr T iling in Na j d courage him m his efforts to keep the peace T tarl T 0Plm0n that ' as ™ have a duty to interests'of th 'j' ntalnin f? tic prestige and the country fn w Ruler and GOT ernment of that Wtherto 2 D TLT 14 t0 Ibn S^whohas treaties and a remarkable^ 10 ' 11 t reSpect for to his pledged wOTrf tfi termination to keep tie difficult situation with the maintenance of a fixed principle. If it- be found possible to offer him some concession, not on the principle of the right to construct posts but on the actual programme of their location and construction, then I believe that it would be in the best interests of all the parties concerned to aim at a settlement on those lines. 19. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the bare rejection of Ibn Sa'ud's representations might make it impossible for him to continue to- exercise a moderating influence on his tribes. Without accepting all his statements at their face value, I feel that, unless he is offered some tangi ble concession which might enable him to conti nue his efforts for peace on the border, there is a risk of the situation in Najd getting out of hand. I have no means by which I ean gauge with any accuracy the magnitude of this risk and , of its consequences but that it exists I do not doubt, any more than I doubt the adverse effect on Ibn Sa ud s himself of what might seem to him to be a wholesale rejection of his representa tions. 20. I have hitherto confined myself to those representations of Ibn Sa'ud which relate to Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair. There were two other points which he' put forward as being essential to any lasting settlement, and to which I have already referred in paragraphs 12 and 13 1 above. The first which relates to the definition of Article 6 of the Bahra Agreement [P. No. 149 (4)-N.i26]-, presents no difficulty. It Avas gene- rally understood, at the time of the conclusion of the Bahra Agreement [E. No, 149 (4)-N.|26J, that the term ' forces '' which occurs in Article 6 applied to all the regular forces of either Govern ment. Ibn Sa ud's request for an assurance that the term must be held, as far as Iraq is concerned, to include Imperial as well as Iraqi forces is there fore a proper one. But I venture to recommend since the question has arisen in this form that the opportunity be seized of obtaining a similar assurance on Ibn Sa'ud's part as to the precise meamng of the term when applied to the forces Tf + tt , o , ^ a matter of common knowledge that Ibn Sa ud does not maintain a regular standing army, and that he relies, for the pur- poses of military action, on the armed contin- gents of Ikhwan which his tribes are able from tune to time to supply. I think it advisable, in order to preclude the possibility of equivocation on his part m the future, to obtain from him an acceptable definition of what must be held to constitute the forces ' of Nejd, similar to that which he asks for from Iraq. ^ m u ? der ? tandln g on this point is the' t«k im wf m r w 0f the attitude Which 1 took up When replying to Ibn Sa'ud's protest against the violation of his frontier by aeroplanes and amoured cars. In this connection, I re- 0 t r COgl ' Se the affair at Busai y a ^ a raid F p No 149 ^47^261 'w ^ ■ dement l . imo.

The other point (see paragraph 13 above) relates to the, surrender of refugee offenders. This is not a new theme, and reference to my Report on the negotiations at Bahra will show that Ibn Sa'ud's request had been rejected in deference to the views of the Iraq Government. I have been given to understand, however, that the Iraq Government would be willing to recon sider their attitude on this matter. 23. The exchange of notes laying down the agreed terms of suspension of conversations was nearly prevented by an unfortunate development four days previous to my departure. Draft notes had been agreed upon in conversation and Ibn Sa'ud had left for Mecca, but before they could be officially exchanged I received an indig- jiajit letter from Ibn Sa'ud dated the 22nd May, supplemented by a verbal statement conveyed to me by his advisers, The gist of these communi cations was to the effect that Ibn Sa'ud had just received a detailed and circumstantial report informing him that on the 25th pr 26th April eight armoured cars had visited Aiwij and tried to persuade tribes to migrate into Iraq ; -hat a few days later three aeroplanes had flown over Lh}a and dropped bombs ; and that on or about the same date, other aeroplanes had flown over t;he Bashuk area. 24. Ibn Sa'ud's letter of the 22nd May is attached to this report (Annexure 7) but in his verbal protest, which was couched in much stronger terms, he stated that i—* а) he wished His Majesty's Government to enquire fully into the causes of the incursion which had taken place after peaceful conversations had been agreed upon and even after nay depar ture from London, and to fix the blame upon those responsible, б) he did not wish it thought that mere compensation would satisfy him, c) he reserved all his rights until a satis factory explanation had been fur-r nished, (d) he made this communication verbally, as he did not wish to embarrass me more than he could help. 25. It was obvious that Ibn Sa'ud was incensed to such a degree as to make it certain that, unless he received some satisfaction, he would refuse to sign the conditions of suspersion and thus involve a definite rupture. I therefore wrote to him on the same day (see my letter of the 22nd May, Annexure 7) * agreeing that any such inci dents as those of which he complained would be contrary to the spirit of our negotiations and promising to report the matter without delay with a view to obtaining explanations and further information. In the meantime, I telegraphed to the High Commissioner at Baghdad to request a statement of the facts. [See my telegram No. 69 of the 22nd May (S. No. 238 in F. No. 63-N.| 28), Annexure 7].* On the following day I received a reply from Sir Henry Dobbs from which it appeared that, although *no bombs had jbeen dropped and explanations of the o.ction taken were given in detail, the frontier had in fact been cpossed on the occasions mentioned. [See Sir H. Dobbs' telegram No. 925 of the 23rd May (S. No. 249 in F. No. 63-N.128) Annexure 7].* Ibn Sa'ud's main complaint to the effect that his frontier had been violated afresh, even after peaceful negotiations had been mutually agreed upon was thus shown to be based on fact ; and, in view of his extreme indignation and the critical nature of the situation thereby created, I was convinced that to put forward the High Commissioner's explanations and arguments at that moment would be worse than useless and would probably make a rupture inevitable. I therefore, added nothing further to my letter of the 23rd May, which at least had the result of easing tfhe situation sufficiently to secure Ibn Sa'ud's signature to the conditions of suspen sion (see my unnumbered telegram, An nexure 7).* 26. Ibn Sa'ud will doubtless raise the ques tion again when we resume conversations and I shall have to give him an answer. I suggest, in that event, furnishing him with the explana- tjons supplied by the High Commissioner of Iraq. These explanations, however, are not likely to satisfy him, and in all the circum stances I am of opinion that it would be proper, and most certainly politic, to accompany them by a suitably worded expression of regret. 27. During the course of our conversations I made it clear to Ibn Sa'ud that the Iraq Gov ernment would require to be compensated for ♦he lives and property destroyed in the attack on Busaiya Post, and would also expect that the loss of life and livestock occasioned to Iraq tribesmen by the subsequent raids should be made good in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Banra Agreement, [F. No. 149 (4)-N.|26]. His Majesty did not make any direct reply to this statement, and I did not think it advisable to pursue the question pend ing settlement of the main point of difference ; but his advisers made it quite clear that the Najd Government proposed to submit a heavy counter claim in respect of losses suffered by Najdi tribesmen during the course of the opera tions carried put by the Royal Air Force. 28. I shall now proceed to report on tthe pro gress made in the discussion of the subsidiary questions. In paragraphs 14 to 24 of your letter under reference, mention is made of seven questions affecting the relations of Ibn Sa'ud with His Majesty's Government. The first relates to Italy's new position in Arabia. On that subject I had a long conversation with the King, which is summarised in the Record of Proceedings (Annexure 2, minutes of 9th meeting) and more fully reported in the des patch which I shall have tjhe honour to address to you separately. 29. The second relates to the position of the Sharifian rulers of Iraq and Transjordan and their traditional hostility to Ibn Sa'ud. This ouestion which has long been a thorn in the lat-ter's side was frequently touched upon by him in our conversations. At the very first meet ing I had with him, he gave bitter expression tq his conviction that the scheming hand of King Faisal could be detected behind the present trouble, and that the dropping of warning notices and bombs had been cleverly prompted by the King of Iraq who was a past master in the art of alienating Arab tribes and under mining his (Ibn Sa'ud's) ascendancy over them. *Not received.I felt it necessary there and then to interrupt the King and give him a polite hint that, while I was always ready to lend a sympathetic ear 'to his grievances, I was not prepared to listen to aspersions oh King Faisal's character which seemed to me to exceed the bounds of legitimate criticism. I also gave him to understand, on more than one occasion, that the attitude and policy of His Majesty's Government towards himself were in no way influenced by the personal feelings of King Faisal and the Amir Abdullah. Whatever the effect of my words may have been, I failed to see any indication of a change in Ibn Sa'ud's attitude, or in his convictjion that the Hashimite brothers were at the bottom of all his tribulations with His Majesty's Govern ment. 30. The next four questions, namely tihose relating to— (i) the activities of Bolshevik agents in the Hejaz ; (ii) the Hejaz Railway ; (in) the abolition of Capitulations in the Hejaz ; (iv) the Haramain Waqfs, were not brought up by Ibn Sa'ud or by his advisers for discussion, and I abstained from taking the initiative of broaching them. From a perusal of the files at the British Agency, it was clear that Mr. Stonehewer-Bird had all the required information at; his disposal and was in a position to deal with the questions if and when they were raised by Ibn Sa'ud. 31. The seventh question, which formed the subject of paragraphs 20 to 24 of your letter under reference relates to the appointiment of an arbitrator to adjudicate upon past raids across the Najd-Transjordan frontier, and of a permanent Raids Officer to supervise the occur rence of future raids. This question was dis- .cussed at my seventh meetang with the King (see Annexure 2* minutes of seventh meeting). His Majesty informed me that he was still in favour of the appointment of a British arbitra tor, but that for various reasons he felt com pelled to insist on certain conditions prior to the appointment of the arbitrator. On my sugges tion, it was agreed that) the matter be fully dis cussed between his advisers and Mr. Antonius in committee. A series of committee meetings then took place of which the proceedings are summarised in the memorandum drawn up by Mr. Antonius (see Annexure 3).* 32. As will be seen from that memorandum, Ibn Sa^ud is now pressing for ttfie laying down of terms of reference designed to define the powers and duties of the arbitrator. His pro posals seem to me to be on the whole fair and acceptable, and in this view I am supported by Lord Plumer and the British Resident at Amman witfh whom I discussed the matter fully during my brief stay in Jerusalem. But there is one clause in the terms of reference which appears to me to be unacceptable namely clause 5 which purports to exclude from the purview of the arbitration all past claims which were not officially registered at'the time or soon after the occurrence of the raid. I am of opinion, and Lord Plumer concurs, that the adoption of this clause would mean that one of the two parties (in this case, Transjordan), is to be deprived of a fair hearing on grounds of the omission of a formality which was not specifi cally laid down in the Hadda Agreement, and which would amount to an improper restriction of the discretion of the Arbitrator who should alone decide whether a particular claim is worthy of being heard. 33. The King pressed insistently for the adoption of that clause, and his advisers in formed Mr. Antonius that, unless it were insert ed, he cculd not see his way to assent to the proposed arbitration. I refused to give way on that point, and in view of the King's insistence it was not possible to arrive at a final agree ment on the terms of the proposed arbitra tion. 34. I would recommend, as a possible way out of the difficulty, that I should be authorised to in form His Majesty that, although His Majesty's Government cannot admit a condition of that nature which they regard as unnecessary and improper, they are prepared to give him an assurance to the effect that his views on that point would be fully communicated to the arbi trator. I would also recommend that the agree ment to be arrived at prior to the appointment of the arbitrator should be recorded, not in a separate instrument as Ibn Sa'ud proposes, but in an exchange of notes. If this is approved, I should propose to address identical notes to the two Governments stating the conditions on which the arbitrator is to be appointed and ask ing each Government to inform me of its willingness to accept those conditions and abide by the terms of the adjudication. 35. The cognate question of the appointment of a permanent Raids Officer was discussed at the following meeting (see Annexure 2, minutes of 8th meeting). I explained to the King the reasons why it had not been found practicable to adopt his former proposal. He saw the force of my explanations and declared himself in favour of postponing the consideration of this question until the proposed arbitration had materialised and effected a liquidation of past raids. 36. In a second letter from you bearing the same number and date as your letter under reference, mention is made of two other questions. The first relates to the attack committed in Feb ruary last by Ruwala tribesmen led by Farhan ibn Mashur on certain sections of the Bani Sahkr tribes. In compliance with your instructions I informed Ibn Sa'ud that His Majesty's Gov ernment appreciated his attitude on that point and hoped that he would effect a settlement fully compensating the Bani Sahkr tribes for their losse^. Before I left Jedda, however, I received a verbal message from the King who was then at Mecca, to the effect that news had just been received of a series of raids committed by Transjordan tribes on tribes in the Wadi Sirhan who were subject to him. I was not in a posi tion to confirm or contradict the news, nor was I able when I visited Jerusalem ten days later to obtain any confirmation. I am given to understand, however, that news has since been received from Transjordan which tends to con firm the accuracy of Ibn Sa'ud's information. If that is so, perhaps you will think it fit to convey to Ibn Sa'ud an assurance that the Transjordan Government will take prompt and adequate measures to deal with the situation created by the raids on his tribes. *Not received.1 ,/ 37. The second question relates to the air- route along the south-western coast of the Persian Gulf (E'ile No. 117-N|28), and the supply of British pilots and mechanics to organise and operate Ibn Sa'ud's air service. On this question I made no attempt to approach Ibn Sa'ud. No settlement in regard to the main object of my mission having been arrived at, I did not judge it desirable to broach the ques tion, even tentatively. 38. In your letter No. 59092128, of the 18th (17th ?) April (Enclosure of Serial No. 195 in F. No. 63-N.|28) mention is made of a proposal put forward by the High Commissioner for Iraq, for a revised interpretation of Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement. This matter was dis cussed at Jedda and Ibn Sa'ud signified his agreement to the principle of the revised inter pretation as proposed by the High Commissioner for Iraq and concurred in by the High Com missioner for Transjordan. In view, however, of the deadlock on the main question, it was not possible to secure Ibn Sa'ud's final assent to this proposal. 39. On his side, the King put forward a pro posal for the conclusion of a Bon Voisinage Agreement, which was fully discussed between his advisers and the Iraq delegates. Similar discussions took place on the subject of the proposed Extradition Agreement, on the basis of the draft brought by Mr. Cornwallis and approved by the Council of Ministers in Bagh dad. The proceedings and the progress made with regard to both Agreements are fully reported in Annexure 2,* while the texts of the relevant drafts will be found in Annexures 5 and 6. I am of opinion that the conclusion of two such agreements would be a distinct step forward in the direction of improving the relations between Iraq and Najd. I would also recommend that efforts be made to obtain the assent of the Transjordan Government to the conclusion of two similar agreements between Transjordan and Najd. Lord Plumer with whom I discussed this matter in Jerusalem declared himself thoroughly in favour of my proposal. 40. In the absence, however, of an amicable settlement on the major question of the posts, I do not anticipate that Ibn Sa'ud would consent at this stage to the conclusion of either of the proposed Agreements. But this contingency need not deter the Iraq Government from draw ing up their own proposals in the light of Mr. Cornwallis's report to them ; so that, in the event of my Mission being sent out to resume negotiations with Ibn Sa'ud, I might find it possible to carry discussions a stage further towards finality. 41. One other question was brought up by Ibn Sa ud namely the appointment of accredited Najdi representatives in the mandated territories of Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan. His Majesty gave me to understand that he wajs dissatisfied with the growing number of conten tious disputes, mostly of a trivial nature, which arose between Najdi trading caravans and petty officials in Transjordan and Palestine. He also telt the need of a tactful and reliable person to represent him and defend his interests before the Governments of Iraq, Palestine and Trans- jordan. Another reason which had prompted this proposal on His Majesty's part was his dis satisfaction with the delays which often took place m the exchange of letters and messages. ''Not received. He proposed that a fully accredited representa tive should be appointed by him to Baghdad, and another to Jerusalem, The latter's credentials would cover both Palestine and Transjordan, 42. On this question, too, I am of. opinion that the adoption of Ibn Sa'ud's proposals would be a step in the right direction. I am informed by Mr. Antonius that the High Commissioner for Palestine is prepared to assent to the appointment of a Najdi representative in Jeru salem, It would be desirable that the views of the Iraq Government on this matter be ascer tained at an early opportunity. The appoint ment of a Najdi representative in Baghdad would entail the prior recognition by Iraq of Ibn Sa'ud as King of the Hejaz and of Najd and its Dependencies, and there is reason to believe that King Faisal would not. readily assent to the granting of such recognition. It cannot be denied, on the other hand, that the formal recognition of the de facto sovereign of an adjoining country with which Iraq is in friendly treaty relations cannot be indefinitely withheld without prejudice to good relations between the two countries, and it is a matter for consideration whether the present crisis does not afford a suitable opportunity to grant Ibn Sa'ud the recognition on which he not un naturally lays great stress. In this connection I would point out that Ibn Sa'ud's proposal for the conclusion of a Bon Voisinage Agreement will stand or fall according as the desired recognition is granted, or withheld, tvt 43 ' ^ tlie 20til the King proceeded to Mecca after a formal farewell meeting at the Mission House on the afternoon of that day. His principal advisers remained in Jedda where two or three meetings were held daily with ■ 0 ™ the 22nd Mr - Cornwallis and Captain Glubb sailed for Egypt where they' returned to Baghdad by air. On the 25th May' I sailed from Jedda on board H. M. S. Dahlia ' for Port Sudan, with Mr. Antonius and Flight Lieutenant Moore, and on the morning of our arrival in Port Sudan, I left ±or Cairo by the overland route. On the day of my arrival in Cairo (31st May) I proceeded to Jerusalem where I conferred with the High Commissioner and the British Resident, Amman, on the matters affecting Transjordan. Alter a stay of two days in Jerusalem, I pro ceeded with Mr. Antonius and Flight Lieutenant Moore to Porte Said where we embarked on the P. and O. S. S. ' Naldera . ^ cannot close this report without express- ^ r 6 8' ra ^ uc ^ e of myself and the members of the Mission to His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Najd and to the officials of his Gov ernment for their unvarying courtesy and con sideration. Our conversation were conducted throughout in an atmosphere of amity and mutual confidence, and everything possible was done for our comfort and convenience. Mr Stonehewer Bird and his staff gave us every heip and I should like especially to men tion Mr. Seagar and Mr. Thacker of the Consular staff, on whom the presence of the Mission threw considerable extra work. The presence of Mr. Cornwallis and Captain Glubb was of great assistance. Their know ledge of local conditions in Iraq was always at my disposal and I feel that it is of value for the future that they should* have had the oppor- tu o y , . makm g Personal acquaintance with Ibn Sa ud and his advisers.The course of the conversations was not such as to afford a favourable opportunity of discus sing questions immediately concerning the Air Ministry, so that Flight Lieutenant Moore's services were not utilised to the full At the same time, 1 found his knowledge and experience of desert conditions and tribal matters in Iraq of great value. I have to thank the Palestine Government for lending the services of Mr. A. Antippa as clerk to the Mission. He was both efficient and iude- tatig^able and performed his somewhat arduous duties to my entire satisfaction in conditions of some discomfort and inconvenience. I can only say of Mr. George Antonius that, as on previous missions of a similar character, his unique knowledge of Arab psychology his sound judgment and his unrivalled linguistic qualifications were placed unsparingly at my disposal. His services have been invaluable not only m the conduct of the conversations, both with Ibn Sa'ud and his advisers, but in the preparation of this report LC344FD—5—29-8-28—GI1P3 k %COHFIDKMTIAL, Office of the Political Hesiciem in the Peraian Gulf, Gamp, Bhira&amp;ft dated /O**- August 1928, No. of 1928.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to transmit to you, for the information of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, copy of a despatch to Sir G. Clayton, on the subject of the resumed negotiations with Ibn Saud. I am, &amp;c. S. H. WILSON. Enclosure in No. 1. Colonial Office to Sir G. Clayton. J- 2 F Sir, I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th July reporting on the progress and the results of your recent mission to Jeddah to negotiate a settlement of outstanding questions with His Majesty King Ibn Saud. The circumstances which led to the suspension of your conversations with King Ibn Saud last May as a result of a deadlock on the question of the advanced desert posts in Iraq, have been considered by His Majesty's Government in consulta tion with the Government of Iraq. It has been decided that the interrupted conversations should be resumed as soon as possible, and that the conduct of the resumed negotiations should be entrusted to you, a duty which it is understood that you are prepared to undertake. In communicating to you the instructions contained in this letter, in the isense of which the concurrence of the Iraq Government and, where necessary, that of the Government of Trans j or dan has been obtained, I am to explain that these are intended for your general guidance only, and that there is no desire on the part of His Majesty's Government to interfere with your discretion in regard to the precise form or manner in which the various decisions reached should be communicated to Ibn Saud. 2. In regard to the major question at issue, namely, lhat of the advanced posts in Iraq, you should inform King Ibn Saud that His Majesty's Government regret that they are unable to make any concession of principle. Subject to their treaty engage ments, which, in the considered opinion of His Majesty's Government, have in no way been infringed in the present case, the Iraq Government have every right to make what arrangements they please for the administration of their tribes and of their desert areas, and His Majesty's Government cannot accept any interference with this right, the maintenance of which they regard as essentially a British interest. You should, however, explain to King Ibn Saud that the actual system of administra tion to be adopted for this purpose has not yet been determined, and it is proposed immediately to consider a reorganisation of the present system. The present intention of the Iraq Government is to retain three advanced posts only, apart from such posts as may be required for the protection of the transdesert route and of a pipe-line, if and when constructed, and apart also from posts so remote from the frontier as clearly to be of no interest to King Ibn Saud. Into these two categories would fall the existing posts at Rutba, Ain Wiza and Muhaiwir, to none of which King Ibn Saud is understood to take exception. The advanced posts which the Iraq Government at present intend to retain will provisionally be located at Salman, Busaiyah and Shabicha, although the Iraq Government must reserve liberty to vary these locations if this is considered desirable hereafter. In the case of Shabicha, it is not proposed at present, unless the situation on the frontier becomes threatening, to proceed with the erection of permanent structures. 3. You should inform King Ibn Saud that you are authorised to communicate to him the assurance of His Majesty's Government and of the Iraq Government that [511 cc—1] Sf/di/zSrthese advanced posts are not designed for offensive purposes, and that Xejdi tribes will suffer no interference with customary rights of watering, grazing and peaceful movement at any of the points where advanced posts may be established. Those Governments realise that friendly co-operation with His Majesty is a necessary condition of the satisfactory administration of the tribal areas and the maintenance of peace in the desert, and to this end they would suggest for his serious consideration the appointment of frontier representatives on each side of the border who could confer together in the case of raids or other frontier incidents, and could apprise each other, as also their own Governments, of any happening likely to disturb the tribes and thus the peace of the border. Furthermore, in order that His Majesty may be in a position to satisfy himself that any advanced posts maintained by the Iraq Government are not used for offensive purposes, and that there is no interference with any Nejdi tribes in their legitimate pursuits, the Iraq Government would welcome periodical visits to the posts by his frontier representative. You should make it clear to His Majesty that the Iraq frontier representative would not necessarily be a British official. In regard to the question of the type of garrison ^ contemplated for the advanced posts, I am to enclose for your information and guidance copies of a telegram addressed to the High Commissioner for Iraq on the loth July, and of his reply. # 4. In the earlier paragraphs of your report you have recorded in some detail the views expressed by King Ibn Saud as to the meaning and intention of the disputed words m the vicinity of the border ' used in article 3 of the Uqair Protocol and you very rightly pointed out that, although His Majesty's interpretation of the words m question may find some support in the Arabic text of the article, that interpreta tion is one which had never been contemplated and cannot be accepted bv His Majesty s Government. Clearly the phrase stands in need of more precise definition and m order to remove the present ambiguity and thus eliminate the possibilitv of inrther dispute by the adoption of an agreed definition. His Majesty's Government would suggest that the phrase should be accepted as meaning within 25 miles of the rontier. In proposing this definition to King Ibn Saud you should make it clear that His Majesty s Government regard as excluded from the scope of article 3 of the Uqair Protocol any posts which may be required in connexion with the protection f f S r0 ^ te • and PPH 1116 ( if constructed), to which as an essentially British interest His Majesty is understood to have no objection in principle. of thp' i ^ q T^ ion r . a ! sed ln paragraph 12 of your report, namely, that ^• an Tk Q of article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, 1 am to authorise you to inform King Ibn Saud m writing that His Majesty's Government regard this article as applying to British as well as Iraqi forces. You may also assure His Mtide and a^} S lf a t 3 -l ty f S Gove ™ 1 ment intend to observe the stipulations of this V :! B ' tls ^ forces Wl11 not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders In the case, however, of an organised attack on a township or post—as AfliW a mf il e ra A d — or ln the ever, t of a series of raids with which His Majesty proves himself unable or unwilling to deal, His Majesty's Government mu=t reserve to themselves the right to take%uch action as J theV tS fiT wto communicating this assurance to King Ibn Saud you should, as suggested in paragraph 20 of your report take the opportunity of inviting Kmc Ibn Saud to explain the meaning which he attaches to the term 'forces'' in frtide 6 when V ^ f e l d His Majesty's Government agree that it is advisable. , er to preclude the possibility either of genuine misunderstandino&gt; or of brhZtocon^tute^' 1 ? the ^ aLptable definitton oFwhlt must oe neld to constitute the forces of Ne,]d should be obtained from King Ibn Saud. i ■' , ' y 0 '' . re P or t you refer to the displeasure evinced by King Ibn Saud on aftp? 1 1,? V aero P lane 3 s and armoured cars had crossed the Neid frontier after he himself had expressed his willingness to meet a repreJntatiVe Tllis to the Explanation oftb^ P^P 11 26 ) ^ ^ggest that when communicating mj Lne explanation o± the incidents m question furnished bv the Hio-h rnrnmicf 5 regret- As you are aware, one of the incidents of which King Mot printed.of a raid at so critical a moment was of such advantage to both parties as to justify the exceptional action taken. The other incidents related to the crossing of the common frontier by aeroplanes and armoured cars engaged upon reconnaissance duties. As you are now aware, on these occasions no bombs were dropped in Nejd territory. In view of the circumstances existing at the time, and of the justifiable uncertainty then felt as to the ability of King Ibn Saud to re-establish effective control over his tribes. His Majesty's Government consider that any relaxation of precautions at that time would have been unjustified and inconsistent with their responsibility for the defence of Iraq. In these circumstances they consider that the local authorities were justified in continuing reconnaissance across the Nejd frontier until they were satisfied that the meeting between King Ibn Saud and yourself would in fact take place, and that His Majesty would be si^ccessful in preventing the serious raid which was then threatened and re-establishing some measure of effective control over his recalcitrant tribes. His Majesty's Government therefore consider it desirable that the explanation conveyed to King Ibn Saud in regard to these incidents should not take the form of an admission that the action in question was unjustified. Such an admission would, in the circumstances set out above, in their opinion, be uncalled for, nor can it be overlooked in this connexion that an explanation so worded as to admit of being regarded as an admission of error on the part of His Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government would be likely to encourage a demand on the part of King Ibn Saud for the payment of damages. If, therefore. King Ibn Saud raises the question again on your return to the Hejaz, you should acquaint him with the true facts, as reported in Sir H. Dobbs's telegrams of the 23rd and the 26th May, and should explain to him that in the absence of the definite assurance from His Majesty for which His Majesty's Government had asked in regard to the prevention of further raids, and in view of the disquieting and conflicting reports which reached Iraq at the time of the conference at Buraidah, the continuance of active reconnaissance as a precautionary measure was considered to be necessary. You may add that His Majesty's Government would not, in view of the terms of article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, have sanctioned these measures but for the critical conditions which then obtained on the frontier. As already indicated in paragraph 5 of this letter, His Majesty's Government regard this article as applying to British as well as to Iraqi forces, and intend to observe its stipulations. The reconnaissances were in fact suspended immediately reassuring information as to the situation was received, and His Majesty's Government much regret that the action taken should have proved a cause of embarrassment to King Ibn Saud. 7. From paragraph 27 of your report it is observed that King Ibn Saud proposes to prefer a claim to compensation in respect of losses suffered by Nejdi tribesmen in the course of the operations carried out by the Royal Air Force. His Majesty's Government cannot regard any such claim as admissible, and you should do your utmost to resist a claim of this nature if presented, and to obtain full compensation for the Iraq Government both on account of the attack upon the post at Busaiyah and on account of subsequent raids upon Iraqi tribes. If, however, you are satisfied that there is no possibility of securing both compensation from Ibn Saud for the Busaiyah incident, and at the same time the withdrawal of his claim in respect of bombing operations in Nejd territory, and that insistence on this would have the effect of endangering a settlement, you are authorised in the last resort to acquiesce m an arrangement whereby the claim of the Iraq Government for compensation in respect of the attack on Busaiyah would be set off against King Ibn Sand's claim tor bombing operations, and these two claims would then be allowed to cancel out, while the remaining and financially more important Iraq claims in respect of subsequent raids would be referred to the special tribunal contemplated in article 2 of the Bahra Agreement. 8. In paragraphs 31 to 36 of your report you have recorded the results of your discussions with King Ibn Saud and of subsequent conferences at Jerusalem on questions arising out of past raids across the Nejd-Transjordan frontier. You are authorised to inform King Ibn Saud, as is proposed in paragraph 34 of your report, at, although His Majesty's Government cannot admit a condition such as that proposed m clause 5 of the draft terms of reference to the arbitrator who is to past raids, they are prepared to give him an assurance to the effect that the arbitrator will be fully informed of his view that all past claims which were not omcially registered at the time of the raid, or soon after, should be excluded from purview of the arbitrator. You are also authorised to adopt the procedureproposed in your report (paragraph 34) for obtaining the agreement, which will be a necessary preliminary to the. appointment of the arbitrator. You have been informed of the views of His Highness the Amir of Transjordan in regard to the draft terms of reference to the arbitrator, and it is understood that you will bear them in mind when framing the notes which you propose to address to the Hejaz and Transjordan Governments, setting out for their acceptance the conditions on which the arbitrator is to be appointed. As regards the proposal at the end of paragraph 36 of your report, you may assure King Ibn Saud that the Transjordan Government are taking prompt and adequate measures to deal with the situation created by recent raids carried out by Transjordan tribes on tribes who are subject to him. The High Commissioner for Transjordan has been requested to furnish you with full n particulars of the action already taken by the Transjordan Government in the matter. He has represented that it is important that King Ibn Saud should take similar action in regard to the attack made by the Rualla tribe on the Beni Sakhr tribe in February last. When communicating to His Majesty the proposed assurance on behalf of the - Transjordan Government you will no doubt obtain a similar undertaking from him jf and, if possible, a statement of the action already taken by him to deal with the I situation created by the raid of February last. 9. Subject to an acceptable arrangement in the matter of the advanced posts, His Majesty's Government trust that you will do your utmost to secure a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations for a hon voisinage agreement and an extradition agreement between Iraq and Nejd, which were in progress when your conversations with King Ibn Saud were temporarily suspended. In the interval, the Iraq Govern ment will doubtless have had an opportunity of considering the report of their own representative at Jeddah on the questions raised in those negotiations, and will now be in a position, where necessity exists, to put forward revised proposals. You are authorised to inform King Ibn Saud that His Majesty's Government I view with favour the proposal for the conclusion of similar agreements between Transjordan and Nejd, and are prepared to advise the Transjordan Government to enter into such agreements subject to the settlement in due course of satisfactory drafts. 10. In paragraphs 41 and 42 of your report you refer to the desire of King Ibn Saud to appoint accredited Nejdi representatives in Bagdad and Jerusalem. This proposal has been communicated to the Iraq Government, who have expressed their willingness, subject, of course, to an acceptable arrangement in the matter of the posts, to receive accredited representatives of King Ibn Saud and to accord to His Majesty the formal recognition of his regime in the Hejaz which the reception of his representative would entail. They would, moreover, desire to reciprocate the arrangement by appointing an accredited Iraqi representative in the Hejaz. It is not clear whether for the purposes of representation abroad King Ibn Saud regards the Hejaz and Nejd as separate kingdoms or as one State, and, consequently, whether he would wish to appoint to Iraq and to receive from King Feisal two accredited representatives or one. If the question of representation is raised in your conversa- i tions you should ascertain the wishes of King Ibn Saud in this matter, and also in which of his towns he would wish the accredited representative or representatives • of Iraq to reside, bearing in mind that the Iraq Government desire to be represented at Riyadh. r The similar proposal for the appointment of an accredited Nejdi representative at Jersualem, whose credentials would cover both Palestine and Transjordan, has ^ 1 been communicated to the Governments of those territories who have expressed their I willingness to accept such a representative, and the Transjordan Government, who have not hitherto done so, have agreed to accord to His Majesty formal recognition of his regime in the Hejaz provided that King Ibn Saud for his part will recognise the independent Government of Transjordan under the rule of His Highness the Amii, which formally will come into being on the ratification of the agreement 5 1 ? Britannic Majesty and His Highness the Amir, signed at Jerusalem on the 20th February, 1928. 11. A separate letter will be addressed to you in regard to the arrangements j J tor your return to the Hejaz, and in regard to the composition of your mission. I am, &amp;c. J. E.

Consul Stonehewer-Bird to Lord Cushendun.—{Received September 3.) (No. 126. Confidential.) My Lord, Jeddah, August 10, 1928. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith, with reference to my telegram No. 75 of yesterday's date, a translation of the official communique issued by the Hejaz-Nejd Government on the subject of the recent conversations between Ibn Saud and Sir Gilbert Clayton. 2. As foreseen in Sir Gilbert Clayton's telegram of the 9th August (my telegram No. 70), the tone of the communique is moderate and unprovocative. 3. I understand that Mr. Philby and Renter's agent yesterday telegraphed the text for insertion in the British press. The former, I gather, sent a long wire which probably contained much of his own comment. 4. (Confidential.) Tewfik-es-Suaidi, the Iraq delegate, had during the course of the negotiations long talks with Philby, and from the accounts of those present was most indiscreet. His utterances were duly communicated to the King by Philby, who informed His Majesty that he was drafting a telegram to his newspaper in England embodying the information so obtained. 5. The King* instructed Philby not to do so: the mission might thereby be embarrassed. Suaidi throughout his stay here was distressingly outspoken in all company, and those of my colleagues who met him were as amazed at his voluble indiscretion as they were attracted by his jovial personality. 6. I have addressed copies of the communique, enclosure in this despatch, to those posts to which the Jeddah monthly report is distributed. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIED. Enclosure in No. 1. Communique from the Press Department. (Translation.) NEGOTIATIONS have been resumed between His Majesty the King and his representatives on one part and the British Mission, headed by General Sir Gilbert Clayton, on the other, on the questions the completion of the former discussion of which was postponed until the end of the pilgrimage season. In spite of a sincere intention to reach a successful conclusion, the question of the demolition of the guard posts built by the Iraq Government and which the Nejd Government considers contrary to the third clause of the Uqair Protocol stood in the way of arriving at a result satisfactory to both parties. The difference in the points of view 'of the negotiating parties led to the negotiations being broken off without reaching a final solution. Notwithstanding the obstacles which prevented the success of the negotiations, His Majesty's Government will continue to deal with her neighbours as dictated by the spirit of concord and in accordance with the texts of the treaties they have concluded.

My dear Haworth, I am having an official reply sent to your letter No.291-S. of August 2nd. I cannot trace that any stores were sent to Kow^it and see no reason why they should have to©«n. The explanation why you were not consulted about Koweit was that we have held supplies of patrol there for some considerable time^and my staff did not think that the supplementing of these supplies would require your sanction. The petrol sent to Bahrein was sent in chat?ge of Mespers T Agent. I was away at the time, and I agree that in view of the somewhat delicate situation between us and Nejd it would have been better to send news of our intentions. It shall be dont? in future. 2. Trenchard is anxious to get on with the reconnaissance of the Persian Gulf by the seaplanes Wo now have at Basrah. So am I as soon as the weather gets is a bit cooler. If formal sanction is asked of the Home Authorities, it is unlikely to be given as so many have to be consulted and there is always a tendency to do nothing and play for safety. If the machines flew to KoiTeit and on to Bahrein keeping outside the three mile limit would you have any objection and can you agree 2 ' to this without reference elsewhere. The Honorable Lieut.

That suggestion did not, however, commend itself to His Majesty's Government at the time, but they have recently been considering, in case it should be necessary at any time in the future to threaten to impose such a blockade, what practical measures would in fact be necessary to ensure that such a blockade would be effective. Accordingly, I have the honour to request that you will, after consulting |X fy- o ♦ the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, furnish me by despatch with your considered views on the subject. 2. I do not desire you to assume that His Majesty's Government are seriously contemplating the imposition of such a blockade in the near future.

Yet the Senior liaval Officer would and does give his political facts and opinion® to the political authorities who give them due weight. But I can imagine no possible system by which the Resident was not, apart from technical matters, the final authority within his area. indeed I think it may be said that the existence of the Kavy in the Persian Gulf and certainly our subsidy for the rvrrian Gulf squadron has beftn due tCi. our political necessities. rhe divlsioii of labour is really easy and should,«hculd # as I huyc said, caune no friction.

Reference my telegram No.450-S of 10th September 1928. Up to the present no news of Ibn Sa'ud's arrival at Riyadh has reached Kuwait, and various theories are put for ward as to what will happen when he does. The general opinion seems to be that Ibn Sa'ud will try his utmost to maintain peace, but will fail to dO so,and that extensive raiding will take place again this winter - some even going so far as to think that he will be forced to Join in with the raiders. On the other hand, a few people are hopeful that peace never will be maintained, arguing that Ibn Sa'ud will^agree to participate in active hostilities against 'Iraq himself, and that the Mutair will not move this year unless he does, as they openly accuse him of being instrumental in getting them bombed in the spring. The possibility of the re-opening of trade with Kuwait is causing considerable interest both in Kuwait and outside, and many Bedouin - including some Mutair - are waiting to come in if Ibn Sa'ud's permission can be obtained.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 139 of the 27th ultimo, with which was enclosed a note addressed by me to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the alleged movement of troops in Iraq, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the reply addressed to me by Fuad Hamza. 2. I awaited Fuad Hamza's visit to Jeddah, when I hoped to have an opportunity of discussing certain points connected with his note before forwarding a translation. 3. Fuad Hamza called on me yesterday, and the question of the alleged move ment of troops was duly brought up for discussion. 4. I told him that I failed to understand the meaning of the latter part of paragraph 2 of his note, which reads: '' It is unfortunate that the reply to these comjSaints (against Iraq and British officials in Iraq) should emanate from those who were the cause of the complaints. What will be the state of affairs when the defendant himself replies to a charge? ' I said that every accused person was at liberty to answer a charge brought against him. That, Fuad replied, was not what he meant; what he objected to was that British officials in Iraq were in this case both 'juge et parti.' The charge was levelled equally against Iraq and British officials in Iraq, and the latter furnished the official repjy. I replied that the natural person to furnish an explanation was the High Commissioner in Iraq, who was the representative of His Britannic Majesty's Government. 5. Fuad Hamza then calls in question the reason given for the return of the troops to their posts in the desert. The desert, he maintains, is as hot in August and September as in June and July. I offered, on the occasion of our discussion, the explanation that, the heat being intense in June and July, it was thought wise to give the troops a change of climate, but this did not mean that they were not to return to their posts before the end of the period of great heat. 6. Fuad Hamza concludes by stating that the point on which he wishes to lay particular stress is that the Hejaz Government must hold Iraq responsible for the possible results of their action in moving troops unnecessarily and without giving due thought to the consequences. , 7. A copy of this despatch and its enclosure is being addressed to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. F. H. W. STONEHEWER-BIRD. Enclosure in No. 1. Fuad Hamza to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird. (After Compliments.) Jeddah, August 31, 1928 {Rabia I 16, 1347). I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 27th August, 1928, in which you reply to my letter regarding the statement of the Iraq Prime Minister and the despatch by the Iraq Government of forces and troops to the frontier. His Majesty the King complained of the action of the Iraq Government and of British officials in Iraq, and it is unfortunate that the reply to these complaints has emanated from those persons who were the cause of them. What will be the state when a defendant himself replies to a charge ? Similar incidents have now again been repeated. I have forwarded to your Excellency a protest against the despatch by the Iraq Government of armed troops to the frontier at a time when it is necessary for the sake of peace to avoid movement of troops, as such action would disturb the peace and cause excitement. [595 p—2]The Iraq Government sent through you the reply contained in your letter referred to above. I am unable to understand the statement of the Iraq Government that the severity of the heat during June and July was the cause of the withdrawal of the troops to cooler quarters, and that the diminished heat of August was the reason for their return. Is it meant that the heat in the desert during June and July is greater than in August and September ? The news now being spread from Bagdad mentions unusual activity in the despatch of military forces and the mustering of Government and private motor cars which leaves no doubt that the mobilisation includes persons other than those at the Shabaka post. Moreover, during the course of several conversations the members of the British and Iraq mission mentioned the decision of the Iraq Government to forgo the establishment of the Shabaka post. Their mobilisation in that post would confirm the fact mentioned by me in my previous protest to your Excellency. However, the important point to which I would wish to draw your Excellency's attention is not the fear of the mobilisation of military forces of the Iraq Govern ment, but that the Iraq Government and the officials who take such action without considering the consequences will be held responsible by my Government for whatever may occur.

IN continuation of my report, dated the 10th July, 1928, and with reference to your letter dated the 19th July, 1928, I have the honour to Submit a further report on my recent mission to the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies. 2. I left London on the 20th July, 1928, with Mr. G. Antonius, C.B.E., and arrived at Port Sudan on the 30th July, having been joined at Port Said by the Iraq Government delegation, consisting of Taufiq Bey Suwaidi, Minister of Education, and Major Bahauddin Muri of the Iraq army, accompanied by Ahmed Effendi Sarraf as secretary. Mr. E. C. Harvey, of the Palestine Civil Service, also joined the mission at Port Said, as confidential clerk and stenographer. 3. Leaving Port Sudan on the 29th July in H.M.S. ' Clematis ' (Commander F. Ratsey, R.N.), the mission, together with the Iraq delegation, arrived on the following day at Jeddah, where the usual official reception was accorded by the local authoritiets. 4. Ibn Saud arrived in Jeddah from Taif, travelling by way of Mecca, on the 1st August, on which day the mission and the Iraq delegation were received separately in formal audience. At this audience I handed to Ibn Saud, with due ceremony, a personal letter from His Majesty the King, which he received with marked gratification and an expression of deep respect and regard. It was then arranged to reopen conversations on the following morning. 5. Accordingly, the first meeting was held at 8-15 a.m . on Thursday, the 2nd August. Three meetings were held in quick succession; but on the following Saturday a sharp attack of fever incapacitated me and kept me in bed for four days. On the fifth day, namely, the 8th August, I was able to attend the fourth and last formal meeting with the King. A full record of the proceedings at those meetings, and of an interview which Mr. Antonius had with the King during my illness, will be found in Annexur^ l. # Concurrently with those meetings, a series of conferences were held by Mr. Antonius in committee with the King's advisers, of which an account is attached in Annexure 2. # The members of the Iraq delegation were granted one audience by the King, and held conferences with his advisers. I was kept fully informed by Taufiq Bey Suwaidi of the trend of thosb discussions, but I have had no written report from him. 6. On the eve of the opening of formal negotiations, Mr. Antonius had a long conversation with the King's advisers, from which it was evident that Ibn Saud had not receded from his attitude in regard to the interpretation of article 3 of the Uqair 4580 [18148] * Not printed. b2 Protocol and the cognate question of the advanced posts. I decided, therefore, that a decision must be reached on these two cardinal points before the Iraq delegation entered into the discussions. I also came to the conclusion, bearing in mind that direct methods appealed to Ibn Saud, that further discussion and negotiation would serve no useful purpose, and that the proper course was to lay the whole situation before him and to seek a decision of principle on the major point at issue. 7. I therefore informed Ibn Saud, in the course of our first two meetings, of the decisions which His Majesty's Government had reached in regard to the inter pretation of article 3 of the Uqair Protocol and the question of the posts, emphasising particularly the close attention which the matter had received in the highest quarters and the full consideration which had been given to his views and arguments, which I had conveyed faithfully and in full to His Majesty's Government. 8. I then explained fully the policy of the Iraq Government, and the assurance which they were prepared to give, in regard to the advanced posts, and dealt in general terms with the various other questions which I was empowered to discuss and negotiate, pointing out that His Majesty's Government and the Iraq Govern ment, though unable to give way on the main principle involved, were prepared to go to great lengths to meet the Hejaz and Nejd Government in various other questions to which Ibn Saud had always expressed himself as attaching great importance. 9. I concluded by urging the King to consider the situation as a whole, and to reflect deeply before deciding to maintain an attitude with which His Majesty's Government could never agree, and which would not only preclude a favourable settlement of such questions as extradition, hon voisinage, surrender of offending tribesmen and recognition of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd by Iraq and Trans- jordan, but might even endanger his relations with the British Empire. 10. Ibn Saud replied to this recapitulation of the main features of the situation by a very calm and friendly, but quite unequivocal, statement to the effect that he had given to the whole question careful and mature reflection and was unable to reconsider his attitude. He was convinced that his interpretation of article 3 was based on the spirit of the conversation at Uqair, in spite of anything Sir Percy Cox might now say, and he repeated that he would never have signed the protocol or ratified the Muhammara Convention if he had entertained any doubts on the matter, He deeply regretted to find that His Majesty's Government were now denying the principles on which, in his conviction, the Uqair Protocol had been based. 11. In any case, on the question of the advanced posts, he was now pledged to his people, who would never be content with mere assurances in a matter which they held to be one of life and death to them and in which he shared their views to the full. He was still inspired by unalterable feelings of friendship towards Great Britain and a determination to respect existing agreements; and he was convinced that a policy of co-operation with His Majesty's Government was in the best interests of his country; but in this particular question he was powerless to subscribe to the decision which His Majesty's Government had seen fit to take. 12. I am convinced that Ibn Saud was sincere in this expression of his views. From whatever angle I approached the question, he would put forward arguments which were clear, firm and unequivocal, and strictly consistent with his general attitude as he had defined it at the very outset of our negotiations. On one occasion, he confirmed his statements by one of the most solemn oaths which it is possible for a Moslem to take. I did not consider further argument either advisable or useful at the moment, so I begged the King to reflect once more before giving me his final decision and to accord me another interview on the following day. I 13. At our third meeting I made a further effort to induce the King to modify his attitude in regard to the major point at issue, in order to make it possible at least to discuss the other questions with which, hitherto, I had only dealt in general terms. He remained quite unmoved, however, by any arguments or inducements, and I realised that further attempts to shake him would not only be undignified, but might result in introducing an element of irritation and potty dispute into discussions which had been conducted, hitherto, on a calm and entirely friendly plane. 14. I, therefore^ informed the King that, to my deep regret, I saw no other course open to me than to terminate our conversations and to return to England. I added that I should report our failure to reach agreement to His Majesty's Govern ment, who would confirm their decision officially through the proper channel. In the meantime, and until the decision of His Majesty's Government reached him in final form, I considered that the terms of our suspension of conversations, agreed upon on the 24th May last, should be held to bind all parties. Ibn Saud signified: 3 his agreement to this arrangement, and I deem it vital that it be strictly observed by the Iraq Government and by His Majesty's forces in Iraq. 15. A sharp attack of fever incapacitated me for the next four days, during which Taufiq Bey Suwaidi had an interview with the King and discussions with his advisers. He was unable, however, to bring about any change in Ibn Sand's attitude, and I decided to fix the date of our departure for Thursday, the 9th August, lequesting the presence at Jeddah of H.M.S. ' Clematis' on that date. 16. During my indisposition the King paid me a personal visit for the purpose of asking after my health, and two days later Mr. Antonius had an interview with him in order to convey my thanks for his kindness and courtesy. During this visit Mr. Antonius had the opportunity of conversation on the questions under discussion, and I also had another interview on the 8th August, the day before our departure. 17. On both these occasions the King, while maintaining his attitude unchanged, gave clear evidence of his sincere desire to avoid any break of his relations with His Majesty's Government, and gave us the very definite impression that he meant to do his utmost to keep his tribesmen under control and to maintain peace on the frontier. I am of opinion that, while he has been somewhat shaken by the, to him, unexpected attitude of His Majesty's Government in the matter of the XJqair Protocol and by their decision in respect of the advanced posts, his long standing feelings of friendship towards Great Britain remain substantially unchanged, and that he will do his utmost to maintain friendly relations and observe the provisions of existing agreements. . . „ - j 18. He appears convinced that his obligations towards his people m Nejd render it impossible for him to give way, and it is probable that he hopes, by holding out firmly, to make it clear that he has supported them, thus strengthening his influence to an extent which will enable him to keep them in hand and prevent any serious outbreak. &gt; . . 19. If this is a correct appreciation, there is justifiable hope that the situation may resolve itself in the course of time, provided no untoward incidents on the frontier inflame it afresh. 20. I recommend, therefore, that the policy to be adopted be one of scrupulous observance of existing agreements, and that, above all, no violation of the Nejd frontier be permitted, unless a situation of such gravity should arise as to render abnormal measures unavoidable and entirely justifiable. There will almost certainly be unrest, and possibly a recrudescence of raiding across the frontier in the coming autumn and winter; but the line between raiding and deliberate hostile attack should be kept clearly defined. Constant vigilance and a carefully thought-out defensive organisation'will be essential, but I submit that the measures taken should be such as cannot be construed as violating the provisions of existing agreements; otherwise they will inevitably provoke the very danger which they are designed to meet, and may produce a situation which will commit the Iraq Government to indefinite embarrassment and expense. 21. To summarise the questions which I was instructed by the terms of your letter under reference to discuss with Ibn Sand :— {a.) The major issues of the interpretation of article 3 of the Uqair Protocol and of the advanced posts have been dealt with above. (b.) The proposed extradition and hon voisinage agreements were not discussed in detail with the Hejaz and Nejd Government, either by my mission or by the Iraq delegation, as our instructions laid down clearly that their negotiation and conclu sion were conditional upon an acceptable settlement in regard to the question of the posts. I was not reluctant to drop these agreements for the present, as, in view of the distrust and suspicion of the Iraq Government which exists in the minds of the King's advisers, and, indeed, of Ibn Sand himself, I feel that they would serve no useful purpose at this stage, and would probably only be used as a means of supporting future complaint against the Iraq Government of violation of treaty engagements. They are better reserved until such time as an atmosphere of greater friendliness and mutual confidence may prevail. {c.) For the same reason the questions of recognition of the Hejaz and Nejd Government by Iraq and Transjordan, and of the exchange of representatives, were not carried beyond a general intimation to Ibn Sand that they were susceptible of solutions favourable to him if a satisfactory settlement could be arrived at in regard to the posts. It was obviously undesirable to make for no return concessions which may be of use in the future. (d.) Ibn Sand did not again allude to his vehement protest against the violation [18148] B 24 of the Nejd frontier in late April last, at a time when friendly conversations had been agreed upon by all parties, though his advisers raised the question at one of their meetings with Mr. Antonius, who gave them a full explanation of the views of His Majesty's Government (see Annexure 2 # ). I did not, therefore, deem it either necessary or expedient to raise the question with the King. (e.) I did not consider that any good purpose would be served, in the circum- ! stances, by entering into what could only have been an acrimonious and unprofitable discussion on the subject of compensation. I therefore contented myself with informing the Hejaz and Nejd Government that the Iraq Government must reserve their right to claim compensation for the destruction of life and property at Busaiya, and would also, in due course, submit a claim (under the provisions of the Bahra Agreement) in respect of lives lost and property looted in the course of the raids subsequent to the attack on that post. (/.) It was also quite obvious that the time had not come in which it was possible to put forward the proposal for the appointment of frontier representatives with any prospect of securing its acceptance. An arrangement of this nature will require to be evolved gradually, and is contingent upon a return to normal conditions on the frontier. {g.) The question of raids on the Nejd-Transjordan border was discussed by Mr. Antonius, on my behalf, with the King's advisers, who were fully informed of the measures taken by the Transjordan Government for the punishment of the perpetrators and the restoration of loot (see Annexure 2 # ). The Hejaz and Nejd Government were also asked to furnish, on their side, similar information to the Transjordan Government, which they promised to do on receipt of detailed information which they were expecting to receive in the immediate future. (h.) With regard to article 6 of the Bahra Agreement, I informed the King at our first meeting of the interpretation placed upon that article by His Majesty's Government. The matter was subsequently raised by the King's advisers in committee with Mr. Antonius, who informed them that His Majesty's Government^ while fully prepared to give a formal assurance to the effect that article 6 would be held to apply to Imperial forces in Iraq, were of opinion that it was also desirable that some clear definition of the term 'forces,' as applying to Nejd, should be simultaneously agreed upon. The King's advisers did not question the fairness of this proposal, but no further reference to this matter was made either by the King or by them. {i) The question relating to the proposed arbitration on past raids between Nejd and Transjordan was exhaustively discussed, first in committee between Mr. Antonius and the King's advisers, and subsequently with the King himself at my fourth and last meeting with him. Ibn Saud admitted openly thafhis insistence on the retention of clause 5 in the proposed terms of arbitration'was dictated by Lis fear lest the large and (as he thinks) 1 unjustified claims submitted by the Trans- jordan Government to the Jericho Tribunal might mislead the arbitrator into an unfair verdict. I pointed out to him that there was every reasonable guarantee that that would not be the case, and I parted from him on the understanding that he would await the receipt of a formal proposal from His Majesty's Government. I attach the draft of a note (see Annexure 3*) which I suggest should be addressed in identical terms to the Nejd and the Transjordan Governments, in which I have -embodied all the conditions agreed upon by both Governments and inserted an assurance which, while it safeguards the right of the Transjordan Government to a fair hearing, might overcome Ibn Baud's objections, in that it ensures that his views on unregistered or belated claims will be fully brought to the notice of the arbitrator. 22. I seized the opportunity to discuss with Ibn Saud the question of means of communication for official correspondence. The King stated that he realised that the delays which were occasioned were due in part to the absence of quick means of communication in Nejcl and in part to the frequency of his movements between the Hejaz and Nejd. With a view to remedying this disability as far as possible, he had recently elaborated an organisation for the speedy transmission by motor car of messages from Jeddah to Riad. He wished, therefore, to request that in future all messages and communications from the mandated territories be sent to him through Jeddah, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. He pointed out that, during Ms absences in Nejd, his Foreign Affairs advisers and staff remained at Mecca or * Not printed. l5 Jeddah; and he had taken the necessary measures to enable them to forward all communications to him by the quickest possible route. 23. During the course of my visit I took a suitable occasion to present to the King an astronomical telescope and a sporting rifle, on behalf of His Majesty's Government. He was evidently much pleased and interested in these presents and asked me to convey his warm thanks to His Majesty's Government. 24. At 10-30 a.m . on the 9th August the mission paid an official visit of farewell to the King. The interview was merely for the purpose of taking my leave. Ibn Saud was most friendly and cordial, and once more assured me of his sincere desire for the maintenance of good relations and close co-operation with His Majesty's Government. 25. At the close of the interview Ibn Saud handed me a personal letter for delivery to His Majesty the King. as^ 26. The mission embarked, with the usual ceremony, in H.M.S. ' Clematis ' % at 11-30 a.m . on the 9th August and arrived at Port Sudan on the following day, rill|. sailing for England in the Bibby steamship ' Cheshire ' on the 12th August and ( ojsj , reaching London on the 21st August, 1928. 27. The Iraq delegation and Mr. E. C. Harvey left Jeddah on the 10th August by Khedivial mail steamer ' Taif ' for Suez. I cannot close this report without recording my thanks to Taufiq Bey Suwaidi for his assistance and cordial co-operation. It is unfortunate that the Iraq delegation were unable, in the circum stances, to achieve any definite results, but I feel that their mission was not entirely fruitless and may pave the way to a greater measure of co-operation and sympathy between the two Governments in the future. 28. At my last formal meeting with him, the King made a statement concerning Mr. H. F. Stonehewer-Bird, His Britannic Majesty's agent and consul at Jeddah, to which I venture to draw your attention (see Annexure l. # Proceedings of Fourth Meeting). The tribute paid to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird, coming as it does from a sovereign who is not lavish in his expressions of praise, seems to me to be one on which Mr. Stonehewer-Bird deserves to be warmly congratulated.

It is an artificial creation ©f Bin Saud intended t© divert trade fr®m Kuweit. If the liejd trade Q-f Kuweit revived th^t ©f Juhail w®uld sink int® insign*- -ificance. \ The three perts are mainly served through Bahrein, though each may have a small direct trade with Persia and with ©ther Arab ports. Juhail's trade with Kuweit prehably eciuals that which it carries on with Bahrain• This is due t® the settlement in the pert ®f several Kuweiti merchants, wh© turn for supplies t® their mether tovm rather than the mere preximate^alirain. The proportion of the sea borne trade ©f the ±kw. other tv/o ports which dees not pass through Bahrain must he very small.i \ articles ef and c It thing. The tetal imperts ©f the three parts frem all ssurces sheuld approximate Rs 50,00^000• should 4 # A blockade of these ports/at first have a considem - -able effect on the Bedouins living in the eastern districts of Nsjd, who would find their supplies of rice and cloth cut off * The effect would however bo considerably mitigated if, as I believe, ther£are reserves in st^re ©n the mainland. Bahrain itself is overstocked with rice and prices are very lev/. If the Hsa blockade were long continued I anti- -cipate that tuvifjtt, and even Iraq merchants, would see an opportunity for enriching themselves that they could not resist* In addition to Dubai and Abu Dhabi about which I have no details, Bohah and Wakrah under Q,atar v/ould derive considerable benefit at the expense of Bahrain. 5 # The takings of the Dohah Customs House at 5 ^ ad valorem, amount to about Rs 1,20,000 annually. The total v^lue of goods imported should therefore be 24,00,000. The other small ports of Qatar would bring the total to Rs 25,00,000. As the Qatar peninsula contains a very small population a considerable quantity of these imports must find wht way to Hasa and the border tribes such as the aht . jyiURRAE, who now obey bin ^2. Jilawi. I ©m informed that a monthly caravan leaves Behah for Hofuf. I have as yet been able to get no estimate of the ©-mount and nature of the goods imported into Hasa by this route. Whatever the quantity may be, a very considerable increase may be expected if the direct route,via the Hasa ports^v/ere cut off. In order effectively to blockade Hasa it would be necessary therefore to include supervision over Qatar^and probably over Dubai and Abu Dhabi^in the organisation. The merchandise from Dubai would probably go to Abu Dhabi by dlio^ owing t® the difficulties and length of the land route 6 # The blockade would deal a very severe blow at the— f the main trade ©f Bahrain, which, ezcluding pearls, is in rice and piece goods* This trade is still very largely in the hands ef Sindhi Eanniahs, wh© would thus 'be the chief sufferers financially# The ©rder ©f exclusien ©f Hindus frem Qatif, which appears t© he imperfectly enferced, as I saw twe Banniahs in qatif during my recent visit, has favoured the Arab and especially the ^ejdi merchant at the expense of the Hindus', hut the main portion of the impert ©f rice and piece goods into Q,atif and Uqair still passes through their hands• The trade between Bahrain andJ Juhail seems to be largely in the hands ©f Abdul Aziz Qusaibi and Comapny, wh© are Bin Saud's agents in Bahrain. 7, The Bahrainis b©th Sunni and Shiah, wh© depend ©n the pearl fisheries for theit livelihood would not be very badly hit by the blockade, but it might have the effect ©f driving out the Banniahs* These men have n© permanent stake in the islands» If they saw their trade sulfering they might move en blec^! to Dubai in the hope of carrying ©n ©peratisns from there, as Shaikh Abdullah will net admit them t© Qatar. If ©nee established in Dubai, many ©f them might prefer t© remain there rather than make a sec©nd m©ve. Their presence might divert t© Dubai a p©rti©n ©f the trade now coming to Bahrain and thus give a fillip to a tendency, already discernible, of the Qatar ports to receive their goods via Dubai instead ©f by the Bahrain reut© # i estimate that the bleckade ef the Hasa psrts w©uld bring an immediate loss ©f Customs revenue ameunt- -ing t© rupees two lakhs ©ut of an annual income of rupees ten lakhs accruing te the Bahrain State from this source. If ©ne effect ©f the blockade were t© be the diversion of trade, to however small an extent, t© other ports the injury done to the State would be permanent. This in itself would antagonise the ruling family, who are dependent ©n the State revenues for their livelihood. The large Ski ah population whese interests arc mainlyjl mainly confined t© pearling and date growing and wii® have n© reason t9 'be grateful fer Wahabi rule, ewing t© itis treat- -ment ef their ce-religienists in Hasa and ftatif, weuld prehalDly 'be passive♦ The^ might even welceme bad relations between Bahrain and Hejd* Their Sunni cenfrcres, although suffering little ecanemically v/©uld be drawn tewards Hejd 'ly the religieus tic» Yusuf Kanoo an influential man among them, v;®uld be an actual sufferer from the blockade. 10* Bin Saud, although disliked by many and feared by more, is the one big Arab of Arabia, As such, when opposed t© foreigners, he makes a strong call on the national and religious feelings of the Gulf Arab. The blockade would there- ~fore be extremely unpopular, more especially if, as I suppose it must, it were based on Bahrain* In G^atar of which the ruler is a professed Wahabi, there can be n© doubt what- -ever of the anti-British feeling that would be aroused. The Shaikh informed the Pslitical Resident in April 1927, in a meeting at which I was present that he could take no actien that might displease the Akhwan, My secret reports show that, even now, there is an anti-British feeling in the country. The blockade would at once cause the British to replace the Persians as the chief enemy of the Arabs. Shaikh Hamad the Deputy Ruler of Bahrain has a profound admiration for Bin Saud* He shows the most intense desire to comply with any request from him or his -Amir in Hasa. He favours O.usaibi, Bin Saud's agent, above all merchants in Bahrain* &lt;_To take action against Bin Saud trould be intensively distasteful to him. At the same time he would accept any ' advice ' that His Majesty's Government might offer to him. His heart, however, would not be in his deeds, and the value of his own co-operation, and that of his subjects, would thereby be adversely affected. All would know that Shaikh Hamad had been forced t® adopt a cQuA4it® which he was opposed^ and his position as a puppet ruler, which it is British policy to conceal would be laid bare to the criticisms of the PersiansPtrsians and the w»rld. 11# When passing through Bushire at tli® 'beginning of Octeber, the Senier Naval Officer speke t® me ©n the subject •f the 'best means ef carrying ©ut the blockade. I understoed from him that the Nav^ favours the use of Bahrain launches for their operations. These craft sere country 'built 'but fitted with Kelvin engine. There are at preseiit on the Bahrain register 11 launches for passenger traffic 'between TAwASN/VC-i Manama and Muharraq # 5 private launches, 7 used for trunolaip- i # e. for visiting the pearling fleets, and 6 employed on cargo work.

His first letter contained the same old demands as last year, already several times reported, namely: (1) Abolition of telegraphs and ears. (2) Abolition of taxation of bedouins# (3) Bemoval of desert posts# To these demands, Ibn Sa'ud, according to Ibn Mallaf, replied as follows; (1) That modern inventions were of assistance to the iuelimin in maJting head againet the modern GoyenV'.ente surrounded them# (2) Ibn Sa^d agreed to abolition of taxes, but pointed out that he would of course have to cease to make present# and to pay th# Shaikh# at the same tim#. (3) Regarding■WH X -2- (3) Regarding the desert poete, he replied that he had not the power to destroy them. He further eald that, before the Duwiaii etarted raiding 1 Iraq regularly, the British Government had 'been of great value to the luelimin, giving them weapon® and money, much of whieh hae been paesed on by Ibn Ba'ud to the Shaikhs. The Buwieh'e acte had firnt caueed the Govern- jaent to cut off hie pay, and had then forced Govemraent to eend forces and to build poets in the deeert. The Buwieh hiapelf wa® therefore reeponaible for the existence of the posts. As long as the latter maintained his old attitude, Ibn Ba'ud could not demand the destruction of the posts, and had not done so yet. But if the Duwish repented, openly made submisBion and signed an undertaking to be obedient in future, Ibn Sa'ud might then approach the Government on the subject of the oosts at the forthcoming conference at Unair. Ibn Ba'ud explained that he had no liking for infidels or Chriatians nor for the British, but that their friendship was of value to the Muslimin, and that his policy was to ret as much out of them as he could for the benefit of the true Muslims. The Government and he had long worked on a policy of give and take, but the l:uwish had upset the whole situation. If he persisted, Government would become more angry still, and could easily overthrow himself (Ibn Sa^d) and the Duwish, and ruin the Muslimin, ^ho after all were only bedus. If, on the other hand, the Duwish wanted to destroy the posts himself, he could do so. Perhaps he would defeat the Government. If so, Ibn Sa'ud wished him joy, but he would not himself have afcy part or lot in the matter* (Bote. The above is probably the gist of Ibn Sa'ud 1 s replies to the Buwish, and of his public pronouncements.) As the correspondence continued, Xbn Sa'ud became firmer.r.'' -5- fimsr t and thd Duwiah begani**climb down^, tSrentually the latter sent his ceal to Riyadh, telling Ibn Sa 1 ud to affix it to any documentn he liked, that he,Faisal, would obey all hie orders, but th%t ha could not come to Riyadh because he wae afraid. It is generally conjectured that, if Ibn Sa^d could seize the person of Faisal, he would detain him in his suite personally # much as he has done with Ibn Hashid On receiTing the Duwish 1 s last submissive letter, accompanied by the seal, (Ibn Hallaf alleges) Ibn Sa^d turned his attention from the Duwish to Ibn Humaid. He had written to him that, if ha did not coxae to Hiyadh, he had better tidy up his mudhif and prepare dinner for Ibn Sa'ud. It is stated that Ibn Huiuaid replied that he could not come, and that he had no mudhif in which to receive ibn Sa'ud. Ibn Hallaf thought that Ibn Sa'ud was probably pretending to be temporarily satisfied with the Duwish's letter in order to turn his attention to Ibn iiumaid. The great object was to separate them. It was believed that Ibn Humaid was already angered with the Duwish, for sub mitting so fan ♦ IShaidan Ibn Hithlain has also refused to ragpartito Hiyadh, but nobody seems to be attaching, isuch importance to him either way. Having sworn a joint oath with the Buwish and Ibn Humaid before, he is deterred from visiting Ibn Sa'ud for fear of punishment, rather than from Insubordination. 2, Vi'TITL'THi! 0? 'fHI! AKHWAJt. Th« AdsinistratlTe In.psctor aaic.d Ibn father it was hi. opinion that, should th. Duwish and Ibn Hunaid persist in their refusal to weet Ibn Sa'ud, the latter would march against them. Me replied that he thought© -4- thought thi« T«ry unlikely. In hi» view, rbn Sa f ud had no forces to put againet thera except the townsmen of Kafd, who were not sufficiently numerous. Had ibn Sa^d unfurled his banner last January, Harb Shanmar, Awazim, ^.ahtan and many other tribes would have joined h&amp;m against . utair and Ibn nuraaid. In fact they were daily expecting such an order. Instead of this, however, Ibn Sa'ud did nothing, ^nd the Duwish proceeded to r^id Ibn ^a'ud's own tribes, ibn numaid then moved up, and camped at \jibba, on top of ^ahsin al ?im, whom he terrorized into agreement with him, although M Firm had, until then, been looked up as Ibn Sa^ud^ especial man« finally at buraidah, Ibn Sa'ud had poured out gold and gifts to the very people who had been disobeying his orders and raiding his subjects. There had, however, been no compensation for the vietims« 4s a result, nobody would now declare openly for Ibn Ba'ud against the ^uwish or ibn Humaid, lest they be raided by them. Ibn Hallaf said that he found that, when he broached the subject cautiously to Hajd Shaikhs in Riyadh, they hastily said W we follow the road of Islam', and changed the subject. Mahsin al firm, when summoned to Hiyadh six we^ks ago* was afraid to proceed, lest the Buwish be annoyed and raid him, with Ibn Sa»ud impassive far away in Riyadh. Mahsin is one of the principal Akhwan chiefs, and was previously a firm supporter of ibn Ba 1 ud• iiut he was afraid to visit Riyadh, until ASaiyis al l^awish went. In Ibn Hallaf 1 s opinion, Ibn Sa'ud is not the men he was. 4s he put it the -ing only wants to finish his days in peace, ^nd would leeve the Vfchwan to their own devices if he could, even though the stripped the abba off hishis b^eic. But he cannot laave affair# to run their course, as h« ie preened hy the GoTernment on the one hand and by the Akhwan on the other. The Duwish and ihn Htunaid are not opposed to 'Iraq or the deeert poets, hut are ohafing against Ibn Sa'ud's authority. Meanwhile Ibn Sa'ud, hy his procrastination and weakness, has, in Ibn Haliaf's view, missed his chance of armed support hy the Vkhwan trihes against the insubordinate chiefs. Woording to Ihn Hallaf, the majority of the ?, 1th wan in Riyadh are p re s 9 ing Ibn Sa'ud to leave the Duwish und Ibn Humaid alone, '^e, they say, will promise to obey all your orders. If these two try and create trouble again, we shall not loin them. But they are only two men, leave them alone, what is the use of pressing them further?'. In brief, the malcontents do not desire to fight Ibn Sa'ud, and are prepared to make their submission by letter, and to promise to keep quiet. But they still refuse to appear in person. Ibn Sa'ud has so far apparently scored a succeas, in that the malcontents have greatly moderated their tone, and the Duwish has sent a submissive letter and his seal. But it is doubtful if Ibn Ba'ud will have the power to force the affair to a final issue, because, in Ibn Hallaf's opinion, the tribes would not now join ibn Sa'ud in arms against the malcontents. 5, VISITORS TO uv The Bhafir relate wonderful tales of the entertain ment of bedouins in Riyadh. Estimates of the numbers present vary from 12.000 to 16.000, though both are probably exaggerated. the bedouins were all accommodated in tents outside the towm The townsmen, and contingents from other town- . wmr* rec«iv*sd within the walU Burridah, 'ynaixah etc. , were 1 ElyRiyadh, were issued with rifles and ammunition, and were posted to guard the walls. The gates were closed at dusk, and the town contingents held the walls until dawn, which they greeted by firing a fett-de-joitf in the air, apparently to show that they were awakeo Ibn Sa'ud was apparently in some apprehension of a coup de main by the bedouins# Owing to the great number of guests, the lesser men and many of the numerous escorts, were presented with gifts and clothing, and dismissed as soon as possible, presumably to avoid continued expense on hospitality. Ibn Hallaf left before the end with some of these people. The principal Shaikhs, including Ajami ibn Suwait, and all heads of Akhwan colonies, are still detained in Riyadh, Ibn Sa'ud having ordered them to remain until his correspondence with Ibn Humaid and the Buwish reaches a definite conclusion* Iln Hallaf alleges that the Ilhafir Shaikhs received generous gifts from Ibn Sa^d, considerably in excess of those given to the Hajd Shammar for example. On the other hand, he think that Ibn Sa^d told \Jami that it was not expedient for him to build an ikhwan village. 4# iwzmtiom - dhajxh ih bajb. The Administrative Inspector then enquired of Ibn Hallaf what were the intentions of the Phafir. He replied that, as far as he was concerned, he would much prefer to remain in * Iraq. In Hajd, the Bhafir were, as it were, clients, strangers allowed to remain on sufference. The Akhwan knew that fear had compelled the l)hafir to Join than, and they treated them accordingly, Except for the person of Ibn Sa'ud himself, who received them cordially and loaded them with presents, they had no friends in Hajdo UnfortunatelyUnfortun^taly, Governmant adopted th« aairievpolicy of procrustInatIon, promises md inaction, a,« did Ibn Sa'ud. The latter nit inactive in hie palace at Riyadh, while hie friende were being raided, with the reeult that nobody would now openly declare for him. In the same way, the Government sat on the Juphratee or in Baerah, and ordered the 'Iraq tribes to be loyal. But they had seen no Covernment forces, and the subjects of the Government had been raided with the same Impunity as had the friends of Ibn Sa'ud. Nobody could quite understand why both Ibn Ba'urt and the Government, who either single or united were invincible if they would only act. allowed the Duwish to work havoc right and left amongst their friends. The fact remained, however, that while the Government and Ibn Sa'ud talked and messed about, the Duwish was the only man who acted. 4s a result, nobody now ventured to declare openly either for Ibn Sa'ud or the Government. If the latter were to bring down sufficient forces to the vicinity of the frontier, he for one would join the Government. But as long as Government remained in the posts or on the river, he hoped that the \dministrativs Inspector would excuse him if he recrossed the frontier and camped with Vutal*. Miis was a statement of his own policy, lie could not answer for the Suwait family. &lt;^0 much for Ibn Hallaf. The present it'ea of the Shafir in Kald appears to be to keep in, as far as possible, with both Covernment and Ibn Sa'ud. and to camp with -utair. Ibn Sa'ud is a useful friend gives away large sums of money, and may of course ewerge victorious over - utair. as regards the Government, the lhafir depend, on 'Iraq for supplies, and may also need to camp in 'Iraq.

Ibn \8hwan and Co. are therefore not too sure what their reception would be, even in irtawiyah* They therefore, according to the Dhafir, hope to remain in the vicinity of the frontier, in the Hafar - fieutral Area Batin district. 4« regards their crossing into «Iraq, they do not appear to have done so with the idea of seeking asylum with the 'Iraq Government. Having, however, spent the summer in the Neutral Area without interference, even after \bu Manaiyah»s raid on the Dahamshah, and having seen no sign of Government forces, they do not appear to consider the attitude of the Government to be a factor of any importance in the situation. It la quite probable that they will shortly drift back across the frontier of their own accord.

He wishes therefore that Gluhh should be directed to sand meaeengers iinmediataly to the *utair to ask why they have come in without permission of the 'Iraq GoTemment and whether they have had the permission of Ibn Sa'ud.

I AM directed by Lord Cushendun to inform you that Sir Gilbert Clayton has now reported to His Britannic Majesty's Government on his recent mission to the Hejaz. His Britannic Majesty s Government have learnt with regret that he has L been unable to reach any agreement with King Ibn Sand on the major question at i issue, namely, that of the advanced police posts in the southern desert of Iraq. In consequence, it was not possible further to discuss the various subsidiary questions in regard to which it was desired that he should negotiate arrangements with King Ibn Baud. 2. You will recall that in September of last year King Ibn Saud addressed to the High Commissioner for Iraq a protest against the establishment by the Iraq Government of certain advanced police posts. The post to which His Majesty took principal exception was one at Busaiyah, then in course of construction, which provided accommodation for some fifteen police. The post was situated at a distance of 75 miles from the nearest point on the Iraq-Nejd frontier. In his letter His Majesty represented that the construction of this post was contrary to the provisions of article 3 of the Uqair Protocol of the 2nd December, 1922, which reads as follows :•— The two Governments mutually agree not to use the watering places and wells situated in the vicinity of the border for any military purpose, such as building forts on them, and not to concentrate troops in their vicinity.' Some three weeks later King Ibn Saud followed up this letter with a further protest. At this point it should be explained that the construction of the Busaiyah post and similar police posts was undertaken by the Iraq Government originally in response to a previous complaint by King Ibn Saud that the measures taken by the Iraq Government to put a stop to tribal raids into Nejd territory had proved ineffective. The Iraq Government hoped by the establishment of these advanced police posts to facilitate the administration of the tribal areas and to obtain early information which would enable them to deal more effectively with raids across the frontier from either side. 3. In the latter part of October the High Commissioner replied through His Majesty's Agent to King Ibn Saud, pointing out that there was no foundation for the charge that the establishment of the Busaiyah post was a contravention of the Uqair Protocol, and sending photographs and details of the post to demonstrate that, quite apart from the fact that it could not be described as 'in the vicinity of the border,' its small size and limited garrison rendered any description of it as a fort' misleading. On the 5th November, while this correspondence was in progress, f a party of Mutair attacked the Busaiyah post and slaughtered its occupants, ! ■- including, in addition to the garrison of six police, an official of the Public Works Department, twelve coolies and a woman. After this attack there followed in quick succession a number of serious raids by Mutair tribesmen upon Iraq tribes. Strongly- worded protests were sent to King Ibn Saud, hut these produced unsatisfactory replies which, while admitting that in carrying out these raids the leader of the Mutair, Sheikh Faisal-al-Dawish, had. acted in defiance of His Majesty's instruc tions, represented that the fault really lay with the Iraq Government m constructing the police post, and that if the post were abandoned the raids would cease. It seemed clear that the Mutair tribe had temporarily thrown off King Ibn Saud's authority and were no longer under his effective control, and this view was apparently sub stantiated by a warning which His Majesty conveyed to the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the effect that a large force of Akhwan were marching north contrary to his orders. In these circumstances, His Britannic Majesty s Government decided that there could no longer beany objection to the. Royal Air Force in Iraq being authorised to pursue Akhwan raiders across the border in order to inflict, if possible, a lasting [623 a—1] Blesson upon them. This decision was communicated to King Ibn Saud and was put into effect without delay. 4. In the meantime these constant Akhwan raids had had the effect of seriously unsettling the Iraq tribe of Anizah, one of the most powerful tribal confederations in Iraq. Towards the end of December the High Commissioner reported that, unless effective measures were taken to prevent further raids and to restore the confidence of this tribe, there was a serious danger that they would throw off their allegiance to Iraq. He explained that, owing to the immense stretch of frontier, and the great distance involved, it was almost impossible for British aircraft to catch the raiders red-handed and to inflict punishment upon them within Iraq territory. After full consideration. His Britannic Majesty's Government decided to extend air action beyond the Iraq frontier in order to deny an area of grazing grounds to the Akhwan. Early in January, and after the lapse of some two months since the initial incursion had taken place, during which further raids had occurred and King Ibn Saud had apparently taken no effective measures to restrain his recalcitrant subjects, the authority for the adoption of this measure was given and King Ibn Saud was notified accordingly. Advance aircraft and armoured-car bases were pushed forward to the vicinity of the frontier and notices were dropped warning tribes to move out of the area which was to be denied to the Akhwan. This action, coupled with constant air reconnaissances, was sufficient to restore the confidence of the Iraqi tribes, and for some three weeks the raiding activities on the part of the Mutair were suspended. At the end of January, however, further raids occurred, culminating in a raid upon Iraq and Koweit tribesmen by some 2,000 of the Akhwan who penetrated to a depth of some 65 miles. The raiders were attacked by British aircraft, and are understood to have suffered severe losses. 5. As you are aware King Ibn Saud had hitherto endeavoured to justify himself and his tribes by the contention that the Iraq Government had broken their treaty pledges, and thus to excuse his failure to prevent the raids and to administer punishment. He now represented that the crossing of his frontier by British aero planes was a violation of his territory. These aeroplanes, he alleged, by bombing guilty and innocent alike, had so outraged the feelings of his people that he had had to abandon measures which he had already set in motion for the control and punishment of the Mutair, his work of pacification had been destroyed and he could no longer control the feelings of his people. In regard to this allegation, the High Commissioner for Iraq telegraphed on the 19th March in the following terms ' It is important to emphasise and to keep on emphasising that no human beings have been bombed other than those pursued hot-foot after the raids in Koweit territory of the 27th January and at Jarishan in Iraq on the 19th February. A few bombs were dropped in the neighbourhood of encampments in the zone of operations within Nejd territory during the period the 18th January to the 2nd February, in order to frighten them into obeying the warnings already scattered. Only four or five camels were killed. No human beings were hit.' 6. In response to the King's message. His Britannic Majesty's Government replied that, in order to assist him to regain control and provided that His Majesty would give assurances that he would prevent further raids and would punish the offenders and exact full reparation, orders would be issued that no aircraft should cross the Nejd frontier except in hot pursuit of raiders. At the same time, His Britannic Majesty's Government repeated a suggestion previously made by them on several occasions that a meeting should be arranged between His Majesty and the British Resident in the Persian Gulf to discuss the questions in dispute. His Majesty did not accept this invitation, nor did he give the assurances for which His Britannic Majesty's Government had asked, but merely reiterated his previous protests. Meanwhile, rumours became current that all the Akhwan were joining with the Mutair in a regular jihad (holy war) against the non-Akhwan States of Iraq, Transjordan and Koweit, and that King Ibn Saud (himself powerless to prevent it) had been forced to associate himself with this movement. Later infor mation, however, threw doubt upon these rumours, and indicated that King Ibn Saud had dissociated himself from the movement. Subsequently it became apparent that he had regained control. 7. Throughout his letters King Ibn Saud maintained that the establishment of the Busaiyah post or any similar police posts was a contravention of the Uqair Protocol, and he continued to press for its abolition as providing the only solution of the present trouble.3 His Britannic Majesty's Government, for.their part, were not prepared to admit that the Iraq Government, m constructing such posts, acted otherwise than in full accom with their treaty obligations; nor were they prepared to agree to the demolition of posts. It seemed to them, however, that a full and frank discussion of the question m dispute might go far to convince King Ibn Saud that his protests against the establishment of the Busaiyah post were unjustified, and that in this matter the action of the Iraq Government had been entirely correct. To this end it was decided that Sir Gilbert Clayton should proceed to Jeddah to enter into personal discussion with King Ibn Saud and to furnish him with such explanations and assurances as, it was hoped, would set at rest any genuine doubts which he might feel both as to the intentions of the Iraq Government in constructing j such posts and as to the use to which it was proposed that they should be put. 8. The main point at issue now resolved itself into a difference of interpreta tion of the words ' in the vicinity of the border ' (Arabic : ' ala atraf al hudud ') jf in article 3 of the Uqair Protocol. It appeared that King Ibn Saud had read into these words far more than they were intended to convey by His Britannic Majesty's Government. In his view, the object of the article was to prevent the erection of fortified posts at any of the wells situated in the open desert on either side of the frontier and at any distance from the frontier, and he contended that had not this been the intention he would have refused to ratify the Convention of Mohammerah, to which the Protocol of Uqair was appended. Unfortunately, no detailed record of the conversation leading up to the signature of this protocol exists. But Sir Percy Cox, the British Plenipotentiary, who represented the interests both of His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government, at their discussions, has categorically affirmed that, on his part at least, the words in dispute were not intended to bear any strained or exceptional construction or to convey any meaning other than that which would ordinarily be assigned to them, namely, a short distance on either side of the frontier. While, therefore, it seemed clear that these words would not admit of the interpretation placed upon them by King Ibn Saud, events had shown that they were, in fact, open to misunderstanding. Consequently it appeared to His Britannic Majesty's Government highly desirable in the interests of both parties that some means should be found of removing any element of ambiguity and eliminating the possibility of further dispute by the adoption of an accepted definition. Sir Gilbert Clayton was therefore authorised to suggest to King Ibn Saud that they should be defined as meaning within some specified distance from the frontier, and for this purpose a maximum distance of 25 miles was suggested as a basis for discussion. Alternatively, it was suggested that instead of a definition based upon distance from the frontier, certain wells on each side of the frontier should be specifically enumerated at which the construction of posts would be prohibited. 9. These suggestions were conveyed to King Ibn Saud on the occasion of Sir Gilbert Clayton's first visit to Jeddah in May last. He was, however, as you will remember, unable to convince His Majesty that in constructing the advanced desert posts the Iraq Government had not contravened their treaty obligations; nor could any progress be made towards arriving at an agreed interpretation of the disputed words in article 3 of the protocol. The advent of the pilgrimage season, which required the King's presence at Mecca for over a month, made it necessary i to bring the conversations to a close in any case, and it was decided that Sir Gilbert Clayton should take this opportunity to return to England and report personally to His Britannic Majesty's Government. 10. On the receipt of Sir Gilbert Clayton's report, and on learning of the attitude taken up by King Ibn Saud in the matter of the Uqair Protocol and the advanced posts, the whole question was re-examined by His Majesty s Government in consultation with the Iraq Government. After the fullest consideration, His Majesty's Government decided that in this matter they were unable to make any concession of principle. They held that, subject to existing treaty engagements which, in their considered opinion, were in no way infringed in the present case, the Iraq Government had every right to make what arrangements they deemed necessary for the administration of their tribes and of their desert areas, and that any attempt to interfere with this right must be resisted. Sir Gilbert Clayton was therefore instructed on his return to Jeddah to inform King Ibn Saud accordingly, but at the same time, to make it clear that the permanent system of administration to be adopted for this purpose had not yet been determined, and that it was proposed inimediately to consider a reorganisation of the present system. Sir Gilbert Clayton [623 a—1] B 2was also authorised to inform King Ibn Sand that it was the present intention of the Iraq Government to retain three advanced posts only apart from such posts as might be required for the protection of the trans-desert route and of a pipe-line, if and when constructed, and apart also from posts so remote from the frontier as clearly to be of no interest to His Majesty. 11. Sir Gilbert Clayton was, furthermore, instructed to repeat to King [bn Sand the assurance of His Britannic Majesty's Government and of the Iraq Govern ment that these advanced posts were not designed for offensive purposes, and that Nejdi tribes would suffer no interference with customary rights of watering, grazing and peaceful movement at any of the points where advanced posts might be established. He was to add that the two Governments realised that friendly co-operation with His Majesty was a necessary condition of the satisfactory administration of the tribal areas and the maintenance of peace in the desert, and that to this end they again suggested, for his serious consideration, the appointment of frontier representatives on each side of the border who could confer together in the case of raids or other frontier incidents, and could apprise each other, as also their own Governments, of any occurrence likely to disturb the tribes and thus the peace of the border. He was further to state that in order that King Ibn Saud might be in a position to satisfy himself that any advanced post maintained by the Iraq Government was not being used for offensive purposes, and that there was no interference with any Nejdi tribes in their legitimate pursuits, the Iraq Govern ment would welcome periodical visits to these posts by his frontier representative. Sir Gilbert Clayton was also instructed to endeavour once more to persuade His Majesty to adopt the proposal put forward in May that the disputed words 'in the vicinity of the border ' used in article 3 of the Uqair Protocol should be accepted as meaning within 25 miles of the frontier, except in the vicinity of the trans-desert route and contemplated pipe-line, in which region, it was understood. His Majesty felt no objection in principle to the construction of protective posts. In addition. Sir Gilbert Clayton was authorised to inform His Majesty that, subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached in the matter of the advanced posts, the Iraq Government were prepared to conclude arrangements with King Ibn Saud in regard to hon voisinage, extradition, the surrender of tribal offenders, the exchange of diplomatic representatives, &amp;c., on the lines discussed with his Majesty's advisers on the occasion of Sir Gilbert Clayton's earlier mission, and in terms which were understood to be acceptable to His Majesty. 12. During the conversations of May, King Ibn Saud had enquired whether His Majesty's Government regarded the provisions of article 6 of the Bahra Agree ment, which stipulates that ' the forces of Iraq and Nejd may not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders except with the consent of both Governments,' as applying to British as well as Iraqi forces. Sir Gilbert Clayton was instructed to assure His Majesty that His Britannic Majesty's Government fully intended to observe the stipulations of this article, and that British forces would not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders. In the case, however, of an organised attack on a township or post—as opposed to a mere tribal raid—or in the event of a series of raids with which His Majesty had proved himself unable or unwilling to deal, His Britannic Majesty's Government must reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they thought fit. Sir Gilbert Clayton was directed, when com municating this assurance to King Ibn Saud, to invite His Majesty to explain the meaning which he himself attached to the term '' forces '' in article 6 when applied to the forces of Nejd. It was felt desirable that, in order to avoid the possibility either of genuine misunderstanding or of equivocation, an acceptable definition of what must be held to constitute the ' forces ' of Nejd should be obtained from King Ibn Saud, since it was understood that for military operations he had hitherto relied almost exclusively upon tribal elements of the nature of those which had recently carried out a number of raids against Iraq. 13. As you know, Sir Gilbert Clayton returned to Jeddah to conclude his interrupted conversations with King Ibn Saud at the end of July, and he at once communicated to His Majesty the decision of His Britannic Majesty's Government in the matter of the advanced posts and the various assurances and explanations set out in the preceding paragraphs of this despatch. In doing so, he emphasised the close attention which the matter had received, and the full consideration which had been given to His Majesty's views and arguments, and explained that, although unable to give way on the main principle involved, His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment and the Iraq Government were prepared to go to great lengths to meet the Government of the Hejaz and Nejd in various other questions to which His MajestyIf) m i had always expressed himself as attaching high importance. For example, the Iraq Government had expressed their willingness to waive their objections to the extradi tion of political offenders—a point which the Hejaz and Nejd Government had pressed for some time past. King Ibn Saud replied that, after having given the matter careful and mature reflection, he was unable to reconsider his attitude in regard to the advanced posts. He represented that on this question he was now pledged to his people, who would never be content with mere assurances in a matter which they held to be vital, and in which he personally shared their views to the full. Although still inspired by unalterable feelings of friendship towards Great Britain, and convinced that a policy of co-operation and amity with His Britannic Majesty's Government was in the best interests of his country, the question of the posts was one in which he was powerless to subscribe to the decision which His Majesty's Govern ment had seen fit to make. Subsequent conversations failed to move King Ibn Saud from this attitude; although his demeanour throughout the resumed conversations was markedly friendly, and even conciliatory, on the main point of principle he was entirely immovable. Consequently, as further argument would have been both useless and undignified. Sir Gilbert Clayton had no alternative but to inform the King that, in the circumstances, there was no course open to him but to terminate the conversa tions, return to England and report the failure to reach an agreement to His Britannic Majesty's Government. 14. It now remains only for His Britannic Majesty's Government to confirm through the official channel their decision in the matter of the Uqair Protocol and the advanced desert posts. You should accordingly communicate to King Ibn Saud the note of which the English text, with Arabic translation, is enclosed herein. I am, &amp;c. MONTE AGLE. C Enclosure in No. 1. Draft of 'proposed Note to King Ihn Saud. Tour Majesty, November 1928 . I HAVE the honour to inform your Majesty that I have been instructed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of His Britannic Majesty s Govern ment, to address the following communication to your Majesty. ^ p • ji 2. His Britannic Majesty's Government, while fully appreciating the friendly spirit in which the recent conversations between your Majesty and Sir Gilbert Clayton were held, have, learnt with deep regret that those conversations have not resulted in any agreement on the major question at issue, namely, the interpretation of article 3 of the First Protocol of Uqair. „ , , 3. His Britannic Majesty's Government have given the most careful and sympathetic consideration to the views and arguments put forward by your Majesty, and they are particularly anxious to do everything in their power to assist your Majesty in your manifest efforts to maintain peaceful conditions on the frontier But, on the other hand, they cannot but regard it as a matter of fixed principle that the Government of every country is entitled, in the absence of specific undertakings to the contrary, to carry out such measures of internal administratis territory as it may from time to time think necessary. e m ? , • your Majesty seeks to place upon article 3 of the First Protocol JL . which, in the opinion of His Britannic Majesty's Government and ^ of Iraq, is not onlv inconsistent with the text of the article, but would involve an unwarrantable departure to the detriment of Iraq, from the a^ove-mentioned principle. It is S these reasons that your Majesty's 4. In the conversations which he was privileged to ha ^ e y lth ^ j Lj£ Sir Gilbert Clayton emphasised certamposts in the had caused the Iraq Government to construct ana mdmuij m ,.*1 desert.

'i'l ■ ■ ^ ■ m 16 5. In earnest of their desire to arrive at a fair and peaceful settlement of the question at issue, and to remove all obstacles in the way of consolidating the relations of amity and concord between the two Arab States, His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment and the Iraq Government are prepared, should your Majesty so desire, to submit the points in dispute to an arbitrator to be selected in consultation with your Majesty and in agreement between the Governments concerned. I am authorised formally to offer to your Majesty this proposal of arbitration and to invite your Majesty to inform me whether you are prepared to assent in principle to a settlement on that basis, so that the mode and conditions of the proposed arbitration may be discussed without delay. 6. His Britannic Majesty's Government desire to repeat the assurance given to your Majesty by Sir Gilbert Clayton, to the effect that they regard the provisions of article 6 of the Bahra Agreement as applying to British as well as to Iraqi forces, and that they fully intend to observe the stipulations of that article, provided,- of course, that your Majesty's subjects abstain from hostile acts of aggression of a nature and on a scale likely to endanger the security of Iraq. 7. His Britannic Majesty's Government hope that their proposal of a settlement by arbitration will commend itself to your Majesty, not only for the sake of settling in a manner which is fair and honourable to all parties the points of dispute, but also because such a settlement would pave the way to the conclusion of formal agreements on the various questions affecting Nejd, Iraq and Transjordan, which were discussed and agreed upon in principle by your Majesty and Sir Gilbert Clayton. Those questions relate to agreements on hon voisinage, extradition, the surrender of fugitives from justice, the appointment of diplomatic representatives and cognate questions. 8. If, on the other hand, your Majesty should not agree to seek a settlement on this basis and would prefer, rather than have recourse to arbitration, to leave the question unsettled, with-tlie resultant risk of unrest on the frontier. His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government could only regret such a decision on the part of your Majesty. 9. In that case the Governments concerned must agree for the time being to postpone any settlement as to the true meaning of article 3 of the First Protocol of Uqair. Nevertheless, the various treaties and agreements regulating the relations between the Governments concerned remain in full force and effect; and it is the firm intention of His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government scrupulously to observe the obligations imposed by those instruments, and to direct their energies to the prevention of any incidents of a nature to provoke disturbances on the frontier or to disturb the friendly relations of the two countries. They are confident that your Majesty will discharge your obligations with the same scrupulous regard, and they note with satisfaction your Majesty's assurance to Sir Gilbert Clayton that the Government of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies intends strictly to observe the terms of all treaties and agreements in its relations with the neighbouring States.Telegram P, From H.K. the High CommiBsinner for Iraq, Baghdad.

On the morning of December 29th aeroplanes with Glubb found body of iuO raiders at Thulaimah close to frontier about fourteen miles north of Jumaimah. Irac^ shepherd tribes who had encamped at this place up to December 28th and evidently been first ob jective of raiders, having received warning from Glubb had fled during night* Raiders on seeing aeroplanes opened fire • on them and were bombed with result that 12 camels and 3 men were left on the ground and remainder of raiders fled south across border.
