The papers include correspondence from Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited; Petroleum Concessions Limited; the Political Agent, Bahrain (Cornelius James Pelly); the office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and the Government of India. The papers also include discussion of the question of whether the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 could be applied if, as seemed likely, Alberts had fled to Goa, March 1948; and a copy of the warrant for Alberts's arrest, signed by Pelly, 6 April 1948.Note that the 'D' in Alberts's name in the file title appears to be an error.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003b8#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003b8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
