Dear Neal, »/ould you kindly see the enclosure. The 'two sons' of the Shaikh were, I imagine, Shaikhs Kalifah and Salman bin Mohammed. They told me casually in the course of conversation that they were going to go 'Amarah for shooting and I asked them to give my salams to Berkeley who was Consul there 1 ut has apparently now left. So far as I remember I gave them nothing in writing. Have you any knowledge of the matter at the Agency and did any Agency i officer give them a letter of recommendation? Yours ever, (SGD). W.R. KaY. C.J. Felly, Esq., OBE. , Political Agent, Bahrain.RESTRICTED. BRITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 24th November, 1949. (Si-2/19/49) Dear Sir Rupert, We had a slight contretemps here a few days ago over the'arrival at Basrah of two sons of the Shaikh of Bahrain who came enroute for a shooting trip at umara, bringing with them cars and guns and a consider able retinue which included, among others, the Bahrain Commandant of Police. The party apparently arrived without warning, and had not, so far as is known, been invited by anyone in Iraq. Their only travel document, so we are told, was a letter of recommendation from yourself. The Ministry of Interior were invoked and got on to us about the visit. We could only say that we had no prior knowledge of it, tut naturally hoped that full facilities would be accorded. These were in fact given on orders from the Prime Minister without any further intervention on our part and t e Shaikh's two sons have now gone on their way to Amara. It would have been of considerable help to us, and also to Davis at Basrah, if we could have had some warning of the visit, and I hope that in the event of any further visits of this kind taking place we can be notified in advance so that we may inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Yours ever, (SGD). H. TREVELYAN. 5 * ^ } Kis Excellency * Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I. ., C.S.I., Political Resident in t v e Persian Gulf, HaH-iAIN.riiii&amp;TnlCTED ^o. I 5/7 /s-c Dear Agency, British Consulate-General, Basra, November 23 rd, 1949. In the course of conversation with the Mutasarrif of Basra yesterday the Consul-General learned with some astonishment that two sons of the Shaikh of Bahrain_(their names were given as SaLmM and MUHAMMAD AL KHALIFAE) had recently arrived at Basra by one of the British India boats, without visas for Iraq and without any prior nbtice to the Iraq Government or the local authorities here, with their own cars, sporting guns, and twenty servants ('•slaves*' was the word His Excellency used), for the purpose of doing a little shooting in Southern Iraq. The Consul-General had to tell the Mutasarrif with some chagrin that he too was not in possession of any information regarding this visit. Do you think you could manage to let us know in advance of any future visits of this sort? In this particular instance no particular harm has been done as our i&amp;utasarrif, who is exception ally co-operative, immediately arranged with the local authorities to afford the distinguished visitors all possible facilities. The two visitors were thus allowed to land at Basra without passport formalities and were authorised to import their cars, guns etc. without any of the special permits that are normally required. They have now gone off to Amara. It was obvious however that the mutasarrif*s sense of hospitality was outraged by the fact that owing to lack of notice he had not been able to arrange for the Shaikh's sons to be suitably welcomed at the Port when their ship docked and that nothing had been 'laid on' for their entertainment accommodation here or for their trip to ^nara. We are sending a copy of this letter to .bagdad Embassy for their information. Yours ever, Consulate-GeneraJL The Political Agency, CAdHAlb .Confidential. Political Agency, PERSONAL Bahrain, 14th December, 1949 \ Dear Sir Rupert I return herewith your personal letter and its ^ enclosure about the visit of Shaikhs Khalifah and Salja^n bin Mohammed to Iraq. I also enclose for yourJkiformation a copy of a letter received by me from Davis on the subject and also a copy of my draft reply to him. It v/ould be better if you approved of it before issue as you will pre sumably be replying to Trevelyan and we ought both to tell the same story. Shaikh Khalifsh came to me before they left and asked me for the ordinary letter 'To whom it may concern' requesting their ^ood offices and I gave it to him. I as sumed he had made his own arrangements for visas and for completing other formalities ad his father always does when undertaking similar journeys or, if he had not done so, that he was able to dispense with them as his uncle does when he visits Saudi Arabia. these two young men did not themselves carry enough weight either to be able to (or perhaps to have enough sense to) make private arrangements with the Iraq Government people to facilitate their journey: nor are they sufficiently important to merit our treating of their journeys as official at the same time they seem to have thought that they could dispense with what they should have done, i.e., made a re quest through the Bahrain Government for our help in order to facilitate their private expedition. They may of course have feared that if they had done so. the Shaikh would have put difficulties in the way of their leaving. The point about this business as 1 see it is that We .. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf.jmmmm HHBBHMMMMMMHHHMMH - 2 - vVe might of course ask the Bahrain Government to inform us always when any of the A1 Khalifah intend to to leave Bahrain for another country and/mention whether they require any special facilities.DRAFT. Dear Consulate-General, The two Arab gentleBjen, mentioned in your letter No.1822(5/7/15-0 of 23rd November, 1949, were not 'sons of the Shaikh of Bahrain', but cousins of his, named Khalifah bin Mohammed and Salman bin Mohammed. They had with them one Alwan Effendi, who is an instructor in the Police her . The Political Agent asked them about tneir trip when they returned yesterday. They said that they went without visas because they understood that this Agency no longer grants them. (The fact is, as you a re aware, that recent regulations of the Iraqi Govern ment make It necessary for us to refer every request for a visa for Iraq to them through you). They 'heard that visas for landing in Iraq are granted by the Iraq Government authorities on the ship after it has arrived in port - this, they say r is the way in which the large number of Shia pilgrims from this part of the world get their visas at a charge of 2 dinars a time. They did not exactly say so, but we think we are right in saying that, as might be expected, it was this charge which really started the trouble. The Shaikhs protested against paying it for themselves and their large retinue and it was not ap parently until the Mutasarrif intervened that they were permitted to land without visas. About the cars, theyaay that Gray Mackenzies made a mistake in shipping them as freight, and if they had been shipped as part of their personal luggage, there would have been no ^.k,ri, rouble --- 2 - trouble in importing them into Iraq. This part of their story does not sound very con vincing. They had been in touch with Sayid Hamad al-Naqib, who they hoppd would facilitate their landing but who failed to meet them as * their ship arrived earlier than he expected. 2. The visit of these Shaikhs to Iraq was a purely private one for the purpose of sport, and though they might like to think themselves so, they are not really important enough to warrant treating all their movements on an official or semi-official basis. Indeed their venerable old father, who is a figure of some importance here, moves around many of the countries of the Middle East unheralded by the arrival of official telegrams. They should however have had sense enough to get the visa and other formalities right and this \ point is being brought to the notice of the Bahrain Government as is also the fact that if they were likely to need facilities and intro ductions to officials like the Mutasarrif they should have asked for them through the proper channels if they were unable to arrange for them privately themselves. 2. We are sorry you were inconvenienced and will tike steps tc avoid such an occurence in future. Ycurs ever,Telegram % From To No. Dated GTC Political i-^gent, Bahrain. H.M's Consul-General, Basrah 82. 22nd December, 1949. Shaikhs Dhaij bin Hamad, Abdullah bin Hamad, and Ahmed bin Hamad, with 20 servants, 3 cars and 14 guns propose to leave here by ’’Dumra” on De cember 28th and arrive Basrah December 30th en route to Amarah for 15 days shooting. Me are unable here to grant party visas for Iraq. Me eve informed by Baghdad that arrangements will be made for such travel lers to get an emergency visa at places where they ar rive in Iraq. &gt; •2. These Shaikhs are half brothers of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain and it may be useful to you to know that it would be appropriate for Iraq Govern ment if they so desire to grant them such courtesies as are accorded to distinguished visitors. i = POLITICAL = (Copy forwarded to the Residency with reference to P.ii's telephone conversation with the First Secretary on the 22nd December, 1949, under c.s.No.C/R-599 of 22-12-49)3 // i S &lt;&amp; Shaikhs Dhaij bin Hamad, Abdullah bin Hamad, and Ahmed bin Hamad, half brothers of His Highness the Ruler, with 20 servants and three cars intend to proceed to Basrah on the 28th December by the 'Dumra” en route to Amarah for 15 days shooting. They are taking 14 guns with hem. Their contact in Iraq is Mohd Saeed al Naqib who/^they say is a friend of theirs. The first action necessary is to find out how they should get visas for entry into Iraq. If necessary, we should blegraph Consul-General, Basrah,on this point. As these Shaikhs are however the brothers of the Ruler we will probably have to say that it would be appropriate to grant them sch courtesies as are extended to distinguis visitors. The Shaikhs asked me for the usual letter of good offices and that should be drafted and faired immediately. H.M. will do this. of which there is a cop i. The question of visas can therefore be regarded as settled as far as we are con- I have consulted and have issued the telegram cerned 22-12-49COrFIDEITTIi,! .

I also enclose a draft reply to the latter we received from Trevelyan in case you may wish to comment. I presume the facts about Ahmad Khaki Bey are correct ? C.J. 3.

They had with them one Alwan Effendi, who is an instructor in the Police here. The Political Agent asked them about their trip shortly after they returned. They said that they went without visas because they understood that this Agency no longer grants them. In this they were right because the arrangement by which we granted visas for 'Iraq to travellers from the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms was terminated last June at the Iraqi Governments re quest. Baghdad then informed us that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs had made arrangements for such travel lers to be granted emergency visas at places where they arrive in Iraq. (This is the way in which the large number of Shia pilgrims from this part of the world get their visas at a charge of 2 dinars a time.) They did not exactly say so, but we think we are right in assuming that it was this charge which really started the trouble. The Shaikhs seem to have protested against paying it for themselves and their large retinue and it was not apparently until the Mutasarrif intervened that they were permitted to land without visas. About the cars, they say that Gray Mackenzies made a mistake in shipping them as freight, and that if they had been shipped as part of their personal luggage, there would have been no trouble in importing them into Iraq.
