C. 188. THE PERSIAN QUESTION. Note by Sir Hamilton Grant, K.O.I.E. 1. As I did not perhaps at yesterday’s meeting of the Eastern Committee make sufficiently clear what I believe to be the constructive policy of the Government of India in Persia, I venture to submit the following note in amplification of what 1 said. 2. Three courses appear open :— (iii) to get a mandate for some other Power, e.g., America or Belgium, to undertake the task ; 3. The objections to (i) are :— (a) we should be abandoning a work upon which we have spent enormous sums of money and energy in past years; (b) some other Power would almost inevitably intervene sooner or later unless w r e could obtain a mandate from the Powers forbidding this. There would be obvious difficulty in obtaining such a mandate ; (c) there will be general chaos, which though in many places negligible so far as our interests are concerned, would certainly re-act unfavourably on our frontiers, both in the East and in the West; (d) we should be finally abandoning our commercial interests, and might be forced even to withdraw our Consuls and colonies throughout Persia. 4. The objections to (ii) are stated in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 26th November, and are briefly :— (a) that acceptance of such a mandate, unless coupled with a mandate from Persia herself, which in present circumstances would scarcely be forthcoming, would be a flagrant departure from our oft-repeated guarantee of Persia’s integrity; ..... (6; it would involve military and financial commitments of a serious kind unjustifiable so far as Indian interests are concerned ; (c) it would be difficult to find the necessary civil staffs; [d) the acceptance could only further emasculate Persia and render eventual withdrawal more impossible. 5. The objections to (iii) are that there is no other Power who would be likely to accept the responsibility and at the same time find the money and troops necessary for the purpose. If we are to find the money and troops we must obviously have a paramount voice in the direction of policy, and this would be impossible once w^e had handed over Persia to the tender mercies of another Powder. 6. This brings us to (iv), the course which, I think, the Government of India would advocate. An essential preliminary, however, to action on these lines is to regain the confidence of the Persian people and to induce them to welcome instead of resisting our attempts of assistance. When I outlined yesterday the steps which I proposed should be taken in order to regain the confidence of Persia, it was pointed out by Lord Curzon that we had practically taken all these steps already, and by Sir (i) for us to clear out of Persia entirely and leave it to stew T in its own juice without financial or other assistance ; (ii) to get a mandate from the Powers for us to run Persia, retaining our troops there indefinitely, and controlling the Government and practically administering the country; (iv) to continue ourselves, with or without a mandate, to assist Persia on a limited scale.o (Jh-irles Marling that announceinents ol any hind wore perfectly useless and that nothing we could say or do would have any effect on Persian public opinion. With all deference to Sir Charles Marliug’s intimate personal knowledge of 1 ersia, I venture lo submit that both his own and Sir Percy Cox’s telegrams have repeatedly indicated that there is a very real volume of public opinion in Persia which is strong enough to upset Governments and without the support ol which no r i mie 1 limstei can hold his own very long. Now, if there is public opinion of such an important character in Persia, it must obviously be subject to ordinary influences, and I maintain that if we only make an effort we ^can get* that public opinion on our side. I am under no delusions as to the general meanness and futility ol the 1 ersian character, but (here is undoubtedly, as Sir Charles Marling himself admitted yesterday, a curious kind of patriotism or nationalism which is neither to be bought nor overawed. It is, perhaps, akin to the political enthusiasm that braces the Bengali seditionist to walk bravely to the gallows; but whatever may belts psychology this feeling exists, and we must allow for it. As regards Lord Curzon’s criticism that we have practically done everything that 1 suggested yesterday, while fully admitting the accuracy of this, I would venture to suggest that the manner in which our various announcements and guarantees have been made has not been of a very convincing or ingratiating kind. There has been a want, if 1 may say so, of real frankness and kindliness about the tone of our communications to the Persian Government: in the words of the old song, “ p’s not exactly what we say but the nasty way we say it.” 7. i would suggest, therefore, that we should in the most public manner make a Declaration to the Persian Government in the following sense :— “ The exigencies of the war and circumstances arising from it, with which the Persian Government were unfortunately unable themselves to deal adequately, have compelled His Majesty’s Government, during the last four years, reluctantly to take action in 1’ersia which has not unnaturally aroused suspicion as to our intentions in regard to that country. Now that the war has been successfully terminated in our favour, His Majesty’s Government are anxious to regain the confidence of the Persian people, and to prove the sincerity of their oft-repeated declarations that the independence and integrity of Persia are their desire, and that they sincerely wish to have as their neighbour in the East a friendly and prosperous Persia. To this end His Majesty’s Government desire it to be known that during the period of the war they have rendered substantial financial assistance to the Persian Government (this might he elaborated in detail), and refrained from demanding the repayment of large and overdue debts ; they have made it a cardinal point in the Peace negotiations that Turkey should surrender every inch of Persian territory occupied by them ; in deference to public opinion they have agreed to abolish the South Persia Hides in Fars and to make them over to the Persian Government to form a part of such uniform army as hereafter may be raised in Persia ; they have further agreed to withdraw their troops from Fars as soon as order has been restored on the Bushire- Shiraz road, and hope shortly to give effect to this promise. Further, His Majesty’s Government have now decided finally to abrogate the 1907 agreement with Russia; to consider the revision of the Persian customs tariff at an early opportunity; to remove their troops from other parts of Persia as soon as circumstances, wrhich include the safeguarding of the Persian frontier on the north and the rendition of territory recently occupied by the lurks, permit; and finally to continue to the Persian Government for the time being such subvention as may be suitable to enable them to carry on the government of the country and restore reasonable law and order. In return all that His Majesty s Government ask of the Persian Government is that they will accept the assistance of British financial advisers in the regulation of their finances. As heavy creditors of the Persian Government, and in view of the subvention now promised, His Majesty’s Government feel sure that the Persian people will recognise the reasonableness of this demand, which is not intended in any way to infringe the sovereign rights or liberties of Persia. Indeed, without some safeguard of this kind His Majesty’s Government would obviously not be justified either in continuing a subvention or in postponing further their claim to the repayment of their just debts, furthermore, His Majesty’s Governmentwould be prepared to render the Persian Government such assistance as they may hereafter desire in the organisation of a uniform force and in the restoration oi law and order, though they have no intention whatever, in present circumstances, of forcing such assistance on the Persian Government contrary to the wishes of the Persian Government and people.” 8. This is a rough idea of what might be said, and 1 feel convinced that a Declaration on these lines would have very considerable effect particularly if it were followed in the near future by the withdrawal of our troops from Shiraz and the Bushire line. 9. As regards local arrangements for the maintenance of order, it should be the financial advisers’ first duty to see that adequate sums from the subvention were placed at the disposal of the various Local Governments for the maintenance of local forces; and our (Consuls should be authorised, on behalf of the financial advisers, to see that these sums were properly expended. The experiment might well be begun while our troops are still in Northern Persia. Their presence there should facilitate the work of the Local Governments concerned. 20th December 1918. A. H.

It concerns the future involvement of the Government of India in Persia. Grant suggests that the Government of India has the following options:to clear out of Persian entirely and 'leave it to stew in its own juice without financial or other assistance';to acquire a mandate to run Persia, retaining troops there, controlling the Government and practically administering the country;to acquire a mandate for some other power (such as America or Belgium) to undertake the task;to continue – with or without a mandate – to assist Persia on a limited scale.Grant goes on to list objections to the first three options before stating that the fourth course of action is the one that the Government of India would advocate. Grant cites the concerns of Sir Charles Marling [British Minister at Tehran] regarding Persian public opinion on the presence of the British in Persia. Grant concludes his note by proposing that a public declaration should be made to the Persian Government, in which His Majesty's Government would promise a number of actions – including the withdrawal of its military presence in Persia – in return for being able to assist the Persian Government in the regulation of its finances.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000181#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
