Regarding H.M*s Ambassador letter 162, dated S2nd M March 1954 in wiiich he criticized the Shaikh's figures for 1922 and 1933 and with which you were in part agreement, (Vide ^ Bushire confidential despatch No,477-S, dated 28th May 1934 0 to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India) I would refer you again to my confidential despatch No.0.157, dated 1st May 1934 and would very respectfully say that I feel compelled to y still hold the same views as I expressed then, 4, In that letter I pointed out that for political reasons and especially for the sake of our good name among Arabs we should not cavil at the Shaikh's figures, or attempt to 'whittle' down his claims, but accept them 'en bloc'. 5« I added that although it might be easy for those living at a distance to pick holes in the Shaikh's figunH and criticize the way he had presented his various claims, we should not forget that his was little more than a Bedouin State, and that the methods of his Agents and Clerical Staff were of the simplest imaginable. That as things were the Shaikh had done well to have kept serious accounts at all, and that the case he had presented was a reasonable and fair one, nor had he made the mistake of exaggerating. 6. Just in the same way as I supported the Shaikh's 1932 and 1933 figures, so now I am in favour of accepting his 1934 claims as they stand, seeing that we have already harmed the Shaikh and our good name to an immeasurable degree, by our third year failure to implement our promises in this matter of his gardens. We certainly want to give no encouragement to our Arab enemies (always active) to say, that even when His Majesty's G-ovemment did at length decide to settle the gardens question and reimburse the Shaikh for his losses, she only paid him half ndiat he claimed and got out of the other half by one sophist argument or another. 7. I quite realize - and I say this with all respect - that speaking from the British Taxpayers point of vie?;, both you and H.M's Ambassador, may find it somewhat hard to seeto see why His Majesty's Government should have to pay the Shaikii, for instance, for the immense losses (financial and otherwise) which he claims to have incurred in fighting his re calcitrant fellaheen. But, if we are to admit that the disturbances among the fellaheen originated, and have con tinued for the last 3 years as a result of direct encouragement and incitement of the Iraq Government, (of which in my opinion there can be no shadow of doubt) then surely His Majesty's Government must accept the responsibility, seeing that it was up to her to see that Iraq did not behave as she has done and allow her spite to outrun her reason. Let us not forget that until the Iraq Governmait got control, successive Shaikhs of Kuwait had never had any trouble at all with their tenants. 8. The Shaikh's ovsn way of putting it is that, as all his date garden difficulties, have arisen as a direct result of His Majesty's Government's failure to settle the Date garden trouble , and that as such failure has each year given added encouragement to the Iraq Government to intrigue among his tenants, and instigate them to refuse to pay him his landlord's share, and even challenge his title - therefore all expenses incurred by him in his lone fight for his rights, whether in the Basra Courts, or in the gardens themselves, should in justice be borne by His Majesty's Government, who after all did promise that his gardens should free of taxation ; be his, and remain unassailable. The least that His Majesty's Government could have to done, according to the Shaikh, ^iiould have been to appoint an English Lawyer to come out to Basra and conduct the fight that was going on in the local Courts and in the gardens. It was not enough to bring the diplomatic pressure they have done in Baghdad. 9. I earnestly trust that while there is yet time, you will see your way to modify some of the remarks passed in your letter No.477-S of 28th May 19554 to H.M's Secretary ofSecretary of State for India, and will use your utmost endeavour witb His Majesty's Government to prevent any vital ^whittling** down of the bhaikh's old 1952 and 1935 claims, and now his 19 34 ones. 10. As regards statement and enclosure: This I am passing on for your information only. Mr.Gabriel thought fit to send me at the beginning of the year a statement showing what he had done by way of service to the Shaikh s^ince he was appointed agent. Underlying the letter was his hope that I would speak to the Shaikh privately and get his pay raised. 11. The statement is interesting as showing among other things (a) Mr.Gabriel's conviction that the Iraq Government were behind all the garden troubles, and were therefore the last people it was wise for him to apply to for help: (b) The pitifully tortuous methods used by Mr. Gabriel in trying to get the better of rebellious fellaheen whom he knew were being supported by Gov ernme nt of f i c ia Is . 12. In putting forward Mr. Gabriel's report, I wish it to be understood that it should not be quoted as an authority, firstly because it was sent to me for my personal use only, and secondly because it contains a number of inaccuracies. 13. Mr.Gabriel, though apparently he has done his best in the face of many difficulties, for his client, has, I feel sure, been compelled to run with the hare as well as hunt with the hounds at timej; He has even confessed to me on more than one occasion that he has received many warnings from high Iraqi officials, that his taking up the cudgels on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait was a definitely unhealthy and dangerous occupation and would end in disaster for himself. Unfortunately politics appear to be so mixed up with the administration of justice in Iraq, that I doubt if the Shaikh could have/could have found a more satisfactory lawyer to serve him than Mr.Gabriel.

In other words that the •IRA^ Government stirred up the fellaheen to act as they did, as part of their general policy of attacking his exempted properties, which has been in progress these last three years: Hence he holds His Majesty^ GoTernment responsible for the above losses, and expects them to be made good under the 'exemption' promise of His Majesty's Government* (2) The various acts of sabotage and rebellion on the part of the Shaikh's Fao, and to a lesser extent the Faddaghiyeh fellaheen which caused the above losses to the Shaikh were fully dealt with in various despatches submitted by myself to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, at the time.Statement ¥• Showing expenses Incurred by Mr. Gabriel, our Agent at Basra, on account of hire of watchmen etc*, arising from the troubles of the fellaheeno Particulars.

(8) Details of above expenses have not been given of (a) to (h) above, but can no doubt be produced by the Shaikh^ Agent and Lawyer, Mr. Gabriel.

(4) The Shaikfe claims that, as all his date gardens troubles have arisen as a direct result of His Majesty's Govern ment third year failure to implement their promises in respect of the Shaikh's 'exempt gardens', especially when the 'Istihlak' system of taxation was introduced into ♦IRAQ,, which failure immediately encouraged the •IRAQ /g Government to attack Kuwait by intriguing among his tenant and causing them to rebel, refuse to pay the landlord's share, and to challenge his title, - therefore all the expenses incurred by him above in his lone fight for his rights whether in the Basra courts, or in the gardens themselves, should be in justice born by His Majesty's Government.Statement VI• Showing the grand totals of the losses inourredl as per the foregoing statements I, II, III, IV and V* Particulars, I.D.

AGENCY I was appointed as general agent for H.S. on and from the 1st January 1935 for a yearly retention fee of Rs. 2100/- on the clear under standing that I was only to act as lawyer for H.S. in the Law Courts in such law suits as might be rarely necessary to institute against some few troublesome fellahins.- 2 - LilW SUITS IH 19 55 . In February 1955, I was instructed through Abdul Aziz Salem al Bader, His ^xcellenoy^ previous general agent (dismissed for incompetence shortly afterwards) to file 35 suits far the recovery of arrears of dates due by certain Ta'abs in Fao{who had undoubtedly been got at by certain agents of the IRAQ, G-ovemment). But owing to non-existence of written contracts, the defendents submitted a written statement objecting to the ex-parte Judgement issued against tiiem by denying H.E's ownership to the Fao property (a step who were foreseen by tiiose/behind them). At this stage the said Abdul Aziz, notwithstand ing my warniog, filed an ejectment suit (through another lawyer whom he had appointed as sub-agent for H.S.) against the ring leader called Jassim Ala , ama who claimed in his defence (througli his lawyer Ibrahim Naji) that he and certain of his colleagues were the rightful owners of Fao property and not H.E, the Shaikh, whereupon Court ordered H.E's lawyer to pro duce a Tapu title deed to prove H.S's ownership, and the right to claim the ejectment of the defendent; and ffao property being of class 'A 11 no title deed was in existence, and therefore as a choice between evils the suit was dropped, under my advice, by non appearance of H.E's aforementioned sub-agent ( It was for this that the Shaikh's previous Agent was dis missed) • ADVICE . Having studied the whole position and under the circumstances X advised H#iS« not to take any legal action unless:- (1) The Fao property be registered in Tapu. (2) Letters of Administration be obtained inHis Sxoellenoy^s favour. (3) Transfer of the properties class 'B' and 'C' from the name of the deceased owners be effected in the name of their respective legal living survivors. (4) The Shaikh's local representatives at Fao be removed. (5) H.E's secretary and his attaches be precluded from interfering in the affairs of administration of H. E's properties in Basrah district. (6) A responsible agent be appointed and invested with full authority for administration and general management. GONFIDMCE &amp; ATOIQRITY . His Excellency very kindly placed his confidence in me and not only appointed me his le^er and agent but gave me full authority to do what I thought fit (a) In keeping up his prestige (b) In safeguarding his interests; but H.E, at the seme time pointed out that under existing circum stances it was practically impossible for him to comply with my aforesaid advice in the matter of paragraphs (l) to (3) above for reasons given elsewhere and known to you. REMEDY . Seeking redress in the Courts under the conditions and circumstances prevailing at the time, was in fact quite impossible, and as to the G-ovemment Administrative authorities, no assistance could be expected of them, so I was indeed in a very critical position during the 1933 (SEPT.) date season in as much as the crop was ripe, and the Ta^b were at the height of their opposition and disturbance. I therefore adopted a diplomatic attitude towards them and appointed their abovementioned 'ring leader' (Jassim A1 A , ama as my representative on a salary of Rs. 150 a month, and gave certain wages and privileges to his companions. He and his companions accepted the appointment provided (l) that all i&amp;e law suits pending against them in the courts were forthwith dropped (2)tMt they be allowed to divide the produce on 50 and 50 basis. To this I agreed on condition that they for thier part undertook in writing to deliver His Excellency^ share without specifying the basis of division in the contract. MTICEMSNT . The aforesaid arrangement was carried out quite loyally and peacefully almost by all the Ta^bs and every thing seemed bright. But due to the interference of His Excellency's secretary, sone fifteen head ta^bs presented themselves in Kuwait aiid offered to deliver 56^ of the produce to His Excellency alleging that all other ta'abs would follow suit; and despite my appeal, His Excellency believed them and revoked my arrangements. I had therefore to submit to His Excellency's will. The said head ta^bs returned to Fao # But only about 200 ta'abs out of nearly 1000 signed the contracts for Nevertheless, some of these refused to deliver either the whole or part of the quantity guaranteed, for the recovery of which I had after wards to apply to the court. * DlgFIGULTIES . When my above plans were upset the ring leader and his companions became very furious, and resolved to carry out the battle at all costs, and being encouraged, chiefly by * AbdulU Faleh As Sa*adoon*s*sons and also by certain other persons Beg and ^ others who it is polite not to mention, they set to work. At this time the Shaikh's local headmen of Faddagliyeh and Mutawa properties with some of their followers joined, ^ % Jassim all first secretly and then openly with the above ring leader ^a land by the date season of 1954 all the Ta'abs at Fao and Fallahins at Faddaghiyeh revolted openly. ACTION In view of the foregoing it seemed imperative to and decisive action take strongs/and even though such an action would call forthe sacrificing of the whole produce of one season, otherwise Ihere would be no end to all such troubles, were it necessary to depend solely and always on the localadministrative authorities who (although not without repeated petitions helped sometimes, and to a- certain extent) did not seem very pleased with the job. I therefore decided to carry out the following plans (1) I appointed one Yusuf A1 ♦Ali (a strong and energetic ex-servant of Shaikh Khazal) as my representa tive for the time being at Fao» Another ex-police corporal as an assistant representative at Faddaghiyeh, and one of my own ex-servants as an assistant representative at Mutawa. Keshaishiya and Sarhaniya being two insignificant plo'ts I attached them to Faddaghiyeh as they are situated in the neighbourhood thereof. (2) i sent out sixty watchmen to Faddaghiyeh and about five hundred others to Fao, with three motor launches to guard against danger of the Fallah's selling the prodikce by land and by sea, and by this means the Ta f ab and Fallahins were prevented from tampering with the produce in any manner whatsoever. (4) I filed fifty three cases for 1iie recovery of arrears, against the most troublesome of the ta^bs basing my claim on the documaits taken fron them the previous year, and I secured orders for provisional attachment, before judgement, of their respective shares in the present crop (1934). Some of these men were from those who had guaranteed last year to deliver 56%. RESULTS . The watchmen at Fao continued at their posts for nearly three months, and when the ta'abs to their great astonishment and regret found out that their instigators were absolute 'liars', and that others bad deceived them # in telling them that H.E. had rebuked me for my actions— -■&gt; and for involving him into a heavy expenditure, and that I had been bidden by H,E. to withdraw the guards both by land and sea', they surrendered; but I declined to accept their submission unless (1) they delivered 56% of the produce as H.S's permanent rightful share, and (2) they signed and registered with the Notary Public the Ta 1 aba (a contract whereby the ta f ab admits the ownership of H.S. and defines himself a ta'ab under certain conditions), Rqj&amp;lSTr&amp;TlQN OF CONTRACTS , MUTAWA t A - Contracts have been, completed and they are now in my safe. F a DDAGHIYEH - are being registered and I hope to complete same very soon# - nearly half is in the course of registra tion, the rest are refusing to sign, but I am confident that they will sooner or later have to sign. PROMISS FOR LOAN . Fallaheen as promised were given a loan of Rs. 2000/- immediately after complet ing their contracts before the Notary Public. Fellahen will be given as promised about Rs # 6000/- immediately after their res pective admission of Iheir contracts. - Fallaheen have been promised a loan of about Rs. 15000/- which will be given to them when all their respective contracts are completed with the Notary Public. COMMENTS . Usually every land owner who is in a position to prove his title to the land by Tapu Deed feaoi has, according to law, to apply to the Court for an order of e^ectmeait of his Ta'ab, provided he pays him the value of his labour and plantations, that may be assessed by a commission appointed by order of the Court. The minimum of such valua tion is ten annas per palm tree. There are over 300,000/- plam trees at Fao alone the value of which would approximately come to Rs. 200,000/- but without title of ownership it is almost impossible to FAO MUTAWA'A FADDAGHIYEH FAO- 7 - claim e.1ectment « Further the Government Administrative authorities, strictly speaking, are precluded by law from ejecting anyone who may ri^itly or wrongly be in possession of a landed property. THE BMSFITS 0? CONTRACTS . The benefit of the registered contracts executed by the Fallaheens and/or the Ta f abs are:- (1) The establishment of legal title of ownership. (S) The defining of rights of ownership. (3) The prevention of d.isturbances affecting the rights of owhership # (4) The right to claim ejectmmt. (5) The non necessity for applying to the G-overnment Administrative authorities for help. In as much -i . l experience has proved beyond a shadow of douht s ,that^the less one seeks Government's help the better and safer it is. THE BENEFITS OF LOAMS . Perhaps I might have displeased H.E. by my continual recommendations and request to increase the volume of loans to the ta'abs. The Ta^abs at Fao alone have been in debt to H.E up to date for about Rs. 30,000/- including arrears last gear's crop. I have now promised to make to them a further loan of Hs. 15,000/- this year (excluding Rs # 5000 worth of arrears of this year's crop). So the aggregate amounts due by them will be about Rs. 50,000/-. This figure will never be increased in future, and I propose not to worry about its collection in this, and pethaps in the next five years. The reason is obvious, seeing that any ta'ab who might be tempted to renew the past troubles will immediately be attached with a law suit for the recovery of the money due from him and his ta'aba (land) will consequently be attached and sold by auction, when I will step in to purchase same for and in the name of H.E # for one fourth of its real value, in satisfaction of the decretal amount, whereupon thexJuUd ta'ab will be ejected- 8 - by the execution department without further independent legal action, for his ejectment. ORGANIZATION . There is hardly need to describe the state of affairs when I took over the charge from the previous agent {Abdul Aziz as Salim). In one word there was nothing at all to take charge of, no accounts and no rent agreements, even for Basrah city properties, so that I could not even claim b/ the evacuation of any building occupied any tenant. n Today everything has been organized by me and no tenant can withhold H.S's rights. There are in my office now about 1000 files ten registeres and account books, and otl^er printed forms, receipts etc; all in connection with H.E's Ta^bs, Fellaheen, tenants and other various subjects. CULTIVATION . Owing to the continuous disturbances and also the negligence of the last few years the date gardens have now decayed very badly; furthermore the ta^bs have been even permitted to build shops and houses, leasing them for their mink sole benefit and in their own name, as though they are themselves the rightful owners of the land. Effective steps are now being taken (1) to prevent the ta'abs from erecting buildings on H.E. the Shaikh's lands, (2) calling upon those who have previously built to execute an agreement of lease, (3) erecting new suitable buildings in the name of and fl&gt;n behalf of H.E. and advertising same for a very low rent with a view of enticing the occupants of the shops and houses, built previously by ta'abs, to leave them and occupy those newly built by me, so 'that the ta^abs build ings may ultimately become useless and lastly (4) culti vating the gardens and preparing same for new plantations. PRODUCE . FAO - For years past has not yielded more than ten thousand maunds yearly, as His Excellency's share. This year the actual yield received as His Excellency's share was abi&amp;ut 20,000/- maunds, excluding the arrears of some 3000/- Mftfeds.- 9 - MUTAWA * A — Yielded lOOOmamids more than the pro- dikoe of many years past. The actual previous yield has not been much more than 4000 maunds yearly. This year there were about 5000 maunds. FADDAGHIYSH - This year the crop was damaged by the disease called 'Al Humera' and there- fore there was a natural shortage - yet even so there was about lO^o excess in comparison to the neighbouring estates. Year by year the produce will be increased, and I can confidently assert that at the end of the next five years the produce may be double of what it is this year. CONCLUSION . Before concluding I wish to express my sincerest thanks to His Excellency who having encouraged me by placing his valuable confidence in me and by investing his full authority in nyxJaanci me has placed me in a position whereby I could go ahead and spend as much money as I may have thought necessary for:- (1) Safeguarding his interests. (2) Bringing the disturbers of his rights to their sense, and (5) Organizing the managemait and administration on a legal basis. SALARY. My office staff etc* costs me about Rs. 4000 yearly and therefore there is hardly need to say that equity and justice alone may encourage m^to taEHpxsijJxmjcxisf^jaEB ask for a very substantial salary to enable me to keep up my office staff and continue to carry out my responsible task as satisfactorily, in every respect , as may be exp®Aed of me.&gt; C0NFIP3IWIAL. POLITIGiiL AQaMCY, No.0-344. KUWAIT. The 1st August 1935.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose translation of a letter No.R-4/2117, dated 26th July 1954, which I have received from the Deputy Ruler of Kuwait including enclosures as under:- tf A tt Letter No •Nil, dated 23rd July 1935 from Mr. J.Gabriel, Pleader, Basra to the Shaikh of Kuwait, 'B' Letter No.7551 dated 2Snd July 1935 frcm the Mutasarrif, Basra to Mr.Gabriel. '0' Letter No.7552, dated 22nd July 1935 frcm the Mutasarrif, Basra, to respectively Mr.Gabriel and K.B.Mirza Mohamad, Agent for H.E.Shaikh Khazaal Khan. 2. From the above you will see that neither Mr . Gabriel nor H.E. the Shaikh know^what exactly the Mutasarrif of Basra is driving at, or what he means when he says that the enormous sum of I.D.7250.737 is due frcrn the Shaikh of Kuwait on account of 'Land Taxes' and 'Badal Jareeb' of his date gardens situate in the Fao Nahiya. Nor is it made clear for what perio d these supposed Taxes are due, and whether they were incurred during Turkish times, the British Occupation, or after the present Arab Government came into power. 3. As far as I can make out, but this must be taken as pure conjecture at present, the bill I.D.7250.737 would seem to represent an attempt to extract from the (k) V Shaikh, the value of certain 'Shawati' or silt areas, which have been recovered from the river by the Shaikh'sShaikhs Fao fellaheen, and which by Turkish Law had to be purchased (in practice this was scarcely ever done) by the owner of the property, which benefited^ The transaction was known as 'Badal Mithai' - and the figure supposed to be paid per Jareeb (Acre) was Rs.100/- or thereabouts* Government were then supposed to give the garden owner a special Tapu deed for the new bit of land so acquired^ 5. If this is what the Mutasarrif is after, then the Shaikh would appear to have every right to resist the demand for the following reasons:- (a) Silt Land acquired from the river is recovered very slowly indeed, and it would be quite impossible for the Shaikh to have recovered some 1000 acres (which the value of the demand presupposes that he has) unless the Mutasarrif is basing his calculations on something recovered in far off Turkish times, and dating over a period of anything upto a 100 years* (b) The Shaikh has never been warned, that Government 'assessors' e were at work, or intended measuring up land considered to have been gained frcm the river - nor does his agent appear to have been told anything about it at all* (c) Presumably the Iraq Government has the right to take'Badal Mi thai' in cases affecting the Shaikh*s 'exempt' gardens, only fran the date on which she became an independent nation, and not for any period of the British Occupation, or i/yhen Turkey was the paramount power (i.e* prior to 1914) „ (d) There is no attempt to show how the Mutasarrif*s figures have been arrived at* (e) No mention is made of the position or size of the supposed measured 'Shawatis'* 6*/1/ 6. I should say hazarding a guess, and from the very large sum involved, Viz I .D.7250• 737, that something of the following actually happened. The Mutasarrif ordered the Mudir of Fao Nahiya to secretly measure up those river-side strips of the Shaikhs Fao gardens which he thought l ooked like land recovered frcm the river quite irrespective of when it was so recovered , and submit the value of them at the rate laid down by Turkish Law, namely the equivalent of Rs.lOO/- per Jareeb. This naturally would result in a monstrous injustice. 7. One thing is as certain as the ligtit of day, it would be physically impossible for land to the value of I.D.7250.737 to have been recovered by the Shaikh*s Fellaheen in the short period during which the Iraq Government has had its independence. 8. I greatly fear that, we have here another attempt on the part of the Iraq to get at the Shaikh, and I should not be at all surprised if there was a connection between H.E.Nuri Pashas visit to Basra in the latter half of July 1935 with the Mutasarrif♦s present demand. The latter 1 s demand it will be noticed is dated the 22nd July 1935. 9. Whether however Nuri Pasha be involved or not, this fresh attempt to 'get at' the Shaikh during his absence in England, shows up none too well, in the light of Mr.Renders note of 11th June 19 35 on the talk he had with Nuri Pasha in London recently, copy of which was forwarded to me under your Printed Letter No.478-3, dated Bushire the 8th July 1935. 10. Whether I am right or wrong in assuming that 'Shuwati' 1 lands are referred to the matter under discussion, I nevertheless hold strongly to the opinion that until the Iraq G-overnment have officially validated the Shaikh^s title to his five 'exempt' properties and issued him with brand new Tapu Documents, they should postpone all attempts to recover the value of land recovered from the river by 'Badal Mithai' method - And even then the work will have to- 4 - have to be mo^t carefully done, to prevent land recovered, prior to the advent of the Arab Government being included. In the present instance the Mutasarrif would appear to be trying to extract money from the Shaikh for land recovered on the riverside of the Fao Estates which are not even held under Tapu. 11, In the meantime and in answer to the bhaikh of Kuwait f s letter to me under reference, I have verbally told him to write, and instruct Mr»Gabriel to address the Mutasarrif officially and find out exactly what the meaning of this latest demand is. Further I have told the Shaikh that on no account should he let his lawyer pay anything, so long as the whole question of n title 1 * of the al Uibah date gardens is being fought out by His Majesty's Government, I have the honour to be.

Compensation for losses incurred by the Shaikh of Kuwait as a result of the introduction by the Iraq Government of Istahlak Tax. ^ j.. . Reference British iiimbassy, Baghdad letter to Hi s i^Iajesty* s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No♦498,'' dated I7th September 19 35, As His Majesty's Government will no doubt shortly be considering the question of the Shaikh's claims for compensation for losses incurred by him, as a result of the introduction of Istahlak Tax, whether these be direct or indirect, I venture respectfully to suggest that the best way to arrive at a fair and equitable decision as regards the admissibility of the Shaikh's claims, will be to refer the matter to a group of disinterested persons, preferably Law Officers. In referring the matter to them, the latter could be asked to examine the whole correspondence from the beginning and give their considered decision as to what in fairness should be paid to the Shaikh and what should not. My reason for making the above suggestion is that in this question of the shaikh's claims for compensation, the matter is clearly one between the Shaikh and His Majesty's Government, and the form3r is trying to get something out of the latter which he2 u he considers is due to him by right. His Majesty's Government as well as ourselves (H.M's ximbassador, yourself and myself) oannot, I think, be considered as entirely free from bias since we oannot but have at the back of our minds the interest of the British Taxpayer. This is not unnatural. Hence and in order that the Shaikh may get a perfectly fair deal, and have no excuse later to complain that judgement in the form of a decision was given against him by the very party against whom he was striving to get compensation, I suggest that a perfectly neutral body be summoned to decide the matter. If this is done the Shaikh, I am sure, will be fully satisfied whatever be the nature of the 'award* of such a person or persons. 4. As regards the advisability of such a step on grounds of policy, my views are as given in paras 6 and 7 of my despatch No.G-242, dated the 29th July 19S5, forwarding statements of losses for 1934, and at so many previous oc casions. 5. In conclusion I trust that you will examine my suggestion favourably, and if you see no objection, will pass it on to His Majesty's Government for their consideration. I should like to add here that if we failed to take this step of our own accord, the Shaikh is sure later to turn round and say that His Majesty f s Governments decision was far from being a fair one, and he for ever afterwards will have a grievance.

I shall doubtless be esked for my views in due course and in the meantime should like to nave yours, which please let me have as briefly as possible without approaching the Shaikh at this stage. 3. Prragraphs 1 and 2 of the despatch need no comments. 4. With regard to paragraph 3. (i) Presumably tne Shaikh could register in tapu these accretions. (ii) Prima facie once the land is registered in the nrme of the Shaikh could not the Shaikh settle with all the 'Trabin** as he has already done with some ? (iii) Personally X do not think that the danger of any of the Shaikh's family doing this is great ? 5. With regard to paragraph 4. The first part of this paragraph turns on the answer to 3 (il) above. 6. I entirely disagree with the statement in paragraph 4 that n lt is true that, if the Shaikh were deprived of any of his property for some of the repsons set out above - I fm thinking particularly of the possibility of actions being brought / Lieut.-Colonel H.R .P.Dickson,C.I.K., Political Agent, Kuwait.h brought ageinet him by members of his own family - His Majesty's Government might consider that neither tney nor the Iraqi (iovern- ment could be called upon to compensate the Shaikh under the promises made to him in 1914'. His Majesty's s promise referred categorically to property of which the Snaiicn wps In possession at tnat time and not merely to property which, 20 years later, under the quibbles of Iraqi I pw he is now found t o • 7 # He: the Commission proposed by the Ambassador in his paragraphs 5 end 6» Prima facie the proposal it s advantages, but it would seem essenti'l both from His Uajesty's Governments point of view and the Shaikhs that the Commission should be a mixed one: an undiluted Iraqi Commission would I imagine not be rcceptable to the Shaikh, nor probably to His Majesty^ Government, One Iraqi and one British Official - an officer with Settlement experience from India who would represent the Shaikh and His Majesty's Government, might form a suitable personnel. But quite possibly the Iraqi Government would not agree to a foreign official sitting on a Commission derling with property within Iraq # 8. The first sentence of Ambassador's paragraph 6 is not perhrps very cle p r, but I assume it has the following meaning A B A .B.C.D. s Property claimed by Hhaikh. ( ID /( (1) of Ambassador's paragrapn 5 only mentions 'boundaries of all l^nds clfimed by the Shaikh'. He has, however, as I under stand it acquired fresh lands since 1914, by secretion and perhpps purchrse V His Majesty's Government's promise will not, of course, cover such additions. An additional point to be decided by the commiBSion might therefore be to enquire into the boundaries of the land helci by the Shfi*~kh in 1914. This point, however, is of more interest to His M&amp;Jest^s Government in virtue of their 1914 promise than to the Iraqi Government, and might form part of a sepf-rate enquiry conducted by His Majesty' 0 Government with^ie participation of the Iraqi Government, though the enquiry might make use of the findings of the Commission. J The value of the shaded portion, lost by the Shaith, would have to be given to him by His Majesty's Government under tneir promise. The Iraqi Government will certiinly never pay it, and tne Shaikh should certainly not have to buy back the land himself. Whether he actuplly bought it back, or whether he kept the money received from His Majesty's Government in his pocket, would be his own affair. 9 E. F. G.

I say this because I understand that under a law quite recently promulgated in Iraq, no non-Iraqi will in future be allowed to register property in Tapu, that is to say, buy any property or add to any already in his possession. How far this will apply to the Shaikh who owns already property adjacent to the accretions I cannot say. In this connection, the only accretions that I know of are certain silt strips known, as ft Shalhas lf or tt £)hawatis ?T which have been recovered from the river. These are mentioned in ^nnexure I - ^1 Mutaaw'ah' sub para (ii)' , of my Secret Despatch No,0-294, dated 15th November 1954 - jand .janexure I /&amp; 5 n Al j'auda^hiyeh ^ , sub para (f),' of the same despatch There are no accretions that I icnow Oj . on the land side fit ^ / w (ii) ,t \ The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C-Fcwle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf , B U d H I H ^ .- 2 - ?« ( (ii) Yes,of course the Shaildi could ana would settle with, his !t taabin !t , as he, together with other owners have done for Many years past, if only these ft taabin Tt 5 be left alone by Govamiiient ana not interfered with. Many estates on the Shatt al xirab apart from those owned by Hie Shaikh have countless ^taabin' tenants and there is no question ever of ejecting this class of person, who ha SI definite rights. The fact of the Shaikh being given a Tapu bariad of his own, does not in any way affect the rights of 'taabin Tt , who as the name implies originally planted the trees and so cannot be turned out, as an ordinary fellah can be. | (iii)There is no danger of this happening in my opinion unless the Iraq G-o v e rumen t, by me alas of successful - - , , I - intrigue among the aw /LX 0 cxD. OO Lu. d. ^ 't OXtX 0 do so. But this is a very remote possibility and would have to be counteracted here. 2 # Regarding para 4 of the ^Ambassador's letter (mention ed in para 5 of your D # 0 # ): I do not quite follow the last ■ five lines at bottom of page ^ of the embassador* s letter. The rights of a n taab ,t have nothing whatsoever to do witta the rights of a Tapu San ad holder, so 1 cannot see how the Shaikh's 'title' 1 to parts of the Faddaghiyeh, can ever 'be challenged by the Taabin*. Their (the taabin) rights, extend almost entirely to the question of evictment, nothing more. 4. I most emphatically agree with via at you say in para 6 of your D.O. your 5. Heference/para 7; As you say the 'Commission' idea has its advantages but I would prefer to see an Iraqi and a Kuwaiti sit on it with a British oxiicial with settlement e«xperience acting as President (or 'S/atchei of liis xiajesty s Government's interests), if this could be woiked. One person would certainly have to be kept out of the Commission, I thinfc. That is Jar dine , the present lana1 - o ' land settlement officer in Iraq* C - Between ourselves, Jardine aired his anti-Kuwait viewi -W''M^w T|| -. 1|Tnnnv| . | Jul! 1 1 -TniTii ii mil ,, , ,, where gardens were ooncerned, so unwisely and openly when he was adviser in Basra, that the Shaildi looks upon him as one of the chief enemies behind all his garden troubles. 3ntre nous I am not at all sure that he is not the person mentioned by the embassador in his para 5,as having given him certain advice, Regarding your para 8. I think the -ambassador's If o. meaning is as you have put it, though I fancy the land acquired from the river (as far as I kno¥7 there has been none purchased) will on investigation turn out to be a comparatively siaall amount. 7, (a) My own view is, that in the case of the Faddaghiyeh, fresh Tapu janads could be given without any difficulty at all, as old ones exist already (issued by oir Henry Dobbs in 1914) and can be merely copied (all -except the Ba&amp;yeh one), from those self same Sanads. There are S2 oanads in all (vide annexure I of my despatch G-294 of 15th November 19 34)- ^ % ' Then it could be easily discovered by measuring the area given . on the original Sanads, with what is on the ground, haw much fresh land had been acquired since 19 14. The ohaikh could then be asl^d to buy this fresh bit, and take out another Tapu Sanad for sanB. (b) similar methods could be applied in the case of the ^Mutaaw'ah' property. V -rsfv^'.- '' : ' v r ' •' '**' ' - ' ' ■ (c) A1 ^arhaniye h and a I Ujairawiyeh are very small and have had no 'additions' tacked on to them at all, I think. (d) There remains the ?ao property. Th§i the suggested commission could tackle in the following or'aer:- ■ (i) jfind out what its exact extent was in 19 14, by means of witnesses etc. as well as careful 100.1 »qai r ,. Tt. (ii) Then the Jhaikh could be given Tapu Sanads i ii i ; ij for this (iii)/- 4 - (i i i ) *-tS.s tly fclis &lt;a.ccx &gt; Qlji ons tiititi iisici bsGii c^d-dGo. on since 1914 oould fairly easily be estimated, and the oiiaiKh coald be asked to buy those out, and take fresh Tapu oanads for them. The point to rem ember being that the boundaries of the property as it stood in 19 14 must first be discovered and disposed of by issue of Tapu deed. (a) All this dragging in of 'Taabin^ rights etc. etc. merely tends to cloud a simple^ I think, and is unnecessary. ^f) The whole question turns on whether the Iraq Government are imbued with good will, and genuinely want to find out what the ohaikh/s rights are, or whether they want to deprive him of his properties by attacking secretly with one hand and raisins difficulties where there is a prospect of settling them.

On receiving a copy of Confidential despatch Nor G/128 of the 7th May addressed to you by the Political Agent at Kuwait, I coinmunicated the views expressed therein to the Director of the Port of Basra and suggested that he should visit Kuwait and discuss the matter personally with the Shaikh. Colonel Ward replied that he was too busy to pay a visit to Kuwait at that time and he fur ther pointed out that, even if his position as an Iracxi Government official had not precluded his approaching the Shaikh for the land at any stage, it was now quite impossible for him to do so since he nad, m the first instance, applied to the Government in the belief that the land was their property. It appeared to him, therefore, that all he could do was to find another site. This seemed to settle the matter, and I hoped that I should hear nothing more of it. Colonel ward has now informed me, however, that he has been unable to find any other site which would he suitable for his reauire ments and that further information which he has received, has con firmed his conviction that the land wider discussion does not belong to the Shaiich. A report submitted to him by one of his British officials, who has made careful enquiries, states that the land m question lies to the west of the bunds which, according to local opinion, mark the boundary of the lands loiown to belong to the Hon'ble Shaikh Lieutenant-Colonel T. C.¥. Powle, C.B.S., oil .-ical Resident in the Persian G-ulf BhSHiaa. ' '/' ■ V british embassy, bagdad Shaikh. tjnfortionately, however, the.sre hunds' are not identical with the British ouilt 'bund recognized by the Shaikh as marking the boundary of his property (see paragraph 10 (f) of Colonel Dickson's above quoted despatch), but are situated further to the west. The land required by Colonel Ward lies partly between the two bunds ana partly to the west of both. The cause of the diffi culty would therefore appear to be a definite difference of opinion regarding the extent of the Shaikh's property. 4. Meanwhile, the llutasarrif of 3asra has informed Colonel Ward that the Ministry of Finance have approved his application for the land in question and has advised him to arrange with the Tapu Department for the necessary transaction to be carried out. Colonel Ward has promised to take no action in the matter until I have had time to consult with you. It is clear, however, that, m view of this new development, he cannot hold his hand much longer. moreover. Colonel Ward emphasizes that, for the health of his staff, it isabsolutely necessary for him to have the land m question; and he further points out that his building up of Pao is greatly adding to thevalue of the adjoining property, whilst the actual piece of land in question is barren and salty, and, unless built up, can be of but little value. . 5. After carefully studying all the correspondence which has passed on this subject, I cannot help feeling that the following two points are clear: (a) that Colonel Ward applied for the land on his own initiative and under the sincere conviction that it belonged to the Iraqi Government and that there can, therefore, be no question of an Iraqi plot to dispossess the Shaikh, and (b) that it is in fact extremely doubtful whether the land m question does belong to the Shaikh. in these , 1 re„.t.„e.a 1 a„ net feel i„ „ oueoUne KM to ael w M. p lm . aoneer , a „ a 1 sliall ^ gi&gt;a ^ ^ soonv - o british embassy, bagdad soon as possible whether you agree that I have no alternative but to tell him that I do. not wish any longer to stand in his way. o. If, m spite oi' the considerations set out above, it is still desired that I should take further action on behalf of the Shaikh, i feel that I should be supplied with evidence in support of the Shaikh's claim to the land, which would be strong enough for successful production in a court of law. 7.

They would suggest that, while those comments are awaited, further information should be sought on certain points connected with the new factors mentioned in Sir Aithibald Clark Kerr's despatch. 3. It would be desirable to know whether land reclaimed from the Shatt-el-Arab adjoins all the Sheikh's estates which are covered by the pledge, and if not, which; for what reasons the Sheikh has refrained from claiming registration of this land; and whether there is Einy reason to suppose that, if such a claim were made, rival claimants would appear, or other obstacles arise. 4. The nature of the 'Taab' rights referred to in the despatch is far from clear to Their Lordships. They would be glad of a fuller explanation of this. It is not altogether clear whether the 'taabin' are claimants to the ownership The Under Sec:etary of State, foreign Office.of the land, and whether the success of the 'taahin' plaintiffs would result in the Sheikh's dispossession.

With reference to correspondence ending with India Office Express Letter 'lo* P.Z. 9/36, dated the 10th January . v ,.. 1936, I have the honour, after discussion with Colonel -o i. 11 ^ I ' Dickson, to submit the f llowing views on despatch No.629 (14/46/35) dated the 28th November 1935 from His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad, to His Majesty's Secretary of Hate for Foreign Affairs. 2. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the despatch call for no comments« 3. With regard to paragraph 3. (i) Colonel Dickson reports that the Shaikh of Kuwait could register these accretions on the river banks provided the Iraq Government puts no difficulty in the way of his doing so. The chief accretions are those made to the A1 Mutaew'ah, A1 Faddaghiyeh and A1 Fao, estates ^ifide paragraphs I (e), II (b) and IV (c) of Annexure I to Colonel Dickson's list, forwarded under my despatch Ko#1086 -3 of 24th November - 1934). / 15s V)1^1 -2- 1954). There are none that Colonel Dickson knows of on tne land side. (ii) It seems to me that n taab w rights are quite distinct from the question of securing the Shaikh a legally valid and unassailable title by the grant of a sanad in Tapu. Our responsibility begins end ends with placing the Shaikh in legal possession of his estates. Having done that he must settle his difficulties with his tenants like any other land owner. His Majesty's Ambassador has mentioned that the Shaikh has made private settlements with many of the 'taebin* 1 on his Faddaghiyeh estate. Colonel Dickson is of opinion that the ShF ikh could and would settle with the remainder. His difficulty in doing so hitherto has been due to the insecurity of his title, which has lead some of his 'taabin' 1 to demand more than their rights. (iii) Colonel Uickeon thinks, and I agree, that the danger of any of the Shaikh's family doing this is remote; it would be the business of the Shaikh to check any ten&amp;mxcy in this direction# 4. With reference to paragraph 4 of the despatch. (a) The first part of this paragraph, regarding the possibility of challenge to the Shaikh's title by his 'taabin*, is dealt with in ray paragraph 3 (ii) above. (b) As regards challenge to his title by members ' f his own family, as mentioned in my paragraph 3 (iii) above, this possibility is remote. Our object is to secure the Shaikh in the kind of ownership which he claimed in 1914. If his ownership was partly in the nature of a trust i.e. if some of the properties concerned were then held by him on behalf of the Sabah family, then the Shaikh could not reasonably in //o ^ -3- in respect of these now claim the rights of a sole owner, nor, on the strength of His Majesty's Governaient' s undertaking in 1914, claim compensation for loss of property belonging to individual members of the Sabah family by reason of action on their part. As mentioned in paragraph 3 (iii) above, it would be for the Shaikh, in his own interests and that of the whole Sabah family, to meet any danger of this nature, 5, v /ith regard to the Conimission proposed by His Excellency The Ambassador in his paragraphs 5 and 6# Prima facie , the proposal has advantages but it would seem essential both from the point of view of His Majesty's Government, and that of the Shaikh, that the Commission should be a mixed one; a purely Iraqi Gommission would not, I imagine, be accepta He to the Shaikh, nor, probably, to His Majesty's Government. One Iraqi and one Britisn official - say an officer with Settlemeni experience from India, who would represent the Shaikh and His Majesty's Government, might form a suitable personnel^ and the choice of such an officer would be less likely to give rise to complaints from either party of bias than if the British representative were an official from Iraq or the Persian Gulf. It is possible, however, that the Iraq (jovernment may object to a foreign official sitting on a Commission dealing with property within Iraq, On the other hand, the fact that the question is one involving the interests of His Majesty's Government and the independent iuler of Kuwait, furnishes a strong argument for their having a representative on the Commission. 6. I am glad to note from the correspondence ending with -ndia Office letter Ho. P.zi.9/36 of 10th January 1936 to i the /the Foreign Office that His Majesty's Secretary of State for India agrees that it would be undesirable, despite the present proposal for a Gommissi on, to defer consideration of the question of refunding to the Shaikh of Kuwait the amounts which he hf s been compelled to pay in taxes since 1932 of India, His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad, and the Political Agent, Kuwait.

WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 17th January, 1936. My dear Bennett, Please refer to tiie reoent correspondence about the question of compensating the Sheikh of Koweit for the taxation of the produce of his date gardens. When we consider the Ambassador 1 s proposal for dealing with the possession difficulty, we shall have also to consider how much longer we can defer compensation in respect of taxation. If such compensation can be paid in a lump sum, which we should strongly favour, financial considerations point to an early settlement, since we shall presumably have to compensate for taxation losses already sustained in addition to compounding for the future at X years 1 purchase, and X will not diminish through delay. Thus the longer we wait, the more it will probably cost. On looking at the question, however, one possible difficulty in the way of lump sum compensation occurs to us. We promised the late Sheikh that the gardens would Sterndale Bennett, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office, S. W. 1.remain in his possession and in possession of his descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts. The present Sheikh, who I believe is third in succession from the sheikh to whom the pledge was given, is regarded as having a right to compensation now that he has been taxed. The point that troubles us is whether, if we compound with him in perpetuity for a lump sum, he can give us a good discharge binding on his successors. We should want to be sure that if he accepted, say, £10,000 in final settlement and then spent this money on himself, we should be in a position to turn a deaf ear to his successor who would continue to suffer from the Istihlak tax without having derived any benefit from the £10,000. There is also the contingency that the weight of taxation may rise. If there is any question as to whether the Sheikh can give us a good discharge on behalf of his successors, we shall have to consider whether the difficulty can be surmounted by some form of trust deed. This might not be easy, but an arrangement involving an annual vote for ever and ever seems impossible to contemplate. There hasbeen a good deal of discussion of the form in which compensation is to be given - see espe cially3. Laithwaite 1 s letter of the 26th October, 1933, to Helm - but I cannot trace that the particular point I have now raised has ever been considered. If it has not, the question will, we think, have to be put to the lawyers, and this might as well be done at once as nothing can very well happen now to affect their answer. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Clauson at the India Office, Yours sincerely, (SD.)

The actual plot of ground in question is, it is true, ^barren and salty 11 (your paragraph 4) but Colonel tard* s application to the Iraq Grorernment may bring to a head the whole question of the Shaikh's title to the Fao property in which, according to him, the plot is situated, while, as I understand it, it is the policy of His Majesty^ Gorernment to keep this question in abeyance until {Signature) sole / MFP—367 S&amp;r—(M-508)—16-7-35—IQ.OCQ.

(Copies 'by Bag) air, r 1th reference to the correspondence endlrii^ with my telegram Ho. 167 or the 19th June last, i nave the honour to inform you that# in a recent interview, the Xra^i Minister for Foreign Affairs raised once again the question of the position of the chaiklx of a await in regard to civil suits. His Bxcellency complained on the usual lines that at present the Shaikh was able to file civil suits in the Iraqi Courts through powers of attorney given to his agents, but that no actions could be brought against him, as he would not accept service of the necessary legal docurientB. A list of the cases which are said to nave been held up owing to the uncomp romi8 ing attitude of the Shalich has since been forwarded to me by the Director -General of Foreign Affairs and a translation is en- closed herein. 1 2. On January 22nd I replied to Kuri Pasha that 1 iiad studied the embassy files on the subject, but hud founc/ that / no further inforation had been received since the note 1,0.1318 i jj; i. \ * of the 14th June (see : y iespatch Ao* &amp;ou oi ! tiie 15th June) had oeen addressed to the Hinistry of Foreign -affairs, oince, however, it now appeared that the Iraqi tjovemuient desired to puraiie the matter further, I would, as promised in parjigraph 2 of that note, naka enquiries in the competent quarters. 3. 2ou will observe that in tlie last two cases mentioned in the enclosed list, it is not the Jhaikh of Ku ^it himself The Shaikh^s claim to irjmnity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts is made on the ground of his status as an independent who is ouoted ap defendant, but one of his relations. /foreign Uight Honourable Anthony ' Jden, k. 0. , li. p. , etc. ^ e l&gt;c. , etc.- 2 - /O ?• foreign sovereign and cannot, therefore, be extended lio cover his relations* iiocuMents have, in fact, on several occasions during the last few years, been served through the divlouatic channel on various relntions of tJie Shaikh, including i.aryam bint Shaikh Mubarak, and an attempt to serve the actual docu ments involved in the last case mentioned in the enclosed list was resisted by that lady, not on the grounds of any claim to iffiiiRmi ty , but or* the ground that she had received no legacy from her husband. In these circuustunces I would propose, subject to your concurrence, to info rm the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs that there is no question of the iinmunity claiited by the Shaikh being extended to his relations and that His Majesty's Embassy are always prepared to forward legal documents enianating from the Iraqi Courts to the Political /.gent at Kuwait for service on any Kuwaiti except the ruling ohaiidi himself. I am very doubtful of the validity of the reasons for niiich Maryam r ;jfi :sed service of the documents involved in the last case mentioned In the enclosed list and would therefore propose to add that, if the li'aqi Oovermaent are not satisfied wit a her reasons, It is alvmys . n to them to say so and to return the documents to this .''mbaBBy in order that a second attempt to effect service may be made. 5. The remaining six eases mentioned in the enclosed list all concern the ownership of portions of the ahaikh of Kuwait 's date gardens in ira^ and in each of them the Shaikh himself is cited as defendant. 'he p- *sons uuoted aa claimants were all mentioned in Mr. Osilvie-Forbes's letter to the then iiinieter for Foreign /\f fairs Ho. 463 of august 22nd, 1954 (sec his despatch / No. 498 of the sane date) contained in the enclosed , and tho only info-^mat ion of importance list which was not given in I t. Ogilvie- ^ /Forbes 1 a3 - 11 •SWOJ},] ii ■ ■ d W' 1 ' 'J J Fortes s note is that the lady named Bahiyah filed a suit against tne Shaikh in 1933. W'V', Q /*&gt; 6. 'i 'he guest ion of the right of the Suaiidi of Kuwait in international law to refuse to accept service document a which require him to appear as a defendant in the Iraqi Courts has been fully discussed in correspondence /ending with ir John imon 1 s telegram ho. 161 of the l &lt;3€h June, 1935. After carefully studying this correspondence i feel that there can be little doubt that the general rule of international law under which the Jliuikh is entitled to claim ixaiuuni ty froia the jurisdiction of the Iraqi uourts is subject to an exception in connexion with actions relating to the title of a foreign sovereign to real pi^operty owned by him in another country, and tnat the cases now under consideration come within the scope of that exception. 1 understand, too, that the Iraqi Government themselves are well aware of this. un the ground of equity, therefore, I am loth in any further discussions with the Iraqi Government to maintain the attitude that the Shaikh's refusal to accept service of the documents at present under discussion is wholly justified in international law. An attempt to do so would, in my opinion, also be bad policy, since it would almost certainly affect adversely the prospects of pers uading the Iraqi Government to agree to a reasonable settlement of all questions relating to the date gardens in Iraq of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhamiaerah ana might indeed enbarrass my now cordial relations with the Iraqi Government. ?• On the other nand, it is clear that if the Shaikh were now to admit the exception to the general rule and were to accept service of the documents connected with the suits which have been filed against nim, he might as a result be deprived of large portions of his property in Iraq which he would claim, perhaps justifiably, to have been covered by the pledge given /to p—- 4 - to hiia on behalf of His ilajesty's Government in 1914. it would then be necessary to compensate the ohaiich for the loss of such of the property in question as might be round to have been covered toy the pledgee of 1914, ana it would no longer be possible to settle the question of the respective respons— ihilities in this matter of His Majesty's Government and of the Iraqi Government on the lines of the proposals contained in Sir Francis Humphrys's note Bo. 67 of the xtith January, 1935 3)-in (see his despatch Bo. 64 of the 51st January, 19o5; or with CJ-** 7 h ^ ( any modification tliereof which may be decided upon when my despatch Ho# 629 of th^ 23th Hovemlber last has been considered Ufcsf A-'' * by the competent departments of his majesty's Government. In this event X imagine that His Majesty f s Governn»ent would be un willing to accept entire responsibility for compensating the shaikhs, and that if the Iraqi Government were, as I expect, not prepared to accept a part of the responsibility of their own accox*d, would be obliged to asit them to agree to submit the matter to some form of arbitration. Co this course there are obvious objections, and in my opinion it should only be adopted as a last resort. Q* 1 doubt whether the minister for foreign .affairs realizes the full implications, as explained in the preceding paragraphs, of his request that the haikh should agree to accept service of the documents connected with the cases now pending against him, and I feel certain that he and the Iraqi Government as a whole genuinely believe that the Shaikh is taking advantage of the protection afforded to him by His Majesty^ Government to adopt an attitude in the matter which can be justified on grounds neither of equity nor of international law. I venture to suggest, therefore, that X should be authorized to move from the uncompromising position which I and my /predecessorpredeceeeor have previously been instructed to ta^e up in this matter and to explain the position franiOy to the Ira^i Govei'mnent. I should then feel siuch more hopeful of Leing able to enlist their genuine help in an endeavour to finol a satisfactory solution for all the complicated, problems arising out of the ownership by the ohaikhs of Kuwait and Muhamacrah of property in this country and of the pledges in x^espect of this property which were given to the Uhaikns on behalf of His Majesty's Government in 1914. 9. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the honour able the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1 have che honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, ogd ) A rchit&gt;ald Clark Kerr.* • •(38/5/36) british embassy, bagdad.

If, for example, the present oheikh of Koweit were to cede some of his territory, his son, v&lt;--.. when he succeeded to the throne of Koweit, could not claim it 'back again; similarly if the present Gheikh agreed to accept a lump sum payment in final settlement of all claims which he and his heirs might have on His Majesty's Government in respect of their taxation losses, his successors would have no further claim to compensation from us. k.

I m\ sending a copy of this letter to Clauson. Yours sincerely, (3d*) J.G. i f Hale, ;isq.577/18/95) 07/5/36) BRITISH WBKSSY, BAGDAD. 23rd January, 1936. My dear Jack, 4 ■' &amp; As 1 imagined you woula want an early answer to your Chancery letter (S 7158/82/93) of the 8th January and to your despatch Ko.21 (K 73/18 /93) of the 9th January about the Shaikh^ date gardens, I aaked Drower to come and discuss the questions raised in them yesterday. I am afraid the information which he was able to give me was neither definite nor complete enough for incorporation in an official despatch. He has promised to write to Lloyd at once but, as it will probably be some time before an answer comes and as even he may not be very helpful, I will give you in this letter such information as I can. 2. I will take taab rights first. It appears that when a date garden is planted the fellaheen who actually plant the trees acquire ipso facto the right to a small portion of the land planted. This ripjht can only be extinguished by a money payment. The right is, however, a right to the portion of the land in question and not to a certain sum of money, and a plaintiff who won a case on the ground of tg?ab rights would presumably become entitled to the land in respect of which he held such rights. Whether the Shaikh could be said to have been in de facto possession in 1914 of any portion of l^nd in respect of which someone else subsequently established taab rights is a question which I do not feel competent to answer. 5. As regards reclaimed l«nd, Drower does not know how much there is or how many of the gardens are affected; but he/ J.G.Ward, Baa.he is almost certain th^t the Shaikh has not irmde the nece«Bary payment to the Iroqi Governrrient in respect of any part of it and thnt it i^, therefore, all unregistered. I do not think there could be any question of rival claimants to reclaimed land unless in nny p'rticul-&gt;r instance the land adjoining the reclaimed land, though now in de facto possession of the Shaikh, is itself claimed by somebody else. Whether this is the situation with regard to any of the land claimed by the Shaikh I do not know. 4. I am afraid we are becoming increasingly doubtful here about the possibility of persuading the Iraqis to set up e commission with powers as wide as those suggested by Lloyd. Hut we do feel thwt the first step towards a solution is to discover (a) the extent of all the land claimed by the Shaikh, (b) the extent of those portions o^ such l^snd whose ownership by the Shaikh is disputed by anyone for any reason whatsoever, and (c) the exact reason for which the ownership of each portion of disputed land is in doubt. If the Shaikh cannot provide us with this information, the only rneans of discovering it would appear to be to set up a co^ission - even if it is only a commission of enquiry. 5. Drower is asking Lloyd to let him have any information of this kind which is available. However, I very much doubt whether he will be able to help much.

Dear Rendel, Thank you for your letter of the 13th February (S 327/ 18/93). on the subject of the Sh.llch of Koweifs date garders. 2. Constitutionally, I think that any proposal to settle the compensation question without awaiting a comprehensive settlement of the possession question should come to us from the Foreign Office, as the expenditure Involved would be a charge on the Diplomstic «nd Consular Vote. This, however, need not prevent me from explaining why we think: thst the question of compensation should not await a comprehenRive settlement of the possession question or from maKing a suggestion as to how to go nbout the matter. 3. In his note of the 28th January, Humphrys told the Ir *? i aoverm ^nt tha t if they would give the Sheikh a good title to the Paddaghiynh Gardens (less the Bashiyah section) we would contribute up to £S.OOC to expenses; and th^t provided th^t full effect was ^iven to this arrangement, and provided further that the Iraoi Government would (a) claim no arrears from either Sheikh, and (b) give a written assurance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on either Sheikh in future, we would raise no further claim for exemption. 4. ?e h?&gt;ve a very definite impression thnt, while the Iraqi irovernment may in practice be prepared to protect the Sheikhs in possession of their property, e.^. by putting spokes in/ W. Eendel t iSsq. , C.M. G. , Foreign Office.in the wheels of inconvenient litigants, they have not the slightest intention of taking any overt action that might be politically embarrassing to them. If therefore we are to wait for a comprehensive settlement, all open end above board, it looks as if we shall wait indefinitely. If it were possible to keep the Sheikh of Koweit waiting indefinitely for his money, we should h^ve nothing to say; but assuming that sooner or lf*ter we shall hnve to pay him, whether the possession difficulty has been tidied up or not, we had better pay him sooner, for the reason mentioned in my letter of the 17th January. * . it* 5. Clearly we cannot pay him without getting from the Iraqis a formal assurance with regard to provisos (a) and (b) referred to above. We think, however, that the Iraqis might be willing to jTive assurances on these points, since to do so would not involve any overt action th^t mi^ht be mnde the subject of criticism in Iraq. The suggestion we put forward is therefore that the Ambassador might aprain approach the ---—_ .... . Iraqi Government on the following lines. 1 ... - r ^ 6. Referring to the note of the ?Bth January, he might say that it is now evident that a final sdution of the possession question cannot be looked for at an e^rly date. Since the Sheikhs remain in effective possession of their gardens, (apart from the Bashiyah section) and since we know that we can rely on the promise made by King Feisal and solemnly renewed by King Ghazi, delay does not in practice involve any grave consequences so far as possession is concerned. Cn the other hand, settlement of the taxation question does not brook delay, as the Sheikhs are paying annually considerable gums in taxation from which they have been promised exemption. His Majesty's Government are prepared to settle this question, but before doing so they must have formal assurances on points (a) and (b). If they can/can receive such nggur^nce^, they for their p^rt will undertake to r?»i3e no further claim for exemption from taxation. (The actual drafting would of course need fuller consideration: I have not attempted to do more than indicate the line of argument). ks regards the form of conpensation, we should be strongly in favour of settling the Sheikh of Koweit' ^ claim once and for all by g lump sum payment, in return for which we should expect a formal discharge binding on his ouccessors as? well as upon himself. w© do not find it easy to express an opinion as to the lowest amount that would be accepted in final Rettlement, and we should like to he^r the views of those on the spot as to the figure to be offered in the first place. Ko doubt there will have to ba bargaining. B. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Clauson at the India Office. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) E.Hale.53/11 o ^eleprrara G. r;, .C.

Iraq Government * s occupation of ohail:h of - Kuwait's land at Fao» Sir, (ItiSit, •! ■-'/) k . / 3 ^ I have the honour to report that I visited the estates of His Excellency the ohaihh of Kuwai t in Iraq including that at Fao on the 15th and 16th of March* 2. Before leaving Basra I saw Colonel Ward, Director of the Basra Port who informed me that the Iraq Government no?; expected him to be^in work on the Gooly Gamp at ?ao on the land selected by him on the uhaikt^s estate, the right to which the Iraq Government claim. It is said that since my visit some stakes have already been driven into the ground, constituting perhaps 'occupation ?T . I am asking the Shaikh to make sure of this point and inform me in writing. Port officials have certainly been on the ground measuring it up and marking points temporarily, as the Shaikh's agent at ?ao told me* / /-'^ 3^ As you are aware from previous correspondence notably your Express Lett ex 1 ' to Baghdad 10 9-J, dated the 12th February 1936, occupation of the plot in question will open up also the question of the Shaikh's right over a wider area than the plot now required by the Port Director. A reference to the diagram attached will explain the situation of the land to which there are no title deeds although there is a 'sanniya 11 document from the Sublime Porte dated9./ - 2 - r;&gt; A I 9 ,? i' u dated 14 th Ha j air an 1520 for the whole JJao estate* the exact 1 limits of which might be disputed*: i3ee para 4 'of ^rmexure / II to this agency aespatoh iCo»o-a-94 of 15th Novoiiber 1934), 4# Lon^ occupation ~ and in the case of the ITao estate it is about 100 years - is of course a basis of claim but in the case of a patch of land allowed recently to fall into disuse the law, I suppose, mi^ht declare the land forfeit* The shaikh ?muld willingly forgo his claim if it were not that his title to other lands may be prejudiced thereby» 5. The situation is therefore that the occupation of the patch of land will entail in all probability the loss of other land, or if the shaikh defended his rights, brinj to a head the whole question of the ohailch^s title and introduce him into a jungle of legalities* 6. That the law is very involved I have no doubt after talking to Iir.Justice Lloyd at Basra on my return from J'ao. **s I understand, very briefly and avoiding technicalities aid side issues, Mr.Lloyd contends that the proper course foi tke Shaikh is to seek Tapu doeus for the Fao estate on payment of sum equivalent to the value of the land at the time o ? 'irst occupation, the latter in itself a matter leadin : : to argument. Tallin-: this his view is that the Iraq Government without dela^ should begin occupation whereupon the ohaiYn could protest anc. sue the Iraq Government, without however I gather, much chance of success* 7. It mi;;lit be possible to avoid all this if the Iraq Government could be persuaded to postpone occupatior. and order the Tort Director not to proceed with the scheme for a Gooly Gamp on the land in question. 0, This presumably they would only do if they could be convinced that (a) the camp is not essential to the natural progress of the l ? ao Dredging station and (b) that the land is in any case probably not theirs b ut the ohai kh' s.9 • j . b i s p6 , -iiQ,p£ not .op ihg to ss.y v7liq.'fc isj oj* is riotj, essential in the way of improvements at Ifao but it may do no harm to say what I saw there, 10, In the palm gardens outside the Fao Dredging Gamp, there are a number of pise de terre huts of the type common in Iraq, occupied by coolies and others employed by the Port Authorities at ZTao. The huts are spaced out irregularly. This clean little village under the palm trees, I may say, makes a not unpleasing scene. There is a reasonable space, may be a hundrsi and fifty yards, between the residential buildings of the Dredging Camp and the village* 3e4yond the village the palm gardens continue for less than a mile westward and immediately beyond them and where scattered palms and old ditches begin, is the site chosen by Colonel »/ard for the symmetrical Camp to which he wishes to transfer the inhabitants of the mud village for n i iprovement of health' 1 . That enthusiasm for accomplishraent and improvement -6 should lead to this move, I can well understand but that it is essential from any point of view, I should doubt without more evidence than my eyes gave me on the 16th Llarch* Therefore I do not think that it can be reasonably contended that delay in the building, of the Gooly Gamp would be a spoke in the wheel of Iraq T s progress* 11, Secondly with regard to the evidence that the _ , . , Shaikh could produce to show that the land is his and that he would have grounds for contesting occupation, I found on enquiring locally that there is evidence to be had from numerous survivors that Bund ,, ^ fr (See diagram) was built by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, although it my have been repaired, and its alignment slightly altered (although not opposite the plot now in question) during the British Occupation and more recently during the Laimakamate of one Hajji Ahmad at SIBA. In this connection the Degree Sheets15./ - 4 ~ ^ ^ W ^ Sheets {1910} may be studied. They seem to prove that the bund existed then, although Colonel V/ard informs me that he heard of its being built about 1915 and was therefore sure that it was then that it was made# another map to be studied which shows clearly the palm garden with various half cultivated patches Jast of it is Degree sheets Mesopotamia, 2 miles to 1 inch - Kuwait (Sheet No.2) , published by G-overnment of India Survey D epa r tme nt, 1917 issue. / 7 Cl There is no second bund (oee para 3 of Ambassador, Baghdad's despatch I.'o.o3/l2/o6 of the 6th January 1956} and I failed to hear of any local opinion to confirm the statement therein quoted although I asked the Port Directorate's representative with me and Mr.Coaster of Fao if they could not produce it, ouch local people as we encountered and questioned {^ave their opinion forcibly the other way. (The Mudir of l ? ao has, I believe, never been asked his opinion by the Iraq Government or the Port authorities). 12. Jlast of the bund old ditches show where there were attempts at palm cultivation since abandoned owin^ to the saltiness of the ground and the attraction of labour away to the Port Camp. To isiorth and South of the patch in question palms stunted by salt have survived and there is no plainly defined limit to the cultivated area. Certain cultivators still possess letters of authority granted to their fathers from Shaikh Mubarak giving them the right to exploit this land and these letters could be produced, 13. Shaikh Mubarak from this evidence was therefore indisputably in effective occupation of the land in question anc built the bund ( a ) . 14. iSven the Port Representative at Fao, Mr.Coaster, admitted to me inferentially that he now acknowledged the Shaikh's ri : :ht to the land and hoped, to use his words, that he rt would not be jockeyed out of it ff .5 llfi 15 It therefore seems to me that we have reasonably good grounds for saying that it is believed that the Iraq Government would not be enduring any hardships by postponement of the Cooly Gang? scheme and that the land, could the case be argued in a Court of Law, might be found to be the Shaikh* s; and that being so ask for postponement of action by the Port on the grounds that not only the Shaildi will be involved but the British Government too - should the case go against him. 16• x^s a reserve position upon which we could fall back there is the fact that the shaikh is willing (I have his verbal assurances only and shall not ask him for written ones unless you instruct me) that he would either give, or let at a peppercorn rent the patch of land reauired by the Fort Directorate, if this would sdve the difficulty.

You will already have seen the Political Resident's Express Letter of 31st January, Nc.60-S of 1936, a copy of which was forwarded to the Foreign Office under India Office printed letter of 18th February, No.P.Z.1141/36, in which Colonel Powle commented on Sir A.Clark Kerr's proposal.

But ¥;hen you and the Treasury have considered Powle's points in regard to which the Embassy may have more to say, we can, if the proposal is to 'be pursued, hold the departmental meeting foreshadowed in your letter under reference and discuss it in detail. 3. It seems to us, meanwhile, that the most urgent matter is to take the necessary action for a settlement &gt; of the question of the Sheikh's compensation for the loss of his exemption from taxation and that the 'best method of approaching this question is the one suggested 'by Hale in his letter to you of 24th February 1936. We agree with him as to the desirability of separating the compensation question from the possession question and oi settling: the former as soon as possible. If we could obtain assurances from the Iraq Government not to claim i V) arrears of taxes from the Sheikh and not to impose discriminatory taxation upon him, and if we then proceed to honour our financial obligations by refunding to the sheikh the equivalent of what he has already paid in taxation and by making a lump sum payment as a iinancial discharge of the promised/3. promised exemption from taxation, we should at any rate have accomplished a good deal# and should have disposed of the most urgent aspect of the whole matter. We could then pursue with the IraQi Government a settlement of the question oi the Sheikhs possession, pending which we might 'be able to regard with comparative equanimity a continuance of the present status quo in regard to the possession asx3ect, which, as Hale points out, is not so urgent so long as the Sheikh remains in de facto possession. 4. You may 'be proposing to call an interdepartmental meeting soon to consider Hale's suggestions: if so we shall 'be glad to attend. Meanwhile we think it would he well to consult Powle, and if you see no objection I propose to telegraph to him personally on the lines of the enclosed • ' r draft. 'r - 5. When we come to discuss figures, we ought perhaps to take some account also of the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who has 'been out of the picture lately. I see it was suggested in Bagdad despatch No.390 of the 12th July 1934, that he should get half what the Sheikh of Koweit get?- in the way of compensation. But the urgent matter seems to be/4. 'be to settle the -ruestion of the Sheikh of Koweit's compensation (as I suppose it is doubtful whether there are in any case practicable means of enabling the Sheikh of Mohammerah to enjoy the income of his property or the benefit of any compensation?). 6.

No. J* iV490* Baghdad, 12th April, 1956. 1 My dear Bateman, JiOlt has asked me to give you my views on the subject of settling the affairs of the Sheikh of Kowait a sj ecial Commission. In order to fulfil the following promise, given to the Sheikh in 1914 'Your gardens which are now in your possession, that is to say, your date gardens situated between. Kao and Qurnah, shall remain in your possession and the possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue and taxes', it must first be ascertained what lands are covered by the - promise and then the Sheikh must be vested with an unassailable title. J) . {?-) The first part of the business need not have anything to do with the grant or correction of title deeds. It in volves only an administrative enquiry into an area, fixing its extent and the recording of such claims to title as luay be made* a survey is necessary and it would appear natural for the Sheikh to have it made, first of all, so that he can present to the investigating authority a map for it to work on, showing exactly what he claims to be included in the promise; but 1 do not know whether the Sheikh would be willing or able to do it, or to pay for it, or whether the Surveyors, acting unofficially, would be allowed to work in peace. The last point has been suggested by llogg who considers that, if anything is to be accomplished, the Burveyors would have to work under the direction and protection of the Authority charged with making the enquiry. That Authority may well be a Commission /and.and, in view of the nature of its work, it would appear eminently reaaonaTole for the aheikh to be represented on It; I ®ee no reason why the Iraqi Govermaent should reject such a proposal. i(r ' C)nc e th e area i8 ascertained, the Bheikh must be granted a clean title. This would involve the passing of legislation to juctify the barring of claims against the title and, presumably, providing for compensation in suitable cases. Whether Parliament should, before the enquiry begins, confer on the Coiiimission s povrer to order the registration and assess and award compensation, or whether Parliament should wait until the preliminary enquiry hae finished before granting the title or authorising the Commission to grant it, is a matter for discussion. To give the Conmission power to pass decisioni3 as to title and compensation with all the force of unappealable judgments of the courts appears to involve difficulties. For one thing, the decisions may be dis pleasing to the Sheikh and the British (iovemment. For an other, it would be difficult to ask the Iraqi Government to confer on a mixed Commission the power to award compensation up to unknown amounts. It appears to be better for the two Governments to decide wiiat is to be done after the exact area has been agreed upon and tne amount of compensation lias been ascertained. If the latter course is adopted there will be no necessity for legislation to set up the Commission (because its decisions will not be of a Judicial nature so as to affect any public or private rights) but if it cannot get on with its work without the power to enforce the attendance ot wit nesses soiiie law governing procedure would be needed. {i I have spoken of compensation in suitable cases# I have no knowledge of any claims that would require to be Dai* red by legislation except the ^rights of the judgment holder in ill# Bashiya case and the pending action regarding the Faddaghia /Estate.mm 3 /0 Estate. I am only supposing that other claims may be found to exist. Youro Ginccrely, (Signed) K.M. DROWER, p. ii. I would recall that survey and assessment, of a preliminary nature, were done in the case of the Railway#* A mixed Gommiseion (mizod in that it included a represent ative of the Railways) produced a report on the land occupied by the liailways for the purpose of enabling the British and the Iraqi Governments to consider what should be done next about paying for it. The work of the Commission gave a clear idea of the problem to be faced. It was co clear, in fact, that it was distasteful to both trovernments, but that is another story.

I ^ With reference to Foreign Office letter S 4 &lt;M9/82/95 of the 9th July. 1935, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you? to be X&amp;id before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty* b Ambassador at Bagdad regarding the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit and riieisioers of his faftiily to claiM isKsunity from civil suits brought against them in the Iraqi Courts. 2. The Secretary of State has given careful consideration to the arguments advanced in Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr 's despatch, as well as to the question of the best tacties to be adopted in negotiating with the Iraqi Government on the subject. The line which Mr. Eden would propose to instruct the Ambassador to take in discussion with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs is set out in the accompanying draft of a despatch to Sir Archibald Ciark~Kerr f and I am to request that he nay be furnished with any observations upon its terms which Lord Zetland may desire to offer. 5. Mr. Men considers that there would be advantage in keeping this aspect of the dispute concerning the lands owned by the Sheikh of Koweit as far as possible distinct from the main problems of securing for the Sheikh a firm title to his lands and assessing the amount of compensation due to him in respect of Iraqi taxation. He would accordingly propose, subject to the concurrence/ e Under-Secretary of State, India Office.concurre c@ of ^ord Zetland, that the question of the instructions to be given to Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr in ^ k * Wb reply to his despot en of the 3th February should be pursued without waiting for the interdepartmental meeting which it is intended to call shortly t j diucuss the policy of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in regard to the two main issued referred to above. 4* A similar letter is being sent to the Treasury.

The aerite of the aaae are/are entirely ft meiter for decision by the Iraqi Courts. 3. In view of thee© eoneiderationB I concur in your excellency's taking action with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Att&amp;i rs on the line© recommendted in paragraph 4 of your I despatch of the Sth February. 4. The question of suits brought against yx-- the Bheikh of rowel t himself in respect of v lands in his possession in Iraq has been re -exaained in the light &gt;i a the arguments developed in paragraphs 6 to 8 of your despatch. I em advised that, as you yourself auggest f it fould not b« worth attempting to argue that the Iraqi courts are not entitled to entertain actions relsting to lend in Iraq when the defendant la a foreign sovereign. It is not possible to deny that, in oases where title to real property is Involved f International i^aw admits an exception to the general rule conferring upon sovereigns : iuaunity from process in foreign courts* and •#JW ' .. •.. . Hi*/6./ His i*jetty's Gawxmiaent are therefore n i o position to continue to base their refusal to transmit docu/amte for service on the Sheikh in «ueh cases on the siaple ground that he is a foreign sovereign. 5. in all the eircu&amp;stances I agree that s fr^nk: explanation to the Iraqi Oovemiaent of the legal position ©e set out In the preceding pars'graph can no longer be avoided, although I am inclined to doubt whether this development will in feet inauce the Iraqi Gove nmsnt to execute the proisises which they have given in the past and lend their genuine assistance to the endeavour to find a solution of the problems connected ^ith the property possessed in Iraq by the sheikhs of owe it and oha sine rah# The tactics to be pursued with the Iraqi 0overnaent once the defence of iiaaunity hes been abandoned are no easy matter, but after careful coneideratier I consider that it will be best for your Excellency to adopt the following line of argument.r 6* Yrm should explain that the suite brought against the shei'th of Koweit in re&amp;pect of his Iraqi real property would normally have oome within the scope of the exception admitted toy InterTiatioaal aw to the general rule of the iasmmity from process of foreign sorereigns, and His Majesty* a aovenment would normally have been prepared to tramanit the relevant documentb for service on the ehei th. Nev rtheless, 111© Majesty 's Gov rment consider that in the special circumctances surrounding these cases they are under no obligation to asslat in the service of documents on Hi© Excellency. In their view the Iraqi Govemmmt ^hare their responsibility for safeguarding the Sheikh f ® possession and owiership of these date m*&amp;mm in and Hie Majeety 1 « OoveFnMnt are naturally matole to take any aetion which would iaipiy their idmisaion of the right of the Iraqi Government to acquiesce in their subjects ehailenglng that 'OEseesion and ownership in the Courts. His Majesty^/«.3e.ty'. Oovemiftent mu.t continue to maintain their view thet the Iraqi Oovenwent a r» under a let'iaite international obligation not to allow act! ins to proceed agninet the ghf ilch in respect of real property in Iraq. Apart from this consideration the Iraqi Government should appreciate that .His majesty's aovemaent oould not in any case xrT... • -VjK'rS 1 ^- ^ v.'.,, . ... . ^be1st the service of docmaents on the Sheifch in connexion with these cases, aince to do so would ele rly be inconssifctent with their own obligations unler the leoi^e given to the Sheikh in 1914 in regard to his land© in Iraq,. S. After you have spofeen in the sense of the t^o preceding paragraphs, I con&amp;iaer that there will be advantage in your developing the argument foreshadowed in paragraph 8 of your despatch under reply. Your Excellency could point out that, if His Majesty's Governmeat ^ere to take a different line and to agree to transmit docuiaents for service on the Sheikh of &gt;'oweit t the result would probably be a flood of acti jrs against the sheikh. fais might well prove highly embarrassing to the Iraqi aovemment. 9/9. in the first place the Iraqi Cw Ooverament , apart fro^a the reisponeibilities unter the 1914 pledge to the Sheikh, which $ I am aware that they refuse to adbsit, are definitely toouad by yarioua unlfirtakinga giiren on their hehalf to settle the question of the sheikh*e title to his landa. If claimants are permitted without hindrance to bring actions against the cheikh the Iraqi Government will find it difficult, if not impossible, to fulfil their undertaicings. 10. A further consideration of which the Iraqi Ooverniaent aight be reainded is that# if actions against the Sheikh were freely H' permitted and some of them proved auecesaful# it would be necessary under the 1914 pledge to indeamify the Sheikh in respect of the amount *- i- of his losses. His majesty's Governiaent hold the Iraqi Oovermaent responsible for the execution of the 1914 pledge, and the result would be only to enlarge the amount of compensation which His Majesty's aovernmcnt would feel obliged to claim from them, end —J I * I 8 O0nft6(|uently to itioraathe: suie at stake if the olela nad to be submitted to arbitration# 11* ■* '.&amp; conclusion suggested 'by th© above considcratians is that the Iraqi Government would be w«ll advised in their own interest to welcome any factor which reeulted in holding up actions brought again®t the sheikh of ■1 - Koweit in respect of hlB Iraqi lands, instead ■; c. •'-&gt;:, of complaining because His Majesty^ Government art; not assisting the service of documents upon him* The fact that the I Iraqi Ocveriuieat should make them complaints can only be interpreted by His Majesty*s Ooverruient as evidence that, in spite of the promises mede by King Faisal and repeated since his death. the Iraqi Government are not making any serious attempt to secure a set-lament of this long- standing and troublesome question. , ^ t ' r -r I : IH ■ ■ i - \ m■E ■ L- r. 1 IfffilA OPPIOE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 21st April, 1936. 2570/36. • ( '6 S Sir- I am directed 'by the Secretary of State for India to refer to Foreign Office letter of 9th April?

Although we do not dissent from your draft despatch to Bagdad, which seems to us in general to take the right line, we should he grateful if you could advise us further on one aspect of the matter. 2. Hitherto His Majesty's Government have 'been refusing to serve processes on the Sheikh of Koweit on the ground that the Sheikh is a sovereign and therefore entitled to claim immunity from suits in the Iraqi Courts. Under your present proposal we shall in future still refuse to serve processes on the Sheikh, 'but for a different reason, i.e. not on the ground of his sovereign rights 'but 'because it would 'be contrary to the interests Tooth of the Iraqi Government and His Majesty's Government and would 'be contrary to the pledges which have been given to the/ Rendel, Esq., C.M.G. , foreign Office, S,?. 1,2. 17 the Sheikh. • oO fcliP 0.3 W0 OSTI o o+w -c can 0 ee, the practical position will thus he the same as before, even m the event of the iragi Government not reacting favourably to Clark Kerr's demarche - i.e. it will not in -po~+ t. .- l - li not m fact be possible for the Sheikh to he sued in the Iraqi Courts because we shall he refusing to serve a process, and he cannot he sued until the process is served.

(There is oi couxse me possibility that the Irakis might intercept tne Sheikh one day when he was passing through Iraq and serve the processes on him personally. But perhaps that is hardly likely. 1 ) It seems a pity that we should have to abandon our straightforward position that the Sheikh is a sovereign and therefore cannot be sued, but if the lawyers say that is wrong and if the Iraqi Government know perfectly well that it jjs wrong, it certainly seems futile to stick to it.

The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ.In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.The correspondence discusses in detail a number of cases in the Iraqi courts regarding the land owned by Shaikh Aḥmad and the attempts made by British officials in Iraq and Kuwait to mediate between the two sides. In the correspondence, British officials discuss whether or not the British Government should compensate Shaikh Aḥmad for the amount of tax he had been forced to pay on his exports from Iraq since his dispute with the Government of Iraq had begun.The file contains a letter from Shaikh Aḥmad's lawyer, Jacob Gabriel that outlines in detail his activities in 1933 and correspondence that shows that after doubting Gabriel's honesty, Shaikh Ahmad subsequently removed his power of attorney and granted it to one of his sons, Shaikh Mohamed Al Sabah [Muḥammad Āl Ṣabāḥ].On folio 150a the file contains a diagram drawn by the British Political Agent in Kuwait, Gerald Simpson DeGaury.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
