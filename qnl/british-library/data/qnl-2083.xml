Shrimps and crabs were common a^ong th rocks between Maskat and Matrah| while at Sib, the shore was alive with crabs of all sizes. What a coast for a boyI These pale crabs sit, or rather stand, n the shallow water, with their long, stalked ayes projecting into t&gt;ie air. Then a wave knocks them over, and they get grit into their eyes, they ciean them again by means of two of their appendages. To see a crowd of these c crabs raising and lowering their eyes, one might imagine one was looking at a uattalion doing am exercises, ^rms, above the head---Raise1 1 When alarmed, ana the crabs afe on the shore, they run along the sand with surprising swiftness} but in the water their progress is slow. Hermit crabs are ccmiion also, and are the funniest sight. Some §f the shells they use are more or less rounded; but others are of more fantastic shape, with one long process and many lesser ones. Brighton beech is uninteresting; all the shells lie inert as stones. Here, a shell, at which one might have been idly gazing, suddenly gives a Jerk, like a heavy lorry getting into bottom gear, and then starts off, trailing complicated trQ.cks behind it in the sand. It might be a soldier crawling along under an enormous pack, and with the rifle barrel pointing o^er the shoulder. What do crabs eat? One was discovered browsing on a date stone. The local i-ame for crab is SHAKDJJS* JAKA.OARI is not understood. The flesh is not eaten. Moluses. Cuttle fish must be common ? since their bones litter the rocks near Matrah.

Donkeys are the commonest transport a- imals. Ihey are small and grey, sometimes like the camels, almost a gazells buff.

It is the first crop to Tar cultiyated| the others with the possible exception of wheat and barley, follow and profit by the palms 1 shade. Colonel Miles gives the following tribes as cultivators of dates:- Bani Ali, -bani J3u All, Bani Battash, A1 Habus, A1 fegriyina and A1 Ibriyin. ^ore often than not, the date gardens are the property of absentee landlords. In the oases, they are generally not far absent, since most of them live in kac the villages whcih form the oases centres. In winter, here also the cultivators live; though in summer they remain in the gardens. Many of the owiiers of JBatanah date gardens live in Masqat o^ Matrah or in other of the larger coast to¥»ns. A bi^; landlord is called HAK-AHI. UALkK is not understood, but RAI , AL MAL, is frequently spoken of,. The actual cultivation, ^hen not carried out by the peasant proprietor, BARBHUL, pi. BARADHIL, a word also meaning'a lazy fellow 1 , is in the hands of a paid laborer, the BIDAR, corresponding with the PALAH of the Iraq, enjoying less security of tenure that that pro vided by the TAABAi tenancy of that country, or the MAUHISI of the Punjab. In the Wadi Samayil, every BIDAR receives, at date harvest, one bunch of dates from each palm, irrespective of of the number of bunches borne. In the Batanah, on the other toe hand, he never receives dates, but nearly always money, sometimes, miney with food, or with food and clothes. In both districts, fruit other than dates is the exclusive property of the garden owner * There must be an immense amount of pilfering, however. Pal-en fruit is the tenant's right. The provision of offshoots, fruit trees, and irrigating cattle, and the food of the latter.is. on the owner. Lucerne seed and that of wheat and barley are also provided by the owner, who takes four-fifths of the crop from the former and nine-tenthsof the crop of the two latter. Millet is usually growa on the same terrms as lucerne but not invariably so. Truck and minor crops are sown with the tenants seed, and are his own property. The amount in cash which a BatanahBIHAR receives, in the cases where no fiood and clothes are received, is a^out five JfclAiAT a month. This was the commonest figure given in reply to questions; but an old man at Ml Hii said he got 50 RIA-^ a year; and two younger fellows with him said they each got 40 filAL. A garden, near Rumais, was looked after by a small boy and a „ oung mans the former got f Rial a month, plus food, and the latter 2^ RIAiAT plus food. Kadhim, a merry and well-spoken, half-negro half-Arab lad, work ing in the garden of Saiyid Muhammad, got 4 RIALAf a month in addition to food and clothing; but he seemed to be a fovourite with the old man# Pood is generally reckoned as being worth -it RIAL a week. If then the average wage for a Batanah BIDAR be only 60 RIA -u a year, as the other emoliments are the same as those of the wadi Samayili it might be supposed that oO RLA l. is the value of one bunch of dates from every palm in the average holding of a Sagiayil BIDAR. If one bunch per palm be equivalent with one-eight of the crop, the total crep would br wotth, on this basis, 480 RIAL. With dates at 50 RIAL a BAHAii, the tdal production would be a little less than 10 BA.HAR, or 16 ,320 lb. This amount of dates might be produced on 165 palms, or about three acres of garden. Actually, all the Batanah tenants appear to prefer to be paid as in the ^amayil, so it may be presumed that the rate of pay is higher there, and that the area of a Samayil holding is greater than suggested above. That this pre- sumptionis probably correct is boxrne out by other, rough ob servations, which indicate that the Samayil holding is nearer 4 or 5 acres than 3. In the Batanah, however the area is nearer 2. In the latter district, the tenant has to raise all the irrigation water from wellss In the former, the water is aJbmostalmost entirely provided by flowing springs; andf consequently , the cultivator can manage a greater area. In a bad year, the Samayil cultivator stands to lose. Probably here is the explana tion of the high wage rate compared with the lower, but fixed and certain, wage rate in the Batanah. t Furthers the wage rate in both districts is fixed by long custom; the drought must have caused the prices of agricultural produce, including dates, to rise. Hence, a cultivator paid in king would by likely to be, temporarily at least, setter offthan one receiving a money wage. Cultivation and Implements. The soil of the whole area is light sand. There is no clat, though Palgrave mentions the existence of a single bed of pottery clay near the coast not far from ^-atrah, Drainage is excellent, and there is no alkali landf if the slight amount on the xsir&amp;a surface of the sea-shore be excepted. There is nowhere a rank growth of weeds and cultivation is of the scantiest and shallowest. One who is used to an€- English s^ade smiles at the MISEAH of the Iraq, ^e would laugh loud and long at the similarly named implement of 0man. It indeed resembles more a weed-stuober that a spade. PLATIu XXV.TIL. MI SI .AH Held by a Bata^ah Cultivator. There is no hard clay to be turned over, no sodden, bsu-ed, iron-bound land to be broken up, nor are any deep channels to be dug out. The chief use of the spade is to dam up the tiny, water courses, in turn, as each bed by irrigated. The plough,HISS3t, JFABBAN ^ot understood, tis also absurdly small and light, and made of wood iron tipped. It is drawn by one cow or bull. If ploughing be by contract, ana there be l)ut a small piece of land to |)e ploughed, containing onj.y a few palms, the usual rate is 5 PAI aK palm, the piough, plough ' animal, and labour being all provided by the contractor. This rate is equivalent to about a RIAL for an acre. Generally, however, if much land is to be i)loughed, a bargain is struck for the whole piece. The third implement is the HIQ^AGS, which is similar to the long kiii^ of MIHASHLH or m IMJAL of the Iraq; that is, it is long, only slightly curved, toothed sickle, used in the Iraq onj.y for pruning palms, but, in Uman, also for cutting fodder, a labour reserved, in the Iraq, for the smaller, nore curved MI&amp;JAL. MIi^ASS is 'scissors 1 in the Iraq. A HIB, a long chisel for separating offshoots from their parents, completes the list of agricultural implements. The Tawi. In the Wadi Samauil, the size of a man f s holding is computed from the numper of palms it contains. The units of area, PIDBAH, MASHAHAH, QUHALAH, JARIB, or DAUmt, appear unknown. In che Bataaah, however, the garden unit is the TAwI, pi. TAWXAJi, so called presumably in^ reference to the stone built well. This is the amont of date garden watered by one single or douoXe, watey-hoist. Three of these, at Sib, belonging to Shaikh Hashid, were surveyed, with the following result:- Bearing Offshoots Fruit Total Total Approx. Palms trees Palms Palms o.

Hence the incidence of date palms might 'be expected to be low, rn a walk from Sib towaeds Rumais, the numbers of bearing palms in various TAWIAi* along the road were counted roughly* They were as follows D* Double Hoist 500 bearing palms E. Single 200 do F* do 150 ' do G. Double 300 do H. Single 175 do I. do 100 do J'. do 4 do iC. do 60 do L. do 60 do M« Double 400 do Average 135 Reckoning D^G and M as two each). Saiyid Saifm the Wall of Sib, considered the a average n mber of palms in a sinle hoist TAtfl as 200. But this seems aJi over-estimate. A figure nearer 100 would seem more lively, with the average number of acres in the TAWI as two and the average spacing of palms 30 feet each way. The same informant considered that the irrigation of the TAWI cost the owner 100 RIAL a year, 60 for the BIDAH and 40 for the bull; but most people considered the bull as expensive as the man. Keckaming that it costs 120 RIAL a year to water and look after 100 bearing palms, and reckdning the yield per Bataixak palm as 75 lb., then the cost of producing dates, without any charge for supervision, interest on capital or for taxes, works out as 0.95 cents a pound. One tenth of the gross crop is supposed to be rendered as government tax. The net return of each palm to the grower thus becomes 67,5 lb., so the cost of producing datesm without reckoning anything for in terest on capital or for supervision, oecomes 1.50 cents a pound If the average price of dates is the Batanah gardens ftot during the season be 40 RIAL a BAHAR, the price per pound is 1.4 cents, allowing 0,34 cents between the cost and the selling price of a pound. Young, mature palms of good varieties, well bearing, cost nothing up to 100 RIAL each? so perhaps a fair average price for a TAWI might be 5,000 RIAL. 60 counting nothing for supervision, the interest on invested capitax in a Batanah date garden may be about 0.86/^ or 25 50/ j per TAWI per annum from dates. Auxilliary crops add to this return. As noted later lucerne can be profitable. Fruit bringsin something, though prices are low, Mangoes at Sib were selling at 250 for a RIAL last June, Limes were selling at about the same price in the Wadi Samayil at the same time. The water hoist used to irrigate the TA.»I is of th ordinary Arabian type. The water is about 20 feet below the ground level from A1 Hil to Rumais; so probably may be at this depth all along the Batanah. The vertical, supproting hoists are usually made of palm logs sawn longitudinally in two. They are strong and smooth. In other date producing countries the pa-an logs a e t- e worst of te building wood, for the reason that the internal fibres are loose and tear out. To plane such a log is like trying to plane a bath lufah. The water is dropped from the buc-et on to a masonry collecting trough, and thence ledthence led thru a subsidiary, 'bathing tanlc, into the main, storage tanli. Here it remains, until the BIDAR has finished hoisting. He then unplugs a vent in the tank, and occupies himself in distribu ting the water. He is drawing water from before t e palest streak of dawn to sunrise, and from ear^y afternoon to sun-set. Perhaps he and his 'bull work about seven hours a day at this labcut. In ail the Batanah, there must be 15,000 and more men and animals jfeo employed, year in year out. PLATL XXVI, A water-Hoist at Sifalah, To western ideas? the wastage of man and animal power is appai-ing.

Being relieved of the labour of having to raise the water, he/ could spend his time improving the cultivation of the land, and in growing cotton, ground-nuts, sesamum, and other profitable ground crops, 'instead of leaving the land nearly bare, as now. But, of course such a scheme wilx uot materialise under the ge present reg ime. Sven in the capital, Maskat, a town pos essing a climate considered by most visitors to be more unpleasant in summer than t that of any other town in the lear or ^ar east, there are no electric lights, fans, or ice machines. Howevef, ?/ at ic feasible in the Batanah is the installation of either small oil engines and pumps or else mills. There is a sea breeze by day, and a land breeze by night. The wells and. tanks are already installed. The size of the TAWI is not too big for a ¥/ind-mill to irrigate. Whatever mechanical means were employed to raise the water, the stumbling block would by the capital ex penditure required. However, if some windmill firm were to estab lish itself in the Batax.ah, and would be patient in collecting the the instalments on its plants,probably people could be induced to b J buy. Windmills are used for irrigating small area date gardens in Shai--h Uthman, near Ad n in various places in Algeria, and have been intrdduced recently into Bahrein and Amarah in the Iraq. How ever, formers do not change their ways, unless compelled by econo mic/ pressure. And not always then, nevertheless, if the iik bigger landlords could be brought to see that their irrigation is now costing them tentimes what it could cost them, they might make the change. The Argentine is buying windmills at the rate of 16,000 annually. » One double water-hoist raised the level of the water in a tank, 20 feet by 24 feet, one and a half inches in hald and hour. One single water-hoist may be expected therefore to raise 375 gallons of water an hour. A half-inch, centrifugal pump, driven by a motor of one-third horsepower would raise as much.Palms are ?/atered twice a week in the Batanah# Thus, in a week, each palm receives, reckoning no loss by seepage and evaporati n in the channels, about 150 gallons of water. Were water easier to come by, the palms would probably receive more; and an increase in yield, com, arable with that of palms in the Wadi Samayil, might result. The TAWI is usually fenced round with thorns and euphorbia (?) bushes, SHAME. Sometimes, a railing is made of palm.s trunks at 20 feet intervals, rather reminiscent of English split chestmut fencing. To axlow a passage to pedestrians, out to k ; keep out cattle, s rough gate in the fence is often made of three cross poles and two uprights; and, once, in a bosky glade, where the acacias,(they might have been May bushesl), hid the palms, a stile was enccunterdd.l£L I rrj. gation^ yiae water-hoist, ZIGRAHi as it is tlie heart, provi ding the lige olood, of the TA.*I, ha,s been described already* Throughout the Batanah, is heard the plaintive shriening of the pullies. To a suggestion that the exiis might be oild, the reply eame that the nMsy wheel was better, AHZAIH. Major Cheesman had the same repl^ in HufHuf, Some of the gardens at Sib were located in the dry beds of the torrents. To provide for the rare occasions, when these are flooded, masonry dams are built across the stream beds, thru the gardens. The velocity of the water is Urns diminished, and the water, instead of rushin to the sea, is held up and sinks a± into the ground, irrigating the land, and fcugmenting the sub-soil water. Ifi the Wadi Samayil, and in the other widyan seen in the interior, with the exception of a little water provided by water-hoists to the drier parts of the oases, all the irrigation water is from springs. The water from these springs would sdcCKK flo .v under ground, and never be seen, were it not that underground channels have /een contructed, with gradients less than those of the wadi beds above them. At a distance from the springs, varying its depthiv ad with the relative slopes of the channel and the wadi, the water is brought to the surface, At this point, the oasis begins, and continues, until there is left no more water to irrigate the palms, ^uch an artificial, underground, water course is called PAIAG. In Morocco, such a. one is called FUGAHAJim in Persia, C^AifAT. Wells are first sunk in line, at intervals varying from ten to thirty feet, and then the connections are established between them. The labout of constru cting these channels, with a crow-bar as the onxy implement, is considerable. The interior of the chanxxel is cemeated with a mixture of lime and plaster of Paris. Soxae fo the channels date from remote times probably; but new ones continue to be made. It may be that the channels are more numerous now than formerly; out it is more probable that the new ones do no more than take the place of old ones dried up or filled in. In a PAXAG- under construction at Misfah al Aliyah, a w^ll, about 20 feet deep, had been sunk by four men in six days. The main channel of a big spring, where it issues from the ground, may be two feet wide and two fieet deep. Such channels were half full in June. Small effluents are constructed and the ultimate branches in the gardens are no more than six inches wide and four inches deep. The slpe of these smallest distrubutaries.is reckoned as three fingers a hundred cubits, or rather more than I in 1000. The surface channels are constructed of the same sort of cement as those beneath the ground, that is mxxK of a mixture of lime and plaster of Paris. A rou^h founda tion is first made of cemented pebbles. The lime is prepared by burning the rounded, limestoaes pebbles, which abound on the surface and just under the surf: cr of the wadi bed and in the conglomerate of the hills. The plaster of Paris is prepared by burning a reddish earth, which is widespread, after this has been puddled with water and dried in the sun in cakes. Such a profusion of calciam sulfat in the soli must be particularly beneficiant to agriculture, in that it neutralises the toxicity of much of the harmful KkEi chloride of the alkali petals. It is certainly a fact that date palms ^ever seem to do so well, as in well drained districts,where the water is plentiful, and where the soil is riuch in gypsum, given of course, the climatic conditions are suitable. In Algeria, in the Wadi b uf, ar, as the Prenchprefer, to call it, the Oued Soud, calciam sulfat and water ate as'plentiful as in the Wadi Samayil, ana drainage is as good; and the date palms a e perhaps the only ones in the world, which approach in vigor those of the Sama il. Gypsum is known as SARUQ, JUS, of. the Italian Sesso. is not understood, nor is the Persian Gach . ^ ^HQ rnmmmmm • Water rights are inherent in the property rights. The price of a garden is always inclusive of that amount of water to which it is entitled by custom. The customayy rotation of water to the gardens is exactly adfiered tp, a-d disputes, which are rare, are refered to the shaiiih for decision. Some gardens are watered as often as every four days, but the interval varies up to amaximum of eighteen days. In the gardens, which get such infrequent water ings, pits are commonly dug round the palms, so that the greatest amount of water may be obtained at eack watering, as is done injfek the drier gardens of the Algerian -^iban. mT-^S AKD DATS % Distirnbuti on and Incidence. • The oases of Oman are scattered along the oeds of the water courses. Water, as noted above,is supplied from underground channels, leading from sources, higher up in the bed of the wadi. How many oases there are in all 0man is difficult to conjecture. Prom the mouth of the Wadi Samayil, at Sib, as far as. and inclu ding, Hub, a distance of about 40 miles, there are about 20 oases if the big group of palms at ^amayil be considered as one. The smallest ones, e.g. Miltaqah al Hadariyah, probably contain no/ more than about 800 palms; but the £&gt;amayil group probably contains over 100 ,000 palms; iOiaudh, Pinjah, Bidbid, and Sarur pro^a-ly conta- n something xiice 20,000 palms eack. The remaining twelve oases may be put down, at a guess, at an average of 5,000 palms each. The total palms in the valley, as far as, and including. Hub, therefore, may ^e estimated roujily as about 240,000. Por purpose of comparism, it may be mentioned that the number of date palms, on the Iraqi p:orticn of the ban^s of the Shatt al Arah is about .,000 ,000. How many date palms there are ,between Hub and the Gabal Aichdhar is not icnown. It is proba-fcLe that they are less than below Hub. But the Wadi Samayil, though it is certainly the richest in palms of any of the Oman widyan, yet it is only one of about forty such, lying between Has Masandam and Has al Hadd; and most of those probably contain some palms. It is hazardous ansi: to conjecture what is the total palmjmpxiatidosM population of Oman, excluding the coast, out 1 ,000,000 is a more or less intelligent guess. If the coastal region be included the number of palms might amount to 2,500,000 for date palms jrow along the Batanah in a continuous belt from Al Hil to Suhar® Only the first twelve miles of this belt, be ginning at Al Hil, were seen; but several and reliable inforaacta - mantsstate that this portion is typical of the whole. The average width of the palm belt was generally put down at a mile. To allow for pardonable local pride, halfi a mile has been considered, the width for purpose of calculation. The length of the belt of 100 miles is verifiable from the map. Thus, the conclusion appeats that the Batanah date gardens cover 60 square miles. They conta n probably t e third biggest palmery in the world Basrah and Tafiliit being fes bigger. In these necessarily rough calculations, the number of palms per acre is reckoned at 50 # In the Wadi Samayil, the palm are so big, that,if they were closer that 50 feet e to each other i the fromds of mx ® neighbouring palms would greatly intermingle. In the Batanah, the palms are less vigorous; and, in the gardens w ' where there_are no fruit treep,they are toas frequently at closer intervals. However, in consideration of the large number of fruit trees at the southern end of the belt, of the bare clearings amongst the palms, and of the uncultivated condition of many of the TAWlAMf 50 bearing palms per acre for the whole area is probably not too low.The date gardens of the Wadi ^amayil are reminisceii. ©f south Morocco: the rocky, picturesque scenery, the white clo thes and I ..AMAT, the plastered irrigating channels, the under^ ground streams, and the MUSH liA-LAJC ? for, f How do you do? 1 are common to hotiu And if the ^amayil 'be liice Morocco, then the Batanah has points of resemblance eith the Shatt al Arab district^ the long, ccntinuous strip fif palms 'between' water and a salty plain, and the perponderatmg influence of the date palm on the life of the people. But then the squeaking of the water-hoists quickly reminds one he is far from Basrah 1 s tidal irridation. There are also picturesque thickets of SUMAR? GEAP, and other trei s&gt; where palms are lost to view# On«r almost expects fairies to appe: r, But the weather is probably too hot for them. who ever heard of a sweaty fairy? Perhaps, though, there are jinu. Cultivation. On a previous page, the cultivation of a date garden has bee.- Aoticed, and the implements therefor. It was stated that one f the reasons cultivation was slight was the lightness of the soil, Another is that weeds are few* there being no v/ater to spare for them. One labout the Omani has, which the Iraqi has not, is the removal of surface stanes. As in all places where date palms are grown commerce cially, in Uman, they are grown from offshoots. They areplanted out, when still quite small, half the sixe usual in the Iraq. Perhaps, in the Iraq, a big shoot is necessary, so that the root may be beneath the surface salt. 50 to 75;. sgcx are said to survive. A PIATE XXVII. Young SI-uLAH uffshoots at Sib, These small shoots are sometimes planted in nursery beds. ^ALBAH, Q^LBAT. ^ey are much less ..rapped up than t those of the Iraq, probably because winter in the Batanah and near the .coast brings no frost, and because, in summer, there is no, or less, tearing rc^inj, scorching, blasting, dust.laden, Iraqi SHAMAL, the /. wind from the burnt-up desert. The off shoots are planted nearly always in pits. Perhaps this is because the pit provides shelter, perhaps because the roots get nearer the sub-soil water,but more lively, it is so that the roots are buried ftrmly in the light soil, and are anchored against high winds. Many are the palms seen, supproted by palm buttress es. Sometimes, a palm, likely to fall, is held in gx place by a stone wal-i four feet high r and six feet in diameter. The space between the boll and the wal is filled in with rammed earth. ; On the whole, planting is less regular than in the Shatt al Arab district though in some gardens, the palms are set rightly at the corners of squares. The uneveaness of the land may be a contributary cause of irregular planting, though the same excuse does not hold for the Batanah. The price of offshoots of most of the coiamon varieties is twenty or thirty PAI, or about bj6 , each; but PABABH offshoots command twice that. H' PiATS XXVIII Offshoots planted in Pits in a harden of Faradh palms at Sifalah. A seedling is known as Q^SH.

'fi , £2- ^ -CG Z/' 71In Morth Africa, and thru the date palm zone to Persia, .the dead fronds are cut off close&gt; and distally&gt; to the swollen base# In a yeajb s time the swollen base, now hard and dry, is cut off close to the trunk, and used for firewood. In Tfcian, the swollen base is not cut off, perhaps because the SUMAR and other trees provide eyerywhere abundant fuel, ^imilarl ■ in the Punjab, the bases are left on the palm* In California* also, the frond bases were not cut, until recently. Some apprehension was felt, when it was observed that roots were growing out of the trunks underneath the frondbases, and were pushing the litter off. From -what appeared in the fcfedi Samayil, where roots could be found ccmiuonly pushing off the frond bases to a height of six feet from the ground, this root production is not harmful to the palm. The frond bases once pushed off, the aerial roots dry up cUid drop off. The trunk is called GARIDAH, v/hen alive, out, when dead, and cut up for the carpen ter, it is called GADHUAH. In the Iraq, JOCME GADHUAH is the trunk alive or dead, while JARIDAH is the frond midrib. Cf. the district of the JAHID in Tunisia. The frond, in the Wadi Samayil» is ZURAH, pi. zm. / The vigour of the Samayil palms is astonishing. The average height is half as high again as that of the Iraqi palms; fronds twenty feet lond are common; and trunks were seen which looked three feet in diameter, thought thay were not measured. And these are the palms which have been subjected to a nine years' drought. Many palms, in the drier parts of the oases, ka have died, but not a large proportion of the whole. PiATE XXIX. Pead palms in the Oasis of ^iitqah al Aliyah, with Terraced Wheat Land in Poregrcund. Almost all the palms in the oasis of Milt^ah al Aliyah ha^te died; a great many are dead in Al Araqat; and some are dead in Sifal&amp;h, Ghubrah, Khunar, Awainst, hasas, Sarpr, and Miltqah al Hadariyah.

Date of Hipeninp:. of In Matrah and Maskat on the 3rd/June, therewere available, and had been for some days, MG-IiAL DATLS^ialf way between KBALAL and RATA33. These had come from the Batanah. Unripe dates are green. When they reach fxull size, the green oiE colour of the skin changes to yellow, or red, or red and yellow. The fiesh is still firm, i^any varieties stage are edible, though there is still so much unfeippre &gt; o'ara4ed &gt; tannin in others, that they cannot be eaten, until a later stage of ripening be reached. Dates, at this stage of ripening are known as iCHALAL in the Iraq, but as BISIR in tJman and in/ U i 4n Borth Africa. RA.TAB dates are those wiiicli have developed 'be- yondthe iaiA-UA-L stage and the flesh has softened. The dated are now syrupy and sticky. On further drying, the dates become -AiuAja , firmer aid dar:er than the RATAB. In Oman, TAI^AR are call ed SAH. Dates picked in the HATAB stage go had in a few days: in the TAMAR stage, they keep for elser, if protected from insects, because of the high sugar concentration. In the Samayil ff on the 7th June, KHALAL were common, and had been so for ober a week; but ti ey had not yet begun to soften into RATAB. It was not until the first week in July that any a HA-UAL were seen in the Basrah market. These were KAILAwI, selling at eight annas a HIK^AI^i.e, 6.4 a lb. The earliest date^ in the Wadi Bamayil are thus six weeks earlier that the earliest in Basrah. In the Batanah, they a are probably two months earlier. It is stated that Oman has -ilAML and RATAB dates for five months in the year, beginning with HAG t I j AL and QA-SH BATASH, and anding with the winter varieties of xJiASAB AMfi HIliALI. In -^asrah, the season is between four and five months long, beginning with BRAIH and ending with 3HASAB. Cooked uates. Ther is a great tazade in cooked BISIR, in the Ira; , called KiiAULu MARBUKHf in Persia ilHABAiC, The MABA.SLI variety is that which is most commonly cooked; but there are mai.y other varieties? amongst which are the BA.TM and the UMMI, The export of these cooked dates is almost all to India; and they, and other (BEAIM AliD CHIBCBAB) from Basrah, can be found in most north Indian -bazars.

In the Baranah, the majority of palm boils are more or less scored with borer holes and, in some cases, are half eaten away. IBytranychus . the wei- spinning, red, spider was met with rarely, most commcnly in the dry, northern end of iQiubar. A disease called MAKAQ, was well known, but no afflic ted palms were seen. It was said that a honey-like substance covers the date bunches and spoils them. Yield, The yield of palms this year in the Wadi Samayil is probauly tweice that of those in the Shatt al Arab district. If 50 lb. a palm be the average yield i)er palm in the 3a tter loca tion, in the former, it might be put at 100 lb., and, in the Batanah, at 75 lb. The commonest number of spadices, or fruit bunches, AS^AH, pl.ASA^, in the Iraq, ATIiftAE and ATHAQ,, in the aaraayil, was 9. The average per palm was perhaps 8. In the Ba tanah, there were gardens where the yield appeared truly extra ordinary. In some of these particular gardens, no palm had less than 12 to 15 bunches, and each bunch would have weighed at harvest about lb lb. In the very best gardens of Basrah also, t ther are palms, HALIAWI, which are stated to produce loO lb. of 1 III iruit annually. A hundred palms such as theue would thus produce more sugar in an acre than is produced by the same area of the finest sugar cane grown under pptimum conditions. What is the total yield of dates, as cooked BISIR and as SAH, is a question for the solution of wHbh the data are of the scantiest. If the previously suggested figures for yield and numbers be prorisionaj-ly accepted, t-ie the 2,b00,000 palms. in palms, bearing each. 85 ln« of dates, would give a total produc tion of about 95,000 tons. But, to be on the cautious side, it would be as' well to assume that the other vallies, not seen, are driet and less productive than the Samayil, that the northern end of the Batanah is less flourishing than the southern, and tha the average yield per palm over the whole country is nearer, say, 60 In, per palm than 85. On this basis, the total production would amount to 57,000 tons, but a remaric is appended to show that these custom house figures represent about half the actual total export. That was before the reorganisation of the Maskat customs. There is a large export to the interioE, if one may put it so; but, probab ly greater than either the land or the sea export, is the local demand. Pates enter more into the diet of the populace than they do in the Itao, since wheat and barley are not grown on a large scale, and. rice not at all. 4 £x.ice it The price dates were selling at last year, when the crop was considered short, varied in the gardens from 50 RIAii a BAJIAR for UMM BILiAH to 50 or 60 RIAL for FAEABE and MABABLI, i.e. from 1 / a lb. to 2. juast year, the high Basrah prices per aps affected the tjman marine t.

The PARADE inxtoc palm is the commonest in the seven miles of the oasis of A1 Aliyah Sifalah-Ghuhrah-Xhuhas, where is m may perhaps constitute one-third of the palms.

The date is small and dark reddish b brown. The stone is small, the flesh firm, and the skin not easily 'broken. The flavour is strong. The harvest is not very early for 0man, 'being in the early part of August near the coast, out at the end of that mon-th further inland. This date is the only one shipped to America in large quantities. This trade is old estab lished, as there are records of as many as four ships calling for these dates to take -thim to America in the one year 1076. In 1884, the exports to America are first shown separately 'by the custom authorities.

The total crop, within a radius of two days( donkey journey of Mat rah, probably does ^ot exceed 5, h 5.0p^ton8. For 1900, the price of FARADH dates was only slightly, thaA that of the other dates exported.

The KHALAL are a fine, dull carmine and appearing in the groves when the other dates have'long been cut are striking. Last year's TAMAR were to be obtained in Matrah market this June. ItHIUAIZI palms were found at uhallah and at A1 Hil. The red jk HALAL were in Matrah Market on the 4th of June. The fronds are outstanding. The leaflets are somewhat closely appressed to the mid rib. The dates are said to be excellent. There are LAZAD palms in the Wadi Samayil, but none were seen in the Batanah. The dates were green msX early in June. The RATAB are said to be good. The MABASLI variety is one of the four commonest in A1 Aliyah; there are a few palms at A1 Kil; and it is said to begone of the three commonest varieties of KHAUDH. It is said that it is the com monest variety in the Wadi Maawil. It can claim to be one of the lead ing varieties of Uman and for export. Almost the entire crop, if not all, is made into cooked i3lSIR # and it is in that form that it is exported. It is a dearer date than KHASAB. The MADLUKI variety is found in the Wadi and at AL Hil; The miKZIF was seen in the Wadi, and at Sib, though not at A1 Hil The palm is HALLAWI like, with long, thin fronds. The dates were still green the first txxzhsjm week in June, rather narrow and t rather long. MIZMAG palms were seen at A1 Hil, ^hallah, and many in the Wadi Samayil. There are palms called MIZMAd AL BAHAR and others called ffllZUAG AL UMKN; but these are thought to refer to the same variety. The KHALAL are'red and xzacsxxK were on sale in Matrah market on the 4th of June. Yellow KHALAL, called MASRI, were on sale at the same place on the same day. The SA^BAL variety is one of the commonest. There are some at A1 Hil, and they are said to be common all along the Batanah. Thay are said to be one of the commonest sorts at i'injah and Khaudh.

Of all the fruit trees to be found more or less in the shade of date palms in the oases&gt; and »o¥/here else, pro bably the smallt sour lime, LUMAH, of. the ITUMI of the Iraq, is the commonest. The tree is bush-like, and of a dense ; very dark green foliage. There is no pruning. The limes are of particularly excellent quality; and there is a great trade in them, both fresh and dry, and a considerable export of the latter. Few other citrus trees are to be seen in the Bata- nah, out large numbers of many varieties in the Samayil. The following kinds were seen SHAMUMf BALIl^GX, LIIMAH, ASFARGrlL HARI1GI, SHIGA!

It is said that the number decreases rapidly from Sib northwards alon^ the Batanah. They are to be found in most of the oas-^s of the Wadi Samayil, at least, up to Hub| In the Wadi, they fruit later than on the coast. The commonest ^fcnd is the big ZAiM4ii*ii* variety, and also a little one, red on one sidej The stately trees, the biggest in all the land, provide grateful, dense shade over the TAWIANtanks and water-hoists. The nixt most common fruit is the Guava, here called ZAITUB, though in the Iraq, this word means f oxive ! ASJARGIL, noted above as being the Sweet Lime in Oman means * quince* in the Iraq. Like onions, these guava s can oring tears to the eyes, for they smell jtof strawberries-- England, June, and strawberries', the flesh pink.Cashew 2Jut trees are fairly common in the i&gt;atanah, and possibly somewhat less so in the Wadi # They, like the iixangoes make imposing shade trees, and appear to find the climate favourable. The ^.ianis adapt the Urdu wordf and call the tree BIDHAM. There is a tree met with singly or in twos and threes in most gardens. It is foumd in Basrah. It grows, as a rule, to a height of less than gOfeet; the leaves are evergreen and large; end it is a good shade tree. The fruit is the size of a crab apple, yellow, soft, thin-skinned, with flesh that is like the stickiest of starch slightly flavoured with extract of fig and banana. If one have much of it when thirsty, he notices he astrinkency. Saturation point is soon reached, is this and eugenia? in Gujarat, where it is also found, it goes by the name of G-AICDAB. In the Iraq, it is BAMSAH, in tfaian GAU. The remaining fruit trees are all more or less uncommon. Bananas , MAU2, ; re grovm in some gardens, and not in others. iHecterinest KHAUEE, and pomegianites, RTOAIi, are not much in evidence. The latter are said to be especially common, and of especially good quality, sweet, succulent, and smalleeeded, on the Gabal Akhdar. There also vines, AftAB are said to flourish exceedingly. In the Wadi and the Batanah, vines were few. In Algeria, AMB is the fruit zizyphus. It is curious how crop names are transposed in different Arabic-speaking districts. Only two or three cocoanuts, UAEGIL, and papaya, FIFAI, were to be seen. These are at Sib. Ground Cyops t On the whole, ground crops are not an extensilpely grown as might have been expected. Perhaps the nine years' drought has made water so scarce, that there is available only for the more important date palms. In those gardens, where water is plentiful, as for example, those at the southern end of A^ Aliyah, lucerne covers most of the ground. PlATi; XXXVII. A field of Lucerne. In the Middle -distance, FARADH palms. In the Background, the Gabal as Suq, A1 Aliyah. Here, the lucerne is GAT, in the Iraq, JAT. It is watered twice a week, is cut once a month, and lasts for five years without resowing. The prices varied in early June in the oases from 18 to 22 Maskat PAI a Maskat i.e. about i / a lb. The yield in most gardens did nut look heavy. Perhaps a ton a-n acre is a fair estimate fcr each outfilag. On this basis, an acre of lucerne would produce an annual crop worth about IGo^^gross, provided prices remained the same throughout the year, or ever twice the average annual value of the date crop. Probably though, in winter, when water is plentiful, the price of lucerne is low. Also, the gardens which grow lucerne are the gardens where water is plentiful, and where the palms are of more valuable variet-ixes and produce more heavily than the average. However, the lact is undeniable that lucerne, where a market for it is handy, is a valuable crop. Probably owing to water shartage, as in the Saharan oases, millets are more grown than lucerne. The commoner of the two grown is a dwalf Bulrush Millet, BAZARI the other adwarf common Millet, SHASHMAR* These.are usually grovm in small irrigation beds, like lucerne, and sometimes in fringes round the palm watering pans. BAZAHI is so much the staple fodder, that it is usually called TAAM, wher^ in the Iraq this would usually denote 1 wheat 1 . The sar23 soil of 'flman drains tlie water away rapidly; and the fodder crops accordingly either suffer from water shortages or else have to 'be restricted to those inferior varieties, which are more drought resistant than the others• Improved irrigation methods would .roDahly produce an increase in fodder and ground croijs generally. Another fodder, widely grown, is a low grass ( Cvnodon? called (RA.SHIDIVAH. Biebuhr mentions DURRAH and LUKHAJEp tout no one was encountered bu. the waiter who understood these terms, although these are well known in the Iraq. Wheat and barley are grown, as a rule, at the tails of the oases, on terraces labouriously levelled and freed from stores. The winter fiow of the springs is presumable greater than that of the summer, and a surplus presumably flows from the palmeries out to the garain. But little was grown last year; and prices, despite a bid import from India, ruled high. The word iiA-TAH is not understood; wheat is called 1JU3B, BARK, ALAS, or SIP# The harvest was said to have finished in RAMAPHAi^ and to ue threshed by hand, using the flail or MIQ .SHA. There is everywhere a remarkable scarcity of vege tables# Colocasia, FlilBAL, cf • the Iraqi HABDAL, Cow Pes, LUBIYAH, Egg Plant, BAIDHA1JAH, Onions, Busal, Vegetable Marrow AQTIH, were all that were seen growing in June, and these in but small quantities# Of these, onions were by far the commonest. Fibres are represented by cotton, GUTAli, which is grown in odd corners in Batanah gardens# There is a red as well . as a yellow flowered variety# The staple is half inch. The bushes are more or less perennial. The leaves are small and much in dented. The cotton is woven into the strong, coarse cloth used for the WUZAR or loin cloth. Hone of the sugar cane, v /hich Dr. Harrison mentions were seen. Castor oil plants grow here and there semi-wild, and sometimes sown. KHARKAH is understood, though ARASH is the usual woed# The oil is extracted from the seeds, but is not used aperient, as it is ill the Iraq, but to anoint the body in cases of siclmess. The leaves are put over the newly henna-ed hand. 'lowers are almost absent, a few roses and a little jasmine. dAtt r ftAG-cM, l4 ft R.

Such practices are condemned by the more orthodoa They are probably survivals of an older religion than that of the prophet* nere, as elsewhere in Islamic, and other, countries, the Evil Eye is known and feared* Bones are tied to palms, put on garden walls, or bjialt into houses, just like the ^healing stonesl of the Hebredes, to guard against this fcver-present menace, uy the way-side, v/ere encountered often heaps of stones, presumably ~ collected from the surrounding area* The piles might have been ^ four or five feet high, and twelve feet or more across at the bast The guides, when asked the reaon for those heaps, gave conflictirg stories, fltiike only in their improbability-* Either they did not know the reason, or they did not wish to communicattit* Have these heaps any superstitious meaning?

The men have the proper, picture-book, Arab faces, though their chins are ratner too receding, and, instead of a small, pointed, trimmed beard, their chins are made hideous with an unkempt fringe of wiry, black beard, rather like jrarmer Hayseed's except for the color'. These are not a hairy people, so perhaps they feel they have not enough b^ard to lose any 'by trimming# The negroes in the Batanah are more robust; 'but even these appear thinner, shorter, and slighter than teir brethren ; elsewhere* The little boys are often pretty, with full lips, well curved, large, black eyws, and unprominent chins. One is reminded of portraits of young Spanish noblemen of the avII th and J&amp;VTII th centuries. Often on the children lies a langorous, sickly pallor. Is it malaria? The woman may be plain; but they look one straight in tne face; and that alone, after the absurd esties of other Muhammad an women in covering up their charms, makes them —- attractive. Their demeanor is grave and decorous, save when^the sight of topee, trousers, and dark glasses proves too much for them, and compels them to break dovirn into paroxysms of helpless giggles. Mow describe the little girls? 'Dainty rogues in porcelain' is quite unsuitable, Say, hard -working, thin, ffver- stricken, hapx&gt;y, little wenches. 'VThen dressed in nothing but their little red trowsers, they are, if the expression be allowed, a scream. Clothes . Full dress consists of a loin cloth, WUZAR, woven locally, either from home-grown cotton, or, more usually, from Indian yarn. The width of the looms is j^out eighteen inches. Consequently, two widths of cloth are swn together to mafce one WUZAR, about three feet wide. The length is about six feet. The color is usually white; but a great number of other colors are allowed. Both borders are always gaily striped. To put on the WUZAR, one holds it behind him, the upper edge against the waist, the lower against the ankles, then gssgg. pulls the two ends forward, keeping the middle of the mJZAR in the middle of the back. The two upper corners are now drawn together, crossed over, and tucked under the folded edge drawn tightly round the waist. A thin, cotton shirt, THAUB, is worn over the OTZAR, and also reaches the ankles, or nearly so. The front and throat opening is held closed with studs, or, in slightly differently shaped shirts, with a single button at the neck, not quite at' the centre. Often a red line is embroidered along the yoke, round the collar, and along the edge of the front opening, and in the middle of the waist. Although the commonest color for shirts in the towns is white, ^ret, in the country, khaki shirts ci.^. e common, especially amongst the poorer classes. A suspicion that these shirts also were originally white was allayed byinauiry- A white, openwork, high-crowned, cotton, skull cap is ^ worn, beneath a large Kashmiri, embroidered, colored, woollen^ turban, often held in place by black, woollen, binding coro^. Important, and religious people usually ^ear v/hite turbans, but the color of a turban appears to be as much a matter of in dividual taste as of vocational or social distinction. A belt HAZAKU more or less ornamented, holds in Iront a dagger ^ scabbard, the apical three cr four inches of which is a. rig.it -^np-les to the rest. This holds the curved degge^., the KH a LG- t JI, with ornamented hilt. The Iraqi KHAHGAR is of the same type; but the scabbard is curved thruout its length, and avoids the curious rectangle. Umani daggers vary in value irom 10 RIAL for that of the camel driver to 500 RIAL and more lor one inlaid aud with pold and gems for shaikhly use. SandaXs may, or may not, be worn. OccasionaXly, a bright and richly embroidered watis - coat or Zuave Jacket, ZAKiiMAH or SIDAIRI, is worn, especially by the negro servajits of the wealtny. The woollen cloak, the at *\ or BISHIT» so characteristic a part of the dress ox the Stb of the north of Arabia, or the HAIK or JUBBAH or BUP.IIUS typical of imrth Africa, is here unknown. Consequently, the ■people here have an undressed appearance to one used to their more northerly cousins. It is apparently not such a breach of etiquette to uncover the head, as tt is elsewhere m Arab land; and the small scull cap is head-dress full enough for even^ ceremonial occasions, whereas, in the Iraq^ the corresponding ARAKCHTN is only undress^ Woman * s dress is composed of three pi eces# ^irst are the trowsers, SARTCL, tight fitting from ankle to knee, above that loose, and drawn in to the waist by a tape, TICHGHAR. Cotton cloth is the material and red the commonest color, though blakjc, is common too, and greens and blues and other colors are seen. The colored cloth has generally a small ^ psttern in white. Becond, comes a shirt, DISHDASHAH, reaching to the knee, or a little below, more often reo. axso with a small white pattern, but often also of other colors. Jrequenuly there is gay embroidery round the neck, and on either side of the opening at the throat. Round the head, face, and throat, worn a cloth, MASHWAR, which leaves the face exposed, but cover the hair. The free end falls down the back. Red again is the commonest color. The susceptibillities of the umani are moi.e easily offended than those of the shpper on 42nd Street or-Bu-fth Avenue; and, though menls clothew are everywhere displayed in the market, it is not so with the women T s. Only the cloth, as Vet bearing no disturbing likeness to the female shape, is sold in the shops; and she who would have clothes mu^it either ^ake the cloth to be made up at a tailor r s, or, preferably, be her own tailor. Food. Perhaps the nine year's drought in the land is making the people hungry. Certainly, the style of living is below that of the Iraq, rank for rank# Only one grain meal a day is eaten, and that at noon, even amongst shaikhly folk. Morning and night dates are the fare. Heat is rare. Tea is hardly drunk. At Sib, a curious custom was observed. After coffee had been handed round, in the same cups, liot milk was offered to each- guest. Diseases . To a non-medical eye, the whole population looks as though it suffers acutely from malaria. Certainly the doctors report malaria as rempant in Maskat town in the winter months, now far the seemingly gentle, listless nature of the inhabitant is due to race, how far to an ^ttrocious, humid climate, and how far to malaria is a nice point to determine. A leper cilony was passed near Khubar, and an old leper was seen begging for alms. Lepers are not allowed in the villages, markets, or assemblies of the MUSLIMIiSU Syphilis 7;as heard of; and the hot spring of Ghallah is said to be efficacious in this disease and for skin diseases in general. Bye defects, blindness, squints, and grey tilms across the cornea appeared common.

Still, despite the adage of the fools and the angels, first impressions, 'by force of contrast with what one is used to, have a certain value# The first thing that strides a tripper, and probably also tne enduring impression of the old resident, is the attractiveness of the people# What is the reason? Is it that, as some men are supposed to love their wives as .much for tneir faults as for their virtues, westerners find chords of aympathy with traits in the Arab character, they do not find in many other Orientals, not virtuous perhaps, but skin to their own? Probably the dmani i&amp;rab would be called lazy# The cultivator works, of course, and works hard; but the garden owner does not. Perhaps though these people are not more lazy than .English people# Perhaps the difference one notices is that isngllsh people are actively lazy, while these are passively lazy# If they have not to w&amp;rk, English people go the Riviera, play tennis, hunt, go to meetings, read novels, or shop# but, here, the richer sort like just to sit# as for mental laziness, one is probably as bad as the otner# These shaikhs are not interest -ed in golf# If one tries to talk economies to either, he is apt to make himself a bore# The politemess of the Umanis is remarkable# Their constant courtesy could not have been a personal matter, but most have been typical# One of the two Europeans employed by the state is the Minister of Finance#* But, in Europe, if the tax collector were an Arab, would Arabs be popular?

In ttie Iraq, TIRYAFv or AlfYUK are the names of opium; but neither was understood in the ¥aai Saraayil. SKARAS was mentioned as a smokable drug, its use forbidden by the learne -ed* $one was seen; but, 0Y /ing to the sifliilarity of name with the Indian 'charas*, it is probably hemp. Singing does not appear to be either more or less fairably looked upon than elsewhere in Islam. The donkey lads and herdsmen sing to themselves; but respectable people would hesitate to be so undignified. i?or some nights before the jp ADH DHAHAIYAH # the girls of each village would go out therefrom, end, collecting beneath a GRAF tree, give themselves to song. KLeasing were their voices coming thru the moonlit groves. And tnis is an annual practice, so it is said. Pancing is a prerogative of the males of the tribe. Eacn evening of the ID, tne lads from the date gardens of the Sib district, vritn tneir tiny brotners witn them, who nardly were to be seen for mighty \urbans., assembled on clearings outside the larger villages. Oay were tne new clotnes, anowy wnite tne shirts, hrilliant with new dies tne turbans, and p^Mshed the silver in the dagger and sword hilts and seabbards, a brave signt. The music makers were the tom-tom beaters, ana the circled spectators clapped their hands in time. In the centre, danced first siggle lads, then lines of them, each holding his sword. .From a far knoll, watched tne women* One wife is tne rule, more only amongst the wealthiest. On the eve of the DHAHAIYAK festival no sacrifice to Tonus is allowed. The following night, so it ife ssdd, there is a curious pr^liminaryvETxstom. On the death of a man, his widow takes one- eighth of Irts property^ and, of the remainder, the sons take two shares each to one share of each of the daughters. Contrary to the Iraqi custom, which otherwise is the name. Instead of one*- third of the property being §et aside, before any shares are taken, for religious charities, for prayers, and the provision of the baked meats, the funeral expenses are borne collectively 'by the sons* PLATE XXXVI. The Well-built Hut of a Prosperous cultivator beneath a GRAF Tree at Sib. li'ven in the Wadi Samayil, as far up as A1 Ally ah, there is never ice in winter time. The cultivators * huts are made of palm fronds closely fastened to one another, and from which the leaflets, have been cut almost to their bases. At Ghallah, huts were seen, which consisted of palm frond frames, against whibh palm frond walls were rested. These walls are taken down at night to allow tne air to penetrate, iilven so, the huts are too airless for most of the people to sleep within them; as tne sand duns, at night, is,covered with sleeping figures, the women and girls nearer tne nouses, the men and boys further away. The duns, in the moonlight, might be a corpse littered battlefield. In the Samayil too, the Wadi bed was the fa^Dorite sleeping place in June In the Batanah, nouses are sometimes raised four or five feet off the ground on palm logs. In Maskat and Matrah, the bigger houses are v/ell built of stone* PLATE XXX^II* A Stree in Maskat* (Jraves are often neatly edged round Y^ith stones jsaars of stones often mare a grave.

The country of Uman, to the west of MasJcat, is under tne control of a quite independent Imam, by name Muhammad. He, and his powerful and vigorous adviser, Shaikh lea, are particularly^ averse to European penetration. Bach oasis, or group ol oases, is in charge of a snaiKh responsible to the Imam. One such shakh, that of 0 Bidbid, Sulaiman al Baruni by name, is an interesting personality.

Americans he regarded only with mild suspicion, ne had known Saiyid Talib Pasha, when the latter nad sat witn nim in council in Stambul, before trie war, and he v/as glad of news of his old friend, ne was particularly interested in tne wnereab&amp;uts of the Minister of Finance of Maskat and trie officers and their widely advertised attempt to get to the Baraimi oasis; and rumor nas it tnat it is al Baruni himself wno has kept tnem out of tnat place. The whole subject of airplanes and Imperial Airways was one on which, he was anxious for information. The question of Cyprus and a possible new king for that island he discussed for some little time. Judging by the precautions he observed, he must be in some fear of assassination* Both the Sultan and the Imam take ZAKAH, or one-tenth of the gross crop of dates, as tax. Estimators are sent round annually to Judge the crop and prepare demand notes. The --- cultivators of Awaibi said they paid no taxes, and gave as reason that the Sultan loved them. ^ There is a British Political Agent and Consul at Maskat There was an American Consul there too, but not now. 0 PLATE XX j OTTII.

Passports are not used in Maskat or Uman. TRADE The money of the country consista of the silver RIAL and the copper PAI. T n early June, in Matrah, 234 PAI made up~a KML, hut tne-burober varies with time and place. Th■BMBMi The RIAL fluctuates with tne rupee# At the same place, at trie same time, 100 RIAL equalled 165 rupees, i.e. each RIAL was worth! 59 cents and each PAI a quarter of a cent* The market weights, which, are slightly less than tne customs weights of the same name, are as follows I- 1 KIAS equals 5.67 oz. equals 5.71 RIAL 24 KTA3 do 8 lb.8 oz. do 137 do equals 1 MAN 10 MA2J do 1 FARSALAH, 20 TARSAL AH equals 1 BAHAR, Kiehuhr states tnat,. in his day, customs duty on goods imported or exported, belonging to Europeans, was 5 on those belonging to Muhammadans 6} %, and on those belonging to Indians and Jews 9 iiow-a-days, a flat rate of 5 % is supposed to be ^©vigd on all articles entering and leaving tne tjultdn iLSjcxx territory. Of tne manufactures, perhaps boat building is as importan as any. The boats are made chiefly at Bur; and are good sea craltj manned also by good seamen. The iDoats come alongside tne steamer in a sailor-like way, not, as at Muhammarah, as if with^pleasure at tne helm and Folly at the Frow.' Finely woven, woollen shirts, KUHI)UFAN, are made at Al Gailan* Cotton cloth is woven in most villages. Of industries, agriculture is the most importa.nt, except for the rocky parts of the coast, where the population lives chiefly by fishing. Also, all along the isatanah, fishing is important* PLATS XL. The SHASHAH. One curious kind of cheap, fishing boat is tne SHASHAH, made of palm fronds, and filled with palm frond bases. The deck floats level with, the surgace of the water, and the fisherman gets very wet# Fish flesh, including that ol sharks, dolphins, and sharks fins, is dried, salted, stacked, baled, ajad exported to India, the Straits, and China. The presence of a fish factory is indicated for a considerable distance before it is seen# At the end of consular reports, there is usually a paragrapn headed, 'Oportunities for tne iUxtension of British Trade.^In the case of tne Mafckat reports, tnis paragraph is usually filled as follows, 'There are no opportunities for tne extension of British trade'# But this is surely incorrect, were the soorts of the people catered for, quite a large trade could probably be built up. The articles required are powerful aphrodisiacs and cheap magazine rifles and cartridges.Cartridges are dear. Whereas, in tue ivuwait factory in the Iraq, they are made for seven cents each, in the V/adi Samayil, they cost twenty cents; so that a man, whose pay is, perhaps, only about ten celit; a day or less, has to tnink twice before paying off old scores COUGLIJSIOU Those who go to not very well known districts usually complete their reports by lists of the underclothing and tabloid foods considered necessary to take with them. The most valuable part of the equipment it is suggested the traveller to Uman takei with him, for his solace a.nd refreshment, is a volume of feeredit: If one should have found, many years ago, in easeful cloth, he needed his fiction pre-digested, and, having tried to read a certain of the Master r s novels, had failed, and that not till Uman was reached, where is little food and mucn walking, had a proper receptiveness been deyeloped, and he had gobbled up the tale and asked for more, why then, tne journey will have been worth while, however little else the gain# One further remark. The aesthetic continental tourist has ^ frequently remarked tnat German scenery is spoiled by the habit ol tne natives oi putting a Birhans on tne tpp of each of theirtneir mountains* Possibly it is true tnat tnis nabit spoils Germany; 'but few tnings would so improve uman as its very wide spread adoption;, and, until something of tnat sort is done, this | country cannot really expect to develop its tourist trafl'ic^ PLATE XLI» Maskat from the Bea^—Confidential Ho, B. 0.

In this connection the recent appearance of the American . •. tajesty• s Principal Secretary of State foreign Affairs in the ueoartment of teas Trade, t do n. !American silver Line in the Gulf, mainly i ie Trnderstood with relation to tiie 'Iraq date export traae, may not be without significance. 3. xhe undeairaMXity from the point of Yie^ of British interests, Ijoth political and commerciai, of the acquisition by any large foreign firm of a concession on the Arab coast ©f the Gulf requires no emphasis and I feel that all possible steps should he taken to guard against such an eventuality. 4. as far as I am aware the only important British firm in this region lilcely to be able to exploit the possibilities of the Batineh date gardens are the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, ihis firm have an Indian representatire at Muscat, but I doubt whether they fully realise the possibilities of the Satineh date crop.

Thirdly, that the prices of dates are cheaper in Muscat than in Basrah« fhis year, the average price in Basrah for the commonest variety, Sayir, haa aver ged Rs 250/- a karah &gt; and the price of the choicest of the big commercial varieties, Haltawi, is EiJ 600/- a karah , Thi^ corresponds to Es 105/ a ton and Es 247/- respectively.

I agyoe vdth you afeaat the possibilities of exten sion of the iTasoat trade in Sates and certainly if your firm donH do so someone else will do so eventually# As you know, the date tree is found in all parts of the Oman Sultanate and flourishes eiren at an altitutde of over 2000 feet# The ohipf areas are Batinah, V /adl S email and Sharqiyan. the Tard is groTO chiefly in Small* fh© Mlbaali is the prin cipal one in .Badiyah and Shar^iyah whence it is exported through Sur hy dhow to Bombay ♦ In the Batinah, the plantations froia an ulmost oontinous he It, sometinea 7 miles deep, along the ooast. Uhe belt is at least 1Z0 miles long* There is no nuestion about the length bat I have been unable to trace any reliable authority regarding its average depth. ' n^Hi mi i IIId HO ■ifrtipw ^he ^reat valleys on the seavm^ slope of Western Hajar all travers the Batlnaii on their way to the sea, but their courses within the limits of the Batinah are often ill defined and in some oases their channels are so broken up and dispersed as to render uncertain the point at which they reach the sea# It is probably in the lower reaches of these wadis that the belt reaches its greatest depth# In the valleys themselves, the date palms are grown on terraces# Working westward frota Sib, at Barl:ah, ^hich is celebrated 'j for forcits dates, there are villaees 3,4 and 6 miles inland with dates groves# At Hasnaah, the groves belonging to the place are S to 2 miles deep^ lluladah is 7 miles inland south west of Masnaah# The place depends on its extensive date groves which are divided only by a narrow wadi from those of llasnaah. ******* • bslt of at least 7 miles as quotedabove from aaothar authority. Behind Wadam a^airi there are 4 villas 03 from 6 to 6 miles inland all with extensive grove©, Su&lt;iai&lt;i is the port for the Wadi 3ani Cthafir# The upper portion of the Wadi contains at least S5,000 palms amongst other crops• The lower portion is said to contain the same orops so I presume it also contains date palms though I do not the number, Khabarah is the port for the Wadi Hawasinah t Quasaf, one hoar inland, contains extensive groves, though I cannot say whether these are oontlgous with those of Khaburah# At least 9 places in the T ? adi Hawasinah have extensive groves. At Saham, the dates of tho place are estimated at about 30,000 but dates are grown in terraces in the Wadi Ahin and Wadi DhanJc behind it • At Sohar, the Batinah date belt is about 3 miles deep. On the other side of the Hajar range, at Ibri, there is an extensive date groves, stated by one authority to be the most extensive in Oman with the exception of Semall {presumab ly also excluding the Batinah, ^loh is not in Oman proper)# At Barimi, some of the best varieties of dates are grown, including Fard, Khalas and Mibsali but they are not held in equal estimation with those of Semall and Badly ah ♦ The palms are said to mdsmx aumber about 60,000. The breadth of the date belt along the Batinah is governed by the distance inland at which it is economic to work wells by the primitive methods at present in use# The wells are 15 to 20 feet deep# I dare say that with more modern methods of pumping water could be obtained economically at a greater distance from the coast thereby enlarging the area. The above data which are from reliable sources in my re cords are as near as answer as I can give you to questions 1 and 2# I think personally that you have untidy « taw * kthwrr underestimated the number of palms. Thirdly, as regards prices, I enclose alist I have the Sustoms wHich you oan compare for yoursel-PFourthly, you oould need export teohnioal advice to answer this gaestion* Shumal storms In the latter part of the oold weather sweep this coast and I think would wash away anything hat the strongest oonstraction. However a track has been made Tap the Muscat Infantry from Matrah through Bo she r to 31b (avoiding the pass and the soft sand on the beach.) and I have been an far as Sib in my oar. I have not tried going farther as yet bat a Ford car has been as far as Sohar and I understand there are no obstacles. Fifthly there oould not be political difficulties if the matter were approached properly by the right kind of man bat the Arab is naturally suspicious and if you started by bailding a pier he may think you have other motives and resent it. The track to the east of Khabarayt including Masnaah and Suwaik is inhabited by a troublesome tribe the 'Yal Saad Tt but otherwise the inhabitants are hannless enough. Simthly the dates are there bat I do not suppose that you could built up an enormous connection such as you contemplate all at once. The Banias trade through Arab brokers to whom I believe they advance money before the production of the dates, I do not know what you coald do by direct methods. As you see, your questions have not been as easy to answer as they seemed tie at first sight. Signed* G.p, ifurphy.lasra, 28th ^eoember 1928# Uajor a.

I have not yet their answer; but I have an answer to a previous letter on the subject; and I understand that the laatter interests them, and that they are prepared to try the dates from the Batinah this next season in a small way* Probably we shall get our agents to do this for us; b^t, in any case, I should be glad, if you would keep this confidential, at any rate, until we can oomplete our arrangements. Your letter is exactly what I was wanting. From the tiny scrap I saw, and from what I have been able to read up about the Batinah, I was convinced that it was the second biggest date garden in the world. Your letter confims my belief. But there is still a tremendous lot to find out, before we can do anything ve*y definite, I do not know; but I should imagine our people la jow fork would want to know very imioh more than they do at present, before they sank any money in Muscat or its vicinity. I have got some leave in April; but I have to be back again in Basrah by the end of imgust# I should much like to have another liok at the Oman and the Coast, and think that from point of view, the most useful time would be the end of July, when the date harvest should be begum So I think I will visit Muscat then, after taking a trip down the Nile, to get a glimpse of i.gypt and the ludan. What I should like to do very much is to take a Ford along the whole length of the Batinah; but I fear that might be rather expensive# If the Company thought it worth while to pay cay expenses, then I sfcould try and do that; bat, if the company would not pay my expenses, then I should be able to afford only a donkey, and I would got aa far as I oouldo with that.

Labour . Colonel Miles gives the following tribes as cult ivators of dates-tBani Ali,Bani Bu Ali,Bani Battash,Al; Rabus,Al Raj- riyin and Al Ibriyin.More often thannot the date gardens are the pro perty ®f absentee lords. In the cases,they are generally not far ab sent, since most of them live in the villages wMchform the oases centres. In winter here also the cultivatots live,though in summer they remain in the gardens. Many of the owners of Batanah date^ gardens live in Muscat or Matrah or in other of the larger coast towm A big landlord is called Hahkari. Malak is not understood,but RAI'AL Mai is frequently spoken of.The actual cultivation when not carried out by the peasant proprietor,Bardhul,pi. Baradhil,a word also jpeanin^ ♦a lazy fellow* is in the hands of a paid labourer, the Bidar,corres3&amp; ponding with the Jalah of the Iraq,enjoying less security of tenure than that provided by the Taabah tenancy of that country,or the Mauri, ' of the iPunjab.In the Wadix Samayil every Bidar receives,at date harve one bunch of dates from each palm irrespective of the number of bunch borne. In the Batanah on the other hand he never receives dates but nearly always money, some times money with food or with food and clothe In both districts,fruit other than dates is the exclusive property of the garden owner. There must be an immense amount of pilfering howeve Jallen fruit is the tenants right.The provision ofoff shoots,fruit tr and irrigating cattle and the food of the latter is on the owner.Luce seedand thpt of wheatand barley are also provided by the owner who ta foure»fifths of the crop from the former and nine-tenths of the crop o the tifO latter# Millet is usually grown on the same terms as lucerne but not invariably so.Truck and minotcrops are sown with the tenant's seed and are his own property. The amount in cash which a Batanah Bid receives,in the cases where no food and clothes are received is about five Rialat a month. This was the comnionest figure given in reply to questions.but an old man at Al -^il said he got fifty Rial a year and two younger fellows with him said they each got forty Mial. A garden near Rumais was looked after by a small boy and a jfcoung man* the forme got f Rial a month plus food and the latter 2^ Rialat plus food.Kadhi a merry and well spoken half negro half arab lad working in the garde of Saiyid Muhammad got 4 Rialat a month in addition to food and cloth but he seemed to be a favourite with the old man.Food is generally reckoned as being wotth f Rial a week. If then the average wage for a Batanah Bidar be only 60 Rial a year as the other emoliments are the same as those of the Wadi Samayil.,it might be supposed that 60 Rial is the value of one bunch of dates from every palm in the average holding of a ^amayil Bidat. If one bunch per palm be equivalent with one-eigth of the crop,the total crop would be worth on this basis 480 Rial .'With dates at 50 Rial a Bahar,the total production wojild be a little less than 10 Bahar # or 16,320 Ib.This amount of dates might be produced on 163. palms or about 3 acres of garden. Actually all the Ba - ; anah tenants appear to prefer to be paid as in the Saii5ril,so it may I presumed that the rate of pay ia higher there and that the area of a Samayil holding is greater than suggested above. Thatbthis presumptic is correct is borne out by the other,rough observations,which indical that the Samayil holding is nearer 4 or 5 acres than 3. In the Batana however the area is nearer 2.1n the latter district,the tenant has tc raise all the irrigation water from wellsiln the former,the water isI almost entirely proTided by flowing springsjconsequently the cultirator can manage a greater area. I-vva bad year, the Samayil cultirator soands to lose» Probably here is the explanation of t3 the high wage rate compared with the lower^but fixed and certain wage rate in the Batanah,further the wage rate in both districts is fixed by long custom|the drought must hare caused the prices of agricultural produce including dates to rise. Hence a cultiTa' paid in kind would be likely to be temporarily at least better ®ff than one recetaring a money wage# OultiTation and Implement s• so il of the whole area is light sand | There is no clay though Palgrave mentions the existence of a single bed of pottery clay near the coast not far from Ifetrah.# Drainage is excellent and there is no alkali land if the slight amount nowhere a rank growth of weeds and cultivation is o^e the ! scantiest and shallowest.

But this seems an over estimate.A figuren nearer 100 would seem more likely with the average number of acres in the Tawi as two and the average spacing of palms 30 feet acjsat3t.each way# ^he same informant considered that the irrigation, of the Tawi cost the owner 100 Hial a year,60 for the Bidar and 40 for the bull; but most people considered the bull as expensive as the man&lt;,Heckining that it costs 120 Rial a year to water and looc after 100 bearing palms,and reckoning the yield per Batanak palm as 75 lb then the cost of producing dates without any charge for supervision interest on capital or for taxes works out as 0.95 cents per pound. One tenth ofvthe gross crop is supposed to be rendered as government tax.The net return of each palm to the grower thus becomes 67-5 lb., so the cost of producing dates without reckoning anything for interes on capital or for supervision becomes 1^60 cents a pound.If the aver age prioe of dates in the Batanah gardens daring the season be 40 Rial a joodc Bahar,the price per pound is 1.4cents allowing 0.34 cents between the cost and the selling price of a pound. Young mature pa&amp;ms of good varieties well bearing cost nothing up to 100 Rial each;so perhaps a fair average price for a Tawi might be 5000 Rial.So countin nothing for supervision,the interest on invested capital in a ^atanah date garden may be about 0.86^ or 25 per fawi per annum.from date Auxiliary crops add to this return.As noted later lucerne can be p profitable,Fruit brings in some thing,though prices are low.Mangoes at Sib were selling at 250 for a Rial last June.Lijaois were selling at about the same price in the VVadi Samayil at the same time. The water hoist used to irrigate the Tawi is of the ordinary Arabian type.The water is about 20 feet below the ground level from Ali Hil to Rumaisj so probably may be at this depth all along the Batanah. The verfciaral supporting hoists are usual lly made of palm logs sawn longitudinally in two. Shey are strong and smooth.In other date producing centres the palm logs are the worst of building wood^for the reason that the internal fibres are loose an and tear out.To plane such a log is like trying to plane a bath lufah Xiie watei is droppeo. from u,ae oucket on to a masonry collecting troug and thence led through a subsidiary bathing tank into the main storag tank. nsvQ it remains until the Bidar has finished ^.oisting.He then unplugs a vent in the tank and occupies himself in distributing the water.lie is drawing water from before the palest streak of dawn to sunrise,and from early afternoon to sunset.Perhaps he and his bull work about seven hours a day at this labour.

It is probale thatbthey are less than below Hub. But the Wadi Samayil though it is certainly the richest in palms of any of the Oaan widyan yet it is only one of the forty such lying between Has Masandam and Kas al Hadd ,and most of those probably contain somenpalms. It is hazardous to conjecture what is the total population of Oman,excluding the coast but 1000000 is a more or lessintelligent guess. If the coastal region be included the number of palms Mght amount to 2,5000000 for date palms grow along the Batanah in a continous belt from ^1 Mil to auhar.Only the iirst twelve miles ol this belt beginning at -^1 J^il vere seen,but sveral and reliable informants state that this portion is typical of the whole. The average width of the palm belt was generally put down at a mile. To allow for pardobable loisal pride half a mile ► has been considered the width ^or the purpose calculation. The lensl lli of the belt of 100 miles is verifiable fro^i the map.Thus the con clusion appeats that the Bitanah date gardens cover 50 square miles# contain probably the third biggest palmery in the world, Basrah \ and Tafililt being bigger. , these necesseriily rough calculations,the number of palms per acre is reckoned at oO.In the Wadi bamayil,the palm are so big that if they were closer that 30 feet to each other the fronfis of neighbouring palms would greatly intermingle.In the Batanah the palms are less vigorous and in the gardens where there aie no fruit tney are frequently at closer intervals. However in consideration of the large number of fruit trees at the southern end of the belt of the bare clearings amongst the palms and of the un» S ult i Vated con&lt;iitlon o? of the Tawian,50 bearing palms per acre | or the whole area is probably not too low.

On the whole planting is less regular than i in the Shatt al ^rab district though in some gardens,the palms are set rightly at the corners of squares,,The uneTeness of the! land may be contributary cause of irregular planting though th&lt; same excuse does not hold for the Batanah, The price of off shoots of most of the comsi mon varieties is twenty or thirty Pai or about 5c each;but i'aradh off shoots command twiipe that.

P/1931. 35, Old Queen Street, London, S.W.I. IZth October, 1931. Sir, With reference to India Office letter No .Z /5522 /31 of September 17th, I am directed by Sir Hilton Young to request that you will be so good as to transmit to His Majesty's Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the accompanying cony of a letter from Mr. Wills of the Mesopotamia Persia Gornoration relative to the Muscat date trade, which formed the subject of Bushire Despatch No.2 Overseas Trade (B) of July ?5th last. for the Comptroller-General. 'Under Secretary of State, India Office.✓ I ] 1612/19?)1 122, Leadenha.ll Street, London, E.G.3. 2nd October, 1931. The Comptroller-General, Department of Overseas Trade, 55, Old Queen Street, S.W.I. Dear Sir, I have to thank you for sending me for my confidential information copy of Mr. Dowson ! s reoort on the subject of da,te cultivation in Muscat, which I have read with great interest. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd., in whom I am interested, have only an Indian in charge at their Muscat office and have, therefore, restricted their I/ activities to steamers agency work at that port. I understand that The Hills Bros. Co., the firm of which [ ■■ p Mr. Dowson is a member, have in the past shipped large quantities of dates from Muscat to America, but in recent years, owing to the quality of the dates having deteriorated, they have reduced the quantity. I am paying my annual visit to Iraq this year and will take up the matter with the head office of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd., in Busreh. Possibly they will arrange, when one of their European staff pays an annual visit to Gulf ports, for him to go into the possibilities of their taking an interest in the Muscat date trade. Yours faithfully, (Sgd. ) CHAS. WILLS.5522^1, DEPAKT!.
