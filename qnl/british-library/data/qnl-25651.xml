Column to occupy Mian Kotal same time as Bushire column reaches Kazernn column to be maintained from Khaneh Zinian. Until the Bushire column leaves Khist no advance to he made beyond Khaneh Zinian. Mohamed Ali Khan and Ehtesham should be induced to maintain such pressure on Soulat ns will prevent him raising men in Dashti and^ moving against my com munications via Abram or threatening the Shiraz-Kazerun road. It is undesirable to accept nelp from these chiefs against Nasi Diwan. End of Summary, 2. The views given above are generally concurred in here regarded as essential to minimise troops in Kazerun Valley for supply reasons whilst maintaining at Mian Kotal an adequate force to deal with unforeseen eventualities. 3 . Kindly telegraph the views of Orton and yourself as to how Mohamed Ali Khan and Ehtesham can best be employed in order to ensure Soulat being neutralised during operations. 4 . The Bushire column is not likely to leave Khist before the first week in November when the General Officer Commanding, Bushire, will assume direction of your column as well as his own and will issue your orders accordingly repeating to India. 5.

I do not think in the present circumstances that anything in the way of a formal invasion by the Bolsheviks probable although small foraging raids on the actual frontier in the Dushak region are always possible. This question has been discussed several times by me with the Governor-General. Military * One change. assistance at present is out of the question as all* our troops are in Trans-Gaspia and I believe there are no regular troops nearer than Eobat direction. We cart only help with arms and money which have been sanctioned. 2 . I stipulated with the Governor-General that condition of gift was that troops to be armed and paid for by us, should be put through some elementary training by our instructors^ as it would be worse than useless to give good arms* to an untrained and undisciplined rabble. Grey tells me to-day that the Gov ernor-General is chary of agreeing to this, purely through sentiment of Persian national pride. I have told Grey, who will inform the Governor-General accordingly, that it is an additional condition and that it cannot be relaxed.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Special Commissioner and Charg6 d’Affaires, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Meshed with request to communicate to General Malleson). The conclusion was reached in the case of telegraphic correspondence between Kerman and Tehran that to arrange for any effective censorship in Tehran was impossible owing to— (1) insufficiency for such of Indo-European Departmental Staff, ( 2 ) our inability, where we are not in military occupation, to enforce it. Unobtrusive censorship, however, is carried out by South Persia Bides at Kerman in collaboration with Persian Telegraph Master who holds up copies of telegrams. Indo-European Department, in virtue of grant of 20,000 rupees a year paid by Indian Government for maintenance of Tehran-Meshed line, keep a British clerk and signaller at Meshed and Tehran, respectively, and for certain periods daily has use of line for transmission of British State telegrams. Line is worked from offices of Persian Telegraphs Administration during remainder of 24 hours. In Tehran, therefore, censorship is not praticable except with con currence of Persian Government which would not be given. Censorship might be established at Meshed similarly to that at Kerman with the aid of local conditions.

Khans did not appear at rendezvous but sent in letter stating they wish to send in emissary and giving no reason for non-appearance. They have been told that they can send an emissary but that, in any case, they must immediately evacuate Chaghadak. That they are playing for time is general impression produced on me, and I do not think that, until they have proof that we really mean business, any advantageous negotiation can take place. Negotiations are not precluded by above order to them. J236 Telegram P., No. 847, dated the 28th (receired 29th) September 1918. From-His Britannic Majtstj’s Chargd d’Affaires and Special Commissioner, Tehran, To-His Excellency the Viceroy (EoreisTn and Political Department), Simla. Following proposals in regard to helping Caucasus, are made by Noel* who has arrived from Baku. General situation was beginning to turn in our favour prior to the evacuation of Baku. Georgians who realised that they had chosen the wrong side wished to set right their mistake. Overtures were being made by certain Muhammadan tribesmen and Andronvik from Erivan was anxious to co-operate. Bolshevism was on the wane in Northern Caucasus, and the Terekh Cossacks w*ere requesting our aid. Force of Bieharakoff was making good. Alexief with a considerable following was endeavouring to provide a much needed link on the Volga between Czeeho-Slovaks and Cossacks. Great set-back to our plans is caused by fall of Baku, but we should not be deterred bv it from an effort to later on get back there, meanwhile fostering further development of existing favourable situation. Following measures suggest themselves:— ( 1 ) Control of the Caspian to be maintained. (2) Material and financial support for Bicharakoff, also for, if it comes under his orders, the Caspian Fleet. ( 3 ) Maintenance amongst the Russian settlers on the Moghan Steppe of our military mission. ( 4 ) Communication with Gronsi oil-field and petroleum springs to be opened up, so as to be able to draw for supplies of petrol and oil-fuel on that field. (5) Appointment of an officer at Slmsha to promote sabotage on Baku- Tiflis Railway and to keep in touch with Andronik. ( 6 ) Despatch to Mozdok of officers to endeavour to effect escape from Vladikavkas of Caucasus Military Mission. (7) Despatch to Alexief and Cossack Governments of Prussian officers. ( 8 ) Entrance into relations with mountain tribes of the Caucasus and Georgians, promising them to use our friendIv offices to procure for them a measure of self-government which wdli give them scope to develop in accord ance with their religious and national ideals at Peace Conference. (9) Establishment at some centre in Caucasus of British Bank to aocept deposits guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government and repayable in roubles. It is suggested that to deal with the political as well as the military problems raised and to carry out this programme that, from personnel of late Dunsterforce and Caucasus military agencies we should form a Mission, petro leum springs being its headquarters. Special attention is drawn by Noel to question of Russian small arms ammunition supplies. No sources of supply are available, abundant evidence of stocks existing at time of the revolution have now disappeared and produc tion has long ceased. r ! he friendly element in Caucasus, South-West Russia and Trans-Caspia, however this may he, cannot he expected to take any effec tive action unless we can provide them with ammunition, for which tliey are clamouring. Information as to in what quantity Russian small arms ammunition can be supplied from England or America and wliat the military authorities can provide on the Baghdad-Enzeli line in the way of future transport facilities is important. Addressed to the Foreign Office; repeated Baghdad,237 Telegram P., No. 104-j dated the SOfch September (received 1st October) 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Tehran and Bushire, copy to Sykes). That my first telegram should be a protest I regret, 'in The telegrams sent to Sykes “ for personal information of himself, Orton and Harvey ” (ne has considered himself precluded from giving me copy of these telegrams or even permitting me to see any but one) ha* been the only information received here about the Bushire plan of operations. . But, as Ms telegram referred to shows, considerations involved are almost entirely political and it is clear that from this end proposed operations will be far more political than military in character. I cannot exercise political control vested in Consul or even ffive fullv reasoned advice if I am kept in the dark. ' ^ -vr i which I have seen says Douglas considers presence of Mahomet Ah Khan in neighbourhood of Kazerun undesirable. Not only will his co-operation there be invaluable but without alienating him it will be impossible to keep him away and I venture to press this j&gt;oint. , ^ v If ^ fl l 0 iIl doia ^ i what 116 considers his personal or tribal interests demand &lt; he is prevented he may upset plan of operations by an independent attack on Kazerun, or may turn against us. We do not want to see him holding that place but he can most profitably be used in holding back people of Kazerun from joining in resistance to Dougdas and blocking road for Darashurris. Uttajar (?) intrigues against Mahomet Ah can probably be counteracted secretly by Minister. Dash tar jin is the key point at this end of road not Khaneh Zinian Gough and i consider, and, as soon as military considerations permit, we should in my opinion, occupy Dashtarjin. This refers to Sykes’ telegram, 736—17.0 with which Gough and I concur. . •? 238 Telegram P., dated the 30th September (received 1st October) 1918.

Telegram P., No. X.-736-2-G., dated the 7th (received 10th) September 1918. From—S ir Percy Sykes, Shiraz, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. • Your X.-70072—M. O. 1, September 3rd (received 6 th). The following is Orton’s appreciation. Ayaz Kikha is hostile and with perhaps 1,000 Darashuris is at Simarun near Abadeh. These Darashuris have been refused Asylum by the Bakhtiari, and they will probably migrate to Behbehan during October by a route well west of (group omitted ? Shiraz) instead of by the usual route taken by them via Khaneh Zinian. The father-in-law of Ehtesham, Kalantar Ahmed Khan is also near Abadeh with Shishbulukis; he renders obedience to Ehtesham and has opposed Ayaz Kikha and rebel Soper at that place. The Shishbulukis will migrate to Earashband via Shiraz in October. Ali Khan, lllbegi, is moving towards Simarun with a Kashgai following and can prevent interference by Ayaz Kikha against us and may win him over to side of Ehtesham. Eiruzabad is held by Ehtesham with a Kashgai follow ing and he has at that place two Soper maxims and one Section Soper artillery with two old Austrian mountain guns. Soulat is in Qir-Okarzin about 50 miles south-east Eiruzabad; he has a following of about 1,500 men, mostly Amaleh and Earsi Maidan and some Kashqulis under Abdul Eath Khan. The Lari Mullah is preaching on behalf of Soulat at Jahrun, but without definite success. At hiruzabad there is a section of Kasqulis under Muhammad Ali Khan. Soulat and Nasr Divan deprived Muhammad Ali Khan of large properties around Kazerun and as a consequence the latter is bitterly hostile towards these two, and will certainly co-operate against Nasr. At Kazerun, a strong party, perhaps half of the local inhabitants, is hostile to Nasr and his Earashbashi Muhammad Ibrahim and when Indian troops advance they would possibly side with Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashquli. The following troops could be used jbr the Shiraz Column, viz. ( 1 ) Burma Mounted Rifles, 3 Squadrons plus Squadron 27th Cavalrv attached 3—121itk Baluchis. J ( 2 ) Half battalion, 16th Rajputs. (3) 36th Reserve Indian Mountain Battery. (4) 1 Squadron, Soper Cavalry. (5) 1 Company, Soper Infantry. Total fighting strength of this column about 2 500. By this there would be left at Shiraz the following Squadron, 26th Cavalry. Half battalion, 16th Rajputs. i aaa t j . tne column units o 1,000 Indian troops m addition to 800 (?) Soper at Shiraz. Olllrl Tip frwll/^Txrn r Phases would be as follows ; 1st. Occupation of Khaneh Zenian and formation Base Depot there. 2nd .—Advance to Mian Kotal. 3rd.—Advance to Kazerun. of AdvancedDuring 1st phase no opposition is anticipated. During the second, opposition would be prevented by the co-operation of Muhammad Aii Khan, Kashquli. A s operations of Bushire Column would prevent reinforcements reaching Kazerun from South opposition by Kazerunis during third phase would be overcome. Between Shiraz and Mian Kotal there are no local supplies. 1 st phase would take three weeks, the 2 nd phase about three days and the 3 rd about two days, dhe possibilities are that Nasr Divan and his Barash band would flee or be captured by their enemies and made over to us. The main opposition is likely to be encountered by Bushire Column. An alternative plan to above would be for the Shiraz Column to proceed to Biruzabad and thence on Kazerun via Jireh thus avoiding the difficult Kotals between Khaneli Zenian and Kazerun. This route, 179 miles as against 7 b via Khaneh Zenian but there are more supplies on it. The Khaneh Zenian route has my preference as, by it, it would be easier to ensure co-operation with Bushire Column. End of Orton s appreciation with which I agree. Dependence can be placed on Ehtesham’s co-operation as in order to strengthen himself vis-a-vis Soulat he desires the eviction of Nasr Divan and he (Ehtesham) owes his appointment to us and is dependent on us to maintain him against Soulat. In order to regain his properties around Kazerun Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashquli, will co-operate with us. Political details can be held up pending arrival of Hotson next week. Barman Parma will be very pleased to regain control over Kazerun, to appoint a Deputy Governor and to regain these local revenues although he will be afraid of what the Persian Government may put up in way of protest. Passes are liable to be closed by snow from beginning of December. 241 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 13065, dated the 26tli September 1918.)

(Omission) and I consider that arrangements can be made for pressure against Soulat to be continued by Ehtesham and Muhammad Ali Khan from Eht^sham’s base at Eiruzabad.

The column moved out this morning at 2-30 a. m. Our advanced cavalry were heavily tired on from trenches outside Chaghadak but the enemy fled before the infantry attack developed. Chagbadak and Ali Cbangi were occupied by 8-30 A. m. and 11 a. m., respectively. Enemy’s casualties uncertain but five bodies were found and* two wounded captured.

Malleson and I agree that censorship of telegraph is desirable. Governor- General agreed as to desirability, and informed me that neither he nor Persian Government could give official sanction hut he added that we could do what we liked and that he would not protest unless obliged to by Tehran in which case we could ignore his protest. I have asked Kerman by telegraph for details of their arrangement there and staff employed. Following are the hours during which lines here are worked by Persian or international offices :— (1) Eastern line, 8 to 10 A. M. and 1 to 3 p. m.

Consul-General, Shiraz, should be kept fully informed by telegram of all developments in situation. Consul will continue to exercise political control in Shiraz itself under Minister as heretofore, but he should be regarded as on your staff as Political Officer for northern section in regard to operations on Bushire-Shiraz road, and, for this purpose, should work with Officers Commanding Columns moving from Shiraz in direct communication. As regards presence of Muhammad Ali Khan in the neighbourhood of Kazerun, it is thought that any attempt to prevent him from moving to Kazerun against his will might alienate him and lose his valuable co operation. This should please be considered further in communication with Consul,, Shiraz.

Q 1 Telegram P., No 856, dated the 1st (received 2nd) October 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Charge d’Affaires and Special Commissioner, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Assumption in first paragraph is correct. Good|use has since been made of news of the victory in Palestine but, for its effect on public to be judged, it is too early yet. As far as concerns Ministers and Shah, their apprehen sions of any further Turkish advance in immediate future have been consider ably relieved by it. The visit of Chief of the General Staff, Baghdad, who, here yesterday, was able to tell Prime Minister that as result of Allenhy’s victory no less than one-third of Turkish forces in Persia and Caucasus were being withdrawn westwards and that our own garrisons at Zinjan, Enzeli, &amp;c., had been reinforced and were now confident of their ability to maintain their positions, has also had the same effect. I note as to proposed concessions ( 1 ) and (’2) are accepted. As regards (3) it might be stated, I suggest, that transfer of South Persia Rifles will be made to Parman Parma as soon as two Governments are satisfied that security and general condition of Province and safety of foreign representatives and interests are assured by Parman Parma’s arrangements and that Bushire- Shiraz trade route Kazerun is open to traffic. In connection with commis sion of neutral officers, there will be no objection to Prench-Swiss. May I say that in regard to their selection we shall claim to be consulted ? A great point was made by Ministers of their being able to make known in order to convince public of our serious intentions, intention to form this cornmission. At the time I explained that it would be inconvenient during war to have the commission here but in reply they urged that selection and journey to Tehran of officers would in any case take long time and statement to public was the essential thing. If we were to agree to take leisurely steps for selection and despatch of commission by exchange of semi-official notes would it suffice ? We could stipulate in any case that until end of war or until we consent to their going neutral officers should not be sent to South. They would, mean while, have plenty to do in North in drawing up their scheme and dealing with Northern Gendarmerie who, though they are much under-officered, are now commanded by Swedes. Since my telegram of September 23rd, I have had no further discussions with Ministers on above questions and before resuming them your reply will be awaited. With reference to suggestion for recognition of zone or line across which parties would not operate. Point emphasised by you was appreciated fully and Ministers were warned specifically that it would not be possible for us to withdraw our troops in any case for that reason. I regret to learn, however, that without consulting me further Persian Government in moment of panic have protested to Constantinople at the soil of Persia, and specially neighbour hood of capital, being invaded thus and urging withdrawal of Turks from Persian territory and saying they would urge us to do the same if they comply.— The understanding between Ministers and myself was tliat they should discuss ns necessary, proposals with Shah and Cabinet and I should approach Government and that we should resume negotiations then. Prune Minister explained in reply to my remonstrances-that what had occurred was that Governor-General,^Tabriz,* who has recently been expelled by Turks and arrived here, brought to Cabinet and Shah alarming reports to effect that Turks would be here within a month having every intention of advancing on Tehran in force and matters seemed to be so urgent that no time was to be lost hence despatch of this protest was decided upon. Persian Government, he continued, had done the same before two or three times and it did not seem to him that our pourparler enhanced prejudice in any way as it did net commit us in any way. I fully understand there can be no question pt our ■withdrawing although I am sorry that this should have occurred. However, as far as Kermanshah-Enzeli line is concerned, would it not be feasible, to agree npon a zone which would not be crossed by parties. This refers to your telegram of September 27th, No. 511. Addressed Foreign Office, London. 2 Telegram P., No. 857, dated the 1st (received 2nd) October 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires and Special Commissioner, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. See telegram from Trooper, dated September 25th, No. 67118, to General, Baghdad. Copy of the telegram reached me simultaneously with your telegram of September 27th, No. 511. Perhaps former was drafted before the portent of victory in Palestine was fully apparent, but in view of the opinion expressed therein as to the desirability of Persia entering the lists on our side, following is appreciation of the position as it appears to me, which I venture to offer. Bringing Persia in presents no difficulty, provided th.at certain essential conditions as stated below can be satisfied; but her sole motive for coming would be in order to appear at the Peace Conference as a belligerent with the hope of getting her independence guaranteed internationally and also of receiving, as compensation for injuries suffered, a slice of Turkish territory iu the neighbourhood of the frontier. As a belligerent Persia would be sleeping partner and we should be expected to do the business. Preliminary conditions would be as stated below :— ( 1 ) That we should convincingly demonstrate that we have, on the Enzeli line, sufficient force to cope with any concentration enemy might be able to bring against us and to prevent any further incursion into Persian territory. ( 2 ) That we should supply her with the necessary funds in rifles, guns, bullion, clothing, munitions and equipment. A week ago we were not in a position to satisfy first condition but, as result of Palestine victory, we may possibly be now. Second we could not satisfy either then or now so far as I can see. We should derive following advantages from Persia coming in with us : ( 1 ) Moral effect of event in India and Afghanistan. ( 2 ) Certainly that she will not come in as an enemy. (3) We should be in a more favourable position in many ways, such as improvement of communications and control of telegraphs,,First advantage still holds good, second is partly achieved by Allenhy’s victory. By her coming in we suffer disadvantages as follows :— The only element Persia possesses of which military use could be forth with made would be-— (1) Starosselski and his Cossacks, and (2) Bakhtiari and a few other small tribal contingents. Neither of these would he of much military value. Starosselski has already increased his brigade to a division of 6,000 men and has declared that he can speedilv, if necessary, increase it to 12,000. He would, therefore, play the leading role and at the end of the war would be left with a powerful armed fnree which would, in accordance with his declared ambition, enable him to maintain Russia’s time-honoured footing in North Persia. ' The Bakhtiaris, who, so long as employed in their own country or on the borders, can be very useful to us and at the same time innocuous, would be able to train and arm some thousands of their tribesmen and rule them in and around Tehran. On the termination of the war they would be left in a very strong position to dominate the political position in Tehran. Thus we should be strengthening (and entirely at our own expense) the two elements which, so far as I can see, if after the war policy in Persia is to be a success and our influence in Tehran predominant we shall least want to encourage. Disadvantages, therefore, seem clearly to predominate though above estimate of the pros and cons is just one. Addressed to Foreign Office, London, and repeated to Political Resident, Baghdad. 3 .

The British Government recognises in principle the propriety of affording the Trans-Caspian Government financial assistance for the purpose of carrying on the war for the joint aims set forth in paragraph one of this Protocol. The amount and method of payment to be matters tor further discussion between the two Governments, it being agreed that whenever such payments be made a financial representative of the British Government shall be attached to the Trans-Caspian Government and shall have, with the latter Government, joint control over disbursements made from any free grants*in-aid by the British Government. 6 («).

On behalf of the British Government I guarantee the continuance of military and financial assistance so long as your Government maintains itself in power and has as the main plank in its political platform the restoration of order and the suppression of all Bolshevik or Turco-German intrigues cr projects for invasion. 4 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 13017, dated the 25th September 1918.)

The following telegram which passed through Meshed last night en route from Tehran to Askabad has come into my possession. It is to the Askabad Government from the Russian Legation and is signed Jonkovski Begins. “ Situation is rather more revolutionary, we refused to recognise the Bolshevik Government and so cut ourselves off from funds, Tiflis parlia ment supported us for some months as we recognised them. Lately we vereable to get a sum of money* which did not go far to pay our debts, from the Baku dictatorship. “ By strict economy we cut down our monthly bill on mission and Con sulate to 20,000 tomans, though before October 1917 we spent 50,000 tomans monthly on this. “Will the Askabad Government guarantee, for the next six months, our expenses at the rate of 20,000 tomaus monthly. We ask this in view of the fact that the sum we previously asked you for, namely, two million roubles monthly, is now worth only three quarters of what it was when we mentioned it, owing to the fall of the value of roubles. “ Now when such important questions as regards Persia and Russia are being decided, Russian influence was never more in need of assistance to get above water. “The next six months will decide the fate of Russia as regards Bolsheviks. ” Ends. Paragraph —With reference to the above message. Certainly neither the Russian Consulate here nor, from what I have seen from messages, the legation at Tehran are in the least helpful and 1 would point out that sooner or later any payment made by the Askahad Government will devolve on us and I do not think it would be good value lor our money. All these people seem to look forward to a time when the greater part of Persia will again be under the Russian heel, and in our dealings with Trans- Caspia, their wholly reactionary sentiments are the reverse of helpful. They are like the Bourbons, in asmuch as they have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. If the Russian Consulate and Bank here were compelled from want of funds to close down, it would, in my opinion, be entirely in our interests. Railing a hint from me to the contrary, it is not unlikely that the Trans- Caspian Government, in spite of impending bankruptcy nevertheless, will provide the money asked for because individuals lately emerged from obscurity are flattered by the obsequious solicitations of Russian diplomats and not so much from patriotic motives. I was informed by the Russian Bank manager here, whom I saw to-day regarding scare-mongering, that on learning of the fall of Baku Nikolski, Russian Consul, said that in two weeks’ time the Turks would be here. The scare amongst Russian community reported in my P0547, September 19th, was probably due tflis statement. 5 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 13017, dated the 25th September 1918.)

From— Sykes, Shiraz, To-The Chief of the General Staff, Simla (repeated Minister, Tehran, and General Officer Commanding, Bushire). Ayaz Kikha with his Darashulis is in Bakhtiari country. Ordinarily, their line of migration to Behbehan passed near Khaneh Ziman and Kazerun, but in order to avoid Indian troops they will take a more westward course, it necessary. If our operations are much delayed, Darashulis after reaching Behbehan would send a contingent vid Kazerun to aid Soulat, Darasbuiis would probably submit if we occupy Kazerun by November. Ah Khan, lllbecri, with Sbishbulukis will leave Abadeh Sarhad early m October and migrate vid Shiraz valley towards Piruzabad reaching that place m Novembei. Muhammad Khan Hutabr, brother-in-law of Muhammed Ali Khan, kashquli, has died of wounds which he received in fighting against Soulat. Muham* mad Ali Khan is pressing Barman Earma for permission to leave Piruzabad with his 400 Kasbqulis to proceed to Kashquli tribes, summer headquarters at Ardan, 45 miles north of Khaneh Zinian, to settle Kashquli affairs upset by Hutabr’s death and arrange migration. It is regarded by Earman Earma to be impolitic and almost impossible to deny permission to Muhammad All Khan. Part of Kashgais, adherents of Ehtesbam,, numbering 1,000 families, are summering at Baiza, three marches north-west of Shiraz. Earman Barma is arranging for these to migrate towards Biruzabad at once sending about 400 fighting men ahead to join Ehtesham, and that Muhammad Ali Khan shall remain with Ehtesham until these arrive. To-day Earman Earmaasked me to send 100 South Persia Rifles infantry and 25 South Persia Rifles cavalry under Persian officers to reinforce South Persia Rifles detachment already with Ehtesham at Piruzabad. The Consul concurs in tlie advisability of this, and South Persia Rifles reinforcements will leave Shiraz on October 1 st, arriving Piruzabad about October 4th. The outline of the proposed operations have been explained by me to the Consul^ so that he may arrange necessary political measures with Ehtesham and others. Muhammad Ali Khan ia anxious to attack Nasr Divan and recover his property around Shapur and Kazerun. Both Farman Farma and Consul consider it will be difficult to furnish 1 Muhammad Ali Khan with good reasons why he should refrain attacking Kasr, and I agree. Muhammad Ali Khan was whole-heartedly on our side against Soulat and any ancient misdeeds should be obliterated by his recent good services. To baulk the desire of Muhammad Ali Khan to co-operate against Nasr will not promise well for future peace along the Kazerun road, whereas co-operation in fighting for our mutual advantage is likely to result in good prospect of increased friendship in the future. The influence of Muin ut Tujjar at Tehran is likely to be used against Muhammad Ali Khan, because Soulat handed some villages of Muhammad Ali Khan on the edge of Mamasani country over to Muin ut Tujjar, who would oppose their recovery by Muhammad Ali Khan. This telegram is concurred in by the Consul. 14 Telegram R., No. H.-3, dated the 2nd (received 3rd) October 1918. From—The General Officer Commanding, Bushiro, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla (repeated to Tehran and Sykes). Sykes’ telegram, 736—I7-G., raises issues of far-reaching importance neces sitating consideration of general policy to be adopted by this force in dealing with the tribes. This should, in my opinion, be, broadly speaking, the following in view of extremely favourable turn of the European war there seems to be good grounds for hoping that after the occupation of Kazerun, junction with Orton and establishment of double line of supply to Shiraz, we shall be in a very strong position, able to impose any system of road control which may be adopted by His Majesty’s Government after full consideration of ail the factors. Any system which is to have hope of permanency must be based on such factors in Fars politics as are themselves permanent to the exclusion of sentimental considerations such as gratitude or resentment for past actions. In any case all services appear to have been adequately recompensed in cash. I am, therefore, anxious that when the junction is effected my hand should be free to deal with the situation as far as possible unhampered by personal obligations of any kind and for this reason I am generally opposed to all proposals for requesting or accepting assistance from individual tribal chiefs other than responsible Illkhani. In the present question regarding Muhammad Ali Khan my views are as follows:— It is essential that the (Ilkhani P) should understand that his primary duty at present is the suppression or at least complete restraint of Soulat and that his ultimate retention as Illkhani absolutely depends on his success in this task. If he thinks that this can: be done without the active assistance of Muhammad Ali Khan, and if Governor-General concurs, I see nothing for it but to let him go, but they must both understand the serious responsibility they incur. In this connection I should be interested to learn to which section the other families from Baiza belong; if to the Amalah , the H reliability is most problematical. If Muhammad Ali Khan must leave Feruzabad, I consider— ’w? (a) that he should leave a contingent behind as continued hostility to Soulat; a guarantee of his(b) that it would be best for him to go to Ardehao direct; (c) that, if he is extremely anxious to do so, he may be permitted to re occupy Shahpur, to which he has claims; (d) that he should be formally prohibited by the Governor-General from attacking (? Kazerun) on the ground that if hostilities are in progress when the troops arrive there will be a great danger for all parties on account of difficulty of distinguishing between friend and foe. Consequently no tribal fighting can be allowed on the line of march. I lay great stress on this and would ask for the decision of the question, if necessary, by higher authority. His failure in this enterprise would give strong stimulus to all anti- British elements, and his success would place us on arrival there in an embarrassing position of apparent obligation to a man who, whatever his temporary attitude may be, is not likely to be a permanent force on the side of law and order. It is no doubt this prospect which makes him so anxious to attack before we come. Chief Political Officer and I entirely in accord in the views expressed above.

Copies of telegrams referred to were received on afternoon of September 29th and files have since been shown to me. Sykes explains he preferred to postpone showing them until after Gough had left. After consultation with staff telegrams relating to Mahomet Ali Khan and Dashtarjin were sent and I thought were in accordance with the staff's accepted views. I did not show draft to Sykes before despatch by an over sight and I understand now that he does not attach so much importance to an early occupation of Dashtarjin as do Gough and myself although he agrees about Mahomet Ali.

With the general principles advocated we are inclined to agree but your views are awaited.

Nortliern road is relapsing into anarchy in absence of settled arrangements. That first forty miles at least should be put in order to permit supplies being brought to Shiraz from Persian country to north is essential. Governor- General is willing to retain road in his hands and is being pressed by PersianGovernment to do so. His scheme is practicable in my opinion though not in Sykes*. If, however, it is decided, in accordance with proposals already made, that Sykes should take charge of road, Bis Highness desires that this should be done at once. If Chief of the General Staff approves, Sykes is ready to send out sufficient force of South Persia Rifles with small backing of Indian troops as far as Kinareh and to take over Tufangchis now on road north of that place. r lhis arrangement is accepted by His Highness. Tufangchis have been paid up to September 30th. Early orders; request ed. This telegram has been seen by Sykes. 21 Telegram P., No. 169, dated the 6th (received 7th) October 191?.

Three main objects comprise our policy :— ( 1 ) to open road for trade ; ' ( 2 ) as soon as possible to restore civil government under Governor- General and Darya Begi; (3) to withdraw as many as possible Indian troops. It is also desired— (4) to catch Wassmuss and punish certain oftending Khans ; (5) achievement of all this with as little fighting as possible and prevention of bitterness subsequently. With regard to ( 2 ) suitable persou has already been selected by Governor- General as Deputy Governor of Kazerun and his installation without any interregnum should be included in our plan of operations. With regard to (3) that some Indian troops will be required to garrison points on road for some time is recognised. With reference to (5) we should avail ourselves as much as possible of Farman Earma’s assistance and co-operation of tribes. Governor-General can without in any tying our hands as regards anyone we wish to punish, mani pulate the tribes. With permission of Barman Earma, Mahomet Ali Khan left Ehtesham when South Persia Rifles* contingent arrived and is expected here on October 9 th. About October 15th he will reach Ardakan, but owing to increasing cold he cannot stay there long. He will move south-west before end of month. Trouble with Darashuris now improbable. Early in November, he may reach Shapur neighbourhood and he will, if Bushire force continues to advance probably have little difficulty in occupying his possessions there. There is no chance since death of his cousin, Mahomet Khan, that he will come to term* with Soulat; we do not treat v\ith him as.au independent chief; he takes his orders from Earman Earma and Ebtesham. Tribal fighting near line of march will not be permitted by Governor- General. Possibility that Nasr-i-Divan may take to hills and leave Kazerun undefended is danger to be guarded against. Should he do this Mahomet Ali Khan by a coup de main might seize Kazerun. This would be most inconvenient for Earman Earma as well as (group undecipherable) and Gover nor-General will formally prohibit him but if Kazerun were left vacant for long he might be hard to hold. It is possible Nasr will refuse battle till Bushire force nears Kazerun and put up a good fight there but it is necessary for us to be prepared to occupy Kazerun promptly in view of other contin gency. If physical difficulties and distance prevent Bushire force from doing so, Shiraz torce should be ready to. It could do so from Dashtarjiu, occupation of which will be considered again when advance base at Khan eh Zinian is formed as you desire. Several advantages would accrue from early occupation of Kazerun by either force; — ( 1 ) because of increasing cold on northern passes in December; ( 2 ) reduction of period for which heavy subsidies must be paid to Kashgais under Ehtesham; (3) it would free Shiraz troops to put north road in order; (4) reduction of transport required for Shiraz garrison and release of transport for other purposes; (5) Establishment of Governor-General’s Governorship. imi ; V i . id S ilOIA F'VXJGH $£Ciifr-- &gt; !rrS 4 i&amp;UfcT. hf. ii*i1 JW 78 3 18 OCT 1318 j 20 eoV' 1313 i 'X.,That he cannot maintain himself as Tllkhani unless Soulat is finally defeated, -Fhfc^ham is well aware. He may be able to follow Soulat towards Kazerim hat this is still uncertain. Parman Parma anticipates that Soulat will annroach Bill for terms. He will probably pm Nasr at Kazerun if he does not do so. Our best chance of catching them, in ^ these circumstances, will be to have Ehtesbam ready on east and Mahomet Ali Khan on west. Pour hundred of Amalah, who are loyal to Ehtesham and 600 Isrdar, and other small tribes who have all declared for him, comprise the 1,000 families at Baiza.

During last two months, some 16,000 loads of British goods have arrived at Shiraz and great accumulation at Kazerun has practically all been moved. Road has been guarded by 120 sowars and Tufangchis. “That one can arrange things better by politics than by force”, Parman Parma considers he has proved.

Recent defeats of the Debashgais and Kazerunis near Shiraz and concentrations of the Indian troops at Bushire and Shiraz alarmed Nasr Diwan. Farman Farma by promises to Nasr Diwan, which he has no idea of keeping, induced Nasr Diwan to forward accumulated goods. Nasr Diwan and tufangehis of Farman Farma levy blackmail on every load. Hence success of party under ephemeral circumstances which are unlikely to obtain in future. On October 8 th Nasr Diwan closed road to all traffic.

From— His Britannic Majest/s Charge d’Affaires and Special Commissioner, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Clear the line. It may be opportune for you to receive an appreciation of the Tehran situation at the present juncture. There lias been a severe influenza epidemic for the past three weeks to which the Shah fell a victim last Saturday and which prevented me from having an audience. Prime Minister is now among the convalescents. ,The Cabinet’s position is becoming weaker daily. The only three mem bers who carry any weight are the Prime Minister, Parman Parma’s son and Mushaver-ul-Mamalek, the Poreign Minister. Ihere is no doubt that the latter is working for his own hand against Vossuq and cannot be trusted either by him or us. Remainder of Cabinet carries no weight with the public. The position of Cabinet is shaky in consequence and Vossuq is not in a position at present to give us any more overt co-operation in military matters. Nor has he any results to show which would strengthen his position with the public. There was an inclination to discredit the favourable trend of affairs in Europe at first. Now, however, it is recognised and causes general rejoicing. One of its effects is to make everybody, a few irreconcilables alone excepted, feel that Anglophil, Turcophil, Germanophil, will soon cease to have any meaning, and the fact is generally realised that rapprochement with England is essential in Persia’s interests. The hope is general that England is going to take a more friendly line in the future. My own translation from Iraq with a friendly reputation is taken primdfacie as a hopeful sign. So far, so good. All this however does not tend to make Vossuq’s position easier. On the one hand, there are many moderates who feel that they may now hope to partake of the loaves and fishes. On the other hand, the Cabinet is generally looked upon as packed, put in by our insistence, and unable to last long on its own merits. I have incidentally reason to believe that Staroselski is working against Vossuq. He is personally hostile to him and is wielding a good deal of influence with the Shah and others. In my opinion therefore Vossuq needs to strengthen the personnel of his Cabinet in any case ; and if possible we should expedite the issue of friendly announce ment of policy in return for more frank co-operation. Some pamphleteering is going on with the object of ousting Earman * (F) Tbe lute Governor-General of Kerman. ?! ar “ a - Iti , &gt; S Probably engineered by fehah s uncle* who covets his post. I am assured by Prime Minister that his Cabinet has no such idea and I shall put it to the Shah when I see him. Retention of His Highness should, I assume, be a sine qua non of any friendly action in connection with Ears we may decide to take.

He paid one thousand gold Ashrafis to Samsam-es- Saltanah for appointment and more money was paid on that account by Amir Khan and another in Tehran both of Kalantars families. Sirdar Jang has also supported him very strongly partly on account of his Dizful estates and partly as a lever to annoy Shaikh of Mohammerah. New Governor is poor and out to make some money and leave as soon as he has collected a substantial sum, but his sentiments are with old regime in Tehran. If permitted to start work counter to us he will soon backed by Khans and will then be a source of great worry to us. Above information has been communicated to me a few days ago by a Bakhtiari friend on whom I rely and confirmed by Farid-es-Sultaaeh who travelled from Tehran with Governor. Enclosure No. 16.

Administration is poor in places, cancel appointment head police it would be better to cancel that of Assistant Governor, Shushtar, Deputy and head police, Dizfu], and these persons be recalled to Tehran.

From— General Malleson, Meshed, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Khorasan. The following considerations are submitted :— (1) As has been reported on frequent occasions, enemy agents have been Tery active throughout the province and all round it. The present Turkish advance on Kasvin and possibly Tehran, their final efforts on Baku, the Bol shevik descent on Krasnovodsk and the Bolshevik invasion from Turkistan have all been freely prophesied. Two w r eeks ago had a report that pro-Turks were for asserting that by next November every British soldier would have been driven south of Khorasan. (2) There are within and close to the province various potentially turbu lent elements. The Yamuts are being stirred up. The Shahrud-Astarabad area is chaotic. The attitude of the Governor of Bujnurd is uncertain. The Herat* Governor has just sent a truculent *i change. note to the Governor-Geneial here. To save the situation in Trans-Caspia we have sent almost all our troops there, that being the greater danger. Consequently in the event of local disturbances; engineered by hostile agents and supported by the local pro-lurks Persian. Bolsheviks, democrats and the personal enemies of the Governor-General, we have practically no forces available to meet them and our line of communica tion which is both long and vulnerable and on which all depends, might be seriously interfered with. i (3) Grey is absolutely confident in the friendship and good faith of the Governor-General and as far as my experience goes I concur with him. He has, at our request, promptly removed provincial Governors who are suspected of being pro-Turks or anti-British and he has helped me in other important matters which are not necessary to—bw, upecial here. He has assured me repeatedly that his fixed determination is to quell any disturbances ^ or anti-British demonstrations in the province and to repel any hostile invasion from without; but he requires arms and money to do this. (4) I understood that the recommendations to give both has been sent to London; but in the meanwhile the possibility of the emergency is rapidly advancing on us, and I strongly urge that the decision should no longer be delayed. There are risks of course in giving arms to Persia but I think they must be accepted since in my opinion the other risks enumerated above are much more formidable. (5) I therefore suggest that I should be empowered to hand over to the Governor-General 500 of the 2,000 rifles shortly to reach me with 200 rounds per rifle and that the money grant already proposed to London should be given now, both of these gifts • to be purely personal and if the present Governor-General should vacate office and arms ammunition to be returned. (6) These arms can be spared for the present without detriment to the other schem'es which cannot fully nature for some time. In the meantime the arms and ammunition might be replaced from India. (7) I am aware that this question has hitherto been a matter dealt with by the Poreign Department, but as military issues have now become so pressing I recommend that action as’above be taken forthwith and Grey agrees.

Paragraph 1 .—A new delegate, Count Dorev, arrived from Askabad to-day. Though noble he has always been a Social Democrat and was imprisoned in Siberia under old regime. He is a leading member of “ Turkistan Union ” which has now come out into the open and the Askabad Government is practically dominated by them. Their policy, though aiming not to alienate workmen, is to obtain on their side elements such as the ear- officer class and intelligent class, who have hitherto been largely spectators in the Bolshevik-Menshevik struggle. Paragraph 71.-1 was told by Dorev that they were raising a corps, composed mainly of ear-officers and cadets, from 500 to 1,000 strong. This •orps they proposed, with our aid, to train, arm and equip. Paragraph JI7.—He also dwelt at length on their policy regarding Turcomans, amongst whom he admitted were numerous German and Turkish Agents. The policy, I suggested some time ago, has been adopted by his party, viz., of using Kirghiz North-Central Asian Railway as counterpoise to Turcomans. My proposal to utilise Kurds, if necessary, against Yamuts is also endorsed by him. Paragraph IV’. On behalf of his Government he particularly requested I should proceed to Askabad, if only for a few days, as there were many important matteis lequiriog consideration. I am of opinion that on many grounds quite apart from Askabad Government, it is very necessary for me to visit Trans-Caspia. Such a visit would entail at present 5 days’ journey by road, each coming and going, and say one week’s stay in Trans-Caspia in order to visit both Krasnovodsk and Kaahka. Close on three weeks in all. tI should be in touch with telegraph for plain messages at Kuchan and for ciphers also in Trans-Caspia. Redl would remain for all ordinary work.

The Governor can, with dignity, hardly avoid calling upon Ghazanfar, if he does make overtures, to disperse armed force with which peace of the neigh’ bourhood is being threatened by him, and it would clearly be necessary that troops should occupy the place in the event of refusal. In the event suggested, I strongly recommend sanction to latter measures. Prom Chahkutu proclamation could then be issued.

If the control of northern road is to be assumed by Sykes in December and southern road earlier, continuance of Governor-General’s scheme which as reported in my telegram, 93, would take three months to get into working order is not worth while in my opinion. His Highness is therefore being advised by me to discontinue his preparations which were in train. The Tufangchis which he has already collected he can post at one or two places on the road where robberies are of frequent occurrence. Colonel Williams, on return of Abadeh relief column, can continue to guard the rest of road. These men will be supplemented by Governor-General’s Tufangchis as stated above and should be sufficient to prevent serious trouble on road for interval before South Persia Rifles’ control is re-established.

Provided that his scheme was adopted latter was ready to accept full responsibility for safety of traffic. As road will be guarded by Tufangchis appointed by South Persia Rifles in interval between now and resumption of control by South Persia Rifles, it would not be fair in my opinion to put ri sponsibility on^ Governor-General, Sykes is also w ill ing to temporarily resume control with lufangchis now on road and His Highness who assures me that he will suve every assistance in his power, is willing to place control in his hands. These road guards, however, it should be thoroughly understood, should not interfere in any way with internal direction of country. Sykes should, therefore, I recommend, again at once take over control making, pending more permanent arrangements, such arrangements as he considers necessary.

It is obvious that object of outlaw Khans in coming down is to surrender and come to terms and that their armed following is only a precaution that is customary. Everything calculated to lead their armed following to commit any foolish action should be avoided and every opportunity should be given6 them to make surrender. Possibility of overtures will probably be precluded if immediate disbandment of following is demanded. W&amp;„j 2 mst avoid a campaign of Khan hunting at all costs. Overtures should be accepted in spirit already clearly indicated to you, and you should proceed to negotiate in a sensible way unless such overtures are contdmacious or otherwise really Unacceptable.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires and Special Commissioner, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. At two or three meetings, very frank and full discussion of situation has taken place between myself, the Prime Minister and Nasrat Dowleh, his prin cipal ally in the Cabinet. Epitome of what has passed and of the solution which presents itself to us, is as follows : — I should explain at outset that the fall of, and retirement of, our force from Baku and on Zenjan line, respectively, has had in Tehran and elsewhere very deleterious effect on public opinion. Hostile elements moreover have been given an opportunity by it to revive violent anti-British propaganda. This has resulted in the position of the Cabinet being greatly shaken and a considerable run on the Imperial Bank of Persia. In view of the very favourable trend of operations in Europe, it is difficult to conceive how any intelligent Persian can now dream of entering the war on the enemy’s side but for all that, if we were to suffer any further setbacks in North-West Persia, I am instructed by reliable element here that the pro-German, pro-Turk factions, stimulated by enemies’ propaganda, would turn out the present Cabinet, undoubtedly, replacing it by an extremist Cabinet by whom thecountry would certainly be dragged into the war against us. If the Turks succeeded in ejecting us from Kasyin and occupying Tehran it is certainly considered that they would have no difficulty in compelling Persia to come in on their side. L I informed the Cabinet in strict confidence after previous communication with the General Officer Commanding, Baghdad, what force on this side of Kermanshah we actually had, what reinforcements were now coming and what n * 0re j 2 j^k t k® expected before the winter set in, and added that our troops would do their utmost to^ hold on to Besht, Enzeli, Senneh, Zenjan, and Kasvin specially. ^ We discussed on these premises the disadvantages and advantages of Persia coming in on our side or of remaining neutral but secret- ly benevolent as at present or of becoming more benevolently neutral. They all while asserting their complete readiness to come in if we could put three or even two divisions into the country, unhesitatingly reached the conclusion that if the ability of the General Officer Commanding was really of the accurate extent I had stated, it would be dangerous for Persia to enter the war and she must decide on a neutral policy in some form. But even if it was merely desired to maintain as at present neutrality with moderation and secret benevolence to us, it was held that it would be impossible for the present Cabinet in the present critical circumstances to maintain its position, unless they were enabled to create atmosphere favourable to us by some nublic announcement of friendly concession, which they had been able to secure from us and attract moderate democratic elements. They would by this means be able to pose as a “ popular ” Cabinet. ^ If we agree what they would like to make known would be ( VJ hat , Grea i ■ Brlfc r 1I J&gt; ha . s reiterate(i categorically its determination to respect the independence of Persia. (2) That she has undertaken to press for abrogation of the Anglo-Russian Convention as soon as a Russian Government exists which she can recognise (3) That she has agreed (1) to transfer South Persia Rifles to the° direct control of the Persian Government, and to (2) the despatch to Tehran, as soon as i can be arranged, of a Commission of neutral officers, not Swedes but w era + bly p eandlnav . ia ; us, l to draw U P sc heme for the formation of a uniform tmce for Persia which the present South Persia Rifles would be merged into Meanwhile for the period of the war the South Persia Rifles of Shiraz would be transferred to barman Parma’s control. Latter (in accordance with 1 private understanding between the two Governments) would himself ask and receive permission to retain adequate number of British nersrmn^l +n • • force. It is stipulated in this connection thft Ih XrZuU t suST ly junior (i. e., not sucn as Sykes or even Colonel * u ' uia De sufficient- . v ?= » ss road has been opened up and tranonillitv ? 6 j* S00n as B us Mre-Shiraz the British troops in Bars would be\ithL“aduaiIy. t0 UUderSt00Cl that a gree 0 t U o It: i^of a'^^uiquTZ’ tt^ ™uld maintenance of the present Cabinet with « r ve * mes m order to ensure *• -a: KTiSK'SKS: zssrsH neither ^9 attitude of Turkey is sure to be unfriendly and thus public opinion will be the more inclined towards us with the result that Persian neutrality will become, in the direction advocated by the Government of India, more and more benevolent to us. The above-mentioned two Ministers have not yet discussed with some of their colleagues and the Shah, but their acquiescence is considered certain. It will be realised that in view of actual run on the Imperial Bank of Persia and possibility of further Turkish advance in the near future either on En^eli or Zenjan if present Cabinet is to be maintained there must be no delay in issue of communique above suggested. If I can be informed how far above outlined course of action commands itself to His Majesty’s Govern ment as soon as possible I shall be grateful.

The inhabitants along the South Road are at present too frightened to interfere with merchant caravans which are coming up freely from Kazerun. I am credibly informed that Earman Earma in true Persian fashion has dabbled in a scheme for the creation of some bogus trouble there in order to strengthen his request for rifles should he he refused. There is practically no traffic at present along the North Road and Earman Earma has recently taken over 360 South Persia Rifles Tufangchis who already possess 200 South Persia Rifles rifles with 15,000 rounds of ammunition, the remainder having rifles of their own. When Kawam, at the request of Earman Earma and Consul, pursued Soulat to Eiruzabad in July, I lent him 200 rifles and 20,000 rounds of ammunition. It was subsequently discovered that Kawam had several hundred rifles in reserve from those which were given him in 1916, In addition Kawam and his Arabs have over 250 rifles which were collected from South Persia Rifles deserte.s and mutineers of which only 13 have been restored. The tribesmen and village Tufangchis in Ears are well armed and when fighting against us they produced plenty of ammunition. Before con sidering any further loan of rifles, Consul w r as asked to get back those which were lent to Kawam and also those collected by him. To sell further rifles and ammunition to Earman Earma would mean simply arms traffic as l° ca l P r i ces are ten times the Government sale prices and Earman Earma’s subordinates are unpaid and untrustworthy.

When considering to what extent it is possible to draw on what is regarded as obligatory garrison of Meshed, or to denude Cordon, for purpose of strengthening our small force in Trans-Caspia, the situation in Afghanistan is of course a factor to be borne in mind. I think the only information on the subject I have had from you since leaving Simla was that given in above quoted telegram. Consul-General informs me that all he receives is a brief monthly message from Foreign saying all is quiet. On the other hand, there has been much coming and going lately between Herat and Kushk and there is some reason to believe that the Bolsheviks quite recently offered the Government of Herat to restore Panjdeh and Kushk to Afghanistan. If, as is pretty certain, the Bolsheviks are acting under German instigation they would probably make this a bargain and not a free gift and would stipulate for certain action on the part of Afghanistan. Such stipulation might conceivably be a movement into Khorasan by Afghan troops. This would have the effect of neutralizing or stopping altogether our action in Trans-Caspia, which action is undoubtedly the sole existing obstacle to complete control of the whole of the Central Asian Railway by German Bolsheviks. As Astrakhan is still apparently in Bolshevik hands, the way would then be open for the influx of enemy reinforcements and munitions and the efflux of raw materials. » 2. Thus the question of drawing on troops already in this area, for further strengthening Trans-Caspia, depends largely on the attitude of Afghan istan and I should be grateful for any information available. 158 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 12150, dated the 7th September 1918.)

The Kashgais in their attacks were joined by the inhabitants of Abadeh country and the hostility of the latter since March made supply question diffi cult so that considerable supplies had to be sent at great expense from Shiraz. Small Indian garrisons could not control road in the circumstances of immediate present ; they would be liable to become invested and would have no liberty of action. It is not possible to allot garrison strong enough to have any offensive power together with garrisons of Indian troops at °posts along road connecting Shiraz with Dehbid. Abadeh and Dehbid are not abandoned because for above reasons local Tufangchis have been arranged for * Transposition s groups undecipherable. under South Persia Hifles control. Stores ancillary services have been looted or destroyed in the rising * * * ari( j large losses caused to South Persia Rifles property belonging to British Government. In case of any disturbance in Abadeh-Dehbid district the British will suffer but little inconvenience, Ispahan merchants prefer • uu*j r ° ad is now °P en ’ 80 trade caravans do not require the Abadeh. IJehbid route at present. The inhabitants of the district may suffer losses from raiding tribesmen. Government of Pars will lose income from this rich district and has had revenue money looted. Perhaps Persian Govern ment will suffer through loss of revenue. There is in any case no available camel transport at present to despatch and maintain Indian garrisons of suffi- cient strength at distant outposts like Dehbid and Abadeh. Ehtesham and his Rashgais and Kawam and bis Arabs were keen to pursue and loot Soulat u ^ is , weak a “ (i disheartened following. It was desirable that our new allies should be unanimous against Soulat. Good service was rendered by South Persia Rifles personnel whom I lent Ehtesham with 2 old South Persia Rifles guns and two South Persia Rifles? maxims. These are still with Ehtesham at liruzabad. Neither Farman Parma nor Ehtesham nor Kawam considered it desirable that Indian troops should pursue Soulat into Kashgais territory ar |d in this Consul and I concurred. The relief of the besieged garrison at Abadeh was of vital importance and all available Indian and South Persia Rifles transport was needed for Williams , relief column to that place; also all the available extra transport was needed to bring an ay from Abadeh and Dehbid stores and munitions, bank treasure and regimental and personal effects m order to minimise losses falling on British Government and British troops. In present situation and in purely British interests, I cannot see that the military arrangements made are otherwise than the best possible. Again, as viewed from stand point of British interests, I cannot see that any of the above arrangements are open to objection on political ground. It is open to argument that the arrangements may not suit Persian Govern- ment but I do not conceive it my duty to jeopardise British interests and British troops to suit the convenience of our so-called Persian friends at Tehran. I have arranged South Persia Rifles Tufangchis until such time as the military situation admits of Indian troops or South Persia Rifles troops replacing them, and I have already notified my objection to handing over charge of Abadeh-Dehbid road to Farman Parma. Before Indian troops can be placed there, an expedition will probably be necessary to depprt the ringleaders and punish those who attacked us. The Persian Government must probably recognise the South Persia Rifles and must adopt another attitude before South Persia Rifles troops can re-occupy these posts as garrisons. Since Williams and his relief column and our transport arrived heie to-day the military situation at Shiraz is quite secure, and we only required the replenishment of Artillery ammunition from Saidabad. We are aot waiting for any relief force from Saidabad, very soon two new squadrons supplies, mules* and arrangements forof cavalry will reach Shiraz and a draft of 200 men to bring 16th Rajputs up to strength. About 100 half-wounded and half-sick convalescents will be evacuated to India from Shiraz vid Saidabad. As a safeguard against Persian treachery in Kerman province, one battalion of Indian Infantry and one section Indian Artillery will remain at Saidabad at present. We shall be ready when the hot weather ends, say end of Septemberj to undertake any military measures morally desirable in co-operation with troops from Bushire to make final settlement of our enemies along Kazerun road. At present it does not appear to be profitable to look any further ahead than this. The defeat of Soulat is having far-reaching effects, I regard political situation as good and likely to improve. Kashgai tribes are well content to be rid of Soulat’s oppression. Kawam is on our side and Arab tribes quiet. ^ Kerman province and Bandar Abbas district remain quiet. The general situation in Southern Persia should improve constantly provided we arrest any democrats who attempt to make trouble. The last big local trouble should disappear when the Dashtistan-Kazerun question can be settled by military force. Consul concurs generally but regarding Abadeh-Dehbid he adds:— Begins. Our political interests lie, in my opinion, in maintaining order during absence of our garrisons. We best serve our own ends by serving Persian interests in this matter.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Shiraz, To-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Tehran, 157, Baghdad, Bushire and Ispahan). ^ Enemy occupied Abadeh only short time. It is renorfpd thnt Khan has started tor Tehran. Views of the Governor-General has chano-ed that force for Abadeh should consist of Indian troops, as he is of opinion that sucha force might unduly rouse tribal opposition and now proposes that while he himself should send a force to Abadeh by main road, leaving a^ garrison and a Deputy Governor there, a force of Kashgais under the Illbegi should march towards Sarhad to punish Darashuris. To put in one of his own sons as Deputy Governor is his present idea. In the meantime Sardar Ehtesham remains at Firuzabad to keep an eye on Soulat who has a much larger following in the south than was supposed. The Farsimaidan tribe is said to have followed him possibly _ as result of disturbances in the north. Unless these disturbances are dealt with very soon effect throughout tribal territory would soon be felt. To deal with Soulat in case of necessity Sardar Ehtesham must, therefore, keep a force at Firuzabad. Cost of Illkhanis , Ulbegis* forces is estimated at about tomans 800 a day each for a period of a month or six weeks, possibly two months. Five times this amount is asked by rapacious Kashgai leaders, but Governor-General has cut it down to what he considers lower figure. It will be necessary, besides above, to pay something though nothing like on the same scale, for Governor-General’s own force. Illbegis ask for rifles and ammunition but Staff are unwilling to lend former pending restoration of those taken from South Persia Rifles posts by Illbegis and Arabs (now in possession of Kawam). It is necessary two expeditions should start, without delay, to Abadeh which would be expedient. I am, therefore, advancing about 15,000 tomans for their expenses. It is necessary also that Ulkhanis should be paid something. He will be supine without money and Soulat’s troubles will break out afresh. If troops move in the direction of Firuzabad from Bushire this threat will be much diminished. Sykes with whom I have discussed situation concurs with me. In receiving no news of events in Bushire hinterland I am somewhat hampered, I would be grateful if reply to my telegram, No. 82 of the 12th August, could be sent as soon as possible. Without Government’s further explicit sanction I dislike responsibility of spending these large sums of money which, if the danger of recrudescence of late troubles is to be avoided, must be spent.

Government of India while appreciating value of Haig’s advice think that negotiations with Zafar and Khans and general direction should be left in hands of Force “ D ”, so far as possible, who will make necessary arrange ments through Dr. Young and Ahwaz with Bakhtiaris. If Consul-General, Ispahan, intervenes it will only confuse matters. Haig should be instructed accordingly if you agree.

To-day I warned the Trans-Caspian delegate that my accounts of disorder and indiscipline amongst their forces were so bad that it seems probable that failing drastic remedies, they would lose everything, because of their Jack of trust in Soviet. Large numbers of Russians, who should be fightin^, were doing nothing, that anxious as we were to help them, we had our own interests-to consider and could not afford to participate in a debacle caused by disobedience of Trans-Caspian troops and want of confidence in the Govern ment. According therefore I must insist on drastic steps being taken by his 'Government to enforce discipline and take such measures as would enlist all © lookers on, in the fighting ranks. 2. The accuracy of my remarks was admitted by delegate, who is send ing a telegram to his Government advocating a summary course of action to deal with this indiscipline, and also adopt measures which will reconcile all elements of anti-Bolshevism. 100 (Received with Army Department memoranda m No. 11318, dated the 22nd August 1918.)

We see no difficulty so long as the British officers and non-commissioned officers are limited to those actually belonging to the section of mountain artillery. We feel, however, that proposal is open to following objections if His Majesty’s Government propose to attach additional officers under pretext of being on strength of mountain artillery:—($) that Zafar and other Khans might interpret prolonged presence of British officers^ and non commissioned officers as relieving themselves of full responsibility for protection of oil-fields, &amp;c.; {b) it might prove, particularly with younger Khans, a source of friction, and lead to trouble; (c) it might afford to democrats at Tehran a handle against new and presumably friendly Govern ment and give ground for suspicion that we are introducing into Bakhtiari country South Persia Rifles scheme; (d) in sparing really suitable officers there may be difficulty.* \ These objections would probably fall to the ground if Sardar Zafer after considering proposal in all its bearings cordially puts it forward.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Sketch below of present situation of Prime Minister’s Cabinet will I hope be useful. To deal with they have three main questions— (1) Question of grain. Government has to secure considerable quantities in order to regulate prices in Capital during winter which are still abnormally high. Transport owing to mortality among animals last winter and spring is the main difficulty. As Sultanabad supplies Tehran to a certain extent our own purchases of wheat, there necessitated by arrival of Syrian refugees at Hamadan, also tend to increase their difficulties. (2) Arrears of salary. This question is serious. Government employees whose impoverishment is particularly severe owing to late famine are several months in arrears. These above two questions are matters of money only. Disorders in Pars, occupation of Azerbaijan by Turkish troops, maladministration of last fifteen months, &amp;c., all tend to prevent money reaching Treasury except from tele graphs revenues and Southern customs from which rather less than tomans 250,000 which His Majesty’s Government authorised as an advance will not do much more than cover current expenses. (3) South Persia Hifles. This is real crux. Prime Minister has come into office in radically differing circumstances from those in which he believed he could, in return for our assistance, settle the question. He would, embarrassed as he is by (1) and (2) if, on basis of immediate if temporary recognition of South Persia BJfles, which is in fact what we require of him, he attempted to settle (3) probably be unable to maintain himself until we have restored situation in south to something resembling that of six months agoto insist on fulfilment of his promise would be imprudent. The despatch of reinforcements via Bandar Abbas and the contemplated operations from Busbire should in a few weeks restore our prestige and power in Ears. It should also stabilise position as far north as Ispahan which is very sensitive of events in Ears and also afford the opportunity of weeding out from the South Persia Rifles in Ears the disloyal element. We have to assist Prime Minister in the meantime to deal with (I) and (2). Tomans 100,000 should I think suffice though it falls far below his de- mards. I should be glad of authority to inform him that His Majesty’s Gov ernment will increase for six months the amount payable on account of arrears of moratorium from tomans 50,000 to tomans 150,000, making a total monthly advance of tomans 350,000 instead of tomans 250,000, in return for his friendly co-operation. Meanwhile I am advancing to Government in respect of month of August the balance of last named sum. ° Speaking frankly, I hardly anticipate that in present circumstances and with his cautious character, the Prime Minister will venture on translating his friendliness into official action, but he will assist us, as he is already doing by purchases of supplies, replacing unfriendly officials appointed by last Cabinet by trustworthy men and in services generally of a quiet unofficial character* be will be a great improvement on obstruction manifested by his predecessors 9 and unconcealed hostility. r Addressed to Foreign Office, London; repeated to Baghdad, 4,25, and Cox.,;, f .^,^, .^ggamr^-^s. 7 113 Telegram P.^ No. 732, dated (and received) the 23rd August 1918.

In the circumstances is there any local reason why we should not oh our own responsibility make proclamation associating Governor of Ports and Governor-General, Pars, with it ?

On August 26th, I urged Prime Minister to agree to any other neutrals as Bis Majesty’s Government could not accept Swedish officers. He objected as before to Prench or Americans but said he would take Swiss and urged that we should come to a formal agreement as soon as possible, providing for despatch of a small number to study formation of future single uniform force. Prime Minister then asked what was the number of effectives at Shiraz of South Persia Rifles. His reports were very incomplete from Parman Parma and he could not understand how with nearly 3,000 Indian troops matters could have come to so serious pass that Sykes had had to entrust to Kawam and Sirdar Ehtesham, pursuit of Soulat and to Parman Parma protection of Ispahan road and he felt there must have been between Sykes and Governor-General serious friction; if Governor-General had not had support of our troops, matters could hardly have been worse. My reports, I said, threw very little light on this question which puzzled me very much but they agreed in showing that Governor-General had worked hard to save the situation ; Sykes had been provided, on the other hand, with a very efficient staff. I knew nothing definite as to the effectives of South Persia Rifles except desertions had been very numerous and that a Persian who had recently arrived from Shiraz had said that at most 1,000 remained. His Highness said that Sykes’ mission in this case seemed to have been failure and added that it seemed hardly worth keeping South Persia Rifles. I said that the latter idea was crossing my mind. He then developed idea that we should hand over such part of South Persia Rifles as he could trust to Parman Parma, remainder being disbanded and should make advances to cover cost; force thus retained would be used only on roads and Parman Parma would be free to retain British officers’ services. I remarked that this was very drastic solution but it did not include Kerman where South Persia Rifles were efficient and loyal. His Highness asked why it should not be treated in the same way. Question of South Persia Rifles would be settled and incidentally we should save the immense sums we are now spending, if His Majesty’s Government would agree to this and to arrival of Swiss officers to study. I informed him that I would report what he had said to you, though my having listened to his proposals must not be taken to imply more than personal and possibly indiscreet curiosity. The exchange of notes respecting Swiss officers, I presume, will be the best means of record of agreement, but as to what points are to be included I beg to be informed. This refers to your telegram No. 412. Addressed to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs and repeated to Baghdad. 125 Telegram P., No. 1037-S., dated the 28th August 1918. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, To—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (repeated to Bagh dad and Tehran). Por the political control outside Bushire outposts the following will be the arrangements when our force advances whether it dees so at the Persian Government’s open or tacit request or not. A military situation is created by the advance in either case. It therefore follows that the General Officer Commanding must have political as well as military control, and the Deputy Political Resident as Chief Political Officer will be attached to his staff. Subject to the supreme direction of the General Officer Commanding, other Political Officers, whom the Deputy Political Resident wishes to take with him, will work under his orders on his staff.A reference to the Government of India should be made should any question of permanent policy arise in which the advice of the Deputy Political President is not acceptable to the General Officer Commanding except in such an extreme emergency that there is no time for reference, and, in such a case the Government of India should receive an immediate report of the decision fl taken. This refers to your telegram, No. 1108, dated August 18th, and Cox’s 1100 of same date. 126 No. C.-30, dated Meshed, the 19th July 1918 (Confidential). From Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, To-The Hon’ble Sir Hamilton Grant, K.C.I.E., C.S.I, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence between' Brigadier- General Dale and the Chief of the General Staff a copy of which was sent to me with your endorsement No. 718-W., dated the 4th June 1918. 2. It must first be understood that the observations made by the General m Meshed and its vicinity, and the conversations with Colonel Redl and myself to which he alludes, occurred prior to the arrival of the Kawam-us- Saltanah; and at a time when the province after having endured the rule of Kamran Mirza, a calamity from which a rapid recovery was not possible, had suffered for several months from a continual chano&gt; e of acting Governors-General all of whom were more or less unfit for the post Th? atmosphere has entirely changed since the arrival of the Kawam who ha* consistently maintained his extremely friendly attitude towards ourselves • and, m spite of having suffered from an attack of typhoid fever has dealt with certain pressing questions with energy and decision and thereby done much already to restore order in the province. At the same time, some of the conclusions arrived at by General Dale on the «Political Factors” recmim comment to remove possible misunderstanding. ^ 3. His description of the democrat agitators is fairly accurate The Kawam-us-Saltanah assures me that the democrats of Meshed in suite nf nil the reports that are continually received both by Colonel Redl and myself regarding their pro-Turk and German leanings, are only indirectly interested m the concerns of these Powers; and would not make them their ownTnW and until they are persuaded that the best interests of Persia lie in th • hands. In forming conclusions it is necessary to remember the nninTo^ that exists between the democrat and anti-democrat bodies here and recognise the fact that the latter can best injure the former by report^ to us their strong enemy predilections. The Kawam has remarked tlZ was a very great difference between the democrats of Mieshed and thn Tehran, and this fact seems to be borne out by the recent demonstra fon made m our favour by many of the former in consequence of the exnll^H gtven to them by the Kawam in answer to questions put to idm on Hm subject of our policy and intentions in Persia (vide my Diary No 2f) (v. ! week ending the 18th May, paragraph 12). These which mnv h?'/ the , here for facility of reference, were communicated to me by a reliable friend ^ Are you.aware that the British are buyin 0, the Grain harvest in advance, and that the reshtof ' w m continuance of famine conditions in the province ? I have heard of this, and will give it my attention. No doubt tho matter will be amicably settled with the British. * th Q—Row long do the Government intend to submit to the presence of British troons m our country ? Do they not see th,I f of expelling them f J nty not see the necessityThe Ministers at^ Tehran understand this question better than you, and being Persians dislike as much as anyone the interference of foreigners in their country : but they know that the object of , the British in bringing troops to our country is not that they may take possession of it but that they may protect themselves against their enemies. Formal promises to this effect had been given to the Government by the British, and your minds mav be at rest. Of course the conduct of the troops in our country will be carefully watched, and anything incorrect at once brought to notice. Q‘ Are you aware that we had determined to stir up the whole province against the coming of British troops, and only laid aside the intention in view of the fact that an active' and energetic Governor-General is coming to Khorasan who will help us in this matter ? A. Such a plan as this is highly objectionable for many reasons. We have no troops which could oppose the British ; we cannot even keep our own people in order. You must remember that the times are most serious; we are threatened with trouble from the Turcomans and Armenians for instance, and the presence of British troops will be useful in helping us to remain at peace and be protected from such dangers. 4. General Dale’s criticism of the “resentful Civil Government” is a little strong. I do not think the Local Government here can ever have been justly described as resentful towards us, at least since I have been in Meshed, and I am quite convinced that it has never had the remotest intention of using its force against the British. The mass of the Meshed public, in which the private soldiers of the garrison, may also be included, is if anything pro-British, and our recent famine relief work has done much to raise 'us in the estimation of all classes. 5. General Dale must have bad the de Beauvais intrigue in mind when writing of the Caucasians. But these people also have never been antagonistic to us even, strange as it may appear, while we were engaged in frustrating their schemes on behalf of de Beauvais; and there is nothing to fear from them. They may possibly be sufficiently favourably inclined towards the Turks to give Turkish refugees food and shelter, but it is noteworthy that since their leaders definitely promised me that nothing of the kind should occur in the future, neither Colonel Bedl nor I have had a reliable report incriminating them. 6. In regard to the questions of the use of force in Meshed and its possible necessity this correspondence might give the impression that .the General had contemplated such action without reference to me. This I feel sure is not the case : the request for the use of force would naturally come from this Consulate-General in almost every set of circumstances that can be imagined, and moreover the relations existing between General Dale and myself are of the most cordial. 7. A copy of this letter will be submitted to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran, for informa lion, with a copy of the correspondence to which it relates. 127 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 11494, dated the 26th August 1918.)

I spoke on the subject of the proposed proclamation to the Prime- Minister yesterday, explaining the objects to him. He said that he would like it to appear that the Persian Government alone were conducting the operations and that colour to this absurd fiction should be given by allowing Darya Begi to send a small force with it; but on my pointing out that the object of the proclamation would be lost if no mention of British troops was made, he agreed and suggested that co-operation of British should be less prominently mentioned. While not demurring to signature by Darya Begi he observed that Parman Parma was technically the proper person to sign it, adding that he doubted whether proclamation would have much effect. He made no comment when I told him secretly of the measures it was proposed to take except those regarding the rebel Khans, This refers to Bushire telegram No. 1108 to Government of India.

To these views and suggestions I venture to demur. That the contemplated advance necessarily creates a military situation, I do not agree. As I under stand them its objects are—(1) to secure situation at Shiraz, which has been declared not military but political and not primarily to destroy an enemy force; (2) to bring about disappearance of Wassmuss and of hostile Chiefs; (3) to open the road to Bushire. It is intended presumably that these aims be achieved with as little bloodshed as possible. Extent of opposition anticipated I do not know, but in view of imposing ’preparations we are making and after Soulat’s failure that the force may reach Shiraz without encountering any serious resistance seems not improbable. The knowledge of the Hinterland and Ears possessed by General Douglas should also materially contribute to this result. In this case the situation appears to me to remain predominately political although there is a military factor. In particular it seems to me neither necessary nor advantageous in any circumstances to grant the decision (dis cretion ?) to discuss questions of permanent policy to General Officer Com- manding.^ Until the Column reaches Shiraz and has ipso facto achieved its main objects, such questions can scarcely arise. Even now the political character of the situation is admitted, but it will then be confirmed and strengthened and in my view there could be no advantage in removing from decision of His Majesty’s Government questions of permanent policy and entrusting their solution to General Officer Commanding (or even Chief Political Officer) who cannot in nature of things possess the requisite knowledge of all facts to (deal) with them.

I have the honour to forward herewith a report on the recent events in Shiraz up to the present date. This report is an ad interim one only, as events are still in progress, the results of which cannot yet be gauged,* but it is probable that so far as actual hostilities are concerned, the “ siege M or “ investment ” of Shiraz, may be said to be at an end. 2. The causes of this regrettable outbreak are varied, but the chief of them are as follows :— (a) Pro-German intrigues from Tehran, and agitation excited by Wassmuss, who has managed to maintain his influence over the Pashti and Dashtistan chiefs. (5) A genuine desire on the part of large numbers of Persians to see their country free from all foreign interference. However much the Persian patriot may be derided, still it is a fact that • patriotism does exist in Persia, and that such feelings animate t / som e of our enemies is proved by the attached letter, written by the Darashuri Chief, who has been prominent in the recent fighting. (&lt;?) A dread on the part of the Kashgais that their predatory habits 1 would sooner or later be put a stop to. They have seen sina11 bribes punished one after the other, and it is probable that they considered that if they combined, they might force the ; British out of the country. (d) A dislike of the South Persia Bifles, fostered by the Persian Government in power during last winter, which refused to recognize the force as in any way Persian, and also a contempt for the South Persia Bifles, the result of many encounters with the Swedish Gendarmerie. case » whatever the remote causes, the immediate cause is evident, the outbreak at Khaneh Zinian was not premeditated, as the presence ot women, children and flocks conclusively proves. Whether women and children were unfortunately killed in the course of Lieutenant-Colonel Williams attack on the Darashuris on the 12th Mav or not, the rumour spread that they had been killed, and that their corpses were taken to Soulat s camp It is said that the Soulat’s wife took an oath that unless her husband took up arms to avenge the death of these women and children, she would divorce him. Such a story loses nothing in the telling and would undoubtedly have had a very great effect on the tribes S ’ “ l ~ ^ “■&gt; °&lt;!»! For ‘ un £ tel J&gt; he was unable to conquer the deep distrust of Mahommed Ali Ehan, Kashqul. who has for long successfully^ opposed the Soukt andis especially the bitter enemy of the Kazerunis. ’ “ 8 consit^w^^ vatoabto s!rr“fo;uf ed t0 US&gt; ^ ^ S-ed^S friendliness tosrard^th^Kawam^'s'a^^et o'ff^o^what a&lt; ^ Tooa ^ e ^ 1 * P°Kcy of inevitable unfriendlinesT of the Soulat-ed Dotoeh TT* 40 me the 11 » :L“ZThe Arab tribes, many of whom bad been punished for robberies, were all ready to join the Soulat should the latter have inflicted any severe reverse on us, and several of them actually sent contingents to fight against us. Had the Kawam openly joined the enemy, our case would have been very different. His tribes would have joined in, and, the Kawam’s influence used against us, we would have had a hostile city at our back. As it was, the Arabs as a whole kept out of the struggle, and except for the troublous few days preceding the occupation of the town by our troops, which were the expected result of our retirement within the perimeter of cantonments, the town remained quiet and practically no enemy entered the city. Finally, it was the Kawam who personally conducted the negotiations so successfully concluded by Ali Khan’s abandonment of his brother’s cause, and the practical break-down of enemy opposition in the field. 6. As I reported to the Government of India early in the course of these events, I hoped with the Farman Farma’s assistance to cause dissessions in the enemy’s ranks, and this was finally accomplished. It was fortunate that in Sirdar Ehtesham, a former Illkhani, we had a suitable person to replace the Soulat when the latter should be defeated and turned out,—but Sirdar Ehtesham is not an ideal Illkhani, being weak in character and almost as avaricious as the Soulat. 7. General Sykes has blamed both the Governor-General and myself that 'we did not bring about the rapproachement with Ali Khan long before it actually happened, and claims that if his advice had been followed, the state o^ investment would have been brought to an end much sooner. He remarks in his Confidential Memorandum No. 179—143-G. of 3rd July, to myself, “ We have been aware of the efforts of the Farman Farma, the Kawam and yourself to separate the Kashgais from the Soulat. The main factors to bring this about were Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashquli, and Sirdar Ehtesham, and this policy has unceasingly been urged on you by the Inspector- General, South Persia Kifles, since the beginning of hostilities. We are therefore obviously aware of the policy which we have advocated ourselves unceasingly from the beginning, and regarding which our complaint is that these steps were not taken earlier than they were ”, General Sykes ^ is much mistaken in thinking that the main factors were Mahommed Ali Khan and Sirdar Ehtesham. The principal and deciding factor was the proper appreciation of the situation and the knowledge of when and how to use the opportunities open to us, and both the Governor- General and myself were assured, and General Sykes was repeatedly assured by me, that the services of Sirdar Ehtesham and Mahommed Ali Khan would be made use of at the proper moment, and that their premature use would not merely be valueless but actually harmful. At least, I can claim that when the negotiations were opened, they were at once successful in bringing about a cessation of hostilities and relieving us from the very ignominious position to which we had come of being closely invested by an irregular force of tribesmen at least no more numerous than our own troops, who had invariably beaten the enemy in the field. 8. It is true that one of the chief causes of our inability to move out f freely was the presence at our backs of the South Persia Kifles, whose loyalty was so little to be counted on that not only could they not be taken out, except in very small numbers, to fight, but their presence paralysed our own striking force. Whether the policy of retaining such an enemy in our pay for the sake of the effect on Kerman-Abadeh and elsewhere was sound, is not for me to argue. Their disloyalty was thoroughly well known to the General Staff, and was quoted in several reports by General Sykes ; but when I was informed, on the 27th June, that the position as regards supplies was so serious that it would probably be necessary to send away the mounted branches of our forces, including the Burma Mounted Kifles and the 15th Lancers, as well as the South Persia Bifles Cavalry, while retaining here alarge number of South Persia Rifles Infantry, I ventured to expostulate with General Sykes and the Staff that it appeared to me criminal to keep a large number of disloyal and dangerous armed men, who were and would continue to be a great menace to the remainder of our force, paying and feeding them at a time when both money and food were so scarce that our own troops were not receiving their full pay and were drawing reduced rations. The only reply to my expostulations was, that a charge was brought against me of not having made sufficient use of my political powers in bringing in supplies for the force ! 9. I much regret that the state of tension between General Sykes and his staff, and myself, has been the cause of much dislocation of work, though I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to prevent this most Tunfortunate state of affairs from having serious results, * # ■ Copy forwarded, for information, to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. 'Report on the recent trouble with Soulat-ed-Douleh and the Kashgais. May 9^,-^-Early in May, the Darashuri tribe (Kashgais) were encampt on the plain round Khaneh Zinian,—about 29 miles west of Shiraz,—on then northward migration. Some two or three donkeys belonging to the South Persia Rifles post at that place were stolen or strayed into the tribesmen’s camps, and a party of South Persia Rifles discovered them and took them back to the post, at the same time seizing some of the tribesmen whom they accused of robbing the animals. It is also said, that the donkeys were brought in by a headman of the tribe, who was made a prisoner, but as I have not been favoured with a report on the subject by the General Staff, I cannot vouch for this. Ayaz Kikha Khan, the Chief of the tribe, sent in a demand to tbe Officer Commanding the post, Captain Will, South Persia Rifles, demanding the release of the men, which demand being refused, he opened fire on the post. May 12th. —On news being received at Shiraz, a force of South Persia Rifles under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams went out to Khaneh Zinian and attacked the Darashuris on the 3 2th May. The latter are said to have lost some 15 persons, killed and wounded, and several prisoners were taken. Our own loss was one man only. Among the killed and wounded of the enemy are said to have been several women and children \ and much booty in the shape of sheep and goats was secured. The Soulat-ed-Douleh at the time was at Piruzabad. No Political Officer accompanied this column, nor was any political assistance invited, though it is almost certain that such a trivial incident could have been settled without recourse to punitive measures. It was, however, apparently considered a favourable moment for puttin 0 * gr check on the ambitions of the Soulat, and that the punishment of the tribe would prove an easy affair. Reinforcements of Indian troops were sent out on the 13th from Shiraz, but no further fighting took place, and the whole column returned to Shiraz. i The l ^ ) . aras ^ ur 1 is ^ the meantime had sent a deputation to wait on the fcoulat at Tiruzabad, and are said to have thrown the bodies of the women and children killed on the ground in front of his tent. The Soulat was forced iv pubhc opinion to take up the affair, with the result that he sent a telegram to the Persian Government reminding them that they themselves did not recognize the South Persia Rifles, who had wantonly attacked the parashuns. He also wrote to the Mullas asking for advice.May 18th .—On the 18th May, I had myself started on my journey towards Bunder Abbas, hut returned to Shiraz the same day, owing to the break-down of my motor car. Before departing, I wrote a letter of advice to the Soulat (copy attached), to which General Sykes later took great exception, saying that it had been written to our enemy, the Soulat, without his knowledge. I pointed out to him that his own letter to the Soulat (to which I referred in my letter) had been sent without my knowledge ; moreover I had spoken to General Sykes of the general purport of my letter before its despatch. This letter of General Sykes’, in my opinion, was one of the contributory causes which induced the Soulat to decide in favour of hostilities. May kOth .—On the 20th May, I warned the Staff that the situation would probably develope into fighting, and that the outposts at Bajgah, Kainabad and Bagh-i-Jannat might be attacked, and that in the event of hostilities, some trouble in the town should he anticipated, but that I did not consider it likely. I had requested General Sykes to avoid, provocative action against the tribes, and he agreed, though it was of course understood that attack by the enemy would be met by counter measures. Strong orders from the Cabinet at this time would almost certainly have dissuaded Soulat-ed-Douleh from active hostilities, but Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the head of the Cabinet, would not he per suaded to act firmly. May 21st .—On the 9 lst May, news was received that a small outpost on the Sineh Safid range, overlooking the pass leading to Dasht-i-Arjan plain, some six miles beyond Khaneh Zinian, had been attacked and invested, and acting on instructions, the garrison of 20 South Persia Bifles, after inflicting losses on the enemy, in an attack on a sangar (when individual gallantry was shown by a junior Persian officer) retired on Khaneh Zinian, eleven men arriving there with their rifles. I was informed by the Staff that but for treachery, the fort could hold out for two months, having plenty of food, ammunition and an ample supply of water, and I reported to this effect, but, from a message received later, it appeared that the well in the post did not hold water, and that in all probability, the enemy would cut the water-channel running near the post. As there is perennial water running about 60 yards from the fort, no great fears were entertained for the safety of the post. At this time, the Kashgais appeared to have definitely decided on hostilities, and some 2,000 closely invested Khaneh Zinian, while others were collected between there and Deh Sheikh (a small post between Chinar Bahdar and Khaneh Zinian, and situated near the head of the Siakh valley), and in the Siakh valley. The Mullas among the Kashgais were preaching Jehad, and their case was immensely strengthened by the fact that the South Persia Rifles had been definitely disowmed as a Persian force by the Persian Government, w T ho plainly stated that the force should be regarded as a “ foreign ” force. The Governor-General was taking energetic action and bringing pressure to bear on the Soulat and on the Mullas, but the matter had proceeded too far for such measures to he of any great use. His Highness frankly told me he thought hostilities were imminent and gave his opinion that, failing decided military success, on a large scale, all roads would he cut off, no supplies would come in, and there would be grave danger of the Arabs in general, and possibly of the Kawam himself, joining the combination against us, in W'hich case the situation would be extremely serious. The General Staff were duly informed of these possibilities, and it was agreed that His Highness and I should take such measures as were possible to avert the greatest danger,—that of the Kawam-ul-Mulk joining the enemy,—and that we should also use our utmost endeavours to keep Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashquli, detached from the Soulat, who was, known to he making efforts to attract him. His Highness also put pressure (as best understood, i. e., by presents of money) on the Mullas in Shiraz, to make them declare against Jehad, and in this he was extraordinarily successful. The results of His Highness’ constant policy of leniency towards the Democratic leaders now became apparent. They failedto combine against us, and acted in a very feeble manner at a time when Soulat-ed-Douleh thought that they would succeed in raising the town against us. The Sirdar Ehtesham, elder half-brother of the Soulat, and who has once been Illkhani himself, was at this time in Shiraz, and with the concurrence of the Staff, I conveyed a message to him that his continued presence in Shiraz would be desirable, and I sent him a sum of money through the Governor- General for his maintenance and expenses, and I received an assurance from him that he would remain in the town. On the 22nd, a telegram was received from the Cabinet to the Governor- General for delivery to the Soulat, ordering him to keep the peace. May 23rd.—r-Qn the 23rd May, I wrote to the Karguzar worning him that the Kashgais were making military preparations, and likewise warning him that His Majesty’s Government would not be in any way responsible for any hostilities brought on by the actions of the Kashgais. On this day, the Kazerunis arrived at Khaneh Zinian, and some of them proceeded to join the Soulat in the Siakh valley and on the same day the Governor-General received a letter from the Soulat declaring that he had decided on fighting. In the meantime, I had engaged, through the Kawam, a body of about 700 riflemen for the defence of the town and its approaches. May 24th .—On the 24th May, a force of Indian troops under Colonel Orton moved out to attack the Kashgais, and if possible to relieve the Khaneh Zinian garrison. Fighting took place the next day, and the Kashgais were driven off with losses which were estimated by the Staff at 350 killed and wounded (though, as the enemy almost invariably got away with their dead and wounded, such estimates are bound to be largely apocryphal). Our own casualties were moderately heavy, including two British officers killed. It was considered necessary to send out reinforcements from Shiraz for the retirement of the Column, which fact had a bad effect on popular imag ination. Before the action took place the South Persia Rifles garrison at Khaneh Zinian had treacherously murdered Captain Will and Sergeant Coomber and had surrendered the post with their rifles, ammunition and food to the Kazerunis who were investing them. A large portion of the garrison, including three Persian officers, marched in unarmed to Shiraz, where they were arrested and enquiries were commenced. On the retirement of the troops, the post of Deh Sheikh was evacuated, and our outpost line was thus withdrawn to Chinar Bahdar, a distance of about seven miles from Shiraz. The Kashgais followed up the retirino* Column, and surrounded Chinar Rahdar. May 26th .—General Sykes, on the 26th, again urged the despatch of reinforcements, and if possible, the immediate use of aeroplanes. In view of the act of treachery of the South Persia Rifles at Khaneh Zinian, and of the very uncertain attitude of the remainder of the South Peisia Rifles in Shiraz, the guns, machine guns and spare ammunition of that force were placed under the direct charge of British officers and non commissioned officers, or with the Indian troops. They still retained a certain amount of their ammunition, and they thus constituted a very serious danger. Prom enquiries it appeared that one of the principal offenders at Khaneh Zinian was a Persian officer, a half-brother of Sarhang (Lieutenant- Colonel) Fath-ul-Mulk, and of the Karguzar, Medhat-es-Sultaneh. Fath-ul- Mulk had been a Yavar (Major) in the old Gendarmerie, and principally instrumental in changing the situation when the Swedes and Germans were afl-powerfu m Shiraz in 1915-16, and he had then arrested all the enemy officers and men. Por these and other services, he had been amply recompensed After the formation of the South Persia Rifles, it was considered that he was not working loyally for the corps, and he was given a civil appointment, as Deputy Governor of Niriz,—still however drawing his pay as senior Persian officer in the South Persia Rifles. gswuifiiTi'ifw. 1 .. •_When Captain Will and the non-commissioned officer were murdered, Fath-ul-Mulk’s half-brother, Murtaza Quli Khan, called for cheers for Fath- ul-Mulk, the “Head of the new South Persia Rifles” with which he proposed to replace the present corps. Many officers and men were supposed to be implicated in this plot, and it is certain that large numbers of men deserted when the details of the Khaneh Zinian affair began to leak out. Fath-ul-Mulk himself was placed under close arrest under an Indian guard, and I telegraphed to Tehran requesting that Medhat-es-Sultaneh might be recalled and another Karguzar might be sent in his place. The post at Chinar Rahdar having been fired into by night, the South Persia Rifles garrison requested that they might be withdrawn, and this was accordingly done. Our furthest outpost was now Bagh-i-Jannat, about five miles west of Shiraz. The Commandant, Fars Brigade, South Persia Rifles, represented to the Staff that he was so doubtful of the loyalty of the remaining South Persia Rifles that he recommended that they should not be used in any military operation. British non-commissioned officers were withdrawn from all outposts except JSTiriz, of which the fate was unknown, as the telephone line had been inter rupted. May 25th .—On May 25th, I telegraphed to Government that the Governor-General, the Kawam and I considered either that we must make peace with the Kashgais, which could be done by large money payments, or else that a large force of India|troops, up to possibly 10,000 should be /k quartered at Shiraz. I stated my opinion that we could hold out here until relief arrived, but that relief should be sent as soon as possible, as roads would speedily be cut, and we would be starved out in two months. In response to an urgent telegram from the Chief of the General Staff, the Staff reported on May 29th that they were in possession of sufficient supplies for two months, and would be able to seize enough from the threshing floors for another month. They further stated their opinion that two squadrons, two battalions and one mountain battery would be the maximum force that could be moved up from Bunder Abbas, and in addition they considered 6,000 or 7,000 reinforcements would be required for Bushire, whose objective should be Kazerun. They reported that liberty of action of the Indian troops was greatly restricted by the presence of the South Persia Rifles, and Kawam’s Arabs engaged by me, who might join against us at the slightest reverse, but that when the effect of the landings at Bushire and Bunder Abbas began to be felt, that liberty of action would be restored. In the meantime, Soulat would be attacked whenever a favourable opportunity occurred. The remnant of the South Persia Rifles, both here and at Abadeh, who took an oath to remain faithful to the end of the war were to receive a bonus of two months’ pay. I may mention that when the matter was under discussion, both Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, Commandant, Fars Brigade, and I, were given to understand that this bonus was to be offered to Persian officers only, and to this we both agreed, but the extension of the bonus to the rank and file was decided on by the Staff without my knowledge. May 29th .—The views of General Sykes and myself were requested by the Secretary of the War Office regarding the nature of the support required, and also regarding our future position, and the status of the South Persia Rifles. General Sykes replied in his telegram No, 179—49-G. of May 29th that he had already furnished his views regarding the military support required and the future position. His views regarding the future status of the South Persia Rifles are not concerned in the present report, and are therefore omitted. My own views were given to General Sykes as follows: “ South Persia Prifles are of no military value as an independent f force, and area great danger, and even if recognized by the Persian Gov- j ernment will require two years’ training with Indian troops before efficiency J can be expected as a disciplined force. In the meantime, I consider we should maintain sufficient Indian troops to safeguard our position in the'SB ”«P&gt;w'nn * 10 face of possibly entire hostile population of Far.” My own views as to the future status of the South Persia Rifles also form the body of a separate report and are therefore not quoted here. May 30th .—On May 30th, the Kawam-ul-Mulk received orders to support the Governor-General, and orders were again sent to the Soulat to prevent further fighting. The latter, however, professed to believe that the telegram was the work of the Governor-General, and not of the Government, who, he said, were sending him orders in an opposite sense. May 31st .—On May 31st, Lieutenant-Colonel Williams reported to the Staff that the position in the South Persia Rifles was slightly better, and that the plot was mainly confined to the members of the late Swedish Gendarmerie. General Sykes reported to Tehran accordingly, and remarked that the Kerman Brigade up to date had caused little anxiety. A report was received that Wassmuss with three or four other Germans had left Kazerunto join Soulat, but there is no certain evidence of his presence in the latter’s camp. The attitude of the Kawam-ul-Mulk had much improved since he heard that reinforcements would be despatched, and in consequence the force of his men guarding the town became much more dependable, though the Staff persisted,—for no doubt very valid and prudent reasons,—to regard them as a source of almost equal danger with the South Persia Rifles* In my opinion, which I communicated to the Staff, the Kawam might now be relied on to continue friendly to ourselves except perhaps in the face of serious disaster, in which case I thought it probable he might turn against us. Jime 3rd.—On June 3rd, I reported to Government that the Soulat had written to the Governor-General and had telegraphed to the Persian Govern ment to the effect that the Kashgais had not been the aggressors and that even after we had struck at the Larashuris (on the 11th May) at Kbaneh Zinian, he had restrained the tribesmen until they had again been attacked by ourselves on the 25th May. He said that if His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran could even now give^ him a satisfactory assurance that Kash°-ai interests and territory were not interfered with, he on his side would guarantee to keep his tribes in order and maintain order on the main roads which pass through his territory. At the same time, if we rejected his offer, he and the whole of the Kashgais were ready to fight it out to the end. After consult ation with the Governor-General, the Kawam and General Sykes and his staff I telegraphed my opinion that three courses only remained open to us— * {a) If a forward movement could be made from Bushire within a very short period against objectives close to that place, and if it were followed by an early movement towards Shiraz, the effect would be to draw off the Dashti and Dashtistan men from the Soulat and have a paralysing effect on the Soulat himself, and for these ten days or so the Governor-General could keep the Soulat im movable. (5) To remain on the defensive at Shiraz and await the arrival of re inforcements. The objections to this course w r ere that in a short time the roads would be cut, no supplies could come in, it would have a very bad effect on the townspeople and on the Arabs and we should lose our prestige. lo accept feoulat s terms and make peace with a view to a later re settlement with Soulat (this last view was naturally the view of rccommendr 0611 ^ 1, ^ 0116 WhiCh 1 C ° Uld ^ conscientiousl y While submitting these alternatives, I remarked that it appeared that we were hardly strong enough to attempt any action outside the valley, and naturally this remark was based on information accorded to me by the Staff. I likewise reported my belief m the reliability of the Kawam and his men in the town, but not of his tribes generally. General Sykes on the same day report! ed that neither the town nor the South Persia Riffes in Shiraz could he depended on were the Indian troops invested or defeated. ld bThe whole position at this time was certainly one fraught with dangers and difficulties. His Majesty’s Minister at this period asked me whether it would he possible to buy off the Soulat, and whether such a bargain would involve the disbandment of. the South Persia Kifles and the removal of Indian troops, and to this I replied'that in my opinion such a bargain could be made, more es pecially if the South Persia Rifles were largely reduced in numbers, and were organised in such a manner as to secure popular approval, but that disband ment of the South Persia Rifles and the removal of the Indian troops would not he necessary. I remarked that to buy the Soulat would he expensive and I did not recommend the course suggested, as in my opinion the Soulat was not to be trusted to keep any bargain that we might make with him. To this His Majesty’s Minister replied to the following effect: “ I am entirely of your opinion that the Soulat is not to he trusted, and must sooner or later he firmly dealt with. The only advantage to be gained by negotiations with him would be that time would be gained, and if he is in the frame of mind that Shiraz reports appear to indicate, it is not probable that he will w r ait while his terms (which involve whole future of Soper) are being examined by His Majesty’s Government. I hope I may yet elicit some form of tempo rary recognition of the South Persia Rifles from Yossuq-ed-Douleh, which might ease the situation, and I am making great efforts to get him into office.” I gave a copy of this telegram to the General Staff, and read out to Colonel Orton, Deputy Inspector-General, such portions of my own telegram to the Minister—above referred to—as were necessary. This most unfortunately i led the Staff to believe that negotiations were being carried on without their previous knowledge, and they reported to the Government of India to this effect in their telegrams Nos. 179—76 and 77-G. of the 7th June. June 6th .—On June 5th, General Sykes reported in reply to Chief of General Staff’s telegram No. 43554 of the 4th, that disbandment of Pars Brigade, South Persia Rifles, would be inadvisable, on account of the bad effects on Abadeh and other places in Pars, and on the Kerman Brigade. That Pars generally was hostile, and without help from outside the Indian garrison at Shiraz would be invested. That in the near future the bulk of the Arab tribes were likely to join against us, and the Pars Brigade, South Persia Rifles, would probably desert or revolt. About this time, intercepted letters proved that Soulat was endeavouring to get the Mamassenis to join him, and the necessary measures were taken in Tehran to bring pressure on the Mamasseni headmen to keep neutral. These measures proved successful. I wns informed that it was the intention of the Staff to evacuate the out post of Bagh-i-Jannat. I urged on General Sykes and his Staff the extreme importance of holding this outpost as long as possible in order to prevent the close investment of the town, but after an examination of the post by the Staff, who decided that the place was a “ death-trap ”, it was evacuated. The Bagh- i-Nawab had been evacuated some days previously. On the 7th, on my urgent representation of the political effect, the Khushk-i-Kawami (also called Afif- abad) was occupied by a party of Indian troops. On the same day, I arranged to bring in the Civilians to Cantonments and next day brought the bulk of the treasure from the Bank into Cantonments, and placed it under an Indian guard. . Th® Kawam-ul-Mulk was again somewhat wavering, as with the closer investment of the forces, the situation in the town grew somewhat bad. Placards appeared calling on the people to join the “ national ” army of the Soulat. June 6th .—I telegraphed to Tehran asking that Soulat if possible should he dismissed by the Persian Government from the Illkhaniship, and Sirdar Ehtesham appointed in his place. Sirdar Ehtesham had asked for an assurance signed by General Sykes and myself that we would assist him in getting the Tllkhaniship himself, and I in formed the Government of India and the Minister that m my opinion such an♦ 12 assurance should, if given, be signed by myself alone. There was unfortunately no Cabinet in existence at this time and the Minister telegraphed that he would urge this step on any new Cabinet that might be formed. As my actions in this respect have been severely criticised by General Sykes, I will here relate the whole circumstances. As previously stated, I had conveyed a message on the 22nd May to the Sirdar Ehtesham that his presence in town would be desirable, and had received a reply that he would not leave town without my knowledge. In 1917 I had paid him a sum of 200 tomans a month as a sort of retain ing fee, up to the time of our agreement with Soulat in the end of May 1917, but, after that I had ceased to pay him as I considered that such payment was not compatible with the terms of that agreement. About the beginning of June 1918, the Farman Parma had proposed to me that it would be sound to recommence the payment of a monthly sum, and that I should also pay the arrears since the cessation of the payment last year. This I did, paying the amount to the Farman Farma himself, who told me that, not being quite, con vinced of Sirdar Ehtesham’s good intentions, he had only paid him half the amount and was keeping the remainder to pay him on a suitable occasion. I sent my Consulate Mirza to Sirdar Ehtesham with a verbal assurance that I had telegraped to Tehran recommending his appointment as Illkhani. It appears that he was not satisfied with this verbal assurance, and even told General Sykes that he had received no such assurance, though the fact of the payment of money to him was in reality the best of all assurances, and more over the Farman Farma and the Kawam both informed me that he had knowledge of my intentions regarding him. On the 21st June, I issued a proclamation to the Kashgais assuring them that we had no particular enmity against them, but against their Chief, the Soulat. On the 19th, Ali Khan, Salar-i-Hashmat, another brother of the Soulat and of the Sirdar, had approached Shiraz after capturing the outpost of Bajgah. M ith the Governor-General’s and my concurrence, and with the knowledge of of the General Staff, Sirdar Ehtesham opened negotiations with Ali Khan to detach him from the Soulat. At General Sykes’ request, on the 22nd June I gave Sirdar Ehtesham a written assurance that we would have no dealings with the Soulat, and I promised him a sum of 250 tomans a month for bis maintenance while in Shiraz, and that when the settlement of the lllkbani appointment took place, his own interests would be considered; while, to enable him to deal more effectively with Ali Khan, I promised to pay the latter a sum of 200 tomans a month if he would leave the Souiat. The letter was delivered by the Farman Farma to the Sirdar Ehtesham in the presence of the Kawam, JMahommed Wali Mirza and my Consulate Mirza, but General Sykes later told me that Sirdar Ehtesham had informed him that the letter was merely shewn to him, and taken back by the Farman Farma, and that in it he saw no reference to any assurance about himself. All the persons present at the interview assure me the letter was taken by Sirdar Ehtesham and placed in his pocket. Even with this assurance, the negotiations were still a failure, and later on I was asked to give another assurance, leaving out Ali Khan s name, which I did, repeating to Sirdar Ehtesham the assurance formerly given. My Consulate Mirza was accused by the General of harbour ing enmity to Sirdar Ehtesham, and of having omitted the personal assurances in my leiter of the 22nd June. Luckily, when substituting my letter of bOth June tor that of 22nd June, I had still retained the original drafts,—in English and Persian—-of the latter, and was able to correct the misapprenension o t le Geneial on the subject. It is better, though out of chronological sequence, to complete the story of the negotiations leading up to the present ation ot the sanad of Illkhaniship on the Sirdar Ehtesham. The negotia tions between Sirdar Ehtesham and Ali Khan having broken down, at e request or the Governor-General, the Kawam made certain movements. ELe put himself in communication with Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashquli, an ie lattei approached Ali Khan with a view to getting him to come in and discuss terms with the Kawam. Mahommed Ali Khan alsowrote letters to the Darashuri Chiefs, which induced them to abandon the Sonlat. On the 1st July, informed the Staff that a meeting between Ali Khan and Mahommed Ali Khan on one side, and the Kawam and 'Sirdar Ehtesham on the other, was imminent, and I informed them that the Farman Farma and the Kawam intended to propose that Ali Khan should be made Illbegi, in order to separate him from the Soulat. On the 2nd, the meeting took place, and agreements were drawn up, by which Sirdar Ehtesham was recognised as Illkhani and Ali Khan as Illbegi, as reported in my telegram No. 125 to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on * of which a copy is enclosed. the 3rd July. These agreements* were shewn to General Sykes and his Staff, immediately they had been translated, and the General expressed his entire approval of them, and warmly congratulated the Governor-General and the Kawam on the success of their endeavours to find a way out of our diffi culties. The Governor-General was anxious to avoid giving any sanad to the new Illkhani before orders were received from Tehran, but General Sykes impressed on me the necessity from a military and political point of view of the announcement by the Governor-General, in order to allay any doubts or suspicions in the minds of Sirdar Ehtesham and of the Kashgais generally I therefore used my influence with His Highness, with the result that the $anad was presented in our presence on the 4th July. General Sykes had on several occasions taken exception to His Highness* unwillingness to openly and definitely announce that the Illkhaniship would be given to Sirdar Ehtesham, but I am satisfied that His Highness had good cause for delaying the announcement. In the first place, Sirdar Ehtesham is not a man of strong character, and it was not expedient to announce his appointment when the Kashgais were almost solid in their attachment to the Soulat. He had shown his weakness by his failure in negotiating with Ali Khan, even supported by my assurance and the promise of a monthly payment. In the second place, His Highness is not in reality empowered to -dismiss and appoint Illkhanis,--this power is vested in the Central Gov ernment, and it is possible even now that his action will be disavowed by the Persian Government. (Some difficulty is at the present moment being experienced in Tehran on this very point.—H. G.— 23-7-18.) General Sykes, however, would make no allowances for the Governor- General’s hesitancy, and agreeing as I did that if the announcement were not definitely made the effect would be bad, I pressed the point upon His Highness and secured his consent. It is, however, unfair in my opinion to blame His Highness for not having taken action before, considering that he is himself liable to dismissal at any moment by the Persian Govern ment. June 7th .—On the 7th June, a telegram was received in Shiraz for Soulat from the e#-Prime Minister, giving him certain encouragement. The Soulat brought great pressure to bear on the Kawam to declare himself on the side of the national force, while the Governor-General and I were doing our utmost to persuade him to definite action against the Soulat, and on the 9th, the Farman Farma persuaded him to take up his residence in the Arq, which undoubtedly produced a great moral effect. The Kawam also publicly announced his intention of defending the town against an attack from outside by the forces of the Soulat. June 10th .—At this time the enemy had occupied Chinar Rahdar and Bagh-i-Jannat (recently vacated by our troops) and other gardens and villages, about five miles west of the town, and on the 11th, Colonel | Orton took out a column and drove them beyond Chinar Rahdar. As the f column returned to Shiraz the same day, the enemy followed up, and re-occupied the gardens from which they had been driven. The water-supply of the town was partially cut, with the result that not enough flour could be ground either for the town’s consumption or for the troops. It now appeared that there was a great lack of currency in the Bank, and arrangements were made to bring down a caravan of specie from Ispahan.yjgwnp The situation at Abadeh also appeared very threatening. The Soulat-es- Sultaneh, another brother of the Illkhani, seemed inclined to assist and I asked the Officer Commanding there to give him an assurance of our friend liness towards him. Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashgai, a cousin of the Soulat, and ^-Deputy Governor there, appeared before the town, and engaged in conversation with the Officer Commanding, but it was appnrent that his intentions were doubtful, if not actually hostile. Major Fraser had some days previously reported that the South Persia Rifles at Abadeh were fairly reliable, and had all taken the same oath of allegiance as the force in Shiraz. Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashquli, at this time gave us assurances of his intention to help, and the Kawam, with my approval, sent him a small supply of cartridges, while I sent him a sum of 2,000 tomans. June 15th. —No proof of Fath-ul-Mulk’s complicity in the Khaneh Zinian plot having been discovered, he was released and sent away from Shiraz. ^ On the night of the 14th—15th, our one outpost in the valley, Kushk-i-Kawami, about two and-a-half miles away, was heavily attacked, but the enemy were repulsed. A few shots were fired into cantonments the same night by snipers,—the only occasion on which any attempt was made to disturb the tranquility of cantonments. The outpost was reinforced the next day. The bazaars and the Imperial Bank of Persia were closed on the 15th and considerable excitement was caused by the Mullas preaching against the Kafirs. Cholera, which had been prevalent in the town for months, now took toll from the garrison, one British officer, a British non-commissioned officer and several Indian rank and file died. June 16th.—A. column under Orton again went out and drove the enemy from the Bagh-i-Jannat, Kushan, &amp;c., to beyond Chinar Rahdar, but on our retirement the enemy again followed up, and pressed attacks closely. Enemy are estimated to have lost heavily, and our own casualties, killed and wounded, amounted to thirty-one, including among the latter Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer and Captain Murray of the Burma Mounted Rifles. The enemy’s spirit was by no means broken by the punish- June l?th. ment they received, for the next day the &lt; I, i^. 1 . , . ^ announcement was made in the pulpits that the Kashgai losses in the engagement were one killed and four wounded!

The bazaars were in a state of ferment, and Indians, South Persia Rifles thWay Governor ' General 8 0WD troops were insulted and mobbed during General Sykes this day reported in his telegram No. 179—KH-G that in his opinion the Farman Farma and the Kawam were not doing their best to restore order, with the idea of forcing the hands of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and securing for themselves compensation for their losses' and large “terTvents 8 ! 0118 ' VleW ’ in 0 P inion * is Dot justifiable in the light of . In ® he afternoon. His Highness suggested to the Staff through me that various strong points in the town should be occupied by the troops and after some demur, the suggestion was accepted. During the nighf’three June isth. points in the town were occupied by 7^ tU.^ ° f -Sts^e^o tu^S On the 17th, affairs seemed to have reached a priHnai c.+« t. qgcupation of the town had a wondertul pflWr fgUi a 1C - s ^ a o e &gt; hut the aciture or flight of a f S w of the 3^% ^few days. During the following night telegraphic communication north was interrupted by a party of Kashgais under Ali Khan. This party also possessed themselves of the post of Bajgab, the garrison of about thirty-four surrendering after one of their number had been killed. Thirty-four rifles, ammunition and a fairly large amount of supplies fell into the enemy’s hands. Owing to some looting by South Persia Rifles in the town, and the distrust of that force by the Kawam and the Governor-General, one of the posts in the town occupied by the South Persia Rifles was handed over to an Indian detach ment. The bazaars were now opened, though very little business was doing. June 20th .—On the 20th, the outpost of Khushk-i-Kawami (Afifabad) was withdrawn, and there now remained no outpost with the exception of a small tower, a few hundred yards from the perimeter, occupied for prevention of sniping. June 22nd —The column went out a short distance from cantonments on the 22nd and shelled various posts said to be held by the enemy. Orders were sent to the South Persia Rifles garrison at Zarghun, about 26 miles distant on the Ispahan road to evacuate the post and retire on Shiraz, but only nine men reached Shiraz. June 24th .—The water-supply of the town was completely cut off, and great difficulties were experienced in consequence. June 26th .—On the 26th, a party of the Kawam’s men guarding the hills to the north of the town were attacked by the enemy, but easily drove them off. June 27th .—Next day the column made a demonstration on the hills immediately north-west of the town, and returned to cantonments for breakfast. It appeared that there was a great scarcity of food for the troops notwith standing that I had handed over to the Supply and Transport about 150 tons of wheat and flour which had been received from India for the consumption of the poor of the town. This amount was said to be sufficient for the con sumption of the whole force for a month. Colonel Orton and Lieutenant- Colonel Grant informed me of the very serious situation, and said that in a very short time it might be necessary to send away the mounted portion of our troops, Indian and South Persia Rifles. I pointed out that to get rid of Indian troops and to keep disloyal South Persia Rifles would appear to be foolish. In the meantime, I said I would make such efforts as were possible j!jne 29th to secure supplies. Two days after, I was officially reprimanded by General Sykes for “ failure to assist 99 in procuring supplies, but this matter forms the subject of a separate report. July 2nd .—On the 2nd July, with the agreements made between the Kawam and the new Illkhani and Illbegi of the Kashgais, the situation had entirely changed. Very few Kashgais now remained with Soulat, and the Kaze- runis also left the valley. South Persia Rifles were now the only really dangerous factor in the situation, and that all was not well with that force was proved by the theft during the night of the 3rd/4th of a machine gun, with a supply of ammunition and spares. The Kawam now issued a proclamation to his Arab tribes to the effect that in future the suppression of disturbances among them would be left in his own hands or in those of the Governor-General, and that only in the event of their failure to restore order would the British forces be called upon. A note was added to the effect that robbers on the road would in any case be punished by the military forces, South Persia Rifles or Indian troops, but that no force would be sent into the tribal country by the British without, in the first place, putting the matter before the Kawam. To this proclamation, as also to the proclamation issued to the Kashgais to the same effect, General Sykes signified his assent. i Jidy 6th .—On July 6th, three Persian officers and eleven men of the South Persia Rifles of the Khaneh Zinian garrison were executed,—the firing party being composed of Persians,—in the presence of a large number of Indiau troops. Gn this day,, a combined action of our forces with those of our “ allies”, the Kawam’s men and Kashgais, against Soulat, was arranged. General Sykes16 agreed to lend some rifles and give some ammunition to the Kawam and the Sirdar Ehtesham, who should take out a force to operate on our flank, and on the evening of the 7th our column marched out, the allies starting before dawn on the Jnly7th * 8th. During the night our force was attacked, but drove off the assailants, and in the morning advanced into the hills, driving off the enemy. The pursuit was taken up by the friendly Kashgais, and Soulat and his men disappeared in the direction of Eiruza- bad. The troops returned to Shiraz the same day. The machine gun stolen by the South Persia Pifles maxim detachment was brought back on the 7th by one of the Kawam’s men, who reported that he came across the South Persia Pifles deserters removing it. On the 8th, a messenger from Abadeh arrived, bringing the news that the South Persia Pifles garrison had revolted, that Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashgai, had attacked the town, and that the Indian detachment was defending itself there. Prom later reports it appeared that Soulat-es-Sultanek had joined the enemy, and that the combined enemy forces had made deter mined efforts to reduce the small garrison of Indian troops, but had been beaten off with small losses on our side on each occasion. July 9th .—The next day. General Sykes in my presence informed the Governor-General that he was sending a column under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams to relieve Abadeh, and arranged with the Kawam for guides, &amp;o., to avoid trouble with the tribes en route. It was stated by General Sykes at this interview that Colonel Williams would probably reinstate the Deputy Governor of Abadeh, who had been forced to leave that place. Arrangements were made for the departure of the column the following evening, but it actually started at daybreak the next morning. July 10th .—I was not informed, nor am I at present aware of what arrangements are being made for the future garrisoning of Abadeh, or whether the place is being abandoned. (I have since been informed that both Abadeh and Dehbid are being evacuated temporarily.—H. G.) On the 9th, the troops in occupation of the town were withdrawn,—the city having remained perfectly quiet. July 11th .— It was arranged that the Kawam should join Sirdar Ehtesham in camp with a view to attacking Soulat, while the Parman Parma should move out a column in a south-easterly direction to threaten Soulat’s flank, General Sykes agreeing to send out a squadron of Indian Cavalry with the Governor-General as a moral support. On the 15th, the Kawam started into camp, and on the 16th the Governor-General. July 17th .—The General Staff on the 16th and 17th ordered the censor ship of all military news for a fortnight, especially news passing between Shiraz and Abadeh, which was ordered to be sent to the General Staff before being passed on to any person whatever, and the Superintendent, Indo- European Telegraph Department, was informed that the order was applicable against myself equally with other persons. July 10^.—News was received from Lieutenant-Colonel Williams that his relieving column had reached Abadeh,—a distance of 180 miles in 169 hours, the garrison was found all well, except that one British officer had been killed and one wounded, and one British Sergeant had died of cholera, and ten casualties among the Indian garrison. tfuly 22nd. The situation as it now stands is that the Soulat, with a small following of perhaps 500 men is near Piruzabad. The Kazerunis under Nasr-i-Diwan aie at Kazerun. The hostile forces at Abadeh have been broken up and are scattered. Soulat*es-Sultaneh has fled in the direction of Isphan, and Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashgai, is dead of cholera. There is, however, a lar° , e gathering of presumably hostile Kashgais north of and not far from Abadeh. The Kawam, the ^ newly appointed Illkhani and the Illbegi, with a force of Arabs and Kashgais, paid by me from Government funds, are facing the Soulat near Piruzabad, and news is daily expected of fighting in that direction. The Governor- General with his own troops, Government troops, tribal levies (paidby me) and with the moral support of a squadron of Indian cavalry, is also out in camp, threatening the flank of the Soulat’s forces. The Indian garrison, with the exception of the column sent to Abadeh, and the squadron with the Governor-General, is in cantonments in Shiraz, and the first echelon of reinforcements from Bunder Abbas is said to have arrived at Saidabad. Telegraphic communication with the north was restored on the 20th though the line will not be in good working order probably for some weeks, as much damage has been done. In this connection I desire to bring to notice the valuable work performed by Mr. E. B. Newton, Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Shiraz, and his staff, both European and Armenian, and especially the work performed by Mr. Nevarra of the Department who has performed some very good work in keeping up communication with Colonel Williams , column on the march to Abadeh. Extract from a letter from Ayaz Kikha Kalantar of Barashuris (KashgaisJ Zabit of Lirawi, dated the8th Rabi-m-Sani 1336 (22nd January 1918J* (received Bushire 3rd February 1918), I thank you very much for the news you sent me about the European War. But each of these newspaper editors belongs to some group of powers, and is bound to write about the groups, victories and successes. As all the newspaper editors follow the policy of some faction or other, what they write cannot be trusted. However, we have nothing to do with the truth or falsity of what they write. Let them entertain such beliefs as they do entertain. I request you to send me regularly any news that you may receive about the war in Europe and the victories of any of the nations. News from Tehran, however, according to a report received here is that the Cabinet of Ministers has been changed. His Boyal Highness Ain-ed-Dowleh was Premier at the beginning but was soon dismissed and Mustaufi-ul- Mamalek was appointed Prime Minister. The Cabinet is composed of some patriotic statesmen among them being Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh. In the Kermanshah region there is no fighting with the Bussians who have left the soil of Persia. The Russian soldiers sold their articles and handed their arms over to the Gendarmes, and proceeded to their own country. According to news received, the Russians have now no influence or power in Tehran, Ispahan and other parts of Persia. The German and Turkish Consuls have arrived in Tehran, and Mirza Ahmad Khan, who is a Persian patriot, has come somewhere between Tehran and Tankabin with a force of 8,000 men and two guns, restored order in the Government offices in Resht and Enzeli. They send us the welcome news of the freedom of our country from the aggression of foreigners. We should wait and see what will be the wish of God. Although the reports contained in the newspapers cannot be believed, they contain news of the victories of the German and Turkish armies on the frontiers of Russia. We do not know how far these reports are true. Please send me any news you see in th6 newspapers. Copy of a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel H. Gough, His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, to the Soulat-ed-Dowleh, written on the 18th May 1918. Before leaving Shiraz, I wish to write Your Excellency a personal letter, as several things have recently occurred which I have no doubt have considerably disturbed you. In the first place, you will have heard of the affair at Khaneh Zinian, which was occasioned in the first place by the theft of some donkeys belonging to the South Persia Rifles by the Darashuris, which was followed by the arrest of the robbers and the recovery of the stolen animals. Tho Darashuris then attacked and in their turn were attacked by the South Persia Rifles and driven off and severely punished.18 Ifc is incidents like the above that make the British authorities inclined to think that Your Excellency has not sufficient power oyer the big sections of the Kashgais, and their Chiefs, and, if Your Excellency •will allow me, I wish to advise you, as your sincere friend, to punish such headmen and tribes as bring such disgrace upon Your Excellency. It is well known that the Kashgais are in the habit of robbing as they pass through the country side, but Your Excellency, who is a man of much perception, will understand that the times are much changed since two years ago, when there was no force to punish robbers or evil-doers. Now, when these robberies take place and the country is rendered unsafe for trade, such people will most assuredly be punished, and I have sufficient confidence in Your Excellency to believe that you understand this and will yourself take measures to prevent a conflict between your tribes and the military forces in the country. Your Excellency is well aware that we, the British, have not the remotest intention of remaining in this country after the conclusion of the war, but while the war lasts we are here and we have every intention of seeing that the country is not disturbed either by foreign enemies or by local robbers. Our first and last object is to preserve peace and order in Persia, and to prevent enemies from disturbing that peace. I assure Your Excellency that we have no quarrel with you, but as Illkhani, we hope and trust you will see the necessity of curbing your tribes and insisting on their behaving in a lawrabiding manner. Agaim if I may give Your Excellency advice, I would suggest that it would be wise to realise that the best method of showing that you are a true patriot and well-wisher of your own country, is to take such steps that the country over which Your Excellency is appointed by the Almighty and the Persian Government to be the ruler, should be in a state of perfect security, and that the revenues due from your country should be paid to the Persian Government. I hope Your Excellency will at least see that the advice I tender to you is absolutely disinterested, and that it is given in my sincere desire for your own welfare. I have also heard from Mirza Bohani that Your Excellency not long ago received a letter from General Sykes, to the effect that he had cannons and ample means to reduce any opposition on the part of any possible enemies, and that Your Excellency’s mind was somewhat disturbed at the idea that the message was a veiled threat against yourself. I have not heard from General Sykes that he has written to you in this sense, but it is undoubtedly true that he now has the power to dispose of any force that might oppose our policv, and in any case I beg Your Excellency to understand that his letter (if such letter was written) is not in any way directed against you or any other person in particular. l I wish to impress upon Your Excellency that the British have one desire only at heart, and that is to maintain peace and order in Southern Persia at all costs, and for that end, we will not hesitate to punish, if necessary, any countr ^ perS0DS ma5r be worki]Q g Awards upsetting the peace of the •7 * ^ t ^’ 0 . c ? n &lt;=Me, I again venture to hope that Tour Excellency will realise that it is m your own interest and in ours that you should maintain a strict hold on your tribes, and to effect this, we will assist you in every way I have spoken to His Highness the Earman Earma on the subject, and am givino* im a copy of this letter. I trust Your Excellency will take these parting words m the sense in which I write them, that of a true friend who has a sincere intention of wishing you well and also desires the good of the country. Translation of a document given by His Excellency the Kawam-ul-Mulk to Sirdar Ektesham and Salar-i-Heskmat on the 2nd July 1918. I, Mirza Ibrahim Khan, Kawam-ul-Mulk, give my word and nromise to assist and agree m every way with Sirdar Ehtesham and Salar HeshmaLI will obtain adequate assurances from the British authorities through the Governor-General for those Kashgai tribes, their Kalantars and Kadkhodas who obev Sirdar Ehtesham and Salar Heshmat not to be molested. I will also use my influence with (lit. will also satisfy) the British authorities so that they shall not interfere directly in Kashgai affairs. Should any disorder arise subversive to the peace of the country for which the Kashgais are responsible, the Governor-General will instruct the Illkhani to restore order, and it is the duty of the Illkhani to prevent every kind of disturbance and to punish robbers and evil-doers. Should Sirdar Ehtesham fail in doing this, or should he be unable to do so, he should inform the Governor- General and ask for his assistance to punish the culprits. Should this expedient also fail, the force stationed in Ears will take the necessary action with the cognizance of the Governor-General and the Illkhani. It is one of the duties of Sirdar Ehtesham and Salar Heshmat to keep the Kashgai tribes in perfect order, and also to prevent them making disturbances during their spring and autumn migrations. They should also maintain the security of the trade routes, and prevent robberies or them. If these conditions are observed, I promise and undertake to help and assist Sirdar Ehtesham and Salar Heshmat and to preserve their integrity (? respect their position). Any of the Kashgai tribes who do not give in their submission to Sirdar Ehtesham and Salar Heshmat are excepted from this and should not expect any assistance from me in the event of £heir suffering losses or meeting dangers. ' Translation of a document drawn up by Sirdar Ehtesham and All Khan, Salar-i-Heshmat, on the 2nd July 1918. We, Sirdar Ehtesham and Salar-i-Heshmat, now call upon God as our witness and take oath in His presence, to be faithful servants to the Persian Government and to be loyal to the Governor-General. We further undertake to do our utmost to restore order among the Kasbgai tribe?, and restrain them from every kind of aggression, and oppression of the country and the peoples, especially on commercial routes, the opening of which is the only means of securing order, tranquility of the general public, expansion of trade, increase of wealth, and the extension of communications with other parts of the country. His Excellency the Kawam-ul-Mulk will do all in his power to help us in this, and we will listen to his advice and will take no steps in opposition to his wishes. Should any difference in opinion arise with regard to the tribes, which we cannot solve, we will refer it to the Kawam-ul-Mulk, and will abide by his decision. The Kawam will ask the British authorities, through the Governor- General, and obtain their assurance that they will not interfere^ directly in Kashgai affairs. Should any disorders arise, which God forbid, or should any thing unforeseen occur, they (the British) should first approach the Governor-General, who will direct the Illkhani to restore peace and order. In the event of our being unable to comply with the Governor-General’s orders for the maintenance or restoration of order and the punishment of the offenders, we will claim the Governor-General’s assistance, as is the custom of the country. Should the Governor-General’s efforts prove unavailing, the force garrisoned in Shiraz will, with the cognizance of the Governor-General, and of the Illkhani, take such action as may be necessary.20 144 No. C.-34, dated Meshed, the 1st (received 27th) August 1918 (Confidential). ^ From— Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, To—The Hon'ble Sir Hamilton Grant, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. In continuation of my telegram No. 167, dated the 21st July, I have the honour to submit a further report on our famine relief work, which closed on the 10th ultimo after having contiuued for more than five months with a brief interval in May. 2. The arrangements described in paragraph 3 of my letter No. C.-12, dated the 19th April, continued for about a month longer, during which time distress was at its height, and bread more and more expensive and difficult to obtain. The number of people fed rapidly rose during the latter part of April to 6,000 daily; the record at this Consulate being over 6,500 : and the daily expenses amounted at this time to anything up to 500 tomans according to the number fed, and the actual price of bread which was sometimes as high as one toman per 6^ lbs. Another 10,000 tomans arrived from America late in April and we were able to continue up to the middle of May, when work at this Consulate was stopped, partly owing to sickness among the staff, much of which was the direct result of the work, and partly to lack of funds. On the 29th May at the personal request of the late Dr, Esselstyn, who had just received a further remittance of 8,000 tomans, we reopened at a selected spot outside the town : the Mission Hospital having closed about the 25th May, owing to the illness of the two Missionaries and most of their employes. Thenceforward the work continued uninterruptedly until the 10th July, when it was abandoned : the price of bread having fallen and other indications showing that further relief measures were unnecessary. 3. At least a thousand lives have been saved, in addition to the relief given to very many more hungry people, and the efforts made to lighten distress have been very greatly appreciated. The present satisfactory attitude, not only of the general Meshed public but also of many officials and other persons of consequence towards ourselves, is no doubt largely the result of the firm stand on our side taken by the new Governor-General, but the success of our relief measures has also contributed to it. 4. A copy of this letter will be sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, for information. «62 1918 2Heta] | ^ (Received with Army Department memomidum No. 10889, dated the 14th August 1918.)

In Abadeh it was openly stated that Lundenberg was offering inducements to ex-gendarmes to join at Tehran his force which Persian Government recognised, after deserting with horses, arms and equipment. Reported by a pa an who returned from leave in Tehran shortly before the rebellion that Lundenberg’s gendarmerie was being increased and that he was asked to desert South Persia Rifles and join Lundenberg as he had been a Vakil of Swedish gendarmerie. During the siege Sultan Kazem Khan called the mutineers “ Gendarmerie Governmental ” and resumed all Swedish procedure and bugle calls. He also claimed promotion to Yavar on the authority of a letter from a Yavar of Lundenberg’s whose name is believed to be Path Ali. Sultan Sayyid Jawad Khan having been on leave in Tehran was due back in April but remained absent and addressed Persian officers at Abadeh by letter, stating that he intended to join Lundenberg. 65 Telegram, No. 1081, dated the 13th (received 14th) August 1918.

Views of Governor-General are :— It will be best if military take the matter into their own hands and carry matter through. If not, Governor-General is prepared to himself undertake matter provided the services of Persian forces is paid for by us and we lend him some assistance in the matter of some rifles and ammunition and of guns. It would be best, in my opinion, to undertake with our own forces the necessary operations if it is considered possible, and I agree with Sykes that if Persian Government pould be persuaded to take some such steps as asked for by Sykes' difficulties would be enormously decreased.

From—The General Officer Commanding, South Persia Rifles, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I refer to No. 28 of 13th from Minister, Tehran. I made no such state ment as that attributed to me and there must be some misunderstanding. The principle that maintenance of law and order, collection of revenue, &amp;c., lie in the hands of the Governor-General has not been resisted by me. The conclusion (presumably ?) is not correct. Apparently my words have been misconstrued. The following sentence is a relative sentence introduced by the preposition “as ,, : M As maintenance of law and order, collection of revenue, &amp;c., lie in the hands of the Governor-General. M The main sentence which contains the principle is as follows: “ The latter is strongly averse to the control of road being in the hands of a body of men not appointed or paid by himself.” The relative sentence and the consequent rhetoric enunciated leads apparently to the following logical deductions. ’ Therefore Parman Parma objects to the presence of South Persia Rifles troops along the north, south and other roads. The argument can be logically carried out further, namely, therefore Parman Parma objects to the presence of South Persia Rifles troops at Shiraz and also to the presence of Indian troops in Pars. After all this is the Persian contention. It is the contention which has actuated the Persian Govern ment. In the form of instructions to Persian officials and tribal chiefs it has been passed. The recent outbreak and attacks against Indian troops was caused by it. In Pars it has mainly undermined and already partly destroyed South Persia Rifles. If this principle is not to be resisted by me I am placed, I consider, in a false position and that in this case it remains only to withdraw all Indian troops from Pars and disband all South Persia Rifles in Pars. Baldly put I consider the self preservation and main tenance of the troops under my command are required by British military interests and British policy. Destruction of South Persia Rifles and the eviction of Indian troops is the aim of Persian policy. Parman Parma yesterday enunciated this principle and declared it to be fundamental. His difficulties are immensely enhanced by the fact but Parman Parma has shown, in recent crisis, positive genius in his diplomatic efforts on our behalf as I have pointed out in my letters. Recurrence of recent trouble is likely. There are dissensions among chiefs of Kashgais confederacy as was to be expected. S ulat continues to be our main danger and is collecting a new following. Dividing the Indian troops by sending a strong column to Abadeh is dangerous. The Darashuris must by the begin ning of October migrate from Abadeh to Behbehan and Abadeh situation will be eased thereby.4 72 No. 1881, dated Simla, the 12th August 1918. From—S ib, M. Davood Khan, Consul-General for Persia, To—The Hon’ble Sib Hamilton Grant, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the ^ Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I enclose herewith the text of a telegraphic communication received by me from the Foreign Office at Tehran regarding the annulation of all treaties, conventions, concessions, &amp;c., concluded with the Russian Government and subjects during the past hundred years. From the enclosed you will see the Persian Government’s intention regarding their new relations with the Russian Government as well as with the other Powers. Translation of a telegram from the Persian Foreign Minister to the address of the Persian Consul-General at Simla, dated the 5th August 1918. As all treaties, concessions and conventions, which the former despotic Government of Russia and the subjects of that Government had obtained from the Persian Government during the last century were exacted by force and under pressure by unlawful means such as threats and temptations and were opposed to the interests of the (Persian) nation and empire, and considering that from the beginning of the present war the great Powers have declared and are declaiming by different means in writing their intentions of protecting and safeguarding the integrity and independence politically as well as commercially of weak nations ; also in view of the fact that the new Russian Government is desirous of having as its aim complete independence of nations and has particularly declared in detail the annulment of all official and un-official treaties and concessions which had been obtained from the Persian Govern ment ; similarly in view of the fact that the said treaties and agreements and concessions having been obtained by force and pressure in opposition to the interests of the Persian Empire and those that were obtained after the announcement of constitutional Government in Persia were exacted clearly in contravention of the laws of the country and have either not been carried out or have been most defectively and irregularly enforced, since they were detrimental to the political and commercial interests and needs of the Persian nation, the Persian nation and Government have the right, like other Govern ments, to take advantage of its independent and natural resources. Therefore the Persian Government has resolved to annul all concessions agreements and treaties, and the Persian Foreign Minister has communicated this determination [of the Persian Government] in his letter of the 22nd Shawal (corresponding to 31st July 1918) to the Legations of all Governments at Tehran in which he has explained that the Persian Government is determined to base its relations with the Russian and other Governments on commercial treaties in accordance with the needs of the present time so that they may have in view the interests of both parties equally and this resolution will be carried out gradually. I have considered it necessary to inform you of the matter so that you may communicate it in writing with the views of the Persian Government to the Government at whose headquarters your are residing and may explain the points that you may consider necessary. I shall keep you informed of further proceedings in the matter. 75 Telegram P., No. 704, dated the 15th (received 16th) August 1918.

General situation is somewhat as follows :— The Khans of Borasjun and Ohahkutah, the former of whom has collected 200 riflemen from outlying villages, talk of resistance but their action will probably depend entirely on attitude of Zair Khidar of (?) Tangistan and they will do nothing without his active support. The action of Zair Khidar is much hampered by covert enmity or open hostilities of headmen under him. It is said he is trying to harass these ( * ) and the Dashti chiefs, with whom he has been corresponding, are reported to have offered him help. Consider it on the whole unlikely that Zair Khidar will at first offer any oppositionf to nea llon ‘ advance of troops, but if permitted will prefer to await developments, in which case Borasjun and Chahkutah will follow his lead. In my opinion, if terms are offered they should be such as implied complete submission and include reparation for past(;) failing to accept, Khans should be dispossessed and other rulers should be appointed. * One group corrupt. 85 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 11184, dated the 20th August 1918.)

Sufficient evidence is available here that a Doctor Nasir Begoff, a Caucasian Turk and Russian subject, has pro-enemy views to which he gives expression, occasionally at least, also that he is working here for Ban- Islamism. I am of opinion, and General Malleson agrees, that for the period of the war he should be deported. My colleague declines to believe the evidence before him and holds that the Doctor is the victim of an intrigue, and therefore objects. But the evidence is too varied and too strong for that. May I arrest and send man to India ? No trouble will he made by Russian Consul-General. With his approval two other Caucasians of low class are being arrested for anti-ally work and views. Will you kindly arrange for their reception. 30 Telegram P., No. 77, dated the 6th (received 8th) August 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Following is present situation :— Soulat with a few attendants is reported to have gone down to plains pursued by Ali Kban and Mahomet Khan, Kashkuli. At Firuzabad Sirdar Ehtesbam is arranging tribal affairs. The Kawam has returned here. Arrangements for merchandise being brought in from Kazerun are being made by Governor-General. He is making use of Nasred Diwani’s services (this does not affect our relations in any way with Nasred Diwani but having regard to extreme importance of the large amount of goods lying there being brought in, it is considered advisable to take no steps against it at present if other methods are successful: Kashkulis may, possibly, however, attack Kazerun on their own account). Of situation further south or whether Dashtis, &amp;c., intend to oppose advance from Bushire I have no news. Certainly a number of them came to help Soulat when he was defending Firuzabad, but these went off when he was defeated. I have very little information of situation in direction of Abadeh and Debbid beyond news sent in by Williams from north. At Abadeb a temporary Deputy Governor has at the request of William (in which I concur) been appointed by Governor-General. He is not however likely to prove efficient for a long time and it will become necessary to make other arrange ments. Guarding of road north of Sivand is in hands of Tufangchis appointed by Williams and even paid by South Persia Rifles. Maintenance of law and order, collection of revenue, &amp;c., being in the Governor-General’s hands he is strongly averse to the control of the roads being made over to a body of men he has not appointed or is not paying. Governor-General is addressing Sirdar Ehtesham about prospective arrangements for restoration of order on Sarhad which includes tribal territory up to the frontiers of Ears and Abadeh, and Ali Khan Ilibegi to exercise authority and control will probably shortly proceed there. From the political necessities point of view it is a pity that garrisons could not be left in Abaded and Dehbid, but in this matter military necessities are paramount. Generally speaking, neither Kashkuli or Arabs are in the least likely to oppose our forces as the lllkhani and Kashkuli are both definitely committed Jfcp us and among their tribesmen have guaranteed to keep order. On the other hand, we have assented to agreement that tribes will not be attacked2 •without first, except in cases of highway robbery, requesting Illkhani or Kashkulis, respectively, to punish their offenders. It remains for us to help them in everyway to carry out their promises. There is no cause to expect any conflict with either Kashkulis or Arabs, unless another combination takes place against Sirdar Ehtesham, so far as I can see, contingency must be guarded against however. Kawam and Sirdar are still being paid for by me for maintenance of the forces now pursuing Soulat, &amp;c., but some have already been discharged and remainder will as soon as possible be paid up. There is no agitation in town and local situation is very good. Revenues are beginning to come in, but much loss has been caused by late troubles. This refers to your telegram of July 31st, No. 86.

Reference telegram 895 of 5th, from Foreign. I am handicapped in matter of representations Gough may have made regarding my relations with Farman Farma and other matters as Gough has not given me copies. Gough’s relations with Farman Farma are easy. He pays him large sums and rarely presses Farman Farma hard to get anything done. I am in the gay position of constantly having to get things done and arranged, and have managed without assistance from Gough even in simple matters like local supplies of cattle transport which have been essential for operations and for passage of reinforcements. For instance, Gough’s unwillingness to press Farman Farma in the question of supplies nearly brought us in the recent crisis to verge of break down. Gough also informs Farman Farma of adverse criticisms made by me m my confidential telegrams. In spite of this my relations with Farman Farma are good and friendly. I am an old friend of the entire family and the two sons in Shiraz are m full sympathy with me and render me valuable assistance. I realise great value of Farman Farma’s services and give him full credit, but it ri gJ lt to report when he fails to help me. Essential differences between North-West Frontier, India and Fars are as follows: + r ® inforcements can arrive in day or two in case of serious trouble, but in Fars they cannot. u s (6) Troops in Fars are small isolated force in midst of a numerfius well- armed and fanatic population whose attitude is hostile at heart and whose Farm n n a i a d n SSe r i0D -!iT d } ealousl ? s are am0n S our principal safeguards. Farman S^^ aVOld ^ Vm ? t0 - intrl S ue with the rival factions and it is like playin 0 with fire. When his intrigues go wrong we bear the brunt.3 (e) Since Christmas an anti-Soper and anti-British campaign of extreme virulence has been carried on from Tehran and all evidence points to the chief engineers being Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh and Eaqr-us-Sultaneh, the German legation and also the Swedish officer, Lunberg. This factor is absent from frontier of India. * The local political control has remained in hands of Gough throughout, and there is nothing for me to hand over. During the recent crisis I pressed on two or three occasions for certain action being taken, but even then nothing was done through the correct channel, namely, Gough. I realise that political control in Persia is extremely complex as Persia is a neutral country. I realise the * * * (? inherent) diplomatic difficulties in allotting definite local political control in my hands. I have, however, definitely submitted my view and I accept the policy as now decided. I wish now only to point out that my position remains a complex and difficult one and that there is an element of risk in singular military situation due to political factor over which I have no control. I request that it may be recognised that in abnormal circumstances my responsibility for the lives and safety of the troops under my command is correspondingly diminished as compared with the ordinary case of a General Officer Commanding a force in the field.

Consul states :— Begins. As the maintenance of law and order, collection of revenue, &amp;c., lies in hands of Governor-General, the latter is averse to control of road being in hands of body of men not appointed or paid by himself. Ends. Thisjis enunciation of what I described as the Farman Farma or Persian policy as opposed to what I regarded as British policy. It is this under-lying Persian official influence which has mainly undermined and already partly destroyed South Persia liifles in Pars during past few months. As Inspector-General, South Persia Fifles, I have resisted this principle, because I understood clearly its logical result and I held it to be the intention of British Government to maintain South Persia Fifles force which had been organised. Government of India in telegram, 895, August 5th, has placed northern and southern roads under Farman Farma and consular control. Femainder of South Persia Fifl.es in Fars now collected at Shiraz cannot easily continue to exist under the overpowering pressure of principle now openly enunciated and accepted. Persian ranks of South Persia Fifles in Fars have understood this for several weeks past and have recently become restless and discouraged. They have only been kept in hand by the utmost endeavours of British officers. The feeling of discouragement however has spread lately■ l?x ~ 4 to British officers and especially British instructors. Barman Parma’s Shiraa Nazmieh police have always been unfriendly towards South Persia Rifles and during past few days have started fresh campaign of false accusations. If Persian influence and perfidious policy be permitted to destroy South Persia Rifles in Pars it seems probable that the same process will next be extended to the Kerman Brigade. In view of turn of tide in Prance as exemplified by re-appointment as premier of Yossuq, who officially recognised South Persia Rifles in March 1917, it seems desirable to come to a decision. If the Persian Government again officially recognise South Persia Rifles force will during war be so useful a body of men as can be raised provided Persian officials be friendly towards it. The use of levies under local authorities is a reversion to bad old system which proved unpracticable many years ago. Addressed to the Chief of the General Staff; repeated Tehran, 36 Telegram P., No. 690, dated the 10th (received 11th) August 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Immediate settlement of South Persia Rifles question is anxiously sought for by Prime Minister. He said he could see no other than (?) in general acceptance of nomination of foreign officers. Request from His Majesty’s Government for services of Major Polcke and four or five others who were trustworthy would not be refused by Swedish Government. These officers could come to Persia and study problem of organising force on a scale of expenditure which Persia could bear eventually instead of on existing lavish scale before taking over South Persia Rifles and they could assume charge when they had evolved a practical proposal. Some of the British officers now in force might be retained, but for us to give immediate tangible proof that we meant to keep our engagement was the important thing. I said that piactical difficulties in the way of his proposal seemed to be enormous. Waiting for a revision of tariff to provide for additional revenue was excluded by terms of problem yet His Majesty’s Government could scarcely be expected to continue to bear the expense after control had passed into other hands. Nor could his proposals be regarded by military authorities as guaranteeing the military situation in South Persia. Pinancial difficulty was admitted by His Highness who however argued that there would be no military situation or at all events none that a ‘ s neutral ” gendermerie could not deal with but for existence of South Persia Rifles under British officers. I pointed out that this neutral Power to be effective depended, not on the small number of British officers who might remain in force but on Cabinet here. After experience of last three years could we depend on that ? His Hio-hness* rejoined that in that case for us to go on with continually increasing ourlforces which we could not desire was the only remedy. I told His Highness that in my opinign it did not offer practical solution but that as he made a point of it I would submit his suggestion to you. His Highness made one other observation which is worth noting, viz that he feared that not even most formal recognition of South Persia Rifles by the Persian Government would after recent events in Pars restore the loyalty of force for a long time to come and I am convinced it was not merely to forestall insistence (1 gr. undec.) on recognition that this opinion was^ ex pressed. His Highness said he would call in a few days and discuss other pending questions as he had not had time yet to go into them. 1 ° Addressed to fhe Poreign Office, London, 690; repeated Baghdad and $hir.az, •37 Telegram, No. 692, dated the 11th (received 12th) August 1918.

This morning Governor-General informed Sykes and myself that it would be better in his opinion to leave temporary arrangements for patrollino’ northern road already made by South Persia Rifles as'they stand until it is seen what steps new and friendly cabinet will take towards recognition on reconstitution of South Persia Rifles. He wishes it to be understood that he is not at all anxious to take action on safeguarding of road from military authorities so long as proper arrange ments can he made by them. Sykes takes exception to words italicised and remarks :— Begins. Before proper arrangements can be made to place detach ments along northern road to safeguard it, the recognition of South Persia Rifles, the friendly attitude of Persian Government towards that organisation and some punitive operations will be essential. In any ease as we have lost heavily in men, arms and equipment, abovementijned measures must take some time. We have to bear in mind the Kazerun question. Enas. The arrangements made already are purely temporary of course.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Shiraz situation. As I understand it. In creating the South Persia Rifles intention of His Majesty’s Government was, that force should be used for maintenance of security along trade routes and of general tranquility under nominal direction of Persian local authorities, i e., Governor-General in consultation with His Majesty's Consul, Indian troops being sent only to mother young force .during period of its formation. To-day, however, the two are concentratedI at Shiraz and neither force is able to fulfil its role. Farman Farm^ by whom combination which broke up Soulat-ed-Dowleh’s power appears to have been engineered, is entrusted with safety of roads north and south of Shiraz, while Kawam, and other tribal elements have been hunting down Soulat. That is to say we are falling back to old pernicious system which the formation of Swedish gendarmerie was intended to put an end to, viz., reliance on arrangements with tribal chiefs for maintenance of security. This in itself is regrettable or, as things are quiet now, at any rate is not creditable to us and is one of the potential dangers. To meet it, L consider our troops in Fars should be strengthened so as to enable them to deal adequately with any probable tribal combination, or in other words, to fulfil their original function imposing tranquility, until the South Persia Fifles are able to stand alone. As part of the measures already decided on, operation should, of course, be carried out at once, for without this not even the despatch of troops later will prove reassuring to Vossuq. As to the future of the South Persia Fifles at present we can, I think, do no more than shelve it by some arrangement such as that proposed by Vossuq, see my telegram No. 690 or that suggested in your telegram No. 347 of June 29th. The former is better from the point of view of soothing Persian sensi tiveness. For, a nominal chief, would, so long as his staff was wholly British, be regarded as being sold to us, even if suitable Persian could be found for the post. Presence of a Swedish chief w ? ould however be guarantee even in Persian eyes, that South Persia Frfies was no longer to be used as a force of auxiliaries’ to British troops for British as opposed to Persian purposes, as has too ofien seemed to be the case in the past. We should have to bear the cost in either case, but under the former scheme it should be possible to cut down expenses. Of the numberless difficulties that attend this- proposal I am well aw 7 are, but X think that an opportunity of coming to some arrangement that would serve to shelve question is provided by advent of Vossuq^ and that before it passes we should take advantage of it. I request instructions as soon as possible. Addressed to the Foreign Office, London repeated Baghdad. 42 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 10577, dated the 7th August 1918.)

The' Fesht affair, I presume, will be unknown- to populace here as apparently strict censorship of all postal and telegraphic communication at Shahrud.The fall of Baku is commonly expected. The Governor-General stated that such as eventuality would have undoubtedly an unfortunate effect across frontier and throughout Khorasan. He is of opinion that our forces here should be strengthened and guns added. Bor his own part he was ^ determined to use all the forces at his disposal to prevent any enemy crossing Persian frontier. He is very anxious that we should give 1,000 rifles to him. Be«arding Turcomens he said their attitude, like most peoples, would be affectedly fate of Baku. If Baku can hold out he is of opinion that propa ganda work against them, by qualified persons, would be very desirable, provided the latter confined attentions to their anathematising Turkish Buie and refrained from praising British Government. The Governor-General’s interests seem bound up with ours, and I talked fairlv freely to him. As regards his own position, he thought owing to cessa tion of intrigues against him at Tehran, and a possible change of Government, that it was much more secure. 46 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 104)23, dated the otli August 1918.)

When the news from Baghdad regarding the improved situation in Baku was received yesterday 1 immediately communicated it to Governor-General and other officials, to the Bussian colony here, and by telegraph to the friendly elements in Trans-Caspia. The effect has been great and gratifying and this morning the Governor-General said it would clear the air very much in our favour. ° Enemy agents and sympathisers who swarm here, have, for some time past, looked upon the fail of Baku as a matter of a few days only. The Bussian colony here were particularly gloomy regarding the possibility of our organising any resistance at this late hour and held the view that with the imminent appearance of enemy forces on the east side of the Caspian the British cause in Central Asia was dead. All this is now changed hy the new situation in Baku which greatly encourages our friends and correspond- ino-ly depresses our numerous enemies. It gives us fresh breathing space lor preparations, and the longer Baku holds out and the more, securely we hold the Caspian Elect the greater our chances- of organising resistance successfully. 49 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 10423, dated the 5th August 1918.)

The following extracts from a letter of a manager of a Bussian Bank in Askahad, dated July 23rd, are interesting and in accord generally with our information from other sources -.—Begins. The keynote of the movement in Trans-Caspia is undoubtedly connected with the movement against Bolshevism throughout all Bussia. All classes are combined against the tyranny of Commissaries^ Bolshevik power in Turkistan is in an inextricable confusion. The whole line from Orenburg to Tashkent was evacuated by the Bed Army under the pressure of Czecho- Slovacs. Bising in Trans-Caspia* and * lchaDge - Bokhara disturbed. Unfortunately, whilst Trans-Caspian Army (Mensheviks) have only rifles, Bed Army is enormously superior in equipment, possessing ambulance, machine g un s&gt; armoured cars, aeroplane and heavy artillery. Indescribable horrors will occur if Trans-Caspian Army is defeated, as Kolesov has pronounced the— ill!! H 8 death sentence in advance, on all participating in the rising. This terrible danger is fully realised here, and consequently reinforcements are being collected and pushed forward to Charjui with all speed. Mensheviks have decided to blow up the Charjui bridge in the case of dire necessity. Turco mans have promised Mensheviks support of ambulancemen, but a consider able danger is presented by the armament of so many Mahometans. Pan- # Islamism will find favourable soil and 1 cLange- we might subsequently be* confronted with Turcoman State. We all await the arrival of an English detachment at Askabad with impatience. 800 to 500 men would be sufficient and a tremendous impression would be produced throughout the country and the Trans-Caspian movement would be strengthened, whilst the strength of the detachment would be magnified to several thousands by rumour, thus alarming the ited Army. Letter ends. Latest advices from Trans-Caspia show reinforcements are still being sent eastward to Merv. Mensheviks are in possession of the Oxus bridge at Charjui, and the fighting is on the Bokhara side of the river. It is stated by local rumour that the Amir of Bokhara has declared against Bolsheviks. This has not vet been confirmed. 51 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 10423, dated the 5th August 1918.) Telegram P., No. M. D.-00128, dated the 1st (received 2nd) August 1918.

Their instructions were to get in touch with leaders in Trans-Caspia, both Armenian and Mensheviks, and to ascertain their views regarding resistance to Tureo-German advance in Caspian without committing themselves in any way. It is quite possible that the results of these efforts will be definite proposals from TransrCaspian leaders (for) our moral, financial and military assistance, and it is suggested that if important questions of policy have not already been decided, they should be considered now in order to enable me to give a prompt reply should I be approached. The following is submitted for consideration. We shall be openly opposing Bolsheviks by assisting leaders of Trans-: Caspian movement. Tnis may not be in accordance with the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government. As the Bolsheviks in Turkistan are not yet beaten, it may also mean putting our money on the wrong horse, and I think I discern a distinctly anxious note in the latest communications from Trans- Caspia. If the Bolsheviks in their rage against us might induce them to offer every possible facility to the Turco-German advance into Central Asia. We should also suffer great loss of prestige from being identified with losing cause and out numerous enemies in these parts might throw off the thin mask now worn and openly act against us. On the other hand, from such information as is available here, it would seem probable that the forces elsewhere throughout Asia against the Bolshe viks are so large and so increasing that in the long run they must go under + lph even ^ough their local suppression in Bakuf is temporarily postponed. The advantages from direct association with the leaders of the Trans-Caspian x chanCTe movement would be very great. We mighty stipulate for— (a) Access to Krasnovodsk and permission to put that place in a state of defence against attack from the sea. (b) Permission, should the necessity arise, to withdraw all the rolling stock over the whole of the Krasnovodsk to Merv and Kushk sections tq eastward of Osus.ritef -• u ; irg-— - ,-: ■_»«--».• riNfeflMHKHMSB&gt;#i ssc- ss^rr- r , .. 10 58 Telegram P., No. 82, dated the 12th (received 13th) August 1918.

I fear I do not see with you in this matter.

The armed men would be a hindrance to our aims, in the event of his disappearance, and should he remain they would add to his power to work against as well as with us. In short they would sharpen his claws. It may be noted that we gave 1,000 rifles to Shaukat-ul-Mulk and have had a poor return. So much is satislactory in his attitude not because we »ave him rifles; but because he owns his province, makes money out of us and we have policed his property against raids. As shown above this would not be the case with Kawam. Tne wise suggestion that arms are to be collected and returned in the event of Kawam’s removal, is one which Persian obstructive- ness could make very difficult to realise and if insisted on, might lead to fric tion and even to armed collision which we are desirous of avo?dino\ (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 10116, dated the 29th July 1918.)

We should soon know if this advice had been carried out, and if not followed further possible measures, including pressure from Tehran could be considered. ; (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 10045, dated the 27th July 1918.)

Orton and I are both of opinion that it is inadyisable to separate the Indian troops m Pars Kerman and Bandar Abbas from the South Pe^! Rifles command. As it is intended primarily for defence of th! n 1 / half battalion, 3rd Brahmans at Bandar Abbal should be undir the Bate% ^ mandant, who is the senior local South Persia Rifles officer. B Cow * The section of a Mountain Battery and the battalion 120th Tnf. t earmarked for Saidabad should come under the Officer Commanding T [ ? f - V ' Brigade, to ensure unity of command in an area which is dTstfn D and wV^ should, as far as possible, be self-contained and decentralized.’ l“ hp point is of importance m case communication with Shiraz is ; n i„. I y&gt;er recently happened for a whole month. wteirupted asAt Shiraz the Indian troops amount to a mixed brigade and they need a Brigadier an a brigade staff to ensure efficient administration and efficient handling and organization in the field. The Pars Brigade of the South Persia Rifles has recently been subjected to an unusual, unfair and peculiar strain—mainly political—and has been in the melting pot. I strongly hope that the Swedish gendarmerie dross has been, eliminated and that the surviving 1,400 South Persia Rifles of this brigade will become a better unit. Time and patience are required however before this can be proved. The separation of the Indian troops from the South Persia Rifles throughout Southern Persia would result in duplication of administration thus causing complications in the questions of munitions, personnel, supplies and convoys. It would also involve additional staffs and extra expense. The two services would certainly compete for available local resources, and so prices would be raised all round. Jealousy and friction would be inevitable moreover with two forces and two commands. The South Persia Rifles and the Indian troops are intended for use in furtherance of a common military and political local policy. Unity of com mand is essential therefore. Moreover the General Officer Commanding, Southern Persia, should not only continue to command all the troops in Southern Persia (both Indian and South Persia Rifles) but should in addition control directly all local political factors by which military operations may be affected or, by 'which the safety of the troops under his command may be affected. It follows therefore that the Consuls at Bandar Abbas, Kerman and Shiraz should be regarded as political assistants to the General Officer Commanding, Southern Persia, during the war. The Consul at Shiraz regards himself as an independent and separate political authority. Subject to the Minister, Tehran, he regards himself as holding powers to initiate and carry out local political activities and policies, entirely uncontrolled by the General Officer Commanding even during actual operations, and even with our enemies or potential enemies. I have made a protest to you, and I have recently posted copies of corre spondence and memoranda in proof of my contention. Under the peculiar circumstances obtaining in Southern Persia, both Orton and I consider that the nature of our problems are as much political as military. Personally I possess a wide experience of major and minor political factors in Persia and I possess sufficient military experience to dovetail military and political requirements to meet a local situation. The staffs of the South Persia Rifles brigades are efficient, and I have been given and expert military staff at Force Headquarters. During thd recent crisis the existing military system stood the strain very well. No large changes appear to be called for with the following exceptions First —temporary rank of Major-General to be granted to the Inspector-General, Bouth Persia Rifles. This, to give him sufficient standing to command total of Indian and South Persia Rifles troops in South Persia, and also to exercise local political control through the Consuls at Bandar Abbas, Kerman and Shiraz, who would be regarded as his political assistants. tfmwd—The grant of temporary rank of Brigadier-General to Colonel Orton as Deputy Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles. In addition he would act as Brigadier of the mixed Indian Brigade at Shiraz. A Brigade- Major and Staff-Captain for the Brigade would be selected locally. Whilst devoting most of his time to the Indian troops at Shiraz, Orton could be my Chief Military Adviser as at present. He and 1 have worked together har moniously in the past and I anticipate no difficulty in a continuance of that State.

It is my opinion that proposal would not involve us in any additional military liabilities. With our tardy help Zafar has done at least all that he undertook to do and has earned continuance of our support. Two mountain guns which we can apparently spare without difficulty and which we have already given him is all the help that he is likely to require. So long as our enemies believe we are ready to help him to this extent, they are not likely to make trouble. Probable trouble on Bakhtiari road has been greatly diminished by what he has already done. The best way of enabling him to form a party is to make it clear that we intend to strongly support him. When they under stand this his enemies who are also ours will probably come to heel and will learn that it is worth being friends with us. This refers to your telegram No. 201. .

In the above General Officer Commanding thoroughly concurs and wishes me to say that he would strongly deprecate any action by Governor-General, which could in any way tie bis hands.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. (B.) Persian Government has without warning denounced all treaties concluded with Russia and concessions granted to Russians within the last 10 years, on the grounds that they have all been brought about by force or fraud ; that the larger Powers have in the course of war announced their in tention of protecting weaker nations; that new Russian Government has officially and unofficially announced abrogation of all treaties and concessions obtained from Persia; that treaties and concessions (particularly those obtained after the declaration of Persian Constitution) have been inoperative or wrongly interpreted or their expressed obligations to Persia have not been observed. In communicating this to me, Persian Government requests me to inform His Majesty’s Government and add that in its desire for good relations with ail friendly Powers, Persian Government has decided on foundation for good relations bv entering into treaties, friendly and commercial, with such Powers as will meet Persia’s present necessities and safeguard common interests of both parties. (P.) It is intended by the Russian Minister to make a strong protest. The Shah has been informed personally by Russian Officer Commanding, Cossack Division, that as Bolshevik regicide Government has been recognised by Persian Government by this declaration, Russian officers can scarcely continue in its service. Moreover repudiation of agreement constituting Cossack Brigade destroys its character. The Shah declared he knew nothing of the measure and pretending to be very angry said he would, within three days, dismiss the Cabinet. His promises, however, should not be taken seriously. Pending your reply I intend replying merely that I am forwarding the papers to you and will, in due course, communicate reply of His Majesty s Government but that meanwhile I cannot recognise unilateral action of this kind.

Murtaza Quli Khan on receipt of news of trouble in Ears went out accompanied by a representative of Shihab-us-Sultaneh to meet Sirdar Soulat at Zifra on the way to Ardeshan. His pretext was that he was going for the benefit of his wife’s health to Garmab. It was proposed at the conference that 1,000 Bakhtiari sowars should be collected and that British should be attacked. All British establishments to be closed, I was to be arrested, and rest of us driven out of Ispahan. It was proposed that Sirdar Soulat should begin by attacking town Murtaza Quli Khan then joining in. Shihab-us- Sultaneh was to remain quiet on pretext that he was not responsible as he had resigned his post. To this arrangement Sirdar Soulat would not agree and insisted that Murtaza Quli Khan should begin, but latter declined as be knew that owing to precautions taken since threat to disarm and expel Persian Cossacks a shell would fall in his house on the first symptoms of a disturbance, and returned to Ispahan disappointed. He and Shihab-us- Sultaneh collected gangs of Biza Juzdani and Jafar Quli at Najafabad 20 miles west of town, reinforced them with 120 Bakhtiaris and were preparing to attack town but dispersed on hearing that Abadeh had been relieved. I communicated this information to Akbar. He called Murtaza Quli Khan and taxed him and Shihab-us-Sultaneh who were present with these designs. After protesting that they were innocent they were obliged to confess that accusation was true. Yesterday morning Murtaza Quli Khan left Ispahan. Bibi Mariam has opposed these plans from the first. She warned the two Khans that Soulat-ed-Dowleh’s defeat was certain and that other pro- German Bakhtiaris and herself had chosen the wrong side and must now hasten to make the best terms they could with us as we had a firm hold on Sirdar Zafar and would probably make (?) Bakhtiari while all other Khans would have to be content to sit at home, as they would be excluded from appointments. She has announced that she intends seeing me before leaving Ispahan and has sent for Munshi Bashi twice but I have refused to let him go and unless she writes and asks me to do so I shall not receive her. A very fine horse of hers was robbed two days ago by some of Jafar Quli’s men and some of her servants murdered. She is furious with Shihab-us-Sultaneh and his allies. At last she seems to be convinced that Germany will be beaten. Addressed Tehran, 202; repeated Baghdad, 53. 371 Telegram P., No. 642, dated the 24th (received 25th) July 1918.

If, His Majesty said, the Charge d’Affaires could be induced by Vossuq to formally disavow this, obstacle to his nomination would be removed. Of course Vossuq, though he has ascertained that declaration was never made, declined this mission, as well as an invitation to join Ain-ed-Dowleh in forming a Cabinet.

Valuable effect will be caused by demonstration of Bakhtiari co-operation doubtless. Government of India would like to know before considering IllkhanPs offer to raise 6,000 sowars whether he would expect us, firstly, to arm them; secondly, to contribute to their maintenance, and if so, to what extent; and thirdly, apart from co-operation against Kasbgais for what other purpose they could be employed.

July 4th .—Sanad was given by Governor-General to new Illkhani. Proclamations (which Sykes approved) have been issued both by Kawam and myself to the effect that in event of trouble amongst either Kashgais or Arabs, or should Kawam or Illkhani be unable to suppress it, Governor-General would be called on to deal with it. British military assistance would only be invoked in the event of Governor-General’s inability to do so. Our military forces would deal with robberies on high roads but would undertake no expedi tions into tribal territory without Governor-General’s previous knowledge, also that of Kawam or Illkhani where concerned. Machine Gun Team of 8 South Persia Bifles carried off a machine gun with spare parts and ammunition, but gun, without spare parts, was subse quently recovered by a Kashgai. Deserters escaped however and are said to have joined Soulat. July 6th .—Of Khaneh Zinian garrison three Persian officers and eleven men were executed. The firing party was provided by South Persia Bifles. July 7^.—Column under Colonel Orton went out for combined action against Soulat with Kawam’s and Sirdar Ehtesham’s men. That night our force was attacked. The following morning, attacking enemy, we drove them off. Betreating enemy was then followed up by allied Kashgais. Soulat with his following has gone in direction of Eiruzabad. It is hoped this place will fall into hands of our allies soon. July 8th .—Column returned. Casualties, 3 killed and 17 wounded British casualties, nil. A Kasid arrived with news of revolt of South Persia Bifles at Abadeh and investment of our force of 16th Bajputs. Captain Griffith has been reported died of wounds: wounded, Captain Winter. A few Persian officers and men of South Persia Bifles remained loyal. Bemainder, however, joined Mahomet Ali Khan, Kashgai, who is reported dead from cholera. Our troops are said to be holding out well. July JWA.—Column of Indian troops with small number of South Persia Bifles Cavalry under Colonel Williams, Commandant of Ears Brigade of South Persia Bifles, for relief of Abadeh left to-day. Only one post in town is now occupied by troops who, at request of Governor-General, are being withdrawn, to-day,(rewm&gt;£.—Telpgrnnh line is badly damaged to north. Through communi cations not expected for three weeks. Kazerunis have gone home. Kashgais mostly have deserted Soulat and are moving quietly northwards. In recent events Kawam has taken principal part (under Governor- General’s instructions). Allied Kashgais and Kavam’s men have been lent 200 rifles with am munition by Sykes to fight Soulat. Governor-General through me has warned him that the recovery of rifles will be difficult. Although practically no business is being done town is perfectly quiet. To a certain extent supplies are coming in. Cholera is bad, two British officers being down with it. The supply of cholera vaccine has run out.

Night of June 18th telegraph line was cut. The brother of Soulat Ali Khan captured post of Bajgah. Of garrison of 34 South Persia Kifles, one was killed. Negotiations with Ali Khan are being opened by Governor- General through Sirdar Ehtesham whose own brother he- is. Should he come over to us I have promised to pay Ali Khan tomans 200 monthly. Mahomed Ali Khan Kashkuli, is near town and promises help. Some complaints of looting in city by South Persia Kifles were made and one of the posts they occupied has been handed over to Indian troops. Some half the shops are open. No trouble has arisen in town but there is an in sufficiency of flour for bread the enemy having occupied most of the mills. Trouble may be expected unless something can he done. A large supply of wheat and flour which came from Karachi is with me but this I have promised to keep for troops for whom it will last a month. On June 20th, the outpost outside was evacuated and enemy are within a mile or so of the walls. This morning a small column went out and shelled them. The outpost of South Persia Kifles at Zarghun-Ispahan road has been evacuated and garrison are coming to Shiraz it is said. App rently enemy is in force in this valley. A proclamation to tribes is being issued by me to effect that we have no quarrel with them and that there is no objection to their proceeding northwards, but toulat who is a rebel to his country we refuse to have dealings w r ith. The effect of this proclamation is very problematical. Kawam is very uncertain and I Lave assured him if he stays openly on our side “ as far as an officer can bind himself ” that his losses will be made good. The Governor-General’s behaviour is very good. He is doing his utmost but in town difficulties are great, emphasised by cessation of all trade and traffic and want of flour. A few cases of cholera have occurred among troops. Disease is prevalent in town. 384 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 9886, dated the 24th July 1918.) Telegram P., No. C.

Bulk of Kashgais left Soulat between 20th June and 3rd July and joined opposing party consisting of Kawam, Mahomet Ali Khan Kashkuli, and Sardar Ehtesham. Ali Khan, brother of Ehtesham, was won over and Parman Parma made him Illbegi. Parman Parma was afraid to commit him self by appointing Ehtesham Illkhani but the insistence of military head quarters prevailed and on 3rd Parman P’arma consented and on 4th notified official Sanad.An excellent effect was produced by the shooting of three Persian officers and 11 Persian ranks who, after exhaustive enquiry, were convicted as ringleaders in the Kkaneh Zinian mutiny. The Kazerunis, after losses inflicted on 27th June, quarrelled with Kashgais who did not come to their assistance. There was another quarrel over looted crops on'2nd July and two Kashgais were killed. The Kazerunis then began to leave Shiraz valley for home. On 5th July Nasr-i-Divan and last 500 Kazerunis left Dehshaika for Kazerun. This left Soulat with about 1,000 Kashgais, including about 300 camp followers* It was agreed on 6th July that at dawn on 8th July Indian column should drive Soulat’s force from Ghinar Kahdar to beyond Soulat’s main camp at Ak Chashmeh which is two miles north of Gardaneh Sa^avi. Simultaneously Ehtesham and Mahomet Ali Khan would cross Siakh Pass and move towards Darinjun at dawn on the 8th. ‘ . At 6 p. m. on 7th July Indian column under Colonel Orton with one squadron South Persia Kifles cavalry left Shiraz and after some skirmishing in the dark, camped close to Chinar Had bar at 9 p.m. The camp was attacked during the night but the enemy w T ere easily driven off. Enemy opened heavy lire at dawn on the 8th but enemy were driven back wffien column attacked. Soulat’s force dispersed and ffed west and south, Soulat himself escaping into the mountains west of Siakh villages with a small following. Aided by 2 old South Persia Kifles guns and 2 South Persia Pities maxims Ehtesham and Mahomet Ali Khan occupied Siakh villages killing two of Soulat’s men and wounding three others. Orton’s column occupied Ak Chashmeh and Gardaneh Sagavi and subsequently, in the evening of 8th July returned to Shiraz unmolested. Enemy’s casualties estimated 8 killed and 20 wounded. Our casualties w 7 ere 3 Indian ranks killed, 15 wounded, 1 South Persia Pities cavalry killed. On the morning of 9th July information was received by Kasid from Abadeh that Mahomet Ali Khan, Kaskgai, attacked Abadeh on 26th June and was joined by part of South Persia Pities who murdered ail South Persia’ Pities ranks who were considered to be pro-British. Pemainder of South Persia Pities had joined enemy by noon 29th (24 men) who were in the perimeter occupied by British officers and non commissioned officer’s and 3 platoons of Bajputs. The enemy attacked nightly and tried mining and also flooding of ground to weaken mud walls but failed. Pajputs are reported to be fighting well. It is reported Mahomet Ali Khan died of cholera about 1st July and bulk of mutineers dispersed to their homes, and also that the enemy at Abadeh are disheartened. Erazer has supplies up to the end of July. The situation at Shiraz having improved greatly by the defeat and flight of Soulat and pursuit by the new Illkhani, on the morning of 10th July a column left Shiraz for Abadeh. Column consisted of 2 squadrons B. M. B., 300 Baluchis and 1 section mountain artillery, and also 30 South Persia Pities cavalry and 30 infantry under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Williams. It was accompanied by a trustworthy representative of Kawam and a Kashgai Kalantar of the new lilkhani, Ektesham. The intention is to bring back to Shiraz the remnants of the garrison of Abadeh and Dehbid together with ammunition, treasure and the most important of the stores, that road being left in charge of Tufangchi posts temporarily. It is hoped Colonel Williams will be able to get a good deal of extra transport locally from Kawam Arabs.

Clear line. Last night Jones returned here direct from Baku. He was in Baku from 12th to llth July. I will send a subsequent telegram containing his own report and views, but he brought me an interesting memorandum by McDonnell on general situation in Baku and around it. Following is the gist of this :— (1) He emphasises the positive military, political and economic value of Baku and regards it as the Key of Central Asia and the Middle East. (2) On July 13th military position was as follows: Baku army consists of about 10,000 untrained and undisciplined troops, without organisation, no reserves, very short of officers, provisions scanty and ammunition badly distributed though plentiful. Turkish forces, mainly irregulars (strength about 15,000 of which 3,000 to 5,000 regulars), attacking Baku army on line Adji Kabul Sahemachah. (3) Germans reported landing one division at Poti and Batoum with view to preparing an attack on Baku. (It is assumed that until the enemy is in full strength he will make no serious effort to capture the place.) (4) Meanwhile Germans are obtaining all they require in the nature of cotton and oil from Baku. (5) In Baku itself the belief that the Germans will capture the town as soon as they have concentrated sufficient strength, after which they will cross the Caspian, overrun Trans-Caspia and Turkistan and raise Afghanistan against us. (6) The memorandum there proceeds to discuss counter measures open to us. Main points are a British advance towards Tiflis via Tabriz and Julfa and organisation of local tribes such as Georgians and Armenians. He considers that practically all parties, except active Bolsheviks, would be won over by any overt support by us. (7) He emphasises the importance of strongly supporting Czeck Slav movement, which might obtain control of lower Volga and Port Astrakhan. (8) Verbally MacDonnell emphasized the great importance of our main taining 7 at Krasnovodsk a liaison officer to keep in touch with him by means of steamers which still run daily. He said nothing was seen of a small mission to Krasnovodsk which Mesopotamia had been ordered to send. 391 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 9835, dated the 23rd July 1918.)

Clear line. Fart 2.—Main points of Teague Jones’ report are as follows:— (1) On Central Asian Bailway every facility is given to British officers who are travelling on the lailway and there is no hindrance of any kind.;;i j ill il i !! : ! . Hi' I I : :) i !, i II Kakhka complete (2) On the line between Ilransnovodsk appearance of the Bolsheviks is confirmed. (3) At Krasnovodsk all was quiet going and returning. (4) All large steamers on Baku-Kakhka line have been removed to the Volga and small steamers capable of carrying up to 100 passengers are used to maintain the daily service. (5) There is general good feeling towards the British so long as we are in no way identified with any projects for the restoration of monarchy, a hint of which would make it quite impossible for us to make any headway against the enemy and would cause extraordinary revulsion of feeling against us. (6) MaeDonnell’s position at Baku is extremely difficult. He is greatly* (handicapped r) and has only one sick L 1 change ' officer w r ho can give him no help. On tw r o occasions he has been tried for his life by the Bolsheviks yet he still practically controls the situation there and retains great local influence. Teague Jones’ own view is that situation at Baku is very critical and depends on 2 factors :— («) Co-operation with us of the Caspian TTeet. (b) Active intervention by us. (7) The actual commanders of the fleet are nominally Bolsheviks; but the crews, as a whole, are strongly anti-Bolsheviks and could be gained over to our side by the persuasion that we alone can save the country from the alternative of anarchy or enemy rule, and by making them vicelyf independent of the Bolsheviks. + As sent. (8) The Armenians, by openly boasting that they were the special proteges of the British, have much injured our cause in the Caucasus among the Tartars. Inasmuch as large numbers of Tartars were massacred by the Armenians, this gave rise to the pernicious belief that the British had deliberately adopted an anti-Mahometan policy. (9) it is almost certain that the Baku Bolsheviks are in enemy pay and would obstruct as much as possible active British intervention ; but their position is insecure and any active measures by us would be almost certain I i change. to precipitateJ their fate. (10) Enemy propaganda is extremely active and anti-British. Great play is made with stories of our brutal misrule in India, which is reported and commonly believed to be on the brink of mutiny. Enemy agents swarm § word omitted. everywhere and pan-'lUranian and pan- Islamic doctrines everywhere. §ed, whilst the approaching German invasion of India is discussed everywhere both verbally and in the press. (11) Teague Jones, on his return thiough Krasnovodsk, interviewed Colonel Khan Yamutski/who is the Chief of Yamut Turcomans. The latter said that we need be under no misapprehensions but that the Turcomans to a man were pro-Turk, the result of pan-Islamic propaganda, and that they would oppose the enemy’s advance into Trans-Caspia. Though he did not profess ' any personal sympathy with Turks he regarded enemy \ictory as assureu. (12) Bef erring to Kuchik Khan, the Jang all Chief, he emphatically declared he was not an outlaw as presumed by us, but the paid a°ent of the Persian Government whose orders ho was carrying out. Kuchik had sustained no deleat but was actually increasing his activity and influeace and would be let lose against us by the Persian Government at appropriate time. (13) £art 2.—Papers were intercepted recently by MacDonneil showing a dehnite agreement between Chief|| of II 1 Mazanderan and the Austrian Government, ^ i change. providing for the despatch of an Austrian force not less than *,000^ strong to the coast of Mazanderan w hose objective was further penetration into Persia. (14) Teague Jones’ general impression is that the situation is critical and can only be saved by the prompt appearance at Baku of a British force.392 (Received with Army Defartmect memorandum No. 9886, dated the 24th July 1918.)

Williams telegraphs from Abadeh on 22nd that the Darushulis Kashgai tribes are at Simarun east of Yezdikhast under Ayaz Kikha. Soulat sent up Ayaz Kikha to collect Earushulis to aid Soulat-us-Sultaneh’s Kashgais and Sultan Kazem Khan’s mutineers at Abadeh. This scheme was spoilt by the arrival of Williams’ column. Abadeh will probably be occupied bv Ayaz Kikha soon after Williams starts on the 24th to return here.

It seems likely that the regrettable news about Resht received to-day will adversely affect position at Baku. A prompt re-percussion throughout Trans- Caspia and Turkistan would result through any change at Baku to the pre judice of our interests and friends. Please let me know early if any change of policy regarding Baku should be arrived at, as the movements of mission officers might thereby be affected. We can probably find out if the Governor- General has received Resht news and what be thinks of it as be calls on me this evening. The effect of the news may not be good and it is certain soon to be common property. 403 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 10075, dated the 27th July 1918.) Telegram P., No. M.

On night of 24th I had interesting conversation with Governor-General. He had beard nothing of affairs at Resht nor did we enlighten him. 1. When asked about Jangali movement he said when he was Home Minister he urged his colleagues and Shah himself to suppress Jangalis, but there were strong influences at Court supporting them. He thought they were certainly supported by late Government and by certain elements in present Government. His advice was that we should be sufficiently strong at Resht to deal with Jangalis but he feared we had been too late all through. He stated that the only argument which weigh with Persians, as with other people, was sufficient force on the spot. 2. He said that Jangali emissaries had to come to Shahrud some time ago and that their activities and sphere of action were increasing. 3. He thought that at present the Turcomans along northern frontier of this province were well in hand but that much pro-Turkish propaganda was undoubtedly taking place amongst them. 4. He said that no matter what happened, provided we assisted him with money and arms, he was confident of maintaining order in Khorasan. 5. I told him that Germans intended handing over Azerbaijan to the Turks. He said he thought such a thing should unite Persians of all shades of opinion against the Turks and Germans. 405 Telegram P., No. 130, dated the 25th (received 27th) July 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (sent to Ispahan 196, Ahwaz and Baghdad). It seems to me that to accept Zafar’s offer of 5,000 sowars is to incur heavy expense without corresponding advantage without some definite object for which to employ them and this does not seem to exist at present. Zafar could not keep together collection of large force with his resources. Necessity to ensure Governor of Zafar’s loyalty and of the other Khans is fully recog nised by me but a less expensive means can be found, I think, e.g., increase of subsidy. It also seems to me that 5,000 Bakhtiaris with nothing to do would do as much damage to country as a plague of locusts.406 Telegram P., No. 69, dated the 26th (received 27th) July 1918.

I have received following message in a cypher letter from Zafar;— Begins. Should there be any danger of an invasion of Persia by Turkish or German troops, Ashjaa as lllbegi is not to be trusted. If he would be acceptable to you, I should prefer to have Shihab-us-Sultaneh, but it would be necessary before he is appointed that he should give a written undertaking to sever his connec tion with Murtaza Kuli Khan. Sirdars Mohtasham and Jang should stand sureties that he abides by his undertaking. They mean mischief and should they refuse to go bail for him it would be well to let guns accompany me into Chahar Mahal, as I could face any combination of the Khans with them. I am pre pared to carry on with Ashjaa if there is no danger of an invasion. Ends. Zafar does not seem aware of Shihah’s recent pranks. Latter is now protesting continually of his innocence of any complicity in plot of Murtaza Kuli Khan’s. Why he did not at least warn me of what Murtaza Kuli Khan was up to or prevent assembly of brigands at Najafabad, he cannot explain otherwise than by saying, he could not cope with Murtaza Kuli Khan. Shihab, I am inclined to believe, would not have joined personally any attack on us but would have allowed Murtaza Kuli Khan a free hand. He might have rendered me some trifling service afterwards and I think .his assertions of innocence mean this. In reply I am telling Zafar that invasion of Persia need not yet be treated by us as being within range of practical politics. .Addressed to Tehran 212 ; repeated to Baghdad, 55.417 Telegram P., No. 664, dated the 30th (received 31st) July 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Proposal is calculated to bring about split in tribe, result of which would be insecurity of Ahwaz road. It is regarded by me with considerable misgivings. The agreement contemplated is, in effect, an engagement made personally with Zafar, and not in his position as Illkhani, to retain him in office he keeping up a body of so wars to be employed in our interests in return. The jealousy of the other Khans is calculated to be aroused by this. They would combine to eject him from Illkhaniship and Zafar would probably call upon us to give him armed support, which means increasing our military liabilities, before long. Zafar, if any arrangement of this kind is made, must form a party pledged to carry it out. The two who *are now acting with him do not alone, I consider, possess the requisite standing or influence.

Governor-General expressed his opinion that telegraph communication would probably fail and that evacuation would have very bad impression. Until final restoration of order and there is a policy to be pursued he desires me to suggest that protection of northern road should be left without military interference in his hands. As, with evacuation, we apparently have outside Shiraz, no present military liabilities except on Saidabad road, control I suggest should be vested in Governor-General, payments being made through the Consulate. I asked at same interview if the General Staff had any objection to re-establishment of order on Bushire road, Kazerun, etc., being undertaken by Governor-General. Sykes replied that he had no objection and since this does not appear to clash with military plans, I am therefore urging Governor-General to do what he can do to restore order. Principal object would be to reopen the trade route and communications and not to punish persons implicated in late disturbances.

Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Chief of the General Staff, and Minister, Tehran). During the past 3 months I have been striving to get an acknowledgment of the principle that during military operations the General Officer Com manding a Force in the. Field, being responsible for the safety of his troops, should have general political, as well as military, control. Hitherto I have been rigorously excluded from any control over political factors and Gough would not recognise my (? indisputable) right in this matter even when Shiraz was isolated and critical military operations were in progress. On two or three occasions, being convinced that the safety of my troops was dangerously jeopardised, I was compelled to take the initiative and to insist on certain action being taken. Had I not done so, I am convinced that the moral cowardice of FarmanFarma would have had disastrous ( ? effect) at Shiraz and that the subsequent relief of Abadeh would not have been feasible. Even during the crisis Gough did not act as A Political Adviseffi b ut mai ntained his f^BJtifcude) 'which involved a gfififelTli control* on my part, of (ftniai) tliis 1 role of my political dictator to whose political dict*|j*fc my plans must be subordinated. I have always been willing and anxious to (gr.undecypkerable) consult Gough on all political affairs and the carrying out of political measures has been in Gough’s hands to such an extent that .he has advocated military operations and/^measures regarding the South Persia Rifles without consult- • ing me. My military staff is fully occupied with military arrangements and are unwilling to be mixed up in political affairs which in Persia means the intrigues of Persian officials. It is however impossible for military staff officers to draw up schemes for operations wffiieh involve responsibility for the lives of the troops without acquiring as full a measure as possible of intelligence of general politics on which such military plans must be based and on the political situation which throws light on the probable attitude of neighbouring tribes. Policy and politics in Pars are so ephemeral and rapidly changing that the enemies of to-day become the neutrals or friends of to-morrow. A large factor of risk is involved when small bodies of troops are employed in large areas and secrecy and rapidity of movements are necessary. Our military plans have been divulged and partly spoilt on more than one occasion when Farman Farma has been informed of details. The risk and responsibility for military operations lies solely with me and my staff and I consider we require as free a hand as possible rather than having our hands tied. If Consul will keep me informed fully beforehand and consult emicably with me and my staff beforehand as to bearing on military plans, movements and situations, there could be no possible objection to Consul managing rela tions with F'arman Farma, Qawam and others. The only objection is that we are often informed after arrangements are concluded or not informed at all in matters which vitally affect military affairs. The satisfactory arrangements recently made through Farman Farma and Qawam hinged on the appoint ment of Ehtesbam which was forced to a conclusion by me. I find myself unable to decide that a military situation does not exist. It appears to me that the situation is a military one so long as Indian troops are present in South Persia under my command and liable to undertake active military operations at a moment’s notice. Reports and despatches already submitted show that hardly a month passes without some operations in which casualties occur. Minor military operations have to be undertaken at a very short notice, convoys and escorts are attacked, posts are attacked or treacherously surren dered. The anxiety and the responsibilities of military headquarters can never be said to have definite periods of quiescence during which I could be held to be divested of any responsibility for the safety of the troops under my command. Similarly I find it hard to conceive that I be permitted general political control, on and off, in irregular undefined periods of actual operations, or when it may be ruled that the situation be a military one, or that I should hand over the political control to Gough in the undefined interludes.mtmm Military operations or attacks against posts or convoys come as a bolt from the blue Should I be held not responsible for the safety of my troops if an attack or disaster should occur in a period when Gough 'happened to be exercising general political control ? If a column he operating say against the Kashgais and Chehar fiahis, would I exercise general political as well as the military control in that area, with Gough exercising general political control in the rest of Ears ? My contention is that I should have the general political, as well as the military, control, in due course and throughout the period that the forces under my command are liable to be called upon at any moment for active operations (? in) which period I am held responsible for the safety of my troops. (? Neither) I nor Gough is to blame for the situation which has arisen as, until our relative positions and responsibilities be clearly defined, friction has been ii evitable. We have moreover, each been serving more than one master. With a definite settlement friction will cease. There has been no personal rupture and we have met regularly and settled many points. I waited until May last to raise the point of principle when Gough was leaving and a new Consul expected. I have discussed matter with Gough and trust that modus operandi has been arranged. 420 * Telegram P., No. 72, dated the 31st July (received 3rd August) 1918.

That there are two policies is a fact. Policy of General Staff is, I consider, alienating all Persians and Persian sympathy. Should this policy be approved, I beg that my previous offer of resignation be accepted. Result of Governor-General’s manipulations and intrigues was, I venture to urge, to extricate us from the critical military situation which we had reached. Enquiries may be made later into personal attacks on myself, Governor-General and my Mirza.

Hefcrence Consul’s telegram No. 71 to Foreign, No. 134 to Minister. Two South Persia Rifles units on the Saidabad road have been destroyed by the intrigues of Persia and the open hostility of Persian Government, and I have already arranged South Persia Rifles Tufangchis along this road, as a temporary measure, for one or two months. Consul’s proposal that charge of this road he left entirely in hands of Earman Earma and that latter should be paid for same through Consulate, is strongly objected to by me. This scheme emanates from Earman Farma himself whose real motive is to make money, and who is at heart opposed to South Persia Rifles in Ears as now organised and administered because lie cannot embezzle their pay nor make money out of South Persia Rifles patrols. I was not consulted about this proposal which I regard as preposterous and which vitally affects the morale and standing of South Persia Rifles in Ears. The manner in which Consul ignores me, even in questions of military policy, makes my relations with Earman Earma very difficult. Regarding telegraph line, Earman Earma can easily get this cut and interrupted in order to prove his poiut if this be accepted as a valid argument for handing over the road to him, and I know of more than one instance when he has actually done this. Regarding Kazerun road, Earman Earma has always intrigued with Nasr Diwan, Soulat and others for his own ends, quite regardless of the fact that these intrigues have been dangerous and embarrassing to the .British, although profitable to himself. Since Soulat’s defeat Earman Earma, in true Persian style, wishes to make money out of Ehtesham and others of our allies, out of Soulat’s late partisans and also out of Shiraz merchants. Consul was informed by me that I would raise no objection to Earman Earma mani pulating his intrigues on the Kazerun road in order to satisfy merchants, but it was to be stipulated that we retained a free hand to carry out any military operations along that road in the near future. 425 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 10639, dated the 8th August 1918.) Telegram P., No. 179—)9v-G., dated the 30th July (received 2nd August) 1918. From— Sir Percy Sykes, Shiraz, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla (repeated Prodrome). In Ears there have been two policies, one the policy of Earman Earma, whose main principle has been to make money in every possible way. He runs with the hare and hunts with the hounds, and is the most astute intriguer in Persia. This in a Persian grandee is perfectly natural, and no blame can be attached to him for looking after his own safety, his own pocket and his own interests. But to the military forces in Ears (undue ?) and uncon trolled Earman Earma policy is and had been a source of danger. My staff and I regard as a dangerous and corrupt man the Consul’s chief adviser who is his Munshi Bashi. That the Munshi Bashi is in the pay of Earman Earma and of the Kawam ue have no doubt whatever, and in Shiraz it is a commonly accepted opinion that he was also in the pay of the Soulat. (In Earman Earma Consul, Kawam, has a blind surgeon, and any the other Persians are seldom seen in private by either the Munshi Bashi or him.) The other policy is that of military headquarters. The many good points of Earman Earma are recognised by ns, and we realise that during the stress of the past 18 months no other Persian Governor-General in Ears would have done so well lor us. But Earman Earma’s selfishness and advice is realized by ns and we consider that it is primarily for the furtheiance of British rnteresis that British blood and treasure are to be spent in Ears. And so to further the safety and welfare of the Indian and South Persia Rifles troops, who are the4 instrument of British policy, Farman Farma must be influenced and induced % to act as far as possible, and within reasonable limits. The lurtherance of Persian Government objects, especially when these are hostile towards the British and South Persia Rifles, and the safety of our troops is endangered, to be kept tactfully in the background. For example the chief democrat Shiraz agent of Mukharn Chr Saltaneh (Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh ?) and Faqr- us-Salt, our most bitter enemies, is Baha-es-Sultan. After the first fight against Soulat at the end of May, military headquarters demanded his arrest. Farman Farma feared powerful influences at Tehran. It was arranged by the Consul with Farman Farma that Baha should merely leave Shiraz. When the military crisis was at its height, we discovered, on June 14th, that Baha was back again in Shiraz. Documents have been seized from Baba’s house by us proving that this step was allowed by Farman Farma to oblige the hostile* British * lchailge ' party at Tehran, and our enemy Faqr. Further that in a telegram to Faqr, Baha commended Farman Farma for this step, and stated that Faqr’s properties and interests in Fars were being protect ed by Farman Farma. The Consul admitted, on being questioned, that the fact of the return of Balia had been communicated to him by Farman Farma, but we were not so informed. The return of Baha was considered by the Consul to be of no importance having been so assured by Farman Farma. We hold documentary proof that the ringleader in Shiraz 16th to 19th of the anti-British ao-itation was Baha. This agitation was extremely dangerous and compelled military occupation of the city. To July 27th Baha was found to be agitating again and so he was arrested and he will be deported to India. Similarly when the arrest at Baha of anti-British persons is made the Consul presses us to leave Farman Farma to deal with them. Money is squeezed out of them by Farman Farma, and credit is gained by him for releasing them from the clutches of the British. A share of the spoil is obtained by the Munshi Bashi who is rapidly necoming a rich man. Combines to corner grain were formed by Farman Farma, Munshi Bashi and one or two merchants and prices are raised by Farman FFmna. They unload to the town and British and t-heu the large profits are divided. I consider in the interests of the State that the immediate dismissal of the Consular Munshi Bashi is demanded gs a result of the Consul constituting himself the partisan of Farman Farma on steps which became necessary lor military efficiency and safety and the threatening of Persian nobles by F'arman Flarma and Munshi Bashi against having any relations with me. &lt; 426 Translation of a telegram from the Persian Foreign Minister to the Persian Consul-General in India, dated the 13th Shawal 1336, corresponding to 22nd July 1918. Since last spring notwithstanding the fact that no troops of the Ottomans or their allies were in Persia the British Government determined to send troops into Persia. The presence of British troops in different parts of Persia attracted Ottoman troops into Azarbaijan. Although the Persian Government protested officially, the direct steps taken gradually by the English military, particularly in Fars, were strengthened, and they attacked the Darashuri Kashgai tribe during the month of Shaban (May-June). The Kashgais were alarmed and having united with the other tribes of Fars they demon strated their disobedience to the non-recoguised police force in the south. At that time representations were made to, the British Legation that trouble should be averted by returning the property plundered from the Darashuri tribe and payment of compensation for their men who were killed; but no attention was paid to those representations. In the meantime the tribes gathered their forces and fought their way to the neighbourhood of Shiraz. Telegraphic instructions were sent by the Persian Government to the Governor-General of Fars, the Kawam-ul-Mulk and the Saulat-ud-Daula to suppress the rising. The Saulat-ud-Daula replied that the oppression of the ponce in the south who did not spare the property, lives or honour of the women of the people was unbearable; and that if the object was torestore order, the tribes themselves were willing to undertake it. Repre sentations were again made to the British Legation that the best way to remove trouble was to dissolve the police in the south, as its existence had no other result than that of disturbing the minds of the people; and that if the object was to secure the safety of the trade routes, the Persian Government could do it better themselves. But again the British Government did not favour the idea, and difficulties were increased in consequence. From the beginning of the Ramazan (13th June 1918) the telegraph wire to Shiraz was cut and no direct replies were forthcoming. A number of the English force is besieged and telegrams of the Persian Government have had no result. The Governor of Ispahan has deputed agents to release them. It appears that the Ulema of Ears have recently declared Jehad against alien troops, and the Ulema of Ispahan are also being persuaded to follow suit. Should this happen, it is evident that it would have grave consequences, the effect of which among Muslims in general would be serious. The Government of India in particular must not allow such events to take place by political blunders of their officials. The Persian Government have always tried their best to perfect their friendship and to strengthen their friendly relations and are on this occasion also using their best endeavours but steps are being taken by the British Government contrary to the integrity and neutrality of Persia which they have themselves recognised, and this is making the position of the Persian Government more difficult. It is most important to both sides to avoid such difficulties, and the only way to remove them is to withdraw all military forces from Persia. As soon as the British Government assists the Persian Government in this matter by vacating Persia and removing all their troops from Persian territory, the steps of the Persian Government with regard to the removal of Ottoman troops from Persian territory will have effect, and the Ottoman troops are sure to depart. The Persian Government expects the British Government to take these steps, to dissolve the Police in the south and to give pecuniary assistance to the Persian Government. It is hoped that the Indian Government will support the views of the Persian Government which are in the interests of both parties. The Persian Foreign Ministry is ready sincerely to settle the different questions and to remove difficulties, ami if similarly sincere steps are taken by the other side also, it is hoped that the cause of anxiety for both parties will be removed quickly. Please mention this point also that the Persian Government were unable to recognise the appointment of Sir Percy Sykes, as it was contrary to the rules of the L ouada.- tions of the Persian Empire. 428 Memo., No. 33-C., dated Bandar Abbas, the 24th June 1918 (Confidential), From—The Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bandar Abbas, To—The Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, I enclose a copy of a Jehad notice issued by the notorious Saved Abdul Hussein of Lar. Copies of this notice have been circulated in the Lar and Jahrum districts and some have reached Bandar Abbas through the Persian Post. I am informed that Mohammad Jaffer Khan, Muqtadir-ul-Mamalik, has taken an active part in distributing the notices in the interior. A copy of this Memorandum is being sent to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. Enclosure. “ Help comes from God and victory is near “ If you help God, He will help you”. ‘‘It is our duty to help the devout”. “Kill the Atheists wherever you find them by arresting them, surrounding them and ambushing them ”. O* the devout, 0* brethren in faith l Are you asleep or awake and watchful ?You must have heard the outcry of the inhahitants of Shiraz against the violation of the honour of Muhammadans, and their imploration for help from every district and every person to wage a holy war and put an end to the mischief of these infidels. Sardar Ashair and all the Khans of Dashti and Tangistan have com menced a war on the infidels of Shiraz and their helpers, and they are being aided by every place and every person. They will, God willing, inflict good punishment on them and send them to hell. Therefore in accordance with my religious duty, I notify ail the people, especially the inhabitants of Bandar Abbas, Tarum, Sab’ah, Kuhistan, Bikhehjat and Gerash and all the Muhammadans generally, that they should know their duties and should give the infidels no time to escape and wreak vengeance on them, contrary to the past. Should any one fail to join this Jehad and to put an end to the mischief, he has committed an unlawful act, is an apostate from Islam, will be deprived of the intercession of the Prophet on his behalf for mercy and will be an associate of non-believers. “ A messeger should only communicate his message.” (without date or signature.)UH WSmSOKBftKKBSSS.

Clear the line. I telegraphed on receipt of your telegram of the 6th July to Captain Peel, Vice-Consul, who was then in the Kuhgelu country north of Behbehan with Sardar Zafar. I asked him to discuss the relief of Abadeh with Sardar Zafar, adding that his expenses up to any reasonable limit mio’ht he guaranteed and that the Commander-in-Chief had agreed to his taking the°two mountain guns now with him. I suggested that a Bakhtian advance on Kazerun or Shiraz was possibly more practicable than on Abadeh and with the Minister’s concurrence I instructed Peel to discuss this also with Following is Peel’s reply Begins. “ We have come to the conclusion that any attempt to relieve Abadeh from this side is doomed to failure. Hence Zafar has wired to Amir Mujahid and his own sons in Chahar Mahal through Consul-General, Ispahan, to start with one thousand picked cavalry for the relief of Abadeh at once. There is every prospect of success if the garrison can hold out for another fortnight. Terms of telegram are also calculated to have a restraining effect on Murtaza Kuli and his gang. “ Hlkhani and Illbegi, who leave for the north in a few days, ask me to assure Consul-General, Ispahan, that they are ready to render any assistance he may require. A11 the reward they look for is that we will extend to them preferential treatment in future over such of their brothers as are now hostile to us. Zafar is also prepared to raise at once and place at our disposal 5,000 good cavalry for service against Kashgais or elsewhere. I strongly urge serious consideration of this offer. The outstanding point is that Za ar, s *! a and Eateh are with us to the last man and have tribes at their backs. VVe could very soon restore order in Central and Southern Persia with sue a force and fill gap caused by collapse of South Persia Rifles. P 'Q2 ** The Khans leave for the north in a few days and very early orders era his point are solicited.** Ends.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorasan, Meshed, through Robat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Governor-General’s sudden dismissal is always possible. I agree monthly subsidy is best especially as he requires the money for monthly expenses of troops. I suggest the following definite conditions, some of which he is already loyally observing :— (1) Arrest of all enemy agents and propagandists in Khorasan, and their delivery to us. (2) Delivery of escaped prisoners of war to us or their satisfactory intern ment in Meshed as Governor-General may prefer, regard being had to his position with Tehran Government. (3) Interception and delivery to us of enemy correspondence as far as possible. (4) Sever treatment of all who raise false charges or reports against us. (5) Appointment of his Governors in consultation with me. (6) Assistance to military mission to Trans-Caspia by allowing us exclusive use of telegraph line to a certain frontier post daily for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. Malleson who has interviewed Governor-General with me and has observed his attitude, heartily concurs in the proposal to help him with a thousand rifles provided that they are not of a very new pattern and that ammunition supplied with them does not exceed 50 rounds per rifle. These arms and ammunition might only be given on condition that they be collected and returned to us in the event of Kawam’s recall. I will adress you later regarding organisation and duties of troops to be armed. General Officer Commanding, Cordon, is requested to telegraph his veivvs on arms proposal.

I thought you received all important news from Tehran.p Samsam-es-Sultaneh is now again Prime Minister. He never came here as Governor-General. When his father was appointed Governor-General, Mnrtaz^ Quli Khan left Tehran for Ispahan but Shihab-us-Sultaneh was appointed Deputy- 4' Governor. When Samsam withdrew Sirdar Mohtasham was appointed Governor- General but he too has now accepted post in Cabinet, and Amir-i-Mufakham is now on his way from Tehran to Ispahan as Governor-General. He has given the Minister assurances of friendship, believed by the latter to be sincere. But he will need watching as he has been the most persistently hostile to us of all the Khans. Shihab-us-Sultaneh, whom I have found very unsatisfactory, is still Deputy Governor-General, but says he will not work under Amir Mufakham. He professes friendship but secretly works with Murtaza Quli Khan who has been here for some months past and though now fairly cowed, has been giving me much trouble I hope to be rid of him shortly. Bibi Mariam has also been here for some months. She was troublesome at first but is now quiet like Murtaza Quli Khan. Shihab has done nothing to restore order and has chiefly distinguished himself during his tenure of office by most shameless rapacity. Of the manner in which Akbar Mirza and Mufakham-ul-Mulk assist me I cannot speak too highly.

According to reports from Acting Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, Bakhtiari oper ations against Kuhgelu have been complete success, while Illkhani and Illbegi who are very well disposed have tribe well in hand and can count upon support of Sirdar Jang and Sirdar Assad in Tehran. Amir Mufakham who is also friendly should reach Ispahan shortly and put end to Murtaza Kuli Khan activities.

The Consul was asked for information with a view t© the impressment of all transport in case of eventualities if such action was necessary. To-day the Consul informs me that he has just received reliable news that Kawam is loyal and that the report of the intended evacuation is ground less, but that Boulat is holding garden 2 miles north and north-west of Shiraz. This has been wired to Poreign, Simla, by him. On 12th July, Harvey Kelly reached Gakun half way to Saidabad.

This is so far to the good if, as we had good reason to&gt; believe, the Turkistan Bolsheviks contemplated ceding a free road to the Turco-Germans through Trans-Caspia, but, as the railway men have little discipline or organisation and no desire to return to work on former lines, it does not by any means exhaust our difficulties in that region. Their disposition to oppose enemy is also so far an unknown quantity, as is also extent to which native races may co-operate with them. The present situation, as I suppose it to be, appears to accentuate necessity for the appearance of our detachment near the Russian Frontier where I suggest the presence of our mission is also particularly desirable until such time as a staple government may invite it to proceed Turkistan itself. I consider that in the meantime much valuable propaganda work could be accomplished. We may hear that the “ Turkistan Union ” has been at work, in which case our problem would be simplified, and it is very possible that Trans-Caspia’s example will have been followed at Tash- kend, Samarcand and Bokhara. We must not disregard the possibility of the Turco-Germans making capital out of the new situation. As time is all important, I am sending this wire pending Malleson’s arrival subject to his remarks hereafter. Representative wishes to leave at latest on July 18th. He is very anxious to receive reply from London, if possible, before he leaves. 362 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 9683, dated the 19th July 1918.) Telegram P., No. M.

First of daily news Summaries ordered from the date of my arrival in Meshed as follows:— News from different sources seems to make it quite certain that the Bolsheviks at Askabad and Kizil Arvat have been completely defeated by the railwaymen and have all Red east. Teague Jones in telegrams from Krasnovodsk,. dated 15th July, received to-day confirms this. Another informant who is in close telegraphic communication with stations on the Central Asian Railway states that strong anti-Bolshevik sentiments are prevalent and that all classes (including Turcomans) are voluntarily joining forces notwithstanding half * „. ,. . . of ( * ) Bolsheviks throughout Turkistan and Trans-Caspia.

I had final interview with representative of “Turkistan Union” “ this morning and paid over to him 1,800,000 roubles, which, together witR^200,000 paid yesterday, complete the two millions asked for. We held fresh discussions over(the whole field and I enumerated the following principal points • (I) An endeavour was made by representative to involve me in further promises for the future and he alluded to pledges which it was alleged Pike had made in Caucasus. I replied that I would be perfectly frank with him ; that British Government had unfortunate experience of pouring money into Bussia without result; that I had undertaken considerable responsibility in recommending my Government at very short notice to support his party concerning which we knew little, and that I must have tangible evidence of progress made before I could recommend further support. When his party had satisfied me that they were able to make good I would do my best with, the Government to secure them such farther support as seemed desirable. He admitted in reply the reasonableness of this attitude. (A I gave him the following points, to all of which he agreed, as the result of a question from him concerning the direction in which they could best serve us, if they were successful. (b) He should be prepared, if necessary, to block the harbour of Krasnovodsk and destroy the railway, we should assist him with explosives. It is essential to keep the enemy out of Trans-Caspia. (4) It was essential that Union should avoid any movement of troops likely to be considered by Afghanistan as provocative in character, having in view nervous and generally unsettled conditions in Afghanistan. (5) Machinations of enemy agents,* who at present passed to and from without hindrance, were the cause of much the greater portion of the unrest in Afghanistanf and Bokhara. I regarded it in our joint interests that this traffic should be stopped. He promised^ to make special efforts to this end. required should be done with captured enemy knew of one recognised treatment for spies after papers had been secured and information extracted. (7) I said that enemy prisoners of war who were a great element of danger should be rounded up and disarmed. He said that this was one of their first objects and asked if we would subsequently take charge of them. I replied that distances rendered this impossible, and suggested close confinemQnt in remote regions of Semirechia. He reckoned the total number of prisoners to be 30,00O, who excluding 10,000§ Germans, are not dangerous but even friendly. (8) He agreed to my contention that early control of their wireless stations now largely in pro-German hands was essential. (9) He said that powerful enemy wireless station exists in Chinese territory in neighbourhood of Kuidjar, and that it was most desirable that this should be destroyed. I suggest that Kashgar be informed. (? 10||) He was very desirous that they should be joined by a British representative as soon as things began to go favourably, and that I myself should go to Tashkent if and when they had made good there; this, he said, would be visible evidence of support of British Government, I promised that when matters were further matured I would consider these points sympathetically. (II) He pointed out their isolation from communication with the outside world and said it was essential that we should keep them informed of events in Russia, Baku, &amp;c., I promised as far as possible. (12) I stipulat(ed^[) that British signallers be given access to Russian telegraph offices such as Askabad so that TT Omitted. speedy and accurate transmission of my telegrams might be facilitated. I could arrange here for exclusive use of Persian line Irom Askabad to Meshed for some hours daily, so that news * 2 changes, f 1 change. $ 1 change. (6) He asked what we emissaries. I replied that I § 1 change. of■^-ry ■ «„r.»r, lT m,—r mri . mmmm 12 developments in Russian territory would be promptly transmitted to me. Should I move later on to Tashkent, I could remain in contact with British Government to our mutual advantage. He cordially agreed. Note .—You should note the possibility of my requiring, say, two additional expert signallers. (13) Finally I broached the subject of large supplies of cotton now lying in Russian territory and said that whilst we have no particular need for it ourselves, it is vitally important in common interest of allies that its acquisition by the enemy should be prevented. I suggested that the Union should keep this cotton under their control until I prepared a further proposal, He agreed and made a special uote of this. Representative said he felt convinced that his party on receiving his report would work entirely in our joint interests and would do everything possible to meet my views iu every respect. He thanked me cordially for complete frankness with which I had treated him. He expressed the hope that we should assist in the reorganisation of Turkistan and Trans-Caspia anti suggested that I should bring with me to Tashkent an expert financier to control their expenditure of any further sums we might advance them. He leaves on July 19th for Tashkent. X suggest that Mesopotamia should be acquainted by wire under your orders, with necessary extracts from this telegram. 365 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 9817, dated the 23rd July 1918.)

It is essential to destroy electric power station from which the oil-fields receive their power, and of the pipe line from tlm oil-fields to the storage tanks and the pumping stations.

From—The General Officer Conmanding, Force “ D”, Baghdad, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla (repeated to the Secretary, War Office, London). Your 52194 and 52238, July 4th. Neither you nor War Office seem to realise the difficulties of keeping a force in Persia fed and equipped. Eirstly. Kegarding supplies. I have sent up my Director of Local Kesources to verify the estimate as to supplies made by Dunsteryille and Capper and to make a definite report as to supply situation in Persia; on receipt of his report I will advise you further, but in my opinion, it is impro bable that a larger force than that now either in Persia or under orders to proceed there, can be maintained in that country. In winter, the road will not be practicable, except for light traffic, for at least 5 months. A reserve of supplies obtainable locally must therefore be accumulated and such items as are not procurable in Persia must be sent from here. Secondly, Regarding petrol. ( ?* ) may possibly be able to send us supplies of petrol from Baku, but it will * Omission. ^ sa f e ^o rely on this source; the only alternative is for petrol to be sent from here ; this will take up a large number of lorries which will be immobile when wet weather comes. thirdly. Regarding clothing and equipment generally. With the mechanical transport now at my disposal I could supply the force in Persia and create a reserve as for supplies, but this will leave me no mechanical transport to spare and will take away some on which I had reckoned for harvest. Fourthly. Regarding medical arrangements. It will be probable that during winter, owing to climatic conditions, evacuation of sick and wounded will be delayed for considerable periods. I propose, therefore, to increase medical units now with Dunsterville by sending to Hamadan from Amarah a British General Hospital of 520 beds and in addition to place at disposal of Dunsterforce half a casualty clearing station. A 5 months’ reserve of medical stores for all medical units will be stored at Hamadan. Finally, I must point out that the requirements in mechanical transport for troops in Persia will be so extensive that any advance on Tigris or Euphrates fronts beyond railhead will be out of the question, while toe 3rd Army Corps will have only the mechanical transport now used lor its main tenance. It appears unlikely that the 10 additional Ford Van Companies promised me will be available before the end of the year. 261 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 9185, dated the 10th July 1918.)

With reference to your telegram 51790, July 3rd. On June 8th Stokes and Bicharakov’s representative met Kuchik Khan and 3 other Jangali leaders 3 miles west of llesht. Jangalis were ready to let Russians pass but not our troops. They were told British and Russians could not be treated separately as they were allies. Several questions were formu lated by the {e. g., must they evacuate Resht and Euzeli) which takes wire to Dunsterville.Replies were duly sent to Jangalis accompanied by ultimatum from Bicharakov demanding definite reply. Jangalis asked for extension of time which was refused as they were obviously wasting time. Right at Menjil then occurred after which a further ultimatum was sent by Bicharakov demanding free passage and surrender of Turks and Germans in Jangali employment. They returned an evasive answer, and General Dunsterville then took action against them. Stokes was told by Jangalis that Noel had escaped, but this was not true. They flatly refused to hand over Resht Consular Munshi who is their prisoner. They were quite polite but obstinately anti-English of whom they receive distorted and false accounts from enemy agents of the Sinjnbis. Incidentally, the progress of the war in Erance and the case of Suliman lirza are probable cause of this anti-British feeling. 262 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 9131, dated the 9th July 1918.)

Reference your telegram, No 48718, dated 22nd June, re Caucasus Military Agent’s telegram No. 76, dated 20th June. I was visited secretly last night by 1'junkovski, Representative of Turkis an Union ”, who had seen Pike Macdonnel and visited Tashkend. He is m possession of all details communicated by Pike and I have no doubt of his genuineness. The following is his statement of the position at Orenburg 12 days ago. The town is in the hands of the Bolsheviks but the whole Cossack population has risen against them. The railway has been destroyed for 120 versts to the north and 69 versts to the south of Orenburg as far as Iletsk. Butov’s troops are near Chelkar having advanced there from Turgai (last month ? *) they * CbaD s e - destroyed two Bolshevik detachments from Tashkend capturing guns and machine guns. The Bolsheviks wished to send reinforcements, but they refused to go. Of about 1,500 men, whom the Bolsheviks have in Tashkend 900 are Hungarian prisoners. He estimates the number of prisoners in Turkistan at 20,000 (7,000 Hungarian, 3 000 German, the remainder are Poles, who are neutral and Slavs who sympa thise with the “Turkistan Union”). His opinion is that the prisoners are the greatest danger. The Union relies on some 10,000 sympathisers in Turkistan consisting of “ Erontovki ” railwaymen, officers, cadets ana some of the Red Guard. ^Guard and railwaymen are armed and arms and ammunition are hidden near Perovsk and Tashkend. It is expected that a simultaneous rising will take place in two to three weeks as the native population is expected to side with the party which promises a stable government and unpopularity of the Bolsheviks renders the moment favourable. Part II. The Armenians who will be taken into confidence at the last moment will be promised that their interests and security will be secured objects are— To reinstate Governor-General and status quo obtaining up to October last, To restore order. To guarantee Turkistan against Turco-German advance. They ask from us— (1) Earnest of our normal support by the despatch to a point in Persia near Russo-Persian frontier of a detachment of 200 to 400 men. (a) Pecuniary assistance. They hope for 2 million roubles here and 20 million from Tehran, but the sooner the better. They have had 20,000 roubles from Pike and 20u,000 at Baku, of which 1 lakh was expended there,Representative will remain here for 3 days. Earliest possible telegraphic reply is requested. 1 The recent outbreak at Askabad had no connection with this movement. Concerning the question of troops, Consul-General deprecates in the circumstances the reduction of the Meshed garrison below 4-00, but infantry on the way to Meshed might be hastened.

On the night of July 7th, Jarvis returned. The conclusion of his observations is that the majority of the Bolshevik commissioners at Askabad are in Turco-German p^y* stud are dependent on bodvguard of enemy prisoners for their safety. Their plan is to evacuate Trans- Caspia as far as Charjui Bridge and leave the road to Afghanistan open to the enemy, who would probably be on the Afghan frontier within a month of the fall of Baku. The provocative attitude of the Bolshevik commissioners to the population is probably part of the German plan to make their own coming welcome. Nothing was heard there by him regarding the plans of “ Turkistan Union ”, hut it is considered that such movement is the only chance of saving that region from the enemy, and that our assistance, as indicated in my telegram No. M. D.-162 of July 6th is indispensable to bring in those who waver, and also to show that the movement is more than a monarchist plot. Armenians are being ordered to concentrate at Askabad within 3 weeks, hut it is impossible to say whether this has any connection with the move ment. At the same time, all I have heard goes to show that great reliance is placed on us by them. As a whole, the Turcomans will not raise a finger to save the Bolshevicks. The opinion of all classes, generally, is that we are too late to c( ^ te J German plans, and therefore time is all important. It had been hoped tiiat Turkistan Bolsheviks might organise against the Turco-German, but tneie seems to be no chance of this, however.270 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 9182, dated the 10th July 1918.)

Would greatly assist if I could be informed as soon as possible of general military policy decided on with reference to situation in Pars. It is presumed that before troops are sent* Bushire hinterland some proclamation will be made to tribesmen and that I shall be given political powers in dealings with them. The terms of the proclamation will need careful consideration and will be dependent on the general policy to be adopted. Up to the present I have had no opportunity of ascertaining Deputy Political Resident’s views on this subject as he has been (absent*) from Bushire since 17tb May. 274 Telegram P., No. 922, dated the 11th (received 12th) July 1918. From—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Orders with regard to proclamation to be issued immediately before forward movement of Bushire force are solicited. Subject in advance is submitted as whole question of treatment of rebel Khans of Borasjun, Ahrarn and Chakutah is involved. It is suggested that proclamation might begin with short announcement of objects of force, namely, co-operation with Governor-General of Ears in restoration of order, and it might make clear that no harm wUl be done to any individual in Tangistan or Dashti except the three Khans provided no resistance is offered and no difficulties made about supplies, &amp;c. There are two alternatives as regards the three : (1) arrest if it is desired that our relations with hinterland should be restored to their former satisfactory basis :^even if this should provoke some hostilities at outset, we should offer them no terms at all, maintaining Persian Government’s proclam ations of outlawry and announcing that they will be handed over to Persian authorities if they surrender voluntarily within a fixed time, but will be tried by courtmartial for murder if caught during fighting. This would be most strong dignified and effective course as regards whole of Persian Gulf littoral. 2. Advance to Daliki could be attained with minimum trouble and delay probably by demanding formal submission of these Khans to Governor, guarantees of payment cf arrears of revenue to his satisfaction, immediate pay ment of customary blood-money for British officers and men killed and wounded by them, and announcement that future arrangements for govern ment of their districts will depend on their full co-operation with Bushire force. Any terms easier than these would I am convinced be generally regarded as an admission of fear and would encourage resistance. I suggest as regards surrender of Wassmuss notification that any one help ing or harbouring subjects of any state at war with the British Government after date of proclamation will be treated by force as an enemy. His surrender would be made easier by notification that such enemy subjects would be treated as prisoners of war, and similar notification would be required regarding British Indian subjects whose surrender would be unconditional. I have drafted this in consultation with General Officer Commanding who concurs and prefers the second alternative on the whole. I am driven somewhat reluctantly to same conclusion in view of unfavour able season of year. Addressed Tehran ; repeated Baghdad.275 Telegram P., No. 277, dated the 12th (received 13th) July 1918.

Please read in my preceding telegram that Soulat’s troops were three miles not seven miles from town. According to further news of the same date, Soulat’s troops were in occupation of Afifabad gardens and the Bardi Masjid situated three miles north-west and north of city, respectively. There had been rioting at the town, which ceased on Indian troops taking over from Kawam. Soulat had cut off running water-supply of town, but there is ample well-water. This seems all quite possible. The information contained in my preceding telegram I regard as reliable. Poliowing was received in a letter, dated Shiraz, June 25th, written by a servant of Kawam ; it may be considered reliable, exaggeration apart. The Khamseh Arab tribes from all quarters have joined Kashgai who are within 500 yards of city walls ; they have destroyed all the flour mills ; there is much hardship as no fire-wood is reaching city ; food is very scarce ; 200 deaths daily from cholera and starvation ; ail the gardens are in the hands of Kashgai; Arabs have attacked city.

Following is report of Fathullah Khan of South Persia Bifles who escap ing from rebels left Abadeh on July 6th and is now in Ispahan. On death of Mahomet Ali Khan, Kashgai, of cholera, his personal followers left Abadeh, and besieging force now consists of about 250 rebel South Persia Bifles under three Persian officers and 300 Kashgais, &amp;c., under Saolat-us-Sultaneh, Saolat-ud-Dowleh's brother. Ammunition of enemy is nearly exhausted, but they are not much dispirited apparently. Garrison is in no immediate danger and enemy unless reinforced may possibly disperse. Up to July 6th our casualties were Captain Gwynne Griffith and twelve Indians killed. Enemy’s seem to be 250 killed in all. Khabaroff is not prepared to send a relief force until arrival here of re inforcement from Tehran. It appears certain from Fathullah Khan’s statement and from all my other information that ^.gendarmerie are at the bottom of all present trouble with South Persia Bifles and that the taking over of this force en bloc instead of first disbanding it was our great mistake. When I was executing 6 deserters here, one said as his eyes were bein 0 * bandaged “ I am not to blame. I was not a gendarme. ” The other five paid nothing being old gendarmes.

Your 52150, July 4tk. It would be possible, on arrival of reinforcements at Saida bad, to move a column of 2 squadrons, 1 section Mountain Artillery, and 2 Companies Infantry via Shahr-i-Babak Herat-i-Khurreh Marvas Bavanah to Dekbid and Abadek. Up to Marvas I am acquainted witk tke country* and at tkis time of tbe year supplies could be obtained for the column at the above-mentioned places,, a reserve of 13 days’ rations for men being carried on camels. The country is hostile and opposition might be expected from Arabs at Herat and possibly' at Bavanat, but it would not be strong enough to prevent tbe passage of the column. The column could not reach Dehbid before August 20th if the second Echelon reaches Saidabad* viz., August 1st, on account of water, the stages are necessarily long and the best during August would make the march very strenuous. I am quite prepared to carry out this march. Paragraph 2. It is questionable, however, whether the extra strain on the troop would be counterbalanced by the few days so gained and once the column got 2 days from Saidahad all touch with them would be lost. It might not even be possible to inform Shiraz of the movement. Paragraph 3. I am of the opinion, in view of the recent reports which tend to show that Qashgais are cooling off, that the better course would be to push the reinforcements through to Shiraz as quickly as possible in order to allow Sykes to send out a relieving column to Dehbid and Abadeh from the troops he now has at Shiraz, who know the road and conditions from Shiraz to Abadeh. In this case if the M. T. section arrives in time, they could be pushed on with the reinforcements and used with advantage by Sykes, as the road from Shiraz to Abadeh is good for motor traffic, either for rapid transport, or small advance column with guns, or for supplies to mounted troops. Paragraph 4. I consider, therefore, the second course more advisable unless the situation at the time demands a forced march across countrv for the relief of Abadeh. Paragraph 5. I would be glad to know in this connection, whether Sykes m asking foi reinfoicements indicated that on theii’ arrival at Shiraz he would be in a position to undertake offensive operations outside the close vicinity of that place.

We have despatched a messenger from Kumisheh to verify this inform ation.

Agreement was arrived at, principal points being the following (1) Sirdar Ehtesham to be Illkhani, though Governor-General will not give him actual Sanad until he can hear from Tehran. (2) Governor-General to appoint Ali Khan, Salar-i-Hashmat, to be Illbegi.&lt;*•' • 16 Both have signed documents accepting responsibility for security of roads and maintenance of order among Kashgais. Kawam agrees to act as adviser to both and to use his influence with us. (3) No interference with internal politics of tribe on the part of the British. We are to refer complaints regarding robberies or disturbances to Governor-General who will endeavour to settle cases through Illkhani, and in the event of latter’s failure to give redress Governor-General may call upon garrison at Shiraz—as a last resource—to take necessary action. Kawam has signed documents assuring them he will use his best endeavours with us to respect agreement. Sykes approves and Governor- General and Kawam informed accordingly. We are urging Governor-General to give Sanad of Illkhaniship to Sirdar Ehtesham so as to strengthen his hand, I trust Persian Government will definitely sanction appointment and earliest intimation sent here. Plans are being made in informal discussion for Ali Khan to attack Soulat, Mahomet Ali Khan to attack Kazerun, for telegraph line north to be repaired and for action against Mahomet Ali Khan, Kashgai, cousin of Soulat, and Governor of Abadeh who is threatening that place. If matters continue to progress satisfactorily investment of Shiraz should be concluded very soon, though Kazerunis still round town and water-supply still cut. Greatest credit is due primarily to Governor-General who has kept Kawam straight and also to the Kawam who has carried through negotiations very successfully. Incidentally he has strengthened his own position enor mously which is to our advantage. Later. Sirdar Ehtesham was promised this morning in my presence by Governor-General that he would give him Sanad of Illkhaniship to-morrow.

Matter is being discussed with Poreign here, and will be settled in good time before the troops are despatched. 305 {Confidential.') A statement of South Persia Rifles policy for Southern Persia* Shiraz, 13th April 1918. In view of the departure of His MajesVs Consul, it seems desirable to restate briefly the broad lines of South Persia Rifles policy for Southern Persia. 2. The most important question is the development of the lines of communication between Bandar Abbas and Shiraz and between Bandar Abbas and Kerman, in which connexion the Kerman Area is now relatively safe and tranquil. This task includes the development of the port of Bandar Abbas, the construction of the difficult section of road between the sea and the plateau, the erection of forts at strategical points, and military action by which the tribes are forced to forego raiding. The Kawannul-Mulk, the hereditary chief of the Khanseh Arabs, has worked satisfactorily in this direction. Supported by funds, munitions, and a force of South Persia Rifles, he has.wiraNMMHMM ■Mk. regained control over the Baharlus, the most predatory Khanseh tribe. He has also recently punished some of the sections of the Mazidis who attacked a South Persia Hifles caravan near Bandar Abbas on 28th December 1917. The Kawam-ul-Muik realizes that he depends to a considerable extent on our support, but he and his staff are somewhat influenced by the hostile attitude of the Persian Government towards the South Persia Rifles and the British. He also does not really discourage raids by his tribesmen on Persians, as he profits in the settlement of such cases. He has made much money during his recent tour, but will probably continue to plead poverty. Owing to the drought of 1917, the Arab tribes have lost a large percentage of their flocks and transport; they are also very short of cartridges. It is therefore an exceptionally favourable opportunity to deal with the robber elements and the Kawam may be expected to assist in the task, more especially in the case of tribes which refuse to obey his orders. 3. Second in importance to the lines of communication is the protection of Shiraz and its vicinity, together with the development and protection of the main road leading northwards to the boundaries of Pars. The Parman Parma has now been Governor-General for over 18 months and during that period has overcome many difficulties which perhaps he alone, even with strong British support, could have overcome. He generally realises that he is closely identified with the British, but his strong personality, his ignorance or disregard of the European point of view and his fits of timidity and depression tend to make him very difficult to deal with at times. It is, however, essential to humour the Parman Parma up to a certain extent; and the fact that mainly he troubles about details and leaves large questions alone has its advantages. The protection’ of Shiraz requires a considerable force; not so much for its actual defence as for the desirability of keeping its populace and the Parman Parma free from alarm. On this account there are numerous posts of Indian troops and levies round the city. The turbulent Kashgais recognise this fact and rob much less than they otherwise would do. The Ispahan road, which has been opened as a fair ■weather track for wheeled traffic, is also strongly protected. The Swedish system of small posts strung along the road is gradually beinsr superseded by the modern system of strong striking forces at strategical centres with a modified use of towers at certain dangerous places, such as passes, which are held by levies. The Parman Parma tries to insist, on the efficacy of innumerable levy posts, but this policy is not sound, especially at the present period when bands of robbers are frequently one or two hundred strong. Generally speaking, the road is efficiently protected but until^ the predatory tribes are convinced that robbery does not pay, raids are bound to continue. When possible operations are undertaken to punish the raiding tribes. 4. The most difficult question is fortunately the least important. To dwellers in Bushire the opening up and policing of the road to Shiraz looms very large, but it is not really so. It would be but a small convenience for the South Persia Rifles to have an alternative route as it would be difficult and costly to organize a second base at Bushire. At the same time in the general interests of the country and of British prestige, it is desirable finally to control this very hilly and precipitous mule track, which it will never pay to improve into a road for wheeled traffic. The most important tribe which spends the winter in the area concerned, is the Kashgai. its Chief, the Soulat-ud-Dowleh (also called the Sirdar Ashair) is a fairly capable man of about 38. He is disliked in the tribe for his meanness and he is somewhat cowardly, but yet he manages to retain his position, and none of his brothers could oust him without our assistance. The Earman Parma had a personal grudge against the Soulat-ud-Dowleh which did much harm to our interests, but His Highness has now realised that his feelings must be subordinated to British interests—at any rate to some extent.18 The Soulat-ud-Dowleh is at heart adverse to the restoration of law and order, as he gains by fishing in troubled waters. He also gains by his control of the Kazerun road by levying blackmail on caravans. He is believed to intrigue with the “ rebel ” Khans of Dashtistan and Tangistan. On the other hand, he has undoubtedly restrained his tribesmen from raiding on the Ispahan road and is anxious not to break with the British. He has recently been urged from Tehran to create trouble and disorder, but is unlikely to take a decided line in the matter. In short, the Soulat-ud*I)owleh is not a friend of ours, but is afraid to declare himself an enemy. x The problem of the Bushire-Shiraz route is two-fold. There is the problem of the “ rebel ” Khans at the back of Bushire, who refuse to pay revenue to the Governor^General of the Gulf ports and there is the problem of the road. Owing to the extraordinary natural difficulties, the Indian and Persian troops at Shiraz are not strong enough to deal with the whole problem, but would require the co-operation of at least a brigade from Bushire. This fact is accepted by the military authorities in India and, in view of the heavy call on India’s military resources from other and more important areas, it seems unlikely that a brigade will be available for the purpose. Unless Bushire plays its part it would be a grave error to lock up South Persia Rifles or Indian troops at Kazerun, which would be a cyl de sap with very difficult lines of communication. The road is open for trade, the merchants paying certain sums in return for protection. 5. In conclusion the policy by which the Parman Parma, the Soulat-ud* Dowleh and the Kawam-ul-Mulk have been induced to co-operate with the British in the restoration of order, has hitherto been successful and, if continued, will finally solve the problem of security in Southern Persia. Shiraz, ^ P. M Sykes, &gt; Brigadier-General, The 13th April 1918. ) Inspector-General, South Bersia Bijles. Note .—It is to be observed that the above was written just a rm nth before the attack by the Darashuli branch of the Rashgaison the South Persia Rifles fort at Khan-RZinian brought about a change in the Kashgai situation. Copy to Chief of the General Staff, with compliments. * Mg; A Khj fa# I?ote His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. Regarding the attached statement of South Persia Rifles policy for South Persia, I may say that I am in general accord with what has been Written. In view of my probably early departure, it only rests with me to state my conception of what is our general policy in Southern Persia. 17 When I left Tehran in. July 1916, my instuctions were to work in conjunction with the Parman Parma towards keeping Pars as quiet as possible, to use every endeavour to reopen the Bushire road, to maintain tranquility on the main roads and to assist the development of trade. His Highness Parman Parma was selected as Governor-General of Pars, as 'beino* the only person who could probably carry through this policy, and’ to enable him to do it His Highness has been liberally assisted with funds, both in the form of gifts from Hjs Majesty’s Government and as advances recoverable from the Persian Government. At the time of his appointment, the Persian Government were friendly and gave His Highness their support in his policy, but that Cabinet fell after a time, and has been followed by a succession of Cabinets, some not too fripndly and others actually hostile.His Highness with my own actual and moral support has, I consider, followed out the line of policy agreed upon, and has kept Ears which before our arrival could be called actively hostile to British interests, calm and, at least, if not actively friendly to us, passive, at a time when great influence was being brought to bear, especially from Tehran, to create trouble for us here. This passivity is also, of course, very largely due to the presence of British Indian forces here, but that by itself would not be sufficient to maintain tranquility. Without the active co-operation of His Highness it is I conceive more than probable that there would have been, and still -more might easily be in the future, active opposition on the part of the townspeople and tribesmen which would tax all the energies and resources of the forces at our disposal. It has been an axiom with me, that the importance of maintaining our position without overt hostilities between ourselves and the population of Ears, justifies the expenditure of even large sums of money, even at a time when economy is an urgent necessity. His Highness requires our continual support, and as remarked in the ! statement, some humouring, but I consider that, broadly speaking, His Highness : is entirely committed towards us, and he should not be suspected of any anti- 1 British proclivities. His fortune is bound up with our own, and a British defeat would mean that he would have to throw himself on our protection [ entirely, for his own country would on longer be a safe refuge for him. The remaining two local factors are the Soulat and the Kawamjt has been our policy since I have been here to keep the Kawam pronouncedly on our side, in the manner detailed in the statement, and, even in the face of certain discouragement, this policy should be continued. My endeavours have been to make the Kavvam so identified with the British cause, that it will be impossible for him to adopt any other attitude. To this end he should be given a large measure of assistance when required. The Soulat has so far been induced to maintain at least a friendly-neutral attitude towards us, and this is about all we can expect from him. It is known that he has dealings with Wassmuss and enemy agents, but so long as he does not actively assist them, it may be counted to him for righteousness. A friendly attitude, but without monetary assistace, might continue to be maintained towards him, unless he shows by his acts that he is aiding our enemies. I agree with the view expressed as to the Busbire-Shiraz road. ' * Shiraz, ) Goran, Lieutenant-Colonel, May 1918.

Letter received from Shiraz only 6 days old by Shabab-us-Sultaneb, acting Governor of Ispahan, substantially confirms the news. Murtaza Kuli Khan has bad bands of Jafar Kuli Biza Juzdani and Cbiragb Ali assembled at Jafarabad about 20 miles west of Ispahan probably to atfack the town. Shahab-us-Sultaneh tells me, however, that he does not think that they will make attempt in view of the news from the south. I do not think they will either. In any case we are more than sufficiently strong for them. This refers to my immediately proceeding telegram. Addressed to Tehran.307 Telegram P., No. 953, dated the 16th (received 17th) July 1918.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. I am quite conyinced that Officer Commanding, Cossack Division, with whom I am on most cordial terms, will do everything in our interests in his power. But his position is not easy. Virtually he is the chief of Shah’s personal guard, and under .Russian Government’s instructions has to take his orders from Shah or in last resort from B-ussian Minister. Hence it is difficult for him to decline Shah’s orders framed so as to give Cabinet support. He declines to accept orders from Minister of War. He is fullly alive to the possibility of our stopping our advances. Indeed he has used it as argument with Shah to prevent His Majesty trying to use Cossacks to support Cabinet. Hence there is no occasion to use this argument with him. He gives much assistance and information and is loyal co-operator. This refers to your telegrams, No. 374.

Government of India are inclined to agree that it is worth paying for Governor-General’s continued co-operation. They think with Minister, however, that payment by monthly instalments would be preferable to lump sum down. If you agree, what monthly subsidy would you recommend ? What definite conditions, if any, would you suggest should be attached to it ? Government of India would be glad if you would obtain and telegraph the views of General Malleson and Dale as regards proposed arming of force of a thousand men for Governor-General. Chief of the General Staff agrees to their being consulted. At the same time please report details of proposed oiganisation and scope of duties as far as possible. Pending definite orders of Government of India you should, of course, avoid committing yourself to Governor-General.

I was shown a telegram by Governor-General yesterday from Minister of Foreign Affairs saying that we are building barracks and fortifications outside Birjand; that our troops and levies were increasing and that large quantities of munitions are being brought up from India. Governor-General asked what reply he should send. I said I had no accurate or recent information and would make enquiries. Persian Government might rest assured however that any additional military preparations we might make were aimed, not at Persia, but against possible enemy activities in Trans-Caspia. Persia’s interests were involved as well as our own and that there is no road by which troops could reach Trans-Caspia but that via Sistan. With this explanation he was quite satisfied.

Should be grateful if I could be kept informed by telegram of any fresh serious events in Central Persia.

I have the honour to refer to my telegram No, 116, dated the 2Sth ultimo, and addressed to His Majesty’s Minister and the Government of Ipdia in the Foreign Department, reporting the arrdfet by His Excellency the Governor- General, and deportation by ourselves, of one Meshedi Ghulam, a Caucasian Turk of this city who owns a chemist’s shop in close proximity to the caravan serai in which our troops are quartered. 2. This man was deported from Persia by the Russians as a pro-Turk two years ago, and had returned to Meshed and resumed his business some time after the outbreak of the revolution and subsequent disturbances in Russia. About three weeks ago I was informed by one of the officers of the 19th Punjab Infantry that he had made a remark favourable to the Turks to the Subedar-Major of the Regiment, adding an invitation to dine on which occasion the subject of the Turks was to be discussed. The Subedar-Major made a diplomatic reply and reported tne matter to his superiors. 3. I informed the Governor-General who arrested Meshedi Ghulam with commendable promptitude, and handed him over to my colleague who passed him on to us for despatch to India. He left on the following day when a favourable opportunity happened to present itself, and I have since heard of his safe arrival at Kain.4. After his departure I was asked by my colleague to telegraph to the officer in command of our troops at Turbat-i-Haidari a series of questions to be put to the prisoner, and this telegram of mine was crossed by one from the British Agent saying that the Bussian Vice-Consul at Turbat had “ demanded’* the presence of Ghulam at his Consulate in order that he might be interrogated by him regarding the disposal of his business at Meshed and other domestic matters, and asking for instructions. He added significantly that M. de Beauvais^had arrived at Turbat. 5. I replied that the attendance of the prisoner at the Russian Consulate was not necessary as it had already been arranged that the questions should be put to him through the Officer Commanding troops. The latter, however, caused the man to be sent direct to Khaf, avoiding Turbat; and gave as his reason that “ much interest is exhibited on his expected arrival ”. The replies to the questions were taken by the Officer Commanding at Khaf, and have been sent in to me and delivered to my colleague in due course. # 6.

The most essential thing is to strengthen Bicharakov with palpable proof of British support. Four Duncars will embark for Baku about July 1st, and it is proposed to send later a company of l/4th Hants to escort the British Officer with Bicharakov. I must await a more favourable opportunity for going to Baku myself, a thing I am very anxious to do. I have been promised by Bicharakov that this will not be delayed when all parties agree to receive me, and to sink dissension for the common object offering resistance to the “Turks Buds. Reference your telegram of June 28th, No. 61190. The instructions contained therein have been communicated to Dunsterville and will strengthen his hand with Bicharakov. When I know Dunsterville’s latest opinion I will reply, and, in the meantime, I am making every preparation to get the troops ready that he has asked for previously. It is not clear as to whether I can authorise Dunsterville to destroy the oil wells as asked for in my telegram of June 17th, No. X.-9597.

Dunsterville is un able to help, and my inability to relieve Abadeh has been explained to Minister. Garrison here consists of 320 Persian Cossack infantry, 100 cavalry, a few machine guns, two mountain guns without shells and two field guns without horses. Bakhtiaris threatened to disnrm Persian Cossacks recently. Sufficient pre cautions against this have been taken. Attitude of Bakhtiaris, of whom there are many in Ispahan, is doubtful, however, and Russian Officer Commanding, Cossacks, regrets his inability to despatch a relief force. I agree with him that \ would he dangerous to denude Ispahan of Cossacks. Small reinforcement is expected from Tehran in about a fortnight. We may then be able to do something, but even then our force would only be sufficient to co-operate with a force from South. Could not relief be sent from Kerman ?

Bolshevik influence remains near Taahkend and Askabad. Prisoners of war not unsatisfactory though some 13,000 exist near Tashkend and elsewhere. Chief German agent Schmidt is now in Bokhara ; his efforts to export cotton crop have failed, though it is believed Germans have offered 58 million roubles for it. Two years’ store of cotton lies on Central Asian Railway. Turkistan Mission in Caucasus have requested us to send small British or Indian force and 200 men with 6 selected officers has been suggested as moral support. Caucasus Military Agent has expended 20,000 roubles as preliminary expenses for taking over Caspian Pleet. Ends. The above is a separate undertaking entirely from your instructions regarding Baku which still hold good though it may be necessary eventually to transfer to Krasnovodsk any troops you may have to send to Baku. Any troops moved to Baku or Krasuovodsk should in any case be immediately replaced North-West Persia from your main force. Pending further instructions Krasnovodsk will temporarily come under your control, though it is technically in the area allotted to India’s control.

It is therefore anticipated that as they have sufficient ammuni tion and supplies for a month, they can hold out for at least that period. The most direct and quickest method of relieving them is from direction of Ispahan. It is suggested that the utilisation of Cossacks from Tehran and Ispahan is the readiest means, and the immediate consideration of some such step is strongly urged.

Details are obscure, but the presence of 150 Cossacks placed ■at disposal of Cabinet by Shah’s personal order to Russian Officer Commanding was certainly a large factor in suppressing demonstration, in spite of the fact that the manifestants were aware that Cossacks had orders not to use their arms except in self-defence. The Officer Commanding might possibly have declined do furnish this force. Had he done so, however, i believe he would have been forced, like his predecessor, to resign by the agitation of officers under him. Of these the great majority are strongly anti-British, and very illogically believe that agitation supported by us against Cabinet, is really aimed at the 'deposition of the Shah whom it is their special duty to protect. In certain quarters Officer Commanding is accused of deliberately playing Cabinet’s game. Personally I do not believe it, nor do I see how he could have acted otherwise in the peculiar difficulties of his position. Question however arises whether it is worth while our continuing to pay a force that can be used against us and Persian friends have suggested to me that we should threaten Shah to stop payment of his guard-, unless he dismisses present Cabinet in favour of Yossuq. He is quite aware of possibility of this threat and it would probably fall flat. In any case we are hardly in a position to use it yet as it would arouse latent Anglophobia of Russians all over Northern Persia into activity ; ;(? besides) some use could still be made of the force.

When your telegram of 28th June, No. 61196, was received, a senior officer of my Quarter-Master-General’s staff was at Kasvin reporting on the local supply possibilities of Dunsterforce (on which I required first hand information) and, for the purpose of organising the purchase of supplies on a large scale in view of my increased commitments, my Director of Local Resources was sent up immediately. In the meantime, the 39th British Infantry Brigade, which has been earmarked for the purpose, has been ordered to move up into Persia by battalions as transport becomes available. The undermentioned units will follow it:— An 18-pr. Brigade (less 1 Battery already en route). A Field Ambulance. A Field Company R. E. These troops will march by night; tents by day are a necessity* as the maximum shade temperature at present average i£ about 116° and no trees exist. Marching troops will be assisted as much as possible by ambulance wagons. The collection and distribution of the harvest in the Hillah area would normally be spread over a lengthy period, hut I am withdrawing from that area some 200 A. T. carts and am withholding from it one Ford Van Company which has just arrived and was under orders to go there. During summer, Dunsterforce is being supplied by lorries in stages from railhead, and all available lorries, including those belonging to the Artillery are being utilised. I do not think that in the winter any metalling put on the roads now will stand lorry traffic during wet or snow owing to the spongy nature of the soil* and I shall then have to rely only on pack transport wheeled carts and Ford Vans with their corresponding limitations. A month ago the survey of the railway line beyond Khanikin was com- jnenced. Near Kasr-i-Shirin there are considerable difficulties owing to the10 transverse ridges encmintered, and the Takigirra is a steep hiuflp, the snrmnunt- ing of which by a railway is not apparently a war proposition. I have ordered an expert from Basrah to report on the feasibility of a ropeway here which may be of use. ’. Work on the Khanikin-Hamadan road is well in hand. Owin°* to the depopulated state of the country due to Russian occupation (which aiso means a lack of local supplies),, local labour is hard to get. It is being supplemented by military and imported labour. East of Hamadan work is beim? done bv contracts with road firms. ° I have found it difficult to communicate with Dunsterville owino’ to break down on the telegraph line between here and Enzeli and am awaitin'^ his con sidered opinion based on the terms of your telegram under reference. It has been repeatedly asserted by him that east of Hamadan an Artillery Brigade and an Infantry Brigade can live on the country. The primary necessities therefore of maintaining the force I propose to send him resolve themselves into the question of supply en route and subsequently to that of petrol, lubri cating oil, spares and ammunition, clothing, medical requirements, ordnance * 1 change. stores, &amp;c. Of these, the supply of petrol , ,, , , proves* the greatest difficulty. Tnis should be relieved, if, and as long as, we hold Baku. The further wish of His Majesty’s Government to show as much force as possible in North-West Persia is thoroughly realised by me, and my efforts to carry out that policy are limited only by space and the lack of means to over come that space. 246 (Received with Army Department memorandum No 9C65, dated the 8th July 1918.)

Situation in En&amp;eli and Baku is most complex. Besides Bicharakov Force now embark ing, there are 300 Bed Guards at Enzeli. Bolshevik Committee which is anti-British controls the town. They dare not now interfere with me, but it is desirable to avoid open rupture with them. At Baku all classes appear deter mined to defend the place against the Turks. They desire our aid, but Bolsheviks suspect our designs and object to admit any one wearing British uniform. They are willing to accept British money and rifles in exchange for oil and petrol, but are jealous of any attempts to control the Caspian and Baku. Under these circumstances it is quite impossible to establish British control of the Caspian at present. In my opinion the only possibility of our securing a footing in Baku lies in our connection with Bickarakov who, if we deal fairly by him, will do so with us. At the same time his position is extremely difficult owing to his connection with us. For this reason I have not taken over the Bussian wireless at Enzeli because such action would instantly alarm and alienate the Bolsheviks who might compel Bicharakov to cut adrift from us. At suggestion of Bicharakov I limited the detachment of British troops at Enzeli on June 30th to 50 men sent nominally to guard aerodrome. As Bicharakov’s force and Bed Guards evacuate Euzeli, this detachment will be increased until we have effective control at Enzeli.12 I intend to adopt a similar. policy at Baku, but though this policy is gradual, it is most urgently and vitally important that we should have a force ready at Enzeli to seize an opportunity which may be presented at any moment through the downfall of Central Bolshevik Government or any other cause. All hope of controlling the Caspian is lost if Baku falls. The Turks appear to be operating in three directions, viz .;— (1) Against Baku. (2) South of Tabrijs. (3) Against the Jelus. According to my information, it is their intention to take Baku first. To hamper this advance we should place a containing force before Tabriz and concentrate on assisting the Jelus. If the political situation at Tehran makes a display of (British force?*) • i change necessary, I consider that one squadron, one field - battery and 500 rifles would be sumcient to deal with any opposition encountered. If I receive a mountain battery and a complete cavalry regiment, I consider that, with a brigade of field artillery and a brigade of infantry, I shall have sufficient troops,Always provided that they arrive before any radical change in the situation occurs. In view of the lateness of the season the precarious situation at Baku, Urmia* and Shiraz and the possibility of rapid developments in any or all of these places. I cannot too strongly emphasise necessity of expediting the despatch of above force. Ends. ~ r My arrangements for collecting transport are bearing completion. It is my intention to despatch infantry first and I hope to send them half a battalion at a time by motor vehicles, guns and 1st and 2nd line transport to follow by March route. Leading infantry arrives Ruz tomight by train. 8th Battery, RoyM Field Artillery, reached Harunabad and 2 squadrons, 14th H-Ussars, are due at Hamadan to-morrow.

After *—Owing to the absence of a safe means of communi cation it is a long time since I have addressed you. It has also been due to other obstacles one of which was my own indisposition which has, for the last nine months, kept me under the medical treatment and made me give up religious discussions, teaching and prayers. I have been better lately. As regards these parts inspite of all the revolutionary and numerous changes, which took place in these sacred places, there is complete peace and perfect security and everyone is busy looking after his own without interference and all are sure of their safety and of the security of their property, persons and honour. In fact ever since the occupation of Iraq by the British Government population, prosperity and civilization are increasing, and roads and paths are getting easier and safer. The road which a big party could not pass through, without doubt and fear, a single man can now traverse most fearlessly and with perfect certainty. The British officials have been and are still attac mg extraordinary importance to agriculture and aged persons assert that they never, within their memories, seen such great abundance of crops both in ' quality and quantity as this year. Merchants and craftsmen believe that whatever they possess is their own. During the siege of Najat w hic was meant for arresting the wicked and mischievous people, every possible care was taken not to dishonour the sacred tomb and to respect the great Alims and care -was taken that the innocent poor should not be oppressed. Special consideration is paid to the Persian inhabitants and pilgrims of this sacred place. All the holy places, even a place which may be known after the name of some son of an Imam or any other great man or any mosque are receiving full attention and if they require any repair it is made at once. All the ancient buildings and remains which have been ^ tke verge of falling down, have been rebuilt as before or even better. The (English) people have hll along been well known for keeping promises and treaties and for sincerity and faithfulness. My object from dwelling upon this point long, is not merely telling a story or writing a news, which, I believe, is in no way my duty. y o jec is this that with a Government like this which has been so very well known for justice, keeping the promises and sincerity it is most advisable to show fervent friendship. I don’t mean by this that the Persian Government should give up its present attitude of neutrality. What I mean is, that friendship with the British Government and reliance upon its advice must be the first and the foremost object of the Persian Empire, and it should not give ear to wfiat some evil-minded persons, who only take in view their worldly advantages and fulfilment of their selfish desires say. The matter should be given oroug consideration and complete deliberation and honest well-wishing wise men, who have at heart the welfare and prosperity of the religion, nation an e peop e should be taken into consultation. I desired to write a letter to His Majesty the Shah myself a-nd state therein all the matters which I am duty bound to state both by Shara an se ^ ’ but I think it better to lay it before you, so that you may km y^ ay matter with full details and lengthy explanations, before His ^ ajes / Shah and impress the facts upon His Majesty’s mind again and again, show this very letter too and lay my excuse before Hm ^ a j 0S ^ troubling His Majesty by a separate letter.

There is no mention of Turcoman and Armenian fighting in later reports, except mas- •muck as individuals of these races may be enlisting in opposing parties.

Loss of revenue from Farman Parma's estates at Kermanshah, Hamadan and Miandoab has been caused by military operations or Russian requisitions paid for with depreciated rouble notes if at all. That these losses are directly due to his connection with us, he cannot pretend, though m respect of his two large properties near Tabriz, where Anglophobe democrats have fined him heavily of late, this plea could be put forward. He quotes these losses less to justify his claim on us than to explain his reason for fixing this part of price of his services.

Abadeh situa tion is critical. A village a mile to the south of town has been occupied by Mahomet Ali Khan who has promised his followers equal distribution of 200,000 tomans in the local Imperial Bank of Persia Branch. South Persia Rifles are not to be trusted, and Officer Commanding concluded by asking whether I can send him assistance. This is impossible unfortunately. It would be dangerous to weaken the Cossack garrison here, and I suggest assistance in lorm of a couple of armoured cars or better still aeroplanes if these are by any means available. The people here are already speaking of long interruption of communication between Shiraz and Ispahan, and if the wires should be cut between Abadeh and here of which I am apprehensive excitement would be increased, while mishap at Abadeh would have a most unfortunate effect. Hence it is as well as on account of anxiety for Abadeh garrison that I ad-&lt; vocate prompt measures. I could not help cars or aeroplaces here ; there is however plenty of petrol in Abadeh and measures I recommend would have good effect in Shiraz and this country. Ends.

''Vftfder is nil they require. Eemaininjr Bolshevik influence is confined to small strip along the railway from Kizil Arvat to Askabad and small number near Tashkent. In and near Tashkent German and Austrians prisoners of war number 9,000; in addition to these there are some 4,000* more scattered about.* All these prisoners have been recently equipped and reclothed, but they have not yet been armed. German and Turkish agents especially the former, are very active everywhere. Schmidt, cheif agent now in Bokhara; his* efforts to export cotton failed. Reliable Russian forces about 8,000 under Dutov near Orenburg and 5,000 on Bokhara-Tashkent line. It is proposed by the Russians to declare a Governor-Generalship over Turkistan including Orenburg-Vyorni-Krasnovodsk ;* this will declare in favour of Allies and old Russia and against the present Russian Government. Declaration will be i, ade in June. Representatives are very anxious to obtain the open support of England or temporary protectorate of England. They have been informed by me that this is not feasible, and I have asked them to call it “Turkistan Union” promising moral and financial support under certain conditions. The following is the line of action I have laid down: (1) The purchase of the Caspian naval and commercial fleet in toto immediately ; part of this fleet will voluntarily join the Union. (2) Strictest control over Krasnovodsk and no admittance of any enemy agents or persons whatever. (3) InternrAent of prisoners of war together with all agents. v 4) The formation of further necessary force (10,000 men approximately) under selected officers only, for the maintenance of internal order. Railways are in good order and the country is self-supporting with the Caspian fleet in their hands and necessary force near Orenburg to hold Tashkent line, the country can keep quiet and will form the base for future movements. The estimate of expenditure is with me and has been considered carefully. 20,000 roubles have been given to them here for preliminary expenses in collecting extra naval personnel for the fleet, the taking over of which will be the first step. Further financial assistance required is as follows;—two million at Meshed and the same amount at Tehran or other centre when required. This sum will be sufficient for two months after which also print currency will be in circulation. Two years* store of cotton lies on the Central Asian Railway; if necessary, it is agreed that half this should be exported to us md Resht and Persia. It is further very urgently requested by them that a small force of English or Indian troops should be sent. I submit that 6 selected officers and 200 men should f Omission. be (f) at Krasnovodsk; they could he sent now under pretext Consular guard to Meshed to await further orders for move on Askabad; this would suffice; only moral support is required. Cannot urge too strongly that all support shculd be given ; £450,000 is the actual cost to us, which, if successfully laid out, will have great effect ou India and Persia and may save us future millions. German aims are not only economic and material both in Trans-Caucasia and Turkistan, but they are directed at undermining our position in the East by all possible means. My telegrams Nos. 327 of February 28th and 351 of January 23rd and Tehran’s No. 23 of January 23rd should be referred to previous information is confirmed by numerous and later reports. Note .—Conditions in Turkistan are quite different from Russia proper wheie provinces are dependent to a certain degree on obtaining some arms* and ammunition* supplies from other parts of the country. Please pass to Foreign Office, have given* assurance that we* will* give* moral support* and assistance if decided and immediate action is taken on lines quoted. Keeping in touch via Baku with Krasnovodsk and with Kornilow near (Id)* s (Low*)odsk. Turkistan scheme will be of immense value if events in North Caucasus take a favourable turn. Of course* I await your* final sanction.* * 1 change.6 193 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 8624, dated the 2Sth June 1918.} Telegram P., No. M.

Information concerning the change of situation in Turkistan is still too meagre to enable me to form definite judgment, but I have hopes of that it means the realization of project outlined in your telegram. The question appears to be of immense importance and to offer the best solution to the problem of checking definitely an enemy advance to Afghanistan. L feel that we cannot support it too much and that not a moment should he lost in rendering such support. Your suggestion for line of action seems excellent. Comments on actual information as follows :— (1) Trans-Caspia generally, and particularly Askabad, has always been anti-Bolshevik. (2) It is reported that prisoners have been reclothed, but only those serving with Bed Guard have been armed. (3) Turkish and German agents reported very active. (4) Schmidt is Bolshevik Political Besident at Bokhara; 1 suspect he act s for Germans, but Bussians who know him doubt this. (5) It is not understood who the 5,000 reliable Bussians on Bokhara- Teckland line are. Possibly they include system sympathisers amongst the * Omission. population ( * ) Cossacks, &amp;e. t Omission.

From—The Secretary, War Office, London, To—The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D ”, Baghdad (repeated Commander-in-Chief in India, Simla). Begarding North-West Persia and the Caspian, His Majesty’s Govern- # Chan e ment are not satisfied that full advantage of our opportunities* is being taken by us, or that we are making our maximum effort in this region. The whole situation should be reviewed by you in the light of more recent information as regards local supplies and the lack of enemy activity in the plains of Mesopotamia. Information shows that at any rate for some time to come, the enemy does not intend to make any further effort in Mesopotamia. By the end of the year you will have received 10 Pord Van Companies and considerably more transport should he released on the completion of the collection of the Hillah harvest. In order to increase your supply of transport on the Resht road, transport on the other lines must be cut down to the barest limits. In short a greater and more sustained effort must he made in North Western Persia. His Majesty’s Government attach more importance to securing permanent control of the Caspian and (temporaryf t i cnange. controlf of) Baku, and to our success in that sphere, than appears to be appreciated by you. War Office concurs in this view. A railway survey beyond Khanikin towards Kermanshah should be pushed by you, and if railways prove impossible you should advise me as to the practicability of ropeways. The Khanikin-Resht road must be placed in the best possible state to stand traffic throughout next winter, and dep6ts must he energetically established along this road. It is necessary to show sufficient force at Kasvin to support our Minister’s policy at Tehran and to induce a Persian Government to subserve British interests, although there is no necessity to send troops to Tehran. Por this purpose a company or two of British Infantry is not sufficient. As regards Baku and Enzeli, we are still in the dark and feel that Dunsterville is not keeping you fully advised with inform ation on these places for he must surely be able at Resht to communicate with Bicharakov and get details as to the situation at Baku and the Caspian shipping. You should call on Dunsterville for a full appreciation on these points bearing in mind that it is not intended to permanently occupy Baku. If we can get complete control of the Caspian shipping destruction of the Baku pumping plant, pipe-line and oil reservoirs our present object is attained. Dunsterville should ask exactly what he requires in troops for this definite purpose, knowing as he presumably does, your transport problems and the present capacity of the Hamadan-Resht road. Until such considered opinion from you and Dunsterville is received we are unable to advise the War Cabinet regarding the despatch of troops to Baku. What your difficulties have been ami the rapid change of events which has, in the p^st, involved a rattier uncertain policy, is fully appre ciated. We are confident, however, that you will now realise that yourmain attention must be directed towards Persia and the Caspian, and that you will make a supreme effort to utilise as many troops as you are able to maintain in North-Western Persia both to accomplish our objects at Tehran at Baku and on the Caspian. 202 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 87 J9, dated the 2nd July 1918.)

Clear line. Eeference Chief of the General Staff, Simla, 50681, June 29th. The withdrawal of the Dehbid garrison to Abadeh has already been considered, but it is not thought feasible for so small a force to march for 60 miles through the enemy’s country. I am unable to communicate with Dehbid, but Officer Commanding, Abadeh, is being asked whether he can get a message through to them and also for his opinion on the possibility of their being able to join him. If it is possible for a couple of aeroplanes to be sent from the north to Ispahan they would be able to relieve the situation at Abadeh and at any rate they would put heart into the wavering South Persia Rifles. Dehbid might be able to join up with Abadeh under their cover. Regarding South Persia Rifles. I require a free hand to shoot any men deserting with arms and to delegate such authority to Officer Commanding, Abadeh. This officer, however, has little chance of capturing deserters at present; but it is not so much South Persia Rifles who require dealing with summarily as those who are attempting to undermine and seduce South Persia Rifles. I can answer for South Persia Rifles, Kerman, if I am allowed to prevent anti-South Persia Rifles propa gandists from entering Kerman and to eject those who are already there; but if intriguers are allowed free access to South Persia Rifles, as at present, it . . is impossible to say how far they may not Apparen om^sion. ^ successful. A strong* (hand) in this matter would give heart to South Persia Rifles and our adherents. The latter are dissatisfied with our present weak policy and our apparent inability to defend South Persia Rifles and ourselves from underhand attacks. This refers especially to such men as Moin-ush-Sheria and Sheikh Agha Yahya the present anti-South Persia Rifles leaders in Kerman, and also to the new Rais-i-Qushum Nasir-ed-Doulah and to several well-known democrats who left Kerman with the late Governor-General on deputation to Tehran, and who are now on their way to Kerman. It is well known that they are commissioned from Tehran to undertake a campaign against South Persia Rifles. 206 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 8736, dated the 2nd July 1918.)

There were six ships in harbour there on June 27th.la 208 Telegram P., No. 593, dated (and received) the 2nd July 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Obstinancy of Shah, who is hearing full brunt of resistance to formation of a Vossuq Cabinet, is so remarkable as to lead to conviction that the enemy has bought him. The alternatives put forward by Eastern Committee, whatever their merits may be, will not appeal to him or assist towards bringing a friendly administration in. Whatever the bargain between the Germans and the Shah his Germanophil adviser of His Imperial Majesty's entourage could not possibly have induced him to show such obstinate opposition to pressure of public opinion brought to bear on him, unless, they themselves believed and were able to convince him that our threat to bring in troops was only bluff and that the forces necessary are not at our disposal. Unfortunately they have good ground for this contention. We announced last March the despatch of troops and said that the point to which they would advance would depend on necessities of the situation. It was generally understood that that point was Hamadan or Easvin at furthest. Dunsterville however has been instructed to hold road as far as Enzeli, 200 miles beyond Kasvin, for this additional task he has only 1,100 men with a few armoured cars and aeroplanes, a force manifestly inadequate even for its^ original object. The insufficiency of his forces is to be supplemented by levies, a system condemned by himself, by Persian opinion and by Political Officer, Baghdad, as well as by War Office, as dangerous in that it confirms impression that we have not the troops to spare. Moreover, with the departure of Bicharakov's troops, we are militarily speaking actually in a weaker position than at any time since our intention of employing troops in North-West Persia was announced. Yet the need for it has become much more patent, now that Tabriz and all Western Azerbaijan has been occupied by Turks with troops in laro&gt; Q numerioal superiority to our forces. By collecting his whole force General Dunsterville would probably be a match for any forces Turks could send in direction of Kasvin at the present moment, but the Turks are apparently making preparations for advance in overwhelming strength. Withdrawal of our troops from Resht and Enzeli would in any case be great blow to our prestige, and we should have to recapture the places forcibly, in circumstances of much greater difficulty, or all idea of action at Baku and on the Caspian must be abandoned. 1 Central Persian situation also inspires serious misgiving. It is clear from the attack on South Persia Rifles at Abadeh that infection is spreading north from Pars. At Ispahan His Majesty’s Consul-General and Russian Officer Commanding Cossack Detachment, both write apprehensively lest disaffected Bakhtian Khans may seize opportunity to follow Soulat's example and endeavour to expel Cossacks. Central Persia would be thrown into a turmoil by such an event and the probable result would be the cutting of our telegraphic communications with India and the completing of the financial fSarsluat^ W6 aIread y threatened by check to trade resulting Advent of a friendly Cabinet to power would undoubtedly counteract these dangers. But the consciousness of their existence militates against that A ? d eTei J we succeeded in bringing Vossuq in without despatch of troops, he would require their support to enable him to act with energy and he would not long maintain himself without them. His fall would len-™ Tehran and North-West Persia wholly under the influence of the enemy I urge therefore that both the military and political situation demands immediate despatch of at least a brigade with artillery to Kasvin in addition to troops already under Dunsterville. Dunsterville has stated that he can deal with question of supplies locally. Prom such casual information as filters through to me from Mesopotamia, I understand that troops are available. I submit the effort must be made in order to avert collapsed our influence m this quarter of the world. * ^11 Attention is called to imperative necessity for financial reason of assuring Bandar Abbas trade route. According to Acting Consul, Kerman, loyalty of South Persia Rifles can be trusted for present. In view of our misplaced confidence m them m Pars, however, it would be obviously unwise to trust them especially should any disaster occur at Shiraz, in that case Kawam’s tribesmen would join Kashgais and other tribes in which case South Persia Rifles could not be expected to remain staunch. To me force which India proposes to send to Bandar Abbas appears quite inadequate to meet such a contingency, and it would be prudent to send much stronger column in hope of averting it. As regards advance from Bushire the forcing of passes on Shiraz road is a very formidable undertaking according to all military opinion Hence while recognise full importance of doing anything that will relieve Sykes, on possibility of which military authorities will pronounce, I should prefer the troops available for the purpose to be sent to Bandar Abbas rather than run undue risk of failure.

At my request, orders were sent by Russian Officer of Cossack Division to Ispahan detachment to send force to extricate British party at Abadeh if he considered after consultation with His Majesty’s Consul-General that situation allowed consequent weakening of Cossack detachment. Haig reports that the attitude of Bakhtiaries is so threatening as to make a reduction in strength inadvisable, that total Cossack force would be scarcely adequate for the task and that in any case, the Abadeh situation would be ended one way or the other before relief could arrive. I am urging the newly-appointed Governor-General, Ispahan, Amir Mufakham, and Sirdar Jang to send the Acting Governor Shahab-es-Sultaneh strong orders to prevent any disturbances in Ispahan and have also asked them to try to extricate Abadeh post.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. . According to most recent news from Ispahan it seems certain that situ ation is really serious and that the Bakhtiari Khans, with Murteza Quli Khan and Bibi Mariam at their head are working to bring off coup there. AmirMufakham and Sirdar Jang are doing tbeir best to restrain it. With his father as President of the Council and his uncle as Minister of War giving him something more than tacit support, however Murteza Quli may do something rash. I am about to threaten Samsam both as Prime Minister an£ as Bakhtiari. This may possibly prove effective for the moment, but until our troops reach Kasvin the danger will not be past. Concession of course would be useless. Any serious contretemps at Ispahan would radically affect Tehran situation for the worse. I earnestly trust every effort will be made to push up a brigade if possible to Kasvin with the least possible delay. We shall be incurring gravest risk if our operations are to be delayed until Mesopotamian harvesting is over. Por a demonstration towards Tehran two companies are not sufficient. They would not impress Persians and would only invite conflict. My own figures are the lowest possible with which to produce moral effect. Smaller forces would do more harm than good.

It will be recalled that some years ago the seditious tone of this man’s paper “ Islah ** caused its suppression and his deportation from India. Until recently he has been employed by the German Agent Wassmuss as an active anti-British pamphleteer. On February 25th last His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, gave a written undertaking to pay him Ts. 50 per month from that date for the period of the war in return for his departiwe from Kazerun and Dashtistan and public notifications of his withdrawal from politics. His Majesty’s Consul further agreed to advance him at once Ts. 500, recoverable after i2 months by monthfy instalments of Ts. 25, repayment of any balance of this advance outstanding on the declaration of peace to be waived. He has received the advance in full. The first instalment of repayment should be deducted from his pay for April 1919. He has received pay in full up to and for April 1918. He has been warned that payment will cease and steps he taken against him if he resumes his old activities, but since his journalistic abilities are probably at the service of the highest bidder, I recommend that he he kept under strict observation. 151 Telegram P., No. 565, dated the 19th (received 20th) June 1918. From— His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Efforts of Vossuq’s supporters to bring him into office seem likely to •ucct ed. But we have a good gauge of the strength of enemy influence with the Shah in the obstinate resistance he has been induced to offer to the appointment in suite of the clearest evidence of public opinion, which indicates that Vossuq’s position will he unstable unless we strengthen our position here. As reported m my telegram No. 539 the main argument urged on the Shah is prudence until the issue of the German thrust at Paris is known. The thrust has apparently been stopped for the present, but the stronger military position of the Germans in the west will probably be apowerful factor here for some time to come. Meanwhile other considera*inns like the imminence of the Turkish advance throughout Azerbaijan and their successes in Caucasus, are being urged. More cogent still is the inadequate fulfilmentof our announced intention to send troops to North-West Persia. Th# inadequacy of the forces we are sending is obvious ; otherwise, why it is urged, should we be raising local levies in so large numbers? So the conclusion forced on the Shah is that we have no troops to send and the same reflection naturally occurs to our friends’ minds. So encouraging to the enemy and so depressing to our friends is this economy in the use of our own troops that unless we take steps to show force, the position here, already jeopardised by the delay in the arrival of our troops, is in my opinion yet likely to b« nmuoh improved and would become even dangerous should Vossuq (if he come# in) be forced by the Shah to resign owing to some local event or intrigue. It must also be remembered that if Vossuq falls prematurely for want of our support, it would be impossible to reinstate him (? or bring in) second string, i.e., Akbar, by anything short of occupying capital. Political considerations in Tehran apart, there are others in provinces which seem to make a greater military effort essential. The Pars situation, which would never have developed to its present phase had there been no doubt as to reality of our military measures, is still anxious and cannot be relieved by reinforcements for some two months to come. What may happen in the meantime is impossible to foresee, but the sight of a British force shut up at Shiraz can only have a damaging effect on the Persian mind. Again although I do not believe Bakbtiari Khans will ever really combine against us* we cannof, with the audacity of Sirdar Mohtashim’s recent language before us ? shut onr eyes to probability that in that event some of most important Khan# may attempt some coup at Ispahan. Trade which has already suffered a verv severe check by events at Shiraz would practically cease and with it our financial resources if conditions at Ispahan became as bad as at Shiraz. I urge most strongly therefore immediate despatch of much stronger force to North-Western Persia than appears to be at present contemplated The numbers need not be very great, but apart from keeping the Enzeli road open or meeting a Turkish advance from Azerbaijan which seems unlikely they should be sufficient to garrison Kasvin and Hamadan in such strength’ as to permit of despatch of say 1,000 men in direction of Tehran and another column towards Ispahan in case of need. Presence of troops alone will probably suffice to preclude possibility of opposition, and guarantee Vossuq a position strong enough to deal with general situation. The possible necessity for a movement towards Tehran must always be kept in mind none the less. I venture to say a few words on the subject of levies although this is scarcely in my province. My Persian .friends are unanimous in condemning our efforts to create any organised or partly organised force under British officers among natives, and assure me that they would have little if any military value against reguiar troops, as was proved by experience of Germans in 191o ' 1 + b ’. tbat on ly ^ay local forces should be employed is to pay local leader# to use their followers to intercept agents, cut up convovs, &amp;c., that it is shere waste of money and personnel for us to do anything more ; and that it is much easier to secure loyalty by dealing with' chiefs than by reeruitin- indiscriminately. * a Addressed Foreign Office, London; repeated Baghdad. 152 Telegram P„ No. 109-C., dated (and received) the 20th June 1918.

I was promised by Prime Minister that he would send strongly worded telegram to Soulat. His attitude, however, was not satisfactory generally, and it seems probable from presence of Sirdar Mohtashim at Ministry of War that they may raise question of Cossack detachment at Ispahan and of Division. Samsam talked rather big about suppressing opposition by force. He admitted having threatened Firuz Mirza with arrest on a charge of intrigue, and I warned him strongly against so foolish measure, hinting that if he carried out bis threat I should protest to Shah. That he will venture on it I do not believe, but necessity of our supporting our friends by despatch of troops is shown by the fact that he actually suggested it at all.

Clear line. The situation in Shiraz had become serious by the evening «f June 17th. Orders were issued by the Mullahs and democrats to loot the louses and properry of South Persia Rifles personnel and of all civilians who lad worked for the British. In several cases, these orders were carried out. three Indians were seized near our lines, taken before the Mullahs, and lunged bv their orders. The Persian ranks of South Persia Rifles were nfuriated at the treatment they had received. Parmau Parma and the Consul agreed that it was necessary to have military measures in the city. In sommuuication with liawam, it was arranged that the Arabs should^ withdrawn into the Arab quarter in the eastern side of the city. The west nde is protected by Indian and South Persia Rifles cantonments.South Persia Rifles occupied Shahchiragh mosque and Madrasehi Khan, -two strong and commanding points in the city, and also Masjiid Nu, the meeting place of all the anti-British elements, during the night of June 17th- 18th. Early on the morning of June 18th, one company of Indian Infantry with Lewis guns and bombs, occupied a strong caravanserai at Kazeruni gate on the south-west side of the city, the only remaining unguarded exit, which is 600 yards beyond the end of the South Persia Rifles cantonment. We hav« arrested about twelve of the prominent anti-British agitators, but no Mullah* yet. At present, the city is quiet and the shops are being opened, but, natural ly, there is latent excitement. Our information received was that Soulat intended to attack Shiraz on the 17th June, and worked up simultaneous disturbances in the city. Thi* plan was upset by our attack towards Ohinar Rahdar on June 16th. During the past twenty-four hours Far man Farma has worked well. 157 Telegram P., No. 129, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) June 1918.

I have to-day had an interview with a representative of the Askabad Branch of “ Armenian Revolutionary Committee ”, who has just arrived here. It is apparently a universal Association of Armenians, with headquarters in the Caucasus, whose principal object is to free their countrymen from tha hands of the Turks. Be asks, (1), whether Caucasus Branch of the Society is in communica tion with us and if so whether they are to receive our assistance; and, (2), whether we are prepared to help the Trans-Caspian and Turkistan Branche* against the common enemy. He says that in the two provinces there are from 5 to 7,000 Armenians of military age capable of bearing arms who have already served in Russian Army. 2,600 of these are now under arms, 700 having weapons of their own, but the rest being armed by Maximalists are at their disposal and are liable to be sent by them to fight against Cossacks. Hence they wish to receive arms and ammunition for these 1,900 men from u* lather than from the Maximalists and hope that we will consider supply of arms for the force. 240 of the 700 who have arms of their own, are serving as town guards at Askabad, financed by themselves up to the end of May last and after that by Maximalists, and it is suggested by the Committee that we should undertake the responsibility of' financing the remaining 460 who will help to watch the line to Kransnovodsk and will give any help that may be required. Estimated monthly cost 50,000 roubles per 250 men. Local prices are 1,700 roubles per rifle and two for a cartridge. According to my visitor, political situation of communities other than Aimenians is, Turkomans doubtful, but would probably join the stronger side and would take action with us in the ev^nt of our force arriving in their oountiy first: Persians have received strict orders to remain neutral* Caucasian Turks about 3,000 are in favour of the Turks. It is suggested by Russian Consul-General that it would be advisable to institute negotiations ^ with the Maximalists as is being done from lleshfc. Comparative qu t et reigns over the border and we should in wy opinion proceed to send an officer to Tashkent, &amp;o., to sound views of the Maximalists and to pave the way tor the proposed mission which should be prepared to proceed early. 1 r 6,000 rifles or more with ammunition should, in my opinion, he sent as soon as possible to Mesned for distribution under orders from His Majesty’s Government on our recommendation and for arming levies in the event of proposal made in my telegram of the 8th June, 119 being favourably considered Addressed Tehran.1 158 Telegram P., No. 5256, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) June 1918.

My reply was that troops have come in consequence of Soulat and Nasr-i- Divan’s hostile acts but that no orders for their employment have been received yet. If desired it will probably be possible to arrange that these chiefs should not oppose the advance of our troops, and this would, in my opinion, be done without any promise of pardon for past offences. All that would be necessary would be to proclaim that if they and their people did not oppose the advance or appear armed near our troops, they would not be molested.

It appears to he indicated by Dunsterville’s telegram G.-955, June 22nd to General Officer Commanding, Baghdad, that it is not contemplated to send him additional troops although his force is inadequate even to hold Kasvin-Enzeli road safely, much less to support Christian element in Azerbaijan or exercise political pressure on Tehran and elsewhere. Moreover mobilised column originally intended, I understand, for Persian as distinct from Caucasian purposes, has lost somewhat of its value by its partial employment north of Political situation here will be seriously jeopardized if this is so Vossuq’s supporters, urged and financed by me, have been holding nightly demonstra tions for the last week at chief mosque in bazaar, headed by some of the chief Ulemas and many of the chief moderate politicians. At last, after a month's work, there is every prospect of a friendly cabinet being brought in and of Vossuq taking office as popular candidate. Such is Persian intrigue however that various groups tl.at have united to bring him in. will soon fall apart, and that Vossuq will tall after a few weeks unless we can give him visible support and enemy faction will return to office. We cannot even bluff with the foree Dunsterville mentions; for the strength of our forces is accurately known. Without further troops we should he trying without force to carry out a policy of which force is the basis.

Samsam’s selection possibly throws some light on attitude of Khans [vide my telegrams No. 525 and 529) who appear to me anxious to show that they are not less “ patriotic ” than Soulat, their design being to gain the support of the extremist party for a revival of a Bakhtiari Cabinet. We must, however, anticipate that Samsam will utilise his position to insist on the removal of Cossack detachment from Ispahan. This they will he unable to resist, and ifc may of course bring on the tapis the whole question of the Cossack division and of our financing them. On the other hand, if we acquiesce in withdrawal, while that question may still be raised, we shall see Bakhtiaris virtually masters of Ispahan, Persia's central point.

No plausible explanation was given for his visit and it seems not improbable that there may be some design at the back of his visit in view of his adherence and acceptance of office in Mustaufl-ul-Mamalik’s Cabinet and of the Khans’ very dubious language in the last few days.

Feeling is strong against Samsam-es-Sultaneh in Tehran but he expresses confidence about forming his ministry. I am fairly convinced, both from my own conversation with the Shah and from other indications, that Shah will have to be coerced into accepting Vossuq and the latter’s supporters are therefore reparing to exercise pressure by closing bazaars, &amp;c.

Hence, if we are to give Vossuq support he wants and to make our position safe, we must show that we are masters in North Persia at all events and we must be prepared to strengthen considerably our forces at Kasvin so that we can bring troops nearer the capital if necessary, , This refers to my telegram No. 539.

Clear line. No material change in the position at Shiraz. The attitude of South Persia Rifles of Pars more satisfactory and possibly half of them at Shiraz might stand with us even if invested. Report from Major Fraser at Abadeh states that South Persia Rifles at Abadeh quiet and have taken same oath as at Shiraz of fidelity to British officers and South Persia Rifles, after receiving telegram sent by Persian officers at Shiraz. This is encouraging but Persians regard oaths lightly. Report from Farran states attitude South Persia Rifles of Kerman Brigade remains satisfactory. Kashgai, the ^Deputy Governor of Abadeh, is trying to raise his adherents against Abadeh and is intriguing with South Persia Rifles and threatens to attack Abadeh. Captain Abaduggan Nunbid reports that local Arabs collected in vicinity and are ready to attack if Kawan orders. On June 4th a convoy of Transport under Manson with escort under Captain Field reached Kharameh and was due on the 7th at Niriz. From Kharameh, Field wrote that inhabitants there showed unfriendly attitude and were awaiting news of success by Soulat before committing themselves. There is no doubt that the ringleaders of the Arab tribes would be openly hostile if they thought affairs were going against us. There seems no doubt that a big plot throughout Pars has not hitherto matured successfully and simultaneously, firstly, because of action against Arabs by Column under Grant, secondly, because the disarmament and operations of Khan-i-Zinian of 10/14th May prematurely dislocated their plans. Thirdly, the defeat of Soulat on May 25th has again upset their plans and caused many to hesitate.6 125 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7629, dated the 11th June 1918.) Telegram P., No. 179—85-G., dated (and received) the 9th June 1918. ♦ From—G eneral Sykes, Shiraz, T 0 —The Chief of the General Staff, Simla (repeated Minister, Tehran). Clear line. With reference to Minister’s 77. Paragraph 1. Staff and I postulate the following axioms :— Firstly. Without reasonable honesty and straightforwardness on the part of Persian officials as represented by their government no purely Persian force, whether officered by British or neutrals, can effectively restore and maintain order in Persia. Secondly. To protect main roads effectively robber tribes must be followed up and punished. Thirdly. Tribes are too strong and too well armed to subdue them by regular troops. ^ ; ^ ^ ^ n ;; r . Fourthly. The main cause of the trouble in Southern Persia is the formidable collection of well armed men who closely envelop the Shiraz road. Disorders will always occur in Fars until the Soulat-W^assmuss combine is dealt with. Paragraphs. Breaking up of Soulat-Wassmuss combine would enable the present force of Indian troops aided by South Persia Rifles to maintain order in Persia if no outside events occurred to make the general situation worse, South Persia Rifles in Pars could be reduced by one battalion and one cavalry regiment and this would make a more rapid elimination of the unsatisfactory element possible. i - : s Paragraph 3. The disbandment of the South Persia Rifles, Fars Brigade, would leave two alternatives :— Firstly. To evacuate Fars and concentrate in Kerman Province. Secondly. To increase Indian troops in Fars to about 10,000 men because a purely Indian garrison would be regarded as an occupation and excite increased hostility. Tribes are strong and the area is large. In addition disbandment would encourage anti-British party as a sign of success and would re-act unfavourably on the military situation in Persia. Paragraph 4. Unless nationality were such as Norwegian, placino- of South Persia Rifles under neutrals, would, during the ivar, be difficult. 0 To place Indian troops alongside of South Persia Rifles officered by neutrals would be impossible, perhaps possible solution would be to have American officers for South Persia Rifles, Fais, and to withdraw Indian troops to Kerman Province to act in emergency as a support to Americans. Paragraph 5. South Persia Rifles at Kerman have hitherto been satisfactory. South Persia Rifles at Fars handicapped by the following facts :— 3 («) Unsatisfactory ^-Swedish gendarmes. (&amp;) Constant calls for escorts’ outposts and operations during training and organisation. (a) Fars is a hot bed of intrigue. (d) Proximity of Soulat-Wassmuss combine. Paragraph 6. Famine prices and unfavourable exchange rates are main causes of present high cost of force. Paragraph 7. It appears undesirable to lock up in Southern Persia more than minimum of Indian troops compatible with our main obiecfs of preventing incursion of enemy and keeping routes open. If Soulat-Wassmuss combine is broken up in early autumn and Busbire-Shiraz road is opened, the Expeditionary Force for this purpose could probably then be withdrawn and South Persia Rifles with present Indian escort could continue their former duties.izs 7 Paragraph 8. Witli a hostile Persian Cabinet trouble is always likely to recur in Southern Persia. Present situation is the direct result of attitude of ]V1 ukhbir-es-Sultaneh who, while he was Minister of Interior, incited tribes to attack and raid and incited Persian officials of all classes against South Persia Hides and against British. 126 (Recehed with Army Department memorandum No. 7629, dated the 11th June 1918.)

The first I heard of Consul’s views regarding the future of the South Persia Rifles was, when I received a copy of Minister s telegram No. 70, based on these views about South Persia Rifles.

Before despatch, Grey’s telegram No. 119-0., of Sth June, was discussed with me. As matters stand at present, the extension of existing levv or forma tion of new levy for Khorasan from Hazaras seems to promise better than organisation of tribal force. Different classes are tapped for Indian Army and Levy recruits and in the past one has not affected the other, and Meshed is undoubtedly the best centre from which to commence levy recruitment. It might also be training point, Punjabi instructors on the spot being utilised to save time, but some transfer, from existing levy, of seasoned Hazaras would be necessary.9 In my opinion such levies would require backing of regular troops, and, in view of conditions and possible enemy movements m Turkistan^ L am of opinion that the stronger we can afford to he on the spot the less chance there is of Turcoman and other races throwing in their lot with the enemy. Should it be decided to increase Levies, no time should be lost in despateh- insr arms and ammunition from India.

Tartar7 who recently advanced along the railway towards Ajikabul but were dnven back by troops from Baku, will facilitate progress eastwards. Some slight delay may be caused by repairs to railway.

To officially confer on military authorities very large power to intervene in political affairs which would he result if Sykes’ request is acceded to, would . k e i n my opinion to perpetuate a mistake which has contributed not little to break down of onr policy in South Persia. The fact is that {he command of the British forces is vested in the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, is at the bottom of the mischief for the two commands are totally incompatible. The Inspector-General as commanding a Persian force acts nominally on authority of Persian Govern ment in person of Governor-General; while the Officer Commanding British troops is responsible to Government of India and the temptation is foi the latter role to obscure the former and be used almost undisguised ly to further British interests. This became so evident early in April, that Governor-General expressed his serious misgivings at change he noticed in our policy both to Gough, to Sykes and his staff—a fact of which I have only just learnt through a private letter from Governor-General communicated to me confidentially* As you are aware there has been a dangerous strain between the unequal relations of the Governor-General and Inspector-General. The natural result has been to provide a handle to enemy propaganda all over Persia while the ground has been prepared in the south for native intrigue. Hence if we are to retrieve ill-consequences of early errors if that is possible it appears essential that so far from giving military authorities laige voice in political affairs, we must strengthen political officers so as not to allow large political issues to he effaced. We must not forget necessity for main taining lacade of Persian authority is irresistible. Again, double command combined with necessity for using Indian troops to ensure against a military reversal has resulted in South Persia Bifles being forced into position of local levies auxiliary to foreign army of occupation from its real character of a Persian gendarmerie. Perhaps it was too much to expect of any commandant administrative officer to keep two characters apart, especially with a staff largely Indian, inevitably disposed by their training in radically different political conditions to act as if they w 7 ere dealing with subject races and to forget that their real role was that of instructors placed at an independent country’s disposal.

Governor-General has received messages from Soulat and priests suggest ing that they wdll make him king of South Persia if he joins them. Bazaars are still closed and Governor-General’s soldiers are openly insulted and cursed, and a rifle was taken from one of them. Governor-General expects at any moment open opposition to his authority in town. Before ordering his Arabs to declare war against Soulat, Kawam awaits reply regarding the assurances he demands.

It must be remembered, with regard to your request for aeroplanes, that they require aerodromes, repair facilities, skilled personnel, spare parts, supplies of petrol, replenishment of bombs, etc., which, without previous preparations, cannot be provided at Shiraz or en route. Aeroplanes therefore cannot be made available to assist in the present situation. 3. It is presumed, with regard to last paragraph of your telegram under reply, that steps will be taken by you to bring in any outlying posts which you think are in danger and in any case it is not clear how an aeroplane could afford any material help. 48 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7109, dated the 80th May 1918.)

This was notified in an * Group omitted. unnumbered unofficial telegram to Barman parma from Samsam. Staff and I consider, on further consideration following fuller information, that to organise and utilise a force at Bushire sufficiently strong and mobile would take too long, and it would be sufficient to reinforce Bnshire enough only, for offensive movements in hinterland of that place which with support of aeroplanes would be feasible. Transport and some stocks of supplies are available on the Bandar Abbas road and staff and I recommend early despatch of the following Two Indian cavalry squadrons which are already promised plus two seasoned battalions Indian infantry and one battery of Indian mountain Artillery with the necessary departmental details. In the worst case, opposition on road from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz is not likely to exceed 4 or 5,000 and country comparatively easy. Harvesting now beginning and crops are good. Am issuing orders to&gt; Bandar Abbas to collect all available transport there. Military activity in vicinity of Bushire will act as a deterrent against Wassmuss’s schemes. Advance of reinforcing column from Bandar Abbas will discourage Soulat and democrats and encourage Barman Barma and Kawam. Shiraz remains quiet at present. Arrangements being made for arrest of certain prominent hostile democrats. Consul is in entire agreement.49 (Received with Army Department memorandum Np. 71Q9, dated the 30th May 1918.)

From Marshall’s telegram it would appear that the finding of transport for a force in any way approaching the strength of two brigades would be impracticable. I should be glad to have Sykes* views regarding nature of support he may require and also regarding his future position at Shiraz and the status of Soper. Perhaps a smaller force than that suggested by you would suffice if sent from Bandar Abbas; if so, could it be found from India. 50 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7170, dated the 31st May 1918.)

It is not proposed to ask Marshall for troops or transport, in view of the telegram No. X.-9092 of May 27th from General Officer Commanding, Porce “ D ”, Baghdad. 3. Telegram No. 179—44-G., dated May 2Sth, from Sykes, contains his latest views. It was repeated to you under my 41962 of May 29th, but the Shiraz situation is obscure and on receipt of answers to further quiries addressed to Sykes, a further report will be sent. Your request for his views on his future position at Shiraz and the status of the South Persia Rifles has now been repeated to him and he has also been directed to furnish the opinion of the Consul. 4. Action taken at present; two battalions have been ordered to Bushire and a half battalion to Bandar Abbas. It is hoped that Sykes can hold out in Shiraz until October in which case it is proposed to despatch a column of one brigade, one battery, one company C. and M. to Kazerun from Bushire, if then considered necessary. The intervening months will be utilised by the reinforcement how going to occupy the low country and to improve communications up to Daliki, thus reducing pack transport to 7 days supplies for column or 7i Mule Corps approximately. 5. The operations from Bandar Abbas will depend upon the attitude of the tribes along the road, but (this apart) the advantage of Bushire over Bandar Abbas are as follows :— (a) The distance is shorter. (5) The port of disembarkation is better. (c) Better base facilities in shape of buildings, etc. . v' III M|M IJIMSjllWipulMi 4 (d) The risk of increasing the disturbed area is less. At this time of the year both Bandar Abbas and Bushire are hot and unhealthy. 51 (Received with Army Deparment memorandum No. 7170, dated the 31st May 1918) Telegram P., No. 59203 (Cipher)-M.

It is very strongly urged that these units proceed to Egypt and are not divert ed to Bushire or the Persian Gulf. It does not appear desirable or necessary to reinforce Sir P.

It is considered by staff and myself that two battalions, one mountain battery and two squadrons is the maximum force that could be mavedupfrom Bandar Abbas and that this force would be sufficient to deal with any opposition offered on the line Shiraz-Niriz-Tarum. The certainty of reinforcements will put Kawam whole-heartedly on our side ?&gt; rV,r eUt w 6 P romises to furnish ample transport to Shiraz from Bandar Abbas. We recommended, in addition, reinforcements for Bushire to undertake operations inland but neither numbers nor objectives were specified. Our opinion is hat about 6,000 or 7,000 reinforcements required for Bushire whose objective to be Kazerun. In Shiraz there are independent supplies for two months, and enough for a third month can be obtained from new harvests m this valley either by purchase or seizu™ TnTu; Secondly. Soulat will be attacked if a favniimBi* itself.

Your 41963, May 29th.iggaagjaeHsaweai ssa M i iwaa'i'i'istix i'ii ji i iij'f &lt;«.f uri i-gii«w * taessaw Regarding military support and future position of Shiraz, views have already been f amished. Regarding South Persia Rifles. Until recently the force was loyal and contented and making good progress many minor military successes against raiders having been achieved. Staff and I* are entirely convinced that sudden grave disaffection of South Persia Rifles mainly amongst the Swedish gendarmes in Pais, is due to the repudiation of the force by the Persian Government and the anti-British campaign engineered by Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, Minister of the Interior, and others. Their action was mainly caused in its present • Group corrnpt. * he not e delirered by the Lega- tion which provoked an unfriendly reply from the Persian Government and which led to desertions on a large scale and the ghastly tragedy at Khaneh Zinian. We were not consulted by the Minister in his negotiations with relation to the force although our military position in Southern Persia was affected by them as Soulat’s action clearly proves. It is due to staff and myself to state this fact. Unless the Persian Government horrified by the tragedy for which it is responsible, again recognises South Persia Rifles either provisionally or permanently, the force may possibly have to be disbanded in Pars. At present there is little disaffection in Kerman. Officers and men have been allowed the choice of resignation and a bonus has been offered to those remaining to the end of the war. News of an advance from Bushire inland, together with further local successes, might enable us to retain a hold on the bulk of South Persia Rifles. Consul considers that in present state South Persia Rifles are of little value and a danger ; that Indian Army officers are better for -South Persia Rifles than juniors of British Service without Asiatic experience; and that more Indian troops are necessary for safety. Consul has knowledge only of Pars where Swedish gendarmes predominate. 54 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7177, dated the 3lit May 1918.) Telegram P., No. 42435, dated the 30th May 1918. From—His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India, Simla, To—The Secretary, War Office, London. Clear line. “ Operations ”, 1. It is mentioned in your telegram of May 29tb, No. 59203—M. 0.-2, that it is neither desirable nor necessary to reinforce Sykes, but this is not the view held by either the Consul or himself, as you will see from Sykes’ views, asked for in your telegram of May 28th, No. 69i63-D.M.O. and repeated to you in my 42357 of May 30th. 2. A discussion regarding the control of the South Persia Rifles was com menced in correspondence beginning with Secretary of State for India’s cable of January 9th, 1917, No. 3431, and ended with Viceroy’s telegram of May 19th, 1917, No. 7350. It will be seen from this that the War Cabinet decided in Secretary of State 3456 of March 19th, 1917, that Sykes shall remain under Mailing’s orders. This is the position to-day. However, so far as I know, Marling has issued no orders to Sykes as to his action in present difficulties. 3. It will be seen from Sykes’ own telegram that he proposes two lines of operation, via Bandar Abbas and Bushire. In neither case, however, could reinforcements reach him in less than two months from date of departure from India, and Sykes must be prepared to maintain his position in Shiraz for this period.6 4. It is probable that the disarmament and disbandment of the Fars Brigade, South Persia Rifles, will be necessary. Marling should now order Sykes to carry it out, if this is so. 5. I am proceeding with the preparatory measures reported in my telegram of May 29th, No. 41977 in the meantime, so as to be in the best position to help Sykes, should the War Cabinet so direct. 6. However, I press for precise orders on the subject of control of these operations as the duality which now exists will surely result in inefficiency. 7. You may wish to reconsider the opinion expressed in your telegram under reply in view of the above explanation. I shall continue to take action until I hear from you again, Your attention is invited to Viceroy’s telegram No. 589-S. of May 29th to Secretary of State regarding the situation in Shiraz. 56 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7298, dated the 4th June 1918.)

Yesterday Persian officers all solemnly swore loyalty to South Persia Rifles and British officers before Mullah. There has been but one resignation. The position is considered slightly better by Officer Commanding, Pars Brigade. Farman Parma has sent a telegram to Persian Government strongly condemning Khaneh Zinian tragedy and hinting that only solution is to again recognise South Persia Rifles. Enquiry about tragedy proceeding. Persian opinion is that, owing to British note having been presented without force to secure acceptance of terms, it provoked definite reply with anti- British agitation and thereby caused desertions and open hostility of Soulat. Persians consider if reinforcements be despatched speedily and operations undertaken in Bushire Hinterland situation, will be restored and that Parman Parma and Kawam will support us. 57 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7300, dated the 4th June 1918 ) Telegram P., No. 296—8-CJ., dated the 1st June 1918. From*—The Administrative Staff, Shiraz, To—The Base Commandant, Bandar Abbas (repeated Kerman, Saidabad and Chief of the General Staff, Simla, for information). Reference Bandar Abbas A.-5—138 and Saidabad T.-418, May 30th. The reinforcements from Bandar Abbas must march to Saidabad via Tarum, but the subsequent march to Shiraz from Saidabad will be dependent on the situation at that time. Saidabad with its munitions and stores must be the first point of assembly for reinforcements which may reach that place in echelons, Tarum and especially Saidabad must consequently be well stocked with food supplies. Por the present no convoy from Saidabad should be despatched to Shiraz or Niriz. As already ordered, bulk of transport animals now at Saidabad should be sent to Bandar Abbas. Parman Parma and Rawam have promised i,000 donkeys at Shiraz. 150 Persian mules will he added to these, and it is intended to despatch these 1,150 animals from Shiraz to Saidabad under Major Manson, and an escort composed partly of South Persia Rifles and partly of Rajputs to assist Saidabad on marches of einforcements and supply work. f£it of reinforcements can be brought„ *?v /•-.ry-gase&amp;utai.Lii ■w»wi jiiwnnir^ rr\ down to minimum tentage and one blanket per man and one pair of boots, 2 # B 1 h e pairs of socks spare per man.

Local supplies will be available at I£atru, Niriz, Kharameb, &amp;c., as new harvest is plentiful; some specie must be brought up to Shiraz by reinforcements. Along road Bandar Abbas-Tarum Saidabad, no serious opposition anticipated. 58 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7300, dated the 4th June 1918.) Telegram P., No. 179—57-G., dated the 1st (received 2nd) June 1918. From— Sir Percy Sykes, Shiraz, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla (repeated Minister, Tehran, Bushire and Baghdad). • . . There has been no material change in the military situation. According to reliable Persian information, German money is being freely spent among Kashgais and at Shiraz. It is reported that Wassmuss left Kazerun May iOth in the direction of Khaneh Zinian with 3 or 4 other Germans. Soulat is still near Dorinjun with about 2 or 3,000 men endeavouring to incite tribes and raise jehad. A few Arabs are with him. Pamilies and flocks of the Kashgais have moved back to Maimand Hills near Piruzabad and the families and flocks of Soulat section of E.ashqulis into hills east and south-east of Dasht Arjan. Around Dasht Arjan and Khaneh Zinian are about 2,000 men of Kashqulis and Kashgais. Kawam with 1,000 Arabs and Dushmanziari followers is at Shiraz. He would like to see Soulat broken, but a good deal of Persian and Mullah influence is being brought to bear on Kawam who is not likely to commit himself too openly at present. In the meantime some sections of Arabs are somewhat out of hand from Kawam. So far Gough is handling Kawam question with success. South Persia Rifles troops remain quiet, but at present juncture it would be dangerous to trust them in Pars. 59 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7300, dated the 4th June 1918.) Telegram P., No. 179—59-G., dated the 2nd (received 3rd) June 1918. From— Sir Percy Sykes, Shiraz, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla (repeated Minister, Tehran, and Baghdad). Clear line. We have had no communication for some days owing to the telephone to Niriz being cut. On June 2nd a letter was received from Captain Williams (dated May ‘30th) saying that all was quiet then. Major Hunter reached Niriz in a motor and is detained there. New and friendly Deputy Governor is leaving Shiraz,' for Niriz ^ullah’s and mounted men are reported to have been sent by Soulat, via Pasa to create trouble on our lines of communication with Bandar Abbas. Nasr Divan’s men, based at Khaneh Zinian, are said to be truculent, and parties of his men have advanced to Deh Sheikh to-day and have been truculent in the Hills on the west side of Chinar Rahdar. The attitude of Kawam’s Arabs and of South Persia Rifles at Shiraz require careful watching still. A sepoy was severely wounded in the arm by a rifle shot just outside wall of lines last night.60 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7359, dated the 5th June 1918.)

The factors to be considered are as follows :— (а) The Soulat’s influence centres in the district between Shiraz and Bushire where the German Wassmuss is assisting him. (б) The Soulat cwm-Wassmuss hostilities will continue unless and until order is restored in the Bushire hinterland. (c) Sykes should be able to maintain his position until the autumn and in the meantime news of reinforcements landing at Bushire combined with preparations for advance to Daliki will at once make Soulat apprehensive and retain in Bushire hinterland tribesmen who might otherwise join him. W T e should in this manner promptly apply pressure in support of the Persian Government’s efforts to restore order. (d) Owing to lack of transport and supplies the movement of two battalions from Bandar Abbas will have to he carried out by echelons at 2 to 3 days’ interval. They will scarcely affect the situation until they reach Saidabad, 16 marches from Bandar Abbas. (e) Even supposing that these battalions will arrive at Shiraz by August 15th, Sykes will then have to advance against Soulat without any assistance from Bushire. On the other hand, preparations at Busbire now should ensure our readiness by October 1st to land additional troops at Bushire to advance on Kazerun thus placing the Soulat between two fires (see my 41977, dated 29th May). (/) Bandar Abbas is climatically and from the point of view of facilities a worse base than Bushire. 2. I decided for these reasons to— (a) prepare and reinforce at Bushire; (5) despatch drafts numbering about 500 rifles plus 2 squadrons from Bandar Abbas now; Sykes has ordered for these the collection of transport of supplies. 3. Does His Majesty’s Government still consider that no reinforcement should go to Bushire and that two battalions should forthwith reinforce Sykes from Bandar Abbas ? J 4. Two battalions are required in either case, so the 2/107th Pioneers and 3rd Kashmir Bifles are being placed in substitution for the battalions directed to the Persian Gulf, under orders for Egypt; the latter having been specially mobilised for Persia and being due to embark on June the 7th and 8th. 61 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7359, dated the 5th June 1918.) Telegram P., No. 179—61-G , dated the 3rd June 1918. From— Sir Percy Sykes, Shiraz, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla (repeated Minister, Tehran, Baghdad and Bushire). ° Clear Une. Conditions on which Consul is reporting fully have been offered by Soulat to barman Earma to the effect that British should a°ree not to enter his territory nor to interfere with his tribes whose robberies°d 0 not concern them, contingents from Kazerun, Borasjun, Daliki also further Ivashgais have reinforced Soulat, and he has about 9,000 men within 25 miles of Shiraz. Within a week he expects further contingents. He is now leader of a powerful confederacy engineered by German brains and supported byGerman money—and no longer merely Chief of the Kashgais. Kawam and barman Parma are with ns, but the former confesses his inability to answer for his Arab tribesmen frankly. At present the town is quiet, but if the Indian troops should be invested or defeated, neither it nor the South Persia Rifles can be relied on. It is considered by Consul, Parman Parma and Kawam that position can only be restored by prompt despatch of force to Bushire strong enough to march inland, apart from despatch of reinforcements Did Bandar Abbas. A dash out from Bushire followed by a retirement would only make matters worse. Possibly, it is considered, Soulat may perhaps be kept busy parleying for another week, but the Bushire force should be ready to begin to advance within that period. An extraordihary impression would be produced by aeroplanes or sea planes working in conjunction with it. Staff and Consul entirely agree with me in considering position critical. An immediate decision is required on the whole question of our policy in South Persia. Affairs have reached a stage where we can only remain in Pars by immediate application of sufficient force inland from Bushire to draw away Soulat’s army before Soulat can closely invest the Indian troops at Shiraz, and thereby attract to himself all waverers. To enable us to reassure Parman Parma and Kawam and so keep them on our side, an early reply as to military relief measures is requested. 62 Telegram P., No. 501, dated the 4th (received 5th) June 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Immediate application of force as outlined in Gough’s proposal No. 1, Seems to me safest course if it is practicable as I hope is the case. Judged by his letter Soulat seems to be slightly less anxious to try conclusions with us. But it is impossible to trust him, and the situation will, therefore, not be met by negotiations on lines he suggests. They would be taken as a sign of weakness and might encourage him to renew his attack. To sit tight waiting for reinforcements from Bandar Abbas is clearly dangerous, in view of doubtful attitude of Kawam’s tribesmen, who could delay march of troops until too late for Shiraz to be relieved. Advent of a Vosug Cabinet might provide some assurance against this. German successes on Marne however will have their inevitable effect on our influence here, and while our troops are still only moving towards Hamadan and Kasvin wa cannot count upon so stalwart a Vosug as I otherwise hoped, especially at first.

Hemocratics here recently secretly discussed. (1) Following reputed plan of campaign :— After the harvest Afghanistan will be sent a signal from Turkey to enter the war and will advance on India supported by Turkish Force via Turkistan. Baluchis will cut Sistan communications and Bujnurd, Kucban and the Persian Turcomans combine against British in Khorasan, chiefs of Bujnurd and Kuchan sinking their antagonistism in the common cause. (2) Bujnurd, Kuchan, Janglis and Turcomans will bar North-East Persia against British opposition. Turks advance via Trans-Caspia. It is improbable that the Persians have evolved this unaided. In con nection with above the following contributory circumstances deserve con sideration :— (a) So-called Commercial Mission of exceedingly suspicious nature and largely of Jewish composition is in Khorasan. The purchase of dried fruit was ostensibly their reason for coming but none has been purchased so far. They have hired a large caravan of the sarais especially at Kuchan and have probably purchased a portion of grain harvest beforehand. The Trans-Caspian harvest prospects according to Caucasian newspapers are favourable. Austrian prisoners on arrival at Kuchan have twice asked for members of the Mission by name. (5) Feuds between Chiefs of Bujnurd and Kuchan seem temporarily composed. (c) Janglis are intriguing with Turcomans. (d) Change of attitude of Saiyid Haidar Hazara.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. I beg to submit my views briefly on the future of South Persia Eifles which is a matter on which some definite policy must very shortly he adopted. Given a full and sincere recognition by the Persian Government it is pos sible that the South Persia Eifles may cease to be (what I have always feared it would prove) a military as well as a political liability to us. Eecent events at Shiraz, however, make it clear that any such recognition can be temporary- only, pending some arrangement for the substitution of British by neutral officers. Except in the event of alliance with Persia this seems to be in evitable if the force is to be preserved, whatever the political complexion of the Cabinet for the time being may be. The only difference would be that a Cabinet that is hostile will show itself less reasonable than one that friendly. The only alternative X can see—and I believe it to be soundec course—is to disband it wholly or greater part. Many disadvantages attend its maintenance. We might, in most favour able circumstances, obtain temporary recognition in accordance with Motamin- ul-Mulk’s formula (see my telegram No. 15, January 8th) with the modifica tion that the substitution of neutral for British officers should take place as soon as possible and not be deferred till the end of the war. Such substitution, however, must take time, and such is the short life of a Persian Cabinet that it is on the cards that an extremist Cabinet would repudiate the recognition (as happened last year), in which case the South Persia Eifles would be no more trustworthy than to-day, and intrigues would he set on- foot to undermine its loyalty even if matter did not reach so serious a pitch as now. Let us assume, however, that this is too pessimistic a view, and that the substitution difficulty is overcome. What is to be done with our own troops ? To withdraw them and leave 7,000 troops under neutral officers at the orders of a possibly hostile Government, so long as the war lasts, seems dangerous; to leave the' two forces side by side would raise endless difficulties. Then again there is the question of expense of the South Persia Eifles which, on its present vast scale, Persian Government could not possibly meet for years to come -. without our assistance. It appears necessary to send reinforcements to Sykes; and it seems to me we can equally efficiently and certainly more cheaply andsafely employ them rather than the South Persia Rifles to keep order along the trade routes which is a matter of first importance to enable us to finance ourselves throughout Persia. As to whether the disbandment should be total , or partial this would depend on various circumstances. There may be political advantage in retaining a nucleus of force and it might possibly still be of practical value as a police force, e.g., in Kerman, where the only probable i danger is the tribal combination such as that which Soulat has contrived. Disbandment would mean that a considerable number of trained men are set free to take service with Soulat or with the Germans. This is no doubt a disadvantage, but it is perhaps less dangerous than for the same men to be kept on as an armed force possibly disloyal. Should we decide on disbandment, our explanation to the Persian Govern ment would simply be that Government have no intention of wasting money further on what would have been valuable force had not Persian intrigue ruined it, but will keep sufiBcient force of their own troops during the war in South Persia so long as the defence of their interests require it.

To me neither of the alternatives put forward by the Governor-General seem quite free from the objection of involving him with the Persian Govern ment. If he is to render us real services it would be much better to avoid this and I should prefer giving him a monthly allowance on condition that he gives us all possible information regarding escaped enemy prisoners of war and agents and leaves to us their capture and subsequent disposal. I even suggest giving him a substantial bonus for every capture effected in con sequence of information he supplies. I believe Governor-General to be well disposed. He will net compromise himself however very far for us in eyes of his countrymen which he would have to do if he kept up a force which we armed and financed. In general, however I am averse to giving arms as we can never be sure into whose hands they may fall.

According to this week’s reports from Herat German party confidently expect early arrival of a Turco-German force on Afghan frontier. Similar reports, spread by enemy spies and agents, are current in democratic circles here. We are threatened with possibility of eventual enemy advances through Mazandran and also Trans-Caspia, though when if ever these movements will develop is not known. Military Attache, Tehran, has asked General Staff Officer whether Hazaras and other tribes could be organised to resist Janglis. Our opinion is that, with the possible exception of Hazaras, Khorasan will move with Persian Govern ment who are expected shortly to issue a final decision in favour of ourselves or our enemies in view of enemy activity towards Tabriz-It might perhaps he worth considering a further extension of our levies by the early enlistment of an increased number of Hazaras Infantry at Meshed to assist in any operations which might be conducted in or from Khorasan. There would be no local difficulty, and it could be accomplished without prejudice to recruiting for Indian regiments. That they are valuable material is well known. Afghan authorities are reported to be trying to induce some of the Hazara Chiefs now in Khorasan to return to Afghanistan, possibly to get hold of their followers for military service. 79 Telegram P., No. 522, dated the 8th (received 9th) June 1918.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. I received a message this morning from Sirdar Mohtasham Bakhtiari, the newly-appointed Governor of Ispahan, that he intends to take the first opportunity to pick quarrel with Cossack detachment at Ispahan whom he describes as “ our ” troops that he and his tribesmen would drive them out; that the Illkhani and Illbegi would be powerless to render us any assistance; that he would have the support of whole tribe and that there would be an attack on the oil-fields. I had a visit this afternoon from Sirdar Jang who assure me Mohtasham’s bluster was inspired by Bibi Mariam and Murtiza Kuli Khan and should not be taken seriously, as the tribe would never turn against us. I replied that Mohtasham’s language was the sort of declaration of war one might expected from Soulat, and that considering the forces we had in Mesopotamia, abundantly supplied with aeroplanes, etc., the threat against the oil-fields was childish. This Jang privately recognized fully and said that what Mohtasham really wants is that Cossacks whom he looks on as a force of Zil-es-Sultan should be got rid of. Late Cabinet had told Mohtasham that the Persian Government did not recognize Division and thought he saw a way of bringing pressure to bear on me to ( ? ) it. Jang seems sincere, and his explanation seems correct, but the incident is nevertheless disquieting. I shall be better able to judge of its gravity, when Samsam-es-Sultaneh comes to discuss it to-morrow. The Persian Government though professing to recognize only a brigade not a division of Cossacks have on many occasions asked Bussian Officer Commanding to use both Ispahan and Tabriz detachments on behalf of the Government, e.g., for furnishing guards for Imperial Bank of Persia specie convoys. I was requested by Mushir-e.d-Dowleh early last year to desire bank to apply through Government to officer of Cossacks and not direct. This refers to my telegram No. 515.

Pressure is being brought to bear on Shah by strong party at Court to prevent formation of a Cabinet until issue of German effort in West is cleared up and this consideration seems to be having its effect on some of Vosug’s supporters also. Situation both in Pars and at Tabriz is obviously jeopardized by delay and I am disposed to ask for audience with Shah and request that he shall send personal orders to southern tribes in absence of Cabinet. But any demarche of mine with Shah is attended by consideration that it will be represented as action in Yosug’s favour and will reduce chances of his success considerably. Advent of any other Prime Minister would be even greater evil than renewal of fighting at Shiraz; where Sykes can hold his own for a time presumably. * Addressed Poreign Office, London; repeated Baghdad and Shiraz. 82 Telegram P., No. 50, dated the 9th (received 11th) June 1918.

Kawam who was very perturbed said that it would be impossible for him to maintain his position in safety whatever we might be able to do, unless reinforcements started within a shorter time than two months. After a long conversation with Governor-General however he was persuaded to make his position quite clear as obedient to Persian Government by taking up his residence in Ark.

The Treasury are unwilling to meet the outstanding Russian requisitions in Persia and the Foreign Office is telegraphing to Marling for information as to probable political effect of refusing • Apparently group omtted. this demand,* (Should be) glad cf Duusterville’s views as to whether, and to what extent this refusal to pay will adversely effect the military situation in North-West Persia; also whether there are any military advantages, and, if so, of what nature, to be obtained by paying. The Treasury resources in Persian currency are limited and the demands are ever increasing which must be paid in that currency alone, and I can only press this demand if supported by the strongest arguments. I learn that large quantities of these requisitions have been purchased by speculators, and there seems no reason why they should profit at our expense. It is clear that Baratoff would not be financially affected unless in the event of our refusal he contemplates paying the requisitions himself or is in collusion with the holders. It is certain that all outstanding requisitions will be covered by the 8,000,000 krans mentioned by Hamadan Board. (See Dunsterville’s telegram of May 13th, No. 96 6.) It was stated by Dunsterville in his 99— 7 of May 9th that no accurate estimate of the total value of these requisitions was possible, but be gave the figure as under 10,000,000 krans in his telegram of May 11th, No. 93—5. 87 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7411, dated the 6th June 1918.)

Your 158516 (58516 ?) Cipher, May 11th. A summary of Baratoff’s case (he is now staying here) is as follows:— He contends he is due approximately 13,500,000 krans from January l^th to April 13th, on the basis of his monthly subsidy of 10,400,000 krans.18 He maintains that the cost of evacuation was considerably more than the original estimate of 7,300,000 Krans as this figure was only the difference in the cost of the force when on the move over that when halted; also that to this should be added the maintenance of the troops for three months, this being the period, the evacuation took due to bad roads and distance. His chief of supplies counted on money and provisions which should have -come from Russia and which were never realised, but he hoped to meet requisitions he had been forced to make, and which he states to amount to 8,500,000 krans on receiving his subsidy in full. He maintains that, with the exception of a small sum for billets, this is quite separate from the old debts of the corps. He says he has announced to requisition holders, that the money would be paid after receipt of money from the British. He asks that payment may he spread over a period of from one to three months, and effected by local hanks, after inspection by his staff direct with holders of requisitions. It is averred by him that the anti-British feeling will he converted into one of sympathy by payment. He concludes by saying that, although the sum of 13,500,000 krans is due, he requests 8,500,000 krans to cover requisition be now paid, and that 1,500,000 krans due from Hunsterforce for stores taken over, go as part payment of 8,500,000 krans. Baratoff’s views are represented in the above. In reply to your telegram under reference, you will receive Marling J &amp; political views and Dunsterforce’s military views. I will give Baratoff no indication that money will be paid meanwhile. 88 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7108, dated the 30th May 1918.) Telegram P., No. AJ.

Reference your 39706, May 21st. The following considerations occur to me pending receiving the letters mentioned. It is desirable that the destruction should be carried out as far as possible to the west. There are three methods possible. (1) By Armenian Agency. The Armenians are acutely interested in blockade of Turkish advance. Many of them are now serving with the Bolsheviks, and Turcomans under Armenian officers guard the Trans-Caspian- Persian frontier. At all important places of the line there are branches of their societies. Individuals presumably w 7 ould have expert knowledge. (2) By Turcoman Agency. Though the attitude of majority of them in the event of actual Turkish presence is doubtful, we have evidence that some of them are opposed to Turkish advance. Steps to ascertain attitude appear urgent {vide my M. D.-75, May 21st). (3) By employment of our troops. Apart from other considerations it would be difficult lor them to operate except near Lutfabad where the railway is close to the Persian frontier and it is doubtful if they could make a serious interruption there. Also the point is too far east. It would be necessary to have some experts. (Principally owing to the difficulty of transport of explosive along the line the employment of special agents has not been considered.) The first of the above three alternatives seems to promise the most chance of success as it is probable the capitalists would undertake the task in self- defence if they are directly interested.As the’very thorough damage done to the actual line by the Bokharans was quickly repaired the only effective method seems to be the destruction of bridges and culverts over a wide area. Whatever method may he decided on would he facilitated considerably by our occupation of Kuchan, but it is considered that 100 men would be the minimum necessary in the present condition of that region.

Beference telegram No. 288, June 2nd, from Marling to Foreign Office. I am not aware of Marling’s views regarding political effect of non-payment of Baratoff’s request in full and which, presumably in accordance with your No. (1-5 ?) 8516 of 17th May was communicated to Foreign Office. I gather from Marling’s No. 288 that his opinion is that the effect will be detrimental to our interests. I have informed Baratoff of your decision and he presses for reconsidera tion on the plea that his three years’ residence in the country enables him to foretell the evil consequences of non-payment and doubtless owing to his disappointment it will be made clear that the non-payment is due to us. In m view of Dunsterville’s difficulties and * i change. the apparently genuine (calculation* of) debts which is explained in my X.-8938 of May 21st it is my opinion that situa tion would be materially affected at this juncture by the full payment of the 8| millions krans as suggested through 11 change. the bank of Persia (direct) f to requisition holders after examination by BaratofTs staff. 90 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7576, dated the 10th June 1918.)

Your 59391, June 1st. Dunsterville is now at Kasvin where Bicharakov is under his orders and as soon as one thousand infantry and Armoured Car Squadron arrive so as to hold the Enzeli-Kasvin line, Bicharakov will go to Baku and Aetharhan. The Armoured Car Squadron and later on much troops as can be made available Dunsterville proposes to send with Bicharakov. Dunsterville con siders that this seems to be the best opportunities which have occurred. Eventually he thinks desires to proceed himself to Baku where he thinks it is not too late to move Baku Oil, Khasnovodse Cotton and obtain control of Caspian entirely and he considers that no effect will be obtained by sending only one or two British officers to Baku, that town looks to us for effective support and that there is no need to destroy oil field. I recommend that Dunsterville, in view of reasons given above, be given a free hand as regards sending the British troops he suggests to Baku on the condition that he retains control over them. I request your approval.91 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7501, dated the 8th June 1918.) Telegram P., No. X.-9280, dated the 5th (received 6th) June 1918.

A party under Major Starnes is being sent to Bijar; he will work country towards Takkan Tepe and thence towards Sakis, if favourable.

It has been decided by His Majesty’s Government that, henceforward, Sykes shall be under your orders, and that you will be responsible for the control of operations in his area. This will, if considered essential, include the disbandment of the Pars Brigade, South Persia Rifles.22 2. It has also been decided by His Majesty’s GoYornment that Sykes should forthwith he reinforced by you by two battalions, and such other troops you may consider necessary, via Bandar Abbas. It is considered that, owing to the difficulty of the Bushire-Shiraz route, in view of climatic conditions, and opposition likely to be encountered thereon, no useful purpose will be o (§ served, at present, by the despatch of reinforcements to Bushire. 3. The reinforcements above mentioned in paragraph “ 2” should be found from troops not earmarked for Egypt, as it is essential that troops destined for that special servi ce should be sent as already arranged. There should be no delay in sending reinforcements, in view of the Shiraz situation. 97 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7412, dated the 6th June 1918.)

Wire to Commander-in-Chief in India, Simla, from War Office :— Begins, “ It has been decided by His Majesty’s Government that, henceforward, Sykes shall be under your orders, and that you will be responsible for the control of operations in his area. This will include the disbandment of Ears Brigade, South Bersi a Rifles, if it is considered essential.” Ends, Regarding the last point you should keep me fully informed as to situation and your views. 2. An appreciation of the military situation, as viewed here, is as follows:— (а) Soulat’s influence centres in the district between Shiraz and Bushire where Wassmuss is assisting him. (б) Until order is restored in the Bushire hinterland, the Soulat-cum- Wassmuss hostilities will continue. (c) You should be able to maintain your position until the autumn, and, in the meantime, the views of reinforcements landing at Bushire, combined with preparations for an advance, will make Soulat apprehensive and retain in the Bushire hinterland tribes who would otherwise join him. {d) The movement of the two battalions from Bandar Abbas would have to be carried out by echelons at two to three days’ interval, owing to lack of transport and supplies, and they will scarcely affect the situation till they reach ISaidabad, 16 marches from Bandar Abbas. (e) Even postulating the arrival of these battalions by August 15th at Shiraz, you will then have to advance against Soulat without any assistance from Bushire. By now preparing at Bushire, on the other hand, October 1st should see us ready to land additional troops at Bushire sufficient to advance on Kazerun, thus placing the Soulat between two fires. (/) Bandar Abbas is a worse base than Bushire climatically, and as regards facilities. 3. It is proposed by the Commander-in-Chief therefore— (a) To reinl'orce Bushire now with two battalions; to make a light tramway to Daliki and to prepare to advance on Kazerun, °by early autumn, with a mixed bridge. (5) To send at once via Bandar Abbas about 600 infantry drafts and reinforeement of two squadrons of cavalry.-fi IIWBBSSWiBi MM I 23 4. Your military appreciation of the situation with any remarks on ours above should be wired, and also details of your arrangements for main taining your position at Shiraz, indicating locality of defensive post, and other relevant factors, including the withdrawal of weak or isolated detach ments. 5. With reference to your telegram of June 3rd, No. 179—61-G., we should be able to place greater reliance on your views, if it was obvious there from that calculation of time and space had been carefully made. In this case, such calculations would have shown you that no force could be in readiness to advance from Bushire in a week. The present orders for the reinforcement of Bushire are as follows :— 1 battalion embarks at Karachi, June 7th. &gt;} „ Bombay, June 8th. 6. No seaplanes are known to be in Indian waters. Bushire has had orders to prepare an aerodrome for aeroplanes, and so as to be ready in case aeroplanes can be made available a question now under consideration, you should prepare one as well. 98 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7427, dated the 6th June 1918.)

Keference your 179—61-G., dated 3rd June. Information we have up to date is that local Khans, knowing that reinforcements are arriving, are afraid of attack from Bushire. No men from Daliki or Borasjun or elsewhere in this neighbourhood have join(ed) Soulat, but it is reported that 8,000 cartridges have been sent under escort of brother of Daliki. . 99 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7412, dated the 6th June 1918.)

Clear line. There is no great change in the situation. Soulat expected simultaneous outbreaks in Shiraz, Deh and Niriz and is disappointed these places still remain quiet. He has a large • i change. force near (round?*) Khaneh Khabis, and has warned (townj ?)s people he will attack shortly in which case we will fio&gt;ht him. Wassmuss is reported to be with Soulat. It is difficult to foresee events, but Soulat’s tribesmen, especially Kazerun men, are truculent. 100 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7427, dated the 6th June 1918.)

Staff agree with the following remarks which I offer :— (1) Last point—Disbandment of Pars South Persia Rifles at present not advisable. This could be done at Shiraz, but this would precipitate matters and have untoward effects on Kerman Brigade and at Niriz, Abadeh and Dehbid,24 (2) (a) Soulat’s influence extends northward around Dehbid, Abadeh, Qumisheb, the Kashgais summer habitats. (c) Bushire hinterland contingents (apparently* ?) in Soulat’s camp and situation here will not be appreciably • i change. affected by mere bluff combined with inaction at Bushire. (d) Force recommended via Bandar Abbas to Saidabad is primarily to hold Saidabad, protection of supplies and munitions now there and ensure safety of Kerman province. Kawam admits that if Soulat invests us at Shiraz the bulk of Arab tribes will (turnf) against t Omission. '^^ith Arabs against us South Persia Rifles, Kerman, cannot be relied on without more adequate support of Indian troops, and trouble would spread eastward from Kerman province. Arab trouble would be checked and future disturbances possibly confined to Pars, if Saidabad were made stronger. (e) It is not contemplated that reinforcements arriving Saidabad be utilised to strengthen us at Shiraz in present circumstances. (3) (6) Infantry drafts for Shiraz are not likely to find (roadj) open : Omitted. beyond Saidabad. (5) It was inferred from your 41711 of 28th May that two battalions were then on their way to Bushire and it was presumed that Basrah was being drawn on in emergency. Here the emergency appeared a real one and to us does not seem to have lessened. (6) Will do our best to construct aerodrome in Consulate Avenue. The following is appreciation to-day :— Soulat at Khaneh Zebis —from Eerozabad 30 mule loads of ammunition, 800 camel loads of supplies and reinforcements, bringing his total to 9,600. This total is estimated by the number of sacks of atta he issued per 25 men, and the report, which is reliable, confirms previous reports. Kazerunis at Khaneh Zinian are additional. As result of fanatical and German propaganda, Ears generally is hostile towards British, and in Kerman province there is anti-British propaganda also. Without help from outside the tndian garrison at Shiraz will be invested, and we are making all arrangements to hold out until the autumn. The bulk of the Arab tribes are likely to join against us in the near future and South Persia Rifles, Ears Brigade will proDably desert or revolt. Kerman Brigade will be in danger, and the only trustworthy troops there are the wing of Indian Infantry at Saidabad. To save Kerman province from disorder, Indian reinforcements should be sent as quickly as convenient and the bare minimum advocated for Saidabad is— 1 Mountain Battery. 2 Squadrons Cavalry. 1 Battalion Indian Infantry. Indian troops at Shiraz are concentrated in group of continuous walled gardens ch ar from west side of Shiraz with good field of fire all round. W ells in gardens. Supplies, Munition Consulate and hospitals in centre. The adjacent gardens and buildings in which South Persia Rifies °*uns have been parked, are occupied by British Ranks, Ears Brigade. 101 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7499, dated the 8th June 1918.)

From—1 he General Officer Commanding, Bushire, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Yesterday I had a friendly interview of an unofficial nature with Darya Begi who is well acquainted with Shiraz politics and the situation was freely- discussed apparently with some sincerity. Darya Begi doubts the good faith of Kawam who, he thinks, could control the Arab tribes if he wished to do so. He says that Soulat will find difficulty in raising a large following amongst the Kashgais j and unless he can pay them well he cannot in any case retain them long, and he will not do this with his own money* He repeatedly emphasised that unless the British Government take strong action there is every chance of the situation becoming dangerous though he does not, in fact, consider it so at present. He strongly urged an immediate move from here which, he considers, would be sufficient to‘cause Soulat’s present efforts to collapse and he offered to co-operate with this. As he is anxious for the punishment of the chiefs who have defied his authority and probably anticipates considerable pecuniary advantage to himself from such a move, he is not, in the latter case, wholly disinterested. 103 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7577, dated the 10th June 1918.)

Operations. 1. following is military situation regarding Shiraz, on latest information :— (а) It is reported that Soulat is proposing negotiations j this may indicate apprehension on his part. Action by him may be precipitated by his supply and money difficulties which limit his ability to keep his concentration together; latest report places some of his forces 16 miles south-west from Shiraz. (б) His apprehensions will possibly be increased by the arrival of re inforcements notified you in my 41716, May 28th, which are due at Bushire on 10th and 13th June. According to a Bushire report the news of reinforce ments has prevented men leaving Daliki or Borasjun to join Soulat. (c) Beinforcements arriving at Bandar Abbas will have similar effect. Following is the order of their arrival;— 1 Squadron each, 26th and 27th Light Cavalry, June 30th. 1 Company 120th Infantry, 200 rifles, 16th Bajputs, 3 sections I. F. A.,’ June 23rd. These will be followed in a few days by another company Indian Infantry and one section Indian Mountain Battery.'T-rs 26 2. In communicating to Sykes the decision of His Majesty’s Govern ment that he would be under my orders, I gave him my views, as expressed to you in my 43369, June 3rd, and asked for his. On June 6th, he replied generally as follows. My comments in each case, are appended— (a) Not considered advisable at present to disband Pars Brigade South Persia BifleS as it would precipitate matters and have untoward effects on Kerman Brigade and at Niriz, Abadeh and Dehbid. I agree with this. (i) He considers situation will not he affected by more demonstration at Bushire and asks for advance inland within a week, a proposal which, he has been informed, is not practicable. The fact of Sykes making such a proposal shews that he does not realise the time and effort necessary to equip and assemble the force necessary for such an operation. (c) Porce recommended by him via Bandar Abbas to Saidabad, viz., 2 squadrons cavalry, one battalion infantry and one mountain battery, is pri marily to hold Saidabad, protect munitions and supplies now there and ensure safety of Kerman province. It is admitted by Kawam that bulk of Arab tribes will turn against us if Soulat invests us at Shiraz. With Arabs against us, the South Persia Bifles, Kerman, cannot be relied on without more adequate support of Indian troops and trouble would spread eastward from Kerman province. If Saidabad were made stronger, Arab trouble would be checked and future disturbances possibly confined to Pars. Sykes continues that, in present circumstances, it is not contemplated that reinforcements arriving Saidabad be utilized to strengthen us at Shiraz. My comment is that, this is the first mention, Sykes has made of Saidabad as the limit of this operation. Prom paragraph 1 above it will be seen that I am increasing the reinforcements for Bandar Abbas by two mountain guns and one company infantry. 3. Sykes is rightly preparing to meet an investment, but generally I do not think he realises the effect on the Sou]at of his defeat on the 25th ; while reports from Bushire do not corroborate Sykes’ views regarding the extent of the rising, which is considered by Bushire to be much more local. 4. Viceroy’s telegram of June 6th to Secretary of State gives the views ?o Secretary, War office, only. of the Government of India on the Shiraz question. 104 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7577, dated the 10th June 1918.)

(б) Begarding a possible successor to Soulat as Illkbani of Kashgais. {c) Puture organisation and status of South Persia Bifles. Without any consultation and without my know ledge these negotiations are being carried on and this procedure is not satisfactory from my point of view- As I* am responsible for the safety of my troops and for military operations, I lay these facts before you, and would request that some solution is given to ensure that military and political measures are not run in water tight compartments.

To this extent that the Mullahs and democrats in Shiraz appear somewhat * ed by storm raised, the situation is easier, to-day South Persia Rifles troops have been used in reconnaissance with Indian troops. Soulat force and Kazerunis remain as before and main issue still is whether Soulat will venture into the Shiraz valley or venture other movement, of an offensive nature such as raiding roads or general raiding. Many people are working in plot against us and every precaution is being taken. I am not being kept fully informed of the political situation nor of the political measures being taken at Tehran, which include such vital matters as certain terms and proposals which I understand have been put forward by Soulat, and I do not feel that, as regards the local military position at this juncture I, have that knowledge and control which it demands. 106 Telegram P., No. 51, dated the 10th (received 12th) June 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla,. A notice has been published by Kawam to his followers in Shiraz saying that he and his family have always been loyal to Persian Government who have now begged him to do his best to prevent Soulat fighting the English with whom Persia is in as friendly relations as ever. As it appears that his efforts to induce Soulat to keep the peace have failed, the Kawam announces that he has decided that it is bis duty to remain neutral, but at the same time to guard the safety of town against aggression and to defend his own properties, and that he will therefore certainly fight against any attack on Shiraz with all his force. His people are called on to decide if they will support him in this policy which has Governor-GeneraPs approval, while any of his men who decide that they cannot follow him should go now in peace. If on the other hand they decide to support him, they should swear him a solemn oath. As they have all done so, I trust the effect will be an early arhelioratioa of the situation. This result is due to efforts of Governor-General who has worked unceas ingly and who has again placed us under an obligation.

I understood early in March that we were to despatch sufficient force to North- West Persia with a view principally of stabilising Tehran situation and preventing ingress of enemy agents, but later also of keeping open the Caucasus road. But these operations were side-tracked to permit Marshall advancing to Altun Keupri, whence he is now withdrawing to Aksu line. Though these operations entailed delay in advance on Hamadan and although I specially pointed out necessity of carrying out operations quickly and unhesitatingly once it was decided to send troops to Persia, I received (no ? ) intimation of this. We are now making efforts to send on troops, but even so the proposed force is inadequate and is to be eked out by local levies whose value is not reassuring judged by our experience with the South Persia Rifles at Shiraz. I am now informed of the countermanding of Dunsterville’s mission just when it has better chance, so far as my information goes, of achieving some thing than ever before, and when it seems most necessary to take any risk to secure Baku. Should Baku and later Rrasnovodsk fall to the enemy, only2 the British occupation of Tehran or effective resumption of the war by Russia could prevent Persia falling completely under the influence of the enemy. May I, therefore, be informed as soon as possible what other means His Majesty’s Government contemplate to meet enemy efforts in these regions, so that my own endeavours here may conform to them ? An alliance which would cover the Shiraz situation also is the only effective means that I can see.

From-—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Consuls at Tabriz with whom French Minister and I have had tele* graph conversation, consider situation dangerous and propose to send away remainder of colonies as soon as possible, and we have authorised Consuls to accompany them, as we see no useful purpose in leaving our Consuls to be captured if the Turks enter the town. The Prime Minister,, whom I saw subsequently, is much less apprehensive than the Consuls of the Turks entering Tabriz, but said that Vali Ahd and Governor-General would leave, if they did. A decision had not been reached on question of resisting Turks, and it is improbable that Persia will take so decided a step. Although four Ministers have definitely resigned the Cabinet lingers on and Prime Minister would say nothing on the reconstruction or resignation.

Apparently they are determined to carry on Government with little regard to His Majesty, and absolutely confident of success. This mormng Vossugh-ed-Dowleh confirmed this to me himself. He declared that the corner stone of his policy was close relations with us, adding- that he would be willing to take such an attitude towards Turks as would lead to a rupture ot relations. Should this pave the way to an alliance with us, Persian public opinion would demand something, aD( j ]j e thought territorial acquisition in Kurdistan would appeal to the national vanity. At present he declined to say anything more definite, hut I think he wanted something else. ° The South Persia Rifles is the great stumbling block and fie thought the only possible solution was the return of the best of the Swedes, Folcke for example.

Continuation my X.-8938 of 21st. Dunsterville’s Q.-48, 22nd May:— Begins. Reference D. M. I. 58516, May 17th. Payment of Russian requisitions is more a political issue. I cannot state any actual military advantage is to be obtained by such payment to abstain from payment is to increase growth of Russian attitude of mistrust and jealousy. I advocate it as a desirable measure but as a claim Russians have no ground to stand on speculators will be eliminated if payment is made through bank payment being refused except to actual individuals holding requisitions orders. Before payment Russians can now produce statement showing total required which is less than 10 and more than 8 million Krans. Ends. Baratoff maintains that by handing over stores to Dunsterville he acted the part of friendly ally as he could have sold them to Persians for good price. He still urges his case for payment of 8J million Krans and urges further that even if 8J millions are not paid the millions due for stores should be paid as in handing them over he thought he would get paid in cash and thus pay for the outstanding billet requisitions which are not part of evacuation expenses but are part of old debt. He suggests that banks should be the medium for meeting claims of holders of requisition. 8 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6983, dated the 28th May 1918.)

Dunsterville’s Q.-28, May 20th Begins. Though War Office considers original estimate for maintenance of Bicharakov’s force excessive, it is far exceeded by the cost. Payment he is now receiving from me is at the rate ofWPj H——^ —mil il &lt; 4 something under 4,000,000 Krans monthly. Exact amount cannot be stated owing to fluctuation of cost of supplies. The above represents literal cost of maintenance. Bicharakov does not ask and will not accept any money in the nature of a reward and it is not suggested that any sum of such a nature shall paid him. Expenditure is supervised by Clutterbuck and I have o-o ne into every detail with him and Bicharakov. The cost is less than that of putting a British Eorce into his place. His troops are invaluable and he has no intention of leaving us in the lurch unless we deal unfairly with him. The above figures represent cost only of maintaining Troops Transport Line of Communication, Wireless and Hospitals and they must be accepted as they stand or Bicbarakov must be told that his services are dispensed with. Our own forces available for the large schemes I have to deal with are absolutely the minimum, but I can make much out of them working whole heartedly with Bicharakov. Dispersal of Bicharakov’s force will limit my sphere of activity considerably. JZnds. 9 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6978, dated the 28th May 1918.) Telegram P., No. M.

Endeavours are being made to obtain further information regarding them, and which will be telegraphed later. It seems the present j Corrupt effort of ...f is directed to composing traditional quarrels amongst local chiefs and detaching pro-British element. It appears they have had some success with the Khans of Shabankarah and Erdale (?) and they are now trying to bring about an agreement between Angali and Chahkutah. It seems more probable they will try to form a combination for an attack on Bushire in concert with the movement of Soulat, rather than advocate direct support of latter.

Otherwise, it would be sufficient to hold it in readiness at Basrah. B. Have asked Medical, Bandar Abbas, to telegraph his opinion on the position direct to you, but, I think at least half battalion should be sent there at once owing to general untrustworthiness of the South Persia Bides, and the amount of stores there. 20 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7003, dated the 29th May 1918.)

Having especially in view the fact that I have to extend my right flank to the Caspian, I am very much averse to any further dissipation of the force under my command. 2. From the time order to move was given, it would take 2 infantry brigades with such pack transport as could be made available 3 weeks to reach Basrah. Onward move would be dependent on shipping. 3. As regards pack transport. It is calculated that 2 infantry brigades carrying 14 days’ supplies exclusive of fodder and fuel would require 10,900 mules, and this makes no provision for extra water that would be needed. The only mules that could be made available would be 2,000 which constitute total reserves in the country and 1,554 by converting all transport of 2 infantry brigades from draught to pack. Making total of 3,554 pack mules as against 10,900 that would be required. 4. As regards aeroplanes. Distance of flight from Basra to Bushire follow ing the coast is 250 miles. This is too far for machines especially in view of hot weather and liability of engines to over heat. If sent aeroplanes would have to be packed and shipped from Baghdad. As regards landing grounds at Bushire and Shiraz I have no information, but I doubt feasibility of making aerodrome at Shiraz as aeroplanes spares cannot be carried on pack transport. B. E. type of machines are reported more suitable in summer heat than those in this force. If you have any of the former machines they would Probably be safer. 21 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7003, dated the 29th May 1918.) Telegram P., No. 1294-B.

Considerable proportion of South Persia Rides is without doubt affected and remainder frightened.

On the other hand, Soulat s defeat and flight may hearten his enemies^ and weaken his position as ■it- j* ./oa , Illkhani(?)|| and so improve matters. Kadiaj(P) people are very hostile and undoubtedly worked up by Wassmuss In my opinion and that of my staff, situation at Shiraz at present would make it very risky to despatch any offensive column, composed of bulk of Indian troops, beyond a radius of 5 or 6 miles.

A much less regular hut more comprehen sive scheme is required. The immediate purpose in hand is to get as much as possible of the country intervening between the Turks and us into our hands and to overrun that area with our influence rather than theirs. Regular cavalry and infantry training appears unnecessary for this purpose. With the large number of officers available and adequate arrangements for regular payment it should be possible to raise considerably larger numbers than Dunsterville contemplates. It is of great importance that organisation arrangement should he pushed forward with the utmost rapidity over an area extending as far as is practicable to the north of Kasvin-Kermanshah road. 39 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 7118, dated the 30th May 1918.)

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Both Barman Farma and Kawam have received letters from Soulat who has also sent in a telegram for Persian Government. Soulat asserts in all three that the Kashgais have not been the aggressors and that he obeyed the orders of Governor-General to prevent his tribes getting oat of hand even when we struck the Darashuris. It was for that purpose that he came to Khaneh Khabis, where the Indian troops again attacked him. Though his tribes are now gathered to defend themselves and their honour he assures Persian Government that if the Minister will give a satisfactory assurance that in future the tribes will not be interfered with in any way either by British troops or by South Persia Bifles, he himself will give a satisfactory assurance that he will keep his tribes in order and safeguard the roads which pass through his territory. Stress is laid on the fact that he was not the aggressor even though the South Persia Rifles were not recognised by Persian Government. He wifi keep his tribes quiet until an answer comes from Persian Government provided we on our side make no hostile move. r He knows of reinforcements coming up, hut professes he is ready to fight it out to the end. His own reinforcements have come in from south and he expects (others ?). I have consulted with Governor-General and Kawam, and I am convinced that the courses open to us are these three only—— (1) A forward movement made from Bushire within a week or ten davs agamst (group undecypherable) and close to that place, would have immediate effect of drawing off all the Dashti and Hashtistan men from Soulat and would have a very strong effect on his own tribesmen also. Unless this stroke is made however and followed up within a very short time by a forward move ment towards Shiraz at an early date, it will not fulfil its object. Governor- General can keep Soulat in play for ten days or so and keep him from making a move against us. But it is not likely that Soulat will wait much longer as he will be finding difficulty m feeding his men and keeping them together! ( 2 ) We can sit tight m our entrenchments and defy attack, and awai t reinforcements from Bandar Abbas and Bushire, But this would certainlv encourage the townspeople, Arabs and uhole country to go against us • roads vould be cut; supplies would be cut off, and our prestige gone for ever/ WeCan f CCept .

I have the honour to forward herewith, for information, a copy of a letter • Vide last paragraph on page 2 of Gulf Summary Written by 0U6 Seyyid Muhammad* for Apni 1917 . tt D oc t;or ” and signed by Wassmuss, which has been communicated to me under seal of the greatest secrecy by Nasrulla Khan Buwair Ahmadi. It was handed to him in Bushire by an unknown Seyyid, who promised to return for an answer, but evidently considered it more prudent not to do so, in view of the evident closeness of our relations with Nasrulla Khan. It is a good illustration of the character of Wassmuss* continued activities against us in this region. As long as these continue unhindered, it is impossible to expect these Khans either to believe that our military situation is satisfactory, or to adopt any tone towards us but that of contemptuous equality, which renders any settlement with them impossible. I hope that the news of Nasrulla Khan’s hospitality to Mr. Chick and myself, and our cordial reception by all classes at Behbahan, may have convinced Wassmuss that the soil of that region at least is unfruitful for bis intrigues. « Translation of a letter from Wassmuss, Abram, to Nasrulla Khan and Muzafferullah Khau, Kalantars of the Buwair Ahmadi Kuhgelu. I trust that you are in the best of health and happiness. Por a long time past, for an age, I have been without news of your welfare : I trust that you are ever happy and well. Now that a means has come to hand I have not let slip the opportunity for expressing my friendliness, asking after your health, and enquiring as to the course of events in those regions, in the hope that in your reply you will please and rejoice me with the news of your welfare. Should you ask after me, thank God I still enjoy the blessing of health. Should you desire to know the state of affairs in these parts, no change has occurred : just as before I am sitting here opposing the British, and I do not permit that the British should acquire any influence here. That is to say, Their Honours Zair Khidhar Khan, Amir al Islam, Tangistani, and Sheikh Hussein Khan, Salar al Islam, Chahkutahi, and Ghazanfar as Saltaneh, Borasjuni, and the Chiefs of Dashti are allied with one another to thrust back the British with one accord, should the British make any forward movement here. Similarly, His Honour Nasir-i-Diwan, Zargham-i-Islam, in Kazerun is steadfastly opposing any advance of the British there. I greatly desire to be informed of the machinations of the British in the Kuhgelu region, and of the state of affairs there. I beg you will acquaint me with your welfare and the state of affairs by that old man with one arm, or by some other Qasid. If you would like to hear the news, of course you are aware of the complete defeat of the British in Prance, which will probably soon finish the business. But alas ! on the other hand, as the British see the Persian Government helpless, they are busy seizing the whole of Persia, and in most places they have attained their object, which is to set Persians against one another.i 16 However in the end the Government in Tehran became aware of this, and cut off its relations with the British Minister, and issued an ultimatum to the British that they must leave Persia together with their troops. In the north of Persia Mirza Kuchik Khan, Jangali, has captured the British Consul and Bank Manager at Resht, and seized the Bank. Their . co mm unications in the north have been cut. It would be well if you also in the south would assist the Government and people, and take any steps possible against the British, so that they may be compelled to leave Persia. I eagerly await an answer from you, and hope that our ancient friendly relations will not cease. May the days of happiness endure. Your friend, Wassmuss.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Though Prime Minister is friendly disposed, there is a strongish hostile clement in Cabinet whose opposition his rather passive supporters do not care to face. Hence he is unable to give effect to the promises to show a friendly disposition to British interests throughout the country which he made me jbefore taking office. He has been given by me to understand that I cannot obtain your sanction to the Persian Government being given any measure of financial support until he has sent a circular to provinces prescribing such attitude to local authorities. It is unlikely that his resignation can be deferred long failing such support and in view of general disbelief in Cabinet’s capacity to improve matters or deal with famine. The only possible successor appears to be Yossough-ed-Dowleb whose early accession to power is regarded as inevitable by most people. While it would be hardly correct to say that he has a party, he is supported by various groups and the feeling that he is the only man for situation is wide spread. Though he has hitherto preferred to wait until the situation was made easier by the advance of our aviators and approach of harvest, he seems to be l ready to accept office. It must be admitted that the anti-British propaganda countenanced and, since June last, actively promoted by Persian Government, has had consider able effect amongst the comparatively small proportion of the people interested in politics, and with certain tribal chiefs. The great mass of the nation however remains indifferent; the commercial classes are friendly recognising that our influence makes for peace and order. German propaganda is not in my opinion making any considerable head way, though German agents are multiplying and already gaining adherents by spending money. The real Germanophil or Turcophil party is very small none the less. It is well understood by Yossough-ed-Dowleh that Persia’s interests demand the most friendly relations with us and I think that he is ready to come to an arrangement on the basis of my note of March 11th (see your telegram No. 132, March 7th, and my despatch No. 20, March 14th). I doubt, how ever whether he will be.able to get a Cabinet which will give him free hand together. We shall be able to get on well with him, I believe.4 It is difficult to guage the importance of the Jangali movement. It seems to be losing ground at Kesht. Towards Mazanderan and further East it is extending its activities. Both the Shah and the present Prime Minister are hostile to it, but the present Cabinet have no means whereby to deal with it. Vossough-ed-Dowleh will probably find means to counteract it when ta comes into office.

Bandar Abbas reports that Kohistanis have formed a league with the Arab tribes to attack British posts where possible, and to murder Qawam. It appears from many sources that Soulet is against the British and is anxious to engage in hostilities and, although he has tried hard to win Qawam over, it appears that he has failed. It is reported by Legation that the officers of the South Persia Bifles have been giving information to the Kashgais in order to enable them to rob caravans. Again, the arrival of large numbers of German and Turkish officers at Tehran is sure to create an unfavourable reaction on the position in Pars. The execution of deserters has produced excellent results and, by striking blows where necessary, it is confidently expected that the position can be maintained. 221 Telegram P., No. 102, dated (and received) the 18th May 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorasan, Meshed, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (sent to Tehran). I have had conversation with Governor-General, as a sequel to my requests for ti e delivery of 26 escaped enemy prisoners and assistance in procuring sowars for levies; (and for the ?) arrest of democrat inspector from Tehran who was reported to he holding pro-Turk meetings in his house. Governor-General repeated the assurances to work for us that he had made in Tehran. He added, however, that in his own interests it must he in some respects secret. Two sclutions of prisoner question were pressed on me : (1) that they should be despatched to Tehran as already ordered by Persian Government and then captured by us at a short distance from Meshed, and (2) that they and any other further prisoners should he interned in a specially prepared place, in guarding which our troops would play unofficial part. His replies to my other requests were satisfactory. In addition to the democrat inspector he has ordered arrest of one of the three mentioned in my telegram No. 74 of April 19th. These he will deport. He then proposed that His Majesty’s Government should be moved to present him in return for a whole hearted devotion to us with 1,000 rifles and 50,000 to 100,000 tomans. With this assistance he could, he said, organise a force of 1,000 men to re-establish order in tie province, and to deal with all prisoners captuie^ and interned and all enemy agents and pro-enemy Persians found in Xhorasan. I expressed my sympathy with the condition in which his predecessor had left Khorasan and promised to reler his requests, but added that even if His Majesty’s Government were able to give him even part of what he wanted, they w*ould certainly request more satisfactory conditions in return. He begged me to enquire upon what conditions could be given help if at all and to what extent. He has courage and of his good intentions I am convinced. A camp for interned prisoners here under the eye of British troops would not be a bad arrangement provided that we are not to take the prisoners over. The Russians however formerly obtained delivery of prisoners, and our first condition should perhaps he the delivery of all such ior internment in India.6 222 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6506, dated the 17th May 1918.)

From— His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Bunsterville who has just been here on a two days’ visit, tells me that so far we have actually despatched for military operations in North-West Persia one platoon of infantry at Kermanshah, another at Hamadan, a squadron of cavalry close to Kasvin, two light armoured motor cars at Kermanshah and two others at Kasvin. Then there are the members of punsteryille force destined for Caucasus, as well as a considerable number of Native levies in process of raising, while four more platoons for Kermanshah are reported on the way. Our political situation here hinges entirely on the military action that has been announced to Persia. Hence i endeavoured to elicit from Dunsterville what troops are to be sent and when. So far from his reply being reassuring, it seems that our operations towards Altum Kupri are making it so difficult to find sufficient transport for Persia as seriously to retard arrival of troops at Hamadan. Moreover it seems indicated by other small facts that operations in North-West Persia as compared with those across frontier have been treated now as quite a minor consideration. Doubless these trans-frontier operations have been decided on for adequate reasons; I would point out however that objects of the Persian operations, viz., intercepting enemy agents, keeping open road to Baku and estabilising position in Tehran cannot be secured by them within any useful time. To me these objects seem now more necessary than ever, and 1 earnestly hope instructions will be given that such troops as Dunstervilie may consider adequate may be despatched with all possible speed. May as exact information as possible as to what measures will be taken be given me ? - Your telegram No. B.-262, dated 10th May. with reference to his telegram May 18th, 37536).

Bnd*y 2288 Position here will become yery difficult unless troops arrive speedily Hitherto had condition of road owing to rain has been my explanation for the delay in arrival of our troops. This however can serve as an excuse no longer and I must be able to reassure Vassuk-ed-Howleh and our friends. They are already uneasy at the delay and would be dismayed if they knew real facts &gt; regarding the present strength of our forces. As it is, considerable secret service expenditure may, I fear, be necessary and till arrival of our troops at Kasvin it is of course essential to retail Bicharakoff’s force.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Fall of Cabinet seems imminent already two Ministers have resigned. Vassuk-ed-Dowleh whom I saw yesterday, said that he was ready to take office with a strongly Anglophil policy at once, and that therefore he would not be able to come to an immediate agreement with us on the lines of my note of March 11th. See my telegram No. 206 the/nclusion Firuz Mirza' A and Kawam-ed-Dowleh in his Cabinejwould be guarantee for the carrying out L of this policy. I said that so far from seeing any reason for delay, I ur^ed him to take the bold course at once while at the height of his popularity He replied that the Shah was a great difficulty and that public opinion would expect quid pro quo of a kind to strike the popular imagination in return for definitely committing Persia to Entente^ Powers. His indications of the con cessions required were extravagant. I enlarged on the extent of the con cessions already tendered and said that I could not see why we should offer further inducement to Persia to follow a policy which His Highness himself regarded as in own interests, and he remarked that he counted on this fact to turn public feeling in our favour. He then said that he could do nothing without an immediate supply of money and asked whether we could support him financially on this basis. After remarking that his platform was exactly the same as Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s, I said that such was my confidence in his ability to act up to his professions/ I should strongly urge His Majesty’s Gov ernment to accord him that support. I added however that we couffi not of course make a definite agreement which might bind us to support any Cabinet of the future. J No other course seems indeed open. Unfriendly as they were I have done my best to keep afloat the last two Cabinets so that Vassuk-ed-Dowleh who is almost the only string to our bow should not come into office until the situation changed with the arrival of our troops at Hamadan and the approach ‘ of new harvest about the end of this month. Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s feeble incapacity unfortunately has so disgusted his own colleagues that his fall is being precipitated audit is now Vassuk-ed-Dowleh or nothin^ Our troops are still a negligible quantity so far as establishing position in Tehran is con cerned and there is nothing for it but to give money freely; our own ^eat gun cannot be allowed to come into action without powder * Hence I surest that we give to Vassuk-ed-Dowleh immediately on his accession to office following support:— xcl a^g 8 ^* thousand pounds a month moratorium at fifty-five Secondly, our share of moratorium instalment spread over next year, providing further fifteen fifty-five exchange. unpaid since last May but thousand monthly also at Thirdly, hundred thousand tomans subsidy.Of these one and two will be in nature of advances, and three Will be discontinued a few months hence. Vassuk-ed-Dowleh would be asked ifi return to give same measure of recognition to South Persia Rifles immediately as when he was last in office, to cease all protest against action 6f ou* trOops and to send instructions to ail local authorities to show friendly attitude to all British interests. In these circumstances I shall be glad to receive authority to furnish these sums on the stated conditions. This refers to my telegram No. 411.

His Majesty's Consul at Tabriz has been informed by GoVernor-GenerM Azerbaijan, that he and democrats desire to organise forced, financed aftd armed by us and officered by Russian to oppose Turkish advance on Tabriz. In reply the Consul said that they must first settle Jelti question or the ’force might be used to attack them and Armenians. In this the Governor-General concurred, as also in the suggestion that British officers, who could go as Secretaries to Consulate, would be necessary to help in organisation. The Governor-General’s proposal would certainly be rejected °by the present Cabinet. According to the Consul it is reported by Armenians at Julfa* that Turks have arrived at Alexandropol and have demanded use of railway to attack British. This definitely cuts wireless to Tiflis.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. y Governor-General has received letter from Soulat intimating that unless they receive orders from Persian Government to remain quiet tinder attacks of “ foreign ” troops South Persia Rifles included all South Persia tribes, Kashgais in particular will shed last drop of blood in defence of their rights against foreigners. He adds that he has transmitted orders of Governor- General to hold in his tribes but he can do so no longer. He has telegraphed to Persian Government and written to the local Mullahs here in the same sense appealing to sense of religion. The whole thing which amounts to a call to jehad is a decided step at last on Soulat’s part. I fear and the fear is also entertained by the Governor-General is that call may possibly appeal to the Arabs, but my present belief is that Kawam who will undoubtedly be pressed will see that his advantage would not lie in joining hands with Soulat. Governor-General and I are of opinion that not only is immediate action to be avoided bnt delay will calm passionate feelings which recent late events have aroused. But while things may settle down it is wise to realise gravity of situation. ^ I am to-day discussing possible eventualities with military authorities and military point of view will be presented to you hereafter.In the case of combination of Kashgais under Soulat I believe Governor- General and I could cause dissensions among them and possibly raise various sections against Soulat. I still regard the value of South Persia Rifles as somewhat doubtful. This refers to Sykes* telegram 292—11-G. of May 15th. 232 f Telegram P., No. 30, dated the 20th (received 21st) May 1918, From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, Xo The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I regard situation as direct result of intrigues of late Cabinet and of Wassmuss now believe to be at Kazerun. Tribes have been made nervous by recent activities of troops and encounter between South Persia Rifles and Kashgais at Khaneh Zinian is spark. It is feared by Governor-General that Arabs who have recently been punished will join Kasbgais who will almost certainly start hostilities in a few days. He is however working to detach merchants and Mullahs, thus robbing the movement of the national and religious tone which Soulat is trying to give it. Kawam is perfectly sound and can hold most of his Arabs. Sykes has been requested by me to avoid provocative action and he has agreed. Counter measures will however be taken, if tribes attack. I have advised him that outposts and lines of communication will probably be attacked. Hostilities would probably be averted by early orders to Soulat from the Cabinet. Kashgais are not in the least likely to attack Shiraz in any case. This is with reference to my telegram No. 78. 233 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6631, dated the 20th May 1918.)

It is considered by Par man Parma and Consul that the present situation is likely to develop into a favourable opportunity for settlement of the Souiat question by stopping Qashqai migration. Soulat has bitter enemies and only about half of the Qashqai tribes side with him. 234 (Received with Army Department memoraudum No. 6631, dated the 20th May 1918.)

Polio wing a night march, the Burma Mounted Rifles surprised and disarmed on the morning of May iOth an encampment of Labu Muhammadi at Burn 20 miles west of Herati, pushing on subsequently to Cbinaonar Headquarters of camp of SahamAshair was attacked by one squadron under Dyer 15 Arabs being killed, 15 wounded and the correspondence of Saham Ashair being captured. Other squadron under Grant attacked camp of Charrahi raiders returning from a looting expedition Yezd road. The squadron under Dyer joined shortly after wards in persuit of Charrahi who lost 15 killed and 21 wounded ; 2 men of the Burma Mounted Rifles were slightly wounded. Over 500 live-stock were re covered from raiders. Burma Mounted Rifles camped at Chinaonar on night 10-llth and on May 11th marched to Herati Khurreh being attacked on the way be a large gathering of Labu Muhammadi Arabs in a pass. Enemy were driven off with a loss of 67 killed and about 40 wounded. 500 more sheep were captured. One man of the Burma Mounted Rifles was killed and one slightly wounded. In the meantime the remainder of the column had marched direct on Herati Khurreh from Chah Haq and the main fort belonging to Haji Baba was taken and destroyed. Haji Baba last year gave asylum to Obeidulla. Grant’s column is proceeding to Saadatabadma the Sarchahan valley being due at Saadatabad on May 19th, and due at Shiraz on about May 23rd. The pesti lential robbers of Herati Khurreh will probably cease from troubling the Yazd- Anar road of the South Persia Rifles lines of communication. The Burma Mounted Rifles have as usua l displayed excellent marching and fighting qualities. - 235 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6635, dated the 20th May 1918.)

On April 27th the section was accordingly placed at his disposal but Bakhtiari expedition has not started yet. The scarcity of supplies and illness of Sirdar Eateh who was in charge of concentration, have been the causes of delay in the assembly of Bakhtiari Forces. On May 15th it was reported by the General Officer Com manding Karun Front that Sirdar Zaffar himself has now gone to collect hi* troops and it is hoped that the expedition may be ready shortly.

Two junior Khans understood to have been sent from Illkhani to Behbahan, so that Kubgelus will not be checked. If strong action has not been taken against them, Bakhtiari road will shortly be (rendered unsafe. Kuhgelus raids may assume greater proportion this year than usual. This is general opinion in country and is due to increased strife amongst. Khans themselves. Certain Tehran Khans are hostile to Zafar and ourselves.

Ashjaa also being in receipt of our assistance Zafar is jealous. (2) Discussion on protection of roads took place at Ram Hormuz. Special envoy of Ali Murad Khan Taibi attended and Khans offered tomans 1,700 on condition four specified hostages were given by Ali Murad Khan Taibi. (3) Fifty sowars are being sent to Behbahan under brother of Muntasin- ed-Dowlek, Habib Ulla Khan who will be Deputy Governor. (4) Loan of two mountain guns is Zafar’s chief desire and he hints at resignation if he does not get them. After attaining object of reducing Ali Mahomet Khan Taibi from Behbahan, Zafar then wishes as overt sign of our support to take them to Yailak.

Cabinet is tottering and Prime Minister is trying to obtain Bakhtiari support for it by promising various governorships. Ispahan to M. Khan, Burujird, or Kermanshah and Yezd to Jang and Sirdar Muhtasham and for Mufak'ham possibly a seat in the Cabinet. Khans are without doubt attracted by proposal although they would scarcely be so foolish as to join a losing cause. If they joined Mustaufi-al-Mamalek they would explain their action bv saying they w is hod to be a cheek on Extremist elements in Cabinet. They would hope that we should be embarrassed to oust them from the anglophil cabinet which the advance of our troops will bring about. But the acquisition bv them of such wide spread influence would not suit us and in particular M. Q. could not be tolerated at Ispahan. Everything possible to prevent Khans accepting Mustaufi-al-Mamaleks is being done. But I think lllkh n should be informed of this intrigue and shown that one result uould certainly be his own displacement. Then he could probably persuade them that he must be consulted before this kind of agreement can be made. Enclosure No. 5. Telegram, No. 59, dated (and received) the 7th April 1918. From—H r.

Reference your No. 340, object in my opinion of any proposals for maintaining power of present Illkhani and Illbegi should be formation of strong personal ties between Zafar and His Majesty’s Government. Provided he remains Illkhani I would advocate payment of a personal monthly subsidy This would in my opinion be cheaper in the end and he would be mrv™ subservient to our wishes. Murtaza Kuli Khan and Mujahid should, if possible, be kept out of Bakhtiari country. Sheikh of Mohammerah might succeed in restraining latter if Samsam could be persuaded to restrain the former. Otherwise stray action should be taken in connection with payment of land taxes and their property in Arabistan.. I know that Khans in the South and in Tehran would be deterred by the authority of a Political Officer at Kamuz But it appointed he should be ostensibly to support Zafar and approved by him.. As to the great moral effect of loan of two mountain guns I am inclined to agree with Zafar.

Reference correspondence ending ifvith Dr. Young’s telegram 56 of 1st Anril I enclose copy of a letter from Dr. Young reporting the delivery of the arms and ammunition. The form of receipt given by the Khans is very satisfactory and from his experience Dr. Young is confident they wiH not break a proimse made to hiin. further, the trouble gone to in publicly noting the number of every rifle has invested the loan with an importance in the eyes both of the Khans and the tribesmen which it might not otherwise have had. I have thanked Dr. Young for the great trouble he has taken in this connection. Copy of a letter from Dr. Young to His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, dated the 5th April 1918. I have the honour to endlose herewith the following (1) Receipt, in original, for 298 rifles and 3C,000 rounds ammunition delivered to Illkbani’s Representatives by me. One rifle was sent to lllkhani about a fortnight ago at his request as he wished to weigh and measure it with the view of ordering boxes for the transport of the rifles up country. In all, lllkhani received i99 rifles. As there should have been 300, one was missing. (2) List, in duplicate, of number of each rifle delivered. Although I have not been instructed to do this, I thought it best to note down the numbers. The reason is obvious. (3) Translation of Khans’receipt obtained at Malamir. I trust that the form of this receipt will be approved. In the first place, I felt that in order to make them appreciate what we were doing, some “ show ” was necessary. {Secondly, as the responsibility of handing over these arms rested with me, the least I could personally ask the Khans was to promise me faithfully that they would never use them in any manner detrimental to British interests.

Written promise of Khans has been received that guns will only be used for reduction of Kubgilu* and without consent of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul for no other purpose what ever—also that they will be returned to Ahwaz after expedition, and in any case within six months. In case of failure to observe above undertaking they have pledged whole of their properties in Arabistan to be forfeited to Hi* Majesty’s Government. 2. Agreement has been made that Khans shall themselves go to Kubgilu. They have telegraphed to young Khans in Chaharmahal to come south at once. Till conclusion of Kuhgilu operations they think it wisest to leave Mujahid and Shahab in north. 3. They request loan without interest of tomans 10,000 to meet expenses of fitting out expedition. This to be repaid in instalments within six months and secured by oil companies subsidy for guarding. There should however be no difficulty in repaying loan out of Kuhgilu revenues within specified time. Matter is urgent may this loan be given ? 4 . Poliowing was decided after frank discussion with Zafar on subsidy, ^ next autumn lump sum of tomans 6,000 to be paid to Illkhani and Illbegi jointly which equals 600 per month. Question of Illbegi is thus disposed of. To Zafar personally a sum of tomans 1,600 per month to be given, and this the Imperial Bank of Persia, Ispahan, should pay secretly to his agent there, first instalment April 30th. Provided Zafar remains Illkhani and conforms to pur wishes in every way payment will be continued till end of war. Khans have given written undertaking to expel hostile agents and check enemy intrigues. Tomans 400 per month remain to complete sum of 2,600 mentioned by you. If you could leave this at my disposal for use in emergency if, necessary, it would be very helpful. Doctor Young and I who have been in close touch throughout Conventions were particularly impressed with helpful attitude of Khans. They showed readiness to conform to our wishes in every way.

He begged me to take action for his protection immediately.

I remarked that, in those circumstances, he bad better ask to be transferred from Meshed, hut bis reply was that as Nicolsky was under orders to go why should he. We parted good friends.

Unless new developments arise we could, just now, only drive the focus of intrigue, and the prisoners at large, to some other place.

At present Afghan territory ends at Zulfikar and we should be aware of the passage of any parties across our line both south of Meshed and north to the hill passes immediately south of Kalat-i-Nadiri. It would certainly be useless to place a post at Kalat-i-Nadiri, first because bearing we were there an enemy party would clear round across the ilussian border, and second because the Kalat people themselves catch wen parties, and usually send them to Meshed under direction of the local Jrersian authority. Thus our Cordon is at present sufficiently prolonged to effect its object, Afghanist^^ a 8 ams ^ exit from or entrance of enemy parties into • . The ^ is however another factor becoming more apparent every day, the'border ^^ ° £ eiiemy prisoner3 escaping from Russia are coming overUsually they are arrested by some local Persian authority and sent on to Tehran. Already a small but fairly steady trickle of such prisoners seems to be setting in. It is entirely beyond my prorince to offer my suggestions as to the political aspects of this movement. I do however think it may be useful to you to know what we could do to stop the movement above referred to, if it were thought worth while. To deny access at all Effectively it will probably be necessary to hold posts at Bujnurd, Kuchan and Sabzawar and, because the people around the first two places, especially, are armed and under their own Chiefs with whom we want no trouble if it can be avoided, the posts would have to be reasonably strong. To carry out this extension, I would indeed recommend, very largely for its moral value, which would undoubtedly be immense both to the east and west of Meshed, a battery of M. B. R. A. also .one Infantry Battalion, and one Mounted Infantry or failing that a Cavalry Regiment and these working in conjunction with the Persian Cossack Brigade posts at Shahrud and Astarabad should be able to deal with fair effectiveness with escaped enemy prisoners from Russian territories. Certain additional subordinate Medical and Supply personnel would be required but not much. Following is provisional suggested distribution—1 M. B. R.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. It seems probable that with the apparent collapse of all resistance by Caucasus the Turks will be in possession of Julfa and Baku within a com paratively short time. With quick and safe communication with Constanti nople, they will thus be admirably placed to carry on their North-West and North Persia and Trans-Caucasus designs. To me it seems impossible for Turkey to produce in these regions any formidable force for military operations, on the other hand, nothing to resist them. Hence the prospect is disquieting. It is possible no doubt that Persia may take alarm and throw herself into our arms. On the other hand it is more likely that she may timidly go over to the enemy if they are able to make any show of superior force. I submit therefore that before that position is reached we should endeavour to make sure of (—?) Persia by making alliance with her. It seems that Vosough-ed-Dowleh (see my telegram No. 423) is ready for such a policy on what terms we do not know. The striking advantage that he mentioned that we must offer, may perhaps be a promise of territorial concession in Turkish Kurdistan. May I have your very early views and instructions ? The possibility of trouble in Pars (see Gough’s telegram Nos. 28 to India, 68 to Baghdad, repeated in my tele gram No. 429) makes it advisable to waste no time in bringing Vosough-ed- X)owleh in.This possibility, it is hardly necessary to say, makes it more than ever imperative for us to make position in Tehran safe by early arrival of our troops in Hamadan. Any suggestion of alliance would be useless without visible proof of our military power.

' 4 I Summary No. IL Sardar Nasir has been sent to Baghdad. It is reported that Sardar Moktadir, alias Akbar, Mahomet Taqi Beg, Walad-Begi and a few followers are in Jaf country near Shirwan river, and that Sardar Rashid and other chiefs have gone in persuit after them. There is general relief at the dis appearance ot the late Sinjabi chiefs tribal politics, and I have received letters from the principal Sinjabi headmen expressing satisfaction. Steps have been taken to collect and settle the tribe under a chief with an hereditary right to the chiefship. Sardar Amjad seized the leaders of Ittahad movement at Nihavand and sent them to Doulatabad to the Bakhtiari Governor. He has sent a repre sentative to the Consulate. Gendarmes were disarmed and disbanded. An enquiry has been made by Revenue Department, Kermanshah, whether the despatch of collectors to Zohab and tribal country would have our approval and support. Local Government has been unable for some years to take this revenue. Abbas Khan Kalhor proposed a plan forcibly to evict the present Governor with whom there is much dissatisfaction and establish Amir Kul, but was told that scheme would not be countenanced. Cholera is reported at Senneh, stated to have come from Meribue district. Kurdistan is in state of a anarchy, Mandoumis and Qalbaghi plundering, villages within a few miles of Senneh. Excellent crop prospects throughout the provinces. 245 Telegram R., No. 31, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) May 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. It is reported that Soulat is about 25 miles south of Shiraz with a large body of men, women having been sent away. Only four men of the Burji Taimuri garrison on Sineh Sufid hills which w as ordered to evacuate and retire on Khaneh Zinian have come in, the other 16 are said to have joined enemy, but they may have been captured. Khaneh Zinian is practically cut off2* but should be able in the opinion of the General Staff to hold out indefinitely. Strong letters have been sent to Soulat by Farman larma who is working in liis own way so far very successfully to prevent cohesion of Mullahs, et cetera, here against, us. Kawam is being asked by me to bring in 400 men or so to act as occasion * may require. lam sending messages to Mahomet Ali Khan to induce him to act as thorn in Soulat’s side. Soulat is very afraid to act openly without Government instructions and promises of help from towns people and Arabs ; the hot-heads of tribe and the women are however egging him on. I I do not think Kashgais will take any forward movement in strength unless encounter is precipitated by meeting between troops and tribesmen; they have already committed themselves however in Khaneh Zinian direction, but I hope with Farman Farma’s help to stave off further commitments for a few days by which time a new Cabinet may have healthy influence on situa tion.

General Staff now tell me that there is no water-supply inside Khaneh Zinian fort. It is surrounded and I am anxious about its fate. Effect on whole country and on loyalty of rest of South Persia Rifles would be very bad indeed, should garrison surrender by treachery or for want of water. For a column to march to its relief might bring on hostilities at once. Should it fall, General Staff consider and I agree that prestige would demand that column should go out and attack. Soulat’s letters are very full of fight. His exact whereabouts are not known but he is within striking distance of both Shiraz and Khaneh Zinian. Meanwhile Cabinet has telegraphed to Farman Farma telling him to order Soulat to keep the peace and more or less admitting that Darashuris were responsible for origin of conflict. Farman Farma is sending Soulat the telegram.

It has storage for 7 days* water. 14 tribesmen in Sangar barred their way and opened fire. South Persia Rifles drove off tribesmen killing 1 in Sangar whose clothing was of style used by Tufangchis of Nasr Divan of Kazerun. Having delivered water Captain Will returned to Khaneh Zinian.

He was interviewed by me yesterday and I suggested that he should visit India, but he seemed afraid of being accused of deserting his command. His presence in Persia undoubtedly has a pernicious influence on our dealing with Bieharakov and when latter leaves, Baratov will intrigue to get command of Persian Cossack Division. It is my opinion that the longer he stays away from Persia the better, and I suggest the advisability of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief requesting him to spend the rest of the hot weather in India. If the Commauder-in- Chief can see his way to it, a personal invitation might induce Baratov to go to India; otherwise he may return at an early date to Persia.

From—The General Officer Commanding, East Persia Cordon, Birjand, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. I have the honour to report, for your consideration, my impressions gained in a recent tour from Birjand to Meshed and back— (1) Geographical Points — (a) The Triangle Kain-Rui khaf-Turbat-i-Haidari— This tract contains an ideal route for those leaving or entering Afghan istan secretly. It runs generally from Sangun Pain through Maina through a country easy for camels, well watered, yet without cultivation or villages.- IB I therefore propose not only to spy the land but to place new levy posts at Maina and Amrani. (b) Tract Turbat-i-Haidari to Meshed— This again is one that lends itself convenient for secret travel and by bve- ways. When more levies are available posts will be held at convenient places between Turbat and Meshed. At present a detachment of 28th Light Cavalry is at Sharifabad to examine travellers through this junction of the Tehran and Turbat to Meshed routes. The general idea of the dispositions forwarded to you in my letter No. 52—260-S. C., dated the 22hd January 1918, was “ to keep regular troops as far as possible in reasonably big groups; to fill the intermediate posts with levies, and the whole tentacled with spies I propose still to keep to this in principle though the sizes of the groups foreshadowed in the above quoted letter need modification and for the following reasons, viz.: II. Political Factors .—When the question of extending northwards first presented itself, intelligence at my disposal pointed to the main factors :— (1) Meshed is surrounded to east, west and north by well armed tribes. f2) Wandering robber bands on all roads particularly south and west of Meshed. (3) Democrat agitators with a policy against everyone but themselves; (4) A resentful Civil Government more or less alive and with a little force behind it, and I have since become aware oy (5) A Section of Russianized Caucasians in Meshed itself more or less armed, handy and amenable to the instructions of Russian and other intri guers. Since going to Meshed, and having discussed matters with the Consul- General and Colonel Redl, and having seen personally the countryside, the people and their reception of us, I thought that of the Political factors mentioned above, (2) may be largely discounted, but the others all point to the probability that it may become necessary to threaten, and possibly actually to use force, more especially in Meshed. (Ill) When it comes to using force in a city Is large as Meshed its mere size demands a certain minimum strength, irrespective of the force to be subdued. I am therefore reinforcing the present garrison of Meshed, vis., one squadron and one company with machine guns by one company of l-19th Punjabis due there at end of April and yet another company of that unit which is on its way, but which I intend to use on road making in the neigh bourhood of Turbat but ready to move should necessity arise. ° This increase by two companies at Meshed of the orisinally contemplated garrison will seriously weaken the other posts, none of which were unneces sarily strong. I therefore ask that these two companies sent to Meshed as reinforcements may be replaced by fresh troops. .

Consequently, the imperative necessity for the utmost discretion regarding any action in this venerated city will be readily realised by you. The reinforcement you suggest has been approved {vide No. 32471, dated April 25th, 1918) but you should bear in mind that, except in the most exceptional circumstances requiring immediate decision, offensive action should not be taken without previous reference to me. 263 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6535, dated the 17th May 1918.)

Your 38119, 15th May. Please rest content that the avoidance of collision with the Persians is my steadfast aim. The principal object of an increased garrison at Meshed is that agitators there may find it less easy to use Caucasian budmashes with or without the connivance of the authorities, to force a conflict and make capital of it. This is unlikely to happen if the new Governor plays up. 265 Telegram P., No. 38, dated the 26th (received 27th) May 1918.

According to reports received during the night fighting took place near Deh Sheikh on the morning of May 25th, our casualties being about 18, including Major Brown, 15th Lancers, killed, while the enemy lost at least 350 killed and wounded. Orton who is commanding our force is in pursuit in the direction of Khaneh Khabis. Most of the South Persia Rifles garrison of Khaneh Zinian are now- marching in here unarmed. The post fell probably through treachery. No news of the fate of Captain Will and the British Serjeant with him. Have not yet received details or official reports.

Latest information from Tehran indicates that a prompt display of military force in Persia would have most important political result. Failure to take such action would mean the losing of a favourable opportunity of enlisting the active support of the Persian Government in our favour. The force of 1 cavalry regiment, 1 battalion and armoured cars mentioned in your 7756 (8756 ?), May 12th, is not considered sufficient to effect this object. Your operations against Tigris valley have been most skilfully carried out and I have no doubt will have gone far to achieve their object which was to mfiict a severe blow on the 13th Turkish Corps and to threaten the flank of their advance through Azerbaijan. For the time being however, these operations have reached their limit. Every effort must therefore, be made by you to maintain a force up to 1 cavalry regiment and* 1 infantry brigade with aeroplanes and armoured cars at Hamadan and towards the Caspian. I attach the greatest importance to your reaching the Caspian***•« n this summer even with a small force.

It is reported that Soulat with a force variously estimated from 3,000 to 10,000 and probably 3,000 or 4,000, is moving into camp about eight miles south-south-west of Chinar Rabdar. Yesterday evening Captain Will’s Persian servant from Khaneh Zinian reached Shiraz with a note from Will saying that the fort was closely invested. The servant stated that the well in the fort had run dry, and that the Kashgais -would cut off the water channel running alongside the fort. However, there is a small stream sixty yards from the fort and the garrison should be able to replenish water from it. Special messengers sent to ascertain. There are, it is estimated, 2,000 Kasbgais around Khaneh Zinian and a con siderable number, possibly 6,000 in Hash tarjan. A jehad is being preached by Soulat’s Mullahs, and all Kashgais are united and aggressive. A commu nication is being sent by Consul to Mohammed Ali Khan, Qashquli^but Soulat is also trying to again his support. There are reports of simultaneous hostile action to be taken by Boir Ahmedis against Abadeh and by Kuhistanis and Lashanis against Niriz. At 9 to-morrow evening, section Mountain Artillery and Wing Baluchis, are due at Shiraz from Zargun. The situation is serious especially as Hashtistan men are saia to be joining Soulat. In order to detach Hashtistan men I strongly advocate some threat of action from Bushire and also the despatch of about (some ?) aeroplanes via Bushire to Shiraz, where the avenue fronting the Consulate affords a good landing place 1,000 yards long and 30 yards wide. A great effect would he produced by the bombing of Kashgais camps. This telegram has been concurred in by the Consul. 275 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. 6838, dated the 21th May 1918.)

But it tends to prove that Captain Will and Sergeant Coomber were murdered by the Zinian garrison and that the garrison handed over 140 rifles and 60,000 rounds to Kashgais. Of the garrison some have not returned. Those who have marched in including, it is believed, some of these implicated in murder have been arrested. Execution appears to be only possible sentence if guilt is proved. This will very probably mean trouble in face of very uncertain loyalty of the South Persia Rifles. Their guns, machine guns and ammunition are in hands of British officers and 1 am suggesting to Sykes advisability of removing their pouch ammunition also. Orton’s column is meanwhile returning to Shiraz and will possibly meet determined opposition. Small reinforcement is being sent out from here. Casualties reported to be moderately heavy; Dobbs’ 124th Baluchis is now reported among the killed. Though heavily defeated Kashgais are still authenticly very dangerous, it is believed that the South Persia Rifles are thoroughly untrustworthy and might turn against us; while the Kawam, if he thought the enemy the winning side, would be strongly tempted to join them. On the other hand, Indian column is _ (?) and mobilizing and I believe Shiraz contains plenty of food and ammunition. The telegraph line being in danger, I explain situation as it now (4-00 p.m.) stands; though when the column is safely in it may prove much more favourable.

If we sit here inactive, both consider that we will find every road closed, and we w i l l be starved out in two months. I venture to urge the inadequacy of the force Sykes asks for. If adequate force sent forthwith, we can hold on till their arrival. Inaction, however, will he fatal to the force now here and to British interests in Southern Persia.

But we cannot expect him to be able to follow as friendly a policy as he would like with the Shiraz trouble on our hands, with ^ little prospect, so far as I can see, of troops in adequate numbers being pushed up from Mesopotamia, and with the sudden abandonment of Dunsterville mission to the Caucasus which must lead to the belief that we consider ourselves important against enemy effort towards so vital a position as Baku. If it appeared that Soulet had lost courage, situation would he somewhat relieved. Serious fact in Persian eyes, however, still remains that British troops have fought Persians. At present the most important thing is to hasten arrival of troops at Hamadan by all means possible. This is with reference to your telegram No. 585-S.

With the exception of the Burma Mounted Bifles, who occupy a post about 5 miles to west of town with a view to guarding entrance (group undecypherable) and patrol work, Indian troops are concentrated in Shiraz. F So doubtful is loyalty of South Persia Rifles as a whole, that their commander strongly advises they should not be used in operations; South Persia Rifles Cavalry, however, is to be employed for reconnaissance purposes only. Fifth Infantry to which Khaneh Zinian garrison belonged is being deprived of all ammunition, remainder retain only pouch ammunition. (? Ex-officio) senior Persian officer of the 5th Infantry has been arrested and further arrests will probably follow. British officers and non-commissioned officers are being recalled from outposts except Niriz, which is said to have been attached and captured by enemy, Abadeh where there are 150 Indians and Dehbid where there are about 50. It is said that Soulet has ret urned to Khaneh Khabis, the scene of the late fighting, and is said to be full of fight. Strong telegram from Persian Government referred to in your telegram No. 60 (?) may have some effect on him and his men, but I doubt if telegram will have very deterrent effect as he has gone so far.

I have the honour to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of telegram No. 124-S., dated the 6th February last, conveying the sanction of the Government of India to the expenditure on famine relief work in Meshed of 1,000 rupees per mensem for four months, and to submit a brief report of the measures taken. 2. Prior to the receipt of this sanction our relief work at this Consulate had been limited to the feeding of some 70 poor British Indian subjects daily with an occasional extension of hospitality to 40 or 50 Persians: while a larger number continued to be fed at the American Mission premises accord ing to the funds available. Upon the receipt of your telegram under acknowledgment it was arranged that the number entertained daily on our premises should be increased to five or six hundred. 3. After this arrangement had continued for some days during which it became evident that distress was rapidly increasing, Ur. Esselstyn, the HeaA of the Mission, informed me that he was about to receive a sum of ten thousand tomans for famine relief work from friends in America; and suggested that we should extend the operations on our premises which were so much larger and more suitable than his own. We thereupon decided to feed 2,000 people daily in the Consulate, expend ing the four thousand rupees sanctioned by Government in addition to a sum of 175 tomans which I had collected by private subscription. When this total amount was nearly exhausted, Dr. Esselstyn’s remittance arrived, and the work has continued uninterruptedly on a large scale: there having been some times over 3,000 people entertained in one day. 4. The political effect of this work has been curious. As may have been expected the number of our friends has largely increased, but the jealousy and rancour of the extreme democrats have rather been heightened than other wise by the success we have achieved. They have been consistent in their efforts to prevent the acquisition by us of the large amount of bread required for daily distribution, and in consequence of this malicious opposition we have unfortunately been compelled, on one or two occasions, to send a number of people away hungry owing to insufficiency of bread. 5. The Rev. Dr. Esselstyn has been untiring in his labours. He attends our premises daily to superintend the work, and, recognising as he does how much Persia owes to the British, takes an evident pleasure in assisting to ra4e our prestige. He deserves, in my opinion, the warm thanks of His Majesty’s Government, and I venture to hope that I maybe privileged to convey to him some expression of their approval in due course. 6.

Melnikov. This tribunal was convened at the request of my Russian colleague, and was designed to allow Russian officers the satisfaction of taking pan in an enquiry into a matter which had naturally aroused con siderable feeling among their community in Mehsed. 2. Brigadier-General Dale, while here recently, caused a British Military Court of Enquiry to assemble. This Court after recording all available evidence found that no blame attached to any officer or soldier, British or Indian, in connection with the affair: and the proceedings were kindly lent to me for the perusal of the mixed tribunal which ultimately agreed with the British Court after considerable discussion in the course of which Colonel Scouratt, from whom some trouble was expected, tried to prove that it was not yet dark when the tragedy occurred and that M. Melnekov had produced his revolver with a view to surrender it to the troops. Colonel Gouschtchine of whose friendship and loyalty to us you are already aware, and Captain Kousnetsov who appeared to follow the views of Colonel Gouschtchine, assisted me in convincing Colonel Scduratt that the conclusion arrived at by the British I Court was the correct one. 3. The circumstances of the occurrence were as detailed in my telegram above referred to. It appears that when the cavalry patrol approached &amp; the carriage containing M. M. Melnikov and Kharitonov and ordered them in the Persian language to stop their carriage and descend, M. Melnikov who knew no Persian objected, asking his companion why they should obey. It is diffi cult to believe that he then produced the revolver with a view to surrender it although it was still in its case when produced. The most probable explana tion is that the unfortunate man lost his head and scarcely knew what he was doing. 4. I had of course no idea that M. Melnikov intended to proceed to Turbat-i-Haidari. On the day preceding his death I discussed him at great length with my colleague in connection with a commercial matter pending in dispute between his firm and the Imperial Bank of Persia, and M. Nicolsky was aware that our troops were on the point of arrival and that they were coming from Turbat. Colonel Gouschtchine expressed at the tribunal a strong opinion concerning M, Nicolsky’s neglect, as he put it, in not having informed me of M. Melnikov’s impending journey so that arrangements might be made for his safety. 5. I attach a translation of the opinion recorded by the mixed tribunal. 6. A copy of this letter and its enclosure will be submitted to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran. (Translation.) PROTOCOL. We, the undersigned, assembled at 11 a.m., on the 3/16th April 1918, at the Biitish Consulate-General, to enquire into the circumstances attending the death of M. Peter Melnikov who was killed at Sharifabad on the 6/19th March last.The proceedings of the British Military Court of enquiry were read to u* and also the evidence of M. Kharitonov who accompanied M. Melnikov. After a long discussion upon these documents and the circum stance* relating to the affair, we decide that, in conformity with the opinion expressed by General Dale, no blame can be attributed to any officer or soldier, British or Indian: if, on the^he”Hahd, it is possible that M. Melnikov may have brought out his revolver simply to hand it over to the soldiers, on the other hand it is certain that, in the darkness, the Indian officer believed that in thus acting M. Melnikov intended to shoot him. Drawn up at Meshed on the date given above. President. (Signed) William George Gret, Lieut.-Col. t Mii Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in Khotasan.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Foreign Office have sent following 356, December 20th :— After careful consideration of Persian situation as depicted in your t Ending with Serial No. ioi. recent telegramsf Eia Majesty’s Govern- ment have arrived at following decisions t Serial No. 92 . on P oints raised in your telegramj No. 446 which for facile reference I answer seriatim ; (1) You have authority to give Vossuk-ed-Powleh an assurance in general terms that provided Cabinet at Tehran evidence a willingness on their part to work in harmony with His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to afford genuine aid to Persia. (2) His Majesty’s Government are prepared to look favourably on consti tution after war of a uniform force for whole Persia in which South Persia Rifles will he eventually incorporated. The retention of British officers in the South Persia Rifles at least for duration of war and for six months after its termination must, however, he insisted upon. After this period they will consider question of appointing neutral officers subject to conditions you § Serial No. 76 in Part xiv. enumerate in paragraph 1 of your tele gram No. 236.§ On the formation of a stable government in Russia they would be also prepared to try to induce them to adopt similar attitude in regard to Cossack Division. (3) His Majesty’s Government will agree to regard Anglo-Russian Agree ment as in suspense, its formal cancellation cannot, however, be arranged without concurrence of a properly constituted government in Russia.(4) Should an International Conference be assembled at tbe close of war and should non-belligerent nations generally take part in it, tbe presence of Persian representatives would be welcome to His Majesty’s Government. (5) I presume you calculate the sum of tomans 250,000 a month as ^follows : Moratorium 100,000 tomans, Subvention 100,000 tomans, Mora torium arrears 50,000 tomans. This expenditure is approved if necessary; you will, however, doubtless endeavour to secure acceptance of a smaller sum, especially in the case of subvention. (6) You have also authority as regards this payment for Cossack Division. Any useless or disloyal elements however should not be paid, but should be dis banded, thus proportionately reducing cost. (7) You should point out to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh that maintenance of order is equally desired in British interests. His Majesty’s Government realise Persian Government have no adequate force for the purpose and His Majesty’s Government will therefore continue to employ South Persia Rifles so as to further the common desire of Persian Government and His Majesty’s Govern ment in this respect, and they will similarly consider favourably possibility of making over to Persian Government arms and equipment of this force after the war. No credit is therefore necessary in present circumstances for these purposes. His Majesty’s Government, however, propose to place at disposal of Persian Government a detachment of armoured cars for preservation of order in North- West Persia and instructions will be sent for their early despatch. As car detachment will operate in case of need on Resht-Kasvin-Hamadan road this may be held to cover point 8. As regards Shah and guarantees mentioned in your telegram* No. 435 I concur in your views and authorise you to act as proposed subject to conditions set ♦Serial No. 79, vide also Serial No. 78. forth in that telegram. Government of India should be sent a copy of this telegram. 108 t Telegram P., No. 1211-S., dated the 21st December 1917.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- ment, Delhi. (Addressed Tehran, repeated Ispahan and Secretary of State.) Dr. Young sends following from Ahwaz :—• Begins. I am told by Sirdar Zafar that be does not intend to come south this winter. He feels he can no longer continue as Illkhani having met with staunch opposition from his brother Khans and received no support whatever from Teh ran. He has neither money nor arms, and the revenue of country has already decreased enormously on account of prevailing scarcity. He has not even been able to draw our own quarterly instalment owing to ihe low rate of exchange and I have it in deposit for him. He states that he would require about 50,000 tomans for his journey south and his campaign against Kuhgilus. He says that he has again telegraphed to the Minister and Khans in Tehran, and unless he receives a favourable reply he proposes to resign. I have urged him to come south but without success, and two junior Khans, Sirdar Eateh and Ali Mohamed Khan, are coming instead. The unprecedented absence of the Illkhani from the South in the winter will, I am sure, have a bad effect in country. Should he resign, the Bakhtiaris will get out of hand, as I doubt whether any of the other Khans will take charge without some guarantee and whether even if they do any of them will be loyal to us. His resignation will also strengthen the hands of a section hostile to us who have maintained that Zafar like Mohtasham will have to go because our support was withheld. But my real fear is that unless Zafar is assisted, he also will end by joining the opposition and it seems to me a risk which we should not take in the present state of things with Russia in her present condition and with the possibility later of a renewal of enemy activity in the country. My opinion is that some assistance should be given him and I would urgently recommend this for serious consideration. Addressed Baghdad ; repeated Ahwaz. Ends. I am of opinion that non-arrival of Illkhani in low country would involv e grave risk of unrest in Oil fields region and am therefore authorising Young to give Sirdar temporary accommodation on my behalf and to express my hope that he will not fail to come down. Ill Telegram P., No. 474* (464 ?*)-F., dated the 21st (received 22nd) December 1917. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed London Foreign Office.) ^ Local democrats are in communication with Germans in Petrograd, and Nadolni is asserted to be on his way to Tehran as German Minister with large staff. Report gives them great encouragement though it may be untrue. They are also in close relations with Maximalist soldiery, who have practically expelled Russian Consul from Kazvin and have come to ^Tehran. There are apprehensions that they will endeavour to take over Russian Lega tion. They are promising to support anti-British party, and also attempt ing to gain over rank and file of Persian cossacks. The Jangalis also have been infected with anti-British poison and are enlisting support of soldiery at Resht and Enzeli, from whom they have bought at least 1 machine gun and a considerable quantity of rifles and ammunition. It is reported by Belgian Customs Director at Enzeli that practically all the soldiers returning to Russia are selling rifles before leaving. * Vide Serial No. 113.In this now threatening state of things I doubt whether Vossuk-ed- Dowleh will take office on the terms laid *seual o. 10 . down in your telegram* No. 356. He will point out that the South Persia Rifles cannot be used in the north and that the l,4iOO Cossacks in Tehran must he kept there to hold the gendarmerie in check. The gendarmerie are a very doubtful quantity, many very undesirable charac ters, especially officers who were with Nizam-us-Sultaneh, having been readmitted by the late Government. The Cossacks may also possibly have to guard town against entry of Maximalist soldiery from Kasvin. Hence as the fleet of motor cars can obvious]y not arrive for some time, money is absolutely necessary, not only to buy arms and to raise irregu lar forces against the Jangalis, but also to excite local opposition to them and for other secret service purposes. Yossuk-ed-Dowleh would pro bably be satisfied if we promised two million tomans spread over a period say of six months. He will also expect a more explicit declaration on points (2) and (3). I request therefore authority to negotiate with him within the limits of his own suggestions. I am to see him in morning. I am told by Piruz Mirza that the Shah has intimated that he expects an annual pension of tomans 100,000 in addition to the annual value of his properties.

Shah has for moment declined to accept Ain-ed-Dowleh’s resignation which has just been tendered waiting our acceptation of his terms which he has now put into figures. He requires guarantee of pension of tomans 100,000 and a proper security (as regards ?) his personal estates or pay him their capital value if w r e cannot recover possession for him. In addition, however, he now asks for tomans 15,000 a month while Vossuk-ed-Dowleh remains in office and a lump sum of tomans 100,000. I have given him to understand that his demands are preposterous and that we cannot entertain the last two. It seems to me, however, expedient to agree to the first and also to the second with the proviso that capital sum will be fixed later. These two assurances would be given in (group undecypherable) alter Vossuk-ed-Dowleh receives his firman giving him full powers. We shall also have to give him pretty definite pro mises of substantial gratuities so long as he behaves himself which might run to tomans 50,000. May I settle with him on these lines ? Answers to both Shah and Vossuk* ed-Dowleh should be given by December 25th as I fear Shah’s resistance to democrats will hardly last longer than that. ^Serial No 113 Tilis is witil reference to my telegram 467*. 115 Telegram R., No. 6259, dated (and received) the 23rd December 1917. from—The Political Resident to the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Repeated Secretary of State for India,) In reply to request for appreciation of situation in North, Noel wires as follows : -Begins. Position is that His Majesty’s Government decided support in every wmy project of Caucasian Pederation. Things, however, seem to be hanging fire as political and financial side of question is being dealt with through Tehran and General Shore prefers to take his instructions direct from War Office. Both Tehran and Tiflis agree that apart from purely military side of question Shore is in need of strong staff which should have two sides :— (a) financial, (b) Political and propagandist. It will require very determined effort on our part to give lift to Caucasian Pederation as Germans are already in field and have in existence a formidable organisation. The first ^ and most pressing problem is to form some central authority which Georgians, Tartars, Armenians, mountain tribesmen will recognize. This can probably best be effected by presence of small British unit of about 1,000 men to supply a rallying point for genuine friendly elements in country. Shore strongly advocates this policy. Other problems which will demand immediate attention are (1) Pighting German propaganda. (2) Organization and distribution food supplies.9 telega (3) Establishment of line of communication with outside world. Fail ing trans-Siberia iiailway we shall have to organize communica tion across Persia. (4) Supply of certain articles of necessity to Caucasians such as medi cines, cotton goods. (5) Disposal of Baku oil. it h iesei1 ^ Tartars realize disadvantage of Turkish rule and it should erefore be our policy to foster and take advantage of this feeling and at the same time we might aim at bringing them into touch with loyal Mahom- medan eleme its m Mesopotamia and India with a view to forming a solid block of Mahommedan opinion and opposed to pro-German party in Turkey and Persia. Realization of this policy would greatly facilitate reconciliation ha-e toTace 41,111611 ^ 11 mterests whicl1 is one of the most difficult problems we * , i 1U c ? n ® iliatin g Mahommedan opinion in Caucasus it is pro ab e that Tartar and Turk element in Azerbaijan province will wish to 30 m Caucasian Federation and throw off their allegiance to Persia. This would provide strong oveapon in dealing with Persian question. Ends. I beg that if there is no objection I may be informed as to nature of Caucasian Confederation and of measures contemplated by His Majesty’s Government. It seems to me that any organization to work Northern Persia cannot succeed or maintain itself under present conditions unless based on this ioice and equipped financed and worked from here. lie Telegram P., No. 81-C., dated the 2-3rd (received 24th) December 1917.

Orders have been sent to Prussian troops in Khorasan to leave Persia, and Officer Commanding has replied that he cannot move until sufficient funds are supplied.

As the Minister’s last view is that arms should be given and as this is strongly urged by Haig Noel and Dr. Young, I trust that issue of the arms will be authorised.

Grant, C.SJ., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in tJie Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my telegram No. 75-C. ,$ of this date, and previous iserial No. 49. correspondence, on the subject of the ,, . „ , recent departure of Wagner and certain other members of the German party from Herat, I have the honour to submit copies of two reports, dated the 8th and 15th of November respectively, sent in by Captain Jansen the officer in command of the Cossack patrol despatched from iurbat-i-Haidan to arrest the party, and a telegram sent from the Officer Commanding the Russian troops at Turbat to the Officer Commanding troops m Hhorasan Meshed, in connection with the deputation. Bor these documents 1 am indebted to the courtesy of Colonel Guschin, the Commandant here, and o Co onel Redl our General Staff Officer who has kindly made the transla tions. J 4 -u r?m Sh0 ? ly after * he return of Captain Jansen’s patrol to Turbat-i-Haidari the Unicer Commanding at that post received a notice from Amir Akram the overnor of Turshiz, that the fugitives had again been secured, and a request a a guard, might he sent out to take them over; and we are now awaiting the news of the return of this party with their prisoners to Turbat-i-Kaidari. -p 1 +iF r( n )a 6 V aptain ^ anserl was correct in his view that it was impossible b ® rn l aas to have 8 ot away, and it seems likely that Zabi Khan, who is the head ot the local Karasuran and a well known ruffian, had resisted the demand made by the young and timorous Governor for the surrender to him ° /i • ca P^ lves * an ^ had induced him to share the plunder with himself an is men . and that Amir Akram had then connived at the escape or concea ment of the Germans on arrival of the Russian patrol ; fearing, as aptam Jansen points out in his first report, that the new comers might ispute with the Persians the possession of the money and arms taken over.3. Erom Captain Jansen’s second report it is practically certain that Wagner was killed in the fight, and, should the news of this incident reach Herat before the departure of Kazim Beg and bis friends {vide my telegram •SerialNo. 49 No -. ' 75 - c -*)&gt; the latter will probably hesitate before disguising themselves as Turkoman outlaws which, intentionally or otherwise, Wagner and his com panions appear to have done. Indeed it is not unlikely that the fate which has befallen this party may cause them to defer their departure indefinitely. 4. The inaction of M. Antipoff, the Russian Vice-Consul at Turbat-i- Haidari, throughout these events is as yet unexplained, but it is conceivable that he preferred to leave the matter to be dealt with by the garrison. The conduct of the Russian Consular Agent at Turshiz shews up, among other facts, the indifferent relations w 7 hich exist between the Russian Consular represent atives and their Persian employes. 5. A further report will be submitted when the news of the arrival of the prisoners at Turbat-i-Haidari is received. A copy of this letter and its enclosures is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran for information. Enclosure No. 1. Report from Captain Jansen to the Officer Commanding, Russian troops, at Turbat-i-Haidari, dated the 8th November 1917. According to information collected, the followers of Mirza Zabi Khan fired upon a party of 10-11 Germans near Sartraz, about 5 farsahhs to the west of Turshiz, on the 2nd November. The leader was shot (name not known), and one or tw 7 o “ Germans ” wounded. The Turshiz Governor states that the arrested persons were transferred to the village Said-ud-din, 8 farsalriis from Turshiz on the Tabas road, where Zabi Khan lives. The Turshiz Governor has refused to hand over the Germans on the grounds that he has neither the authority of the Consul nor that of the Karguzar. Mirza Zabi Khan and his chief Aziz-ullah Khan have at their disposal some hundreds of w T ell armed sowars, and evidently have no intention of handing over the Germans, fearing that we shall demand the money—two mule loads— and the rifles taken from them. In order to obtain forcible possession of the Germans from the Persians my patrol must be reinforced by 40-50 Cossacks, who should have money sufficient for 8 days. In the meanwhile I await orders at Turshiz. Please also send dresser with first aid appliances and a hospital to wheeled cart, as there are wounded Germans. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram dated the 11th November 1917. From—The Officer Commanding troops at Turbat-i-Haidari, To—The Officer Commanding troops in Khorasan, Meshed. All spare Cossacks have been sent to help Jansen. According to his report the Governor has refused to hand over the Germans, and the Governor has declared that the Germans have probably fled. Jansen has left for Said-ud-Din. Enclosure No. 3. Report from Captain Jansen to the Officer Commanding, Russian troops, at Turbat-i-Uaidari, dated the 15th November 1917. In continuation of my report of the 8th November I beg to report the following. The German party was surrounded by followers of Mirza Zabi Khan■■ .As.. _ 66 at the village of Sarurad {Note —About 20 miles west of Turshiz) in a garden belonging to the Russian Consular A.gent at Turshiz. At the moment of the attack the Agent himself was in the garden settling accounts with the Germans for forage and supplies which they had bought from him. As soon as the Persians opened bre the Agent fled from the garden. During the exchange of shots the chief of the German party was killed, and a Bakhtiari follower of theirs wounded. The Germans then surrendered. The Agent himself buried the dead man and states that he was a Christian, uncircumcised, with a cross tattooed on his shoulder, fair, of more than average height, well dressed in Turkoman costume—as were the other members of the party—and wearing a gold wrist watch. All had excellent horses and two mules laden with money. They were provided with Kabul jposhteens and armed with 5-shot magazine rifles and Mauser pistols. The assailants divided up the booty, and by order of the Governor of Turshiz, conveyed the prisoners to Said-ud-Din {Note —South of Turshiz on Tabas road), the headquarters of Mirza Zabi Khan. As I previously reported the Governor refused to give any assistance in handing the prisoners over to me, saying that they had, he thought, escaped, but that he had their arms. On the 10th November Lieutenant Rovniagin arrived with 42 Cossacks as a reinforcement for my patrol. I then left for Said-ud-Din arriving at 6 p.m. at the village of Kundur, where I intended to pass the night. Evidently by order of the Governor all houses were shut and not a soul was to be seen in the streets. My patrol was obliged to wait in the street till 10 p.m. while a fruitless search for the village headman and for lodgings proceeded. There were lights in many houses but no answer was ^iven to knock or summons. It was necessary to break in the door of the headman’s house; after which owners of other houses made their appearance. In the absence of a caravan- sarai the horses were picked in a garden containing oleander bushes, and three horses were fatally poisoned. On the march from Kundur to Said-ud-Dih, Cossack—fell ill of cholera and died the same night. A second Cossack was attacked on the following morning, and I despatched him to Turbat-i-Haidari in a hired carriage in charge of my medical subordinate. The deceased Cossack was buried near Said-ud-Din. On my patrol reaching Said-ud-Din, Mirza Zabi Khan disappeared; the assistant to the Governor of Turshiz, who had arrived on the spot, declaring that he had gone to search for the escaped Germans. According to the statement of Zabi Khan’s followers, the Germans had broken through the wall by night, and made good their escape with their horses. I inspected the room in which they had been confined, and in point of fact the wall had recently been broken through towards the courr-yard in which it appeared that their horses had been kept. Blood-stained bandages and cotton wool used for dressing the wounded man were also found. I consider it scarcely possible that the Germans can have escaped, and am of opinion that they were either despatched to Tehran or transferred to some other village and hidden there. It was impossible to obtain any reliable information at Said-ud-Din, as it is inhabited entirely by relations of Zabi Khan and of the savars who had carried out the attack on the Germans. In view of the fruitlessness of a further stay in the village, and of the danger of further cholera infection to the Cossacks the village was in the throes of a cholera epidemic—without any medical personnel on the spot, I decided to return. The Consular Agent at Turshiz, far from assisting me in my dealings with the Governor, took his side in all discussions It is rumoured that he had participated in the division of the Germans’ money and arms, and a 3-line rifle of Cossack pattern was seen in his house by my interpreter. This, after much prevarication and a threat to search his house, he eventually produced. S.O.P.I.,Delhi—No. 518 F.&amp;P.D.—28-12-17—35.Telegram P., No. 1178-S., dated the 13th December 19l7.

Government may find it convenient to have an appreciation of the Southern Persian political situation as viewed from here. Southern Kurdistan. —Please see my memorandum No. 10114, dated the 7th December (in post). Attitude of bulk of tribes and chiefs is definitely anti-Turk, and situation is likely to be eased, if anything, by decrease in llussians. I hope shortly to send Major Soane who is now at Khanikin and has special knowledge of district and exceptional qualifications for influencing the tribes, to see what he can do to organise them with view to harrying Turkish communications and generally to commit themselves on our side; the prevailing famine conditions are, however, a difficult factor. Kermanshah and Kalhor. —Owing to alternate Turkish and Russian invasions, the whole of this district is unstable and mercenary to a degree. Kennion requires an assistant I think to enable him to get into closer touch with tribal leaders and to make suitable arrangements to fill gap caused by Russian defection. I shall endeavour to send one shortly. Pusht-i-Kuh. —Though the Yali is unsatisfactory and at heart pro-Turk, it is unlikely that he will depart from his attitude of neutrality, especially now that the Russians are likely to disappear from the scene. Parties passing between here and Kermanshah through Pusht-i-Kuh are well treated. Luristan. —I have had an officer on special duty at Khorremabad and Burujird during hot weather and according to reports received to-day from him tribes whilst full of conceit at repulse of detachments of Russians, Per sians and Germans passing through their country at different times, are well disposed towards British, and no hostile action in this direction need be anticipated. We need, however, a Political officer in Luristan to watch events and guide them as far as possible, and this I am endeavouring to arrange. Aralistan.—No unfavourable local developments seem probable so long as our present forces at Ahwaz and Shush and oil fields are maintained and our political control of Dizful and Shuster are not relaxed. Bakhtiari. —I am strongly of opinion that the existing Illkhani should be more strongly supported by us than at present and that to keep touch with the situation we should have two Political officers available for duty in this district. Noel has been detained at Baku for the present under orders from^His Majesty’s Embassy, Petrograd, and his future movements seem un certain. HNit is decided to detail him for other work it is most important that a thoroughly competent officer be selected to succeed him, and that he should be assisted by an Intelligence officer.

This is also attitude of our friends here and is illustrated by proposals Vosough-ed-Dowleh communicated to me last night. They have general approval of Shah and run as follows :—His Majesty’s Government are to give, first privately and after he has formed his Cabinet and got to work, assurances in general terms. 1. Genuine assistance and support for Persia’s regeneration. 2. Substitution at end of war for South Persia Bifles of a uniform force, under neutral officers and our good offices if necessary to induce Bussia to agree to similar treatment of Cossack Division. 3. Cancellation of 1907 Convention and cognate agreements. 4. Bepresentation of Persia at International Conference at end of war in which other non-belligerent nations take part. 5. Subvention or advance of tomans 250,000 a month. 6. Payment of Cossack Division tomans 125,000 a month. 7. Arms, or tomans 1,000,000 to purchase them in this country. 8. Credit of 1,000,000 tomans for possible military operations against J angalis and other rebels. In return he undertakes in conjunction with Kavam-us-Sultaneh and Nosreted-Dowleh to govern Persia with a strong hand ruthlessly to crush Democrats and to inaugurate reforms in closest co-operation with us. Vosough-ed-Dowleh and his friends do not in my opinion possess qualities requisite for the carrying out of their programme but first four points in his requirements from us demonstrate value he attaches to compromises from us in order to clear him from an accusation of subserviency to us and enables him tobring about definite reform party.■wtrynp ui torwi Russia to s W to cf Hst 3qu&lt; fits 11 s it I submit we should not hurt our position by giving these assurances.

As regards No. 2, I submit that if the neutral officers are carefully selected and with stipulation suggested in my telegram No. 236,f they can ensure order ” without prejudice to our interests suffi ciently well and that in normal times guarantee of presence of British officers is not essential and that assurance might be given handing over South Persia Eifles to such neutrals when Persian Government is able to bear cost of maintenance and of material supplied. This condition is reasonable and the contingency sufficiently remote to leave whole question open. Vosough-ed- Dowleh himself would be relieved to hear that we decline to accept his proposals ; he would prefer to allow Sipah j nd! Senai No. 8. Salar| to clear ground so that if the latter’s coup came off, he could come forward to assist in constructive work. So far as I can see one or other of them can be brought into office, provided Shah is squared and we give financial support suggested in my telegram 398§. If such a Cabinet was brought in we could later greatly strengthen its position by giving assurances of our policy. In any case general declaration of policy can only do good and appears to me imperative. I earnestly request authority to give assurances to Shah proposed in my telegram 433 [| and promises of financial ' eml No ' ' support to a friendly Cabinet without delay.

With such a Cabinet, backed by numerous revolutionaries and Maximalist Agents who are already in Tehran, and with Obeidulla as an active Turkish Agent very dangerous situation may very easily arise.

Establishment of Extremist Democrat Cabinet would constitute threat to telegraphic communication of London with Tiflis through Persia.

Government of India suggestionf as to gaining over Bakhtiaris is feasible „ and should I suggest be adopted, though it will require some expenditure. It has always been in my mind to win some of Democrat leaders over, partly by a declaration of our policy and partly by personal inducements, and even perhaps find places for one or two moderate men in a Vossuk-ed-Dowleh com bination. An attempt to conciliate the party by concessions, however, would be attended by same results as attempt to conciliate Turkish Committee of Union and Progress in 1911. It would make them masters here, and we should have to yield to every demand to keep them friendly and their friend ship would only be superficial. I am still fairly confident of being able to bring in a friendly combination, but every day’s delay diminishes the chances and I again urge that the authority requested in my telegram No. 133J may be given me at once.

I have been told by Russian Consul-General, who came to see me this morning that the Governor-General in an interview he had just had with him had informed him that Zaky Bey, the Turkish Commander-in-Chief, who is now at Serai had sent the Governor of Khoi a letter by a Turkish officer a few days ago, saying Armenians has been beaten at Van and elsewhere and that happily there were none left in Turkish territory. However as some had fled to Caucasus and some in the direction of Khoi, he begged the Governor to let him know regarding the numbers and intentions of the Armenians in north Azerbaijan. Instructed by the Governor-General here the Governor replied that the Persian Government had no quarrel with the Armenians in Persia who had always been loyal and refused to give the requested particulars. Both the Russian Consul-General and United States Consul are convinced that unless British Military authorities send some force here soon the Turks will most certainly come. Both are of the opinion that quite a small force of 500 to 1,000 men is all that is necessary, as bulk of population would welcome them. United States Consul is reporting to his Government in this sense. It seems my duty to let you know the views of my colleagues, as my knowledge of the people is so small at present, and my sources of information so limited that I do not feel competent to give an opinion. Russian Consul-General believes that Van is again in Turkish hands, he can give me no information, however, as to the strength of the troops there. It is certain that a large number of Armenian refugees from Van are at Kotur ; according to another story many of them have been massacred by Simko and his Kurds wno had gone in that direction to attack Jelus settled in neighbouring villages. Some Turkish troops appear to have been at Ushnu about a fortnight ago and thence despatched couple of their party to Soujbulak. It seems that .after remaining there two days they rejoined their companions. Pamine conditions are said to be especially severe in Soujbulak district. No news from Tiflis to-day.

Orders have not yet been received from Tehran by the Officer Command ing Persian Cossacks to vacate the premises referred to in my No. 33, he hat merely been told to remain where he is. A private caravanserai, of which the Russian Consulate held a lease which has now been transferred to the Brigade, and ruined barracks and stables belonging to the Persian Government on the other side of the road (these latter being the buildings which the Persian Government asked the Officer Commanding the Division to hand over), comprise the premises in question. As early as possible we would like to know definitely that all these premises are to be delivered to us, and we hope that the Officer Commanding Brigade will receive orders to this effect at once. He is prepared to evacuate, but meanwhile is consolidating his position which increases the difficulty in the event of delay. Neither property is of any value without the other. Enclosure No. 4.

Any natives or parties who are willing to oppose Germans and Turks should he assisted by you. Our present policy with regard to the Bolsheviks is to treat them as though they were in good faith until we have proof to the contrary and to cultivate as good relations with them as circumstances permit in the hope that we may be able to induce them not only to renew fighting against the Germans but even to accept allied co-operations and assistance including that of Japan. We do not consider this to he inconsistent with supporting such non-Bolshevik elements in any part of Russia as are clearly determined to resist influence of Germany or Turkey.

Boratofif is trying in most suspicious manner to interfere with Dunster- ville’s arrangements with Bicharakoff and to interpose in a manner intended to win popularity with the Persians in questions pending between ourselves and Persia that do not concern him such as that of S. M. Mirza. He is now coming to Tehran, and I am convinced his idea is to offer his services with the Cossack Division to the Persian Government. As he would thus be wholly under control of Government and independent of Shah and Russian Minister present Cabinet would welcome opportunity of engaging him on contract. Shah, whom I have warned, has promised to veto any such arrangement, and I propose to take the earliest opportunity to intimate to Baratoff that His Majesty’s Government would not improbably find it useless to continue payment of division in the event contemplated. A similar hint will be given to the Russian Officers of Division in order to thwart Baratoff from engineering an incident such as resulted in Clerget’s departure, vide my telegram No. 111.

Armenians at Tabriz according to His Majesty’s Consul, Tabriz, are convinced that they have retaken Erzeroum. I regard the news however as unreliable as its source seems to be Resht.

Following suggestions were made to French Minister and myself by the British and French Consuls at Tabriz in a telegraphic conversation this morning. ... ^ We should endeavour to bring about peace between Persians and Jelus so as to protect Christians of Urumia, etc., and oppose Turkish advance. This might be achieved by active propaganda among Persian officials and with those members of anti-ally parties at Tabriz who fear Turkish advance. Subsidies will have to be given to Jelus and foreign officers sent to command them. Russian Consul-General had been asked by Governor if he could arrange for Russian officers. ’ &gt; Apart from Jelus forces available consit of 3,000 armed Armenians, 1,200 Persian Cossacks and some Persian troops of little military value. For all these purposes large sums of money are required—to begin with say from two hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand tomans. There is plenty of cash in the bank, but it would be impossible to convey money to the jelus, till relations are established between them and the Persians. As German Consul is expected to arrive with big supplies of money, early action is necessary. Our reply was that you had been authorised to assist Jelus with money and officers if feasible, that conduct of our work m those regions was apparently in your hands and that recommendations would be referred to you. Consul was encouraged by us to induce Governor to propose necessity for co-operation with Jelus to his Government to oppose Turks. If proposal came from him we might be able to do something at this end. We pointed out that employment with Cossacks was problematical, as Persian Government was most unwilling to become involved in overt war with Turks. Other items are— -—^ • - ' ~ ~ ~ No British officer could get to Urumia till settlement of Jelu question. Presence of a few Turks at Zanjan is reported by Sandes of Imperial Bank of Persia.

Consul, Tabriz, sends following repeated Dunsterville:— Begins. May 9th. Nouri Pasha arrived with 30 Turkish officers and men yesterday. There is some scepticism as to his being a brother of Enver Bey. Some Persian officer of Cossack Brigade who called on them was told that they belong to the General Staff of a Turkish army 15,000 strong, which has Kars, Erivan and the annexation to Turkey of the Mussalman regions of Caucasus, vid Ardebil, Astara and Baku, as its objectives. They consider Azerbaijan as belonging to Turkey. Kussian Consul- Gereral, however, thinks that old frontier west of lake of Urumia is meant. According to their statements only the General Staff with requisite personnel would oome to Tabriz which would be its headquarters and theyhad no hostile intentions against any body who did not interfere with them or their object* On the other hand, the French Consul was again told by the Governor-General this morning that Nouri Pasha would only stay a few days. It is now reported that Yali Ahd has changed his mind, and said that as he did not leave when the Russians came he would not ( ? on ? arrival of) Turkish troops ( ? now). 1 am told by my French colleague on the other hand that His Highness yesterday violently abused the Turks to him. Cossack Brigade has been ordered not to leave on any account. Since General Karpoff left Julfa two days ago with his staff there has been no wireless news from Tiflis though some Armenian wireless operators were left there. The French and United States* Consuls and Armenians and many Persians now show a tendency to regard the Turkish menace on Azerbaijan as bluff. On the other hand the Russian Consul-General is pessimistic still. All I can say is that if Turks want to come Persians are much too feeble and split up in cliques to offer resistance.

It is based chiefly on Armenian information which cannot be depended upon in the present state of Armenian feeling. Governors mentioned have done nothing more than forward escaped prisoners of war. In the present state of affairs this is only to be expected. I received a letter yesterday from the Chief of Bujnurd in which he promises to send any such prisoners here in future, to inform me of the despatch and to instruct the men escorting them not to offer resistance to British troops coming out to take over prisoners. Arms spoken of were purchased by Governor of Kuchan from the Cossack regiment which had passed through Kuchan some time ago. Thev have h^en acquired for general purposes.

In order to oppose General Dutov who, with Ural Cossacks, is said to be advancing from Orenburg, the Bolsheviks have sent the greater part of the force from Bokhara and reinforcements from Samarkand with artillery from both places, towards Tashkent. Trans-Caspian Turcomans have also been enlisted for this purpose at high rates of pay. Conflict at Baku has now given rise to tension in Trans-Caspian.

Por the information and reassurance of the Persian public it is announced :— 7l) The British Government, although it has up to the present been unwilling t° &amp;en( i troops into Persian territory, is now compelled by circumstances to despatch thereto an adequate force. (2) The ultimate object of the despatch of this force is confined to the circumvention of the operations and intrigues of the enemy which have recently been the cause of so much trouble to the British Government and so much damage to the Persians. So far the Persian Government has been unable to put a stop to these acts of aggression, and the British Governmentis therefore adopting this measure in order to prevent the machinations of the enemy from producing in Persia an even more unpleasant state of affairs than at present. It should be enough to remind the people of Persia of the behaviour of the Turks, who ^ devastated the country from Hamadan to Qasr-i-Shirin so effectually that it will be a long and difficult task to restore the population of that tract to their former condition. (3) Since the British Government desires that Persia should be independ ent and progressive, it intends to withdraw from Persian territory, before the end of the war if possible, and in any event upon the conclusion of peace, the troops which in the present state of war it is despatching. The continuance of the British Army in Persia thus depends upon the time occupied in suppress ing the hostile operations and intrigues with which the Persian Government has for some time past been unable to cope. (4) ^ As regards the sacred faith of Islam, it is unnecessary to say more than that which all the world knows, namely, that the British Government holds itself bound at all times and in all places duly to honour that holy religion and that in the present case also it will observe every respect towards it. (5) The British Government offers every assurance that there shall he no interference with the property and possessions of the Persian people on the part of the troops; further that Government is anxious to avoid as far as possible any intrusion into the official concerns of the Persian Government, and Persian Government officials should therefore behave in a properly friendlv manner. J (p) Although the British Army is provided witfi all things in the way of supplies and so forth ordinarily requisite for its march and does not require outside assistance, yet the troops will pay to the owner the fair price, fully ttim 11 c 1 a8 ^’ an y thing which they may chance to purchase from Persians. Unlike the Turks, whose oppressions and exactions are notorious, the British troops will treat the inhabitants with sympathy and consideration and will to the best of their power show themselves anxious for their well-beino*; and it is oth fitting and essential that the Chiefs of tribes and districts, whose pioper task it is to see that the peace is kept, should issue strict orders for the preservation of complete tranquillity in places occupied bv British troops. (?) policy is directed towards the maintenance of order and the establishment of justice. At the present juncture a British Army is entering Persian territory in pursuance of objects which the British Government, the Persian Government and others have in common; and it will treat the inhabitants with every consideration. In return for all this, the British Government expects of the governors, all and severally, of the gentrv, of the tnbes, m fane of each and every individual Persian, that they will ‘treat the British soldiery in a friendly manner and refrain from molesting them. In ease of such molestation by any class of persons whatever, the British troops will be compelled to take the firmest measures for their punishment and sup pression. further, any person caught spying will be punished according to R. L. Kenkion, Lieutenant-Colonelt British Consul, Kerman shah.t 47 L If) Am O O 918 Telegram P., No. X.-7681, dated the 1st (received 2nd) April 1918.

A scheme Government of Bakhtiaris by a committee believed to have been put forward by Mujahid-Shahab and other motives for this are as follows;— (1) To share revenue. (2) To weaken influence exerted by Minister through his appointment of Illkkanis. (3) To weaken authority of Illkhani. This was opposed by Illkhani and Illbegi who are supported by Asad and . c , Jang both now at Tehran. Reported by y one c ange. Minister* that Khans in Tehran show hostile attitude to us on the whole, but Illkhani should easily keep hostile elements in check if we support him.

My answer would be that our assistance would take the form of allowing aeroplanes to destroy rebel forts. Destruction of fort at Ahmadi, flight of 18 miles, might be necessary. Further resistance would be improbable thereafter in sphere of lower road and I believe the effect would suffice to enable Governor-General to deal effectively with upper part of road. In view of present movement of troops it seems very desirable to have an alternative route for supply to shipping in order to relieve probable con gestion at Bunder Abbas. The proposal to use planes has now been accepted in principle by Minister and Cox {vide his telegram No. 179, January 8th). If you concur can aeroplanes be made available as soon as Minister considers opportunity has arrived ? I have not yet mentioned matter to Gough owing to uncertainty of whether planes can be procured. 53 Telegram P., No. 354-S., dated the 6th April 1918 : .

Intelligence Officer, Kasvin, sends following:— Begins. According to St. Chekin Bolsheviks are losing power in Baku proper (?); town will be soon in hands of Mussalmans who are under German influence. There aife some 3,000 Turks and many Germans in Caucasus,' with secret' Committees everywhere. There are no formed German troops nearer than Odessa. There are three disciplined Russian Mussalman regiments within reach of Baku with about 60,000 armed Mussalmans whom the Germans can organise. The Armenians are about 15,000 strong, better armed and organised than the Mussalmans as they have guns and machine guns. Germans trying to get hold of Black Sea Fleet but appear so far to have got a few only. Similar efforts on our part failed. There are Turkish regular forces along Trebizond coast to 20 versts from Batoum; the only bands near ing Tiflis were about 60 versts away. He feared Turks would leave Batoum and occupy Tiflis. So far Pan-Islamism has not taken great hold of people. Shahseven tribe had broken with Kuchik Khan and driven his men from Ardebil and Astara, and 400 left him from Resht. Zugmayer and Committee with Kuchik Khan in jungle. According to St. Chekin the Caucasian Mussalmans at heart prefer the Russians to Turks, and a show of force at Kasvin and Enzeli is all that is required to prevent growth of Pan-Islamism, f Three hundred British troops at Kasvin and 1,000 at Rnzeli would hearten pro-British and orderly element of Caucasus to oppose our enemies and would prevent growth of hostile strength. This must be done very quickly however or threat to Persia will grow enormously.

Party of British and Americans left Tiflis for Baku and Krasnovodsk; of these 8 or 9, probably including Durie, were taken from the train. I I am sending Scott to Kasvin to-day to obtgin further information of Caucasian situation from St. Chekin. Mr. Doolittle is starting for Tiflis to-day. This refers to my telegram No. 283.

Utmost capital will be made of any German successes and anti-British party will have intelligent and active guidance as long as Wassmuss is at large.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To-His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Shah was until recently contemplating calling on Samsam-us-Sultaneh or Ain-ed-Dowleh to take office owing to the extreme weakness of the Cabinet. During the Naruz holiday however Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik made a bid for Bakhtiari support by offering them another seat in Cabinet and the Governor- slnps of Ispahan, Luiistan, Kermanshah and Yezd. Ispahan to go to Murtaza (?) Kuii Khan Samsam-us-Sultaneh’s son, a most undesirable appointment. The Khans who are nibbling at this attractive proposal would defend their action to us if they accepted on the ground that they joined Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik to exercise a moderating influence on him while calculating that on the formation of a more friendly Cabinet they can appeal to the ancient friendship between the tribe and Great Britain to preserve their Governorship, which would be very embarrassing. My efforts are devoted to prevent this combination, Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik’s offer however makes the formation of a Cabinet by Samsam-us-Sultaneh with approval of his kinsmen and our countenance difficult, as he must enviously be in a position to offer big inducements to them. He would certainly bargain for his son getting the Governorship of Ispahan. r If increasing hostility of present Cabinet makes it necessary to brino* about its fall, we may therefore have to have recourse to Ain-ed-Dowleh to carry us over for the next few weeks until the formation of more amenable Cabinet is possible on the arrival of our troops. He would do nothing to improve the situation though would serve to tide over an awkward gap. Naturally enough Shah is unwilling to see such a great increase of Bakhtiari influence but is too weak for his resistance to count much. India will please repeat to Baghdad, Ispahan, Shiraz and the latter will please inform Sykes.

From—H[is Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. It is reported by His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz that an application has been made through Kussian Consul-General at Tabriz Tor tomans 1,00,000, by the Russian Officer Commmffiihg 4*00 Nestorian Levies, Jinown as Jelus, nt TJrumia. The Officer Commanding states that his force is impaired and its ammunition almost exhausted, and that the levies will have to return to Van unless these are furnished. They were originally raised in Turkey and were brought into Persia on the withdrawal of the Russian troops. The Battalion which attacked Persian Cossacks near Urumia (my telegrams Nos. lOd, 167 and 188) and committed other excesses, especially since Mar Shimon’s murder (my telegram No. 249) if not actually part of these levies, is a similar formation and their withdrawal would be fraught with danger of reprisals on the Christians of Urumia and the neighbourhood. Hence it seems necessary to furnish the money. On the other hand, it is practically impossible to send so large sum from Tabriz to Urumia with out the Persian Government’s energetic cooperation, and the Persian Govern ment’s one wish is to secure the withdrawal of the Jelus ; they have indeed addressed requests on the subject to the Allied Legations. His Majesty’s Consul, however, has heard confidentially from his Russian colleague, that the disbandment of the Jelus has been decided by the Tiflis staff. Whether they will obey orders or let their Russian officers leave them, seems to him however doubtful. Apparently the idea of the Russiari Officer Commanding is that if he can get the money, he and his officers, of whom there are about 40, may manage to escape. Though good fighters in their own mountains the Jelus are quite undiscip lined ; and unless British officers come to take them over, as they have been led to'believe* the probability is that they would make their way back to their homes in the Julamark district and defend themselves as in the past against the Turks. Instructions are solicited. There is more than sufficient money lying with Imperial Bank of Persia at Tabriz (group undecypberable) which has (been) sent no directions. Com munications between two cities are broken again. I am informed by French Minister that he has obtained permission for his Government for the recall of the French Sanitary Mission which has been working in Urumia.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Simla. Scott has obtained following information from St. Chiken who left Baku March 31st afternoon. Fighting broke out two hours after his departure. A big victory was scored by social revolutionaries and Armenians over Mussalmans who got severe lesson. Apcording to a later and probably reliable report fighting was still going on April 7th. Conditions were anarchical. Boats are no longer running between Enzeli and Baku A steamer hnd been sent up from Fnzeli to Astrakan to find out whether Russian troops could be repatriated by that route. On March 26th, nine Englishmen were arrested at Ellizavitpol, description of one of whom seems to fit Durie. It is thought tliat the others are mining engineers, not Pike or his party, who are almost certainly under arrest at Tiflis.St. Chiken offered to help Pike to get away, but he said he would he ac- quitted(?;. As an illustration of the strong anti-British feeling amongst Tartars, a German officer at Ellizavitpol was nearly killed by local Moslems because he was thought to be English. A letter from Goldsmith, dated lidis, Morch 27th, was received by iViaedonnell at Baku asking him to engage rooms at Baku for March 30th. Macdonnell sent a messenger to Ellizavitpol apparently on March 30th. He had hot returned by afternoon of March 31st however. At present the men in power at Tiflis are two pro-Germans, one the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Chenkavy ?) and the other the Minister of War, supported by a large Moslem clique. Gegechkori is neutral and powerless. Prjevalsky is virtually a prisoner. From the national military formations nothing is to be hoped for. Large numbers of Tartars in Caucasus would like to come back under a restored Kussian Imperial regime; their present leaders are pro*German however. At the head of the secret pro- German Tartar Committee which works at Tiflis and Baku, are (1) Jevanshir, (2) Vazireff, (3) Ras ul-Zadah and (4) Narimanoff. (1), (2) and (3) are all members of Caucasian Diet; (2) is particularly dangerous. They are largely financed by l agieff, wealthy resident of Baku. At the beginning of April the Moslems and Georgians (Ajars) who live in Baku district were neutral. It is the desire of the Tartar leaders of Caucasus to hawe the Whole of Azerbaijan and p^rt of Northern Gilan join them under a Turkish Protectorate. ‘They started negotiations with Persian Democratic Committee at Tabriz with this object some three weeks ago. The latter objected however and sent a delegation to Tiflis to protest against the inclusion of Persian territory. Tartar Committee also sent a representative Narulieff to negotiate with Kuchik Khan. Zagmayer arrived simultaneously at Resht. Kuchik Khan accepted their money and promised to help the Tartars against British; he refused entirely however to agree to Azerbaijan (being joined to ?) Tartary. He tried to send a .detachment to Meshidiser to extend his influence there but met with no success. The social revolutionaries at Baku control the one regiment (6th), the aviation school, and the Caspian War fleet (with sailors on board), consisting of “Sier 0, Tepe ”, an old vessel which is under an obligation to stay 6 months at Ashturada to protect community there; two modern vessels called “ Ardekan ” and “Kars” and the “ Krasnevodsk Tartars are trying to buy this fleet for 1,000,000 roubles. St. Chiken is in favour of the social revolutionaries, as comprising the best Russian element and because with our assistance they might be able to co-ordinate with the 5,000,000 Russians in Caucasus, obtain support of a large section of Tartars and work out policy based on Russian national lines. He will give (Clutterbuck ?) the names of men we can work through. The German intention is to bring about a revolution in North Persia, as soon as possible, preferably in Tehran, but failing that wherever they can in the north. Our assistance must be given as soon as ever it is possible. Two hundred men in Kasvin would encourage social revolutionaries and have great effect.* It would be magnified at Baku into several thousands. This is the gist of St. Chiken’s report. Owing to impossibility of returning to his post at present United States Vice-Consul, Tiflis, is remaining in Tehran. This refers to my telegram, 283.

The Persian Government in Pars is not only showing open hostility by telegraph orders and letters of Mukbar-es-Sultaneh, but is inciting the Kashgais and other tribes to cause disorders and attack caravans. It seems desirable to point out the heavy strain which is now being placed on the loyalty of the South Persia liifles (130th ?) officers and men are being got at incessantly and if this continues for long, it will be impossible not to feel anxious. However, on the other hand, landowners and others appreciate the benefits conferred on'by us, and Par man Parma is, generally speaking, on our side, although frightened/ The military position is safe, but, unless repudiation of South Persia Rifles by Persian Government is cancelled, or other corrective action taken, I fear South Persia Rifles desertions, perhaps on a large scale, with rifles. Vith the exception that he considers Parman Parma absolutely on our side, this is agreed to bv the Consul. ° J 67a V - ' Telegram P., No. nil, dated the 6th (received 7th) April 1918.

I have been advised that the death sentence under military law can be passed for desertion only if the convicted person is on active service, and I am not sure whether men belonging to the South Persia Rifles can be’technically considered as being on active service. As to this point it would be well to obtain an authoritative ruling. So long as the situation here is still doubtful I deprecate execution from a political point of view, but provided that sentence is pronounced to be legal I should see no objection as soon as the advance of our troops has made things here secure. b 'UWtv* |j i 68 Telegram P., No. 293, dated the 10th (received 11th) April 1918.

From—The General Officer Commanding, South Persia Rifles, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. r The following is the evidence :— . M Warnings have been received by pro-British in Southern Persia who are intimidated and frightened. Mukhbir-us-Sultanah, who was educated in Berlin ard is strongly pro-German, is openly mentioned as the source of all orders against British and South Persia Rifles. (it) According to information from two sources the pro-German Paqr-us- Sultanah, now at Tehran and a protegd of Persian Government, wrote to La shams to attack and oppose British and South Persia Rifles promising them the Persian Government s support and also arms, ammunition, and money from Tehran. This information is borne out by the fact that the Persian Government has instructed Karguzar, Shiraz, and that Shiraz has called mv attention to acts and damage done by South Persia Rifles especially against Lashanis in last autumn operations. ^ o (Hi) Robberies of posts and travellers near Khaneh Zinian been traced to village ? ? which belongs to Eaqr-us-SuItanah. Even barman barma believes the r Lberies were instigated by Eaqr-us- Sultanah. ^ (iv) When a big caravan was attacked by Lashanis and Meshedi Jani Khan Arabs at Tangi Kamin in December 191 , the camels of various owners were released except camels of owners carrying barley for South Persia Rifles. There had been no previous trouble between South Persia Rifles and these Arabs. These owmers were told by the Arabs that orders from Tehran were to harry the South Persia Rifles and that this was the reason why these camels were not given back. Burmese Mounted Rifles and South Persia Rifles attacked these Arabs lust January, recovering many of these identical camels, South Persia Rifles grain bags and the boots of the South Persia Rifles sowar killed at Tangi Kamin. There is no doubt that this robbery was engineered for political purposes. (t?) Soulat (?) has written to certain friends in Shiraz mentioning that he was sore perplexed as his orders from Tehran were to harry the South Persia Rifles whereas he had no wish to be at enmity with them or the British. These letters have been read out to me. * * i (vi) Robberies on main roads had practically ceased during last six months in 1917 and robberies are not usual in winter in Pars. In December it was rumoured all over Pars that the Persian Government and Mukhber-’is- Sultana in particular were instructing tribes to oppose the British to treat the South Persia Rifles as enemy to Persia and to harry them. Prom Christmas to end of February six attacks were made in Pars by tribesmen in bodies one hundred to two hundred strong. Tribesmen have not attacked caravans before in such force. (vii) Persian Government sent Persian officials both at Kerman and Shiraz instructions about Christmas not only not to recognise South Persia Rifles officially but to obstruct them actively in every way. These instruc tions are being observed.n (viii) There is law and order and no starvation in the South Persia Kifles sphere. In North Persia people are dying of starvation. Official orders to Pars and Kerman have been issued by Mukhber-us-Sultana to stop all forward purchasing under severe penalties. This order is unnecessary and can only be intended as deliberate obstruction of South Persia Rifles. Difficulties in obtaining supplies by ordinary methods are already being experienced, the supply contractors and landowners acknowledging they are afraid to sell Requisitioning may become necessary. (ix) Virulent anti-Briiish and anti-South Persia Rifles newspaper articles pamphlets, circulars and telegrams emanate from Tehran. All Persian in Kerman and Pars universally assume the tacit approval of the Persian Government. (x) Acting under orders from Persian Government Farman Parma has stopped all written communications between Persian officers and South Persia Rifles since Christmas, which date coincides suspiciously with era of attacks by tribesmen. You are being addressed by Consul regarding urgency of giving Farman Parma definite written assurance. It seems essential that he should feel safe at this juncture in acting whole-heartedly with us. This is with reference to your telegram No. 14, dated 12th. Addressed Tehran ; repeated Chief of the General Staff. 85 Telegram P., No. 300, dated the 13th (received 15th) April 1918.

The present Cabinet must, there-' lore, be turned out and I propose to obtain audience and urge the Shah to dismiss it. I propose as an inducement to give him assurances as to pension in the event of his having to leave the country on lines suggested in my tele- gram 469 of December 22nd, and sanctioned in your telegram 365 on condition that he brings in a Cabinet pledged to oppose Jangalis and maintain friendly relations with us. J We must supply money to keep new Cabinet going. It will only be a stop-gap and will probably be headed by Samsam-us-Sultaneh. For this purpose there will be available tomans 100,000 due by Indo-European Tele graph Department from receipt of pay which Director has delayed at my request for some weeks His Majesty’s Government would presumably authorise resumption of moratorium on old terms pending discussion of new arrangement, and if necessary an advance.

Wilson, Officiating Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. With reference to this Office Memorandum No. 4344, ISth March, I have the honour to enclose, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a memorandum which I have prepared for the consideration of the General Officer Commanding in Chief in Mesopotamia regarding Political and Tribal Development in Pusht-i-Kuh. POLITICAL AND TRIBAL DEVELOPMENTS IN ARABISTAN FROM JULY 1917 TO DATE. The Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh has throughout the war been a doubtful quantity : he is ignorant and bigoted and his personal sympathies are admitted- ly with the Turks. If things had gone wrong with us in 1915 he would no doubt have joined them and was doubtless in the anticipation of some sush development that he came to Aiwan-i-Karkheh near Shush in March 1915 with a considerable following; the victory at Shaiba and the flight of the Turks opposite Ahwaz decided him to return. It was generally believed that he was then only prevented from committing himself by the advice and threats of certain pro-English or clearer headed elements amongst his adherents and relations. His attitude towards the Persian Government is not easy to analysehe pays no taxes and obeys no orders which do not suit his convenience, but be regards himself nevertheless as a patriotic servant of his country and as warden of its frontier. During 1915-16 he repeatedly received Turkish Missions and late in 1913 gave a German officer and 9 Turks safe conduct through his territories. His attitude has been a chronic source of incon venience and sometimes of anxiety to us and neither we nor the Persian Gov ernment owe him any consideration. The latter, though receiving unlimited assistance from us, is unable in spite of repeated requests to exercise any influence or control over the semi- hostile feudatory. We are therefore entitled to ignore her&gt; if military exi gencies should make this course desirable and to deal with the Wali ourselves. IVe have, however, hitherto maintained correct relations with the Wali and hope to be able to continue to do so. It has, however, been fairly clear from the first that under no circumstances would he give us active support,, and it has been made fairly clear in the course of negotiations with him that even were he to agree to maintain a benevolent neutrality and refuse Turkish troops passage, he would not in practice resent Turkish pressure. In June the Wali sent to Baghdad a deputation consisting of his relative Parhad Khan and Ezra Hardun, a Jewish trader many years’ resident in Pusht-i-Kuh whom we have been employing as a gobetween ourselves and the Wali since the beginning of the war. The arrival of this deputation afforded a convenient opportunity for gauging the Wali’s real feelings. ¥p till then all evidence had been that he was a bigoted Muhammadan with pro- Turk leanings, who while he just kept in with us had always been benevolent in his neutrality towards the Turks. Meanwhile we were receiving continual reports from various headmen of Pusht-i-Kuh to the effect that they were ready to oust the Wali in favour of his son, who also made overtures to us. 1 ' WEzra Hardun took a tentative draft of the conditions we should require as a basis of an agreement with the Wali, designed not so much in the hope that he would subscribe to them as to elicit from him a statement of what he . arrived at getting from us. The Wali procrastinated and evaded replying for some weeks but continued to correspond with the Germans. Ezra Hardun despairing of any result from the Wali, then decided in accordance with his instructions to sound Amanullah Khan who readily signed the draft terms which the Wali had found inacceptable. By desire of the General Officer Commanding in Chief the matter was not pursued : it is, however, useful to know that should the Wali give serious trouble we have a rival party in the country headed by his son, who will be glad to oppose and oust him if supported by us. * During November and December 1917 a number of incidents took place in and near Mendali tending to show that the Wali v resented our occupation of that place. A local bandit Kerim Gurda, an adherent of the Wali, was active in looting sheep on their way to our troops, and in committing other minor depredations: Arab tribes near Mendali were attacked by Pusht-i-Kuh tribes, etc. Our answer to this was to despatch an Assistant Political Officer to Badrah, where the Wali possesses (without adequate title) valuable lands, with orders, amongst other matters, to investigate the Wali’s title to various gardens and not to admit ownership unless fully proved : to claim taxes from the Wali as from others, and generally to exert a little mild pressure. The result justified anticipations. The Wali sent a sum of money in compensation for the Mendali robberies, promised to restrain Karim Gurda (he has been as good as his word up to date) and made certain requests: these, together with the replies thereto, are attached. With the impending occupation of Kermanshah and Hamadan the question of the Wali may assume fresh prominence : it may be taken for granted that he will not like our presence there : that he will actively resent it, unless the Persian situation undergoes a radical change, is equally improbable. The best way to checkmate any pro-Turkish inclinations he may show would appear to be to bring pressure to bear on him at Badrah. It is possible that to do this effectively might involve a demand for a detach ment of troops there. A small force could easily be supplied at Badrah, and it is within the bounds of possibility that the Kut-Badrah-Kermanshah route might by this means be made available for the despatch of military stores to Kermanshah which is roughly equi-distant from Badrah and Khanikin.

It is long since I have received any intelligence of the welfare of your honourable and esteemed personality. I have been all along expecting your honour to favour me with friendly correspondence, but so far I have not been very fortunate in this respect. Khwaja Ezra, British Consul, has a mind to pay his respects to your honour and I dare sending this humble note through him. I trust by His grace you are in the best enjoyment of health, prosperity and happiness, and hope that unlike the past practice you would afford honour and happiness to this faithful well-wisher of yours by informing him of the welfare of your respectable personality and by giving him opportunity to do any service.•5^ *&gt; ^ * / As regards myself, I am well and all the circumstances by His grace and your kind attention are quite satisfactory. I laid some requests before your honour through Khwaja Ezra, the British Consul, but I haye received no reply to them as yet. I am waiting for the reply and the favourable result. Copy of memorandum from the Civil Commissioner to Gulam Reza Amir Jang, Wali of Puskt-i-Kuh, No. 3800—67/11, dated the 4th March 1918. cc X was very pleased to receive your friendly letter by the hand of Ezra Saleh Hardun. It is true that it is a long time since we exchanged letters, but since we came to Baghdad I have been much preoccupied. I am glad now to have an opportunity of sending you a letter by M. Mirza regarding your affairs. «&lt; regards the garden of the late Shaikh Namus, I understand that Your Excellency paid for it the sum of £T. 365. The Turkish authorities had no right to sell, as Haji Namus was a prisoner with us, and I do not like that you should be the loser and I have therefore instructed Hardun to pay the amount and take your receipt. a re gards the revenue due on your gardens at Zorbatieh and Badrah, on my making enquiries I find that the Turks have not taken revenue from Your Excellency during these years of the war. In the same way during these years of the war, we shall not take the revenue, and I will arrange with the Bevenue Department accordingly. “ As regards Arabs whose flocks graze in your limits, thelboundary between the territory of PushM-lKuh and Iraq is well known to all. If the Arab fiocks cross over the boundary and are certified by my Agent as having done so, then you have the right to take the grazing fees, according to past practice. If they do not pay, they must leave your suburbs. “As regards the gardens of the sons of the late Haji Judi, Your Excellency is aware that the officials of the British Government move by rule. If before the war you have obtained the gardens on mortgages certified in the books of the Turks, will you please send them to me, so that they can be compared with Government boohs apd after that we will discuss it and I will give you an answer ? ” 100 No. 4903—67/6, dated Baghdad, the 21gt March Received 6th April) 1918.

I am anxious to see Khans here instead of at Kamuz, because Young thinks if they are disappointed on account of the two guns on which they have set their heart they may abandon expedition and leave for north in disgust. If they stay here as guests of Sheikh, it will be more easy to pacify them and perhaps induce them to tackle Kuhgiiu without guns. The intentions of the lllkhani are rather obscure at present; Minister telegraphs that there is a movement on foot promoted by Jllkhani and supported by Mohtasham and Jang to replace A&amp;bja by Shahab-us-Sultaneh and Minister asks me to avoid anything calcul ated to impede it.

I wired to Consul-General, Ispahan, on March 15th asking him what action he had taken in the matter vis-a-vis Minister. He replied that he had been unable to persuade the Minister to take i bis view. The Minister’s point was that the loan of guns to Zafar would offend the Khans in ^ Tehran.

South Persm Rifles m my opinion would in any case have to be stittened by regulars. I also regard raising additional levies for South PersiaRifles at Ispahan of doubtful expediency. It would be many months before they could be made efficient and trustworthy, and half-trained men might become dangerous rather than safe. Again Russian feeling would very much resent appearance of South Persia Rifles so long as there are Persian Cossacks under Russian Officers at Ispahan, and it is important to keep Russian Officers of Cossack Division in Tehran loyal. 137 to Telegram P., No. 2638 (2636), dated the 21st (received 22nd) March 1918. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- « ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Minister ) Doctor Young sends following from Oil-fields March 19th, with reference Minister’s telegram 6, March 8th, a copy of which has not reached me Begins .—I am surprised that Zafar did not even mention Shahab in the conversation I had with him a few days ago on the whole Bakhtiari situation. There is no question of secrecy between us in such matters, and lean only con clude that he could not have taken his own proposals seriously. The Illkhani and the Illbegi appear getting on very well together and I wonder whether Zafar would not be better off with his sleeping partner Ashja than with Shahab who is sure to be led by his brother-in-law Murtaza Kuli Khan. Would it not be possible to induce the latter to remain in Tehran ? His hostility to us is notorious even among the tribes. Murtaza, supported by Mujtahid, Shahab ana all other junior Khans, has promoted a scheme to carry on Bakhtiari Govern ment by means of a Committee. The true motives were (1) to divide the revenue among the anywise important; (2) to undermine the Minister’s influence in appointing Illbegi; (3) to undermine Illbegi’s authority. I regard this move as dangerous to British interests in general and to Oil-fields in particular, as it may provide an attractive field for enemy agents, and sooner or later must end in the disappearance of all authority in the country. The Tehran Khans have declared in favour of it, and it was partly in order to obtain approval of scheme that Murtaza and Sbahab went to Tehran. Zafar seems to have been , . , ,, led to (?) Ashja solely in order to* turned •Groups undecipherable. ou| . ^ J Murtaza . Wou]d j t not do if some promise was obtained from Shahab in the matter ? As Shahab had already enlisted our support, it is a pity that we were not informed of this move before. I personally dislike Ashja and I hold no brief for him but his influence with the tribes is greater than Shahab’s, and if let loose could do more damage. On account of his democratic views and relations with Murtaza he would be more troublesome to Zafar who I fear is being misled by his brother. From my knowledge of tribal susceptibility and a survey of the situation as it presents itself here I cannot help feeling that a change in Illbegiship would be inopportune.

Following is substance, paragraphs being numbered for convenience of reference. 1. Persian Government have repeatedly protested against military aggres sion of belligerents in Persia. They regard present action of^ His Majesty’s Government in replacing Eussian troops by British and in maintaining Southern Persia Eifles as contrary to promises of Great Britain to respect in dependence and neutrality of Persia. They request withdrawal of troops. 2. Gratification is expressed in regard to promise of revision of tariff and to support given, but Persia ask me to withdraw her recognition of 1807 agree ment. 3. As regards offers from a neutral country for contemplated uniform Police force, they object to condition that selection should be determined by agreement between the two Governments as infringing the right Persian Government resumes on abrogation of ultimatum of 1911 and as confirming “ such other pernicious agreements.’* 4. They demand unconditional participation in Peace Conference on the ground that Persia unlike other neutrals has suffered losses through operations of belligerents.5. They express regret for arrest of Vice-Consul and Bank Manager at Besht—release they are endeavouring to effect but they hold British Military authorities responsible because they arrested Sulleiman Mirza on Persian soil. 6. As regards financial assistance they consider they have the right to that asked for in note of Pebruary 1st,(see point 5 of my telegram 80 of Feb ruary 3rd) and they hope that it will be paid. 7. In conclusion note states that Persian Government feel confident that with the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in meeting their reasonable wishes they will succeed in maintaining their neutrality and preserving order in the interior. Telegram P., No. 241, dated the 21st (received 22nd) March 1918. Prom—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; repeated to Dunsterville, Hamadan and Baghdad.) Persian note is somewhat uncompromising in its general tone. A new prepared not merely agree to Persia’s withdrawal of her recognition of 1907 Convention but to scrap whole of the points of 1911 ultimatum. Persia’s unconditional participation in Peace Conference is insisted upon (paragraph 4). It virtually declines suggestion that nationality of officers of future uniform force shall be matter of agreement between the two Governments. It finally (paragraph 6) renews its unreasonable demands unmodified as regards excess receipts of Southern customs house retained by Imperial Bank of Persia. There is no sign whatever of a conciliatory spirit, and the same may be said of other communications from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, protesting against first forward movement of troops. What the Cabinet’s line will be it Cabinet is prepared to go to lengths where the two brothers cannot follow. I have been sent word by the Shah that he is prepared to dismiss Cabinet, and that he wishes to appoint Ain-ed-Dowleh who according to my information would form Ministry no more (friendly ?) than the present one. Vosuk-ed- Dowleh however professes to be ready to accept office, and I am endeavouring to induce the Shah to send for him. It thus looks a* if the Cabinet were near its fall, and as if being aware of this, extremists are endeavouring to induce the Jangalis to make a coup de main first on Kasvin and then on Tehran. 300 of them are reported to be at Manjil. Best informed opinion here is practically unanimous that they will not attempt such a coup but it is not impossible that they may be persuaded to do so by extremist assurances of support in Tehran, in the shape of gendar merie Mujahids, Bakhtiari sowars, Comitadji (?) and Turkish soldiers. There are said to be 150 Mausers in Austrian Legation and several rounds (?) of ammunition. (Groups undecypherable) Operations (?) made west of Kasvin. The Shah however would not permit employment of Cossacks for this purpose as he insists on keeping them in Tehran for his own protection. Our own forces are still too far off to prevent a resolute (?) coup. This refers to my immediately preceding telegram. This is with reference to your telegram No. 213. 142 * Paragraph 3 ? pretension is even put forward, in that it assumes (paragraph 4*) that we are is difficult to foretell.

This step has been forced upon us by German action in Persia which Persian Government have not prevented and are not in a position to prevent. 3. His Majesty’s Government have no designs on Persian independence and integrity, and troops will be withdrawn at end of war if not before. It is hoped that Persian people will realize that the step has been taken in their interests to prevent worse calamity. 4. Assurances to respect religion and sacred places. 5. Assurances to respect persons, property and institutions, and regarding our desire not to interfere in administration. Inhabitants will be treated with consideration and supplies will be paid for at fair rates. It is expected on the other hand that local authorities will preserve order wherever troops located. 6. As troops being sent in joint interests of ourselves and Persia it is expected that they will be met in a friendly spirit by Government, officials, tribes and peoples which will be reciprocated. Acts of hostility will, however, be punished. Ends. On March 16th His Majesty’s Minister replied that he approved terms of the proclamation provided General Officer Commanding concurred. 'Kennion telegraphed on March 19th urging that he be authorised to publish proclamation on above lines at once as British detachment was due to reach Kermanshah in a few days.

Operations .—The great importance of control of the Caspian has always re ceived my consideration, and several schemes for the achievement of that object have been framed by me. But any scheme must first depend on possession of port, and at present all ports are in control of Bolsheviks, Jangalis and Tartars. Our friends could probably secure gun-boats but these latter would be useless until we control Enzeli or our friends control Baku. I am talking to Bicharakoff with reference to Kuchik Khan affairs and would like him to establish himself in Enzeli. There is, however, a plot on the other side which I can only guess at. It .... . ,, is probably “ Pan-Islamic ”, the Tartart (2 groups undecipherable)* with Jangalis and German money and perhaps force behind them. The Tartars are quite the best people in the Caucasus so above is a strong combination. It is presumed the plot will come to a head when last of Russians are due to leave Enzeli about 8th April, and not much time to forestall them is left to us. 153 Telegram P., 306-S., dated the 23rd March 1918.

(2) At Manzil, some Caucasian Tartars and 300 Jangalis. (3) 100 Jangalis, 40 miles north of Kasvin.

Doolittle reports that owing to their cry to take from the rich and give to the poor, the Jangalis movement is growing daily. His impression is that possibly on March 27th they will certainly seize Kasvin. It is impossible to foresee the effect of this on Tehran, but there are all the elements here neces sary to produce revolution and disorder. Without the Persian Cossacks there is nothing to guard Leo-ation foreigners and bank and we cannot be absolutely certain of them.

He requires assistance two armoured cars and two aeroplanes. Agreement to be signed, and a month later on four armoured cars and eight with machine guns and four aeroplanes. Asks for five million krans or roubles whichever is more favourable at time of payment and ten million krans on successful conclusion of operations. I agree generally with his scheme, which would shorten ourresponsibility by 300 miles, whereas By holding as far as Hamadan only and letting Kasvin and Tehran fall into enemy hands we should leave North Persia free field for Germans. While seeing its weak points, I do not think better scheme could be evolved. Cost is high, but cost of restoring order in Persia if Jangalis movement succeed (afe it Will if hot immediately opposed) would be many times greater. Every day is important.

Arrival of British detachments in Kermanshah which have passed through was quietly received. Prices have risen in consequence. Governor of Kermanshah has lost all authority. No important change in the tribal situation. Tribes on Kasr-i-Shirin- Kermanshah road have been behaving well. Sardar Rashid, late Governor of Kurdistan, whose appointment made by the Russians was absurd, has returned to Juanrud finding his position impos sible. He and Jafir Sultan of Avroman are in communication with tribes in opposition (?) Sinjabis chiefly. There have been more defections from latter’s own people. There have been no hostilities between Turks and Kurdistan tribes. Detachment sent Halabja was apparently in view of reported British advance).

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla.' Bicharakoff clearly shares general Russian disloyalty and suspicion of British troops appearing in North Persia. Please reassure hirn on this score reminding him that we give Persia an assurance that our troops will be With drawn at end of war, and telling him that we have no intention of making political capital as against Russia or interfering with legitimate Russian interests. In my opinion great political importance attaches to continued entente With Russia. True, they cannot give us very much active assistance. Their open hostility, however, would greatly encourage Anglo-phobe Persian party here. Nor can we do anything to shake loyalty of Cossack division which has been our sole military asset Und without which situation here would have been exceedingly precarious. This 'we should do if we turned down Bicharakoff’s offer, and we should, therefore, try to come to reasonable terms with him. What his offer is worth I do not know. To me it seems clear that for next two months or until we have sufficient troops in North-West Persia to dominate the situation we ought to rally to us all the forces we can. Owing to mutilation of your telegram I cannot make out what his proposal actually is. Is he offering hia services vrith any troops he can collect like some mediaeval Chief of mercenaries? If so, his price seems high. What about Baratoff and Causacan Government ? Verv confidential. So little belief have I in anything Russian that I cannot help suspecting that Bicharakoff is just trying to make money out of us. This refers to your telegram G.-129.

Reference telegram to Marling from Foreign Office, No. 161 of 23rd March regarding suggestion that some of the Dunster Force officers should proceed to Bakhtiaristan to organise levies there.Telegram P., No. 269 ; dated the 1st (received 2nd) April 1918. Prom—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Urgent. It is necessary to influence Bakhtiari Chiefs individually as they are not acting in concert. Action with the Ulkhani and Ulbegi who are in Bakhtiaristan in Bam Hormuz region should be taken directly by Political Officer, Ahwaz (assisted by Doctor Young), who would report to us as fully as possible lines of his negotiations. His efforts should be directed to maintaining the Illkhani and lllbegi in power and to restraining Amir Mujahid’s mischievous intrigues, in which direction Shaikh of Mohammerah may have some influence. A loan of 300 rifles and two guns is suggested as a means of pleasing and supporting the Illkhani and keeping the Bakhtiari tribesmen occupied in south against Kuhgelus and away from Ispahan. Illkhani should be discouraged from hoping for Governorship of Ispahan for himself on the ground that it would create too great opposition from the other chiefs at present. The rest of the chief Khans are now in Tehran. Samsam-es-Sultaneh is involved in democratic movement and is greatly influenced by his son Murteza Kuli Khan a rabid pro-German. But he is avaricious and is not a democrat at heart and may be influenced by money. Sardar Mohtasham is 'bent on obtaining the Governorship of Ispahan and has combined temporarily with Murteza Kuli Khan to keep Sirdar Jang out of it. Mohtasham, who is avaricious and may do our bidding at a price, professes himself entirely our friend. Young Sirdar Assad is in the present Cabinet, and is one of the most active promoters of its resistance to a compromise with us. For some time past however he has professed his wusk to conform to our desires in tribal affairs. He is in close touch with Sirdar Jang who is a man of intractable disposition and has always professed and shown firm adherence to British. Latterly however he has apparently come much under the influence of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, who has offered him the Governorship of Ispahan. This he has declined on account of jealous opposition of Mohtasham and Murteza Kuli Khan and the other Khans. As he is not rich, we must help him with money and trust to his influence with Sirdar Assad to keep the latter in hand. Above explains general situation and covers first four points of your telegram. Point five. The two mountain guns are additional (vide General Officer Commanding, Baghdad’s telegram X.-76 1, March 30th, to War Office). v / The military value of these levies will he in the protection to the Oil fields which they will afford also to Marshall’s right flank, and to their effect oa Syke’s position at Ispahan should he move there. The primary factor in all these considerations is that we should do nothing to alienate the Bakhtiari Khans, who as you know are sensitive regarding outside interference, and are also powerful and independent. It, therefore, seems prudent that before we decide to send strange officers upon an unasked for errand we should prepare the way carefully, and I would submit that our first step should be to ascertain from the Khans what their views on the levies’ proposal would be. Dr. Young knows the Bakhtiari Khans better than any other officer immediately available. He resides in the Oil fields and would be a good intermediary to place before the Khans the advantages which they could derive from the levies, pecuniary military and political. a9 11 - Point six. In the event of this Cabinet going Samsam-es-Sultaneh is a possible candidate for premiership and he has already thrown out feelers for mv support. He might come in as a stop gap pending advance of our troops t)*Hamadan if 1 can obtain assurances regarding the composition of his Cabinet and the direction of his policy. Point seven. Illkhani demands tomans 50,000 for his journey south and Kuhgelu expedition. He has had tomans 5,000. Doctor Young might be able to say whether he would accept less. Point eight. I regard Sirdar Jang on the whole as straightest of the Klians. He has considerable influence in the tribe, and the expenses he incurred owing to his plan of going to Ispahan being frustrated gives us an excuse for offering money. We may have to go as high as tomans 20,000.' I think the best way to secure Bakhtiari tribes is to hold out expect ations to Sirdar Jang and Sirdar Mohtasham of lucrative Governorships such as Ispahan and Kerman through our support, conditionally on their undertak- i n o* to maintain the present Illkhani in power. With these three on our side we can afford to show coldness to Sirdar Assad, Samsam-es-Sultaneh being soothed with a little money. This refers to your telegram 175.

Main efforts should be made from Ahwaz to secure support of Illkhani and local Khans. We should give Illkhani guns and money liberally. Moment appears favourable for making definite offer to Sirdar Jang and perhaps Sirdar Mohtasham, but we shall have to be liberal. Ends.

Telegram P., No. X.-7639, dated the 31st March (received 1st April) 1918. From—The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D ”, Baghdad, To—The Secretary, War Office, London (repeated to India and Tehran). Dunsterville wires :— Begins. Bicharakoff considers the Enzeli-Kasvin- Tehran zone to be still under Russian control and he admits his primary aim to be the retention of this sphere on behalf of his own country whose interests now coincide with ours. Control of country between Qasr-i-Shirin and Hamadan to be in British hands. He considers it inadvisable for the British to operate near Tehran, Qum and roads south. He requires 2 aeroplanes and 2 armoured cars to assist him. An agreement to be signed and a month later 4 armoured cars with further aggregate (of ?) 8 with machine guns and 4 aeroplanes. He asks 5 million krans or roubles, whichever is more favourable, at time of (ap pointment) and 10 million krans when the operations have been successfully concluded. Ends. Dunsterville with local knowledge agrees with the plan which, in providing immediate armed opposition to Jangali enterprises in the direction of Kasvin and thence towards Tehran and Hamadan, is eminently advantageous. I have no great faith in the fighting value of Bicharakoff’s partisans, but as they number over 1,000 they have some (corruption) enormous value. He states that the road continues so bad that British troops sufficient to operate beyond Hamadan cannot reach Dunsterville until the end of May. I consider therefore that the price which Bicharakoff asks is worth paying. The sum represents, at present rate of exchange, approxi mately 23 lakhs, now and an additional 45| lakhs in case the operations prove successful. The price of success is cheap and loss in case of failure is limited. The expression “when the operations have been successfully concluded ,, will need to be defined and a time-limit must be fixed. I can provide armoured cars and aeroplanes as soon as road and weather permit. An early acceptance or otherwise of Bicharakoff’s suggestion is desirable in view of BicharakofFs detachment having already begun to arrive at Kasvin and anticipated early Jangali action in that quarter.42 Telegram R., No. 2982, dated the 2nd (received 4th) April 1918.

I should prefer not to take any action against Persians which could give Persian Government colourable pretext for protest until our troops are so far advanced on Kermanshah-Hamadan-Kasvin line as to exercise real influence on political situation in Tehran. Effect on the Persian Government of the plea that we were assisting Governor in execution of his duty would be the reverse of conciliatory. They do not want our help; all they want is that we should get out. All the same I am in sympathy with your project, and will support it at earliest favourable opportunity.

Shushtar. —The Shushtar district comprises first that turbulent and fanatical town itself, the Miyanab-i-Shusbtar or island formed by the Gargar and Shat-ait rivers, a fringe of Guhduzlu country south-east of the town and east of the Gargar including the Anglo-Persian Oil Company depot at Darreh Khazineh, and the Daincheh and Parwandeh estates north-west as far as Kaunak. Owing to the decentralisation of the administration into various depart ments paid from Persian funds, the absence of the Governor (Ain-ul-Mulk), on half pay in no way dislocated the machinery of government, but on the death of his deputy in October Ain-Ul-Mulk's connection with Arabistan ceased and Abdullah Khan Mustaufi, the most suitable local, notable and recently British Consular Agent, was put in temporarily as Deputy Governor. In September the Political Officer, Captain F. S. Greenhouse, I.A., was transferred to Dizfui to hold charge during the absence of Captain C. J. Edmonds in Luristan, and owing to the illness of his successor-designate (Major Bailey), Shushtar remained without a British officer. This circumstance appears to have encouraged hostile elements to believe that we were slackening our hold on Arabistan, and a band of desperadoes who had been expelled to Ram Hormuz entered the town secretly and on the evening of November 2nd murdered the Imam Juma, some time our consular news-writer and recently head of the department of Justice. The murderers then called upon the disorderly elements of the town to overthrow the regime of order. The Political Agency was surrounded and the town in a ferment. Captain Greenhouse with half a squadron of t:ie 5th Cavalry under Major Mackintosh reached Shushtar at 8 a.m. the following morning after a night march of 45 miles, and by noon disturbance was at an end. The General Officer Commanding, Karun Eront, arrived ou the 4th with a movable column from Ahwaz and severe punishment was meted out to the offenders, three ringleaders being shot after trial by a Court, comprised of the Deputy Governor of the town, and the Political Officer, and a number of others being sentenced to terms of imprisonment. The manner in which the affair was handled has strengthened our position and prestige. 5. Vagar-ul-Mulk, the New Governor, arrived on 1st February. His » past record in Arabistan is not a good one, and it is unfortunate that soon after his arrival M ajor E. M, Bailey, C.I.E , should have been recalled*to India, leaving the post of Political Officer once more vacant. The measure of financial control we are in a position to exercise together with the fact that he has applied for the payment to him of the personal allowance of Ts. 200 per mensem made to Ain-ul-Mulk from British sources to encourage him to remain, should ensure that he will fall in with our wishes and policy. In these circumstances the presence of a recent nominee of the Persian Government to preserve the facade should strengthen our hands, and render complaints from the Central Government at Tehran less likely. 6. From the point of view of internal administration the position of Shushtar has also much improved. Steps have been taken under the direction of an Engineer officer kindly lent by General Officer Commanding, Karun Front, to dig out the Miyanab canal, long since silted up at the cost of the land-owners. 7. In view of the security attained, the Oil Company has felt justified in erecting a pump and growing their own grain in an estate in the Shushtar Miyanab, combining a considerable reduction of actual expenditure with a saving of tonnage from India. 8. The reorganisation of the revenue and allied departments continues to give most satisfactory results. New taxation laid down by the Persian Government, such as nawaqil, is now being collected, and given a continu ance of these conditions it should shortly be possible to pay the Government budget out of local revenues and no longer draw on Customs as at present. 9. A new trained chief of the Judicial Department has recently arrived from Bushire to take the place of the murdered Imam, and it is hoped that the presence of an outside unbiassed president will purge the Court of the abuses that crept in during the time of the late incumbent. v*** •J---j n ICT 10. Dizful .—The country administered from Dizful is bounded roughly on the east by the foot hills north of the Dizful-Kaunak road, thence by° the Kaunak stream to a point south of Deh Nau : on the south by an imaginary line running from the said point due west to the noseshaped bend of the Karkheh ; on the west by the Karkheh itself. To the north there is no definite boundary. This area, it will be seen, overlaps that of the Shaikh of Mobam- merah, so as to include both branches of the A1 Kathir Arabs, the Dibais Chaab and the Abdal Khan. The Shaikh, however, keeps no representative among these tribes. The presence of the detachment at Shush, together with the fact that inter-tribal politics bring the tribes largely into contact with those administered directly from Dizful, has made it convenient for the Political Officer, Dizful, to have direct dealings with them. He, however, abstains from interference in their internal disputes as long as they do not threaten to result in a breach of the peace. All questions connected with them are dealt with in consultation with the Shaikh or on lines in harmony with his wishes and policy. The arrangement has worked well in practice. 11. As regards Dizful town, the position continues satisfactory. The remarks regarding the revenue and allied departments at Shushtar apply with perhaps even greater force to Dizful. For the first time for many years the grain contributions have been collected in kind, the barley was bought for the Political Agency stables, and the wheat stored for sale at reasonable rates in the difficult times just before the new harvest. Last year the collections were insufficient to pay even the Ilevenue staff. Early in the present year commencing March 1917, the arrears of salary claimed by them were paid off, part of our own claim for payments to the JBakhtiari sowars during the bankruptcy of the .Revenue Department , has been settled, and an allotment of Ts. 400 per mensem is now being paid for the upkeep of a town police force, the first step on the road to decentralb sation, which must precede the introduction of a Persian Deputy Governor, unless the whole fabric is to collapse on our withdrawal from direct adminis- ) tration. The increased area under cultivation, wdiile it has not relieved all anxiety, has materially contributed to preserve Arabistan from the famine prevalent in the rest of Persia, and has made it possible to feed the starving Bakhtiaris who came down to the plains some weeks earlier than usual owing to the scarcity in the hills. 12. VVo k on the bridge has continued satisfactorily. The temporary suspension bridge is in course of re lacemeut by a more solid structure under the superintendence of Captain Stokes, R.E., and much progress made with the repair of the arches before the arrival of the floods. With the temporary opening of the Luristan trade r ute receipts reached an unexpectedly high figure and though this profitable source of income is temporarily closed, the takings remain satisfactory. 13. The most important question in the Dizful area is the control of the Bakhtiari, Arab and Lur tribes in the district, and on its borders. The tribes actually in our sphere have remained as before under complete control. Arrange ments have been made during the summer to control the Khasraj tribe, who by raiding from across the Karklieh had been responsible for almost the only disorders in the province. This has strengthened our position. An unsatisfactory turn of affairs in Luristan however has seriously impaired the strong position we had achieved, and steps will have to be taken ' possibly backed by military action to restore it. 14 At the beginning of September the Political Officer at Dizful, Captain C. J. Edmonds, was ordered to proceed to Tehran via, Luristan. He met with a most enthusiastic reception at all points on the route, at Khurram- a bad and Burujird, merchants were elated at the progress of their business, the tribesmen at the profits of donkey hire and road tolls. 15. It so happened that a large caravan comprising 600 animals with loads of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and many more belonging to native merchants leit shortly afteV. A rumour was spread that Captain Edmonds had been murdered between Khurramabad and Burujird, whereupon the Dirik-wand fell upon the caravan near Khurramabad and divided it up. On hearing the truth they repented of their action, and wrote to Burujird that they wereguarding the goods pending afrangements for their return. Another body of Dirik-wand however hearing of the occurrence ne&amp;r Khurramabad, fell upon a second caravan of several thousand loads belonging to native merchants, some two days* march out from DizfuL The whole tribe thereupon gave up hope of (V putting themselves right with the British authorities, and so resuming their profits, and encouraged by various outside influences, including the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh resigned themselves to returning once more to their normal state of outlawry and brigandage. Captain Edmonds returned to Khurramabad, but in the face of general hostility of the townsmen and tribesmen who had bought the goods at absurdly low rates, was unable to effect anything. 16. The set back to our prestige was great, and has naturally reacted on our General position. This has to a certain extent been neutralised by the strong action taken at Shushtar, but the tribes implicated have raided friendly sections not implicated in the outbreak who had been allowed nearer town, and committed a series of robberies in the district, and so impaired the record of security that had distinguished the province for the preceding year. 17. The winter, however, has passed without Serious incident, and the tribes will be moving upcountry in the first half of March. 18. In the meantime His Majesty’s Minister has sanctioned the infliction of a line on Khurramabad and Luristan, by a levy on all goods exported thither from HizCul. As prices in Khurramabad rule about double those in Bizful, and imports from the west and north are cut off, a charge heavy enough to be felt, but not sufficient to stifle the trade can probably be imposed, and should have a salutary effect. Further, only tribes not impli- cated in the outbreak will be allowed to carry for hire, and this should go iar to encourage all friendly elements. The Political Officer should be able to carry, out this policy with the means already at his disposal, but it would be helpful if the military authorities were prepared to assist in a course which will possibly go to prevent complications later. 19. With regard to the Bakhtiari nomads whose robberies and pilfer ing were the cause of so much complaint last year, the measures then taken appear not to have been forgotten and complaints to date have been very few. 20 Bukhtiari —-It remains to consider the general Bakhtiari question. It will be recollected that in the spring of 1917, Sardar Muhtasham the lllkhani or Executive governor of the Bakhtiari country, resigned office, the reasons given being his inabili.y to accept the position created by (1 the despatch of British troops to the oil-fields. (2) The position we had built up in Arabistan with the consequent check on the rapacity and oppression 01 the Bakhtiaris in Dizful and Shushtar. (3) Our failure to assist him in the campaign against the Kuhgelu. ^ j tt-. Efforts to make him reconsider his decision were fruitless and His Maiestv’s Vice-Consul recommended as his successor Sardar Zaffar, who under- took to - accept lovally the position at the fields at Dizful and Shushtar to maintain friendship with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and to comply with a number of other conditions destined to preserve British interests from untoward complications. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran at first promised support, hut ^subsequently had doubts as to his ability to obtain the concurrence of the senior* 1 Khans in the capital and intimated he considered the arrangement impracticable. ^ . Complete anarchy, involving closing of the Lynch road, prevailed for some weeks, but gradually Sardar Zaffar with Sirdar Ashja as lllbegi assumed the direction of affairs. In the meantime the Khans m Tehran, seeing a Chance of recovering their former position in the oapital owing to the Russian Debacle and realizing that disorder in Bakhtiari would prejudice this c anee, accented the Zaffar and Ashja combination. This was in the nuddle oi J y. Thesechiefs however had attlined their position williou. oiu o^si^qr at Tehran, and we no longer had the claims ou them, which we if the original policy of supporting him la een m • , j +ne by Septemuer Zaffar had restored unexampled order on the Lynch road, tuehostile intrigues of the ^-Illkhani were sufficiently serious to enable him to extort from Zaffar a written undertaking to enter into no negotiations with us and His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, expressed the opinion that these intrigues were not merely the outcome of dissatisfaction with Zaffar, but were directed against ourselves. r | The question of giving practical support to Sardar Zaffar once more came under review in November, in connection with the possibility of a recru descence of enemy activity in Persia, following the Russian collapse. In the meantime however Sardar Zaffar, in the face of the opposition of his brother Khans, and the absence of support from Tehran, threatened to resign, and declared himself unable to come down to the low country. Either course would have had a most unfortunate effect, and his resignation would probably have been followed by anarchy in the whole tribe. It was, therefore, decided to give Zaffar financial accommodation, and (after receipt of authority from His Majesty’s Government early in January) assistance with arms and ammunition. We have, moreover, in virtue of our position in Arahistan been able to do Zaffar a personal favour by arranging with the Maliyeh department of the revenue due on his estate, while claims on other Khans have been demanded in full, so assisted, Sardar Zaffar felt strong enough to come down and has arrived at Malamir., The Bakhtiari situation at the moment, therefore, is more encouraging than it has been for some time past. The corner-stone of our policy is Support for Zaffar. Though the first opportunity of attaching him definitely to our side was lost, our recent assistance has given us claims on his co operation, on which we may rely with some degree of confidence. A.

Most of the extreme democrats have left and Kermanshah is quieter than it has recently been though outrages are still the rule at night. Prices are again rising in the town, though in consequence of embargo on exports prices maintain at lower level than in districts where in some places severe famine conditions prevail. There are many indications that Sinjabis have definitely re-established their connection with enemy. Their efforts to unite tribes which appear to have been made in accordance with orders from Persian Government have been unsuccessful, and majority of Kermanshah tribes now form an opposition against them. 88 Telegram P., No. 210, dated the 14th (received 15th) March 1918.

Many reports are reaching me to the effect that Russian Officers of Persian Cossack Division are not to be trusted. I believe position to be this Officer Commanding and majority of other officers have hitherto been loyal; they are however liable to be actuated by their own personal interests and many of them are clearly feeling the universal Russian dislike of seeing British troops in North Persia. Officer Commanding indeed professes to rejoice at their arrival, which will make his own position and that of his officers secure both as regards their pay and as against the efforts of Persian Government to bring them into direct dependence on Persian Government. Nevertheless there is always strong probability that they will be influenced by general tone of Russian feeling towards Great Britain sooner of later.2 89 Telegram P., No. 17, dated the 14th (received 15th) March 1918.

It is reported by Consul that he has seen recent orders issued to Governor of Kerman by Persian Government whereby the making of forward purchases or sales of grain is made a criminal offence. This is nominally in order to prevent recurrence of shortage but is really aimed by Democrats against South Persia Rifles who are alleged to have caused present shortage by their forward purchases of grain. This will make the position extremely difficult and is an additional argument for the declaration of Persia as a war area. 98 Telegram P., No. O -72, dated the 11th (received 13th) March 1918.

Reference the proposal that troops should be moved from Shiraz to Ispahan and possibly to near Tehran in order that Legation and friendly Persian Cabinet, if such exists, might be guarded. Our views were asked for by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and after consulting Sykes a reply in the following terms was sent in telegram No. IS539, dated the 8th March, from the Commander-in-Chief in India : 1. That in view of the supply difficulties and of the necessity of basing an advance on Tehran on a secure Ispahan requiring friendly relations with the Bakhtiaris for political reasons and to enable the Lynch road to be opened up, it is considered that the movement should be to Ispahan only. 2. Hamadan could meet the urgent needs of Tehran more effectively. 3. The move from Shiraz to Ispahan should be made by Indian troops with a detachment of the South Persia Rifles, the presence of the former at Shiraz and on the Bandar Abbas communication to supp 3rt the latter being necessary after as w r ell as during the move.5 4. To enable this to be arranged it will be necessary to send the following reinforcements from India :— 3 Squadrons Cavalry. 4 Guns, Mountain Artillery. 1 Battalion Infantry, Troops detailed for other war theatres will have to furnish the, Infantry and the Mountain Guns. Immediate orders for the move, if decided upon, must be given as owing to climatic reasons the move from Bandar Abbas must be made not later than March, 5. The first part of the force could probably reach Ispahan five weeks from the date of the order to move while it would take 18 weeks for the Indian reinforcements and the last part of the force. 6. It is not unlikely that a new Brigade of South Persia Bifles will have to be organised at Ispahan and we must be prepared for this. Ends. The War Cabinet’s orders have not yet been received, but to prevent loss of time in the event of the move being authorised, the mobilisation of the necessary troops has been carried out and arrangements made for adminis trative details, excepting 2 cavalry squadrons as Sykes cannot feed them till after the July harvest. We have informed Sykes and requested him to make all preparations for the march which are possible in anticipation. 100 Telegram P., No. 214*, dated the 15th (received 16th) March 1918.

(Addressed Foreign Office, London ; repeated Baghdad and Hamadan.) I have received no observations from Cabinet in reply to announcement of despatch of troops. I learn, however, on what I believe to be good authority that extremist party are urging a policy of stubborness in expectation of some event which is to take place about 5 weeks hence which will enable them to defy usi Meanwhile they would crush all opposition here by arrest of opponents and suppression of newspapers. The violent section of opposition have been approaching me for my sup port in case of coup to upset Cabinet. I have declined to countenance it, however, as it is not clear that they have a sufficient force to bring off that coup by violent means or have any definite programme or competent leaders. Difficulty moreover is not to upset this particular Cabinet but to get a better one while our troops are distant. Whatever the reliance to be placed on Cossack Division, it would not in my opinion extend to point of being able to ask8 Russian Officer Commanding to support such a coup for even if he consented and coup were successful do I think such statesmen as Yosough Dowleh would take office. Hence our more prudent course is to keep things quiet here, in expectation that Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek’s coup d'etat will not be equal to carrying out programme which would lead him near to revolution against Shah. This refers to my telegram No. 206. 109 Telegram P., No. 221, dated the 16th (received 17th) March 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office, London ; repeated Baghdad.) A report from an officer usually trustworthy has been received by Officer Commanding Cossack Division to the effect that 1,500 Jangalis without guns have reached point 25 miles north of Kasvin in mountains. My own informa tion goes to show that Jangali leader is indisposed to move for the present and I do not credit the report which is susceptible of another explanation. On the other hand such an advance is quite possible in the 10 days since my last news from Resht. I am sure urgent invitations are being sent them by some of Ministers, and these must be expected to accelerate a Jangali movement hither. It is essential therefore to forestall it if possible. According to arrangements being made at Baghdad (General Officer Commanding telegram X.-7172) possible occupation of Kermanshah seems to be contemplated some time before May, This seems to lose sight of political contingencies in interval. Would it not be possible to hurry up even a modest force with 1 or 2 aeroplanes to be placed under Dunsterville to Hamadan. This would certainly prevent any coup d'etat by Jangalis. Opposition from organised forces need not be anticipated. ‘ This is with reference to my telegram* 134 to Baghdad. 110 Telegram P., No. 223, dated the 17th (received 18th) March.1918.

Captain Noel was arrested at Enzeli by Jangalis and Hildebrandt himself was detained by Bolsheviks for 12 hours. There are 400 Red Guards at Enzeli and 40 at Besht, who do not seem to intend moving on Tehran.

I shall be very glad to hear of selection of a Vice-Consul or Political Officer for Bakhtiari. My own opinion is that we should have a whole-time man who should be fairly senior, should have rank of Consul, and should he always with Khans either in Bakbtiari or in Arabistan except when he might find it necessary to visit Ispahan, or more seldom Tehran. In view of present necessity for avoiding appearance of interfering in Bakhtiari affairs, we can hardly introduce such an arrangement now, after the war however we might do so. Enclo.

Report on recent movements of the murderers of the Imam Juma at Shushter. After leaving Aquili Qazum spent a few days at Haft Shehidum and Gutwand and then made for Malamir where, it is stated, he saw Salar Akram (son of Sirdar Muhtasham). The latter received him well, but Qazum apparent ly did not put much faith in him and left for Eughilu where he had an inter view with Husain Khan Bahmai. The latter refused to give him shelter or safe conduct and Qazum in disgust returned to Ram Hormuz, in or near which the rest of the gang were hiding. 2. From then onwards the murderers considered themselves fairly safe and went about more or less openly. They had many friends amongst the Shushteris residing in Ramuz, and a man named Mulla Hassan Harizapaz, who lives at Wais conveyed messages for them between Ramuz and Shushter. On one occasion Al: Qazpiaz actually entered Shushter by the Balaiti gate, and visited Agha Hassan Ali. He also went to the door of his own house and asked after his family, but did not venture inside. Information was received in Ahwaz that the gang were desperate and were only waiting till one of their number, Abdah, had recovered from an illness to make for Shushter and kill Abdullah Mustaufi, and one or two others. As there was little hope of getting effective action taken by Amir Quli Khan, the Deputy Governor of Ramuz, it was arranged that Dr. Young, who was about to visit Sirdar Fateh at Abbid, should arrange personally with the latter for the arrest of the gang. In the meantime the Assistant Political Officer, Shushter, sent a telegram to Amir Quli Khan asking him to arrest the murderers. The deliverer of the telegram was delayed (Amir Quli Khan states by two days, but Ido not believe this) by the operator at Ramuz, Agha Jan, at the instigation of Syed Mohammed Hussain, agent of Lynch Brothers, and Qazum managed to get away to Jaizun where he stayed first with Haji A.ssadullah and afterwards with Mir Gulaigal, an Arab, who has taken refuge from the Shaikh of Mohammerah with the Bakhtiaris. Dr. Young found on his arrival at Shushter en route for Abbid that Amir Quli Khan had betn wired to and had replied that the murderers had left Ramuz and in the circum stances considered it best not to mention the subject to Sirdar Fateh during his visit. 3. At the same time I heard from Ram Hormuz that Amir Quli Khan was about to be succeeded as Deputy Governor by Parvez Khan, brother of Muntazim-ud-Daulah, and son of the late Isfandiar, and it was obvious that Amir Quli could take no steps to arrest the gang even if he wished to. As it was important to have early news of the movements of the gang, I sent out a special agent to Ramuz with instructions to report by telegram in a cypher which we had arranged, the departure of and route taken by any of the gang. He reached Ram Hormuz late on the 25th, and found that Qazum, Abdah, Mokarram, Ali Qazpiaz and a man named Riza had leL the morning before for Shushter, via the hill road (Jaru, Baitwand, etc.). He tried to send off a telegram, but it was refused by the operator mentioned above, and not being able to get a Qasid owing to the w r et weather, he had to bring the news himself. He arrived on the evening of the 29th, and his news was communicated to Major Bailey by telephone the same night. The gang thus had six days’ start, but it is quite possible that they have been delayed by the bad weather and have not yet got into Shushter. Qazum has expressed his intention of killing (1) Abdullah Mustaufi, (2) Hussain Shishagiri, Chief of Police, and (3) Major Bailey himself if opportunity offers.14 4. All my information goes to show that Syed Hussain, Lynch’s Agent at Ramuz, had helped the gang consistently since they were expelled from Shush- ter. He has housed them, and furnished them with clothing and money ? He gave them tomans 120 before they left for Shushter this last time, and all their moveable property is said to be in his house at the present moment. It is said that Nusrat-ul-Mulk (Shaikh Chassib) has secretly asked him to give every assistance to Qazum and Company and Qazum sent a letter through Syecl Mohamed Hussain to Sirdar Arfa asking for protection, but received no reply. I have received other unfavourable reports regarding Syed Mohamed Hussain who is believed to be actively engaged in smuggling arms from Arabistan to the North of Persia, and something will have to be done to restrict his opportunities for mischief. 5. I am asking the Officer Commanding Telegraphs to arrange, if possible, for the removal of Agha Jan to some other district. E. G. B. PEEL, Assistant Political Officer, Ahwaz.

I have it on good authority that if the Shaikh of Mohammerah guarantees the lives of the murderers of the Imam Juma, they would give themselves up to him for detention. They have I understand written to Shaikh and also to his son Chasib, but former has not replied. It is most undesirable that these men who are now desperate should be any longer at large, as they rely on Bakhtiaris by whom they might be employed any day to no good purpose. I am advised that they would not consider any overtures from Governor, Shushter, w r hom they do not trust.

It is impossible to reconcile the above with your telegrams which though preparing us for great reductions hold out the hope of reliable reinforcements from the Caucasus and a useful remnant from Baratoff’s Force. 4. We are now considering the question as to the possibility and eventual necessity of sending British troops to take the place of Russians, and as this affects the whole question of policy in Persia, it is most important that yoiir considered appreciation on the following points should be sent to us without delay:— {a) Maximum number of really reliable troops now with Baratoff who are likely to respond to the call for volunteers and whether tbfc presence of the British Cavalry Regiment at Hamadan would m any way tend to increase this number. (S) Task which the above could perform, e.g., maintenance of hold on Enzeh and security of whole or part of Enzeli-Kermanshah com- mumcations. (c) In the event of it being found undesirable to send any British troops except armoured cars, to replace Russians and if latter evacuated Persia entirely except for Enzoli, would Persian Cossacks, if stiffened and increased by British officers be sufficient to guarantee the safe passage of British detachments from Mesopotamia for the Caucasus.

(Addressed Secretary of State, and Cox.) Government of India’s suggestions seem unexceptionable as a general programme of our intentions to keep before us which we might announce as suitable opportunities occur. I would, however, most strongly deprecate their being made basis of negotiation for definite undertakings on our side. So obvious is the intention to procrastinate that it would afford extremist party- legitimate grounds for accusing us of insincerity and would unquestionably shake moderates who are inclined to believe in our friendship. Owing to a large number of circumstances (e g., increasing Jangali audacity, our own immobility in Mesopotamia, conclusion of peace between Germany and Ukraine) Cabinet is more and more inclined to procrastinate, and the ex tremists in Tehran are becoming emboldened to recommence policy of intimidation, to which the Ministers are particularly sensitive. Negotiations on lines of your telegram No. 900 would in these conditions be sheer waste of time. Policy of conciliation has proved a success in that it has divided the democrat party ; and a very considerable section, possibly the majority, now leans towards us, and I do net believe that to pursue it further by means of additional concessions would bring us more converts. Extremists will always be irreconcilable but though clamourous, and ready to use violence, they are not numerous and will collapse before exhibition of force. Our only safe policy now is to take whatever measures we think necessary in our interests without reference to Persian Government and also to announce spontaneously to them and to the nation what concessions we are prepared to make. It is essential that the measures should be thorough. This is with reference to Government of India’s telegram No. 146. 191 Telegram P., dated the 14th (through B-obat) (received 15th) February 1918.

Without the Commandant’s knowledge however and even before vacation by the Cossacks Persian Cossack Brigade with the Russian Consul-General’s approval took over the caravanserai occupied by them, which had been selected by us for our cavalry on account of military considerations, sanitary reasons, and its proxi mity to the water supply and to Consulate. Russian Consul-General who has shown complete disregard for British interests had said nothing to me about the matter. Caravanserai hitherto occupied by the Persian Cossacks is unsuitable for our requirements and is too remote. If regiment had not gone Persians would not have left it. Persian Cossacks say they are acting on orders from Tehran. I hope that you will be able to arrange for them to hand over the premises to us. We should otherwise find satisfactory arrangement most difficult.Telegram P., No. 1621, dated the 16th (received 17th) February 1918.

(Addressed to Foreign Office; repeated Baghdad and South Persia Rifles very confidentially. Yesterday morning Colonel Filaretov, Commanding Hamadan Battalion Persian ^ Cossacks (which has been retained in Tehran until after departure of Russian troops from Hamadan), after serving out ammunition to his men and placing them at principal points of Cossack barracks here called on Officer Commanding Division, against whom he had a personal grudge, to resign. A large proportion of officers supported him. Officer Commanding resigned after some two hours discussion in which Russian Minister and other Russian officers took part and Colonel Starsowselski, Commander, Tehran regiment, has, with acquiescence of Persian Minister of War, taken over com-mand temporarily. Colonel Starsowselski has asked Colonel Filaretov to resign and latter agrees to do so. Though there was no disturbance incident is most unfortunate as being destructive of military value of division and undermining authority of Officer Commanding in eyes of Persian rank and file. I consider we should continue to pay division for the present as Colonel Starsowselski appears well disposed. Regrettable results may also ensue politically. Even in Government circles there has been good deal of talk of calling on Russian officers to obey orders of Maximalist Government to return to Russia and of placing division under Swedish Officer Commanding Gendermerie. I have warned Persian Government against such folly, but Persian Government will be apt to argue that division may as well be under Persian officers after this exhibition of Russian discipline. 198 Telegram P v No. 112-F., dated the 17th (received 18th) February 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty ; s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Oifice; repeated Baghdad. First paragraph repeated to Shiraz.) Please refer to my immediately preceding telegram. Colonel Orton and Consul, Shiraz, are both strongly opposed to withdrawal of troops from South and I think that in view of recent developments any measure that could be looked on as a sign of weakness on our part, as this would be, is at present out of the question. Reports from Shiraz and Bandar Abbas show that on instigation from Tehran Soulet-ed-Dowleh is trying to make trouble in Kawam’s country and that he has sent to Lar a considerable number of sowars for this purpose. I suggest that we could, if necessary, give this as a reason to Persian Government for declining to agree to withdrawal, but it would be preferable to leave them without a reply pending a decision by His Majesty’s Govern ment on the question of despatch of troops to hold Kermanshah-Kasvin road which is rendered more than ever necessary on account of the Cossacks Divi sion incident of yesterday. 199 Telegram P., No. 115-F., dated the 17th (received 18th) February 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed London Foreign Office j repeated Cox.) Secret. Letter dated February 16th has been intercepted from Obeffiulla still in Turkish Embassy here to Kuchik Khan acknowledging one received and inviting latter to move to Hamadan where assistance of Turkish troops is promised. Services of three Turkish officers now in Tehran are also offered. Letter shows that the Turkish Officer Lutfi Bey is with Kuchik Khan. It has been allowed to go on in the hope of copy of reply being secured. Military authorities should be informed From report from Consul at Hamadan it appears that Kuchik Khan is already in communication with that place. It is evident that enemy well appreciate importance to us of holding Hamadan. This is with reference to my telegram No. 98.6 * 201 {Received with Army Department Memorandum No. 1980, dated the 14th February 1918.) Letter No. 52-260-S. C., dated the 22nd January (received 12th February) 1918. From—The Officer Commanding, Sistan Field Force, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Delhi. &gt; In forwarding a proposed disposal of troops on the Cordon North of Birjand I have the honour to offer the following remarks:— (1) The local political factor is more favourable from a purely military point of view than was the case when this force first entered Persia. Then our presence was resented as an intrusion ; we were friendly with the Russians, and the first fact which forced itself on the intelligence of the native was the rise in prices attributed by them solely to our presence. During the last 2 years, however, the people have discovered that we do not oppress; have brought money into the pockets of many and (which is perhaps of more importance than either of these factors) have caused a cessa tion of those raids which formerly spread a real terror throughout most of the Birjand district. Moreover North of Birjand the inhabitants have suffered considerably from the high-handedness of the Russians, while simultaneously reports of our consi deration for the people have spread. Hence the idea of our extension of our line Northwards which seems now taken for granted by Persians is welcomed as a relief rather than as a burden. (2) As a consequence it is now more easy than before to obtain such sup plies as are in the country. The last crop was bad but a recent fall of snow has given some security for a good harvest to come, and grainholders in Turbat have begun to unload ; indeed prices for grains quite recently have fallen to 40 and 30 per cent, in that place. On the whole then I am forming the impression that it will be possible to feed locally in the near future a considerably larger force if necessary than was suggested in a scheme I saw in Delhi? just at present we are hampered by the fact that the Russians occupy and deny to us Turbat-i-Haidari, the natural source of supply of the line thence South to Kainand therefore this line has to be supplied by us from Sistan by camels which deposit at Birjand a useful load of 2 maunds each only. (3) I am convinced also that there is a good deal of transport available locally in the districts North of Birjand. Moreover it lives permanently in its own boats. Within those limits it has its own sources of fodder supply as between private owner and private indivi dual, and of old standing. They therefore feed on sources to a large extent outside of and never included in grains to be found normally in the markets or for public sale. On the other hand animals brought in from outside must necessarily be fed from available market supplies. This is why I am averse from asking for camel or mule corps transport. The full value of local transport is not yet available nor will be till the Russians move out^and we replace them because to bring local transport out of its own locality is very largely to lose the above mentioned advantages. It should be possible in the near future to supply nearly all grain and fodder locally North of Birjand and to equip every mounted unit with all mule transport for at least 7 days track for the Cordon regular force North of Birjand inclusive. (4) I think the line Kain via telegraph line through Rui Khaf to Turbat better than the alternative via Kidri Amrani because of the telegraphic com munication afforded , and because tactically a salient or zig zag line is better for a cordon than a straight line since for so much longer are parties trying to pass through within reach of troops converging from Posts. I have somewhat altered my opinion of the strength necessary on this Section via Rui Khaf because the tribes in the vicinity seem prrfne to robbery in force, and Rui Khaf should be held in greater strength than was at first intended and when our own convoys begin to move.7 The question arises in this connection how far we should take part in preventing or ^ rescuing villages or caravans being looted by robbers and I propose that without interfering more than necessary, to order such action as is required to render the road safe for all and also those adjacent villages * whence we draw supplies. ° The above may render more clear the reasons underlying the proposed movements of troops (detail attached herewith) now on their way to here and which is convenient compromise between uncertainty of the length of the Russian stay at Turbat and above, and the consequent immediate difficulties of foddering horses North of Sistan. (5) I propose clearing, marking and making possible for motors the road North of Birjand as far as we go. Tffis has already begun with the few infantry now here and arrangements are being made to induce inhabitants of local villages to come out up to 50 a day at 2 Krans a head paid into each man’s hand near sunset each day. I hope also to engage Persian labour to help Sappers and Miners on the roads South of Birjand. Posts. Now. 1st phase. 2nd phase. 3rd phase. Meshed .

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office ; repeated Cox.) Appreciation of situation contained in Government of India’s telegram No. 158-S., appears to me to be largely based on erroneous premises. While it is true that Germany is posing as liberator and would no doubt like to replace British influence here permanently by her own ; her immediate object for sake of effect in East generally is to draw Persia into war against us and she is endeavouring to do so by means of Agents provocateurs, etc., without employing troops which ft would seem she cannot spare. As Govern ment of India say, there is danger from such Agents, but it cannot be met by Persian Cossacks and South Persia Rifles. It may be assumed that if German activities are successful-enough in North Persia as to be dangerous they will also succeed in producing unrest in South which would preclude possibility of withdrawing South Persia Rifles thence to North or North-West. Even if this were possible the extension Northwards of South Persia Rifles’ sphere of action would provoke as great outcry as despatch of troops. We cannot count on Persian Cossacks for no Persian Cabinet would order them to act against Germans if German influence had become really formidable and I should be very averse to trust to a Russian Commandant to act without such an order. In regard to the replacement of Russian by British officers, to effect such a change would require pressure of British troops within easy ’reach of Capital. ‘ ! w ' Only a smajl force is required. It is no question of overawing the handful of reckless factions whose political capital is a spurious patriotism under German inspiration. Despatch of forces instead of discrediting us in Persian eyes would rather conciliate as Persians respect force, while our friends and whole peaceful community would welcome it and instead of making existence of any real Government impossible it would facilitate it for at present every Cabinet goes in fear of extremists and their revulsions. I can form no opinion of effect in Afghanistan but I would point out that if we are to be consistent same consideration would require that extension of British cordon should be abandoned. Military objections as well as difficulties regarding transport and supply are no doubt great but w r hat Russians can do we can do, especially as unreli able force such as they had in Persia would not be employed by us. We cannot place any confidence in Suliman Mirza. He is hopelessly false and venal. I have paid him myself. I contend that, though we have given ample proof of conciliatory spirit, so far we have had no return whatever except further demands, the latest being for the withdrawal of our troops which recent events show to be inadmissible. I am positive that if we did agree to it recognition of the South Persia Rifles by Persian Government would be refused until after withdrawal was actually begun if not indeed completed.9 Present Cabinet while quite likely to resign is showing no inclination whatever to meet our overtures. If Cabinet does resign it will endeavour to throw responsibility on us for not having helped them by agreeing to all their demands. Necessity of keeping open communications with Caucasus is also over looked in Government of India’s appreciation. 204 Telegram P., No. 1710, dated the 19th (received 20th) February 1918* From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghc^td, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi.

Thereupon Jangalis infoikned Vice-Consul through Karguzar that British officers would be — allowed 15 days to pass through, Vice-Consul hears that as soon as Russian troops have passed Jangalis will post force at Menzil to blow up bridge. Vice-Consul has been informed by Jangalis through Karguzar in writing that they will consider themselves justified in taking any measures to frus trate passage of British officers which is contrary to independence of Persia.

Substance of their note to me of February 1 st (report by telegram 80 of February 3rd) has been published by the Persian Government endorsing as a condition of their recognising South Persia Eifles for the duration of the war/ even their request for withdrawal of our troops. They have by this manmuvre practically made that condition sme qua non, for the point will be insisted on so strongly by extremist press that Cabinet will never find courage to withdraw it. Our conversations, therefore, seem doomed to failure. The influence of extremists is responsible for this as they have established a new committee of punishmentwhich is about to announce in the press that it proposes to recommend campaign of assassination. In consequence of their threats Editor of the newspaper I subsidize is preparing to ]eave. Incident at Tabriz reported in my immediately preceding telegram is also significant that Persian Government is prepared forcibly to prevent passage of Caucasian troops through Persian territory, «.&lt;?., to oppose our interests by force. This attitude as^well as the threat of Jangalis is obviously inspired from Tehran. In my opinion it is imperative to show force ourselves at once rather than to adopt the alternative of concession after concession each of which would encourage extremists to greater audacity and with no advantage to ourselves in return. It is, on the contrary, far more likely that they would make some wholly inadmissible demand eventually the consequence of which would be a rupture of relations. 215 Telegram P., No. 131-F., dated the 21st (received 22nd) February 1918.

(Addressed Foreign Office ; repeated Cox.) I ara unable to suggest an alternative Persian Governtnent has no force which, could be trusted to prevent such inroads nor would they use it if they had. As His Majesty’s Government have decided against military occupation of Kermanshah and Kasvin road in favour of a policy of conciliation a reply must now he given to the Persian note of the 1st February (vide my telegram No. 80) and also to the verbal demand of Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the withdrawal of our troops, the delay in replying to which is already leading Cabinet to expect a refusal. Is it desired that a communication should be made to the Persian Govern ment following effect :— * That we agree to withdraw our troops and to enter into pour-parleys respecting the contemplated uniformity of force in return for a recognition of the South Persia Hifles under British officers until the end of war. That we are ready to meet Persians’wishes as regards points 2, 3, and 4, in the note with the qualifications you have already indicated. That we will give final support on lines you have approved. Extremist party by which in reality the Cabinet is terrorised into subser viency has been much encouraged by (scandalous.?) JDunsterville fiasco and I must warn His Majesty’s Government that if these tremendous concessions and particularly that of withdrawal of our troops are made that party will be confirmed in its intransigeance that there will be no end to its demands. It will not be satisfied with the removal of trifles in Pars and Kerman but will require also removal of force at Bushire, of eastern cordon and even of guards at oilfields. The recognition of the South Persia Bifles moreover will be deferred so long as any of our troops remain. Our moderate friends will be correspondingly disheartened by what will be recognised as a sign of weak ness. I do not (think ?) such a step can recommend itself to His Majesty’s Government, I venture to suggest the alternative. The real trouble is — (1) Terrorism which extremists are ready to employ. (2) Jangali menace, which works in with (1) and which prevents former moderate Cabinet which sober Persians would welcome (from returning ?) The discontent with the present Cabinet is such that the Ministers only want excuse to resign but they wish the excuse to be furnished by us. It is thus easy to upset Cabinet; the difficulty would lie in inducing anyone to take office and incur immediate displeasure of terrorists and the future enmity of Jangalis, (By ?) Lavish promises of money for secret service purposes and an engagement that in case of Jangali move on Tehran we will send troops to smash it, we could possibly induce some one to take the risk. We shall have to pay very big sum. It appears to me that if His Majesty’s Government are willing to give undertaking to send troops to protect Cabinet if necessary against Jangalis it would be better to try this course rather than concede the with drawal of our troops with further unlimited concessions which policy of con ciliation would entail in present conditions, concessions moreover which will not bring us anything whatever in return. Both His Majesty’s Government and Government of India consider Afghanistan to be the vulnerable point. Persia, however, is also a danger spot, for if Persia joins our enemies, her example will affect Afghanistan as effective ly as arrival of enemy agents. It is possible to make Persia safe whereas we cannot by any means close Turkestan route to Afghanistan. This is with reference to your telegram No. 104.8 235 No. 7, dated Tehran, the 14th December 1917 (received 11th February 1918). From—His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. With reference to my telegram No. 89 of to-day and to previous tele graphic correspondence, I have the honour to transmit in original a letter from Abdul Karim describing in detail his antecedents and connections with India. . . i Enclo. of Serial No. 235. Respected Sir, The British Legation, Tehran. I was under the impression that you would not investigate so keenly about my Indian origin. Your yesterday’s kind remark on my character troubled my mind the whole l^st night. Every one easily understand that my birth is from my India, and my appearance and mode of my pronunciation shows too. I wms in the Turkish Empire. . I was suspected as a British spy, but now as I am in Persia, I find the reverse of that. God should help me. The ways of the men are quite different. I understand all these the effects of this War of nations. I did not like to give you the information of the composition of my Indian family, but your remark has obliged me to inform you all what 1 know, and what I recollect at present. Otherwise you will have a strange suspicion about my character in future. This will be an obstacle in my future prospect. My father’s family is known in the Punjab as a Sondhi family which has its members in Hoshiarpur, Jullundur, Lahore, Rawalpindi and in other places too. My father’s family name was Pheru Ram, and his father’s name was Rikhiram Sondhi resided in Hariana, District Hoshiarpur. My grandfather had two sons, my father and the other name Aminchand Sondhi. I think who resides in Hariana, Hoshiarpur. My father was a head clerk for some years (with his family name) in the Railway Workshop, Rawalpindi, under R. A. Gildea. My father got the name Haiderali Khan when he married my mother—a secret from my grandfather’s family. My family name is Kidar Nath Sondhi and my mother's name is Karim. I was educated in the Gordon Mission School and College with my family name on the college register. I stood, first in Science and got diploma and a medal from that school. I pro ceeded on my journey with a recommendation letter from the Deputy Com missioner, li oshiarpur, who knew my family for the American Consul-General in 1910 or 1911 I was known in Rawalpindi streets as Karim and was known at Hariana as Kidar Nath Sondhi as my family name. Now you can inquire about me* from the Deputy Commissioner, Hoshiar pur, with my family name, and also from Aminchand about me. That his brother’s son Kidar Nath Sondhi is alive in Persia. I was not willing to inform him by telegrams about my whereabouts for I wanted to surprise him at some time in future. My respected Sir, I am pure-hearted and a frank Indian, I have no con nection with any of your enemies. If I had 1 would have told you. My information about the Turkish troops was true, so far as I know. There was a dissension amongst the German officers and Turks. I have given you information about my family, as far as I can recollect. I remain, Sir, Yours faithfully, KARIM. wma 236 Telegram P., No. 196-S V dated the 25th February 1918. p rom The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, To His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorasan, Meshed.

It was reported to the Legation by the Consul that Kuchik Khan’s real intention is, on the departure of the Russians, to occupy Kermanshah and Hamadan, and not, as announced, by him to move on Tehran. Following is the local political situation : A small but noisy party of the democrats is Pro-Turk. By their extreme ideas they have alienated the moderate democrats landowners and clergy. The moderate democrats, etc , are in favour of friendship with Great Britain and this feeling is growing. The bulk of the population only wants order and is indifferent to politics. The mass of the population would welcome the arrival of British troops. The Governor is said to be in correspondence with Kuchik Khan and inclined to the extreme democrat party, but he has tendered his resignation as he has been frightened by the opposition of the moderates. A number of revolutionary cut throats are with him. The Russians whose force here is only about 200 strong are disliked by all. Orders have been received by Baratoff to withdraw to Kasvm and he is anxiously awaiting news whether any British troops, to whom he can hand over stores and the protection of Banks and Consulates, will come to Hamadan and Kermanshah.

Moreover so far (as) § known here the intentions or policy of His Majesty s Government in regard to the Kurds as a whole have not been defined. As regards Kiamil no information here but enquiries are proceeding. With legard to the Kurd bureau, MAjor Soane working from Zaqin has successfully influenced the Kifri Kurds to refuse supplies to the Turks and to raid convoys. Similar influence is being extended by him to Hamawand Kurds.

Baratoff knows about the arrival at Baku of Dunsterville and first party so apparently there was no difficulty in sea transport. Goldsmith preceded Dunsterville to Baku and I suppose latter acted on his report. The land via Lingan would probably not be practicable because the road requires improvement for motor cars and is unguarded, also in view of the fact that Persian Government have forbidden passage of troops and even officers through Julna. 242 * ^Received with Army Department Memorandum No. 2528, dated the 26th Feb ruary 1918.)

The situation at Enzeli compels my withdrawal to Hamadan where I will await further orders. Road from Hamadan to Enzeli, which is 287 miles long, is crowded with disorderly Bolshevic soldiers. The road from Kasvin to Enzeli (1J2 miles) runs through Jangali territory mostly narrow defiles and later on thick jungle on both sides. The Bolshevics and Red Guards, about 3,000 with guns and gunboat, hold the Port of Qazian. They are very friendly with Jangalis and actively support them with arms and information. Various Austrian and German Agents are working with former. Telegraphs, wireless, patrol, and all ships at Enzeli are controlled by Bolshevics. From the time of our arrival we w r ere virtually prisoners in their hands and they picketed my house and every steamer. I was present at three meetings of the Revolutionary Committee but failed to persuade them to alter their point of view which is, that the Caucasus are their enemy and any attempt by non- Russians to assist them will be resisted with armed force. They further stated that until I returned, their attitude towards my party would remain hostile. They knew or guessed the object of my mission having had news of it from the Caucasus, not from this side. British Consul, Resht, informed me that Kuchik Khan had arranged to attack my party on the way to Enzeli if Russians would remain neutral; the attack was not carried out as Russians refused ; but he informed me officially, through the British Consul, that he wall attack all English parties. His armed men are posted along the road and are ready to act, but w r e passed through them unmolested. I consider that, until situation improves, this road must be regarded as entirely closed. I withdrew from Enzeli and through Jangali territory with difficulty but without bloodshed, but do not think it could be done twice. The situation was so critical at one time, owing to the likelihood of our being made prisoners and searched, that we were obliged to destroy all papers by burning them. I was informed by the Revolutionary Committee that General BaratoS is to be arrested and tried They are actively opposed to the raising of a Volunteer Force in Persia and they intend to break tlie present organization, their policy being the com plete evacuation of Persia by all white races.

(Repeated Baghdad, Tehran, Hamadan and Delhi.) At the front situation is still rather obscure. At Ezerum disorders and small massacres have started between Mahomedans and Armenians. Similar collisions have occurred at Karlu Norshen, Ulukhanlu and in Elizuetopel government. It is worth noting that following all occurred about the same time and practically coincided; Turkish advance on Eebruary 13th breaking off Tartar Armenian negotiations here, outbreak of disorders south of Erivan, closing of Persian frontier at Maku, threatening attitude of Sardar Maku and change of Tartar attitude towards us here. Armenian negotiations with uerreu Kurds on Erzinjan front also stopped. It is anticipated by Armenian heads here that there will be massacres on a large scale about month hence. Have discussed with them measures to defend themselves; this plan is their last resort. I suggest that best measures we can take now are to organise and hold the frontier Urumiyah-Kermanshah, removing Russian troops entirely. The rumour alone of British troops moving to Hamadan and Kermanshah will have great quietening effect here. Eor the guarding of roads and exits in Persia small posts would suffice; formation of Kurdish gendarmerie and irregular battalions could be done. * part of officers # One group undecipherable. coming with Dunsterforce, The im mediate effect of these measures as compared with problematical work here wdth this heterogeneous body in Caucasus would be much more advantageous to political and military situation.

(Addressed Foreign Office, London ; repeated Baghdad.) ^Situation is developing dangerously fast. It is clear that Extremist are seeking to break off relations with us and they are encouraged by number of cir cumstances to think that moment is propitious to liberate country from Eoreign, i.e , British yoke. Bolshevik repudiation of foreign debts and confiscation of foreign property is a fine example to Extremists wdio believe that Germany being certain of victory will assist them in some way, at least with agents and money, and possibly even with a few troops. According to Persian standards Extremists resources are not inconsiderable. There are Jangalis with whom they are in close relations and who have succeeded in working up cm ^-British (campaign ?). So convinced are Persians that old rivalry between Russia and Great Britain is not dead that democrats have offered Colonel Skura a large sum to organize national forces against us. Colonel Skura has refused and intends to return to Russia, but he and a number of other Russian officers are debating whether on arrival to join Germany in fight against Bolsheviks “ as English do nothing to help us.” In these circumstances Persian Nationalists may well think that they can count upon Bolshevik alliance against us and are encouraged to set us at defiance. Great activity is being showm. Near Kasvin a Nationalist \Gendarmerie is forming. Arrangements are being made to organize quick communication with Turks in Sulimanieh and Mosul. Enemy missions seem-* ingly in command of money, are spending liberally in Tehran a great anti- British demonstration is being organised to intimidate Shah against appointing a “ moderate ” to succeed Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek. Throe of the released German Shiraz prisoners have recently landed at Enzeli and are expected in Tehran * ' I shortly. British Vice-Consul at Besht is threatened with arrest in revenge for capture of Sulliman Mirza near Khanikin, and has burnt his Ciphers and confidential Archives and is sending his family to Tehran, so serious does he consider situation to be. Another unfortunate factor is situation in Caucasus and North-Eastern Asia Minor. Our efforts there to form national forces were forces of Armenians and Georgians to the neglect of the Tartars whom we have thus thrown into the arms of the Turks. Thus our actions there and in Urumia districts are regarded as 6m/£-Mosiem and little love (though they have) for the Turks the Persians are disposed to espouse cause of their co-religionists. Idea of a religious war is same and is confirmed by massacres which have apparently already commenced and with capture of Erzeroum, etc , Moslem cause seems to be triumphant. We are rapidly approaching situation of November 1915 which was saved by Baratoff’s column. Here I am practically powerless. Even newspapers I am subsidising dare scarcely urge moderation as editors remember Matin-es-Sultaneh’s fate while a moderate Statesman who is possible candidate for premiership has sent me word not to spoil his chances by communicating with him. In the meantime • we are daily aggravating situation by various actions which indicate every intention to take strong measures in our own interests such as repairing of Kermanshah-Eerind road and telegraph line, arrest of Sulliman Mirza, institution of Eastern Cordon, Bandar Abbas-Niriz-Kerman telegraph line^— all actions which lead our friends to expect (forcible ?) measures from us, especially as magnitude of our forces in Mesopotamia and (promise ?) of enemy | is well known. But unless I am able to promise material support a moderate Cabinet pledged to pursue friendly policy towards (us ?) is most unlikely to be formed in face of Extremists If we do not show force, Extremists will be^encouraged to throw themselves more and more into, arms of enemy. Con ciliation by means of further concessions is useless as it is trying to reconcile (irreconcilables ?). ( ? ) remedy is occupation of Kermanshah, Hamadan and if necessary of Kasvin as soon as Bussians have evacuated. I believe force 10,000 men would suffice amply. Unless this can be done we must face probability of an early rupture of relations. This is with reference to my telegram No. 139. / o S.G P.I., Delhi -652 1 ', &amp; P.

If I now make a definite statement including that concession, we run risk of encountering an equally definite reply which I have no hope would be favourable. Before this step which will put us in a very awkward position is taken it is right for me to know whether the apparent threat conveyed by allusion to our Mesopotamian force is meant as such and whether His Majesty’s Government have decided what action they will take should threat be disregarded.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, Tc—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- More than one enquiry has been made by Farman Farma as to what his fate is to be in case of collapse of situation here. As that eventuality now seems (not ?) improbable I should be glad to know what answer is to be given. He cites the case of Nizam-us-Sultaneh who received a very large sum said to be £80,000 and a guarantee of indemnity in the event of his estates being confiscated. Farman Farma expects something similar. His Majesty’s Government have of course foreseen far reaching effect in South Persia of a collapse here and their course of action has no doubt been decided. If the intention is to reinforce Sykes and in fact hold South and East Persia; Farman Farma may possibly decide if properly guaranteed to remain and throw in his lot with us; if not he would elect to go to India. There are of course others in a similar position : in particular his son Firuz who has been our most prominent adherent in Tehran, and Shaukat-ul- Mulk, Governor of Sistan, and Kawam-ul-Mulk. These questions have hitherto not seemed to have any urgency; if, however, information received from Kasvin {vide No. 156 of to-day) has any foundation in fact, it would be well to take them into consideration at once. According to my earlier information no Jangali movement in this direc tion was contemplated for two months or more ; but it is possible that German agents, realising possibility of move on our part from Baghdad have induced Kuchik Khan to forestall us by a coup with Bolshevik assistance before departure of last Bussian troops.

Available information here re war prisoners in Turkestan is as follows :— Russians variously estimate total at 30,000 and 50,000. Proportion of officers is exceedingly small and great majority are Austrians, Turkish prisoner re captured here, estimated that there were 12,000 prisoners at Taskhend last November, of these 5,000 were Germans and 7,000 Austrians. There were only about 30 Turks and Russian military agent confirms the fact that very few Turks were interned in Turkestan. Majority of prisoners in Transcaspia were transferred to Turkestan during 1916 and probably only a few hundreds remain in Transcaspia, but estimation is difficult as since revolution and particularly lately they have enjoyed complete freedom. Men scattered over country earniug their livelihood as they can. Prisoners’ camps as such no longer exist. Commandant Askabad recently confessed his entire ignorance of number in that towm. We have heard of few escapes to Persia latterly but we have just been informed of 15 Austrians at Bujnurd who state that more are on the way; and the recent use of this route, presumably for Tehran, is confirmed from another source. Doubtless immediate cause is withdrawal of Russian troops Asterbad and region. 12 {Received with Army Department endorsement No. 2565, dated the 27th February 1918.)

At Enzeli the revolutionary committee themselves intimated that they regarded all members of the volunteer force as enemies to the Bolshevik party and I know it will mean sending them to their death to send them through Enzeli. Something must be done for them. The suggestion is to send them to Baghdad, and if their services cannot be used there, they might be sent to Foreign Legion in France.

(1st sentence undecipherable. Repetition called for.) At present the only route to Caucasus open to me is by Tabriz. This is possible only, if I am supported by an adequate force of troops both as escort and to keep open the road. The route is impassable for motor cars. It lies along the border of Jangali country which is already hostile to us and the passage of troops or even officers through Julfa has been fobidden by the Persian Government. All available pack transport, moreover is being now used for Russian evacua tion rendering supply difficult. Transport will still be scarce after completion of evacuation many animals now lying daily from lack of food, overwork and neglect. In view of activity of German Agents and growing strength of Kuchi Khan which has much increased owing to latter having proclaimed that he himself turned back my party from Enzeli, it would be necessary to hold road from Mesopotamia to Kasvin inclusive.24-A.

The situation of the Russian Volunteer Force in Persia does not appear to understood thoroughly. At Hamadan there are about 200 at Kasvin about 100 and at Enzeli 100. The latter are virtually prisoners of the -Bolsheviks. Tiflis has ordered this foroe to hold line Kasvin to Enzeli. They cannot do this as Bolsheviks oppose their organisation and are stronger than they are and are in alliance with Jangalis who desire evacuation from Persia of all Europeans. Thus, unless supported by British troops Volunteer Force cannot remain in Persia and cannot return to Russia as Enzeli is in hands of Bolsheviks whose bitter hostility they have incurred by loyalty to cause of allies. 24-B.

As the present situation in Persia is m the melting pot owing to Russian evacuation and weak Government it seems necessary to occupy’ line Kasr-i- shiin to^ Enzeli with a view to operations in Caucasus and to safeguarding British interests in Persia I am convinced that Persian inhabitants would welcome this ; he only wants security and cares not who gives it to him Doubtless, the Persian politician, who does not represent the people, would make capital out of it and agitate. I think small number of troops would be sufficient and suggest one Regiment of Cavalry, one Battery of Mountain Artillery, one Infantry Brigade, one Battery L.A.M. Cars and aeroplanes stationed at Hamadan, Kermanshah and Kasvin. Bridges at Menjil at Kermanshah very important require immediate guard especially the latter. Kuchi Khan has notified that, as soon as last Russians are through he will destroy latter but I doubt his carrying out his threat. If no signs of putting in British Troops are given evacuation of Consuls and Bank officials with closing of banks may be necessary shortly. Consider action should be taken immediately. Jangali movement spreads only because there is no sign, which the people expect, of a counter movement. The Kuchis troops are not of any military value and the Kuchi Khan bubble only requires pricking From Menjil to Resht the country is very difficult for operations of Regular Troops but it is possible to control the whole situation from Kasvin and any trouble in Gilan country would probably be quelled by aeroplane operations. 24-C.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; repeated to Baghdad.) Following is draft of statement and declaration of concessions I bad in view. In view of Persian Government’s failure to take any measures or to give adequate guarantees against enemy activities in Persia (of renewal of which during past months, there exists incontestable proof) His Majesty’s Govern ment have been compelled to send detachments of troops to certain places in North-Western Persia so as to insure against recurrence of the situation !'I brought about by enemy agency in the autumn and early winter of 1915. It is with the greatest reluctance that this step has been decided on. It will be carried on with every possible care to avoid interference with infernal adminis tration (from me ?) and is in no sense Directed against Persia’s independence and integrity which is Great Britain’s constant policy to respect and maintain. These detachments will be withdrawn as soon as circumstances permit and in any case at the end of the w r ar. As proof that Great Britain’s friendly disposition towards Persia has undergone no change, His Britannic Majesty’s Legation has been authorised to make the following declaration as regards certain matters that have been the subject of recent discussion between the two Governments. 1. His Majesty’s Government are ready to enter into immediate pour parleys with the object of creating at end of war a single uniform force under neutral officers for maintenance of order throughout Persia, such officers to be subjects of a power to be agreed on by two Governments. 2. His Majesty’s Government regards 1907 convention as suspended (your telegram No. 356) and will raise no objection to Persia withdrawing her recogni tion thereof (your telegram No. 365). 3. His Majesty’s Government agree to revision of customs tariff (vour telegram No. 40). - 4. His Majesty’s Government will welcome Persian delegate to the Peace Conference provided that other non-belligerent Powers are represented on it. 5. His Majesty’s Government will give financial assistance to Persian Government (within limits indicated in your telegram No. 3(??). 6. Diplomatic situation would be much strengthened if this declaration could be followed by Prench-American declaration, which Prench Minister learns is under discussion. As it will be essential to give money to a friendly Cabinet immediately, should I, as regards point 5, be authorised to make a considerable advance say up to tomans 200,000 pending negotiation of definite arrangement.

Following is my appreciation of situ- oXAjLfXbj It is well known by Persians generally that we have no evil intention towards Persia and that our policy of last 11 years, which has been un friendly in their eyes at leastiwas the result of Russian pressure lor^ which we ourselves (?) were after all innocent as will be easy to explain. ,,They (?) realise our friendship (?) but they want some visible sign of it from us and— infringement of—policy was fostered by propaganda of enemy. There is no doubt of the existence of a deep routed suspicion among Persians generally of all our actions in Kasvin, and we continue to do things which tend to increase this suspicion, e.g, despatch of Dunsterville mission without any sort of explanation of its objects to Persian Government. We thus play into hands of pro-German clique of politicians who are not supported after ajl by all 3 sections of democrats but to whom our actions afford invaluable aid towards winning over all democrats. In my opinion no section of Persians has slightest hope of Germany or Turkey being able to assist Persia, and in support of this attention is invited to Kuchik Khan’s reply to Obaidulla (Minister’s telegram 14 5, February 24th). Majority of Persians are convinc ed that it is only by coming to an understanding with us that Persia can maintain her independence. Russia has ceased to count; Turkey is Persia’s hereditary enemy; Germany has failed to keep her promises and is too far away to render material assistance in any case. Of course German gold can secure some support so long as there is doubt as to sincerity of our friendly intentions. But it is fully realised that we alone can give them effective financial assistance 1 1 % . 1 ^ iIq : m He ' ' s' si si 5x051 The next question of the greatest importance to the nationalists is that of South Persia Rifles. Our assurance that we will agree to the removal of our officers after the war, is too indefinite a date to the Persian mind. Rue if we agree to their replacement by officers of some heutral power to be agreed on by ns and Persia, and forthwith commence negotiations with a view to obtaining such officers as soon as possible, this question can, I believe, be amicably settled. War may be over before officers can be selected but fact that negotia tions have been begun towards getting them will go a long way to kill the suspicion against us which exists. Then, if our troops are withdrawn from Shiraz, Kerman to either Bandar Abbas or Kuh Malik-Siah, this will be to Persians a further proof of our intentions. ^ I should explain that my appreciation is based on the belief that our desire is to avoid use of force because (a) it would entail dissipation of our Military strength without adequate compensating advantages ; ^ (b) it is our honest desire to respect rights of small nations ; Hence it seems to me imperative that we should leave untried no reason able measure, to secure the safeguarding of our interests in Persia by friendly means before having recourse to force which ultima ratio it will always be in our power to use if other means fails. Whatever policy we adopt should be put into force forthwith and with whole heart. In three months which have passed since Cox suggested reversal of our policy not only have we achieved nothing we have lost ground. I believe policy of honest friendship to hold out good Hope ot success, but I am convinced that success cannot be obtained if we continue to employ as instruments of that policy the same individuals who have been employed to enforce our former policy, Marling is so absolutely identified m minds of Persians with our former policy of supporting Russia’s aggressive action m Persia, that I am convinced that with best will in world he will be unable to conciliate them. I make this statement with utmost deference and only because ip is my sincere conyiction and because in my opinion political interests more important than any personal interests are at stake. Unds.

On February 23rd Officer Commanding, Abadeh, received information that a band of Boir Ahmadi robbers was blocking the road near Yazdikhast. One troop South Persia Cavalry and one company South Persia Infantry under Captain Duggan left Abadeh same day. On 24th February marched 22 miles into Yazdikhast, where local reports stated 10 robbers w T ere camped 4 miles further on. Duggan pushed on with one troop and was followed by 35 infantry. Duggan came on to camp of nearly 200 robbers and had to retire fighting until 35 infantry came up when robbers were drawn off and retired into hills. Cap tain Fraser with reinforcements from Abadeh reached Yazdikhast 27th Febru- JUov-c ary and followed up tracks of robbers, but snow bound hills stopped persuit and robbers had retired altogether. Robbers had cut telegraph wires which were subsequently repaired. Boir Ahmadis were lying in wait for a big caravan of Zieglers.

I am told by Russian Minister that Baratoff has received instructions from Tiflis to retain such forces as he can to keep open Kasvin-Enzeli road and maintain contact with British force at Kermanshah. It is very doubtful to me whether any of his troops would oppose Bolsheviks in however small force.

We have it on excellent authority that Sulaiman Mirza, Persian democrat, now at Zohab near Kasishirin is in close touch with Toherkassof, Kussian Consul, Kermanshah. Sulaiman was lately engaged is espionage for Germans and Turks on Kermanshah front and he recently met and conferred with Toherkassof. Sulaiman is said to be shortly expecting a visit from Druffel, the German Political Officer from Kifri. Ends. As Bowlandson is unaware of the source of this information, it has been sent to him at Hamadan inform as above. It has also been repeated in the same form to Minister, Tehran, and Kennion by Cox. I recommend the recall of Toherkassof from Kermanshah. 47-A. Telegram P., No. X.-6549, dated the 15th (received 16th) February 1918.

Deference my X.-4959 of November 26th, 1917, to Director, Military Intel ligence, London, and Chief of the GeneralStaff, Delhi, a small column moved out from Khanikin on February 8th and arrested the Persian democrat Sulaiman Mirza referred to in my above quoted wire. He has been for some time acting as agent for German Intelligence Officer at Kifri and living with the Sinjabis. He was captured close to the frontier 8 miles north-east of Qasr-i-Shirin. We have secret evidence that up to the time of his capture he has-been actively working for them. Owing to the fact that he is an important democrat, reference was made to Stokes, Tehran, as to whether policy of His Majesty’s Government indicated that he should be liberated and sent to Tehran as favourable to democrats or treated as a prisoner of war. In his reply Stokes agrees that a certain amount of risk of playing into German hands is involved by despatching him to Tehran, but that we should take the risk if our object is to conciliate democrats and especially the pro-German section. I agree with this view. On the other hand in Minister’s No. 57 of February 12th, his latest proposal indi cates clearly that he still advocates policy of force as opposed to that of conciliation of democrats. It would appear that there is urgent need of a clearer definition of His Majesty’s Government’s policy and I suggest reference on the subject be made to Foreign Office. The retention of Stokes at Tehran might be reconsidered should a policy of force be decided on. Am detaining Sulaiman Mirza here pending your reply. As news of his arrest has reached Tehran and may lead to protest which it is desirable to forestall, I request an early decision as to his disposal. 47-B.

I have no documents mvself. They are all in Orton s possession. Shall I ask him to send them to you for scrutiny. This is with reference to your telegram 235-S, 52 Review of events in Fars during 1916-1917. When His Highness the Barman Farma was nominated as Governor- General of Pars, m May 1916,1 was actually in Tehran on my way to Ke^ manshahto take up mv appointment there as Consul. Havingf however pre- shafteer^ ni^ hf ni fm eSS from 1904 to 1906 at Kerman- J i ls Ma 3 est y s Minister obtained the sanction of the Foreign Office and of the Government of India to my appointment as Consul at Shiraz. At this time, the position was roughly as follows : The rebel Gendarmerie force had been defeated by the Kawam the old Kawam had acc,dentally been killed by a fall from his horse, his son who sne ceeded him, had, during his father’s lifetime, been.on bad terms with the latter and had become associated with the Democrat party, though not I believe to’ the extent of becoming pro-German and anti-British. On the death of bis father, however, the young Kawam (then about 27 or 28 years old) realised folfowed'bf hh ffither. 11 aSSOciatin S himself with the Pro-British line of action£ Before the Kawam’s arrival in Shiraz, Yavar, Fath-ul-Mulk, who had been put in ^ prison for his pro-English proclivities, was released, and in his turn Jie imprisoned the Swedish Gendermerie Officers, Captain Angmann and Armourer Enksen, and those Persian officers and men who had taken a KS rNo^mber“ ^ M! * jeSt ' y ’ S C ° MUl ^ ^ Briti8 ' 1 reSidentS He thus became Commandant of the force, but his position was none too secure There was but little money to pay the men, and Eath-ul-Mulk took what he could get fronyhe Finance Department, and in addition received certain sums from His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran. The German Consul, Wustrow, had fled just before Fath-ul-Mnlk effected the change m the situation. The various parties of German, Austrian, Turkish and Afghans who had concentrated on Shiraz, were made prisoners on arrival here. At first they were allowed a certain amount of freedom of movement and action, but at a later period the Kawam, who had taken charge of them, took more stringent precautions. These enemy bands were in a very miserable state, having been robbed a nd met with persistent hostility as they marched through the country. Dr. Schroeder, who tried to escape towards Bakhtiari, had hisbaeffajre looted and was severely wounded and brought back to Shiraz. ^ Thus, at the time His Highness was making preparations to leave Tehran, Shiraz was in the hands of the Kawam and Fath-ul-Mulk both of whom were receiving money from us, and their combined forces dominated the town. The Soulat-ed-Douleh was with his tribes on the border of Fars-Ispahan in their usual summer quarters. ^ * Both the Kawam and the Soulat were sending telegrams to the Farman Farma in Tehran, professing their obedience to his wishes and to the Government. The Gendarmerie, though obedient, were ill-paid and badly disciplined and not in the least to be trusted. i Indeed, it may be taken for granted that neither the Soulat, the Kawam or Fath-ul-Mulk were much more than lukewarm in their professions of friendship, and their obedience to the Farman Farma and their readiness to help ourselves were due entirely to the fact that the German cause at that time seemed to be a losing one. German money however was still coming in, and German influences were still sufficiently strong to prevent anything like whole-hearted adherence to one side or the other. The sympathies of the Kawam were undoubtedly more with us than 1 was the case with the Soulat, who even at this late date is still inclined to doubt our power to finally defeat the Germans, while Fath-ul-Mulk had a keen desire to serve the side which would pay him best, and that he believed to be ourselves. The people of Fars—or rather, of Shiraz—were very tired of the state of anarchy and disorder that had prevailed for about eight years, and were ready to welcome any stable Government that would bring peace and quiet, but unhappily there were many people interested in preventing this state of affairs being brought about—the Democrats, subsidized by the Germans, and the majority of the Clergy, were bent on making trouble. Such was the state of affairs while the Farman Farma was busy in Tehran collecting a small force of about 450 men, with a couple of machine guns supplied by the Legation. His Highness reached Ispahan early in August, and started southwards on August 24th, accompanied by myself, Mr. Bristow of His Majesty’s Con sular Service, Mr Gardner and Mr. Walter of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Air, Newton of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and Lieutenants Weldon and Connolly of the South Persia Rifles. Shortly before our departure, jji (Jo / l \mmmmm the possibility of an attack on Ispahan arose, and Brigadier-General SirP. Sykes was instructed to bring his Column to that place from Yezd, and reached there early in September. Meanwhile, the Barman Parma marched South, and at Kumisha was met by the Soulat, who came in to pay his res pects. Por some reason, the latter was either not satisfied with his reception or was not impressed by the size of His Highness’s forces, and proceeded rapidly to Shiraz, where he 'used his influence to raise an agitation against the Parman Parma, the result of which was seen some days later when we reached Dehbid. Meanwhile, we marched to Abadeh, where the German, Peter Paschen, was handed over to me by the Deputy Governor of the town, Mahommed Ali Khan, Kashgai, a cousin of the Soulat, and who, when Path-ul-Mulk succeeded in imprisoning the rebel Gendarme Officers, himself arrested Paschen, Yavar Path Ali Khan and some prominent Democrats who were at Abadeh at the time. We reached Dehbid on the 6th September, and there received telegrams signed by Soulat, Kawam and Path-ul-MulK saying that the Deputy Governor had been made a prisoner, and that His Highness would be opposed by force if he proceeded to Shiraz, though the Consul and his Staff were invited to go on, with a promise that we should not be molested. It seemed too risky, and the whole party moved back to Abadeh, whence negotiations were opened, with the result that Path-ul-Mulk came to Abadeh, and we marched on again, leaving Abadeh early in October, the Kawam meeting us three marches north of the town, while the Soulat moved out and joined his tribes. It appeared afterwards that this little coup d’etat had been engineered by Prince Akbar Mirza, Saram-ed-Douleh, son of the Zil-es-Sultan, who wished to get the Governorship of Pars for himself. _ We met with a very good reception on our arrival, though the Gendar merie were in a very sulky and insubordinate state, while there were many persons who would willingly have created a disturbance if they had not known that General Sykes’ Column—ol which the size was not known and was generally very much exaggerated—would soon be on its way to Shiraz. The Gendarmerie had been promised that if they remained loyal they would be incorporated in the newly formed South Persian Bifles, and would receive pay from the first of the Zodiacal month of Somboleh, and as much of their arrears of pay as possible should be settled. We arrived at Shiraz on the 15th October, and everythins* remained quiet in the Province until and after the arrival of General Sykes ^ and his Column on the 12th November. The German and Austrian prisoners were in the Ark, and the Turks and Afghans were in Police Station in the town. A Persian Officer and some men of the South Persia Bifles were sent to Kazerun, and brought in from there a gun, and later a British Officer went there to pay the men of the force. Late in December, news was received that Nasr-ed-Diwan, the Khan of Kazerun, had seized the South Persia Bifles garrison and one gun which it had been impossible to bring in to Shiraz. It w r as decided by General Sykes to send out a mixed force of Indian troops and South Persia Bifles, to march towards Kazerun. This force met with determined opposition on Xmas day, 1916, and wns obliged to retire on Shiiaz, bringing back Captain WIttkugel, of the South Persia Bifles mortally wounded, J This reverse naturally roused up all the anti-British feeling in the town of Shiraz, and strengthened the Khans on the Bushire road in their opposition. Caravans and posts had been coming in from Bushire, but these were now stopped, and all traffic now ceased. Grave doubts were entertained in the minds of sfl fli-c' frf the officers of General Sykes’ Staff as to the reliabilityor^feftfiseofthe and his principal adviser and confidant, Miraa^Mustafa Khan. Stories, apparently well founded, were told -Ooinnel Hunter, Chief Staff Officer, that Mirza Mustafa was planning and plotting against the safety of the English force inShiraz, and, on the urgent requisition of the Staff, as a matter of military necessity, I sent for Mirza Mustafa and told him he must remain in the Consulate until his departure for Tehran could be arranged. As a matter of fact, no definite charges were ever formulated against him, but I considered, in view of the steps which had been taken against him, it would be better for him to go, and he accordingly left for Tehran. His departure had, I believe, a good effect on the Democrats in the town, and affairs quieted down. In January 1917, the Kawam started on an expedition towards the Shibkuh region, to make his authority felt, and from there he proceeded towards Baharlu, to punish the recalcitrant Arabs. In Shibkuh, he seems to have punished mainly the persons who had already paid their revenue to the Darya Begi, and to have failed to punish persons implicated in attacks on British subjects. His time in these parts appears to have been spent mainly in collecting revem^ for himself, and his methods elicited strong reproof from the Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who very justly complained that we had not provided funds for an expedition merely to enable the Kawam to collect large sums of money from persons who had already paid their revenues to the Persian Government, and who were on good terms with the British authorities in the Gulf. The Kawam, on the other hand, complained that the Darya Begi had no right to interfere with the collection of Shibkuh revenues, Shibkuh being under his, the Kawam’s, Governorship. He also explained that the letters of the Deputy Resident arrived too late to allow him to take action against the persons who had inflicted injury to British subjects. However, the latter portion of his expedition was more satisfactory. He dealt very satisfactorily with the Baharlus and various other Arabs who had for a long time been raiding in the direction of the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road, to such good effect that no further robberies occurred on that road during the summer of 1917. He had with him a small force of South Persia Rifles, but without a British Officer. He returned to Shiraz about April, and remained in the town till towards the end of the year, when he again proceeded on tour, this time accompanied by a force of South Persia Rifles Cavalry and Infantry, with British Officers. The Arabs towards the end of the year, showed signs of again getting out of hand, and it is to be hoped that the Kawam will be able to inflict sufficient punishment on them to reduce them to order. The Kawam is evidencing as keen a desire to get rich quick as anyone else, which is no more than saying he is a Persian. Both in his case, however, and in that of the Soulat, within reasonable limits, I believe it to be in our interests to pay them well if they will only keep their tribesmen in order, for otherwise it would mean continual expeditions against Arabs or Kashgais, (both of them sufficiently formidable opponents, numerous, fairly well-armed and brave) not only costly in money, but requiring the use of Indian troops, of which the numbers in Southern Persia are very limited. In the early Spring, prices of food-stuffs engaged attention. Por over ten years, the country had been disturbed, and for six years locusts had annually taken heavy toll of the crops. The arrival of the Indian force, as well as that of His Highness the Parman Parma, which, though together numbering in all some 1,500 or 1,699 persons, yet was accom panied by probably the same number or more, of mules and horses, added to the scarcity of food, a fairly large amount of wheat was imported from Bakhtiari and round about Abadeh, but the people of Shiraz and the surrounding villages were starving. To meet the scarcity, with the sanction of His Majesty’s Government, 750 tons of flour was imported from India via Bunder Abbas and Lingah. A certain proportion of this was stolen by the carriers en route, but enough remained to save the city frbln-actjial starvation. The total loss on the transaction, after deducting price of purchase, and carriage to Shiraz, and selling it at rates approximating to local prices, amounted to Tomans 12,000, which at the then rate of exchange equalled Rs. 60,000. This importation of flour, besides relieving actual distress, was of distinct political value, as demonstrating to the people that we were anxious to assistx TU?

Had it not been for this assistance, I am convinced there would have been food riots, which could only have been suppressed by force, and any such display of force would have been seized upon all over the country with a view to stirring up the bitterest feelings of the country against the “ Invaders During January, one German Officer and two Austrian privates managed to escape from the Ark, the Governor’s palace. There was no doubt that the remainder were in correspondence with Wassmuss at Ahram and with other sympathizers outside, and it was decided to send all the prisoners—Germans, Turks, Austrians and Afghans, away. After some correspondence, it was decided to send the Germans, Turks and Austrians northwards, to be interned in Russia, while the Afghans were sent to India. The move of the former was accomplished without incident, the European prisoners being sent under an Indian guard, while the Turks were escorted by the Farman Farma’s own troops, and the whole party, consisting of 12 Germans, 30 Austrians, 2 Swedes and 8 Turks, were handed over to a Russian escort on the borders of Fars. Ot the Afghans, three managed to escape on their way down, but were recaptured by the Kawam’s men, and the whole party of 12 arrived safely at Lingah and were sent on to India. In February 1917, reinforcements for the Indian Column arrived consist ing of the 16th Rajputs and some Burma Mounted Infantry and with them came a regular Headquarter Staff for the whole Force, Indian and South Persia Rifles. Up to that time, General Sykes’ Staff had consisted of Lieute nant-Colonel Hunter and Captain Thorburn, I.M.S., and the former was now appointed to command the Fars Brigade. The training of the South Persia Rifles was now taken steadily in hand, with the British Non-Commissioned Officers sent for the purpose from India. Old men were weeded out, recruits in large numbers enlisted, and the whole force rearmed and day by day some improvement _ was to be seen, and the South Persia Rifles began, with the issue of regular rations and pay and with sympathetic treatment, to feel their way and show signs that they were something more than the disorganised and discontented rabble that they had been on our arrival.* During the Spring and Summer, in conjunction with the Indian troops and occasionally alone, they had successful encounters with robber bands, and gradually the ol^ idea that the “ Gendarmes ” might be despised began to change, and this idea may now be said to have nearly disappeared, and it is to be hoped that the force may have a chance in the future to prove that it is very much to be counted on. Early in May, negociations were opened with the Soulat with a view to clearing up the situation in Razerun. This he offered to do if he were given the money to pay the men for the necessary force required to overawe Nasr- ed-Diwan and occupy Kazerun and the road from Tang-i-Turkan to Shiraz. Mr. E. Bristow, with Captain Geard, 15th Lancers, were sent out to join the Soulat’s camp, where the former was able to carry through the negociations. It was mostly a matter of money, and this being settled, the Soulat marched into Kazerun, which was evacuated by Nasr-ed-Diwan. A Deputy Governor was placed in the town and guards posted on the road, while the Soulat came down to near Khaneh Zinian to meet General Sykes and myself. During the 3 days we were there, an agreement was drawn up, to tiie effect that the Soulat should guard the road between Tang-i-Turkan an Dasht-i-Arjan for three months, not allowing Nasr-ed-Diwan and one or two other objectionable characters into Kazerun, while we on the other hand promised to give him every possible moral support in his dealings with his tribesmen. The great advantage of this agreement, if kept only moderately reasonably by the Soulat, was that there would be no trouble with the Kashgais during the next six months, which might be looked on as the critical period, during which to recover from the effects of the set back at Dasht-i-Arjan in December 1916, and during which the South Persia Rifles might continue the training in arms and discipline which were sc essential to them.On the whole, the Sonlat performed his part of the bargain sufficiently well. He did not keep Nasr-ed-Diwan out of Kazerun for long, nor did he fulfil certain other terms of his contract, but he did keep his tribe in order, and that alone was worth the money paid to him. During the summer, Indian troops were sent to Dehbid, and u nder Majo r (now Lieutenant-Colonel) Williams, gave a very smart lesson to the Kurshulis, a tribe living about 30 miles to the west of Dehbid, who had considered themselves too strong to be attacked, while other bands of robbers were also punished by the South Persia Rifles garrison of Abadeh. In September, a force of Indian and South Persia Rifles troops were sent to punish the Lashani tribesmen, who had been raiding in the direction of •Kerman and Anar. A force from Kerman assisted in these operations which were brought to a successful conclusion. The Farman Farma was very nervous lest the odium for this expedition should be placed on his shoulders by the Persian Government, although it was pointed out to him that he had himself been called on by the Persian Government to punish these robbers whose depredations extend as far as Khorasan. In the meantime, Colonel Hunter had departed on leave, and the command of the Fars Brigade temporarily devolved on Major Oakes and finally was taken over by Major (now Lieutenant-Colonel) Williams of the Burma Mounted Infantry. . No autumn rain fell in Shiraz, and the prospect looked so bad for the Spring crops that arrangements were made with the Government of India to send flour and wheat to Shiraz via Bunder Abbas, Lingah and Bushire. Towards the end of December, however, good snow and rain fell, with the result of reducing prices and inducing persons who had been holding up their stocks of grain to open their “ ambars” (store-houses). It is to be hoped that the position, provided timely rains fall in the spring, is assured. General Sykes proceeded to India in November to discuss questions con' nected with Southern Persia affairs. The postal arrangements between Shiraz and India have, on the whole, worked fairly satisfactorily. Until early in 1917 posts were sent by the . Kazerun road to Bushire, but in January, the post was robbed. By- an unfortunate accident, various confidential papers connected with our policy towards the Soulat, the Kawam and the Khans on the road had been entrusted to the ordinary post by the Staff and fell into the hands of Wassmuss, and by him were translated, copies being sent to all the persons mentioned in the papers. The remarks contained were not exactly flattering, and their publica tion did not improve cordial relations. A censorship was placed on the Pers’an posts by the Khans, or as they called it, the “ Millat-i-Kazerun,” at that town. It was therefore decided to open a postal route to Lingah, and with the aid of sowars provided by the Kawam, the post was established, and continued to run for some months, when the wells dried up, and the route had to be abandoned. Posts were then forwarded by caravan to Bunder Abbas via Niriz and Saidabad, but this, though safe, was unsatisfactory, taking from six weeks to two months to arrive, and leaving only prce a month, as against 12 days for the Lingah weekly mail^ and eight days for the Bushire mail, which leaves twice weekly. In time it was found that the mails sent by the Bushire route were no longer being tampered with, and this route was again used, though confidential or secret documents are not entrusted to it. Much work has been done on the roads in the province, from Saidabad to Shiraz, and from Shiraz towards Ispahan—these roads being made into fair weather roads fit for motor traffic except during the rainy seasons. The Indian Telegraph Department have maintained regular traffic by the North route, but the line between Shiraz and Bushire has not been touched, beyond repairs being effected as far as Kazerun. Even this section is generally interrupted, the line being frequently cut by Kashgais.1 consider that a line between Shiraz and Saidabad, thus giving another route to the coast, to be most important, and I trust its construction may not be long delayed. I consider the work done by the whole Staff of the Department has been excellent, and^ I wish to bring the services of Mr. Newton specially to the notice of the Government of India. He accompanied me from Tehran to Shiraz, and has remained here since then up to the present. To his unceasing care and watchfulness is due the good and hard work done by the Telegraph Staff at Shiraz. I would also like to bring prominently to notice the very great services rendered by Mrs. Newton during 1917. There were no trained nurses here, and when Captain Wittkugel of the South Persia Rifles was brought in to Shiraz mortally wounded in the beginning of January 1917, Mr. and Mrs Newton had him brought to their own house, and from then until the 15th of February when Captain Wittkugel died, Mrs. Newton nursed him most devotedly. Again during May and June, Mrs. Newton nursed Major McMahon of the 124tn Baluchistan Infantry, and during October, November and December she nursed Captain Williams, A. C. R. E., both in her own house. As both these officers were severely ill with enteric, it is probable that without Mrs. Newton’s trained services, they would not have recovered. Mrs. Newton has refused any remuneration for these services, and I strongly recommend that she may be accorded some signal mark of appreciation by the Government of India. During the whole period from August 1916 to the end of 1917, Mr. Bristow * of His Majesty’s Consular Service and nominally Vice-Consul at Resht, has assisted me, his services having been lent to me by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Of these services I cannot speak too highly, his tact and good temper has materially assisted me in many crises in dealing with Persian officials, and much of the success of my mission from Tehran to open the Consulate here must be attributed to Mr. Bristow, w ho. has now proceeded to take up the appointment of Consul at Tabriz. In Apiil 1917 the services of Captain R. 0. Geard, 15th Dancers, were lent to me by General Sykes for employment in a political capacity. I sent him with Mr, Bristow to the camp of the Soulat when the latter w 7 as approach ing Kazerun. Captain Geard collected much valuable information, which was forwarded by me to the Intelligence Branch of the South Persia Rifles. Again, later, I sent Captain Geard to the Soul&amp;t’s camp, as a sign that we were ready to give the latter our support should he desire it. On his return. Captain Geard worked in my Office until ordered to join General Sir Percy Cox’s Staff in Mesopotamia. I should also like to bring to notice the valuable assistance given to me in every way by Mr. A. E. Gardner, Manager, and later Accountant of the Shiraz branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia! His services to me during the journey from Ispahan and during the first few months of our stay in Shiraz were very valuable. I wish to record my sincere admiration of and gratitude to His Highness the Earman Earma, for his unfailing courtesy and willingness to help in every way. His Highness has shown without reserve his belief in the British cause, and is in consequence vilined by the press in Tehran as a person who has sold his country. His Highness, on the contrary, is a true patriot, who has realized that if Persia is ever to recover from the slough of despond in wffiich she is sunk, and hope to become a decently governed country, respected by her neighbours, she must seek assistance irom outside. He believes in the possibility of a regeneration of his country with British assistance only, and he believes that in the great struggle between ourselves and Germany, w e will emerge victorious. Eor this reason he has declared himself openly as friendly to us, and has proved it by his acts! He is a Persian, and therefore frequently nervous as to the results of his’ ^ C1 fj 0n » especially now that the Russians have agreed to evacuate the North ot Persia, for His Highness’ principal possessions lie in the north, while his family reside in Tehran. Such nervousness may therefore easily he understood, and allowances made for it, while it is to be hoped that his great and valuable services may be amply compensated at the end of the war. In conclusion, I desire also to record the cordial co-operation in every work in'€ Ur J which I have been engaged of Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., whose intimate knowledge of Persia and Persians have always been at my disposal.

In the case of a notorious robber failure to execute and mere sentence would be considered to be due to timidity and fear of democrats and would increase difficulty of my task both as regards restoration of order and also protection of long and vulnerable Lines of Com munication.

Before statement is made I should like to know as exactly as possible when troops will be able to dominate position as regards movement by Jangalis assisted possibly by Bolshevik soldiery from Resht via Kasvin. Such a movement is always possible, especially as I hear that the enemy officers have arrived Kasvin. Movement by Jangalis alone is improbable. What will be the position, once the statement is made ? Will His Majesty’s Government be satisfied if Persian Government in return for conces sion we are prepared to make agree to recognise South Persia Rifles on its present basis until the end of the war, or will they also require an under taking that Persian Government will endeavour to prevent inroads and acti vities of enemy agents, etc. ? Any Persian Cabinet would wish to avoid latter engagement as by giving it they would be pro r.ata) tanto abandoning their neutrality. : . .. &lt; - .'h c\ The very large legitimate Russian interests in North Persia, political and commercial, will be greatly stirred at appearance of our troops. Do His Majesty’s Government consider understanding arrived at between the two Governments in the early part of the war to the effect that military action by either power would not give pretext for ulterior claims for an extension of that Powers influence (words omitted ?) To me it seems important to conci liate those interests by letting Russians here understand that our influence is purely temporary and that our troops will respect and protect Russians com mercial interests. Such an intimation would have special value for the pur pose of ensuring loyalty of officers of Cossacks division.

(Addressed to Foreign Office, London ; repeated Baghdad.) Threatened, demonstration at Kasvin did not materialise. This was, I believe, due not to any orders of Persian Government, but because extremists want to see what steps we shall take over the Resht outrage, before venturing on further similar acts. b It is reported by Acting Consul, Tabriz, that democrats are becoming more and more menacing towards British in Tabriz. Hence to delay making announcement to Persian Government of our intention to send troops would in my opinion be unwise, even though move ment of troops has not yet, so far as I am aware, begun. It is of course pos sible that Jangalis with Bolshevik aid may attempt coup de vnoin on Tehran, but on the whole, I believe announcement will have sobering effect all over Persia.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Excellency the Viceroy (Foreign and Political Department), Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; repeated to Baghdad.) I doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by moving Indian troops or South Persian Rifles northwards to Ispahan for protecting Legation. Should there be any danger to Legation which I do not anticipate troops at Ispahan would be too far off to give assistance. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan has strongly advocated force of South Persian Rifles being despatched there to establish security of roads and district, condition of which has been exceedingly bad the last few months, due to incompetence and venality of Governor, who has been hand in glove with the brigands. There are 600 Persian Cossacks at Ispahan. But though the Russian Commanding Officer is competent, he has too few Russian officers under him to risk them in pushing home attack on the considerable forces which can be mustered by the brigands and a recent attempt to capture the most powerful robber chief failed, chiefly for that reason. Want of money also handicaps him. If money is forthcoming however, (???) Government Cossacks could I believe deal with the situation. If not, and if necessary, South Persian Rifles force can be spared action contemplated might usefully be undertaken. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Consul-General it would be welcomed by the local commercial community and would not cause any fric tion with Cossacks. Zil-es-Sultan family would of course see in it protection for their interests as against Bakhtiari depredations and to that extent it would be resented by tribe. do/ * 6 - (FSW As regards Kurdish Levies system of road guards Colonel Kennion worked for Kussians had some success and could probably be usefully undertaken again.

All that His Majesty’s Government ask that Persian Govern ment should show general friendliness to British interests, take measures against the return of enemy agents to Persia and formally recognise the South Persia Rifles until end of war. ? On their part His Majesty’s Government have been prepared to give liberal financial assistance to Persia; to favour creation after the war of uniform military force for the whole country ; to treat Anglo-Russian Conven tion of 1907 as in suspense pending formal discussion of abrogation with properly constituted Russian Government; to allow Persia to defer her recogni tion of it; to recognise revision of Customs tariff; and to welcome presence of Persian representatives at international conference to which non-belligerents might be invited. Persian Government have not yet .accepted these offers which are still open. On the other hand lawlessness is rife ; Turks have entered Azerbaijan ; Jangalis have severed connection between Enzeli and Tehran and have seized the British Vice-Consul and Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia at Resht ; and whole of North-West Persia is exposed to hostile movements which con stitute serious menace to the common interests of Great Britain and Persia which Persian Government are either unable or unwilling to protect. His Majesty’s Government have therefore ordered despatch to North- Western Persia a sufficient force to meet this danger. Point to which troops will advance will depend on circumstances. Every possible care will be taken to avoid any infringement of Persian independence and integrity or interference in internal administration and British force will be withdrawn as soon as circumstances permit and in any case at end of war.

I am sending two messengers to Tiflis, one vii Tabriz and the other via, Baku. No news whatever from Caucasus has reached Acting Consul, Tabriz. Telegraph and postal communications have been interrupted for fortnight, while large section of railway has been destroyed. Owing to lack of petro leum no more trains are leaving for Julfa. I am informed by Manager of Indo-European Telegraph Company that tribesmen have all turned robbers. Company has already authorise him to spare no expense in maintaining line. Plan adopted is to send out man with repairing instruments and money to conciliate robbers, when necessary. He is frequently robbed of all his money however before he reaches the spot.

Persian Cossacks have proved themselves incapable of restoring order. A force under Colonel Khabaroff(?) recently left the town in order to put an end to Riza Juzdani’s depredations. Column had no guns with it. Riza could doubtless have been captured or slain and his gang annihilated had Cossacks closed. This they failed to do, and ;Riza got away having suffered losses just sufficient to exasperate him.2 u Cossacks have now returned to town leaving Riza defeated but not disheartened and he will probably soon be a greater nuisance than ever. Having closed their warehouses in town merchants are asking that order I may be restored on roads. I have been asked by many who have seen me when South Persia Rifles may be expected; fearing the reprisals of democrats, however, they will not openly ask for a garrison. For the present 500 would be ample and mere establishment of such a force here without further measures would greatly improve situation and would prove that we are prepared to take efficient measures for our safety. No democrat with whom I have spoken has attempted to argue that ym should not be justified in taking such a step after our experience in PerSa j and Persians in this war. They all admit that we shall be extremely generous : if we permit discussions of question of South Persia Rifles after war. Thisjis with reference to my telegram 23 (223 ?) 1917. 171 Telegram P., No. X.-6112, dated the 24th January 1918.* From—The General Officer Commanding^ Force “ D,” Baghdad, To—The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, London.

Tn letter dated 3rd January Liaison Officer with Raratow at Hamadan , states that he estimates Russians will not have finished clearing out of Persia until April owing to paucity of ships on the Caspian. Aeroplanes message tc-day from Liaison Officer with Bicharakov at Ker- manshah states that it will be impossible for Bicharakov to increase his partisan force as long as Baratov remains in command. About one-third of Bichara- kov’s detachment is expected to leavelhim and the whole Russian army is rotton with discontent. All officers are panic striken and he can reckon on obtain ing no more to assist him at Kermanshah. Liaison Officer also reports that there is an inaprovement in the political situation at Kermanshah and in order to avoid giving as a pretext for occupying the town the democrats and moder ates have effected a reconciliation. Hopes are expressed that we shall not replace the Russians whose departure has occasioned general rejoicing.

From—The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D,” To—The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, London. (Repeated Chief of the General Staff, Delhi.) .. In continuation my 6112. The following description of the situation! given m letters dated Kermanshah, January 27tb, from Stokes and from Clut- terbuck, who is Liaison Officer with Bicharakov, received Baghdad February 1st. # Although Baratov will succeed in holding together a certain number of his men Bicharakhov states they will only be attracted by very high pay and wm be undisciplined and useless. Bicharakov’s own men are also infected and will inevitably go to pieces also before long. Russian retirement which is still m progress is only prevented from becoming a rout by Bicharakov’s presence. He was moving to Hamadan to see how things are there but held out no hope whatever of anything better than as above stated. His idea is to rally best officers and men he can find and take them to Caucasus and there raise new force which he is* confident of doing. He would like letters from British authorising him to do this and considers these troops could be usefully p, employed on anyf Russian front but not a ge gure. j n Persia. His proposal therefore is3 that after seeing conditions in Hamadan he shall return to Baghdad and get instructions from me and shall then withdraw through Persia taking with him all bis men including those still with us here. In this movement he would probably act as rearguard to the whole Russian Porce. It is stated , by Stokes that all parties would welcome removal of Russians from Persia and I agree with this. Kennion’s view that British forces are better kept out of Kermanshah is also supported by Stokes. If kept ready at Qasr-i- *6roup undecipherable. shirin the y could always forestall Turkish movement on Kermenshah.* Per the present at any rate I also agree. 1,400 local inhabitants are employed on relief works on Kermanshah road with satisfactory results and tribal situation is good and gives no reason to anticipate any serious trouble on tAs cabled road between Qasr-i-Shirin and Kerman shah I propose as summary! to above to get Bicharakov to Baghdad and I suggest that I shall then inform him that so far as we are concerned we encourage him in his proposal to raise troops in Caucasus and we make no obstacle to his withdrawal from Persia. I therefore request your orders accordingly. 173 Telegram P., No. 139-S., dated the 11th February 1918.

Cabinet while professing itself desirous of coming to an understanding- 'with us is showing no inclination to expedite our conversations to conclusion 5 and before we reach any real result Eussian troops will clearly have withdrawn’ Persian Government will do nothing to secure road to Enzeli with negotiations still proceeding. Even supposing that our conversations end in a satisfactory conclusmn 1 do not believe they could do anything really eftective, still less that they would ever venture to bar passage of German emissaries into and through Persia. I venture to urge therefore that we must seriously consider undertaking these two tasks ourselves. I am disposed to believe that it will suffice to hold road as far as Kasvm, but it must be in strength considerably greater than is necessary merely to police the road, and there must be sufficient force at Kasvin to mpre^ both on Pehran and Jangalis in Gilan that we cannot be trifled with. Of Ja,ngali movement which has attained present proportions chiefly from lack of opposition, I have no great opinion ; indeed I am convinced that with our own troops m Persia it would be easy to destroy their power bv stirring up chiefs of surrounding tribes against them. * If His Majesty’s Government decide to take this step, it should be accom- pamed at the same time by a declaration of the points on which we are prepared to meet Persian wishes, and an explanation that necessity for defending our own interests against enemy machinations has forced our action on us There will be a certain amount of protest no doubt, but provided we do not stop at half measures there will be nothing worse; indeed I anticipate a degree of rehef at seeing that we are forcing Persia out of the vacillation which intelligent class recognise as fatal to her. As matters now stand we appear in a very ambiguous light On the one hand we are professing our desire to respect Persia’s integrity and independence; on the othe? by such actions as the extension of our cordon along the eastern frontier sending armoured cars m conjunction with General Dunsterville, arrival of militmf (establishment ?) with Stokes, and financing Eussian troo P r so as to ktep them in Persia ,we are showing a complete disregard for Persian neutrality As circumstances are likely to compel us to use force sooner or later it would seem better to act at once, rather than drag on negotiations entailing lever- increasing concessions. &amp; ■ cvcil Q 181 Telegram P. ; No. 103-F., dated the 12th (received lothj February 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty^s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office ; repeated Baghdad.) Proposed utilization of Cossack Division is impracticable because— (1) It is scattered all over North Persia (see telegram No. N. D.-16, January 21st, from Military Attache) and in various contingents which could not be withdrawn without imperilling local situation. (2) To employ force of Cossacks now in Tehran on Kermanshah-Enzeli road would leave Tehran in hands of gendarmerie, a very doubtful body of strong nationalist tendencies under Germanophil sway. (3) Proposed replacement of Russians by British officers would never§ be accepted by Persian Government nor would they agree to introduction of a few British officers into the Division except under pressure of our own troops at Kasvin or nearer. If road to Caucasus is to be kept open it must be done with ourlown forces. There would be considerable political advantages however if we could secure Russian co-operation say from Manjil to Resht and thus by retention of Russian forces preserve appearance of joint action as regards Russia and Caucasus.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister^ Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office, 76 ; repeated Baghdad and General Dunsterville at Hamadan.) As a result of private reports from Noel and Macdonell and of conversa tions with Offley Shore and a Russian officer familiar with Caucasus and just returned thence, I venture to submit following observations on South Caucasian position. The objects in view in those regions are (1) holding of front in north east Asia Minor, and (2) scheme of South Caucasian federation. Efforts we have made have been hitherto almost wholly military. As regards (1) our efforts have had some measure of success in the formation of military units composed almost exclusively of Christians, chiefly, Armenian. This apparent preference for Christians which indiscreet conduct of Armenians has accen tuated has given rise to suspicion among the Tartars of the Caucasus that our policy is anti-Islamic, a suspicion which enemy agents have diligently exploited with result that Tartars in some places, hitherto comparatively friendly, are now almost hostile. The breach between the two principal elements in Caucasus, Armenian and Tartar, has thus been widened, and the policy we have pursued for object (2), no doubt for excellent military considerations of forming national ” forces from these two races and the Georgians has also tended to disunion, with the result that the possibility of federation is becoming daily less and less. General feeling of Southern Caucasus is strongly in favour of peace, the Tartars being pro-Turkish ; the Georgians solely in their own interests ; and the Russian Armenians far from an Jous to take up the quarrel of their kindred in Turkey. The Turkish Armenians are obliged to fight as they have massacred Turks by way of reprisal and they alone with a small Russisn element desire to keep up struggle. We ourselves are committed to support Turkish-Armenia and safe com munications are essential for that purpose. If, as I understand, this cannot be done directly from Baghdad, we have to ensure the road through Persia to Baku. There is no doubt that enemy activity among the Jangalis is aimed at cutting our communications at or near Resht. Bicharakof’s partisans excepted, there is every prospect that all Russian troops will be withdrawn within a very short time. If, however, a compara tively small number of troops could be spared from Mesopotamia, they could deal with this difficulty Jangalis included. The appearance of British troops will evoke no more than formal protests and encourage our friends to come forward and put end to the partly fictitious anti-British agitation. The real problem seems to begin at Enzeli and Baku, where we first encounter real Caucasian. Access to Baku by sea is not absolutely secure as Caspian fleet is decidedly Bolshevik, Baku itself is strongly Bolshevik and the considerable Tartar element is being activity worked on by German agents like Zugmayer who with (other?) secret agents (captured near?) Shiraz is now at liberty. Neither Provisional Government nor Staff at Tiflis can do anything, and as we cannot send troops—a measure which Offley Shore is certain would be as successful in the Caucasus as in Persia—we must use political means. _ These conditions seem to require General Dunsterville’s mission should be political at least as much as military.

What role Stokes is intended to play there I do not know precisely, but assuming that it is to be much the same as I had contemplated for him, I suggest best course would now be to abandon idea of any separate Mission from here and to let 'Stokes work it from Tehran. We could supply him if necessary with 2 or 3 officers from here to be employed by him as he thinks best for the purpose in view after consulting with His Majesty’s Minister.

The considerations which prompted General Officer Commanding in last paragraph of his telegram 589l, January 13th, have not been quite understood by His Majesty’s Government. It is not a question of control of general policy hut routine working arrangements of this force. A column of this force is already in Persian territory at Qasrishirin. Officer Commanding has to deal promptly with cases of raiding of caravans or convoys and cutting of telegraph lines by local tribesmen. He takes his orders from General Headquarters here and requires a Political Officer from here to assist him in his dealings with tribes. As there is no telegraph between Qasrishirin and Kermanshah, it is impracticable for Officer Commanding to deal with Tehran or Kermanshah in these matters; nor is it practicable for General Officer Commanding, Baghdad, to handle Khanikin tribal affairs through me and the affairs of the same tribes in Qasrishirin through the Minister. Even were Kennion to transfer his headquarters to Qasrishirin—and this he can hardly do as long as there is no telegraph—he would practically have to function as a Political Officer of this forcg in regard to relations between the force and local tribes. The General Officer Commanding meant nothing more than this. The general policy of His Majesty’s Government must of course be directed from Tehran. It is very necessary for me to know what it is. Once it is defined however I have no desire to participate in the control of it. If we are to save ourselves avoidable trouble and misunderstanding it is necessary in my opinion that we should have authority to explain that the location of our troops at Qasrishirin and our roadmaking activity up to the Tak-i-Girreh do not presage any British advance into Persia or any designs on its integrity but are merely temporary measures, organised with the Persian Gov ernment’s concurrence to bar the passage of enemy expeditions through Persian territory.

In return I have received note from Minister for Foreign Affairs. After stating that Persian Government have resolved to have immediately an uniform force^organised under officers from neutral State, he brings the following points as being Persian Government’s objects to my notice :— ^ 1. Assistance in evacuation of Persia by Foreign troops and handins* over of South Persia Rifles to Persian Government. 2. Abrogation of 1907 convention and abolition of entire effects of 1911 ultimatum. 3. Acceptance of participation of Persian representatives in Peace Conference. , Til'4. Revision of Customs Tariff. 5. Payment of whole surplus Customs revenues as w T ell as past and future instalments of moratorium without any conditions. ^ On seeing Minister for Poreign Affairs yesterday, I asked him whether his note meant that Persian Government intend to negotiate with us on the basis of my note of January 23rd. After some shuffling he replied in the affirmative and said that he would call on me February 4th for the purpose. I told him that Persia was asking much of us and in return we also had requirements, viz.^ that South Persia Rifles would be treated as a Persian Force on same footing as the Cossack Brigade was in the past, and that Persian Gov ernment must understand clearly that our financial support in whatever shape we gave it would be continued just so long as Persia maintains a sincerely friendly attitude. With reference to No. 1 of the individual points raised His Excellency said that it would be great step if w r e could agree as to the nationality of the Officers ; I assented, and I would suggest for your consideration that we might agree that when choice has been made, chief of them should come to Persia to study conditions of the existing force. As regards 5 I told him Imperial Bank of Persia could not out of con sideration lor its shareholders be asked to surrender income of customs receipts already encashed and the proposal could not he entertained. His Excellency tacitly acquiesced. Our refusal will certainly lead to a modification of Persian regarding financial support ; but I gathered that abolition of mixed Financial Commission is a capital point with them. On the other 3 points little was said. This is with reference to my telegram 62. 151 Telegram P., No. 2, dated the 4th (received 5th) February 1918.

It is most important that this business should be done thoroughly. I hope you will recommend loan of guns. I am told by Cox that he believes that General Officer Commanding-in-Chief would comply with request if it came from you and Government of India with a copy to him. 152 Telegram P., No. 86-F., dated the 5th (received 6th) February 1918.

From—-His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, r To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to the Foreign Office, No. 80 ; sent to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad.) On February 4th, Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me and after beat ing about the bush said that the Cabinet’s suggestion for meeting our wishes as regards the maintenance of the South Persia Bifl.es till end of the war with the Persian Government’s full recognition was that we should agree to withdraw all our troops now in Persia including those in Sistan and at the ports. I said that Eis Majesty's Government were unlikely to agree to removing ordinary Consular escorts and that so far as I was aware we had no troops in the Gulf except at Bushire, and that the Afghan frontier cordon and the force guarding the oilfields must unquestionably be retained. His Excellency replied that Consular guards were not in question ; and that the cordon was largely madb up of local levies, they could perhaps be treated as part of South Persia Bifles.As to oilfields force he expressed no opinion. He declared that if we would agree to this, the Persian Government would use every means to prevent enemy agents entering or working in Persia I pointed out that Turkish frontier froin Kasr-i-Shirin to Ararat was open and asked what measures Persian Government could take. He said that Cossack division would he employed. I rejoined that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps feel some confidence so long as ; the Russian officers remained but that circumstances were readily conceivable in which these officers would disappear; indeed the Persian Government mi»ht themselves bring this about and it was even said that they were thinking of doing rso: His Excellency replied that the Cabinet desired to retain division and enquired whether His Majesty’s Government attached great importance to retaining Russian officers. I answered that they considered preservation of only disciplined force in North Persia as very essential and that there was no one to take place of Russians. On proposal as a whole I declined to express any opinion. It is clear that the idea underlying this proposal is to enable the Persian Government toipose before public and (pro?) Turks and Germans as having now regained respect for their neutrality, in order to be able to protest against future violations of it by whomsoever committed and to justify any conse quent action taken by them. Whether we could agree to the suggestion from a military point of view is largely matter on which Officer Commanding, South Persia Rifles’ views must carry weight. As regards Ears and Kerman, however, moral support acquired from recognition by Persian Government would in my own opinion about counterbalance loss of material support involved by withdrawal of our troops. Presuming South Persia Rifles could stand alone and that some effective arrangement can also be made on eastern frontier suggestion seems to me to deserve consideration. Should it be entertained by His Majesty’s Government I submit we should stipulate for maintenance of Cossack divi sion on a satisfactory footing. This is with reference to my telegram No. 81. My telegram 88 was based on assumption that troops could and would be sent from Mesopotamia in case the security of Kermanshah-Enzeli road or political situation required it.

(Addressed London Foreign Office, 477 ; repeated Baghdad, Jassy and General Shore.) From all accounts I can gather it seems evident that the hesitation to commit themselves (two groups undecypherable) amongst elements we are trying to conciliate in the Caucasus and south of Russia arises from feeling of un certitude that they can count upon outside help and cf isolation. This feeling appears strongest among Cossacks of Baratoff’s command whose reluctance even to stop the many cases of pilaging by Maximalists soldiers shows their attitude. All Russian Intelligence opinion here agree that all that is required to bring them over heart and soul is the sight of British troops and I would urge strongly that it would be worth while making the experiment by sending as quickly as possible detachment from Mesopotamian Force. Operation will be necessary presumably at an early date so as to open road for armoured cars and officers destined for the Caucasus.

Should German and Austrian Officers who are reported to have been released from Baku, in General Shore’s telegram 17 2 to Director of Military Intelligence come to Tehran it would not take long before their friends got into power.

According to Rowlandson’s telegram 31, January 18th, Baratof counts on recruits from Caucasus to fill effectives of his reorganised forces. According to4 Offley Shore number of men likely to come forward for service in Persia is very small. Hence it would seem imprudent to count on Kussian effort to keep open road to Caucasus via Hamadan or to form cordon to stop German Agents. * Of his incapacity to do anything effective Baratof himself appears to be aware as he recently telegraphed to ask Bussian Officer Commanding Persian Cossacks to send a detachment to Kermanshah. In these circumstances I submit that His Majesty’s Government should consider whether measures must not be taken by ourselves. 123 Telegram P., No. 138-32-G., dated the 26th (received 27th) January 1918.

Their suggestion is that the two Governments should make the following proposals to Persian Govern ment :— (1) A proclamation guaranteeing Persia’s integrity and assuring her of an indemnity after the war for losses entailed upon her by enemy endeavours. J ( 2 ) Immediate advance of money for organisation of Persian troops to be placed under command of French and British officers and organisation of trade routes from south to north in order to secure passage of supplies and caravans. (3) An effective organisation for financial control under which head the Persian Government is already disposed to accept French assistance. (4) Loan without special security to enable Persian Government to maintain themselves in power. (5) This Anglo-French agreement would in no way alter existing agree ments between Great Britain and Russia which would be re established so soon as settled Government is set up in Russia. Your views on these proposals in general, and in particular whether French Legation exercises sufficient influence to render French co-operation of material help, should be telegraphed. \urt wU/vT 10 % Telegram V., No. X.-5547, dated the 26t i December 1917.

From— Colonel Orton, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Minister, Tehran; repeated General Staff Branch, and Sykes.) Clear the Line .—Continuation my 182-20-G., December 10th. Persian situation appears to demand a big comprehensive Military and political plan. The following steps, in conjunction with such Cossacks and, Russians as remain faithful to Allies, are suggested. Firstly .—600 South Persia Rifles troops from Deh advance into Ispahan, and within a month be reinforced by about 1,000 South Persia Rifles troops from Kerman Brigade plus squadron 15th Lancers.Secondly ,—By appointment of Bakhtiari Goyernor of Ispahan and with mono«■, the Bakhtiari he conciliated and won over entirely to our side, this step being the keystone of our policy. Thirdly. —Kermanshah to he occupied by British troops from Baghdad. Fourthly. —1,000 troops from Ispahan, plus Persian Cossacks plus Bakhtiari contingent, advance on Tehran, and occupy Capital, expelling all Turks, Austrians and Germans. This I believe to he feasible within 3 or 4 months and I also believe that in this way it would be practicable to control nearly all Persia. If enemy is allowed to control Tehran in the near future, our difficulties throughout Persia will be magnified and ultimately we will be forced to undertake disadvantageous operations. The Government of Persia is bankrupt, and our position in this country would be greatly strengthened by bold action and judicious employment of funds during next 3 months, if combined with open assurance to Persian people that British action intended for the maintenance and strengthening of tbe Persian nation and Persian independence. I consider we should grasp the situation boldly and comprehensively by the occupation of Tehran and not stop at the occupation of Ispahan jvhich would merely be a half measure. 20 Telegram P., No. 8-P., dated the 5th (received 6th) January 1918. Prom—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Felhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office.) Government of India’s telegram No. 8 -S. of January 3rd His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah, has been told that I am entirely in favour of his cultivating good relations with local democrats as far as possible. I informed His Majesty’s Consuls, Ispahan, Meshed, Shiraz and Tabriz, on January 3rd that it had been decided by His Majesty’s Government to agree that British officers in South Persia Rifles would be replaced by neutrals after the war and were also to consider 1907 Convention as scrapped. I enquired whether they could work up a pro-British and anti-German democrat party with these concessions to Persian sentiment. 21 Telegram P., No. 10-F., dated the 5th (received 6th) January 1918. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office.) It seems doubtful whether the French ^suggestion would have any great practical effect. While the individual suggestions are attractive enough, Ger man ophil Party would assert that we are using France as a Catspaw and that she is lending herself to our designs in so far as declaration constitutes a French guarantee of our engagements and of our good faith in particular as regards South Persia Rifles. This could be counteracted in some degree were guarantee of Persian independence and integrity to come from France alone.While financial proposals are attractive, promise of indemnity for losses from enemy endeavour is to be deprecated. Sum would be very large and amount difficult to establish. So far no such suggestion has yet occurred*to the Persians themselves and a very much smaller amount of cash down would be far more attractive than any distant prospect. If any such inducement is required, payment of British claims by oursehes would suffice. Promise of a loan is more useful, but it should be for a loan to be given in future. We should destroy our strongest weapon if we gave one now. We could promise to grant it on conditions to be arranged with French Financial experts whom Persian Government desire to engage, and we shall thus have opportunity of instituting some measure of supervision. Word “control” must be absolutely excluded; it is Anathema. As regards point 2 , proposal would be acceptable if presented in shape of an engagement to commence creation of uniform force under neutral officers ; there is a growing tendency here however to require that these officers shall be selected from a non-belligerent country. Eesponsible Persians have no wish to see South Persia Bifles and Cossack Division disappear and it is quite probable I think that a French Staff charged with amalgamation of these forces and gendarmerie would be well received. 4« Imperial Bank of Persia could not finance any large loan at present, and monthly advances and subsidies contemplated by His ^Majesty’s Govern ment seem sufficient, if coulped with prospective loan later in the circumstances above mentioned. . -Point 5 should be omitted altogether as we have already intimated privately our readiness to scrap 1807 Convention. Moderate people are fairly satisfied with our proffered terms but are afraid by accepting them to identify themselves with us out of fear of a German effort. . .It is not so much a further inducement that they require, as proof of our ability to protect them and ourselves. If we could count upon General Baratof’s new formations repeating coup of November 1915 situation here would be wholly changed. Very confidential .—I am unaware how His Majesty’s Government regard introduction of purely French influences in financial affairs of military questions. ^ I doubt whether French Legation would be of great assistance. In last 2. 1 years French Minister has kept very much in background and has twice excused himself to me and to Russian Minister from co-operating with us on the ground that he “ represented only a dozen professors now all on leave.” Nevertheless France’s influence is still high. This is with reference to your telegram No. 3 . 23 Telegram P., No. 179-20-G., dated the 5th (received 6th) January 1918. From—The Chief of the General Staff, South Persia Rifles, Sistan. To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed Minister, Tehran ; repeated Chief of the General Staff and Sykes, Delhi.) There are indications from several reliable sources that Soulet is endea vouring to undermine Qawam and create dissensions amongst Arab tribes. Recent attacks on our convoys between Tarum and Bandar Abbas may be attributed entirely to Soulet’s intrigues J Qawam who recently had trouble with his Arab Kalantars at Kharameh has now left there with his South Persia Rifles escort under Captain Butters I or -Uarab.wirl°wi]l Un , itS i D c Sh j r f ^ re makin g ra P id Progress and by next migrations mSil Sou et wko ’ wil1 be at our iriercy during sprin at KermaiTarr^ ?

From-The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—Tne Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- n ent, Delhi. (Addressed Tehran ; repeated Cox.) Viceroy’s telegram 1124-S., of November 21 st. There appears no special reason why local action to clear up situation in Bushire hinterland should be held to be inconsistent with general policy laid down in Foreign Office telegram No. 31320-Financial, dated November 16th, which refers to rebels as deserving condign punishment. Hitherto the obstacle has been the impossibility of^divert- ing requisite military force and diffidence of the Governor’s capacity to punish Khans even if provided with material by us. I discussed this matter at Delhi before proceeding here and suggested as a compromise the use of airships to terrify the Khans into surrendering to the Governor’s terms. I was given to, understand that the Government of India might consider possibility of provid ing 3 planes for a limited period and specific purpose if General Officer Com manding here concurred in practicability of their use. General Officer Com manding does so concur. Hence I see no practical difficulty in arriving at a settlement which w T ould at least save our face, eliminate Wassmuss and greatly assist Government in restoring order and collecting revenue thus reducing deficit on gulf ports administration. Nor would there be any particular diffi culty in maintaining a Persian Facade. I am of course unable to judge how such action would react on Tehran situation. If proposal is accepted by you in principle, I could eke out details of proposed line of action and suggest conditions to be imposed by Governor. Present moment appears suitable for such action as appropriate reply to hint involved in inclusion of Mukhber in Cabinet, Possibility of planes being received from India is conditional on continua tion of satisfactory conditions on North-West Frontier. * As this situation is generally doubtful in spring it would be advisable to take action as soon as possible if you approve suggestion. 25 Telegram P. ; No. 6, dated the 7th (received 8th) January 1918.

Proposal has my hearty support. I agree that it could be made clear that aeroplanes were used in support of Governor’s authority. TV hen Bushire was under General Officer Commanding of this force use of aeroplanes was consi dered but they could never be spared. If bombs can be used if necessary their employment in my opinion would not only very possibly provide us with a way out of the present impasse but the mere introduction of the aeroplanes and the knowledge that the Khans would never be safe henceforward from such reprisals would have a most salutary effect upon all m the Hinterland.

Formation of Cabinet has entrusted to Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek, Motamin-ul- Mulk called on me yesterday and submitted formulas of declarations I am tomake in name of His Majesty’s Government as soon as Mustanfi*ul-Mamalek assumes office. For text see my telegram No. 15. . Motamin-ul-Mulk said that if assured that such declaration would be made, a friendly Cabinet could in his opinion be formed at once under Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek or himself. I said that assurances would be required by me in return, ( 1 ) for official recognition of South Persia Hides, which was necessary as a public declaration to. kersia of Cabinet’s conviction of our good faith and friendship, and (2) that Persian Government would do all in its power to follow a policy of genuine benevolent neutrality and prevent German and other intrigues in Persia similar to those in 1915. He replied that he anticipated no difficulty a reply that would satisfy us being given. He also asked about money, and I said that he knew what we w r ere prepared to do, and that he could rest assured that with relations such as we wished His Majesty’s Government would do all that was needful These proposals though they are of course only private and are certainly not exhaustive, show an unexpected moderation and do not seem to me to go beyond limits of assurances already agreed to by His Majesty’s Government. If we can on similar moderate lines come to such terms as will bring in even a Mustaufi-ul-Mulk Cabinet it is I submit well worth while. Though Mustaufi-ul-Mulk and Motamin-ul-Mulk are not of course ideal, it will be a great step to have them on our side as leaders of moderate demo crats. I propose to work in this direction and I should be glad to have your very early instructions as to form of assurances I should ask in return. Good many of active leading democrats are coming forward to seek rela tions with us. This is with reference to my telegram No. 481. 34 Telegram P., No. 4, dated the 8th freceived 9th) January 1918.

From—Hia Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office, sent Cox.) Persian Government have handed me a note stating that French Red Cross officers are organising a military force at Urumia, that British officers will arrive later on and that British, French and United States Governments are to finance the force. They protest against proposal as a violation of Persia’s independence and neutrality. Acting Consul, Tabriz, has sent a further telegram explaining that the idea is to enrol Christian refugees from Turkey as well as local Volunteers and possibly Kurds, who being Persian subjects might render scheme palatable to Persian Government. Kurds are believed to realize that Turkey’s cause is hopeless, and it is probable that they would readily come under our control and might favourably influence their fellow-tribesmen across frontier. Identical protest has been received by French Minister who informs me that 100 horsemen have arrived in Urumia from Tabriz and that more are expected. He doubts the necessity of gendarmerie. The reply I propose to send is that matter is being referred to you, but that Christians of Urumia were in serious danger and that organization of gendarmerie is outcome of a general demand for protection which local authorities had been powerless to afford hitherto.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, To'—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Repeated to Tehran, Secretary of State and General Officer Commanding, Baghdad.) I am at KhaniMn with Kennion. He urges that in so far as proposed despatch of detachment into Persia he may he intended to support Bicharakow only they are not really needed in his opinion, and that if it is desired to afford him some overt support, object would he more effectively achieved if a flight of aeroplanes could visit Kermanshah and return. Landing place could be arranged. This course would also give time to have the road improved. At present it would be exceedingly difficult if not altogether impracticable. Prom political point of view he strongly deprecates entry of any British Force into Persia Until His Majesty’s Government’s policy had been finally decided upon. Minister’s last telegram indicated that he was in negotiation with moderate democrats. In Kennion’s telegram of December 29th (31st ?) repea ted by me, you were informed that local democrats were ready for rapproche ment with us, but made great point of our refraining from despatch of British troops into Persia. Despatch of detachment now before we have made any announcement of policy to them, would therefore be misunderstood and would greatly prejudice chance of our coming to understanding with them should that be desired. I may add in passing that if we arrive at understanding with the moderate demorcats, the Sinja^i tribe and Suliman Mirza, at present the Germans’ chief stand-by on this front, would come over in all probability. I do not know present whereabouts of German Minister or whether immediate despatch of troops is necessary in that connection. If not, I agree with Kennion that it would be better in the above circumstances for detach ment not to proceed beyond Kasri-Shirin for the present. If it is necessary to send them at this stage, Kennion thinks that cordon of Cavalry is insufficient as it would be necessary to hold Tak-i-Girreh Pass in strength from Sar-i-Pul to Karind in case of strong tribal opposition instigated by enemy and democrats. Should it be necessary to send troops, it is believed tribal and more especially democrat opposition would be considerably discounted if we could issue proclamation to tribes and local authorities assuring them that Great Britain had every intention of preserving thp integrity of Persia and that despatch of troops was a temporary measure with the object of preventing the intrusion of enemy parties into Persia undertaken with the concurrrence of the l ersian Government. 61 Telegram P., No. 10, dated (and received) the 12th January 1918.

In his telegram No. 2 o^T’ January 5th, Orton referred to his ability to “ finish off Soulet ” in Spring rather thanjiis intention of doing so. Soulet has, I believe, been stirring up trouble in Arab country, partly to get Kawam into disgrace and generally to foment disturbance; But I am strongly averse to any action against Soulet until he openly opposes us; this I do not think he will do. I hope it will be unnecessary to pay him any subvention this year. He was in a strong position last year with South Persia Rifles untrained, but the South Persia Rifles are now making rapid progress, while Soulet’s position even in his own tribe is very insecure. It is possible, however, that he might make a bid for popularity by declaring against us, in the event of serious disturbances elsewhere though not while we are being successful. Should necessity arise he would not be difficult to deal with especially so long as Kawam remains faithful to us.

Your telegram 20, January 7th. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul has been asked by me to ascertain whom Kermanshah democrats represent. I do not share view of Government of India that incident affords an opportunity of winning over democrats ; at any rate it would not win over extreme party whom nothing would satisfy than complete withdrawal of all our troops and officers from Persia, which would leave enemy free to carry out whatever designs he may have against India. On the other hand hostile feeling amongst more moderate democrats is due to a certain extent to misunderstanding. Lies spread in provinces by Tehran pressure may be counteracted to a certain extent and the volume and intensity of campaism may be checked by personal explanations to those honestly desirous of receiving them. This I am trying to do here and this is what I am inviting His Majesty’s Consul to do in provinces.66 Telegram R., No. 37-S., dated the 13th January 1918.

Grant, C.S.I., C.J.E., I.C.S., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. In continuation of my letter No. C.-42, dated the 23rd ultimo, I have the honour to report further regarding the recent departure from Herat of Wagner and certain other members of the German party. 2. As stated in my telegram No. 79-C.. dated the 1st instant to your address, the names of the three Austrians made over to the Bussians at Turshiz, who arrived at Meshed last week, are Jandl, Frantz, and Erause; and all are members of the original Niedermeyer mission. They have been examined by Lieutenant-Colonel Bedl, G S.O, and their statements, with the^ replies to certain supplementary questions put to them on the subject of their weapons, and other matters, form enclosures 1 and 2 to this report. 3 . A few points may be noted :— _ (1) Baverl, and not Wagner was killed, and the latter escaped m com pany with a Persian servant, Ghulam Biza. They are supposed to have proceeded via, Kashan and Kermanshah to Aleppo; but it would not be surprising to hear that they had changed their destination to Tehran. Their descriptions have been telegraphed to Tehran, Ispahan, Shiraz, and Kermanshah. (2) It seems that the Persian Governor of Turshiz and Zabi Khan had no hand in the escape of their prisoners beyond the negligence shewn in placing a guard only on the front of the house in which they were accommodated. They evidently did not suspect that the idea of breaking through the w all would occur to the captives, and the only probability of connivance which suggests itself is that the guard might have been bribed as the paitial demolition of the wall could scarcely have been conducted in perfect silence. (31 There are no discrepancies in the story of the escape and re-capture, which may be regarded as correct ; and the route taken by Warner is probably that given by the prisoners, as it is natural that°he should have instructed the guides to tell a false story on their return to Herat. (They said that he had gone to Meshed, vide paragraph 22 of my Diary No. ^ 8 .) The prisoners state that they brought no papers with them from- Herat, and that the one loaded mule which accom panied them carried cooking pots and personal eftects only. According: to the prisoners’ depositions all important doom ments were removed from Herat either by von Hentig or Niedirmeyer, both of whom quitted Afghanistan more than a vearao-o but we know that there are documents still at Herat, and efforts to secure these will not be abandoned. Wagner is him about 500 tumans m Persian and (4) believed to havn wdth English money. (51 The question of how the arms carried by the party ^ ^ of is still a little obscure, w tllink t ' iat approximately correct. were disposed that Jaudl’s story is / V ! i mujinrj( 6 ) The Governor of Turshiz was probably waiting for orders from Tehran regarding the disposal of the prisoners, which explains their long detention at Said-ud-din. The conduct of the Russian Agent is less reprehensible in the light of the prisoners’ state ments, as it is apparently he who was responsible for the presence of Zabi Khan and the Karasuran. 4. I have already referred to you and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran the question of the disposal of these prisoners : thei suggestion made by Colonel Guschin, the Russian Commandant, was entirely spontaneous, and testifies to the admirable spirit in which he invariably works with us in furtherance of what is still, at least so far as he is concerned, the common cause. I have again to acknowledge with gratitude and appreciation the work of Colonal Redl in connection with the matter under report. 5. A copy of ^ this letter and its enclosures will be submitted to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran for information. A.—Statement of Corporal Heinrich Jandl, 27th Austrian Infantry Regiment. {Taken over by Russian patrol at Said-ud-Din, November 1917.) I am a wireless telegraphist and was detached to Constantinople in 1914 for duty there. When Captain Medermeyer arrived in the spring of 1915 I was ordered to accompany him to Persia. The following party left for Aleppo ; Captain Niedermeyer, Lieutenant Voigt. Sergeant Jakob, Krause, Himitrivich and myself. At Aleppo we found Captain Wagner, von Hen tig, Hr. Becker, Hr. Niedermeyer, Valter, Rohrer, Kazim Beg, the Indian Rajah, Moulvi Barakatullah, and some 12 Indian non-commissioned officers and men. We all travelled together to Kermanshah where we met the brothers Paschen, Prince Reuss—the German Minister—and Count Logotheti, the Austrian Consul. There were also some others whose names I cannot recall. Most of these persons left for Tehran. We were some days at Kermanshah, after which the diplomatic officials and Niedermeyer proceeded direct to Tehran, and I accompanied Wagner and Paschen to Ispahan. There we found Pasting in charge of the wireless station, assisted by an Austrian whose name I do not recall. I joined them for the time. I was about 1 J months at Ispahan : I then proceeded to Tehran for a fortnight and on returning passed some 16 days at Ispahan before we left. Soon after I first reached Ispahan a party of some 25 escaped Austrian prisoners arrived there The first to leave Ispahan towards Afghanistan were Paschen and Wagner. With the second party were von Hentig, Rohrer, Kazim Beg, the Rajah, and Barakatullah. Both these parties proceeded to Tabas. The third party consisted of Hr. Becker with 3 Indian soldiers. With the 4th party were Jakob, Wedig—an attendant of Prince Reuss—Sergeant Bayerl, Krause, Himitrovich and Josef. The 5th party consisted of Niedermeyer, Voigt, Makhnik, Gregorovich, Paiung (Austrian soldiers) and myself. We overtook the 4th party at Anarak and joined them. Becker’s party we overtook at Chahardeh near Tabas. We proceeded together to Bushruyeh, but one stage before reaching that place Hr. Becker returned to Tabas. Before reaching Busbruyeh we joined von Hentig’s party. We remained 12 days at Bushruyeh, and while there heard of the attack on Wagner and Paschen’s party at Kain. These two officers abandoned their baggage and returned to Bushru^eh. We then together crossed the desert to Tun, but one stage short of that place turned off to Duhuk, and reached Afghanistan by the Yezdan road. At Herat we passed about 3 weeks, Paschen returning to Persia. The main party with Niedermeyer proceeded to Kabul, only Bayerl and Krause remaining at Herat. Sergeant Jakob died on the way to Kabul. There had been an intention of sending the wireless station from Ispahan on to Kabul, but it was never realised. We were some 8 months at Kabul. Our chiefs were carrying on negotiations with the Afghan Government. I am unable to say exactly what occurred, but it was said that Afghanistan was unfit for war,that the Amir and the principal officials were under English influence, and that there was no chance of success for us. Niedermeyer then asked for permission to depart. The first party to leave Kabul on the 21st June 1916 were Neidermeyer, von Hentig, Ttohrer, Gruden, Wagner, Dimitrovich, Erantz and myself. We left for Mazar-i-Sharif, but on the way Hentig and Hohrer (Reyer) left us for the Chinese frontier, taking Josef with them. One stage after leaving Balkh, Niedermeyer, with Abdul Wahab and a Turkoman guide procured by Abdul Wahab, also left us. His intention was to cross the Kara Kum desert, but I cannot say how far he penetrated into Russia. We sub sequently heard that he had passed Meshed in safety—I think at the end of July or early in August—and had proceeded to Tehran in Persian disguise in a post-waggon. „ Voigt and 2 Indians constituted the 2nd party. They met Bayerl and Krause * at Ghazni, and all returned together towards Kandahar. Bayerl and Krause reached Herat some days after us. Our long stay at Herat became un bearable to us as we had nothing to do. We received and sent on several occa sions letters by Persian or chance messengers. At last it was decided we should leave which we did on the 27th October of this year, making the pretext of a hunting expedition. We had a mounted Afghan escort, avoided all inhabited places and slept out in the open. We passed the Afghan frontier on the 30th October, exactly where I cannot say as we marched by by-ways. We passed the day of the 31st October at Khaf, leaving in the evening, and passed Turbat-i-Haidari, a few miles to the North of us, during the night of the lst-2nd November. We halted near a village before Turshiz, but passed Turshiz itself by night, and when making for the village of Kundur on the night of the 3rd-4ith November lost our way and reached a garden about mid-night where we bivouacked. The following morning we saw the Russian agent in the garden, recognizing him by the badge on his cap. Our guide told him that we were Turkomans (we had adopted Turkoman dress) and he sold us food and forage. Some hours later Wagner, who was outside the garden, fired 3 alarm shots. We seized our rifles and looked for the enemy. At that moment a fusilade began : Bayerl was killed by a shot in the head. At first we returned the fire but Wagner told us to cease firing and sent the guide to tell the Persians that we were not robbers. The Persians, however, continued to fire; the Persian Kaka was wounded and a horse was killed. At last they ceased firing and called to us to leave our arms in the garden and to come out, which we did. They refused to release us pending orders from the Governor of Turshiz, took us to Kundur for the night and the following day to Said-ud- Din where we were confined in a room. On the 6 th night after our arrival there we escaped by breaking through the wall, found our horses in the court yard (our saddles had been in the room with us), and escaped towards Tabas. On the 3rd day one horse broke down, and we observed Persians in pursuit. W r e sent Wagner off accompanied by Ghulam Raza who had a good brown horse, and ourselves scattered in. different directions to distract the pursuers. We 3 Austrians and the Persian Hussain were captured, but no more was seen of Wagner. He had a good grey Arab horse, 2 Mauser carbines, 2 ' pistols, and at least 500 tomans in Persian currency, English and Russian gold with him. We had had from 700 to 800 tomans including £50 sterling, besides 200 rubles in Russian gold. The Persians took 4 rifles and 120 tomans only from us. We had no papers with us nor did we leave any of importance at Herat. Niedermeyer took sketches of Afghanistan which he had made with him and von Hentig had other important documents. I think that Wagner will try to reach Aleppo by the line Kashan-Ker- manshah which was the route we originally intended to follow. He will avoid inhabited places as far as possible. He had obtained Persian clothes at Said- ud-Ein which he wore with a high felt kullah. Underneath he wore a grey coat and light brown trowsers. * Of the 4 Persians with us Abbas Ali remained sick between Khaf and Turbat-i-Haidari, Kaka wounded at Said-ud-I)in, Hussain was captured, and Ghulam Raza accompanied Wagner. * Certain discrepancies re Krause and Gruden may be noted.MMSSSH HMMi r \ m ] 3 '—Statement of Private Michael Krause of the 2 nd Honveg Infantry Regi ment. {Taken over by Russian patrol at Said-ud-Din, November 1917.) I am a field telegraphist and was detached to Constantinople in 1914. In the spring of 1915 I was ordered to accompany Captain Medermeyer, 0 together with Jandl, to Persia and Afghanistan, and remained with them the whole way to Kabul. When the German Mission left Kabul in 1916 I received orders to accompany Lieutenant Voigt and 2 Indians to Kandahar. We met Bayerl and Gruden at Ghszni, and they turned back with us. * After leaving Kandahar, and 2 stages before reaching Sabzwar, Voigt and the Indians turned off towards Persia. Bayerl, Gruden, and I with 12 haggage- mules proceeded to Herat where we found Captain Wagner, Jandl, Prantz, and Himitrovich. On the 27th October of this year by Wagner’s orders we left Herat for home. We were to make for Tabas, but I do not know the route intended after that. The party consisted of W~agner, Bayerl, Jandl, Prantz and myself. (Gruden started with us but returned to Herat from the Afghan frontier, and the head muleteer Abhas AH fell sick after leaving Khaf.) 3 Persians accompanied us all through— Ghulam Baza, Kaka and Hussain. 10 Afghan savars accompanied us as far as the Afghan frontier. We wore Turkoman dress with khaki underneath. We passed the day of the 30th October at Khaf, proceeded towards Turbat-i- Haidari, a few miles to the south of which we passed by night. We passed Turshiz by night (2nd-3rd November), spent the following day in the hills, and after losing our way to Kundur reached a garden, during the night of the 3rd-4th November, where we halted. It was in this garden, which belonged to the Bussian agent, that the fight occurred the next morning with Persian savars in which Bayerl was killed by my side, Kaka wounded, and a horse killed. We were taken to Kundur for the night by the Persians; thence the following day to Said-ud-Hin. We escaped the 6 th night of our confinement there. Kaka remained there. We made for Tabas, but on the 3rd day of our flight a horse broke down and we saw Per sians in pursuit. We scattered, and all except Wagner and Ghulam Baza were recaptured and taken to Said-ud-Din. Wagner had a good grey Arab. On the baggage mule were carried only cooking vessels and stores for the road. We had no papers with us and as far as I know not much money. Our arms were: 3 Bussian rifles, 1 French rifle, 2 Mauser carbines, 1 Mauser pistol and 1 para bellum pistol. The Persians took these arms as also 120 tomans in cash. The agent, I know, had the French rifle. I cannot say whether he sent for the Persian savars who captured us, but I think it probable. Bayerl had no gold wrist watch as the agent stated, and I do not think that even Wagner .had one. Bayerl’s was an ordinary nickel pocket watch. C.—Statement of Private Kdward Frantz of the 3rd Rattalion&gt; Fortress Artillery. {Taken over by Russian patrol at Said-ud-Din, November 1917.) I was detached to Constantinople in 1914 as cook to other men of my battalion and the following spring was detailed to accompany von Hentig to Aleppo and Tehran as his cook. We stayed at the German Consulate at Tehran going thence direct to Tabas without visiting Ispahan. Von Hentig had with him Kazim Beg, the Indian Bajah, Moulvi Barakatullah and some 12 Indian soldiers. We joined Niedermeyer before reaching Bushruyeh, and thence on travelled in company. W T e saw no Bussians between Bushruyeh and the Afghan frontier, but heard of the attack on Wagner and Paschen, and the loss of their baggage. We were 2 or 3 weeks at Herat before starting for Kabul. Bayerl, who was a telephonist, and Krause were left at Herat. I have no idea what occurred during the 8 months we spent at Kabul, as I was busied with my duties as cook. We left for Mazar-i-Sharif and soon after starting von Hentig left us. On proceeding further Niedermeyer also left us after we had passed Balkh. He proceeded towards Bussia. Of his subsequent movements I only know that he passed1 M through Meshed and eventually reached Tehran in a post waggon. Wagner and four of us Austrian soldiers finally arrived at Herat-Jandl, Dimitrovich, Gruden—an “ einjahriger ” of good education—and myself. Bayerl and Krause subsequently arrived as also Kazim Beg and Barakatullah. There was ^ nothing for us to do at Herat and Wagner ordered us to leave for Bersia. We knew, of course, that the journey would be risky. We marched for 3 days in Afghanistan and 5 in Persia, reaching at last a garden a few miles from Kundur where we passed the night. In the morning we saw the Russian agent, whom we recognized by the badge on his cap. One of our Persians talked with him and he warned us that there was danger from robbers in the neighbourhood, advised us to remain for the day in his garden, and sup plied us with provisions. After some hours there Wagner suddenly fired 3 alarm shots. We saw Persian savars near the garden, and were preparing for flight when we found that the garden was surrounded. The Persians opened fire on us to which we replied. Firing must have lasted for about an hour. Bayerl was killed by a shot in the head. We tried without success to convince the Persians that we were not robbers, but they continued firing and a Persian servant was wounded and a horse killed. When at last they ceased firing we laid down our arms in the garden and came out. Having taken possession of our baggage the Persians eventually took us to Said-ud-X)in where we remained several uays. To all our requests to be allowed to proceed they returned evasive answers, and seeing that the matter was hopeless we determined to escape. We broke the wall, found our horses, and leaving the wounded Persian behind, made for Tabas. Finding ourselves pursued on the 3rd day we scattered to give Captain Wagner a chance.^ All of us, except him and Ghulam Baza, were recaptured and returned to Said-ud'Din. Taken before me. Meshed ; 28th and 29th 'November 1917. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, General Staff Officer. Note. (Reference Intelligence Summary ho. 48)’: The statements that all the rifles with the German party were taken over by the Persians after the hgnt in the garden, and that Wagner, in his subsequent escape had 2 Mauser carbines and 2 pistols with him appear to require explanation. I therefore again queslioned the prisoners on the subject and their replies were as follows. (They were questioned separately.) (Af Jandl. —We escaped in the night. Late in the afternoon we noticed that the Persians in the adjoining room had all left it and were absent some time. We entered the room and found our 5 rifles, which with some cartridges, we were able to carry into our own room, and hide under cur effects The Persians did not notice the absence of the arms before the escape When we were recaptured the 3 Russian rifles were re-taken with us but Wagner had made off with the 2 Mausers. All our rifles had been taken from us after the fight in the garden. (h\ Frantz — All our rifles were taken from us in the garden, and we never got them back. Wagner had a Mauser pistol when he escaped which he had worn concealed under his clothes. (c) Krause .—The Persians took possession of all our rifles after the fight in the garden. On the afternoon of our escape we found 2 Mauser rifles in the room adjoining our own, and took them into our room. The Persians did not notice their absence and we took them with us. Asked how he accounted for the discrepancies in the above statements, Jandl said that when they escaped they found the baggage mule with their horses and took it with them. The 3 Russian rifles were loaded on the mule and it was possible that his companions did not notice this.•O'' All declared that they escaped without Persian connivance, and that no arrangement was entered into with Mir Zabi Khan to let Wagner go free, and to produce the Austrians as a proof of his zeal. They state that the wall was so thin that they were able to take out the bricks noiselessly without arousing the Persians who were sleeping in other parts of the building. There was a guard at the front of the building, but none at the stable side where they escaped. 2. With reference to the statement of the Russian agent that the European buried in his garden had a cross tattooed on his arm, Jandl was asked if any of the party had a cross tattooed on his person. He replied that none of them had but that Bayerl had very noticeable vaccination marks on the upper arm which were in the form of a cross. E. A. E.

Success of proposed mission from this force to Persia will depend mainly on concurrence and co-operation of a Tehran Government apparently to be rendered friendly by a change of policy on our part in accordance with aspirations of moderate democrats. What decision His Majesty’s Govern ment have come to in this regard I have not yet been informed. My last information is that contained in Foreign Office telegram to Tehran, No. 356 of December 20th and 365 of December 25th.

We should obviously know at the outset whether we are dealing with a friendly or a hostile P’ersian Government as question will necessarily affect plan of operations. The first step is to make good line from Khanikin to Kermanshah, and to achieve this the Sinjabi Chiefs and the democrat Sulaiman Mirza must be won over and unless a satisfactory assurance regard ing our future policy can he communicated to him there is little chance of this.

Colonel Khabaroff who commands Cossacks Brigade personally held enquiry into circumstances connected with death of Cossack and completely exculpated South Persia Rifles men.

Even if successful Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek’s painful efforts to form a Cabinet will at best produce a very feeble and timid combination that can only be of service to iis in that it will give us an opportunity to make a formal state ment of our friendly intentions and our readiness to come to terms on South Persia Rifles and other questions. In spite of my friendly warning it is more than likely Mukhbarus Sultaneh will occupy an important post in it, such as Minister of Finance. It is agreed in Political circles here that such a Cabinet cannot last, and there is a good deal of talk of attempts at a coup d*etat either by Germanophils or by revolutionaries or by those who look to us. (I have been twice invited to support such an attempt.) This talk in my opinion is simply as indication of the conviction that new blood is required amongst “ Ministrables.”15 77 Telegram P., No. X.-5939, dated the 16th (received 17th) January 1918.

Military action contemplated in various parts of Persia seems certainly to clash with our present endeavours to win over democrats .as suggested in opening of Cox’s telegram to Secretary of State 398, January Uth. But though this is of course inevitable to a certain extent, I do not think much harm will result ultimately so far as Tehran is concerned. In my endeavours to conciliate democrat opinion I have harped on the fact that our apparent unfriendly and aggressive action has been forced upon us in self-defence against enemy efforts, and I have said frankly that as Persia cannot help us, we may he obliged to take similar defensive action in future and shall not hesitate to do so. But in spite of this frankness I have succeeded to extent of breaking up democrat party, and there is now no inconsiderable section well disposed to us and ready to accept our assurances and support. It would be too much to hope that we can for a long time bring into being a really Anglophil Cabinet nor if we could would it be within its power to put an end to German activities but we may succeed in creating a body of public opinion strong enough to steady situation and act as a check on reckless party with which Germans work. In the long run we must rely on force the only thing as said in your telegram No. 365, to keep Persia straight. It is clearly politic to avoid as far as possible premature action calculated to shake the reviving confidence in the sincerity of our friendship or to give pretext for further attack. When the time comes, however, I am confident that force used unhesitatingly will have no ill consequences. It will restore the confidence of our friends and the general public will be little alarmed by appearance of our troops, e.g., at Hamadan or Kasvin or even Karej (Tabriz ?) and will indeed be relieved and grateful to us for putting an end to the uncertainty and apprehension nowfexist- ing, I would ftherefore recommend that while overt action should be avoided as much as circumstances permit preparations should be pushed on expedi tiously. 84 Telegram No. 4G-F., dated the 17th (received 18th) January 1918.

The following is a very brief appreciation of the situation that we are now trying to meet:— 1 . There is danger of a rupture of relations between Persia and ourselves being brought about by the return of German and Turkish representatives with* ll a crowd of agents and their success in working with reckless extremists. To guard against this we are endeavouring to win over such a body of public opinion amongst the moderate democrats in favour of good relations with us as will make that coup impossible. For this purpose His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give assurances calculated to reassure the ^ democrat leaders as to our friendliness, those assurances being connected with future of South Persia Rides, the 1907 Convention, the revision of the Customs tariff and the participation of Persia in the Peace Conference {vide, my tele gram 23). 2. Shah has no consistent attitude. He is in a state of abject fear, and is remitting his savings to Europe. The Cabinet which Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek is forming will contain no anti-democratic elements and will thus be well suited as means to proclaim the democrat party’s conversion to a belief in our sincerity. On the other hand it contains no one capable of dealing with the existing internal difficulties and will have to be strengthened. Our support is given in the form of the assurances abovementioned and of advances or subsidies possibly aggregating 200,000 tomans a month. In return the Persian Govern ment must recognise the South Persia Rifles in its present form till the end of war and pursue a friendly policy. 3. Foregoing should supply material for conversations with Mujfahids, etc. My suggestion is that in such conversations stress should be laid on the fact that since the beginning of war our actions in Persia which have been represent ed as indicating designs against (Persia ?) have been taken in self-defence against enemy efforts. Ho Cabinet will go far in the direction of active friendliness or hostility unless the pro-German extremists succeed in getting into office. The Persians though always ready to go with the side which shows strength are too timid to commit themselves deeply. It is unlikely that a dangerous situation will arise before the arrival of the enemy missions unless some move of enemy troops in this direction takes place.

(Repeated to the Secretary of State for India, London.) Kennion sends following telegrams :— Begins. No .-9 , dated 19th Janu- Kasr-i-Shirin. I met Suliman Mirza and Sinjabi Chiefs to-day. Speaking for democrat party Suliman Mirza said lie was ready to work with us provided we recognized Persia’s independence. He stipulated^ for freedom from foreign control and made special mention of South Persia Rifles, customs tariff and selection of Governors. I told him that I v as not competent to discuss such questions but suggested that he should accept my assurance of our desire to preserve Persia’s independence and leave frontier where his presence subjected him to suspicion and go to Tehran where he could work to secure better understanding with us on these controversial subjects. He replied that it would compromise his position with democrat party if he left without some assurances that British Legation would be open to discussion of such questions and he asked me to telegraph to Legation on jhe subject. If the Legation would then send for him through Minister of Interior, he would leave at once. This is how matter now stands. My conclusion is that Suliman Mirza has little hope from German connection and would drop it if we were prepared to meet democrats’^ wishes. Further steps would apparently depend on our general policy in Persia. Siniabi Chie r s declared that they had no connection with Germans and gave solemn assurances that they would protect road in future and allow no German or Turk to pass through their country and would give the enemy no cJL^£L*Jhjsupplies. They admitted Von DreufeTs visits, and they said his object was supplies which he did not get. Suliman Mirza is with Kasim Khan close to' Persian frontier, one mile north of road. Kasim Khan asks for permission to go to grazing grounds beyond Khanikin. Ali Akbar is at (Chah ?) Surkh and intends to follow tribe further west. Hussein Khan is near Kila Sabzi. Hence Sinjabi good inten tions are for the present assured. Suliman Mirza would like to meet Stokes at Kila Sabzi. Addressed Tehran ; repeated Cox and Khanikin. J^nds.

The condition of affairs in Tashkent where prisoners of war have recently been employed by the Maximalists to work in the Government tele graph offices and even to fight against the troops of the Provisional Govern ment, renders it likely that an increased number of escaped prisoners may now find their way into Persia, particularly into this province ; and the matter is receiving careful attention. 102 Telegram P., No. 20, dated (and received) |the 22nd January 1918.

I might not, however, be able to | protect bank, British firms and somewhat scattered British community while maintenance of general order would be out of the question.

It is stated by an informant who had himself joined Germans but has since abandoned their cause that Kanitz did not commit suicide in spring of last year but is still alive. The informant says that he accompanied him from Tehran where he spent a few days about a year ago disguised as a merchant under the name of Hassan Aga Amin Uttujar on a journey to Barfarush. He had then grown his beard. He was at Meshed when last heard of but informant could not discover him when he was there recently in Police service. Infor mant believes his real intention was to reach Central Asia, though he professed to wish to go to India An unsigned letter in French said to be written by him, dated Meshed, 4th September last year, has been shown me. I can say from my own knowledge that the handwriting certainly resembles Kanitz’s generally. In the letter he speaks of going to Sari and Askabad in the near future.

In the course of a long conversation yesterday Akbar Mirza impressed on me the necessity for our being prepared to bring South Persia Rifles to Ispahan. He urged that we should have a force at Abadeh ready even now sufficiently strong to enable us to despatch a force to Ispahan at onee. He fears that unless we can occupy Ispahan immediately on the others leaving the Rakhtians might occupy town in which case we should have the trouble of expelling them. His apprehensions are not shared to the full by myself hut his opinions are usually sound, and the Bakhtiaris would certainly do almost anything to * keep South Persia Rifles out. Akbar Mirza was told by one of them that the introduction of the South Persia Rifles must be opposed at all costs as it mi^ht permanently establish order which was the last thing that Bakhtiaris and &amp; he assumed Akbar wanted !

From—Hie Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, rp 0 The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Foreign Office, London.) I believe that unless Persia is to fall into anarchy it is impemtive to trin' about formation of a stronger Cabinet. Owing to internal difficulties, famine, very rapid extension of Jangali movement in Gilan (vide my telegram 3981) which is getting some support amongst Russian troops, increasing inde pendence of Tehran authority shown by the Provincials in North, and utter incapacity of Ain-ed-Dowleh’s Cabinet to deal with situation. Yopsuk-ed- Dowleh and Kavam Urumia Sultaneh wish to resign and if they persist Am- ed-Dowleh’s Cabinet will fall. Yossuk-ed-Dowleh is the reverse of anxious to form a Government as he foresees that His Majesty will not support hold policy he advocates so long as Shah’s incurable timidity leads him to follow pusillanimous advice of Mushir-ed-Dowleh and Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek. Vossuk- ed-Dowleh, however, will probably be asked to form a Cabinet and 1 should be glad therefore to have definite instructions as to support His Majesty’s Govern ment grant him. Secret. So contemptible a role is the Shah playing that his deposition is quietly discussed. In view of Russia’s example however, experiment is not likely to be tried.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Tehran, 231.) My Russian Colleague, a most gloomy follow, told me yesterday though he had heard nothing of' withdrawal of Russian troops and disbandment of Cossack Brigade everything pointed in direction of such measures being taken and that orders were no longer obeyed by Siberian Cossacks here who could not be trusted. I told Mm I had advocated establishment of a South Persia Rifles garrison here and he agreed with me as to necessity of this step. Except among Bakhtiaris and robbers the measure would be extraordi narily popular. This is with reference to my telegram 21. 75 Telegram P., No. 1171-S., dated the 8th December 1917.

From—The Chief of the General Staff, South Persia Rifles, Shiraz, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed Minister, repeated Chief of the General Staff and Sir P. Sykes, Delhi.) I have just returned from Abadeh and Aminabad, 500 South Persia Eifles partly Cavalry partly Infantry would reach Ispahan in case of urgency in a week from Abadeh, while 500 more could arrive from Shiraz or Kerman in a month. From a purely military point of view our military position would be weakened by South Persia Eifles garrison at Ispahan, the detachment would be at a distance and relations with additional tribes such as Bakhtiaris would be involved. To counteract this it would be necessary to operate more quickly, to buy more transport and have our indents on India for guns, rifles, ammuni tion and clothing expedited and supply questions, moreover, would be difficult owing to famine conditions in Ispahan. From a political point of view the difficulties of our anomalous position may be increased and a fresh anti-South Persia Eifles and anti-British outcry may be raised if the Persian Government continue their opposition towards the South Persia Eifles and should profess to regard a South Persia Eifles garrison at Ispahan as a further proof of British designs against Persia’s integrity. The Persian Government on the other hand may possibly welcome an indication of break up of the spheres of influence, and this fact might be urged in favour of regarding the South Persia Eifles as a Persian force guaranteeing law and order in Persia generally. In short, Ispahan could certainly be occupied by the South Persia Eifles to prevent anarchy and we could do this with equanimity if only Persian Government would openly favour the South Persian Eifles. In this crisis in Eussian affairs which vitally affects our whole military position in this country some clear declaration of British policy in Persia which would satisfy Persian Government would be of value.

My telegram No. 158 and your private letter of August 23rd. As it is necessary that orders should be maintained on the Bakhtiari road and it is quite impossible for us as proved by past and present experience to 'work in harmony with the whole tribal hierarchy, who will not pull together I submit that we should make our selection and slick to it, for variability in the past has made all the Khans uncertain of our attitude. lam convinced that Zaffar is the man to back and Akbar, with whom Noel and I discussed this matter at great length, agrees in this view, the grounds for which are as follows. Zaifar is now in oflS.ce and we should create a very bad impression were we to countenance another change ; he deserves better of us than any other Khan ; he enjoys the greatest prestige in Bakhtiari, he is on good terms with the Sheikh of Muhammerah ; he would find it very difficult to make his peace with the democrats; there is good reason to suppose that with our support he will be able to retain the Illkhaniship. The opposition of the Tehran Khans may be disagreeable but it is pro bably chiefly bluff, and if it is ignored and they find that Zaffar with our support can retain his position, as there is every reason to hope he will, they will probably arrive at a juster estimate of their importance, and climb down especially if a hint regarding their properties in Arabistan be thrown out. If we can follow out this policy it may be possible to effect a recon ciliation between Zaffar and Akbar. The latter is ready and Zaffar might be won over. To enable us to do this, to cement the friendship, and to remove a constant source of complaint and friction, I propose that we should lend Zaffar T 150,000 with which to purchase propeity of Yamin-es-Sultaneh in Burburud. The purchase would commit Zaffar more definitely to us and make it very difl&amp;cult for him to join Sam Sam. / Enclosure No. 7. Telegram No. 149, dated the 14th September 1917.

In view of the present situation in Russia Noel had changed his mind about going there, and having lost all his kit, was not thinking of going toTehran, but he can of course go if you think it necessary to discuss r ; matters with him. . V My reason for urging that Sirdar Zaffar should be supported is the absolute necessity for maintaining order on the Lynch road, which is at present the only route open for British merchandise in Western Persia, so that if it is closed, our trade is entirely suspended, and this at a time when Bussia is not in a position to export, and the game is entirely in our hands. I had great trouble here, when owing to the malignant activity of Mota' sham and Company, the road was closed to traffic, and was worried with daily complaints from merchants to whom I could give no satisfactory answer. The credit for reopening the road is entirely due^ to Zafar, but the effects of its closure are still felt as large quantities of^ merchandise still remain on the road, and owing to the scarcity of grain and fodder, can only be brought in by degrees. If owing to the lack of our support the determined effort to oust Zaffar which will almost certainly be made should succeed the troubles of our merchants will begin all over again. We shall have lost the friendship of Zaffar and I doubt whether we shall have gained the friendship of his opponents even if it be worth gaining. The Khans in Tehran may be making professions of friendship, but they have done nothing for us. I know that they have been sending telegrams through Persian officials prohibiting the Khans in Bakhtiari from raiding the property of Zill-es-Sultan and his family, but as these telegrams have produced no result whatever, it is obvious that the information which I. have received to the effect that they have been sending secret messages cancelling their telegra phic instructions, is correct. Enclosure No. 8(«). Telegram No. 164, dated the 16th September 1917. From—His Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. My immediately preceding telegram. . My reason for believing that the party at present m opposition will not work in our interests if we abandon Zaffar is a message given by them to Coffey of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and evidently intended for delivery to me, to the effect that Ispahan was the real bone of contention between us and that we need not expect them to help us until we gave the Governorship and expelled Zill-es-Sultan. Considering the terms of our promise to the latter this is of course impossible. Enclosure No. 9. Telegram No. 152, dated the 17th September 1917. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan. Your telegram 164. I am quite alive to the necessity of supporting the Illkhani for the time being in order to ensure the security of the road, but I am equally convinced that it would be bad policy to attempt to maintain an individual Illkhani against the rest, and that the attempt would defeat its own ends. Our support would have to be given in arms and repeated doles of money, and this would render individual himself the object of jealousy to his relations, who would combine to make the road unsafe as easiest way to prove his useless ness to us. It is true that we can do little with Khans here ; they used to look to us to protect the tribes against Russians, but now Bussia is washed out, advantages of our friendship have largely disappeared in their eyes, and they only want our money and will do little or nothing in return.I qmte agree that Zaffar is probably the most convinced friend we have among the tribe, but he is far from judicious. He will make big promises but m e could not tjarry them out, e.g., levies. It is inconceivable that when 1 lenran and half Persia are clamorous to circumvent South Persia Bifles, a clamour which would extend a welcome to the levies and be taken up by all his enemies and rivals in Bakhtiari and out, Zaffar would carry out such a scheme. Khans here would pronounce his deposition and if he resisted would fight. n lending him T-150,000 Bank will not lend on land security and we should have to find it for him with very little prospect of recovery. Akbar of course agrees with scheme as he would t-make a nice commission on it with his brother. I do not at all doubt that Tehran Khans secretly cancelled their orders against pillage of Zill-es-Sultan’s property. They are Bakhtiaris. . I do not want to see Captain Noel except to impress on him that our policy is not to raise questions in Bakhtiari, but to avoid them and that he must not start his wild cat schemes and particularly not broach them to the Khans without first consulting me. Please show this to him. Enclosure No. 10. Telegram No. 167, dated the lyth September 1917. Prom—Pis Majesty’s Consul-General Ispahan, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Your telegram No. 152. Paragraph 1.—The necessity for supporting the actual Illkhani being admitted I submit that there is no ground for withdrawing our support from Zaffar who does not stand alone, but with Ashja, Sardar Patih and probably Amir Jang. Paragraph 5.—-Arms have not yet been asked for but the loan of two guns wherewith to deal with the Kuhgelus has been approved by the military authori ties and can be arranged. This is much less assistance than was suggested for Sardar-i-Jang early in 1914. Prom fifty to seventy-five thousand°tumans is a small sum for securing the safety of 'the Bakhtiari road considering what we are spending elsewhere vitha similar object. The Khans combined against Sardar Jang a few years ago and attempted to disturb the road, but with our help he overcame this opposition. The same policy was pursued by the opposi tion this year and Zaffar has temporarily overcome it without our help, and with our support against Kuhgelus, might remove the principal source of danger. If his resentment of our lack of support should turn him against us the disorders of last spring will be repeated in an aggravated form. Paragraph 3 .—It appears that the friendship of the Khans in Tehran is hardly worth cultivating and in the absence of Russian support our only means of controlling Bakhtiaris seems to be to support one party against the other. If we decline to support either both may combine against us and we shall lose our hold on the Bakhtiaris. Paragraph 4 .—Zaffar is, of course, not perfect, but in view of the necessity for supporting somebody it appears to me that we should support him. The levy question perhaps hardly comes into the sphere of practical politics at present and in my opinion should not be raised until the Kuhgelus have been ,f dealt with—if then. Should it be found possible to bring it forward Zaffar seems to me to stand as good a chance of succeeding as anybody else. Paragraph 5 .—There is other security besides land for a loan to Zaffar, viz., the so-called protection subsidy of £2,400 a year as well as the oil shares of his party and Dizful property which might not be acceptable to the I. B. P., but is in our power and would be a good security for a Government loan. Tl^is scheme is mine and not Akbar’s, and I am convinced that he is not out after a few thousand tumans as commission. He names a much smaller sum than I expected and will probably have some difficulty in getting Yamin to accept it. Even if he is after commission, we can easily defeat his objectby handing the money direct to Yamin. It would take a cleverer man than Akbar to force Yamin to disgorge even if he had agreed to. Akbar as you know though not above intrigues for his own ends is not a money grubber. My object in proposing this scheme is to extricate His Majesty’s Government, you and myself from a very embarrassing position. The Zillis frequently remind me of the written promise of His Majesty’s Government which covers their property and ask for help against those who plunder their villages. I cannot deny our responsibility and can only reply that we cannot at present meet our engagements. The scheme has not, of course, been mentioned to Zaffar and I do not think that any wild cat schemes have been either raised or discussed. The question of w T hom we are to support must, I think, be considered, the Kuhgelu scheme is three years and the levy scheme a year old, but as I said this last need not be discussed at present. If Zaffar as Ill-khani is not to be helped I should be grateful for instruction as to the course to be followed. Muhtasham and Murteza Quli are bitterly hostile, Mujahid is out of the question and from your telegram it appears that v the Tehran Khans have not earned our support and are not likely to do so.

Bakhtiaris have recently been illegally collecting taxes in Earaidun espe cially from property of Zill-es-Sultan’s family and that of Armenians. In response to a protest from me, Zaffar has recalled his sons and all over whom his influence extends, but other Khans remain there and are continuing to harry the villagers He has protested to the Khans in Tehran and has written to me to say that in the face of the intrigues of the opposition, and their open interference in the Government he fears he will be obliged to resign unless he receives our support. Your telegram, w T hich he had not received when he wrote, may help him, but I fear that without the measure of support which I have already indicated the opposition will succeed in turning out one tvho is e known to be our nominee, and we shall lose all control over the Bakhtiari coun try and the Lynch road, and the existing complications between the Government of Ispahan and the Khan will become greatly aggravated.

I have received your telegram and am very grateful for your expressions of satisfaction with my work in establishing order in Bakhtiari and on the Lynch road. You must know with what difficulties I had to contend when I ' first undertook the duties of Illkhani, how the opposition had thrown every thing into disorder. After I became Illkhani I sent my son with a consider able force of sowars and foot to guard the road. Lynch can inform you in what good order the road now is and how for three months I have expended all £ the receipts on road guards and have frustrated all the attempts of my enemies r to make the road unsafe. Eor various reasons I can now no longer carry on but c if necessary I can repeat the list of my difficulties and needs. I am now as ever &lt; ready to work for your interests in all matters, whether in the Bakhtiari country or beyond its limits. If I am left unsupported as during the last, four monthsQ my prestige will disappear and l am sure that you would not wish that I after all my services to the British Government that I should in my old age he accoun ted an unprofitable servant.

Ido not regard Zaffar as our nominee but as Noel’s. I neter thought the selection a good one and was confident that Zaffar could not last long and it seems that I was right.

I know that it was Noel who first suggested that Zaffar would probably be the next Illkhani, but he has every right to regard himself as your nominee. See your telegram to Noel, No. 20 of April 17th. Zaffar will of course not last long without our promised support. Mohtosham fell for want of it in connecto^n with the Kuhgelu business and would have fallen sooner had we not given him as much support as we did. Jang only fell after he had forfeited our confidence by his disgraceful support of the Jahad movement in Arabistan and we had in consequene withdrawn our support. No Khan can stand long as Illkhani friendly to us unless he has our support. There is nothing abnormal in intrigues against Illkhani, but the question is one whether we shall withhold our support from one who has shown friendship for us in order to leave the field open for those whom we know to be our enemies. Enclosure No 15. Telegram No. 162, dated the 26th September 1917. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan. Your telegram No. 167. 1 have no desire to withdraw ‘ support from Zaffar. There have clearly been misunderstanding of recent telegrams. I took your 159-A indi cating a recommendation to support Zaffar if not permanently at all events for a period considerably longer than usual tenure of office by Ill khani. It was this suggestion of which my telegram No.| 152 was intended to express disavowal. Paragraph 5.—Loan of guns was approved in special circumstances which seem to me to be no longer existing. Opposition against Jang was much less formidable than that which threatens Zaffar, as four of the principal Khans were absent in the provinces where we had got them Goyernorships. Even so Jang had to resign eventually, so that much greater effort will have to be made to retain Zafar. /Paragraph 5 .—I presume that oy protective subsidy you mean the guarding subsidy paid by Oil Company. This does not belong to Zaffar person ally and is no security. As for oil shares Khans have again raised money on them. I do not think His Majesty’s Government would loan money on Dizful property. I do not at all agree with you as to Akbar’s disinterested ness. I have experience of it. I have not seen last letter from His Majesty’s Government to Zill-es-Sultan, but I feel pretty confident protection contem plated was only against confiscation by Persian Government. Can you get copy of letter for me. If it were otherwise why did Zill-es-Sultan engage another Kussian as agent for his property. Enclosure No. 16. Telegram No. 177, dated the 28th September 1917. From—His Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. Your telegram 162. I am much relieved by your promise of continuance of support to Zaffar, and with your approval propose to visit him and repeat it to him personally, I have never mentioned any term in connection with our support of Zaffar, but it is quite true that I consider we cannot with decency abandon him after three months of good service. For the present I think he should be supported daring good behaviour but if after a decent interval we find the opposition too strong for us we shall be able, without incurring the charge of fickleness, to suggest that Zaffar has had a good innings and should give way to another. At present, however, we can hardly abandon him without losing prestige and neither you, nor Noel, or I have any interest in frequent changes in the Tllkhaniship which lay us open to the charge of inconstancy. Paragraph 2 .—I do not know how circumstances have changed. Kuhgelus are the chief troublers of the Bakhtiari road and the importance of keeping that road open is as urgent as ever it was. It is equally important permanently to deprive the opposition of a dangerous weapon, which they have recently used with considerable effect and which will always be ready at their hands till the Kuhgelus are crushed. I believe that our military position in the South and the presence of Russian troops in Ispahan are a fair substitute for the position creaTedTy'our provision of four Governments for the Khans in Jang’s time. As for Jang’s resignation please see my telegram 176. He fell because we’ withdrew our support. Paragraph 5. —Yes, I meant this subsidy which we can retain as long as Z is Illkhani but which I never regarded as more than subsidiary security. I did not know that the Khans in Tehran had been raising money on the shares of Zaffar’s party as well as their own. I do]not know why His Majesty’s Government should not lend on such good and accessible security as the Dizful property, but if they will not, we might try the Government of India as I have already suggested. With regard to Akbar my personal intercourse with him in this transac tion enabled me to form a correct opinion of his attitude. You yourself told me that he was not sordid though of course we all know that he will intrigue for what he considers worth having, the Government of Fars. Had he now been out for money he would certainly have demanded half the value of Yamin’s estates.

He will o-et same assistance from us as any other Illkhani whose appointment we have brought about or accepted, but I will not embark on a policy of such permanent support to him or any other Khan, such as I understand you to advocate, as would amount to imposing him on the tribe, unless very much wider interests than those which exist at present require exceptional measures. o do so only antagonizes the other Khans whom we have to make use of sooner or later as in the case of Ashjaa to-day. Enclosure No. 18, Telegram No. 180, dated the 29th September 1917. From His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Your telegram 162. Following is important passage in letter dated May 10th, 1916, from Sir Edward Grey to Zill-es-Sultan. J “ I have the honour to assure Your Imperial Highness that if your life bd m danger, or if anything is done against your honour, His Majestv’s Govern ment are prepared in conjunction with the Russian Government, and' as long as you continue to net in a loyal manner towards His Imperial Majesty the Shah, to extend to you, your family and your property every protection 'which they may be in a position to afford.” :.w There is, as you will see, no limitation of the protection to be afforded, and I fear that if we attempt to read into the letter anything that is not there we shall damage the credit of His Majesty’s Government. We are not the only protectors of the Zill-es-Sultan who holds a letter in identical terms from the Russian Government and as he is indebted to Ihem as much as to His Majesty’s Government and his property is situated in the Russian sphere of influence, I think that he w r as right in believing that he was following the correct course in employing a Russian agronome. I understood this to be your view when you forbade me to remind him of his promise to employ an Englishman. If we refuse to protect Zill-es-Sultan he may apply to the Russians whom I believe to be ready to help him and we shall then have direct Russian inter ference in Bakhtiari. to ^ laM Enclosure No. 19. Telegram No. 181, dated the 30th September 1917. From—His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, ^ To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Bakhtiari aggression against the estates of the Zill-es-Sultan’s family is increasing and unless we take early steps to form a party of our own in Bakhtiari the movement may develop into open and general plunder of these estates and we shall find it impossible to fulfil His Majesty’s Government’s engagement to the Zill-es-Sultan. Enclosure No. 20. Telegram No. 182, dated the 1st October 1917. yi From—His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Your telegram No. 164. Perhaps Zaffar is not particularly bright, but I cannot possibly tell him that he is dense because believed a definite promise. I believe that causes mentioned by me would have been quite sufficient of themselves to cause downfall of Jang and Mohtasham.Zaffar has as yet had no support except a promise of which he awaits the fulfilment, and I do not advocate permanent support for him, but merely such a measure of it as will enable him to keep his place as Illkhani, and maintain order for a reasonable period, for these annual changes in the Government of the Bakhtiari are bewildering to us, and do not make for the maintenance of order. Antagonism of the other Khans will matter less when we have clipped their claws by suppressing Kuhgelus,—a necessary measure which should strengthen us not only against our present enemies, but also against any Khan, including Zaffar himself, who may turn against us in the future. I do not believe that the Tehran Khans deserve such consideration as should be shown to friends. (See Scott’s telegram JNo. 123.) I have plenty of evidence from Bakhtiari that they are not our friends, whatever they may have said to Churchill or he to them, and that their enmity to us is due to causes other than our support of Zaffar. They have no cause of enmity against him except that he is our friend, and if we fail to strengthen his hand against them, both he and they will understand that our friendship is not worth much, and it is quite possible that he may forsake us for them. I believe there is very little fear of a permanent estrangement between us and any of the Khans,for a Bakhtiari will always come back to us whenever we have anything to offer. A permanent estrangement could only be caused by the belief that we have nothing worth having to offer. A loan to enable Zaffar to buy Yamin’s estates is I admit an exceptional measure, but I believe that 'we should be able to recover the money, and the loan will enable us to settle a business in which, as it appears to me, the honour of His Majesty’s Government is involved. The interests involved are the security of British trade on the only route open to it and the fulfilment of an engagement entered into by His Majesty’s Government. Enclosure No. 21. Telegram No. 165, dated the 1st October 1917. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan. Your telegram No. 180. In spite of very wide wording of letter I am still convinced that His Majesty’s Government never intended to guarantee protection, except in case of action by Shah or Government and I am equally sure Zill-es-Sultan understood this at the time. However, I am referring to Foreign Office for their interpreta tion. It seems to me most unlikely that Bussians could interfere actively even if they wished to do so, nor do I see that we could object seriously as long as their operations are confined to Russian sphere and that their forces do not enter Bakhtiaii territory which they were forbidden to do a year ago. Enclosure No. 22. Telegram No. 167, dated the 3rd October 1917. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan. Your telegram 177, paragraph 5. I do not quite know what you mean by shares of Zaffar’s party, but when at Kerman he raised T. 20,000 from I. B. P. on his interest in the shares held by the tribe, those shares stand in the name Sam Sam^ Assad (now Bahadur) Jang and Mohtasham, and the first three named have just raised T. 10,000 each on them. A further T. 9,000 for which these shares served as security for a former advance still remains unpaid, Zaffar has thus little security to offer on this score.To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Q Your telegram 167. Oil shares were suggested merely as subsidiary security, but the matter appears to stand thus. There is a debt of T. 59,000 in all against the shares, interest on which last year, when heavy losses were suffered by the Company was £3,000. Total value of shares as security may therefore be taken as £60,000 and we may legitimately expect that when time comes for recovery pound will be worth four tomans. Eeal security is however Dizful property to which we may add the hold we shall have over Zaffar. Political Officer at Dizful has just telegraphed that advanced guard of tribe is appearing in Arabistan and asks Noel to address Zaffar with a view to his making special arrangements to keep them in hand. You will doubtless remember the friction caused last year owing to our military position in Shuster^ and Dizful. It is highly desirable that Zaffar,the one Khan who has accepted this position without reservOj should be strongly supported. Your telegram No. 152, paragraph 4. • Levy scheme has been dropped for the present, but with regard to the general question whether any support that we may give to Zaffar will defeat its own ends by so antagonizing the Khans that they will fight, I think that we may assume that they will not fight in any circumstances. They caved in last January when we insisted on retaining Mohta sham against their will, and you threatened them with the confiscation of their oil shares, and again when they realized that they had lost Shuster and Dizful which was perhaps a heavier blow than the loss of Ispahan.

So far as I can gather your reasons for your exceptional support of Zaffar are— (1) Security of Ahwaz road as being the only one open. You must be^ aware that Bushire roads are working as well as formerly and that there is considerable traffic via Khoremabad to say nothing of Bandar Abbas and record imports via Nushki. (2) That our credit is engaged^ apparently on the strength of a promise of support I made when Noel “rushed” me into backing Zaffar’s candidature. That promise was, however, very largely discounted by message I instructed Noel to give to Zaffar. I gave him no other until some time after he took office. If in spite of Noel’s knowledge of my views on Zaffar’s appointment he still made promises (and he has not reported having done so to me) I decline to be bound by them. In any case I am supporting Zaffar to the same extent as I should any other friendly Illkhani and I cannot yet see any valid grounds for giving him the additional support you advocate.

Colonel Haig took up cudgels on my behalf in support of Zaffar and for last month has been intelegraphic communication with Minister (copies posted to you). Minister s hows signs of weakening but as telegraphic correspondence threatens to drag oh interminably and he has expressed desire to discuss question personally with me I am leaving for Tehran and have suggested to Edmonds that he should meet me at Kum October 11th.

You doubtless received the intimation from His Majesty’s Government on or about September 3rd regarding Turko-German aspirations during coming winter. Some details were clearly fantastic and were not regarded seriously here. At the same time having regard to the poor figure which Eussian forces are cutting in Persia, and to the dubious character of the present Persian Government we obviously need to be prepared for possible com plications. As far as I can judge from this side it is of the highest importance that we should lose no time in rallying such friendly elements as we can hope to command, firstly among Nurds, secondly in Pusht-i-Kuh and thirdly in Bakhtiari country. As regards first two we must do what we can from here. It is in regard to the Bakhtiaris that I now venture to offer some observations, especially as I learn that Noel is proceeding to Tehran. Zugmeyer’s diary has recently proved Sardar Zaffar to have been a better friend than we thought, and at this juncture the most if not the only element whose adherence we can at all count upon in emergency. If you are agreed upon this point it follows that Sardar Zaffar is the man for us to encourage and I much hope that after discussion of details of situation with Noel you will be able to send Noel back with your strong and overt support. If he has that support his local knowledge and excellent personal reputa tion in Arabistan and Bakhtiari country will make him a most valuable asset at the present time and one which w r e cannot afford to lose. On the other hand without your confidence and backing his powers will be in a great measure sterilised. Enclosure No. 27. Telegram P., No. Ill, dated the 12th (received 13th) October 1917.

I have not had telegrams of early September to which you allude in your 4189, but I have had a telegram from Government of India showing that these plans are taken seriously in India. I must however confess like yourself to a good deal of scepticism. London has however invited my views on Viceroy’s telegram 14121 of September 19th, to Secretary of State for India which recom mends mobilizing all our possible friendly interests in Persia, i.e., by obtaining present recognition of enfranchisement-etRifles : by our agreeing to the Persian suggestion for scheme of a uniform force for all Persia : by subsidizing various tribes, tribal chieftains and other personages and by strengthening our intelli gence service in western Persia.

(1) because of criticism from the other Khans, and (2) because the two junior Khans in charge of road at Dehdiz are both violently anti-Russian. There is also an element of danger for with the best Mamurs I fear Cossacks will have a hostile reception from tribes now moving south who all know of Khans feeling and I doubt whether it would be to our interests to cause unnecessary irritation at present if it can be possibly avoided Knowing how this would be viewed by Khans and tribes I feel that any ^arrangement I may make would be prejudicial to my personal relations with 'them and altogether it is a responsibility which I am disinclined to take unless specially requested by you to do so.

(Addressed His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tel ran, repeated Chief of the General Staff and General Sykes, Delhi.) Continuation my 182-19-G. of 8th. A South Forsia BHIgs garrison at Ispahan would, in my opinion, raise large issues, and the Persian Government and democratic party, aided by Turkish and German Agents would endeavour to excite a bastard patriotism against South Persia Itifles and against British. If this occupation is forced upon South Persia Bifles by circumstances, it would he well to consider beforehand political measures, which should harmo nise with our military position in Ispahan. The main political facts which might influence possible military action at Ispahan, and my own views on them are as follows :— In Ispahan the democratic influence is very great and is Anti-British. Zill-es-Sultan’s party, is not strong and is un (popular ?) locally. Bakhtiari power is the strongest local factor and their ambition aims at the extinction of Zill-es-Sultan’s party and the control of Ispahan Town and Province. I am of opinion that if South Persia Bifles occupy Ispahan we should plump for Bakhtiari co-operation and the raising of a Bakhtiari South Persia Bifles Cavalry Begiment The idea of Bakhtiari Governorship of Ispahan would of course not be entertained. Persian Cossacks in Ispahan would willingly join South Persia Bifles and these should be taken over* Co-operation of Bakhtiaris would so strengthen our power that we could afford to disregard other local Anti-British factors. Consul, Shiraz, agrees generally with above. 83 « Telegram P., No 437-F., dated (and received) the 12th December 1917.

Shortly afterwards the Illkhani resigned and the matter remained in abeyance. In connection with our political relations with the Bakhtiaris and the decision that we should support friendly (Khans ?) His Majesty’s Minister acting on the recommendations of His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, and Captain Noel recently asked that 300 rifles and 60,000 rounds should be despatch ed to the present Illkhani Sardar Zaffar on whom we depend for keepino 1 the Ahwaz-Ispahan road open and for opposing any possible Turco-German incursion. He wired “ It would be politic in my opinion to let Sardar Zaffar have the rifles and I hope the General Officer Commanding will consent to give them. I regard him as the sincerest of all the Khans in his friendliness for us and I believe that he would do his best to intercept German agents and keep road open.” This was laid before General Officer Commanding in Chief with full explanations and an expression of the hope that he would withdraw his objections. He, however, replies that “ Since he has been in command he has consistently maintained the principle that arms should not be distributed to sundry tribes and he is not prepared to depart from that principle in the present instance. As he is responsible for maintaining area in question in a tranquil state, it would, in his opinion, be most unwise to distribute arms to individuals who as is well known may be with us to-day and against us to-morrow.” I do not_ feel justified in accepting this disposal of the matter without reference to His Majesty’s Government as the question also affects political situation within the Minister’s sphere and outside that of this force. I there fore request that they will issue such orders as they may deem necessary. 30 Telegram P., No. 394i-F., dated the 20th (received 21st) November 3917.

From— Zair Khidar Tangistani, Amir-i-Islam, Zabit of Tangistan, Abram, To—All the people of Halileh (a village on Bushire Island 3 miles from the Subzabad Residency). (In Zair Khidar’s own handwriting.) I have received the answer which you sent to my letter. You wrote that you were poor. The people of Bariki in Tangistan, whom the Darya Begi has oppressed, fined without any right and made to pay money, are much poorer than you. By what right, on what account and for what fault does he take money from the subjects of Tangistan, and seize their boats ? I write to in form you that immediately on the receipt of this letter you should either bring me the money, which His Excellency Darya Begi took from the subjects of Tangistan (and I will produce in the Court of Justice at Bushire any person from our villages of Bariki who may have done anything wrong) or, if the Darya Begi does not refund the money you must yourselves bring me 500 tomans. You should not think that the ten Tufangchis at Halileh can protect you. Whether there are any Tufangchis or not, I will not do anything to the village or hurt innocent children. I give you a respite of ten days. If you bring me 500 tomans, well and good ; but if you procrastinate doing so, I will send men to cut 10-20 of your palm trees. I will then wait for another 10 days. If you do not comply with what I have told you to do, I will send men to cut 100 of your palm trees and destroy 4 or 5 of your wells. I will again wait for 10 days. If you still refuse to do what I have said, and do not send me the money from the Darya Begi nor from yourselves, I will send men to destroy all your palm trees and wells. I will then obtain my money from the people of Beshire. In these days we (i.e., the rebels) hope to be able to put other districts in order, not that the Darya Begi should snatch our hats off our own heads {i.e. 3 levy money from us). You should bring me 500 tomans. If you fail to do this, all your date trees and crops, except the village and your children, will be destroyed.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, “The Secretary to the Government of India ia the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. (Addressed London ; repeated Simla.) The follow ing observations are submitted on your telegram No. 320 :— 1. I concur generally. 2. Danger to be apprehended from such roving bands is in my opinion that they might make use of various local disintegrating forces such as the dis affected tribes in the west and north-west or the Jangalis of Gilan who are virtually masters of Resht and some 50 miles of the Kazvin road. If allowed to gather head, the combination of such forces might threaten existing regime in Tehran with the help of the local revolutionary element as the Tehran situa tion is none too stable owing to the general discontent with the Shah which is aggravated by the threat of famine. If the Russian troops are not to be relied on armoured cars would guarantee us against any such danger. At present it would be useless to suggest putting them at disposal of °Persian Government.^ They could, however, be sent in the first instance nominally to support Russian troops. If the Russian troops prove untrustworthy and were withdrawn, Persian Government could do nothing to oppose Turkish or German military action. They might, however, take action against a subversive movement such as suggested above and we could then offer them assistance of cars to support the Persian Cossack division the only organized force they possess except for 2,000 gendarmes under 3 Swedish officers. As the Russian troops are of such very doubtful value would it not be prudent to_ employ part of the large sum now paid to Baratoff to finance Cossack Division which now depends on remittance of rouble notes from Petrograd which have to be sold here at market rates.3. Concessions to Persian sentiment, e.g., the appointment of a Persian officer to a high post in the South Persia Rifles, are not precluded presumably. It will be difficult to find satisfactory non-committal answer to the sug gestion for neutral officers for single uniform force which the Persian Govern ment are sure to renew. As regards inducements, suggestions under A and B are in my opinion sufficient and I should propose beginning to negotiate with an offer of 50,000 tomans as subsidy. To avoid confusion I would urge that the monthly instalments of the moratorium be made on a sterling basis, the Persian Government’s account being debited with such sum in sterling as will provide 100,000 tomans. Similarly our half of arrears would amount to tomans 50,000 monthly. No mention is made in your telegram regarding mixed financial commis sion. This question has been very much exploited by the democrats of late, and it may prove serious obstacle to formation of friendly Cabinet. Is it the intention of His Majesty’s Government not to recede from position indicated in your telegram 287 ? A concession would facilitate matters, but I can think of none that would not sacrifice the points of principle. On question of Shiraz- Bushire road I presume subventions to Kavam and Soulet are not precluded by your decision. I think it necessary to renew our subventions to them as they have secured fair security to trade,—vitally necessary to enable the Imperial Bank of Persia to continue to finance us. There is a factor in the situation which I do not think I have yet men tioned but which has existed since the Russian debacle, viz., a disposition on the part of the Persian Government and Persians generally to speculate on the effect on Persia of the conclusion of a separate peace by Russians. So strongly is probability of this eventuality entertained that I have good reason to believe that Persian Government or some ot its members are trying to send a special delegate to Constantinople, w ith what particular object I have not yet discovered. I am inclined to think, however, that their aim is not hostility to us but self preservation. Subject to such modification as you think necessary I think it possible to secure advent to power of a reasonably friendly Cabinet, and this policy seems a sound one to pursue. So long as issues of war especially in eastern theatre remain uncertain in Persian eyes no Cabinet will decide to connive at coming; off the fence. 46 Telegram it., No. 5342, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) November 1917.

Cabinet has been formed by Ain-ed-Dowleh with Yossuk-ed-Dowleh as Minister of Education, Amir-ul-Mulk, Minister of Posts, Mushar-ul-Mulk, Minister of Finance, and Mukhbar-es-Sultaneh, Minister of Justice, the other portfolios being unchanged. Yossuk-ed-Dowleh only consented to join under strong sentimental pressure from the Shah. Mukhbar-es-Sultaneh’s inclusion will no doubt be justified to us as a set off against Yossuk-ed-Dowleh, but it is none the less an affront. This extraordinary combination implies no change of policy, it is mainly outcome of Shah’s aversion to any abrupt transition and partly also the general desire to sit on fence. It is only paving way to a Vossuk-ed-Dowleh s Cabinet in immediate future. This is with reference to my telegram No. 394.4 51 Telegram P., No. 76-C., dated (and received) the 25th November 1917.

I I have been of opinion that rigorous measures should be taken and that force should be used, so that whatever is God’s will should come to pass. My friends and yours (L/?., the British) did not approve and agree. You will have made enquiries there at Bushire and learnt that they were not willing to authorise force to be used. Yet you and I know that we require force to work and that friendly advice, ultimatums and a conciliatory attitude are only useful when they do not cause the rebels to increase their defiant attitude. When affairs here come to such a pitch that the authority of the Government ( is thus defied, the desired result can only be produced by the use of force. “ When can I cure you ? The blistering iron is the last resort for a cure.” (Sadi.) (In JPrince Farman Farma’s own handwriting.)

Replying to his question, I said I had had no answer from you to my telegram (No*. 361) but thought that I could nevertheless safely give him my personal assurance as to rate of exchange for Moratorium and had reason to hope that His Majesty’s Government would not refuse overdue instalments (your telegram 287) if the composition of the new Cabinet was satisfactory.

As to subsidies I had no indication; the sum he mentioned was enormous; and His Majesty's Govern ment would probably reply that their decision would depend on the proved goodwill of the Cabinet simply and should any be granted there would be conditions such as rigid of His Majesty’s Government to discontinuance of it, if attitude of Persian Government alteied and perhaps also settlement of advances for Ears, &amp; *. Nor had 1 anything to say about supply of arms. His Majesty’s Government must insist ou its recognition of South Persia Rifles during the war but I thought there was disposition on their part to find soiu- f.ton as to subsequent future of force acceptable t&gt; Persia and I might even b&lt;&amp; able to'suggest to them some immediate concession, the appointment of a suitable Peisian to a high post in it. Presence of Vossuk-ed-Dowieh in Cabinet would weigh much with His Majesty’s Government, I thought, but they would not object to Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik as President. Replying to a parti cular enquiry regarding the mixed financial commission I said I could not h &gt;]d out any hope tuat His Majesty’s Government would agree to its d.ssolution. ti 'td-'t VV,O' \ \ 8 I A concession on this point would be greatly appreciated. Would it be v possible to agree that it should be only control over Moratorium accumulations and that as regards future instalments (and subsidy if any) Persian Govern ment before receiving them should furnish the Legations a list of proposed payments to be made from them ? Control exercised by Commission amounted to hardly more than this. If His Majesty’s Government consider that our interests demand effort to secure more friendly Cabinet, I would recommend my being authorized to give Vossuk-ed-Dowleh assurances in the sense of my above conversation with a maximum limit of tomans 103,000 for subsidy. I should be glad of early reply. Accurate news of Italian disaster has reached Persians and cannot fail to have an adverse effect.
