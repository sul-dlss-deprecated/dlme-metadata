Air : inistry are obtaining list of buildings which they will require permanently at Sharjah, together with list of those which will be available i for disposal.

By the time a decision is reached regarding his claims it is possible that the existing agreement will have almost if not quite expired. I therefore suggest that the agreement be left as is stands and that we make up our minds as soon as possible what our requirements are for the future and what we are willing to pay for them. We may then find it convenient to negotiate a new agreement before the date of expiry • \ of the present one. h 3, The fort at Sharjah is still manned by B.O.A.C. personnel and I understand from a B.O.Aj C representative, who recently visited Bahrain as a member of the air survey party that it should not be difficult for the Corporation / to arrange I S. 8 (LnrjJp).

I am particularly anxiou§ that the B.O.A.C, should continue to man their wireless station at Sharjah as they make this available for local private and Commercial traffic. If the Royal Air Force take it over this will presumably no longer be the case. Further if the B.O.A.C. continue to hold the fort even with a skeleton staff it will make it easier for us to leave the civil air existing/agre^ment in its present form. Provided therefore there is no objection from the point of view of the Air Ministry I should be grateful if the B.O.a.C . would be asked to continue to hold charge of the fort and to work their wire less station. 4, With reference to paragraph 4 of your Express letter. The 3haikh agreed to grant facilities to the Hoyal Air Force for the duration of the war only vide papers forwarded under this office printed letter No. C/66 dated the 9th March, 1942, and would be entitled as a min imum to charge ground rent for the area occupied by them from the date of cessation of hostilit-. - * ♦ i^es with Japan or from that of the official termination of the war.

These are immediately adjacent to the main part of the Royal Air Focre Camp and it would appear to a layman that if these w«re to be taken over by the Shaikh and occupied by locals some embarrasment would be caused to the R.A.F, in the adjoining camp. 6, If my proposal in paragraph 2 is accepted may I kindly be informed of the future f requirements of the R.A.F, and the B.O. a.o.

Dear colonel Hay, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter NO .210 -S of the 4th February, 1947? 2. My opinion is that before we open negotiations for a new civil air agreement, we should clear up with the shaikh of Sharjah the points outstanding under the current one. If we do not. It seems to me that our chances of negotiating successfully will be pretty small. 3. I think, therefore, that the shaikh's request for an increase in his subsidy should receive consideration, and a definite answer, one way or the other, given to him. As I have said in paragraph 3(1) of my Express Letter No.c /94 dated the 17th January, 1947, if the subsidy could be increased I think we should benefit. I appre ciate tnat there may be difficulties in asking the Air Ministry for an Increase at tills stage, and I would forego this point if the shaikh is met over rent for the R.A.F. area. 4. As regards rent for that area, I can see no excuse for not paying a reasonable sum. The war with Japan ended about 1^ years ago and the R.A.F. seem to have settled down in the area they require and all outlying R.A.F. property brought within this area. His Majesty's Government benefited by the Shaikh's loan, and now that the war is over I consider that from the political angle we should make a gesture. This need not be too generous for although the Shaikh loaned the land he received com pensatory benefits. 5. As regards the quid pro quo, as you say apparently only a few huts (which, by the way, are made of cement bricks) situated within the area are likely to be declared surplus, and as undoubtedly the K.A.F. do not want the Shaikh In occupation of huts in their enclosure, it would u be better to keep them, or falling that to tell the Shaikh V ' to remove them. Unless we hear from the India Office, cf. paragraph 4 of India office Blxpress Letter No. Ext. 8473/46 of the 30th December, 1946, that buildings of value have been declared surplus, the question of a quid pro quo should, I suggest, be dropped. The value of those pointed out to us is negligible. /6. In my opinion The Hon'ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C .S .I., C.I.K., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain .6, in my opinion, only by deciding the above points now shall we be ready in time to open negotiations for the new agreement which could be based on the final settlement of the current agreecient, the alterations to which need never be incorporated in writing. Accumulated moneys which might be agreed as due to the Shaikh could be paid to him in a lump sum. fhis should act as a sweetener. I think, therefore, that we might act on paragraph 3 of India Office iilxpress Letter quoted above assuming the requirements as indicated in India Office Express Letter No. Rxt.5156/46 dated the 30th July, 1946. 7. As regards paragraph 3 of your demi-official letter under reply, I know of no separate agreement between the R.A.F. and the shaikh of Sharjah. 9 Yours sincerely, m. p.s . Draft returned herewith.D.O.

Dear Mills, v Please refer to my letter Kxt. 1034/47 of the 13th October about the cost of civil control and radio staff at aerodromes in the Persian Gulf (your reference R. 42014/47PG2). 2. I enclose for your information a copy of letter No.1823-3 dated the 21st October from Sir Rupert Hay, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from which you will see that he considers it possible that we may have to pay more for the renewal of existiug air agreements with the Gulf Rulers and that to asJt them to contribute to the cost of aerodrome facilities is out of the question. 3. Hay points out that, as things are at present, the States concerned derive little, or no, oenefit - at least so far as passenger facilities are concerned - from the air services which land in their territories. It is true that Bahrain, and to some extent the Trucial Coast, enjoy the benefit of a regular air-mail and air freight service, but it is open to d©ubt whether the Rulers concerned would consider this a sufficient reason for accepting reduced payments, especially in view of the introductionof a fast mail steamer service and the greatly improved steamer services generally reported in Bahrain telegram No.1011 (a copy of which was sent to Major Jones on the 13th October, Ext. 2132/47). 4. It is perha^a worth mentioning here that, should it be proposed to open negotiations for the renewal of the agreements in the Persian Gulf on the basis of the States concerned contributing towards the cost of aero drome facilities, we should expect the Shaikhs to ask for some assurance that better pasjenger facilities for their nationals should be provided by British airlines than at present. 4 5.

Dear Jackson, , I enclose a copy of the original Sharjah Air Agreement and also, of Residency Memorandum No.l285-S dated the 4th July, 1947, and its enclosures, which you saw when you acted as Political Agent, Bahrain. I also enclose a table which I have made out showing the different kinds of payments, and a modification and proposals for the future regarding them. f 2. Jassim will remember that Ranee visited Sharjah in January, 1947, and after that Galloway (whgi uuftuul as Political Agent) reported to the Political Resident that, as regards the air agreement, the Shaikh of Sharjah's requests concern (i) increase of his personal subsidy; (ii) in the rent of the Rest House; and (iii) rent for the buildings in the addi tional area on the map signed by the Shaikh, received with your memorandum No.781-6/3(B) dated the 11th May, 1944, and forwarded herewith in original (return requested ). Galloway recommended that the Shaikh's personal subsidy should be increased to Rs.1,000/- per month, that no increase should be made in the rent of the Rest House, and that a ground rent should be paid to him since the date of the termination of the war with Japan for the 'additional area'. In further correspondence with the /Political Jackson, Esq., M.B.E., Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah.^7 -2- Political Resident he emphasized that before opening negotiations for a new Civil Air Agreement, we should clear up with the Shaikh of Sharjah the points (just mentioned) outstanding under the current one. The Political Resident, in addressing the India Office, asked that he should be authorised to inform the Shaikh that he will be paid ground rent for the 'R.A.F. Camp' (i.e., the 'additional area') with effect from the date of cessation of hostilities with Japan, and stated that he would then make recommendations regarding the amount of rent which should be offered to the Shaikh. He had asked that he should be informed of the future require ments of the R.A.F. and the B.O.A.C. at Sharjah to enable us to consider what form the future air agreement should take, and what paymencs should be offered to the Shaikh besides the ground rent. Re did not mention Galloway's proposal for an increase in the Shaikh's personal subsidy. The Secretary of State for India's Express Letter No. Ext. 1359/47,dated the 26th June, 1947, is a reply to the Political Resident's reference. 3. First of all, I should be glad of any comments you may have to make on the civil and R.A.F. requirements as stated in the Secretary of State's Express Letter. Then, I should be glad co know if you agree with me that the payments listed in the column 'Under consideration for future' in my statement, are those which we ought to offer the Shaikh for a new air agreement. Those for the guards and the Air Station rent will remain unchanged; I have no record that the Shaikh asked that they should be increased. I am agreeing with Galloway that it is not to our interest /to-3- to raise the rent for the Rest House, nor have I con sidered raising the landing fee. I am agreeing with Giilloway also in accepting the figure of Rs. 1,000/- as the future personal subsidy, and with Ranee for quoting Rs.500/- as the proposed rent for the additional area. The arrears of this should, of course, be paid in a lump sun. ■x 4. I should also like your ideas as to the form of the future air agreement, and should be grateful for draft if you can manage it. future requirements are rather vague it would perhaps be preferable, in order to avoid the accusation that we are establishing an R.A.P. base at Sharjah, for the facilities required by the R.A.F. (and the B.O.A.C. at present) to be covered by an agreement with 'His Majesty's Governmenc or their agents'. This you might bear in mind. 6. I have not checked the list of the R .A.F. require ments given as an enclosure to the Secretary of State for India's Express Letter with the plan which I am sending you Perhaps you could do so and even have an up-to-date map showing these requirements made. 7. You shoxild not, of course, yec inform the Shaikh that he will be paid ground rent for the R .A.F. camp. Yours sincerely. 5.

The arrangements which you propose should be quite satisfactory. Flying Control have expressed concern that of all flights notified In this manner only about thirty per cent arrive or make radio contact. I have ascertained however that departures for Baghdad are notified by radio to our Flying Control from most fields In the Middle East since I am most anxious that there should be no forced landing In the desert without our knowing within a short time, particularly where radio Is not carried. We hope to be able to effect an Improvement In Baghdad control In the near future. In the meantime you probably have Ideas with regard to the non-arrivals. I have recently written to S.P.I, concerning the use of the diplomatic wireless service In accordance with ii.c.a. Office Notice No.67/47. It seems that a good deal of money could be saved by making use of this service for notification of aircraft movements, provided that the Foreign Office agree to accept the additional load, but there may be some practical difficulty In Its use by your Department.

Dpar Dred?e, Weston of International Aeradlo Limited recently came to see the Political Agent about the policy to he followed for applications by aircraft of British and Foreign airlines for land ing In Bahrain, The Political Agent agreed that we could not discuss the matter until we had got It clear ourselves, £ 'TW ' ' •£' ^ 2, On examination It appears that the position In Bahrain (as at Sharjah) Is that notification Is required of the proposed landing of foreign aircraft, but not for British and Dominion air craft, as can be seen from Residency endorsements Nos.2038-S, 185-S, and B/39(81/37), dated the 6th December 1947, the 20th January 1948 and the 22nd April 1948, respectively. Such notifications as we receive (and I am doubtful If they cover all the foreign planes landing) come by telegram, and copies of the original telegram, though not the ones subsequently modifying ETA and minor details are sent to International Aeradlo (as well as the Adviser and the Quarantine Medical Officer) for information. However, I consider that if strict clearance for each plane were insisted upon, it would increase greatly the work in this office. 3, On the other hand His Majesty's Govern ment have no exclusive right for the operation of air line»s through Bahrain territory, and the authority to grant on behalf of the Shaikh the use of aerodromes and the right of transit, non- traffic stop and commercial entry to foreign air craft (see Article 4 of the Bahrain Civil Agree ment) is qualified by their obligations under the Chicago Air Agreement, Applications for foreign aircraft to land here would, however, appear to have to be referred to the Political Authorities because (a) they must give the Shaikh prior notice of the opera tion of all foreign air lines through his territory, see Residency Express letter to . / the India Office, No.0/1781 dated the 30th May 1946, (b) it is not desirable to encourage the landing here of aircraft operating from countries behind the 'Iron Curtain', see Residency Printed Letter No.B/36, dated the 21st April 1948. ,4, We should be grateful to know the policy to be followed regarding requests for use etc. of the aerodromes in this Agency by both British and foreign air lines and operators.

Addressed to Foreign Office telegram Ko. 526 of August 27th repeated for information Baghdad, Bahrain, Kuwait and Civil Air Attache Cairo. My telegram No. 378 to Foreign Office. The Lebanese reply dated July 14th to my note of June 10th ignored the principles raised and stated only that the Lebanese authorities had no objection to the prolongation of the un official arrangement referred to in paragraph 2 of my telegram under reference until such time as a permanent agreement had been made. Under the unofficial arrangement 13 flights per month are permitted. § i\ 2. In view of the statement at the end of page 2 (two) of Persian Gulf Residency summary of events for June (Bahrain refer ence (95/8/49) of July 5th) to the effect that His Majesty's Government's Civilian Air Agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait had lapsed, it was considered inadvisable to press the Lebanese any further. Moreover Skyways, Spinneys and Kuwait Oil Company all appeared to be satisfied with the above mentioned unofficial arrangement and no further action was accordingly taken here. 3. The question of what pressure can put on the Lebanese in connection with air traffic to and from Kuwait was however brought sharply to a head when the Lebanese authorities impounded Bosworth's aircraft on August 24th (see Baghdad telegram No.148 to Beirut) even though normal advance notification of its arrival had been given to Lebanese authorities. This aircraft was released during the morning of August 25th following representa tions to the Lebanese civil aviation authorities and Bosworth has been given permission to embark his clients passengers at Beirut. 4. Eosworth hopes to return to Beirut again under charter next week and he is likely to experience similar difficulties. I gather that strong pressure is being exerted on local administra tion by Lebanese Airlines who wish to reserve traffic tc and from the Persian Gulf for themselves. 5. I should be grateful for clarification of our position at Kuwait. It would be helpful to know from whom do airlines obtain permission to operate their flights to Kuwait (if inaeed they do) and what measures, if any, could be taken at Kuwait to restrict facilities accorded to them should the necessity arise.

Under their letter W 2776 /1801/802 the 16th June, 1948, General Jepartraent forwarded us a statement of prin ciples which It is suggested should govern the joint use of airfields by aiilitary and civil aircraft. Se have now received from the local Manager of International Aeradio Limited a copy of instructions on this subject issued by the Air inistry on the; 11th August 1947. These instruc tions conform with the principles enunciated in the enclo-« sure to General Department's letter. They contain the fol lowing passage:- M The administration and discipline of civilian staff employed by or on behalf of the local Government concerned will be the resFonsibillty of the local Government. An officer of the local Government concerned will be placed in charge of such civilian staff on the airfield 1 '. 2. The feuharraq airfield at Bahrain is a joint user one and so far as it Is concerned, this Residency or the Bahrain Political Agency must be regarded as the local Government. Up to date no officer has been formally placed in charge of civil staff on the airfield and it is clearly desirable that such an appointment should be made without further delay. There are two possible alternatives, viz. the Station Superin tendent, British Overseas Airways Corporation or the local Manager of International Aeradio Limited. The former is locally regarded as the more senior officer, but the latter is resident on the airfield and should perhaps be selected on this account. 3. I should be grateful if you could let me know as soon as possible whether my proposal to place an officer in charge of civilian staff on the uharraq airfield is approved and if so, which of the two officers mentioned should be selected. 4.

Qatar's civil air traffic is not likely to be heavy for some time to come, and is unlikely, as far as can be fore seen, ever to amount io more than a feeder service to Bahrain, with occasional charter flights to other places^ so thpt ncD- thing very elaborate in the way of an airport will be reauired. It is not clear what sort of sn installation the proposed scheme aims at providing, but Qatar would need only the crrest essen tials. 3. The natural runways here are capable at present of taking a ^akota, and with very little improvement could take any aircraft liKely to want to lend in Qatar, so that there is no need for elaborate run-way construction. Similarly, the necessary buildings could undoubtedly be built more cheaply from local resources than the cost of importing a pre-fabric- ated affair. In fact, apart from the rrdio and other special ised equipment, Qatar is able to provide for its simple needs in this field cheaply and without difficulty. 4. I envisage development in Qatar consisting of the gradual improvement of existing facilities es circumstances demand and permit, and as the Sheikh can be ; ersuaded to sk shoulder responsibility for civil pviftion^ which at present he declines to do.

(b) that prior permission should net be required in the case of non stop flights over the ohaikhdems, and in the case of flights for non-traffic purposes, I should be glad if you would let me have your views on these proposed exceptions to the general rule that permission for all flights snould be made thrcugh the diplomatic channel. We are in favour of them} In the case of (a) because it will save a lot of unnecessary time and trouble over minor flights} and/the case of (b) because we doubt whether there is sufficient justification merely on safety grounds, for retaining the requirement. The Ministry are considering whether, as an alternative precaution aircraft flying through the Persian Gulf area should be advised to follow well defined routes. 4, The Ministry of Civil iiviation have examined your suggestion that a penalty should be imposed, without legal process, on aircraft landing without proper authorisation. /but Li eutenant-Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, k, C,I,E, , C, S,I, , Bahrain, ^ p , &lt;31 f '3)1 f2. but they consider, and we are inclined to agree, that although the proposal has the attraction of simplicity and expedition, thert is a danger that unless the fines were fixed at an exorbitant figures, operators in some circumstances would rather pay the fine than obtain, or attempt to obtain, prior permission. We also feel that the absence of legal proceeding might make operators feel that they hud been dealt with arbit rarily and unjuitlyj and it might very well lead to the institution of retaliatory measures by foreign goverximents, whose airfield officials are not as impartial as our own. oi dsuliixt, with these against them under athe solution i»ir eventually ^atar, on 5. We realise however, the cifficulty people by instituting legal proceedings the regulations c .s they are drawn up at prussntj Ministry of Civil Aviation, sUbgest that the best would be to add tTf?o additional aegulations to Uie Navigation riegulfations of Bahrain ana Kuwait, and in the Air i.avigaticn Regulations ol Sharjah aiixi the lines of Article 46 ana 59 the United Kingdom Air Kavigation Order, ir. order to establish unequivocably that landing or picking up or setting aown traffic at those airfields without permission is a contravention of the Hegulationsj and to provide powers iL'.der waich of-ending aircraft would be detained. The Ministry of Civil Aviation have found that ti ese two .regulations enable them to deal adequately with any aircraft which land in this country without authority. 6. We suggest therefore that provisions to be based on Articles 4b and 59 of the United Kingdom Order should be inserted in the Kuwait K«gulations as follows ana that similar provisions should also be included in the Air navigation Begulotions applicable in the other tefiritories concerned Add the followint, paragraph to Article 1, 'An aircraft oi gooas fo. hire # C ilc ^at^-d in vae cairlage of passengers or or re ard, shall not -ake on board or rge passengers o•.* .jooai at any place within the dii territories ox Kuwait except in accordance with the terms of any agr«emo,it iuj. the time being in force •s Government in one Uxatea ivingdom of His iiighness the between His (acting in this ar 1 . on Uehalx Shaikh) and the Ciovernaent of the country in which the aircraft is registered or in accordance with the special permission of Ihe Minister of Civil Aviation in the Uniteo Ki^^dom &amp; ra:ited on behalf oi -.is highness the ohaiiJi and sub J ect to toy conditions or limitations which the MiXi-Lster specxo-y. insert the following new article after article 14:- '(i; if it appears to. e*. authorised person appointed for the purpose by His Highness the ohaikh with the agreement ci Kiw ka^wsty's Government that any aircraft is intended or likely to be flown - (a) in cuch circumstances that the flight would be in contravention of the provision^ or ai-y provision, oi Uiese regulations, or of the conditions governing the use oi the aerodrome or aerodromes at Kuwait, set out in Aiinex 2 to the Heaas of Agreement between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom ana His iiighness the Shaikh of Kuwait dated the 21st June 1949, or /(b)(?9 a ' (b) while in a condition unlit To.' flight whether . the 1'light would other wise be in contravention*-,, ol any provision of these regulations or of the conaitions set out in Annex 2 aforesaia or not} sucn authox'isea person may give such instructions and take such steps by way of detention of the aircraft or otherwise as appear to him necessary in order to prevent the flight, (ii) jui any person con^raveii^ c.y instructions given unaer tha .s ax oxuxwi im siiaj-l be ueemed v .o have contra vened taese negulaiions ana, if an aircraft flies in contravention ox cOi.. such instructions, or notwith standing axiy steps tcjcen oy way of detention or otherwise in order to prevent the i'li-ht, it shall oe deemed to hav* f eiilou to couply vvitn these hegulaticns.

The ministry have in hand the preparation oi i^OT ^Mii or Information Circulars dealiug vith the Gulf aerodromes, but they are not yet in a position to publish them; and they have suggested that for the presant an Information Circular on the linei&gt; of the dra^t enclosed should be issued, i-ou will see that it covers adequately the most important problem with which we are concerned - the procedure for clearing lil^hits and provides that in future all applications with the possible exception of the ca3s&gt;s referred to in paragraph 3 below will be cleared through one central channel - the Ministry of Civil «viution - anu that apart from those exceptions you will no longer be called upon to deal with applications yourself. I shell be very glad if you will let me know whether the proposal meets with your approval} ana whether you think the sheikh of Kuwait would agree to a suitable amenosiant being made to .article 6 of the Civil air agreement, and the other rulers concernea to similar .-menumeiits to our agreem.nts with them, 3. The Ministry of Civil eviction suggest however, that if you agree, that instructions in this Information Circular might with advanta fo '3 be modified ixi iwo respects (a) that you sheulo be authorised to grant permission in tne case oi £,1^1^ ilifents from adjoining territory. (b) that prior permission shoula not be required in the case of non stop flights over the ^haikhdoms, and in the case oi flights for non traffic purposes. I should be glad if you woulu let me have your views on these proposed exceptions i.o the general rule thct permission for all flights saeulu be a.ada thrciitoii tne diplomatic channel, 'e are in favour oi them} in tne case of (a) because it will save a lot ol unnecessary lime anu trouble over minor flights and In the case of (b) because we douot whether there is sufficient justification merely on etj grounds, for retaining the re^uirewent. The ministry are consiuering whether, as an alternative precaution aircraft flyin^ through the rersian Lull area should be iaavised to follow well defined routes. 4. The £iinistr&gt; oi Civil aviation nave examined your suggestion that t penalty should be imposed, without legal process, on aircraft landing witneut. proper authorisation /but Lieutenant-Colonel ^ir Rupert Hay, Ji.C,I.n., C.^.l., Bahrain.COPY but they ccnsiuer, fend we are inclined to r^e, that &amp;1 though the proposal has the attraction 01 siiuplicity and expeaition, there is a danger that unleas Tihe lines were lixed at an exorall&amp;iit rxgure, operators in some circumstances would rather pay tne line than obtain, or attempt to obtain, prior permission. ;.e also leel tnat the absence oi legal proceeding^ might make operators feel chat they had been dealt with arbit rarily ana unjustly; and it mifcht very well lead to the institution of retalldtor^ measures b&gt; foreign goverrunents, whose airfiela oiflciaj.s c e not imyarcial as our own. 5. V.e realise however, tnu dxilicult) oi dealing witn these people by instituting legal proceedings against them under the regulations as tney are drawn up ao present; and the Ministry oi Civil aviation, suggest tiibt tiie best solution would be to add vwo additional .emulations to the ,Hir i'.avi at ion ixefculations oji Bail rain and Kuwait, ai^u eventually in the *.ir Navigation aegalal oas ol' oharjah anu atar, on the lines oi article 4o and ol the Jaited kingdom ^ir navigation Order, in oraer to establisn unequivocably that lanaing or pickin^ up or settint 1 down traflic at those airfielas withouc peri^ission is a contravention of tne i.eguxations; ana to provide poverp unaer wnica offending aircraft woula be detuined. The Ministry of Civil iiviation have founa that these two ^regulations exiaule them to ueal adequately with tny aircraft waich l^nd in this country without author!ty, 6, We suggest therefore timt provisions to be based on iiiticles 4b ana ^9 of the United Kingdom Order should be inserted in the ixuwait iiegulations as follows axxa that similar provisions should also be included in the ^ir x.aviaation regulations applicable in the other territories concerned iidd the iollowinfc paragraph to Hrticle 1, 'An aircraft engagea in the carriage of passengers or gooas for hire or reward, shall not take on board or discharge passengers or ^aoas at any place within the territories of Kuwait except in accordance with the terms oi any agreement for tne time being in iorce between nis majesty's Covernmeat in the Unitea Kingaom (acting in tnis regard on behalf of His Highness tne ShaiK-h) and the Government of the country in which the aircra-it is rogisterea or in accoratnce with the special permission of the iuinister of Civil nviation in the United Kingdom granted on behalf of His Highness the Snaikh ana subject to any conaitions or liiitations which the Minister may specify.'

I have specific Instructions from the Minister of Civil Aviation to request Your Ixcellency to ascertain precisely what action would be required and probable costs Incurred should It be decided to proceed with the Installation of an approach lighting system on the seaward side of the main run-way at Bahrain. 2. The system would consist of the erection of 10 poles (each pole to carry two lights) at Intervals of 300 feet along the extension towards the sea of the centre line of the main run-way. Along the same line an underground electric cable would be Installed. 3. Thus the total length of the approach light chain from the present runway threshold would extend seawards for 1000 yards ina straight line. 4. I understand that a roadway ccosses this line near the threshold of the runway. No pole would be erected on this road. The electric cable would run underneath itjand the cost of digging the necessary trench and fil ling it in across the roadway would clearly be borne by H.M.G. 5. It is desired to know whether the owner of the land involved outside the present air field (believed to be H.H. the Shaikh) would permit the above work to be carried out. hat charges if any he would levy in the way of rent, way-leave, lease etc.? It would be necessary to ensure that the land immediately above the electric cable was not cultivated /norK f, / / i i ii fii nor built upon and that the Airfield autho rities could have free access to the strip concerned at any time and (save for the road- way crossing the strip) have the right to debar access to It by others.

Ideally the local services should be provided by one firm. The Ministry was concerned to see that this firm did not compete with British Overseas Airways Corporation. At the beginning of the year Caton, Skyways and Bosworth were all proposing to operate scheduled services. Our policy at that time was that:- (a) these services should be strictly local in scope; (b) they should be operated by a United Kingdom company; and (c) they should be provided by a single firm. The mutual antagonism of Bosworth and Skyways had tirade amalgamation impossible. Through a misunderstanding it had appeared to us that Skyways had lost interest, •i. • ^ /butbut they now deny this and complain of discrimination. The Ministry consider that provided Bosworth is a suitable person he should operate local services from Bahrain, all the more so since the Rulers there and in watar are reported to have a personal and financial interest in his Company. Since he appears to enjoy local support, he should therefore be protected against competition, which could only result in uneconomic services. The difficulty of refuting the charge of discrimination might thus b met by citing the local support for, and the pioneer work of Sosworth in this field. 2. Skyways have been operating for some years charter services from Kuwait on behalf of the Oil Company there. They can therefore be said to have a legitimate commercial interest in developing aviation from that place. It aiay well be that the Lebanese Government will allege that skyways' operations constitute scheduled services; in that case it may be difficult in forthcoming negotiations in Beirut to preserve their present privileges in operating betv^een the Gulf and the Levant. This makes it increasingly important in the interests of equity that we should offer them the right to operate certain services within the Gulf, and we could authorise them to start a scheduled service between Kuwait and Bahrain, /providedprovided the Shaikh of Bahrain agreed. Unfortunately, this particular sector is already well served by B.O.A.C., Iraq Airways and others, 3. Sir x.upert .lav was sympathetic to the proposal that Bosworth should be protected on the routes which he had pioneered, and the Shaikh of Bahrain would certainly fee in favour. Bosworth has established a good reputation/ and is trusted locally. r. jJunnett . suggested that it might be useful for Sir Desmond Morton to visit the Gulf area to discuss current problems on the spot and to report to Ministry of Civil Aviation. Sir ■ upert liav welcomed this proposal and Sir Desmond agreed to discuss the matter with him. 4. In reply to kt . Karpham, Sir upert thought it unlikely that Bosworth and Skyways could at this late stage be reconciled. hilst Skyways had worked for the Oil Company, Bosworth catered for the Arab merchants in trie i^rea. -it Desmond asked whether osworth would be able to make a profit for his shareholders merely in the operation of local services; Sir Rupert thought that with his very small aircraft he was carrying all the available traffic, and had at least a chance of a profitable operation. 6. ur. Donnett said that the Ministry did not intend to permit bosworth to operate a service to Bombay d.nce His Majesty's Government would then have to offer the Indians reciprocal rights and the latter would compete him out of existence with superior equipment. He might, however, be permitted to operate a stopping service via Muscat, Sharjah and Jiswany to Karachi. Sir nqpert saia that the bulk of traffic on this route would be between Liuscat and India, but even this was a doubtful quantity since there was a fast fortnightly steamer. Furthermore, /Braathens ...Braathens carried some traffic between Sharjah and India, x^r. Darn ett said the Ministry were prepared « to take account of local needs 4f such existed for a service of the kind proposed, and Sir Desmond pointed out that Bosworth might argue that he could only make his services pay by extending them either to Kuwait or to India. r. Dunnett commented that, while Bosworth's fares on the intra-Gulf services were his own business, he would have to submit proposed fares on service to Karachi for approval. 6. Reverting to the question of Skyways, I/Ir. Hose asked whether it would be possible for them to operate services between Kuwait and Dhahran, Baghdad and Bahrain. Sir Ruoert considered that we mi ht offer them to Dhahran and Bahrain; he suggested that we should be discouraging but avoid an outright refusal. ^ir. Rose mentioned that the introduction of Company Law in Bahrain was being considered? if this was done, Bosworth's Company would be able to be incorporated locally. Mr. Dunnett araid he would welcome this, provided provision were made for control over aie-worthiness and crew-competency certificates etc., olr ^upert said that such regulations would have to be made locally and that this could probably be done by prescribing that aircraft registered in Bahrain should conform to regulations in force in the United Kinfcdom. The Shaikh would certainly agree to such regulations. Generally, Sir Kutcrt was in favour of encouraging Companies to register in the Gulf and to get support from local shareholders. :.lr. nose said that it would be necessary to take legal advice on the application of safety regulations to locally incorporated /companies..Companies, Ministry of Civil Aviation would be consulted if legislation were likely to be introduced. (2) A ^ pcm ments with Shar.iah and -atar. Ir. Dunnett explained the inistry's diffidence in concluding agreements with the Shaikhs. The cost of paying rents was of course not heavy, but the concession to construct airfields appeared to them to imply obligations to maintain facilities which might cost rany thousands of pounds. For instance if the Royal Air Force were to pull out of Sharjah altogether, the ministry would have to arrant 7 © for I.A.L, to operate the airport, and this they would not wish to do unless it was used by trunk operators, ir.Paris .said that the public Accounts Comrittee was concerned at the ministry's ezponditure on over-seas airfields, whether on bahalf of the British Corporations or not. At Bahrain this expenditure is incurred in the interest of d. O.A.C . and enables His Majesty's Government to obtain reciprocal, traffic rights in foreign countries. At t&gt;harjah there is no such advantage, and the short- range aircraft landing at the field are chiefly military types and therefore the responsibility of the Air Ministry. The cost of running the airfield exclusive of runway maintenance has been estimated at £30,000 per annum, and this expenditure could not be justified on Civil Aviation grounds alon?. At Qatar the i inlstry has no interest at all, but they would not object to assuming /responsibilityresponsibility provided they could avoid a committment to instal and run ground facilities, or otherwise to incur substantial expenditure. Sir i'.uuert said he regarded the retention of an operational aerodrome at Sharjah as politically very important. The agreement of 1932 had enabled us to build a fortified rest house; if the agreemert was allowed to lapse this fortification would revert to the Shaikh and both our prestige and our power in the Trucial Coast would suffer damage. Furthermore, it is important to maintain air communications with the Trucial Coast (sharjah and i/ubai) for administrative and comaercial purposes, especially in the event of future oil strikes. Hail steamers call only twice a month at Sharjah, anr at present the only rapid communication is by means of the R.A.F. weekly aircraft. 10. 3ir Jesciond commented that the Chiefs of Ctaff might be induced to approve expenditure on Saarjah from the strategic point of view. j -. Paj.'is. said that if the R.A.F. ceased to use the aerodro e the Mr Ministry would continue to maintain the buildings and landing area, but the Ministry of Civil Aviation would not feel Justified in providing technical facilities other than 'en route' aids for the trunk route at a cost of about £5000 p.a. ^lr Rupert said that provide s the runways were usable, and some one was in charge of the post, this would be adequate. The Oil Companies and Bosworth should in any case be enabled to use the aerodrome. Air Kavigation Regulations should be drafted for appending to the Air Agreement. i /ll. &gt; t p^fis0^ 11, Mr. ^aris said that the agreement could be signed provided it was unaerstood that if the R # ii,F, interest diminished within the currency of the agreement there should be no obligation on His kajesty's Government to maintain facilities for local services. bir ^upert said that provided the shaikh continued to receive his rent he would be satisfied, and the problem of restricting facilities could be faced when it arose. In reply to a question kr. Paris said that although the I.C.a.O . recommends certain standards for an aerodrome, there are no regional meeting recommendations for Sharjah, and there is /no consequently^formal obligation on His Majesty's Government to maintain a particular standard of facilities therej We would not thus be forced to close the airport because it failed to conform to minimum requirements. He promised to check with his finance brancn that the Treasury would authorise signature of the agreement. 12, watar. ^ir ^uuert confirmed that his main purpose was to prevent foreign interests from obtaining traffic rights and aerodrome concessions, kr. haris said that the Ministry did not want to instal any facilities but that if it were desired to introduce and enforce regulations they v /ould be prepared to meet the presumably small expenditure likely to arise provided it was understood that it was under taken on political grounas, .air .uipert considered that the Political Officer in c^atar himself would himself be able to enforce such regulations. bir uesmona saia that the Ministry would doubtless be prepared to agree to a form of agreement and to authorise the issue of the necessary regulations. (3) AuDQintment of managers at Kuvait &amp;nu i3anraix.. 13, i^ir .oioert said that his principal purpose was to obtain a manager for the airport at Bahrain who would actas his adviser on aviation in the Gulf, ^ir Desmond agreed that he could investigate the need for such an appointment on the spot, and meanwhile it was loft with the kinistry's iiStablishments Department to make a preliminary approach to the Treasury to get agreement in principle for the appointment. Control of iorei.*:n aircraft 14, The Foreign Office undertook to inform Bahrain, Kuwait arid Beirut ol' the action it was proposed to take against M, E, A,L. aircraft, kr. i ,J.ll s said that the ministry would look into the various possibilities of enforcement action, and said that a ftotam should ue issued as soon as possible, oir ^upert said that the time limit attached to the ' arning to the company should not be too definite. It was understood that if the Lebanese Goveriiment did apply for permission for M.B, a ,L , to operate, then we should grant a permit provided we obtained reciprocal -ights at Beirut for Cyprus airways, kr. i- aris said that Champniss was required to serve with the United Kingdom Delegation to the I ,C,ii, 0, regional meeting at Istanbul between mid-October and mid-November, oir ..ucert stressed the importance of Champniss remaining at Kuwait for the present} in his absence the Political Agent might be able to act. He was doubtful if the local police would be truthworthy in enforcing the regulations, Mr. Paris said that in the circumstances the arrangement for sending Champniss to Istanbul for the Conference there would be cancelled, (5) .Construction of nev. airfielu at Kuwait. 15, Mr, Paris said that the Kuwait oil company had withdrawn their definite offer to help in the cost of the airport, and that B,0,a, C , have said that they have no need for a mjaor operational fdrport there; the only requirement&lt;1^ [W requirement is therefore &amp; properly maintained airport for local two -engined services. maintenance contract is now being worked out with 1C.0,C. as to the airstrip at jihmaai, the headquarters cf the K«0. C. confirmed that they only wanted it for emergency use, so the duplication oi facilities was unnecessary, oir u^ert thought that the present shaikh might agree not to keep us to our promise, and might be content for the present airfield to be properly maintained. i^r. raris said that Champniss' reports showed that the present airfield could be kept in a safe condition if it were surfaced with bituminous material. The main sector Cairo-Bombay requires a staging post in the Gulf, and B.O.a,C. have been looking round for the best airfield. The pierced steel planking at Bahrain will one day crumble away and replacement cost would be approximately million. Dhahran is the best natural site, but its use would involve a uual organisation, both there and at Bahrain, sir .uoert commented that Bahrain was tne safest place for a new aerodrome being an island and protected from local troubles. i^ris assured him that it was unlikely that any accident would occur at Kuwait as a result of the surface of the airfield. It was concluded that it would be an advantage to get the Shaikh to agree that the present airfield is in fact adequate for his purposes. (6) Air France ciirss^ies 16. cir mpert said that the United btates Bousul-Gaueral at Chahran and the united states U.S.A.a.F. Comnander there had Insinuated that facilities at Bahrain were inadequate, especially Tor night use. He suggested that we shouldwe should publicise the results of the recent enquiry. Mr, Paris said that he understood that the report was not to be published but that it exonerated the airport services. Sir Kupert asked if we could forward copies when available to the United states Consul-General and the iiuler. It was agreed that the Foreign Office would take this up with the Ministry of Civil Aviation,] (366/45/50) CONFIDENTIAL w '7- BRITISH HSSIDEIIGY, BAHRAIN. 11+th Noveinb e r, 1950. \ 3^ u As you know the Kuwait J&amp;rnavigation Regulations have recently been revised and a ^e^y of the final edition v/as sent to you with our letter Ho.308/19/50 of the 3rd August in connection with the new Air Agreement with Sharjah. I am to ask you whether you would be agreeable to approach the Shaikh of Bahrain for a revision of the Bahrain Air Navigation Regulations on the lines of those now intro duced for Kuwait, so that we taay have some uniformity in the form of such regulations throughout the Gulf. The principle omissions from the Bahrain Regulations would appear to be those dealing with cabotage and the power to detain aircraft which have been concerned in the con travention of the regulations as in para 13(i) of the Kuwait Regulat ions. The necessary amendments could of course be effected by an ex change of letters with the Shaikh, but it would probably be easier and more comprehensible if a complete copy of the proposed new Air Navig ation Regulations was sent to the Shaikh, and he was asked to substit ute it in toto and issue an Al'an to that effect. In this connection I enclose a copy of the proposed King's Regulation for Kuwait which was not sent to you with our letter No. 308/19/50. We should be glad of your viev/s, but Sir Rupert asks that you should not make an approach to the Ruler without further instructions as we shall have to obtain the concurrence of the Foreign Office. 1 ^Wn C.

I understand that a roadway crosses this line near the threshold of the runway. No pole would be erected on this road. The electric cable would run underneath it. 6. If permission is granted, it would be necessary to ensure that the line immediately above the electric cable was not cultivated nor built uron and that those in control of the air-field could have free access to the strip concerned at any time and (save for the road way crossing the strip) have the right to debar access to it by others, 6.

V/hittle, who has just concluded his visit here, has suggested that I should let you know that he considers the Muharraq. airfield at Bahrain fully suitable for use by Comets - in fact, his opinion of it is even more favourable than Norton's - and that he is strongly opposed to the use by them of the Dhahran airfield in preference to Bahrain on the following grounds;- ^ (1) the strategic factor (Whittle's phrase), i.e. the fact that Bahrain is under British protec tion, (2) the difficulty of obtaining visas for Saudi Arabia, (3) the poll taxes recovered from travellers to Saudi Arabia, (1+) the greater expense of fuel at Dhahran, (5) the greater incidence of dust storms at Dhahran, (6) the absence of passenger handling facilities at Dhahran, (7) the dollar expenditure which the use of Dhahran would involve, and (8) the fact that Bahrain is a more satisfactory 'traffic generator'. I fully concur with Whittle's views. 2. Whittle also asked me to let you know that at a tea party a day or two ago. Shaikh Salman told him that he was willing to assist in every way in the development of the Bahrain airport. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Trott. W.

It is presumed that these charges have not already been introduced by B.O.A.C. and R.A.F. at Manama and Uuharraq. If not, January 1st, 1947 would seem a convenient day for their introduction. . Id./- J.A.N.C., 24/12/46, Reference s.19 and N/paras 40 and 41 ante. I have inspected all the buildings mentioned. The R.A.'s report is not entirely correct. (a) The R.A.F. Sick Quarters are inside the red boundary line. (b) The W/T Station is inside the red rectangle marked on the plan. (c) The American Wireless Station ho longer exists. It was demolished some 5 months ago before the last remaining U .S .A.A.F. personnel left sharjah. The site was 3^ miles west of the camp, well off the area of the plan, as (d) The three wells pumping sites are^mentioned in the plan. They are situated 2^ miles west north west of the camp and existed at the time the plan was made. ■i ^ !&lt; (e), is the open land on which a petrol dump is sited. It is one mile east of the camp and is in process of being evacuated. There is no permanent building , on this site. I have satisfied myself by personal reconnaissance that no buildings, etc., with the exception of (c), (d) and (e) above aave^ever existed outside the red boundary lines. The 0.C-, R.A.F., Sharjah, and his Air Ministry ^^Nw^Department officer both confirmed this. WtnuVtS \ As far as the buildings inside the camp are concerned, our plan is completely oiit of date. Many buildings shown in it have been dismantled and others have been built. It would be quite impracticable as well as inadvisable to suggest that rent should be paid for individual buildings, and I consider the only satisfactory solution is for the Shaikh to be paid ground rent, as suggested in paragraph 5 of p.R.'s X.L.' No.c/596 dated the 4th August, 1946 (s.li7 of p.v.). I have discussed this question with the Residency Agent and suggest a maximum rent of Rs.500/- per month be paid to the Shaikh for the additional areas referred to in para. 5 of the P.R.'s X.L. (s.117, p.v.). it should be specified in any agreement that is drawn up that these areas include the three pumping sites, the site of the petrol dump, and the (now evacuated) site of the American Wireless Station, it should also be laid down that the R.A.F. is at liberty to construct, pull down, or alter any buil-lings they wlsh^providod th6SG a.PG within the r6d bou^^lcl^y , lines,without payment of any additional rent of any kind. consideration whether the proposed pround rent for the additional area should be paid with effect from the end of the Japanese war or from a later date, e.g. 1.1.46 or 1.1.47 in my opinion, however, since the shaikh agreed to the occupation of these additional areas by the R.A.F. free of rent for the period the war only^ he should be paid ground rent with effect from / the# • • • i i /!

PitAJU U.frhfl *r,^ tii h^&amp;f? efcv wi U^ ar^(l^ tA&gt; U I am of the opinion that all that is required after the pre-amhle is a first clause to the effect that the expression 'His lajesty's Government' should be considered to include any duly authorised Agent of H.M.G.; and then the substitution of 'His Majesty's Government' for 'Imperial Airways Limited' in paragraphs 1 and 1 (a); and that the Shaikh sSould then be asked deml-officially as to whether he is prepared to / p. s. /$, o. Ho. m. /13/2 renew the agreement on the same terms. It does, however, seem to me rather a lot to pay Rs.940/- for keeping an area with some buoys in it. '.That does P.O.T.C. think? I think we should renew the lease to prevent the buildings lapsing to the Shaikh and also to retain the •^lighting area for the Company. Otherwise it might be used for mooring dhows. I agree that Rs.940/- a month is a lot to pay for facilities which ag&amp;e no longer be used except in an emergency and if you have no objection to a few days' delay, I can try to negotiate to renew the present lease on somewhat cheaper terms. ltd.

I think that we are supposed to receive notification of the proposed landing of British aircraft and applications for permission to land for foreign aircraft. Would C.C. let me know the position? There are papers. Are I.A.L. supposed now to be operating the aerodrome as 'Agents of H.M.G.'?

RAF used to collect landing fees at Muharraq but this-may now be done by I.A.L. I.A.L. - as agents of H.M.G. - are interested in increase of traffic because of increase in sum collected as landing fees, etc. The benefits of such increase accrue to H.M.G. and not Bahrain Government who get paid only for additional services flown by BOAC, vide articles 9 and 16 of Bahrain Civil Air agree- * ment.
