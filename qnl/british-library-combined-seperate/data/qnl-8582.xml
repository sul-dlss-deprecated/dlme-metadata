The reports cover: the Persian [Iranian] Air Force, including its activities on the ‘Azerbaijan front’ in late 1946, aircraft purchases, the training of pilots, and the Shah’s personal interest in the Air Force; Persian civil airlines, including the activities of the Persian Government’s Civil Aviation Department and its director, Ahmed Chafik Bey, and airlines including the Persian State Airline, Iranian Airways, and Eagle Airlines; foreign airlines, and their flights in and out of Persia, including the British Overseas Airways Corporation, Air France, and Russian, Swedish, Norwegian, and Czech airlines. Observations on airfields and landing strips in Persia are attached to several of the summaries as appendices. These vary in the level of detail given, but can include: location; landing area dimensions and markings; fuelling, repair and medical facilities; accommodation; transport links; and meteorological information. Also distributed throughout the file are periodic reports on the numbers of aircraft in Persia, listing owner, manufacturer, engine, and whether the aircraft is in a serviceable or repairable state.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the front of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Director General of Civil Aviation</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Iranian Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Attaché, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Air force</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Iran Air</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aircraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000043#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
