It specifically concerns irregularities in the receipts issued by Beckee Marifa, who is the widow of both, and therefore entitled to two company pensions. Her receipts from the pension of Aga Mahomed Behshanee have been drafted by Mahomed Sadick (son of Mahomed Husain Khan) in the name of his wife; the wife of Mahomed Sadick is also the daughter of Aga Mahomed Bebshannee and Beckee Marifa. Therefore he is entitled to three pensions.The letter explains that this irregularity was perpetuated through fear that the pension would be withdrawn, though no fraud has occurred.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x00003d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
