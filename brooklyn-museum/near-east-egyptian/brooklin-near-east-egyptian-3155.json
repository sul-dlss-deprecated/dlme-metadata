A very long horizontal beaked spout connects with the flat narrow rim of the vessel 's neck by means of a slender \"bridge\" with a small curving animal head. The base of the spout has an angular swelling. A small animal-head terminal appears on the shoulder opposite the spout. The painted decoration focuses on a broad tapestry-like band that encircles the base of the spout. The outer diamonds are filled with hatched and checkerboard patterns, and the entire band terminates in a wide crosshatched border with thin radiating triangles that resemble fringe. The beaked spout, which has a diamond pattern on its neck, bears a checkerboard pattern along its entire length. Two large square checkerboards occupy the remaining space at the rear of the vessel. The rim of the vessel has a thin band with \"pendant\" dots painted on its inner perimeter.", "medium": "Clay, slip", "dimensions": "height: 7 11/16 in. (19.5 cm)\r\nlength of spout: 12 13/16 in.
