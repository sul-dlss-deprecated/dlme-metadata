The Inspector of the Indian Post Offices arrived recently in Bahrain and on his request I accompanied him to the Post Office as he wished certain improvements to be carried out to the building. This is the property of the Bahrain State, and the Post Office nays a monthly rent of Rs.200/- for it. 3. _ The situation as regards the building is that it requires whitewashing and generally repairing, the verandahs and floors cementing, provision of a sorting room, provision of an in and out parcel room, and parcel guichet. The Bahrain Government have tentatively agreed to do the necessary work. 'A. As regards furniture, th re is no form of sorting t- ble or similar apparatus, and no proper provision for the keeping of mail secure during sorting and at other times. Sorting is performed by emptying the bags on to the floor followed by a game of grab. 5. The inspector states that he is proposing to move the authorities to instal a post-box collection system and to arrange for a proper sorting table. To achieve this will un doubtedly take a long time, and as t’ ! e Bahrain Petroleum Company are interested in an efficient mail system the Chief Local Rerresentatiye has volunteered to provide the necessary furniture. He tells me that he would not ask for payment if that presented difficulty. 6. I do not like accepting presents for the 1 ost Office but the present lack of system reflects badly, and in order to speed things up I suggest the offer may be accepted. I should be grateful for confirmation. 7. As regards the opening of a Post office in Muharraq for which last year the Agency took so much trouble to find accommodation and which was turned down in India as eing unsuitable, the present Inspector, Nr. Fingorani, informs me that he is looking for fresh accommodation. He agrees that a sub-Post Office should be opened at lluharraq. 8. Incidentally the Inspector informs me that the Bahrain sub-Post Office makes a profit of from 8 to 9 thousand rupees a month. He hopes to send one more clerk. Sd/- A, C . Ga 11 O' ay .

Both these buildings are to be demclised to make way for new blocks of offices. By the time this work is taken in hand the premises now used as offices by the Food control Department will, it is hoped, become vacant and these would in my opinion be very much more suitable for a Post Office than the present building.

In this connection I am writing you a letter stating that according to the terms of the lease for the Post Office we are giving one year»s notice to the Postal Authorities.

April 7, 1946. With reference to the agreement for leasing the building in the customs square, Manama, to the post Office, of which a copy was sent by you to me with your letter No. 918-14/10 dated 50th Mareir 1944, I should be grateful if you would inform the Director General that the Bahrain Government desires to terminate the agreement by giving one year^ notice, from 15th April 1946, according to Article 5 of the agreement. Z . The reason for the termination of the agreement is the decision of the Bahrain Government to carry out an important town improvement and building scheme in and in the vicinity of the customs square which will necessitate the demolition of the building now used as a Post Office as well as the adjoining building. 3. For your information the general plan is as follows The sea between the customs pier and Hilal Building is to be reclaimed. The Import Shed, south of Prior Road and behind the Police Station is to be removed, the main bazaar street running north-south is to be widened and a line of 10 shops are to be built on its western side on ground now occupied by the Import Shed. H. B. M T s Political Acertt. Bahrain. Memorandum: - Director of posts and Telegraphs, New Delhi, as a 2/—61 A new Import Shed is to he built on the reclaimed ground west of the present pier. The pier shed is to be moved to a position west of its present site. The Post Office and adjacent building are to be demolished to make room for a new building which will for the widening of Prior Road. The new building, which will contain offices, will be of similar style to the present customs house and the same height as His Highness’s, building which is leased to the P.C.L. The customs square will be enlarged by the inclusion of a portion of what is now the pier entrance, the south line of the square will be a continuation of the line made by the frontage of the Customs House and Passport Office. The rails crossing the square will be removed. Eventually the lane on the west of the Import Shed will be widened into a street and shops or offices built on its eastern side, on the site of the Import Shed. 4. This plan is intended to improve the appearance of the centre of the town, to afford better and quicker facilities for dealing with cargo and to provide a number of new shops and business premises, which are badly needed and which should produce substantial rents for the Government and to supply more office accommodation for the staff of various Government departments who are accommodated, in many cases, in dark and overcrowded rooms owing to the lack of suitable buildings in which to house them. 5. Preliminary plans for this work are now being prepared. Adviser to the Government.D.O.No. 1159-14/10. 13th April, 1946. Will you please refer to your memorandum No.708^ A dated the 6th April, 19467 2. Please let me know what your proposals are for housing the Post-office since you wish to demolish the present building. If indeed the Post-office is to be removed, some other accommodation must be prepared during the one year period.

Dear Mr. Belgrave, Will you please refer to P Colonel Galloway's demi-official letter No.1159-14/10 dated the 13th April, 1946, and let me have a reply as early as possible? C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Govemraent of Yours sincerely, Bahrain, Bahrain, C.srr No* 1389-14/3 Political Agency, Bahrain, The 1st of May, 1946 The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushirc MEMORANDUM Reference your telegram No* A/559 dated the 4th of April, 1946* 2* The present shortcomings in the Bahrain Post Office are largely due to two causes* The first is the Inadequacy of the present building and its furniture. This question is under correspondence with the Adviser and he has been asked to confirm that better accommodation will be provided when the present lease expires next April* 3. The second cause lies in the fact that the post . office staff, from the sub-postmaster downwards, are badly paid, over-worked and, with the exception oi the sub-post master himself, are not provided with decent living accommo dation or adequate allowances in lieu* In this connection I attach a statement giving the present pay and allowances of the post office staff which compare most unfavourably in the case of clerks with the rates paid to persons of similar status in the Persian Gulf clerical cadre. 1 also attach a statement showing the volume of work handled annually by the post office since the year 1938* This statement,* however, fails to ciiUwtstrate the increase of work which has occurred during the war years through the sale of war bonds and certificates. Work is licely to increase still further owing to the withdrawal of censor ship regulations and the provision of more frequent air ser vices to Bahrain* A larger volume of mail is also likely to result from the rapid post-war expansion of trade between this island and the outside world. 4. I am informed by the Sub-postmaster that at least one additional clerk and one additional postman (with a bicycle) are required to enable his staff to cope with the present volume of traffic, and in due course the staff will probably require to be augmented still further. 5. The revenue at present earned by the Bahrain Post Office is approximately Rs. 12,000/- per month and is steadily increasing* Since the Bahrain Post Office shows a considerable profit there seems little excuse for the poor rates of pay now received by its staff, and so long as these low rates are paid there is little likelihood of keen and efficient applicants coming forward for employment in Bahrain. 6. The Sub-postmaster himself is only on the scale of Rs.50--5--150, which is the same basic rate as that of his clerks, and compares unfavourably with the scale of the Agency clerks who draw Rs.120--6--150--10--250* In my view the Sub-postmaster, who holds a most responsible post, and handles large quantities of valuable articles in transit besides vast amounts in cash and stamps, should be paid at similar rates to those given to Special Grade clerks by us, i.e. Rs.250--10--300. /7* The\' ?• The present Sub-postmaster is satisfied with his own rent-free quarters but considers that the house rent allowed to his staff and the special pay, which is equivalent to our Gulf Allowances, should be Increased to rates similar to those paid to clerks of equivalent status in this Agency. I agree that this should be done, and further suggest that the maximum limit for retirement to post office employees in Bahrain should be fixed at 25 years service or 50 years age limit. At present the age limit is 55 years. 8. An additional much needed improvement is that the post-box system prevalent throughout India should be introduced in Bahrain. This suggestion has been made time -and again to touring postal officials visiting Bahrain, but so far with no satisfactory results. i consider that if the defects in the Bahrain Post Office pointed out in this letter are remedied as suggested, the local postal services should rapidly improve. In the absence of the Political Agent, Bahrain.Jtr Adviserate, May.2, 1946 Reference your D.O.ITo. 1^09-14/10 dated 13th April, 1946, this is to confirm that the Bahrain Government is willing to make available as a temporary measure the northern offi ce which is now used by the Mood Control Department for the Post Office when tiie present building is demolished. The Bahrain Government is prepared to consider leasing to the Postal authorities a building in the new line of shops which are to be erected on the site of the^present Import Yard for a permanent Post Office^in the building which is to be erected on the site of the present Police Station and Post Office. Lieut. Colonel A.C. Galloway, Q.B.Y., E. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. VD.O.No. 1553-14/10. 18th May, 1946 My dear Belgrave, Please refer to your demi-official letter No*9ir-9A dated the 2nd May, 1946. 2. I find the Bahrain Government's attitude towards the Post-office a little difficult to follow. As you will realise, the Post-office is one of the biggest administrative amenities of Bahrain and it is essential that it should be properly accommodated. We should try to avoid looking upon it as a sort of charitable organi sation for in fact the Post-office is prepared to pay a good rent for the right type of building. 3. The shop which you say you may be able to give them would not be at all suitable. Perhaps you could go into the proposition of constructing a building for the Post-office on a central site for lease to the Post-office. Failing this perhaps you could incorporate it in the adminis trative block which you propose to erect. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Bsq., C.B.d., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain.

The cost of the building as planned at present would probably be about Rs.80,000/-, the value of the ground, 3460 S/F at Rs.10/- per S/F wouM be Rs.34,600/-. The approximate rent would be Ri.B,000/« - Rs.6000/- per annum. 2) If another floor were added the additional cost would be in the neighbourhood of Rs.75,000/- the rent would be correspondingly increased. 3) The site is on ground reclaimed from the sea and the cost of building will be affected by the distance from the surface to the rock bottom which cannot be ascertained till excavations have been undertaken. \ /\ 6*7 3-2L Adviser to the Government. f .'n / JM.

The site in question is the most valuable locality in Manamah; Rs. 7/- per square foot was paid^ recently -p 0 r» a site some distance from this location which was not so central where the ground was not ao completely reclaimed. The valuation may appear to be high but owing to the prices now obtaining for land in the Manamah bazaar area 1 do not think it is unreasonable. 2. The proposed Post Office and the new Police Station form one frontage. The rooms in the nats above these buildings are to be built on the walls of the around floor rooms. The Post Office building will carry two good flats containing about five rooms in each, these flats would be suitable for Europeans but one of them would be let to the Post Master. The Police Station and the Post Office are in fact one building and tne lats above will be built on one plan with a single frontage. The appearance of the building would be spoilt if the flats over one half of it differed from those on the other half, 1 would suggest that only the Postmaster should be housed above the Post Office, not the three :lerks.

Admittedly the site in question is valuable, but so, too ; are the amenities orovided by the Post office, and as it is obviously of benefit to the State and the general public that the new Post office should be in as central a position as possible, it is considered that the rent of the new Post office should be based only on the cost of the building itself, and not on that cost plus the estimated value of the site. The Postmaster is compelled by Posts &amp; Telegraphs regula tion to live on the Post office premises, and is entitled to rent free accommodation. The rent for the Post office build ing should, therefore, include the rent of. the Postmaster's quarters. 4. As regards the detailed lay-out of there quarters,•the Director of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle, has recently made certain requests and I am addressing you on this subject in a separate letter. 5.

Subject*- Copy of extract of para 17 from Persian Gulf Administration Report. Sir, With reference to your memo No.IR-8376-N/46 dated the 22-9-1946, I am directed to submit my report regarding accommo dation and furniture as under *- 1. Accommodation * The present Post Office building which is a rented one belongs to the Bahrain Local Government and was secured for us by the Political Agent at Bahrain. We xtaxy always seek the assistance of the Political Agents in securing houses for Post Offices in the Persian Gu^l Section. If they secure us buildings of the type which they subsequently condemn we canjaot reasonably come in for critism on that account. If the Political Agent Bahrain is in a position to get us a better building, we are prepared to have it even on payment of a higher rent. 2. Furniture * Only recently furniture worth Rs.1218/- was made by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and supplied to the Post Office at Bahrain. We are anxious to provide good furniture for every post office in order to maintain, the dignity of the Indian Post Office. It appears that the tendency to economise under all heads of expenditure and to carry on with the existing furniture, with repairs as far as possible on account of War, has been responsible for the poor show. Now as the funds permit,we are trying to improve the look of the Post Office with better furniture and it is hoped that in course of time much would be done in this direction. I have etc., (Sd) for DIRECTOR.i^tT) No. of 1366 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, End j/Awal, 1366 March E3, 1947. H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Bahrain Receipt \J* . tk Memorandum:- With reference to your Nos. 443-14/10 dated 9th February 1947, 466-14/10 dated 11th February 1947 and 8E4-14/10 dated 15th March 1947, the new Post Office is part of a block of buildings which includes a Police Station and three flats, on the first floor. To conform with the requirement s of the postal authorities it would be necessary to change the whole lay out of this building. As the residential part, on the first floor, is a flat it is impossible to provide a courtyard, though some open roof space will be available. The size of the rooms conforms with the ground floor structure and the frontage is identical to the frontage of the other half of the building so that the whole face of the building follows one design. 2. There are two flats above the post office one of which can be hired by the Postmaster, it will consist of two rooms, 18 x 10 and 18 x 11 and one 18 x 9 with a kitchen, bath room and lavatory, with an open seae roof space and a veranda on the north only. 3. The authorities in India probably do not realise that the building is in the centre of the town in a comparatively restricted area and that the size of the rooms is dependent upon the ground E/—2 floor walls, if the authorities are not satisfied with the proposed building it might be possible to come to an arrangement with His Highness Shaikh Sulman for a post office and Postmaster’s house to be built upon a site adjacent to Khalil Kanoo’s show room, south east of the P.C.L. building, which is the personal property of His Highness. This site about 100 yards from the present Post Office. A Adviser to the Government S.ZD.0. T70.c/447 The 9th of April, 1947 My dear Belgrave, - ^ please refer to the somev/hat lengthy correspondence regarding the proposed new Post Office building ending with this Agency memorandum No.824-14/10, dated the 15th March, 1947. 2. I am afraid that a perusal of my file has not left me with a very clear idea as to the location and size of either the new post office or the building in which it is proposed to house the post Office and the postmaster while the new one is being built. Nor am I clear as to why it is necessary now to demolish the existing building. It would help me in dealing with my side of the case if you could show me (or have me shown), after my return from tour about the 20th of April, the plans of the proposed building and the site. Perhaps we could visit it some evening or very early in the morning might be better. I shall also be interested to see what is planned and going on ; apart from this case altogether. Yours sincerely C• D. Belgrave, KS(j., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain i Bahrain.D.O. No. 1503-14/10 The 1st of May, 1947 -My dear BeLgrave, Reference the correspondence ending with my demi- official letter No.c/447, dated the 9th of April, 1947, on trie subject of the Bahrain post Office. 2. I understood from you the other morning when you were good enough to show me at site the plans for the improvements in the Customs Square area, that you do not at present want to demolish the post Office building and, therefore, do not require the postmaster and his staff to vacate it. I accordingly assume that the Bahrain Government does not wish to terminate the agreement for leasing the post Office building made with the Director of posts &amp; Tele graphs, New Delhi, by giving one year's notice - as intimated n in paragraph 1 of your memorandum No.723-9A, dated the 7th April, 1946. Will you please confirm that the Bahrain Govern ment does not wish now to terminate the agreement? 3. The rent quoted at Rs.5,000/- — Rs.6,000/- per annum in paragraph 1 of your memorandum NO.2098-9A, dated the 5th October, 1946, inflated though it is, is presumably for only the ground floor or working part of the projected post Office building. Could you -give me an idea of what the rent is likely to be for the ground floor cum flat above** Could you also let me know, even approximately, when the new post Office building and flat which could be allotted to the postmaster is likely to be completed? Lastly, would you kindly let me have a plan (if available) of the flat proposed for the postmaster so that I can forward it to his superiors in India? yours sincerely C.D.

V/ W VA V J-XX^ 1st May 1947, on the subject of the Post Office, our building programme, which includes demolishing the old Post Office and building a new one has, unfortunately, been somewhat delayed and there is no possibility of the particular work which affects the existing Post Office being completed during the present year. Under these circumstances the Bahrain Government wishes to withdraw the notice of one year which was given in my letter No. 723-9A dated 7th April 1946. 5 2. The order of priority in the work on the new buildings in the neighbourhood of the Customs Square is as follows; (1) Pier sheds, Passengers Baggage and Passport Shed. (2) Demolishing old Import Shed much of the material of which is to be used on the new pier sheds. (3) Construction of nine shops on site of east side of the old Import Shed. (4) Police Station and post Office. (5) Flats above Post Office. (6) Demolition of old Post Office, police Station and Rest House. (7) Construction of new offices on site of old Post Office and police Station. 3. The situation at the moment is difficult owing to the absence of a responsible P.W.D. officer but I can definitely state that the Post Office will not be demolished for at least another year. 4. The estimate for two flats above the Post Office, European style, is Ik.80,000/- therefore one of these will cost about Rs.40,000/- so the rent of the Post Office and flat will be in the neighbourhood of Rs.6,600/- per annum. 4 C.J.

B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - The new Post Office will shortly be completed. It has been built on the lines' which were suggested by the Postal Superintendent and has been equipped with electric lights, sanitary fittings etc. The premises cover an area of 3672 feet super, which is more than twice the area of one of the new Government shops. The shops have been let for Rs.350/- per month and I suggest that the rent of the Post Office should be Rs.700/- per month. The Bahrain Government is willing *//' to prepare a lease for the Post Office for a period of ten years with the condition that should the Bahrain Government assume control of postal affairs in Bahrain, which is His Highness’s most earnest wish, the lease will be terminated. The lessor will be responsible for major repairs and the lessee will be responsible for minor repairs. 2. Two European flats are in course of construction above the Police Station and Post Office. The one above the Post Office is large, it contains three bedrooms, a dining-sitting room, kitchen, two bath rooms, servants room and boiler room, a large area of veranda and a good flat roof, the flat over the Police Station is on similar lines but is smaller and has only two bedrooms and one bathroom. Both 2 /—- 2 - flats have access to the streets at the side of the block of buildings. Garages and Gardens are not provided. Perhaps you would inspect theflats and let me know wh ether th e Postal authorities wish to hire one of them. They are essentially European style/'^The rent would be in the neighbourhood of Rs. 250 - 350 per month. We have promised one of the flats to one of the European firms in Bahrain and have had a number of requests for both of them. These premises are being built for letting in conformance to the Bahrain Government’s policy of investing money in revenue producing schemes.

'A copy is enclosed of a memorandum No.1306- 9A of 1367 dated the 28th April 1948 received from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government regarding the Post Office Building. 2. It is requested that the postal authorities be informed of the rent of new Post Office, and that It be enquired from them whether one of the new flats is required by them or not.

Mr. Breach has now moved his staff into the new Post Office building. 3. In view of the benefit derived by the Bahrain Government and the general public from the postal services and the comparitively light postal charges levied, it is felt that the rent both for the building and the proposed flat is very high. It is understood that the rents have been assessed on the basis of the amount received for the lease of the shops. It does not seem reasonable that rent for a public service of this nature should be assessed on this basis. If you see no objec tion therefore would you kindly take up the possible reduction of the rent with Belgrave suggesting, say, Rs.500/- for tie building and Rs.200/- for the flat.

But as this and the rent of the Post Office building was considered high we suggested in our demi- official letter No.3181-14/10, dated the 27th July 1948, Rs.200/- for the flat over the post office and 500/- for the building as being fair rent. The Postal Superintendent is now occupy ing a much smaller flat over the Police Station. It is, therefore, requested that a lower rent may be fixed for the smaller flat. I should be grateful if^lease may be prepared both for the flat and the building. FOR POLITICAL AGENT, BAHRAIN. NNRD.O. No. ?S? Reference your D.O. No.31 81-1U/10 dated 2?th July 1948. There appears to have been a misunderstanding on this subject. The Bahrain Government never contemplated letting the larger of the two flats to the Postal Superintendent and did in fact let it to the Imperial Bank of Iran at a rent of Rs. 350/- per month. The Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran applied for the flat before it was built. Under the circumstances I do not think that Rs.200/- for the flat occupied by the Postal Superintendent is unreasonable. 0. J. Pelly, Esquire, O.3.E., H. B.

Bahrain, 17 th May, 1549 s w Referring to your memorandum of the 15th May, I notice that you refer to the enclosure as a copy of a lease for the Post Office huilding and t' e flat. This was probably an over sight as the lease refers to the flat only, but perhaps you will confirm t 1 at a lease in respect of the Post Office building is in coni'se of preparation. As regards signing the lease, it is understood by iry^ Headquarters that matters relating to the leases of lost Office buildings in the Gulf ./ould be undertaken by the Political Resident; I think it is advisable not to disturb the arrangement, G.P.O. Headquarters will, of course, accept your decision as to terms and conditions expressed in leases, but I should like to draw attention to clause 2 of the conditions in the enclosed agreement.
