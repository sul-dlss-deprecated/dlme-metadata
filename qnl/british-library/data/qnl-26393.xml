I have mentioned in my Monthly Letter some trouble we have been having over purchases made by the Sultan of Muscat of property at Salalah and Maairah from the American Disposal authorities at Cairo* The first I heard of the matter was a telegram from the A.O.C# Aden in which he said he had heard from Cairo that the Sultan had personally telegraphed to Mr* Ramsay* head of the American Foreign Liquidation Commission* Cairo* on the 16th June complaining that the property which he had purchased at Salalah and Masirah had not been handed over to him by the R*A*F, The A.O*C* said he had personally visited the W a li at Dhofar and reached an agreement with him for the retention of the property by the R.A.F* This action of the W a li was not authorised by the Sultan who was annoyed that the American property had never been formally delivered to himself or his represen tative • 3* I understand that what actually happened was that the American personnel who had charge of the property at Salalah and Masirah were given no instructions to hand it over to the Sultan or his representative and so when they left merely passed it on to the R*A*F* who have been using it without any authorisation from the Sultan to do so. The Sultan has now refused to make payment to the Americans on account of their failure to effect delivery and has informed them that he will conclude a fresh purchase agreement' - '* ?hen he is assured that the property is available for delivery and after it has been inspected hy himself or his represent ative. 4. The above refers chiefly to moveable property. The Sultan has agreed that the R.A.F* may use the American buildings and punp at Salalah and the buildings at Masirah which automatically passed to him with the conclusion of hostilities, until the end of the year when his agreonent regarding the grant of facilities to the R.A.F. expires* The R.A.F. report that the pump when they took it over was in bad condition and that they have had to instal another one. It would appear that the American personnel left behind in charge of the property failed to grease it aid look after it properly. The A.O.C. Aden has given instructions that the Sultan*® puap is to be carefully maintained for future re- erection. 5. The A.O.C. Aden was much surprised when he was informed that facilities granted to the R.A.F. in Muscat are due to come to an end on the 31st December next. I should be grateful if you could let me know whether I may soon expect instructions regarding negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat for a new agreement vide correspondence ending with Government of In dia E xpress Letter Mo.D.3865-IO/46 dated the 28th May 1946. ^ \ — 6.

Landis Dean of the Harvard University Law School, as Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, in succession to Welch Pogue. 2. Landis v/ho was born in 1899 and educated at Princeton was one of the early New Dealers and a friend of Justice Frankfurter. Since 1935 he has been Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Head of the Office of Civilian Defence. He left in 1943 to take up the post of American Director of Economic Operations in the Middle East and principal American civil representative at the Middle Sist Supply Centre. His activities in these capacities are well known to you. On his retirement he delivered a bitter attack on British policy in the Middle East and urged that the United States should adopt an aggressive economic policy of her own. 3.- 2 - 3. Although the appointment seems to be v/eloomed by the industry and in official circles in view of Landis' broad legal background and wide government experience, I understand that the staff of the Civil Aeronautics Board view his advent with some apprehension, since he is reputedly of unstable temper. 4. He will be a much more difficult customer than Pogue and may be expected to take a special interest in ^merican Civil Aviation development in the Middle Bast. Indeed, from our point of view the appointment can only be described as deplorable. Please pass Saving to Cairo as my telegram No. 2. [Repeated to Cairo under telegram No.98 Saving. April 4th].

We do not consider that by either of these I agreements can the buildings we have erected be regarded ♦N as belonging to the United Kingdom. on the other hand, we think that our wartime expenditure in providing these •buildings should be recognised in the terms of the purchase or lease of i.^asirah, in the same way as our expenditure on fixed assets was recognised in the Civil Agreement by our being allowed to retain landing and housing fees. With regard to the ov/nership of the buildings erected by the Air Ministry Works Directorate for the U.S. Army Air Corps, we consider that we have no more Our right to construct airfields and buildings in P. A. K.Harrison, Ksq. , India Office, S. W. 1.claim to ownership than if* we had erected these buildings for ourselves. We accepted the Sultan 1 s stipulation as t ownership, which the Assistant- to n.... Consul, ilusc^t, passed on to CaptairPiS.S. Oofran in his letter of the 4th October, 1942. This stipulation was to the eilec * that all stone buildings reverted to the Liuscat St^te after the war. We suggest that it covers ohe re ua value of all assets we or the U. S.^.A.il 1 . choose t leave behind. Moreover, any constructions by the nir Ministry /orks Directorate on behalf of the U, S.A.A.C. at kasirah, Salalah or elsewhere on the Sultan of Muscat s territory will have been treated as reciprocal aid, and whatever claims the U.3.A. may have to ownership of buildings constructed at U.S.A. cost, would not apply to these.

The Sultan has informed the Political Agent, Muscat, that so far as he is concerned there is no objection to the use of the buildings by the Royal Air Force. With the Sultan's agreement, and in order to avoid any local misunderstanding, the Political Agent has informed the Royal Air Force authorities in Aden accordingly. The question of the ownership of the buildings, however, remains to be determined, and it will assume importance in case they are required for post-war use by British 0 air interests.

Sultan *s claim to .jnerican buildings is based on negotiations conducted at Salalah in Sep tember, 1942, details of v/hich are contained in express letter I To.J . 148 dated 4th October 1942. from assistant Political Agent at Salalah to Major iS.S. Cofran, then Supervising Engineer, United States of America Air Eorce, Asmara. (Copy of this letter was forwarded to you under Muscat printed letter C/1141 f 8th July, 1944). In December, 1942 further negotiations tooik place in the presence of Kaj or Cofran in regard to. installation of a tube well with pumping equipment to meet water requirements of the American camp at oalalah. Terms under which permisaion to sink this well was agreed to are given in Sultan’s letter of 15th )ecember, 1942 (copy enclosed), copy of which was sent to Major Cofran by Assistant Political ^gent on same day. Mo written acceptance of arrangements detailed in these letters was received, but in a letter dated the 15th of November, 1942, Major Cofran addressed the Assis tant political x'^gent in f oliow ing* terms : Mission there and all points pertaining to Major negotiations with the bultan of Cm an were cleared. You probably have been already advised. Further our State Department has no objection to my carrying on through Mr. Jackson negotaitiona for minor matters at Salalah.* 3. In paragraph 2(ii) of Political Agent’s telegram C/9- 9 ,_Q f 15 th aupus 1.1942. concerning Major negotiations for facilities for United States of America .air Force, no mention was made of any quid pro quo in form of buildings; and from opening paragraJo of Political .agent's JLetter ITo. C/998 of 6th a.ugutt 1942, to the Sultan, a cb^y of which was forwarded with”'' Express letter Mo.C/lClS dated 19th august 1942, it will be scen _ that Sultan's consent was aslced for and obtained to 'facilities to the United States of America Air Force similar to those already accorded to the British Government for the Royal Air Force.' 4. whether details of negotiations mentioned in paragraph 2 above were communicated by Major Cofran to American Commis si onerate during tzis. his visit to Delhi in November, 1942 or through other channels to the Government of the United States of America is not known; if they were it is possible that unqualified permission to errect buildings at dlalah, Masirah and Ras-el-Hadd secured from Sultan in major negotiations were considered as overriding any such interim arrangements. 'Have been to Delhi co-operating with American Su Itan i &amp; j2 / however, under firm impression that buildings and tube well become his at the end of hostilities and should he learn that united dtates Government held a different opinion, he would be much upset and certainly turn to us for explanation. To avoid misunderstanding, it appears desirable that position be clarified as early as possible. 5» Negotiations conducted by the assistant Political Agent at Salalah in September, 1942, were carried out at express request of the United States of America ^dr Porce Engineering authorities at Salalah with primary object of avoiding any delay in coramendement of ,-jnerican air operations over Southern route. The aosence of any reference in major negotiations to swltan»6 title to buildings was perhaps for reason that as number of Americans to be stationed on this route was expected to be small, question was considered as falling within category of '•minor matters' 1 to be settled by maj or Uofran. However this may be, there ..would appear to be no reason to supppse that the Government of United States of Anerica would not adopt a generous attitude towards Sultan in this matter, in recognition of extensive facilities they have enjoyed in Muscat territory during the past three years. I accordingly suggest that in light of circumstances explained, case be referred to American Commissionerate at Hew Delhi with a view to obtaining confirmation of Sultan’s understanding of position. 6* Sol* of the stone buildings at Masirah are believed to have been erected for the United States of xmerica Air Porce by the Air Ministry ./orks Directorate, and before any approach is made to American Commissi oner ate it would appear advisable to ascertain from director of Civil Aviation, or if necessary from Air }. inistry, the terms under which any such buildings efected for American personnel were build. oQ.. h.

Jacks on, Political ^ent, Salalah, Please refer to Major Cofran’s visit 14 ; our conversations with you on the 2nd and 4t us ak^ti K De cs niber ,/e understand that Major Oofran asked permission to sink a well at Salal&amp;h aerodrome area and offered to leave the well, the tanks and the jumping equipment to us after the present war in return for permission to use the water from the well without charge for the duration of the present war. ./e have considered his proposal and consulted our engineer and have come to the conclusion that the well and installations are not of 0 reat value to us however much thep may cost to install. He i.ave water available, in dalalah town in Shallow wells in sufficient quantities. As for -water for irrigation purposes on the-plain we have recently been to some trouble and not inconsiderable expense to construct a channel from the hills for inis purpose which is now supplying more irrigation water than .the cultivators can use without cost other than the up ke e*, of th e chann e 1. ,/e do not therefore feel that we should be justified after the v/ar in incurring expense in running and maintaining the pumping installation to supply water at a higher cost than the available supplies which are adequate. On the other hand we had looked forwards, to all the personnel on the aerodrome taking water from our channel and*thus making a contribution to its capital cost and upkeep, a contribution which will be le^sseded if the Americans construct an independent water supply. ke appreciate however that a supply of water up to the standard of purity required by their doctors is essential to the Americans and that this may be most easily obtained by their sinking a well as they have drilling equipment available. ]?urther we realise that m they go to the expense of sinking a well they wxli wish to use Hie water for all purj. oses. ke have therefore decided to overlook our immediate interests in respect of Water in the interest of the war effort as a whole and are pleased to allow the.

I should be glad to be informed whether any objection is seen to the course of action suggested in paragraph 5 thereof. 5. Vfnile the Sultan's inclination to consult us -- as in the present instance -- on matters of major importance in his relations with the Americans is all to the good, it is not uco. Hi out its drawbacks. If we show reluctance to assist him he may think that we are disinclined to foster good relations between him and the Americans. on the other hand, if we do oblige him and he fails to attain his object he might be inclined to lay the blame on us. P’or their part, if the Americans learn of our activities, which is possible, they may re pare them as an att enpt on our part to manipulate affairs to our advantage. I am of opinion, however, that the advantages outweigh these drawbacks. 4. Copies of Fuscat letter !To.

Political Agency, ttUSC&amp;ty - 22nd Aprtil, 1946 Sir &amp;1y dear/'Geoffrey, Will you please refer to p«r«graphs jp,, o'f ‘-toy deni-official letter No. 3 621-16/8, dated the 21st April terminates with hostilities, and thatjhe does not wish the Americans to operate on the Southern'Route aft^r the cessation of hostilities under the terns of this agreement. ?or \instance he is not dis oscd to pemit aircraft returning aft^r IthS ton : nation of the Japanese ;Var to lanct on his territory 'without payment. Ho feels tJust it is now tine to draw the attention of the U.3.A. Governnent to the above views, and to sug est the early opening of negotiations. 3. There will be numerous reasons for his wishing to adopt this 'ttituoe, and the following occur to no. At present hundreds of planes a month land in his territory in return for which he receives nothing. lie is probably resenting the easy terms he made at the outset, and wishes to extract payment as soon as possible. secondly, he nay only - be putting out a fooler to discover as early as possible the American attitude towards post-war air-routes through his territory. Were hd in possession of information on this he would be in a better position to negotiate with us when the British air-route policy is settled. Or again he nay be thinking that by an approach to the Americans he will ' force us to come into the open with our plans. 4. The Gultan is entitled to address the United States Government independently of us, but he is at a loss to now what terns to use and wishes our assistance. A definite reply is deferred till his return to Luscat when ho will raise the subject again. The natter is somewhat delicate and were the dultan to write the lott- r, with or without our help, it could not but bo looked upon as ungracious, to say the least of it, in Washington, and most certanly would not enhance the Americans* goodwill towards hir . Besides which, to ry way of reading the papers, it could bo argued that he has not the right to shut down on the Americans immediately the war Is over. Tliere is, however, room for doubt for while in the letter to the Jultan requesting facilities (vide para 2 of this office letter No. C/998 of the 6 th August, 1142, copy enclosed for reference) it says on the one hand that the facilities will be required for the period of the war only, and in the opening paragraph he is asked to grant facilities similar to those granted to the Royal Air Force. In regard to these latter a stipulation is made under the War Subsidy pi 1^1^' terms (vide para 3 of this office letter o. C/62A of tie 30th November, 1939) that the payment will continue for a reasonable / naturally period ' fter the cessation of hostilities, whici/i; plies the continued grant of the facilities in return. 2. The Bultan has stated that his agreement with the Americans concerning facilities for t.ho use of landing grounds /5. »-t- °695 £L 5. As wo cannot decline to assist the Sultan I tKink our attitude should be to point out thrt^he himself in the v/rong by ope nine the raatt&gt;r ti ^ and that it would be most invidious, if not impossible in view of the terms of the granting of the facilities, for him to^ differentiate between the r.oyal Piv Tore© a*id the U.S.A.A,:'. We might say that before any action could be t ken in Washington the «ituation wiiJ., in all probability, have cleared which would render his approach unnecessary. A little further patience will almost corta'nly, in my view, serve his ends host. 6. I should be grateful if you would let me know if you approve in principle. Yours sincorely, 3d/- A.C.

We are, of course, aware of the system under which American airlines operate in uniform under contract with the U.S. Air Transport Command. P.A.A. have for a considerable time past been interested in pursuing their aspirations in the Middle East area. With regard to the preference of the Sultan for travelling by American aircraft, we have suggested to B.O.A.C. that if a courtesy free passage is likely to overcome his present aversion from the Corporation^ aircraft they should show their willingness to make the necessary gesture in connection with any future journey which the Sultan may contemplate. You might care to know, however, that the Sultan recently showed his appreciation of the action of the A.O.C., Middle East, who placed his own aircraft at the disposal of the Sultan on recent journeys to and from Egypt, by sending a handsome cheque for the benefit of R.A.F. funds in the Middle East.

'The Special Senate Coranittee Investigating the National Defence Programme was charged by the senate with the duty of checking on all phases of war production, for the purpose of making certain that we get to the fighting fronts as soon and as economically as possible the weapons, supplies and facilities needed by our armed fbrees* The Congress has a clear duty, for which the people will held it responsible, to see that results are obtained from the billions of dollars appropriated for the war effort. To fulfil these obligations, the Conmlttee has conducted nmerous inve tigations in this country* Much time and effort were expended by its individual members, outside of their other duties as Senators, in holding interviews, conferences with officials repre anting industry, labour and governmental %encies find hearings, both public and private, and in making on-the-grouncl inspections of plants. Much valuable evidence has been accumulated in this way, and ferns the basis for many of the reports which have been filed witfc Senate. /The2 The Conmittee Is gratified that its efforts sad achieve ments have been accepted by the public as beneficial to the effective prosecution of the war. This work will be continued but the Coosaittee believes that it is not enough just to fellow the goods to the Country's borders. There must also be assurance that such goods reach the fighting fronts quickly and in good condition, and that they are, in fact, what the fighting forces have a ked for and need. Also there must be assurance that the vast sums which are being exisndsd abroad for airfields, harbour and rail facilitiee and the like are economically spent to the end that the initial coat be kept to a minimum and that this Country obtain therefrom the r possible post-war benefit and international goodwill.

With reference to correspondence ending with my telegram dated the 17th August 1942, i hare the honour to forward herewith a copy of Muscat Express Letter Ho.C/l0l5, dated the 19th August 1942, and its enclosures. 2. With reference to paragraph 3 (i) of the Express Letter, the Sultan appears to hare conceired a fear and dislike of the Americans. This is probably due to their arrival without his being consulted and to subsequent misdemeanours. The only incidents reported have been that mentioned in paragraph 9 of the first 'enclosure to Muscat Express Letter Ho.C/684 of 12th June, a copy of which was forwarded under my Expr es s letter &amp; 0 . 813 -S , dated the 2nd August 1942, and the firing of revolvers on the beach at Salalah refened to in Mr. Pelly’s record of negotiations. This is not such a very bad record but possibly tnere have been many other incidents which have not been reported or the Sultan may have heard tales from elsewhere. 3. With reference to paragraph 3 (ii), X have nothing to add to the views expressed in paragraph 3 of my telegram Eo .T/612 of 17th Aug ust 194g, 4. With reference to paragraph 3 (iii), i would invite attention to Political Agent Muscat's letter Lo.C/379 of 3rd5. With reference to paragraph 5 [iy) » The Sultan is keepiig a close personal watch on customs matters and is for instance insisting on a strict interpretation of Article 6 (5) of the Treaty. Article 5 (4) (c) of the Treaty does not appear to coyer provisions, stores, etc. landed for the shore personnel ot - is Majesty's Eaval and Air forces. The sultan lias not yet demanded payment of duty on such provisions and stores but would appear to consider himself at liberty to do so. 6 . in his record of negotiations which took place on the afternoon of the 10 th August Mr. Felly has attributed to the Sultan the statement that his heart was ''cold' so far as the British personnel were concerned. To avoid the possibility of misunder standing i would explain that although 'cold' is a literal trans lation of tne Araoic word usee it would in the context be more accurately translated by tne words 'at ease'. 7 . i consider that rr.Fell* handled these negotiations with tact and skill. The Sultan showed his usual astuteness in such dealings but his requests are generally speaking reasonable and the outcome of the negotiations as a whole may be regarded as very satisiactory. it is, i think, very much to our advantage that the Sultan should wish to deal through us rather than direct with the Americans. 8 . 1 am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosures to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, and the Minister of S ta te • Cai ro . 1 have the honour to be, S ir, four most obedient servant, sd.

I explained that I had come to Hhofar to deal with the question of the Americans here, and, as far as X knew them, gave the reasons for the delay in doing so. I then handed letter No*. C/998 dated 6 th August, 1942, to the Sultan. After reading it he said that he was willing to concede the facilities asked since uey were fisked for fry the British Government , for the prosecution the war effort, but that if ^these people” (the Americans) asked themselves for such facilities he would have said 'No” to them. 2* He then pointed out that, while ready to grant the facilities, he must have something, other than verbal assurances (in reply to mine) to reassure him that someone would be 'responsible” for American armed forces, i.e. in cases of their misconducting themselves he must know whom to approach and, he added, must know that the offenders would be punished. I had already, as noted, given assurances that our Government’s representative would, I thought, be able to act as the person 'responsible”. In reply to the question about punishment I referred the Sultan to the Treaty of 1833 with the United States of America. He said that in the case of United States of America armed forces he preferred to waive his jurisdiction. We terminated this conversation by his saying that he regarded the question of the 'responsibility' for the American^ conduct as 'of the greatest importance”. He quoted the case of the Pan American Airways personnel firing their revolvers on the beach at Salalah. Afternoon August 10th . Sultan showed me draft of his reply to my letter. In it he only made the condition that it be 'made clear to me as to on whom responsibility will rest and who will reply to any question that may arise regarding the conduct of the American personnel etc.' There was vague mention of other conditions in the draft which ultimately he stated were t- (i). Americans to abide by local rules existent or 'that may be made'. U' 0, rfitii ***** (iv). (ii) . They should have his guards on their camp and with them outside it. (iii) .They should pay compensation for any damage caused by them, or their aircraft to his or his subjects* property or to his subjects* persons. They should supply (or he should be supplied with ) (a) rifles, (b) medicines in return for these facilities. With regard to (1) Sultan thought he would need more stringent rules for Americans than for British (about whom his heart was 'cold'). I said it would be difficult to have different rules for Americans to those for the British. Discussion on (iv) above. Sultan said, though apparently pleased with the amount, that 200 rifles and 200,000 S.A.A. was not much return for the use of three aerodromes. Drafting of Sultan's reply to my C/998 agreed upon. August 11th. Sultan sends me a pencil draft asking to include in grant of arras as 'quid pro quo** for U.S.A. air facilities i- (1) . Two machine guns with sufficient ammunition, (2) . Four hand machine guns with sufficient ammunition, (3) . Two motor lorries medium size which are used by military men. Explained to Sultan that if his condition regarding the grant of rifles were accepted there will probably be a aelay in supplying them. Aujgust 12th . Pencil draft returned to Sultan. Asked him if he would agree to frame the extra *quid pro quo' above as requests rather than 'conditions'. He demurred at this, and when I again stressed that*) there would probably be a delay in fulfilling them, if these conditiom and that regarding the rifles were accepted^ ie asked me that they should be left in saying that they were not conditions precedent and that he understoodthat there might be delay in fulfilling them. I agreed to letting them stand at that; and handed him back the pencil draft for fairing.Copy of letter dated the 11th August, 1^42, from Hie Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Salalan, to H.b.. s Consul, Muscat, at Galalah.. w*U , e have received your letter No* dated 6 th August, 1942, residing the instructions you received from ^ riis Britannic Majesty’s Government to approach us on behalf of our friend the Government of the United States of americo an- request us to grant facilities to the i^Govw-nment Force similar to those already accorded to the British oovmrnmen for the Royal Air Force and that the facilities requested include my consent to the items mentioned in your said letter for the duration of the present war only# As mentioned by you in paragraph 4 of .,£ e auite realise the vital importance of the Southern /uabi Route t^he war effort of * the United Nations andweareonly too pleased whole heaiteuly to co-operate and to do all we can in tnis matter but we would like to point out, as it is not hidden from you and as far as we know that this is the f ^ that a foreign power other than the British Government with whom Lve m old friendship ana real understanuing and are in close relations with each other, approaches us for such Kind facilities.

On the 25th August you it 25th August you informed me that your at Cairo had taken up with the State Department the mat^w of the transport of air mail between Cairo and the United^/ States. You stated that the Legation were under the l impression that we were endeavouring to prevent the carriage ^ of this mail by Pan-American Airways and that it was hoped ' .. that we would reconsider our attitude pending the \ militarisation of that organisation. 2. I have gone carefully into this question but it seems clear that your Legation are labouring under a misapprehension. The correct position as I am informed is as follows. 3. An agreement was reached between the United States and the United Kingdom Post Offices with the approval of the representative of Pan-American Airways and the British Air Commission in Washington last spring, whereby mails destined for the United States and routed via the trans-African airways system are conveyed from Khartoum to the west coast of Africa by either Pan-American Airways or British Overseas Airways Corporation and from the west coast of Africa to the United States exclusively by Pan-American Airways. Payment for transport on the Khartoum-Bathurst section is payable by the postal administration of origin of the mails to the United Kingdom Post Office. The conveyance charges when collected are/ Mr. WaTdemar J. Qallman, United States Embassy, 5C81 21 SfcH 942 1942 -7 e payable to tho Air Ministry which prosumabl y arranges for any subsequent financial adjustments with Pan-American Airways. 4. As regards the mails which you mention as being carried from Gape Town by sea, these are'* mails destined for the United Kingdom and have no bearing on the question of the transportation of mails to the United States now under discussion, 5. There remains the question of the carriage of mails on the section north of Khartoum. These should be carried by British Overseas Airways Corporation as a result of agreement with the United States Government, whereby official mails only are to be carried on the United States air services in this part of the world and that any commercial enterprise on the part of Pan-American Airways must be the subject of negotiations between the United States Government and ourselves. 6. We trust that in the circumstances you will agree that tho Egypt - United States mail is being dealt with strictly in accordance with the arrangements reached between the United States and the British authorities and that no temporary alteration in the present procedure would appear to be required.OUTWARD TELEGRAM [V- ;Thi8 Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained hy the authorised recipient and not passed on]. \W 12268/61/802) [CYPHER] Y/AR CABIHET DISTRIBUTION .

Continuation oJT previous correspondence. 2* Pan American Airways aircraft which landed here on June 4th left three Pan American Airways personnel without travel documents. 3. The senior of them stated to me that s- (1) • they had come to establish a staging post for a Pan American j service between Khartoum and Karachi, ( 2 ) * that more men were expected within a few days bringing their own wireless installation and other equipment, (3) * that they expected to handle two services per day each way in the near future, ( 4 ) . that their atrcraft carried U.S. Army Air Corps markings, (5) . that they had not come under the auspices of the H.A.F* or B.O.A*C., ( 6 ) . that they expected to carry private passengers if the book ings of Government priority passages permitted it, (7). that they required to negotiate with the Sultan for x- (a) • A camp site in the cocoanut grove, (b) . Employment of local labour, (c) • Purchase of provisions. 4 . I explained that, as far as I was aware, Pan American Airways had no standing here and that if they intended to operate under their own auspices and to carry comercial as well as Government passengers many questions might arise with the Sultan which would delay their operations. 5. To avoid this I suggested that until their status was defined they should s- ( 1 ) * regard themselves as In practice coming under the ausjfcices of the Hoyal Air Force, this to cover questions of use of aerodrome, Customs, etc., ( 2 ) * camp on the aerodrome under the guards supplied for the Royal Air Force by the Sultan, (3) . abide by the Sultan's rules for behaviour of R.A.F. personnel, ( 4 ) • deposit their firearms with the Royal Air Force, (5) . furnish me with a list of stores landed and, ( 6 ) . as persons under the auspices of the Royal Air Force, conduct their business with the Sultan through me. 6 . They agreed in conversation to all except suggestion ( 1 ) but did not answer my letter asking for confirmation of 3, 4, 6 and 6 .——■.■M !■ ■!!■■■■ ■■ ■ ■!■ i ■■i.i» ■ ■ 1 Xliey Jiaci alruudy cautpud on u.ie aoi oarooie • 7* I sn# tne Taiwan iula utomJLn^, tne 6th. in answer 'to ills enquiry about tbo arrival oi 4 sorae /unericanst 1 replied tiiat X had little exact Information but that those that had arrived regarded, themselves as personnel of Pan American Airways and not under the auspices of the Royal Air Force or B.O.A.C., that they wanted to approach him anu engage labour etc. I continued that I did not regard them as officers of Pan American Airways or responsible persons of authority and t2*&amp;t X personally imagined that their Company must be operating unuei th* auspices of tne Royal Air Force. If this was correct I did not think the Government of India would welcome their being obstructed. His Highness replied that if they were operating under the auspices of tne Royal Air Force they should abide by the rules applicable to the Royal air Force. He considered this most important. He continued that he could not recognise Pan American Airways personnel us such but that If they were in Salalah under the auspices of tho Royal Air Force they could approach him through me. Soon after my interview with Hie Highness another Pan A aerie an Airways muehine arrived in a night stop ana to leave here ar. Air lort Jor.ager (corzespoijuing to B.O.A.C*s Station Superintendent) He and the pilot came to see me and after c I had explained the position as I saw it he agreed in wilting \o suggestions 3, 4, 5 and 6 in paragraph 5 above 9 which had already been referred to the senior man of the first party. The Air Port Manager also agreed verbally to suggestions (1) and (2) of the same para, but has yet to confirm this in writing. 9* Subsequently His Highness sent khan Bahadur Shubaily to me to complain that two Pan American Airways personnel were drunk at midnight last night and had tried to persuade the aerodrome guard to take them into the town. 10. He also informed me that the Sultan insisted that Pen American Airways personnel should not leave the aerodrome until they had agreed to be regarded as under the auspices of the Royal Air Force and bound by the same rules. 11. The Khan Bahadur also showed me the draft of a letter which His Highness proposes to send to me. I have not yet received the fair copy but, from my notes of the ^Iraf^, I can say that His Highnessinsisted that the Americans should undertake to be associated with the Royal Air Force and abide with by his rules. Falling this His Highness suggested that he should demand an explanation of their ^ presence here. Further the Sultan reserved his right of Jurisdiction over them at any later date. 12. 1 was able to inform His Highness through Khan Bahadur Shubaily that a more responsible man had arrived} in the form of an Air Port jfsunager, who had accepted verbally all the conditions in His Highness * s draft and had promised to confirm his acceptance in writing. I informed the Khan Bahadur that X Mould answe ' His High ness’s letter as soon as I had the fair copy and as soon as confirmation in writing was received from the Air Port iJanager. 13. If therefore the Air Port Manager duly confirms our conversation in writing the position of Pan American Airways here can be regarded as being temporarily settled on the basis of their being regarded in the same light as the Royal Air Force. The Sultan is anxious} however, and I consider it essential, that their status should be clearly defined with as little delay as possible. jr t i „ i Sd./ Q.K. Jackson. .A1 - Husn. Dhofar 6th June 9 ld42. Dear Mr. Jackson. r Rererence to our conversation of this Morning, regarding the American personnel who €ue now at the Aerodrome. Since you have left a report came to me tnat more American personnel have arrived ana they seem to be of the B&amp;me company. As we have agreed that tne situation about t. eee Americans is not clear. &lt;e would suggest that) if these Americans are not associated with the R.A.F« who deal with us through you, I send for these Americans and nave them to explain about their arrival etc. without our knowledge) otherwise We shall put all our questions regarding them to you although they are by our treaty rights, are under our Jurisdiction. I would like to point our that they are associated with the R.A.F. we would to reserve the right of Jurisdiction over these Americans. 1 have never been informed by our friend the British Government that an American Company will come to Uhofar and have an establishment so that if any conditions are to be made regarding them beside the rules which are alreaay in force be put forward. All what we know is about the R.A.F. and B.O.A.C. only. I shall be grateful if this matter can be settled as early as possible. Further 1 understood that these Americans have some fire arms witn then which I cannot understand why they have imported them to Dhofar. If these people are associated with the Royal Air Force * - i'*-' * *.»* -i, ^JL I-X4 • and all questions are cleared up, i *ould request you to explain to them to abide by all rules and regulation of the country and to submit a list of all articles which they have imported so that cue tom inspection may take place, and they should pay custom duty on all dutiable gooue.

Dear Pelly, Since closing my letter No. J 10 I have received the fair copy of the Sultan^ letterm about the position/ of the Americans, with a apare copy which I am enclosing.

(II) Permission to erect “buildings at Sal&amp;Lah (sic) Masirah and Ras-al-Hadd (including Khor Jarama) and to station formations of aircraft at those places which were (? specific) facilities granted to R.a.F. of which you were generally informed in Muscat telegram C.39 dated January 15th, (III) Exemption from Customs duty in same terns as allowed to R.A.F. reference Foreign’s telegram 6Q39„dated August 1st. 3.

I recommend that the United States Government be urged to accept Sultan’s conditions and offer the following comments regarding themi~ .. . (a) Sultan’s Arabic distrust of foreigners strongly reinforced by rowdyism of pan«Ameriean personnel $ accordingly for day to day working he attaches greatest importance to condition (l) and will not rest happy with verbal assurances of exercise of our good offices in relations with Americans. I recommend an assurance to him that our representative will act for the United States Army Air Force exactly as he does for the Royal Air Force in their respective relations with him. (b) Conditions (3), (4) and (6) will presumably offer no difficulty in acceptance r as (3) is merely equitable while (4) and (5) are binding on the Royal Air Force. Regarding conditions (4) and (5) however, it is to be noted that Sultan contemplates stricter rules for Americans than for Royal Air Force. (e) J learn from Jackson that Royal Air Force Aden Command are trying to arrange that United States Army Air Force at Salalah be under Royal Air Force Command there. If this is arranged it ought to settle any problems implicit in ^a) and (b) above. . . (&amp;} When I stated that if condition (2) were accepted, there would, I tho\ight, be delay in fulfilling it Sultan replied that ho did net regard it, in any way, as a condition precedent. If-fche arms are supplied recommend they should be of British manufacture in view of anticipated requests for extra spare parts later. Also recommend they should be presented through us.

Dear Thompson 9 Your 316/69/42 of the 16th July,1942. 2. I have read the recent telegrams passing “between Bagdad and Minister of state, Foreign Office and Washington on the subject of Pan-American Airways. I have discussed the matter with the A.O.C., with Headquarters, R.A.F., Middle East, and with Colonel Macaulay, who is in charge of the United States Army Air Corps Ferry Service on the staff of General Maxwell in Cairo. 3. xhe United States Army Air Corps is in process of converting Pan-American Airways in the Middle East into a military organisation, but I gather that it is considered necessary to proceed delicately in making the change in order to secure the full cooperation of the Pan-American executives affected by the change. 4. In the meantime. Colonel Macaulay is overhauling the schedule of services operated by Pan-American Airways, and the organisation as between Pan-American Airways, Royal Air Force, and British Airways from the point of view of coordination. I i 5. I had a long and very satisfactory conversation with Colonel Macaulay on the general factors affecting the operation of transport air services in the Iraq^peraia area,from which it was evident that the American viewpoint is generally in line with our own, and is as described in the aide-memoire handed by the otste Department to H.B.M.Ambassador in Washington. Particular points arising from the discussion were: — (1) Colonel Macaulay agrees that an R.A.F. - U.S.A.A.C. air transport organisation shall be set up in Iraq and ne will shortly inform me of the name of the U.S.A.A.C. representative. (2) A schedule of air transport services to Iraq and Persia is being worked out by the American Mission in Cairo, in conjunction with H.Qr.a.F.,M.E. 0 This schedule will, I hope, give greatly increased facilities. (3) Colonel Macaulay will investigate the necessity for the ^ ©st Airport. His first impression was that the delivery of the diplomatic bag would not in itself constitute a sufficient reason fier the diversion of service to Bagdad, and he was sensible of the disadvantage which might result from such an arrangement. 6. There will remain a great deal to be done in the adjustment of accommodation, signal facilities, and general air route organisation, but I feel sure that we are now at last on the right lines, and I am aware of no major obstacle such as cannot be overcome by good liaison. The Counsellor, British Embassy, Bagdad.

No. 1876 Sir: I have the honor to Inform you that I have received a telegram dated July 3* 1942 from the Depart ment of State in connection with the plans of the Pan- American Airways to establish a service between Khartoum and Karachi. The American Mission at New Delhi has informed the Department that the Pan-American Airways has sent some of its employees to Salala in connection with this service. The Foreign Secretary of the Government of India has told the Mission at New Delhi that it would be advisable for the United States Government to obtain from the Sultan of Muscat previous consent for a camp site, local labor and supply of provisions. The Department of State has telegraphed the American Mission at New Delhi that, although it would be possible to issue instructions to the American Consul at Bombay to proceed to Muscat for the purpose of negotiating directly with the Sultan for the granting of the necessary rights in connection with the proposed service between/ The Right Honorable Anthony Eden, M.C., H.P., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, foreign Office, S.W.l. ''''V — ENCLOSURE Tfe Am MAIL LETTE No. aT lAUu 1342 FROIflSeCKETARY, EXURf . 0E» INDIA Offbetween Khartoum and K&amp;raohl, the Department would prefer, unless It should become absolutely necessary, not to have the Consul sake this journey. The itaerloan Mission at Hew Delhi was therefore requested to consider whether it perceived any objection to Baking a request of the Government of India that instructions be sent to approach to the Sultan f s Government on this question on behalf of the United States Government. The Department of State, having obtained certain information from the War Department regarding the new service, stated that the proposed operation of such a service is considered highly desirable, both with respect to the delivery of transport planes as well as the returning of -American Army Ferry Pilots, who will have ferried aircraft via Salala, and for the transportation to Karachi of military material. Pan-American Airways, under a directly contractual relationship with the War Department, will conduct on operation from Khartoum to Karachi for the transportation of personnel designated for military purposes and of military cargo. However, it is desirable that where space is available after military requirements have been fulfilled the planes be permitted to carry any non-official passengers, who may be designated by American Government representatives for the region wherever they deem such travel to be urgently of necessity. The operations of Pan-American Airways in these areas will be under the supervision and/ the British representative in Muscat to make a direct ___and direct control of General Fitzgerald, who has been designated to take command of ferry operations in Africa and in the Middle East. In conclusion, the Department of State Informed the American Mission at New Delhi that in taking up this matter with the Indian authorities special emphasis should be placed on the importance of the new service in the defence of India. I have been requested to ascertain from you whether your Government would be agreeable to the operation of the proposed Pan-American Airways service Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration, For the Ambassador: H.

While we are anxious not to sell the pass during the war for o u ^ ^ commerdial air lines,_we also wish to prevent the^question of air services in the Middle East from becoming vitiated by any Nitrone sense of grievance on our side or the Americans and we feel that these two objectives should be reconcilable* 4. It is true that the militarisation of P.A.A. in.Africa and’beyond of which we care strongly in favpuJ should make our •task much easier. But thbre are/still likely to £e/difficulties. A maior one might well be the quesoion oi theiestablishment of i Anoli cate facilities.! We have! objected to these on the grounds (a^ that duolication is a waste of effort, materials, etc., and (b) that P.A.A. were starting to erect wireless stations and other facilities clearly designed for post-war purpepses. Situations may well-arise, however, where the facilities at present SroviLd or which we are capable of; providing may bej inadequate for the needs of United States air services. The developments in such a connexion would need most careful handling and whether they disturb or improve Anglo-United States relation, must in the long run, depend on the relations existnag between you Lid Fitz&amp;eSrald ancl the R.A.F. and P.A.A. authorities on the spot. 5.

S^th June, 1942, eeeeeeee Following is text of Aide Memoire received from the State Department in reply to representations based on -vour telegram No * 2 j50* Begins; On April 15th, 1942 the British Embassy handed to the Department of State an ai de-m emoire on the subject of Pan American Airways services’ in the Near and Middle East, / Reference was made to an attached copy of a note dated February 24, 1942 addressed by Mr. Eden to the United States Ambassador in London on the seme subject. With regard to the air services presently carried on by Pan American Airways Into Egypt, and from Cairo to Basra, note is taken of the^fact that subject to the approval of the British military authorities, the Egyptian Government would be prepared to grant to Pan American'Airways facilities for operating special air services to meet the requirements for official passengers, mail or. freight; and that the British Government believes that space in such services in. excess of United States military requirements should be confined to material connected with the war effort of the United Nations, and that British and Allied military material should' have priority after United States /military material. It is the view of this Government that Pan American Airways, in respect of the services to Egypt, and from Cairo to Basra, is operating a facility for the benefit of the Government of the United States and the United Nations. As this is done at the expense of the United States, it would seem that the United States should be free to make use of any unfilled space on these planes for non-commercial, civilian use approved by the United , States authorities in the region. If the phrase r, material connected with the war effort of the United Nations” is interpreted in this sense, and is not restricted to what may be regarded as ’’military use’ 1 , this Government could accept the point of view of the Aide-memoire under reference. This Government is not prepared to accept without 1 qualification the suggestion that British and Allied military material should have priority after United States military material,irrespective’ of circumstances. It is believed that the needs of the situation will be adequately met if the competent authority of the United States on the ground is instructed to give full consideration to British and Allied military needs'^in determining priorities. It will readily be appreciated that travel for diplomatic and other government personnel, though civilian, may in many instances outrank in necessity non-exigent space requirements for British and Allied military material.

There is reason to suppose that the company are being supported in their efforts by the United States Chargd d'Affaires and that local firm Dwyer are also interested 0 I suspect the company’s object is to present the United States Government with a fait a-QOQmnli which even if the latter wished they y juJG far/'' difficult; zo ignore. Fan American airways can no doubt mobilise ample 'political' support in the United States. It is perhaps worth recording in this connexion that when Mr c Kauffman, the lease-lend expert attached to the United States Embassy at Khorramshar passed through Bagdad recently ( see my telegram 495 to the Foreign Office repea ted vc a v-jtgjou as Nq^ 36 SavingjUie happened to mention that the company ~ they had had a 'raw deal' up to date over the carriage of airmails. 2. In the light of the foregoing I feel the sooner the whole matter is settled with the United States authorities the better. So far as Iraq is concerned the Counsellor spoke to the acting Minister for Foreign affairs on June 3rd and left with him a [grp* undec. ?memorandum] asking that all local government departments be warned to give no encouragement to the companies advances and I am hopeful that action will be taken, Pan-American are however probably ready to pay heavily for possible benefits, if their endeavours to enlist ground crews are any criterion. I am informer that they have already offered certain B. 0 c,xi,C o employees much higher pay than they are now receiving. 3 .

Cairo-Basra Service : Pan-American Airways are apparently operating two services a week to Iraq presumably via Palestine and we understand from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad that they have informed Iraqi Government that they hope to operate not only a military service in war time but also a commercial service afterwards. As regards the military service you will see from our telegram N 0 .UO 8 to Bagdad that we are willing to permit this but that pending regular!sat ion through the diplomatic channel the flights should be treated as non-scheduled flights made at the request of the military authorities. As regards commercial flights we are asking the Iraqis to mate it clear that the time is not opportune to discuss post-war commercial services. 6 . I should be glad if you would take up these matters with the State Department. You should point out to them that we are willing and indeed anxious to collaborate closely with the Americans as regards American air services designed to assist the Allied war effort, but that these intentions will be obstructed if we are kept in the dark about them, that in so far as a commercial air service over Egypt is concerned we feel that war requirements are so extensive that there is in present circumstances no need nor scope for a service devoted to purely commercial objects. If, nevertheless,the United States Government wish to explore the matter further we hope that it may be discussed in the first place between the British and United States diplomatic* representatives in Cairo. As regards a post-war commercial service, we definitely feel that the present moment is not * opportune to discuss this,, and we have advised the Egyptian and Iraqi Governments accordingly., 7. You should add that it would facilitate matters in this connexion if, as we have frequently requested, Pan- American Airways could be induced to work through the diplomatic channel. This is surely_not too much to ask now that they have been militarised. 8 . Further you should state that continuance of the present position is not only likely to impair the smooth working of the war machine in the Middle East,but that it is bound to confirm suspicions that Pan-American Airways are taking advantage of the difficulties of an Ally in order to procure commercial advantages for themselves and that these suspicions, if they remain unchecked are likely to have unfortunate repercussions. 9 . I leave it to your discretion to make use in whatever way you think fit of the fears which the United States authorities have expressed of criticism of Pan-American Airways in Parliament (see your telegram under reference;.OUTWARD TELEGRAM [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be Your toloorans Nos. 859 and 893 [of March 17th and March 24th respectively: Pan-ivnerican Mr ways in the Middle Nastl.

The file therefore covers the militarisation of Pan American Airlines operations in the Middle East, and its absorption into the United States Army Air Force (USAAF).In addition, the file contains correspondence related to the use of the Southern Arabian Air Route by the United States Air Force: in particular, the use of aerodromes at Masirah and Salalah, as per a 1942 agreement with Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd, Sultan of Muscat and Oman: see folio 87 for a record of the negotiations. This includes discussion surrounding the post-war disposal of stone buildings built by the Americans at these sites.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (William Rupert Hay and Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (Cornelius James Pelly), HM Ambassador to the United States (Edward Wood, Viscount, later Earl of Halifax), HM Ambassador to Iraq (Sir Kinahan Cornwallis) the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East (Walter Guiness), officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office, and representatives of the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
