The ground^ on whieh the Grovernmcn t of India decided the Order was ultra vires, was that he was not a British subject &amp; as a protecetd foreigner could not be deported.lt was a point which is not very clear in the Order in Counc il &amp; in which I made a mistake. At the time I was not aware of the correspondance which had taken place,regarding this particular point, when the introduction of the Order in Councilmwas under consideration &amp; to which correspondance the Oovemment of India referred in pointing out that my deportatinn order was not legal. Cfe-f,, Recently Shaik Hamad ,on behalf of the relativies of J. lra *i vh9 th 9 r 1 oou:ld ^ *iy way to ^ — ;to return,and added that he felt aure he ted IhiHibIUi ehanged his attitude &amp; would not he lively to further Intrigue.

I do not think that It aakes .uoh dlfferenee whether he returns now or when the original order expires.I think It might be well to require hir to give the proposed assuranoes of good behariour.although past experience searedely leads one to plaoe «uoh faith in any suoh assuranees from Jasim Chirawi. At the same time I think it might be pointed out that ha is not a Shalk's subjeot. In view of tte faot that the matter deportation of foreigners is still.presumably.under eonsideratlon ▼ide your D.O.

A similar ease is that of Qosaibi.Please refer to your Ho iqJto 7orki.gii.ka things stand at present we equally oould not deport 4osaibi,skonld it beeome necessary^ ttia must tie our hands as regards any threats of sueh aetion to Bin 3aud. It is manifestlj unsatlsfaetoiy that Foreigners who enjoy our proteotlon hero .shoiad at the same time be in aposltlon to intrigue against us with impunity. From reports that have reached me through Arabs who hare bean in Bombay.lt would appear that 'aalm Chirawi has spent his tv e • jare in dissoDuta living t has cultivated the friendship of nndes rsv ables.

Your D.Oo of June 5^. As you are doubtless aw«it« the Bahrain Order in Council iwas * only introduced in 1919 ^nd cannot be considered to have been brought into use in its entity till the last two years, as it was essentiel on Political grounds to make the introduction gradual. I cannot find any records of deparrtations under th e tjrms of the Order in Council,which would act as precedents • As you say,a great many have been informally deported at difrerent times® I personally,reading section 8,took it to km * apply to foreigners who sre under British Control in Bahrain. To my mind the opening sentence of Para 8 ,is clear on the subject. It is in practice,such Foreigners who rre under our control who are the most likely to be subjects for deportation. In view of •the peculiar circumstances of Bahrain f particularly with reference to the Persian pretentions.Foreigners although injoying all the benifits of British protection,would if they wore totally imranxle from deportation &amp; so disposed,be able to make a tremendous N amount of difficulty. Whatever the true interpretation is,it is generally understood he re,both by thf iluler and the public, ! j that all persons under British protection,are liable to deportatioi should the circumstances warrant such extreme action.No objection I 3whatsoever has been taken to this interpretation,which the Ruler * considers he has accepted,in accepting the Order in Council. I venture to suggest that were it known that this interpretation is an incorrect one, ill-disposed persons of the Persian Community . -mrl others, would throw in their lot with Shaik Abdulla bin Basa 4 and oe capable o ' stirring up much trouble, Tr a ny case deportation is an extreme action only resorted to in extrema cases &amp; the recent two exanples \;a were obliged to make, are,it is hoped ,likely to obviate the necessity of repetition at any r te for a long period. In the particular case referred to, the in dividual had undertaken to leave Bahrain if called upon to do so, and the undertaking had been witnessed by the Ruler himself and the Heir-Apparent, and his mischief - making intrigues have been noted by successive Political Agents for years# • Yours sincerely•m Deportation of Foreigners under the Bahrein Order-in-Council. I enclose herewith an extract of a confidential demi- official letter from Foreign with regard to the deportation of Jasira Muhammad Al Chirawi. Colonel Trevor says that sir Percy Cox recommended that the right to deport foreigners should be entered in the Bahrein Order-in-Gouncil, but Govern ment of India declined to do so. Properly speaking we can^ therefore deport foreigners. The case of Jasim Muhammad Al Ghirav/i ? ho/ever, is rather different as he signed an agreement that he would leave the place. However, Colonel Trevor wants to know whether any foreip^ers have ever been deported under the Order before or not. Of course a great many have been informally deported, but I can't find whether-this order has been callexl in to use ■iExtract from confidential demi-official letter No. ir51R/r558-Ext., dated the 13th May 1922, from E.B. Howell Eecjr•, C.S.I*, O.I.E., Foreign and Political Department, Simla, to the Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel A.P. Trevor, C.S.I,C.I.E Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. f Please refer to your letter No.626, dated the 17th April 1922. It is observed that whereas under section 21(1) of the Bahrein Order-in-Council an order of deporuation is confined to British subjects, in the case Hi now reported the person deported is described as 'a pex-son 'Do wnom this ox-der applies'. From this it is understood that the Order-in- Council is interpreted as authorising the deportation of foreigners vide section 8.

The only person who could check! this is i^haik Abdulla and so they have long been partners.The fact that Abdulla is not to succedd his father will one day be s blow to Jasim.He is bitterly opposed to Shaik Hamad and interested in damaging hirft.He is always intriguing and spreading false reports about 3h.

Hamad. He has recently spent about Rs 30000 in Muharraq in an endeavour to stir people up to make all sorts of complaints.

He is constantly making trouble with the object of damaging Shaik Hamad in the hope that 3h. Abdulla will again get full control og affeirs.This he does for his own reasons,as he was Abdull T s partner in all their illicit gains. He is particularly anxious to create trouble are to get rid of the present customs Officials,who British Indian subjects .It is well known that he and Abdulla take a large annual sum from the customs at ^anameh as a bribe not to molest them.He is much opposed to the Manameh municipality and has Laoely beeii sncour- aging people to try to gat up a public petition against it.This is because formerly the ^hole manageii^ent of affairs in 5h. Abdull5.k r s h&amp;nds ^aid his own &amp; they made a great de^i of money out of it. Since the estaoxishnent of the 3aiudibh in Manamah a^i'^irs are managed oy .he committe and they caiinot/ control them for their owr. enus. He is not hiLiself however within the limits of T'lanumeh B^i^dieh, but lives in ruharra^ and has therefore no concern in the matter except for his own political ends. He himself brought a document to my father and myself and asked us to sign it complaining against the Municipality and the Agency and 3haik ^mad.We saw that it vas all intrigue and baseless ^ would h;:ve nothing to do with it.He has for some time been holding se cret meetings into which they tried to gradually introduce people with a view to opposing ever^hting that 3haik Hamad did to endeavour to get him into bad odour with the Agency, They tried to get me into it, but when they found I v^as not . appreciative they stopped approaching me on the subject. I could give you countless details of Jasim Chirawi f 3 intrigues but everybody in Bahrain except a few personal friends of his who are afriid of him, will give evidence as to his doings.

Hamad spares no pains to lessen the dignity and authority of the Agency.He has lately been particular ly busy in Muharra^ stirring people up to make complaints against the Ageency and the Baladieh.Particularly against the latter, which he considers curtails Abdulla T s activities, the affairs of the Town now being in the hands of the Baladieh Council. Before the Municipality was formed Abdulla did rs he pleased and oppressed everybody. He consented to the Baladieh being formed only because he was to be heddof it. Now that 3h . Hamad is head of it and allows the council to run its affairs without undue interference,Abdulla and ^asim Chirawi are bitterly opposed to it,but cannot do anything themselves and are therefore trying to stir up people against it. They cannot get anybody in Hanameh to support them t\fns we all approve of the ^aladieh so they tried to get the !'uharraq people to complain about it,who have iio claim in the matter at all.Jasim A1 Chirawi is the most dangerous intriguer Bahrain hJ■ s had in my lifetme and I am an old man.
