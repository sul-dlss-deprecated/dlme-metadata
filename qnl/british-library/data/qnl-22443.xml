The Journey had been considerably delayed in the Mediterrandan and the Hadrian flew through from cialilee on the 27th November 1932. rhe landing was made at night and was the first time that an aeroplane has landed at Bahrain in the darkness. Her appearence and the flare which she let off to light up the landing ground created a considerable impression on the on lookers. 2. bt colonel cordon Loch was met at the aerodrome by b^iaikh Salman,son of His Excellency shaikh Hamad,and also by blfaikh Rashid bin Muhammad al Khalifa,the father-in-law of shaikh isa» Shaikh Muhammad bin isa had come down to the aerodrome but as the aeroplane was late and he was suffering from cold,he asked the political Agent to express his regrets and went home. He kindly lent his car* for the journey from the aerodrome to the launch. The political Agent,captain c.(i.Prior,came to the aerodrome to meet Lit colonel 'viordon Loch and Mr.J .Russell of the Mesopotamia Persia corporation Limited,who is the Agent for imperial Airways was also there. &lt;1: 3. on the 29th iMovember 1932 His excellency shaikh Hamad came to call on Lt Colonel Gordon Loch at the Agency and it was arranged that he should call on His Excellency shaikh Sir Isa on the following morning and return shaikh Hamad's call at trie sametime as His excellency shaikh Hamad was going to Muharraq that day. 4. captain c»G.Prior left by the down mail on the 29th Noveiflber 1932 and Lt colonel Gordon Loch went with hinv in the 9 m yi ■■ j* motor cajf and saw him off from the customs Fier. 5. on the evening that Lt Colonel Gordon Loch arrived, that is to say roughly 8 t P,M ,Khan sahib yusif bin Ahmad Kanoo,C.T.S * It is not quite clear whether the car^a Buick, belongs to shaikh Muhammad or is really His Excellency shaikh isa f s car.M.B.E.,sent up word that he had come to call, it ^ was-^ of course , i a quite inconvenient moment but as ht uolonel Gordon L.och had known him well before,captain U.G.Prior asked him to come up for just a minute to shake hands, ne did not sit down but just shook hands and went away.i I as Your lijxcelleiic/,Ladies ana G-erxtlemen, I tiiank /ou with all my ueart for the warm welcome /ou have given us and for /our good wishes whicn i deepl/ appreciate. Aa /ou know,I wa$,for a short time,ten /ears ago,Political Agent in Bahrain ana I am ver/ pleased to re-visit the Island and to see m/ old friends again^ I am also ver/ lad to see In particular I am delighted to nave had the opport- unit/ of meeting once again our friend His Excell ency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali Al Khalifah. t- SALeiicxicj iuubi L'eb.riiij upon Inis- happy state of affairs. But the very success that xias attended i r our lixcellency T s Government brings its own problems: for good government attracts people from foreign countries to settle within its sphere,and increased population and new institutions mean increasea calls upon all departments of State. I am sure,however,tnat tne progress oi the past live /ears v/ill be continued and that a recovery of world prices,for which we all earnestly hope,will enable still further progress to be made,and also enable greater attention to oe given to places away from ..ianama ana Muharraij. I would especially inpress upon lour excellency the neea for agricultural develop- ment,as a means both oi obtainiug foodstuffs ana oi providing employment for many who now have but scanty opportunities of getting v/ork. itot only have great aavances been made in the internal aaministration,but Bahrain nas oeen brought into closer touch with the 'i»orld by the aevelopment of communications - a weekly steamer ?U'J ; Your Exc®llency,Ladies ana G-entlemen, I tnank you wi th all my Heart for the warm ./eicome you iiave given us and for your good v /ishes whicn I deeply a oreciate. Aa you lmow,I wa$,for a short time, ten years ^Agent in jahrain ano. I am very pleased to re-visit the Island and to see my old friends again.^ 1 am also very ;lad to see lor . aj sell tne signs, ot which I x^ave nearci so much,that Bahrain has progressed rapidly and has estaolishea nerseli as a model State among the administrations of the Persian Oulf. I congrat ulate 10ur Excellency most heartily upon this uappy Soate ol aliairs. But the very success tiiat xias attended ^.our Excellency's Government orings its own problems: for good government attracts people from foreign countries to settle within its sphere,and increased population and i-e\* instigations mean increased calls upon all departments of otate. I am sure,however,that tue progress ol the past five years will be continued and that a recovery of world prices,for which we all earnestly hope,will enable still further progress to be made,and also enable greater attention to be given to places away from ..anama ana iiiuharraq. I would especially inpress upon ^Jai Excellency tne need for agricultural develop ment's a means both of obtaining foodstuffs and 01 providing employment for many who now have but scanty opportunities of getting work. i\iot oiij-j have great advances oeen made in iiiterual administration,but ^irain has ueen brought into closer toucii with the Viorld by tne uevelopaent of communications - a weekly steamermail service,a telephone service aau last and most spectacular of the products of modern science, the weekly service of Imperial Airways. You have all seen how flying nas developed - at first there v/ere small machines and there was much discomfort and but few people uared to travel by air. Today you see the magnificient ana comfortable aeroplanes of Iiperial Airways bringing you within a few days of Europe and India. 3anrain is indeed fortunate in becoming an airport as well as a sea port. I have come to you for the first time as Political Resident in the Persian Grulf at a time when the thoughts of all are centred on the terrible failure of trade,which has been felt in Bahrain very hardly because the chief article of export,pearls,is a luxury and is,therefore, one of the first things to be affected when people nave less money to spend. I have watched with deep concern the f difficulties that have been felt in t^e pearl trade and among the divers owing to the heavy drop in the prices obtainable for pearls. You will remember that season There was a riot owing to the divers being discontented with the advances, naturally,looking back,we can all sympathise with poor men who find their small earnings growing less,but it is essential that law and order should be maintained and all must learn and remember that violence is not the correct method of obtaining the redress of grievances aM I am glad to that the Police xO^ce behaved admirably in trying circumstances and tiie trouble was prevented from spreading and causing widespread damage to life and propertyin the Town. This is ^ast history and,I trust, will not recur; and I am glad to find tnat the position has improved as there lias been in the last few months an increase of some 20^ in the prices of pearls at Bahrain and that there seem to be signs of an improvement in tne European and Indian markets. This should help both the traders and the divers to pass through the present nard times. Some improvement seems moreover,to be taking place in the date market and in other directions. As you all know,prospecting for oil has for sometime past been carried on by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and oil has been found,but it is too early as yet to form an opinion as to whether a profitable commercial field can be developed. Tne next few months should make it possible to form an opinion on tne subject,and, in the meantime,though it is possible that tne financial position of Bahrain will be improved b r the development of an oil field,yet it would be unwise to count upon it. These improvements in the pearl and aate markets,and the possibility of the development of an oil industry are undoubtedly hopeful si^ns: but the ship of State is not yet out of tne storm ■ all that we can say is t^at there are slight siggs of the adverse weather abating. The budget position is giving cause for very serious anxiety,the revenue is less than last year and even after drastic curtailment of expenditure it is likely that the State will have to take money from the .j' 111 i yr I in jrder to meet its current expenditure. This cannot go on for long and,unless tnere is a marked rise of prices in the markets* in txie next two months it will be necessary to consider even more rigid curtailment of expenaitort t.ian lias been carried out in the ^ast. I am sure that lour excellency will do all that is possible to ensure that expenditure is brought down to a level which is covered by the revenues. iliere are two other matters on which I should like to touch. One important airection in which,I under stand, pub lie opinion is beginning to aeiiiana a cnange is the adi amstraifion of In tx^e past unfortunately,it aas been only too often, the case that the property of widows and orphans has been made away with,even by ,those entrusted with their care. I know tnat this matter is 'Fl under tne active consideration, of lour excellency' Government and I feel assured tnat this state of affairs will no longer be allowed to continue. But in tiiis kina of matter adverniaent alone can do little; there must be a sound pVblic opinion to help them,and I hope that the leading men among you will assist tne Government of B^irain in L.eir efforts jo safeguard c the property of \hose unable to look after tneir own interests. xhere is another matter to whicn I shoula likt to refer. In recent years it has been found tnat water can be obtained easily from artesian wells. It is no doubt an excellent thing that there shoulc be a copious supply of fresh water for all,but I understand t^xat the widespread use of artesian wells in ^anrain is likely to give rise to two clangers against which it is necessary that we should be on our guard. In the first place, allowiag water to run unchecked from these artesiaj wells loweJJJthe head of water and it may be/ tuat in /ears to come shall find toat we can no longer enjoy tne benefit of an artesian water supply because we sixall have dissipated tiie water at a greater rate than it collects unaergrouna. In t^e secona place,the presence of water on the surface of the land nas caused an increase in malaria and I fear that unless care is sKSKr exercised the abundance of water may prove to bring a serious danger to trie public-health in the form of malarial fever. I believe tnat a proclamation has already issueu ordering that persons who wish to make artesian wells must obtain permission ana I think tiiat tne Government of iahrain would be wise to exercise a strict control,both in granting permission to bore fresh water wells and also in checking any unaue waste from those wells which are already in existence. Before I end my speech I have the pleasant task,and I am sure that I speak for all of you as well as myself,of congratulating Khan Eanadur Abdul Rahman Ziyani on his weil deserved honour. It gives me great pleasure to see him here^his afternoon and to have the opportunity of offering him my congratulations. Finally,! thank Your excellency ana you, Laaies and G-entlemen,once again for the welcome which you have given me ana I would express my most sincere hope tnat unaer lour excellency's government Bahrain may see a continuance of progress and a return of prosperity, Be assured that I will do all t. A at lies in my power to help four excellency achieve tnose objects.Captain Prior has iust left Baiirain after txiree and a half years during which he has done much to iielp Jour Excellency and lour excellences officers in carrying through iwproveuents in tiie administration. I am sorry tuat he is not present for me to bid him G-od-speed. I neea naraly introduce your new Political Agent,eiifiut Colonel Loch, i^ot only has he been here before himself as Political Agent but one of his family,Captain Loph R,h'.,ia&amp;de the first agreement between the British Government and lour Excellency T s ancestors ! no less txian 113 years ago. \G .T.CODE.
