'From The Fe si dene / Agent, Sliargali. To Tlie Resident, Busliire. A. G. I have the honour to state that I sent the present (viz one gold watch and chain, one binocular, and 4 yards broads- cloth^ along vvith the letter I received rrom you,through an special man,to the Sheikh of Ajman, out the Sheikh in the presence of tnose who were present there returned the present and .said it was a joke. The nobles that were present there advised the Sheikh not to return it as it would be an act of indignation to the sender of the present but he did not follow their advice and told them that- he had in a similar way not accepted the present sent to him last year so he would not accept this /ear too. I beg to state that norue of the Sheikhs ofi the Oman Coast ■ who have entered into an agreement with the British Grovern- ment have ever behaved themselves in the way as the Sheikh of Ajman did now in returning the present sent to him. Such action was not even done by his ancestors. All the late and present Sheikhs were and are pleased by receiving such presents(whether more or less y and consider it an honour. I think this action of the Sheikh of Ajman in returning the present sent to him is an act of therefore he is not worthy of being respected as this present was an honour to him and no one would have,if given,refused it un less lie would have been a mean man. The present is with me and awaiting your instructions as to its disposal. o-ct y / .,7^, M.A.I:. _ f \ 10/11/11 o-tnv.c eo-'^ (ht ♦ ■■. ■ ■i ■ i .* ■ .Talegram, Prom - Bill, Bushira.

I am sending by this mail precis of recent pro ceedings of Shei-kh of Ajman which can only be adequately dealt with by a personal visit from a British Officer preferably, of course, yourself. Chief points are:- * (!)• His repeated refusal of annual present. (2), Public refusal to receive letters from Residency Agent on three occasions. (3). Alleged participation with Bin Loota family in intrigues which have produced a warning to Residency Agent from Sheikh of Um-el-iiowein that his life is in danger. I let you know the above facts by telegraph in case you may find them useful in deciding your plans. Bill,OFFICE NOTF. To Shaikh of Ajman. a .u • I have recently received several reports from Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif respecting certain proceed ings of yours in respect of his communications with ^ou which have caused me great surprise, I am report- ing the mattery to the Resident who will return in a few days from India and will doubtless examine very closely into your affairs. My only object in writing is to warn you in your own interests to be very care ful that nothing undesirable should happen on your side before the Residents return. You should remember that the eyes of the lireat Cjovernment are always upon r ycur ooun 1j(i e«• (sd) J.H.tflll, r.a.kq*tdent« (±n the absence of r.n.). S 741—11,000-ir-o^9^ After calling at 3hargah, receiving a visit from Sheixh Sagar and taking Residency Agent on .board, I proceeded to Ajman on February and the SHeikh caiae on board as usual, I taxed him ./ith his general misconduct, his rejection of Residency presents, his refusal to receive Residency Agent's Official letters or reply to his communications, and his encouragement to runaway debtors from Debai. Ha replied that he did not mean any offence by returning the presents, and as regards the rest endeavoured to launch out into an incolierent exposition of his o^n claims. r Ai e was informed, however, that 1 could enter Into no claims of his until he had given adequate satisfaction for his insulting behaviour to the Re sidency Agent and myself, and I required him to make a full apology and pay a fine. I originally placed the fine at 5,000/- with hope of reduction if his attitude in regard to business matters ./hich I had to discuss with him proved satisfactory. At this point bad weather came on-and we had to go to Abu ilusa for shelter. Eventually he be came tractable; gave /ritten apology - attached - and paid fine, whicn ./as finally fixed at 2,000/- in view of the fact that he made a satisfactory reconciliation with the Residency Agent and settlea up or came to an understanding re outstanding cases. In the course of our discussions he was strict^ % warned against allowing the Bin Loota^ (who are v . being dealt with separately) to make mischief bet ween him and the Agency and the •jheikh of Debai.

I bep to represent to Your Honour that a dispute took place between the Shaikh of Ajman and the Bin Luta family of British subjects who resides at that town, and that seeing that the d dispute was increasing between them, i I went to the Shaikh of Ajman and made peace between him and the Bin Luta family, remoring the annoyance which existed betwenn them. ■ x x * v •tj- z&lt;kl.

July in which you niention that you have been so fortunate as to arrange the dispute which.existed between the Shaikh of AJman and the Bin Luta family. This was what was expected of your conciliatory disposition and I congratulate you on the good result^/ 7 I was also much pleased to hear^that Shaikh Rashid of Unnrx-ul-Qaiwain has come to meet you at Zora and that he has expressed to 7 /ou his regret and repentance for what has been done by him in the past and that you have received his solemn pledges that he will listen to the advise of myself which will, as he says, I hope always be nothing more than the advice of the exalted and Imperial Govern ment . You can tell the Shaikh now that it was a matter of deep regret to myself that my first appearance at his town should have been in the guise of one who punishes and that I most sincerely trust from the reports which I have received from you of his present reasonable attitude that a persory((al friendship between us will commence from this moment and ever increase to the benefit of us both.

As the mail steamer would take a long time to come, I have reported this by telegraph if kjl- , *1 Poom - The Residsncy Agent, Sfaargah To - The Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire No.'506 dated 29th June 1920. A. C. ' , X With reference to my telegram No.473 dated 21st June 1920 &gt; on the subject of the occurrence at Ajman, I beg to state the circumstances under which the Hireh men entered the Shaikh's house at Ajman. A Bedouin namsd Mobarak ben Sabt killed a 1«38 (Maroh-fipril 192») in the Shargah territory. The latter mas a Fedawi of Shaikh Khaled bs Ahmad. The murderer took rSfuge with Sh.. flomaid ben Abdul Aziz Chief of Ajman. The murdered man's relatives went to the said Shaikh and demanded Mobarak. Sh. Homaid refused to ttoijl ffi obari:k continued to remain with thj( Shaikh.'^ (Dn the night of 27th Ramazan 1338 (15-6-20) Mobarak took with himself Abdur Rahman ben Muhammad, a Shaikh of the Bu—Shanyss, and some other men inside the house of the Chief of Ajman* The door keeper did not prevent them because he knew Mobarak.^ In the follow ing morning Mobarak was kiiisixiy shot dead by th5&lt; people' o^ Aj man. ^ On the same night Shaikh Khaled ben Ahmad sent his brother Sh. Hashed and Abdollah to me three times requesting me to xiiH proceed to Ajman to compose the affray. I made excuses til srsj ah proceed-ed there. As he was approaching Ajman, he found tki* it impossible to enter the town on account of the rifle shots. So he remained outside. The British subjects residing at Ajman, A1 ben butah and Bunnias, and the Persian subjects, sent a message to me reque » ing protection for their lives and property. 0 haikh Homaid wrot &gt;/72. me a- letter dated 27th Ramazan by the hand of Haji Ahmad ben Lutah, which I beg to forward hsrewith for your information, requesting me to go thecrs because he saw his life endangered by the Shargah men (who hai&lt; taken the fort). i n addition to this shaikh Whaled sent his brother, Abddllah, from Ajman to me requesting me to 00 there.So in view, firstly, of protecting the Government and forei^ subjects, and in deference to the appeals of Shaikh Whaled and Shaikh Homaid, I proceeded to Ajman by sea. I saw the said subjects were afraid on account of the shooting in the town between the people of ^jman and those in possession of the fort. The Shaikh of Ajman and family were in the house their night gorns. I enquired from Sh. Homaid as to who occupied the Govert. house v and he replied Abdur Rahma.n ben Muhammad of A1 Bu Shames who is related to Qawasem. I sent a message to th® said Abdur Rahman to stop firing on the tftwn and let me know f}hi;t ,right he had ta on Shaikh Homaid and for taking his Government house. I your information. I xratg him a reply on the 2Sth Ramazan giving him counsel and advice to leave the Government house o c £ 117 Ajman. He sent me a reply which I enclose herein.. In that he says thstt he accepts my ad-vice but doe(s not agree to leave the house on the assuraice of the ^haikhs mentioned by me (i.e. ■ Khaled and Homaid), but asked for safe conduct by British Government for his own life and property and those of his companions. I informed Shaikh Khaled and Homaid of l:bdur Rahman s reply to me. Both of them acceded to Abdur Rahman's demands whereupon I obtained assurances from Sh. Homaid that Abdur Rahman and his companions would be secure at his hand^ and at the hands of his subjects and that he would not try to harm them. Afterfiards I objltained the assurances of Shaikh Khaled in the presence of respectable persons that Abdur Rahman and his companions would fas sxfxx receive no harm from him and his brothers and others. Afert taking the words of the 2 Shaikhs I wrote to Abdur Rahman saying that he lallixfes safe. , * f7? I enclose a copy of my letter. In the afternoon I and Shaikh Khaled went towards the fort, and I gave verbal assurances to Abdur Rahman and brought hiai aiix and his friends out of the house, which was handed to Shaikh Homaid. I and Shaikh Khaled took Abdur Rahman and his friends to my jolly boat and iaak of A1 Ben Lutah without any clothesj their females were inih-i brought them to Shargah. I lodged tfeea in the Agency for a feis days so thttt th»y might feel secure and th3(n go to ixx tbsir homes. On 4th Shasnal (21-8-20) I received a from Shaikh Homaid stating that ornaments and rifl«s had been carried aray from his house. His letter is anclosed. I asked Abdur Rahman to returnati the ornaments, but he and his friends said that they had not taken af.ay any ornaments, but that they did not know whether any thin^ had been aarried off by the man who accompanied them and ran away afterwards and was at Debai then. I sent for the£ and he came. I told him that he must return the Ornaments which he did. I enclose a list of them. I obtained 4 rifles After obtaining the ornaments I sent them to Shaikh Homaid through my uncle, Haji Yusef ben Abdollah. When the latter reached thare the Shsikh began making unbecoming- representations in return the favour I had done him,when he was deprived of the chiefship of Ajman and his property was in the hands of the occupiers of thjc house. He threatened to kill the men *ho were in ssfsgs the Ms ncy, house, namely Abdur Rahman and his friends. My uncle, having- heard th3 .se things, handed the rifles and orniiments which were returned to me. I was astonished at the representations of 3h.- Homaid in return for th3&lt; Agency's favour in handing back to him the town of Ajman. Sxi Sxcept for the high Government's favour, the Shaikh of Ajman jfould be considered a subject now in the towns of the Arab Coast. But he does not recognise kindness and favour. Abdur Rahman and his friends are indebted to British subjects on account of diving business and 1 asked Shaikh Khaled that they might make preparations foif their boats to ptroceed for diving to pay/ thsir debts. He has violated the undertaking he gavs me. His letter to me is ©nclosed.. He asks that they should leave the Agency and go and reside, in any town thsiy want. I visited the said Shwikh and ssxxiissi reminded him of his undertaking. I obtained a grace of ten dctys duringl7 l which they should aaka pxpa jirepars their boats for diving. &gt;/r Shaikh Khaleda ben Ahmad s letter to your Honour is enclosed herewith,from which you will see that he has violated his agreement as a consideration for Shaikh Homaid who is his ally.. The Shaikh of Ajman has no character and always intrigues. He killed a man at Debai some years ago for which the Shaikh of Debai sent an expedition against Ajman. If you think advisable you may send him a stro^ng letter in this connection, and also write to Sh. Khaled advising them to adhere to the undertaking they gave me about th3&lt; lives and property of Abdur Salamsn and his friends^ and to give me all (?) if he does not want th®m to reside at Hireh. Kindly send me such instructions -as you think fit in regard to the ornaments.

Shargah Dated Ramazan (June 19^©)., A.C. Your letter has been reoeived and its contents were under stood. You asked how we marched on the fort of Ajman and occupied it, I beg to state that we did not intend to do a thing in which we had no share. This fort has been the property of my grandfathers since former times and Shaikh Homaid^ grandfathers treacherously attacked my ancestors, killed 250 men, excluding women,.and occupied this fort and their abbetor and helper in this act was Shaikh S^qar ben Sultan. Now I have not done anything in occupying the fort. aa regards the British subjects they will not be harmed.|S ' ' From - The Resids-ncy Agent, Shargah To - Abdur Rahman ben Muhammad Shamesi Dated 23th Ramazan 1338.(16-6-20). &amp; r* : m { have received your letter in which you said that you intended to occupy the Chief's house because you had a right to do so in thtit Ajman /ras yours since former times and that it was tceacherously taken from your ancestors after much blood shed due to Saqar ben Khaled's assistance with Homaid ben Abdul Aziz's forefaifhers. What you say took-place years ago, and Shaikh flomaid's father and grandfather have been ruling over Ajman for b long time before me and you.' It is obvious that in former times * &gt; . r' j A1 Bu Shames and Naeem have had fightings with Ajman, but the Bu Shames have not had anything at Ajman^since a long time,and these senseless talks are of no avail to you. It is desirable for you, now that you have time, to leave the house, and if you like to get safe conduct from Shaikh Sasce^oen Maktum or Rashed ften Ahmad, you can let me know and I will summon either of them you desire. You should accept my advice because I desire your safety. The people of Ajman do not want you to be their Shaikh, and Shaikdom aa without the consent of the community cannot last; If yoydo not accept iiiy advice you will perish in the house. Firstly you will not get help,and food from all sides will bs stopped. Secondly, as you know, there are in Ajman British and Persian subjects and the British aovernment will hold you responsible for all loss they may sustain,especially if one of them is killed,then you will find yourself in a great trouble. I hope you will not opposa my and agree xiik to my a opinion. Send me a reply. U? v-m Frqin- Abdur Rahman ben Muhammad To - Isa ben Abdul Latif, R*A., Shargah Dated Ramazan 1338 (=June 19S0), A.C. I received your letter and its contents were under stood. You referred to the people of Ajman stating that they do not want me and would not submit to me. You should know that I occupied this house because I knew that I could keep it because I have tribesmen and they only expect a hint from me to come. But when you.came to Ajman I abandoned my intention as we fear that the High Government may become angry with us. But the Government subjects and the Persians were not molested by us in any way and you can ask them whether any shots were fired at them. We are not ignorant of affairs and know what is good and bad. Moreover we did not injumthe inhabitants 6f Ajman in any way. Whatever./we did in the fort was for our h defence. You said that we^like, you could call the Shaikhs to come to bring us out of the fort under their auspices, we do not agree to this-and you should not think that we will lea^e the fort on the assurances of the Shaikhs. If we are forced we will leave on receiving the assurances of the High Government and you should come to the fort personally so that we may hear from you verbally./ 7/ Protfl - The Residensy Agent, Shargah To - Abdur Rahman Dated 1st Shanwal 1333 (13-3-20)» a f /uo-ilax I have received yonr letter and understood :/ou wrote. As you know, I always try for reconoiliat ion and composing of quarrels between the Shaikhs and others, because it is imperitiv^ on us to endeavour for the tranquility of the Arab Coast so that the people should be at peace because they are indebted to British subjects fax on account of diving. I know you aee a sensible and wise man, and will not insist on a thing which mil involve you in^losses on account of British and foreign subjects. The subjects are grateful to you since tkxy no' harm was done to them by you through the firing in the town. No shot reached the A1 Ben Lutah locality. This is my opinion of you. -fryvw You wrote th4rt you would not come down ^the house on the safe conduct to be given by the Shaikhs named by me, and request ed for my safe conduct. I have summoned Shaikh Khaled ben Ahmad and 3h. Homaid and obtained undertakings and assurances from them about your lives and prop3 &lt;rty that no danger will befall you from them. On the strength of the two Shaikhs^I assure you that nothing unsatisfactory will befall you. Herewith my man will come to you, and you should leave the horses so thart they may be fed.

I beg to state that an incident took place on our side which I think desirable to report to yau in view of our alliance.;, It is this. Some asa of my subjects residing at my town, Hireh, were deceived by Satan to go and occupy the house of the Chief of Ajman. Suddenly three hours ks after dark on the night of 27th Ramazan 8 men went there when the Chief was praying in the mosque, and occupied the house. There was firing between them, and Tfhen I heard it I went there &gt;with my companions in odder to bring them out of the house. This I could not do except by fighting them. Fighting lasted four days during which 5 men from Ajman were killed and 3 men were wounded. On the side of the mischief makers one ma;n was killed who was the ring leader and guide. When ks. they came to the e«wi of their tetter and/^te tightly pressed by fighting, they asked for safe conduct to leave the house. Your Agent, Isa ben Abdul Qatif,. accompanied me and used gootl offices so far as possible. They said that they would come out on the safe conduct of myself and that of the British Government. I gave them safe conduct for the safety of (their) lives and property; so did your agent. They came down and after the Shaikh of Ajman went to his house we returned with the mischief makers, and your agent gave them lodging at his house till they collect their men and property and go anywhere ^ i n they like except /V my territory Ssak which they are forbidden. This is what took place. I am prepared to carry out your orders.

A.C. V I beg to inform you tbout &amp;n incident which wes brought about by those mischiefm^kers who htd no ri^ht to do it.

But they did not do this End this mischief lested 4 days, on the 5th dEy, 1st h ewwe1 , they were tightly pressed End wished to come down End asked for sEfe conduct by is e ben Abdul LEtif, the Government Agent. They came down on IsE f s sEfe conduct tnd the mischiefmakers Ere with the Agent now.

The Sheikh of Shergeh repeatedly insisted on my expelling /bdur Pahmen and his perty from the /gency, while the Shaikh of I jmen hes been trying by me^n intrigues to ceuse en improper trouble for i.bdur Rahmen in the /gency. This is the Sheikh of /jmen's recompense for the /gency's good turn. He hes forgotten the /gency f s fevour to him when he was dispossessed of his Government House and his belongings. In order to seve you any trouble which ney occur if /bdur Rehman is hermed while et the /gency, I instructed him and his men to go to eny town they went, on 8rd July they went towards Res-ol-Kheimeh leaving their b 0 its end families at Hirah where they thought they would be safe.

If he is still on the Coast when this reaches you please teil hiri from me that the way to earn the Approval of the High Government is not to write letters in that strain when written to&gt; but to act in a friendly manner, i.e. settle cases of British subjects and others when asked to do so by British representatives and to behave in a friendly manner generally to the representatives and subjects of the High Government. is regards his prei/ftens ions to \jman, on what grounds does he claim the place? being the heir of the Shaikh?

I bee to state that when Abdor Rahman and his friends wese in the fort at Ajman Shaikhs Khaied and Homaid could not expel them from the fort. The two Shaikhs appealed to me to expel Abdor Rahman and his friends from the fort. Therefore I used my good cf-fiees by making strong representations to'Abdor Rahman and his party for 2 days and they agreed to leave the fort with the assurance of the High Imperial Government as regards their -oro^erty and that they should live in their Tiom^s at Hireh. Thereupon I consilted Shaikhs Khalod and Hbmaid about-Abdor Rahman's proposal which they accepted' The Shaikhs made no conditions but accepted the conditions.of Abdor nahman and his party, and gave me assurances about this in the presence of a number of the notables of.Shargah and Ajman. Then I gave assurance and quarter to Abdor Rahman and his narty relying on || ^assurances of the two Shaikhs. 'hen I brought out Abdor Rahman and his narty wilh t he agree m^nt of Shaikh hal^d and took them to the jolly boat, the said Shaikh reoiiPst^d me in a ^riendlv -ray that Abdor Rahman and his ' ^arty might stay in the Agency for four days in order that every thing might become quiet and it might become clear that tJiR Abdor Rahman's departure vas on the assurance of the Government. I agreell to Shaikh I haled's suggestion about Abdor Rahman and his narty remaining in the Agency for the said period and then -oroeeed to their homes at Ilireh.But when Shaikh Homaid took rest in his fort after that had happened to him, he forgot the goodness and kindness ani opened his. ears to the sayings of tale bearers. He wro/te to Gh-iikh Khaled that if Abdor Rahman and his party go to their homes at Hireh, they would not keep on friendly teris with him. Shaikh 7r hal-d therefore changed his mind and began Dressing me to send. away Abdor Rahman and his party. The two Shaikhs made'secret the intrigues to take/action which T reported in my letters ITos.505 7 541 dated r^th June and 12th July /a The minds of Shaikhs, Homaid and Khaled became clear after ■ ■ ■ s. ■ .

But I understand that Shaikh Goltan ben Muhammad, Chief of Earalri 'as the author of the disagreement between Khaled ben Ahmad and Homaid and It was through his teachings that the two Shaikhs attempted to break their agreement and showed unsatisfactory attitudes.

A.C. . ^ With reference to nj letter No.761 dated 28th October 1920 regarding the pretensions of the Shaikh of Braimi to \jman, I beg to state that according to the enquiries made hy me from well informed persons, the Shaikh of Barimi has no title to \jman; but he and the Shaikh of \1man are from the same tribe viz. Na'aim and have family relations on their great grandfathers 1 line, as described by m e here under. Homaid is the son of \bdul \ziz son of Homaid son of Rashed son of Homaid son of Rashed. of Soltan son/Mohamnad is the son of \li son of Hunood son of K ham is son of Rasheds Honaid and I'hanis are brothers. ?he grandfathers of the (present) Shaikh of Braini did not rule over Braiai which was governed hy a tribe called Baariyyeh. The first Shaikh of Unan, Horn id ben Hashed V, had his government at a village of Braimi called \s-arah. The Baariyyeh rule being weakened at Braimi, Horaaid b en Khaais 17 beo^ine the Shaikh of Braini with the assistance of his uncle Ilonaid ben Rashed. On the death of Honud, \ii ben Horaud III boopne the Shaikh of Braini while Honaid ben Rashed was at \s-arah. \fter a short tine some dispute occurred between Ul, the Shaikh of Braini, and his' uncle, Honaid ben Rashed. The latter left \s-arah to avoid any bloodshed between then and cane to tki Shaikh Soltan ben oiqar \1-Qaseni of Shargah who lodged Eonaid ben Rashed at the village of Hirah, a dependency of Shargah. \t that tine the Shaikhs of \jnan were from the U-Bushanss tribe to which belongs ibdur Rahman ben Mohannad who occupied the fort of Ijman at the end of Ranazan 1333 (May-June lf&gt;20). l T omaidm Honaid ^en Rashed then went from Hirah to the ••Bus ha me e \t \jnan. It is stated that Homaid was an able nan and, on account of his a Ml ity^ became the Shaikh of \jnan and expelled the \1-Bushanes from there. There were several fights between M-Bushanes and Homaid ben nashed for \ Iman, but the former have not been able up to now to get possession of Vjman on account of Soltan ben Saqar's help to the said Homa id. Uy enquiries show that none of the Shaikhs of Braimi ruled over \jman nor did any Shaikh of \jman rule over Braimi; the latter were only at \s-arah formerly. I be^y to state that the man more entitled to the Shaikh- dom of \jnan, after the present Shaikh, is either his cousin, named Naser ben Rashed ben Homaid who was blinded by fire by his uncle. Shaikh \bdul Uiz ben Hom^id, the late Chief of \jman in the year 1320 * 1902 for the purpose of getting the Chieftainship of \jman, or the son of the present Shaikh, named Rashed ben Homaid, who is still boy. The Shaikh of Braimi thinks that if anything happens to the present Shaikh of \jman there is no one to become the Shaikh of \ jman that as Naser ben Rashed is a Mind man and as the Shaikh's son is a boy, the IVl-Bushames will, perhaps, get the Chieftainship of 4jman. The Shaikhs of the Coast do not like that the Shaikh of Bra imi rule on \jman as tney consider that he has acted most tyrannically and on account of his tyrannical rule many men of the Coast have lost their properties in Braimi. His rule over the people- is unjust.From- The Residency \geru, Shargah To - Colonel Trevor, Resident, Bushire . No.999 Dated 28th Deoembep 19^0« receiyed Snd January Iff!!.

In view of fact that two of H.ii,Ships were present, I thought that it woulr! stultify us if I replied that nothing; would happen but that I should report his recalcitrant behaviour to Government, So,after consulting Senior Naval Officer I informed Sheilrh that if he did not pay fine within two hours (i,e, by 6,p.m.) two watch tow63r8 outside and to South-Tiest of town wpuld be knocked down in succession. Sheikh made no attempt to pay and Cycla'ien according ly knocked down one Tower and badly wrecked the'other. At Sheikh sent off and made submission and paid fine. As far as could be ascertained there w re no casualties. Report follows by post. ■ c» ; - - • ; ' j - r-.v m s /') i„ J .

Xr0vor,O.S,I,,O,I.E. # Political nesidant in the Parsian uulf. To Tha H^'ble Mr. Dany'a da S,Bray,C.I.E. f O.B.E., foreign Secretary to tha uovermaent of indi« In tha foreign and Political Depftrtmant, S I M L A« Sir, In amplification of my talerram HQ. 7^5 dated 12th May lv21, I have tha honour to subrait t] 3 following report about my proceedings at Ajraan. * Jt^-r v 8, After the conclusion of / business at Sharn;ah, described in my letter No, dated ISth May, I proceeded in H.M.S. f, Oycla^len ,, accompanied by l, Orocus ,, to Ajman arriving there about noon on tha 9th Hay, with the object of remonstrating with or possibly punishing the Shaikh of that place. Shaikh Humaid bin Abdul Aziz, for hie misconduct. In 1911 and 1913 this Shaikh was very troublesome and obstinate and had to ba fined by Sir P, Cox, Again in 1918 !!r. Bill was obliged to fine him^ and recently he has been most obstinate and unreasonable. When I was on the Trucial uoast last December my t attef£lon was drawn to the fact that Shaikh Humaid had recen £ ly torn up a manumission certificate granted by tha Kesidency in 1917, and had tried to ra-enslave the holder. This of course is a grave offence, as if once our manu mission certificates are disregarded and destroyed no slave freed m-2- in ^ freed by us will be safe. The tearing up of this certificate was thus the first of the present offences coraraitted by the i Shaikh, 4, As I wished to hear what the Shaikh had to say about the natter I went to Ajman, in n.I.M.S, ,, Lawrence ,, which was flying the Jiesident's flag. Shaikh Humaid however did not visit the ship although I waited for sometime and the ship went quite close in shore at higji water, and as^iad not much time Z left without seeing him. It is a rule well-known to all the Shaikhs of the Trucial ooast, and a custom which has been in force for very many years that whenever the 'Lawrence 11 or one of H.H. Ships flying the Hesident's Flag anchors off a Trucial ooast port the shaikh has to go off at once to the ship. Shaikh Humaid^ failure to visit the 'Lawrence' was thus his second offence, June 1980 tihu- uuaut Jhaikh Humaid became involved in trouble with one Abdur Hahman of Hairah, the next tort to the South of Ajman, In fact on the night of the 15th June 1980 when Shaikh Humaid and most of his men were out Abdur Hahman and some others seized the Ajman ^ort and the Shaikh could not dislodge him. After a time Shaikh Humaid asked the Residency Agent at shargah to come and mediate. Khan Sahib Isa bin Abdul Latif accordingly went to Ajman and managed to get Abdur Hahman to evacuate the Fort on a safe conduct. 6. Abdur Kahraan in Indebted to the extent of over ks. 80,000/- to urltiah Uubjeots, and the only hope of recovering this money is that he should be able to ply his business of pearling. At first he went to Bahrain but oould not make a livelihood there being regarded as an interloper, and so he was allowed to oome back to his village in order to be able to make enough to satisfy his creditors with annual instal ments in repayment of their claims. 7. The iJhaikh of A ,Jman and the ahaikh of Shargah who is-s- v)] rw is In a vague way a sort of overlord of Ajman at first objected to iibdur Rahnan*3 retum^and shortly after ray visit to the Trucial Coast took up arms against him in January 1981 The Senior Jfaval Officer, captain Pearson O.M.d. it.If., whose ship ti.M.G, 'Triad - was not far off was asked to go and watoh the interests of British subjects, and if possible mediate. Captain Pearson made an arrangement which was acceptable to the Shaikh of Shargah and Abdur italiman, but the Shaikh of Ajman refused to go on board the 'Triad* 1 last January,when invited to do so, to state his case. This was very discourteous on his part ©specially as the other parties went off], and may be regarded as a third ofi'ence. 8. Some time later I learnt from a letter from Bin Saud to the political Agent at Bahrain that Shaikh Humaid had appealed to Bin Saud about his dispute with Abdur Kahman. I may mention that before ray visit to Ajman I had already instructed the Political Agent, Bahrain to give Bin Saud the facts of the case, and remind him that by of his Treaty with iireat Britain he has agreed not to interfere in matters on the xrucial ooast. Shaikh Humaid♦s action in referring to ain Saud is highly obiBctionable. fi. It was therefore with a view to dealing with these cases that I visited Ajman on 9th May, On arrival I sent the Residency Agent ashore to request the Shaikh to come off and see me. Shaikh Humaid turned up at about 3.15, He assumed a moat truoulant and defiant attitude, in fact during my 17 years experience of these parts I have not yet corae across a Uhaikh or Khan who adopted so insolent a deraeanour. I found that a young man whom he had sent to Mejd with a letter to Bin Saud had recently returned wltth a reply. The young man had been received by the Amir and given a sword, and both he and the Shaikh were Inordinately puffed up in oonsequenoe. The Shaikh, after he had been in the oabin a few minlites, called out for the young man who came in4. &amp; in without any invitation from mo; I did not know who he was and soon after I discovered had to request him to withdraw as he seemed to excite (and Incite) the Shaikh to more truculent and violent talk. .0. Th^ Jhaikh denied having torn up the manumission Certl^ifate, but we have the evidence of the slave, and of hi^wife who afterwards picked uv&gt; th© pieces and brought them to the Residency Af^ent. Apart from this the Shaikh told so many Lies in ranid succession about the matter that, I came to the conclusion that no reliance whatever could be placed on his statements, 11. At first I thought of fining him kb .1000/- for tearing up the ^inuniijBlon certificate and ks . IOOA on each occasion for not visiting tne ^bawrence 1 ' and 'Triad', but I finally decided to fine him a round sum of ks. IOOO /- for the lot. I accordingly informed him of my decision, and he was most defiant practically asking what would happen if he did not pay. IS. As at this stage the Shaikh adjoined to say his afternaon prayer I took the opportunity of consulting the Senior jEfaval Officer, considering that as two of His Majesty's Ships were present it would be too absurd to leave without doing anything if the Shaikh refused to pay, and merely inform the latter that his recalcitrancy would be reported to Oovemment. 15. The senior Haval Officer and I agreed that the best thing would be to tell the Shaikh that If he did not pay within two hours His Majesty's Ships would destroy 8 watch towers to the S.W. of the Town in succession. I accordingly told the Shaikh this and he left the ship in a defiant mood telling Khan Sahib Abdur Rezzak, the Residency Arabic Munshi, as he left that it would be the worse for us if we destroyed the Towers. I told the Hunshi to tell him that if he decided not to pay he had better tell any body in the neighbourhood of the Tower to leave. Bei^ nightjwatch towers theyt-k/ 2^ iw they are not actually inhabited during the day. 14. By six o'oloolc there was no sign of the Shaikh paying so H.M,S. ,, Oyolamen n was warped round so as to get her with broadside on to the shore, and deliberate fire bx the fore castle 4 inch gun was opened on the Tower furthest from the Town. After firing a few rounds the Tower fell and was totally demolished, and a pause was made in the firing. There was no sign of any boat coming off so firing was resumed at the 52nd Tower. A few rounds knocked the front part of this off, and left the back half standing as sort of archj another round or two would have demolished it« as it was then getting dark, and moreover the ship had swung a little and the gun could no longer be trained on the tower firing was stopped. 15. At about 9 o # clock the Shaikh sent off an emissary saying that he was obedient to the orders of government and would do whatever was required. I asked the emissary if he had brought the ws.1000/- fine and he said no, but would go ana fetch it. Me did so and returned with it in cash at about 11 p.m.. I then told him that ordinarily I should have required the Shaikh to come off and make his apology himself but as Ramzan had begun that night I would dispense with this formality. I gathered from the emissary that he and other notables had endeavoured to persuade the Shaikh to pay the fine but he had refused* further that the Shaikh never would listen to advice and was most pig headed and obstinate - and I gathered highly unpopular. 16. H.M.S. 'Crocus 0 left for Men.jam early in the morning of the 10th,, while M.M.S.'Oyclamen' left for Shargah, to drop the Residency Agent, and Bushire at 9 a.m. I should like to mention that Oommander V. Brandon, O.tJ.E.,Commanding H.M.3.'Oyol*men' th« aanior Haval Offloer during the abesnoo In Bombay of Oaptaln Pearson did everything In his power to make the trip a auooess, and hie idea of getting the 'Orooua' to meet us at Shargah helped, I think, to settle the ahargah affair6. - &gt; affair, though It did not have that affect at a .Jman as the Shaikh was too dense and obstinate to understand. 17. I regret that this report Is so long, but In the olrounstanoes It seemed advisable to sv^lt a detailed aooount of the matter to the government of Indla,who will, I trust, approve of my prooeedings.

On my recCnt risit I found Shaikh of Ajmanvery much above himself because his Emissary had been well received by Bin Saud and a reply sent to his letter.

With reference to your puniahinent to the Shaikh of Ajir^an 'by demolishing his 8 towers outside Ajman on account of his misbe haviour (l) when Your Honour visit Ajman in the man-o'-wars he does not come for your interview and (2) on account of his unsuit able proceedings towards the British subjects residing at Ajman and also with his neighbours, the Shaikh of Shargah and the inhabitants of Hirah, the said Shaikh has already changed his / former attitude and has desisted from his intrigues against ohargah and Hirah. r5 days after your departure from Ghargah the Shaikh of Ajman sent masons to repair the 2 demolished towers, I told him to stop the repair until I refer the matter to Your Honour and obtain permission for him. 2he Shaikh is preparing plaster at present. I beg to stats that now is the time to fit out the boats for diving and to discuss the matter of claims etc. with the Shaikh of Ajman, I am of opinion that if you see no objection it is very desirable to issue a letter to the Shaikh forbidding him not to repair the two towers until it become known that he behave well .vith the High Government subjects and heed to their claims on account of diving and that he is on friendly terms with his neighbours, the inhabitants of Shargah and Hirah, so that the ohaikh of Ajman desist from mischief making and the people carry on their diving business in a peaceful mind.To 2-^7 Ko.f/f of 1921 • British Residency 'is Oonaulate-General, Bushire, 28th June 1^21.
