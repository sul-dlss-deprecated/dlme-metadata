Monsieur Matine Daftary has been in effect running the Ministry of Justice for some considerable time. He is young and active and is also verv friendly, and has often been helpful to His Majesty’s Legation. His anpointment in the place of Monsieur Sadr, an ineffective nonentity, who looked what he was, a mullah of the old brigade, disguised in modern dress, is decidedly to be welcomed.

I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of despatches from His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Tabriz and Kermanshah recording the recent visit of the Shah, accompanied by the Valiahd, to Azerbaijan and parts of Kurdistan. Though affable at Tabriz the Shah, it would appear, remains his alarming self, and His Imperial Majesty seems to have made no effort to bring his son into the foreground of the activities of the visit. 2. There can be little doubt that these tours by the Shah are of consider able value in stirring apathetic local authorities into certain useful forms of activity, mainly connected with the upkeep of the roads. Enclosure I to Serial No. 4. Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Tabriz, to His Majesty’s charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. 19/355-5-3-36, dated the 19th October 1936. Seeing no immediate possibility of being able to send you this report by safe hand in the near future, I have telegraphed at some length today about the Shah’s visit to Azerbaijan. My object was not primarily to inform you of his actual movements, since they are being fully reported in the press, but rather to convey a more accurate impression than the newspapers are free to give of the attitude of the people here towards their present, and pre sumably their future, rulers.3 2. The Shah and the prince left Tehran on September 29th and travelled via Zinjan, Bustanabad, Ardebil and Ahar, arriving in Tabriz on October 4th. They remained here until the morning of the 7th, when they left by train for Marand and Julfa. Thence they are travelling southwards through Western Azerbaijan. When they reach Mianduab from Sauj Bulak they will have almost completely circled the lake, but at that point they will turn southwards towards Kermanshah. The party includes Hussein Samii, Shakuh-ul-Mulk, Ser Lashkar Nagidi, Dr. Alam and Moadab-i-Nafici. 3. Officials here have represented the tour as having a double purpose. It is a routine visit ol inspection by the Shah, and at the same time an oppor tunity to make the prince acquainted with the northerly parts ol the country. The Shah’s last visit took place two years ago, when he passed through Azer baijan on his way to Turkey. This is the prince’s first visit. 4. As I have reported in my diaries, there had been, quite early in the year, preliminary alarms of this visit, but the authorities did not appear until very nearly the end of September, to know the exact date of the Shah’s arrival. Enough, however, was known early in the month to cause them to begin preparations in earnest. A great effort was made to render the city more attractive superficially by painting woodwork and whitewashing walls along the main khiabans and by erecting long stretches of new walls to mask the unsightly debris of abandoned buildings. The roads were repaired by the emergency method of spreading great quantities of sand and small gravel over them. Soldiers and school-children were drilled intensively, merchants were ordered to purchase new suits, the various branches of the administra tion were overhauled and the people generally were, in so far as the authori ties could influence them, coached to appear in a three-day performance. The tinsel was supplied during the last week in the form of twenty-one arches over the main arteries, erected by communities and merchants, voluntarily in most cases, but at a hint from the police in others. The principal show piece was the new town-clock which the municipal engineer, with the help of a Hungarian electrician, got into temporary working order just in txme for His Majesty’s arrival. 5. The deputies from Azerbaijan arrived back in their districts ahead of the Shah. 6. On the morning of Sunday, October 4th, the soldiers, police and school- children were in position at 8 a.m., about three and a half hours before the royal car appeared. The children had provided themselves with bouquets of flowers, but they had been carefully instructed to drop them near their own feet, and on no account to throw them in the direction of the Shah. Although the bazaars had been closed, the pavements were rather thinly lined, while no spectators were allowed on the roofs or at the upper windows, the police having visited all houses along the royal route to lock the doors of front upper rooms and remove the keys. The people were ill- rewarded lor their long wait. The Shah’s car had come and ^ gone so quickly that few people saw more than a red hat-band on the right side and a vague figure on the left. There was a little perfunctory hand-clapping at some points, at others a chilly silence. Nowhere was there any joyful outburst, and the crowd which dispersed was sullen and unsatisfied. It was obvious that this result was in part due to the Shah’s apparent indiffer ence. Since practically any crowd, anywhere, likes a show it seems probable that if the royal car had been open, instead of closed, and driven at ten instead of about twentyfive miles an hour, there would have been a more cheerful greeting for father and son. There was no halt to examine and admire the triumphal arches. The Shah might have been the general of an army of occupation, passing through the nearly silent lines of people. I am told that when he visited Tabriz as Prime Minister the people cheered and demonstrated whole-heartedly; even two years ago there was warmth m the welcome given to him as compared with last Sunday’s. One must conclude that there is a marked, and growing, lack of sympathy between Riza Shah and the people of this district. 7. The crowd contained a number of unveiled women, but it is estimated that there were no more than a few hundreds of unveiled Moslem women4 in the streets where there were thousands to greet the Shah on previous visits when veils were still worn. The mollahs had been told to stay at home, so that there were neither veils nor turbans to offend the bhah. 8. Havincr disappeared into the barracks, His Majesty did not emerge until Tuesday? He spent the remainder of Sunday and the whole of Monday inspecting the troops and receiving reports from officials. Meantime reports had begun to circulate to the effect that the Shah was in excellent humour. He had made a joke about the beard of one of the merchants who met him on his arrival at the entrace to Tabriz. He had found the garrison m good shape and had congratulated the general m the presence of the troo P s - had even, according to one report, remarked to the Acting Goyernor-Gent c 1 that he had been misled by Ali Mansour about the people of Azerbaijan and was only now realising their fine qualities. This affable condenscension persisted through Tuesday, when the Shah came out to m spect the new municipal buildings now being constructed, the barrage and other works designed to protect Tabriz against floods, the recently completed P ol iyf head quarters, the public gardens and the new large and weff-eqmpped KhoBr vi leather factory. The officials were, of course, relieved and delighted, but the public as a whole remained apathetic. 9 When he met the officials and merchants on arrival, the Shah had enquired about conditions in general, and was assured that, thanks to him everything was going well. He asked what factories had been erected since Ust he 7 was here, Ld how matters stood as regards the produce of the distried. He was told about the new leather and textile factories, ^ ex cellent crops, and listened to praise of the control system, and of the wheat control Tn 1 particular which has yielded high prices for the growers His Majesty made reference to the district, rich in minerals, through which h had just come, and expressed a wish that it should be spec i y eve p for the benefit of all classes. He advised the authorities to improve the Ahar-Tabriz road, and apparently mentioned the desirability of linking Tabriz with Tehran by rail. 10. The Shah has an apparently well-earned reputation for perspicacity. He knows his countrymen well and is capable of delbmg beneath the fair sur- fece of things at monients most inconvenient for them. On this visit, how ever, he has been remarkably docile. He has e W p ^ e d washes walls, seen the things he was meant to see, listened to the Prepared sneeches and reports. It almost seemed as if he had decided beforehand that harmonviWOuld P attend his visit to Azerbaijan and his dealings with its officials The Ali Mansour story, if true, probably means that he wished o ma oesture of approach to the people as a whole, despite his rather grim, eyes-fro Attitude on^arriving, which probably derives from the fact that he has been an iron-fisted martinet too long ever to acquire the gracious, kingly touch towards a crowd. At all events, he failed completely to create goodwi Imong the people. The essential fact is that many people in this city go huncrv to bed while the great majority are labouring under^economic oultieJ The Shah has taken upon himself to regulate their activities in every sphere of life, and since times are hard, they argue that he is to ^“! e * Th17v^t has been judged by one thing only, by its f J^^rom i qhah has done nothing to improve that lot, the visit irom the people’s 6 mrint^of^ view 8 is'a'faduie, a° waste P of public and private money, and ^confirmation that the hopes they placed in him ten years ago are never to be fulfilled Nor was there anv evidence that the prince may be expected to bridge the gap between the throne and the people He was his father s shadow throughout the visit, taking no initiative People ^ terested to see what he looked like, how big he had grown, but if there was anv snark oHov over his first visit to Azerbaijan, it was quenched by the resentment oveTthe recent rise in the price of bread and incident which was not 'ted to His Majesty when the officials told him how excellently the grain control was operating. _ v xt, a*™* 11. In these days, however, there are standards other i e arif , eratic by which to estimate the success of a regime. His aj y ’ r many intelligent people do, hold the view that discontent does not matter5 bo long as it involves no threat to the government, that discomfort for the masses is perfectly proper if it is necessary for the progress of the country as a whole. The Shah’s personal position is probably stronger than either Hitler’s or Mussolini’s, so remote is the possibility of opposition to him in this often, in the past, rebellious province, while he certainly can point to progress which would not have been realised had he subordinated his schemes to the feelings of the people. There are schools which, despite shortcomings, do spread some knowledge; there are new hospitals which do cure some people; factories are going up some of which are economically justifiable; gram silos are being provided which will store the grain in better conditions; there are quite good roads and almost perfect security. It may be possible to hope that prosperity will have returned, and that the prince will have developed sufficiently, before his father’s death, to take and maintain control. If things so happen, the Shah’s present policy will be justified; otherwise, and if the feelings which inspire the common people of this district find expression the future will be a stormy one. 12. The foreign Consuls were not invited to witness, or to take part in, any of the ceremonies. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. 4. Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul, Kermanshah, to His Majsty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 65, dated the 24th October 1936. I have the honour to submit hereunder a report regarding the visit to this Consular district of His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Royal Highness the Vali-Ahd. After a great deal of uncertainty as to the date of the arrival of the Royal party and as to the latter’s plans and movements, the Shah and Vli-Ah deventually left Senneh and arrived at Kermanshah on the 16th instant. After a brief visit to Shahbad and Gilan (the Pusht-i-Kuh district) during the 17th and 18th instant they left Shahabad on the 19th instant for Hamadan arriving there the same afternoon, en route for Tehran. 2. Little definite information has reached me regarding the Shah’s visit to Senneh (Sanandej) but it appears that His Majesty was enraged at the fact that, during the past two years, very little progress had been made at Senneh in building modern houses and shops along the new avenues which had been carved through the town by the wholesale demolition of hundreds of old houses. Shahab-ud-Dowlah Shams-ul-Mulk Arayi, the Governor of Senneh, is reported to have been roundly abused by the Shah for his slackness in not having caused the owners of property along the new roads to rebuild, and one unconfirmed rumour which has reached me is to the effect that the Shah lost his temper with the Governor and gave him a thrashing. In most countries, such a rumour would immediately be dismissed as a grotesque exaggeration; as far as the Shah is concerned the rumour may well be true for His Imperial Majesty, I am informed, is not above resorting to brute force and barrack-room methods if he wishes to inflict punishment on those incurring his displeasure. 3 The Shah is reported to have visited his troops in the Senneh district and to have been satisfied with the manner in which they were being equipped, trained and quartered. His stay at Senneh was, however, of short duration and, having arrived there on the 14th instant, he left for Kermanshah on the morning of the 16th instant. 4. His Majesty (accompanied, of course, by the Vali-Ahd) arrived a Taq-i-Bostan on the outskirts of Kermanshah about 4 p.m. on the 16th instant. Awaiting their arrival at Taq-i-Bostan, were the Governor (Ah Naghi Beglari), the four Deputies representing Kermanshah at the Mejliss, the Senior Military officers and most of the garrison, Heads of the various branches of the Administration and a deputation of notables and members of the Chamber of Commerce. Presentations to His Majesty were made by Amir-i-Kull, one of the four Deputies referred to above. The Consular Corps were not invited to the above reception. 4‘2(C'Er Affairs Dept.5. In tents erected by the roadside the local authorities and the Chamber of Commerce had laid out on tables samples of various local products, e.g., gum tragacanth, cotton, tobacco, wool and beetroots. His Majesty inspected these exhibits and gave orders that in future the cultivation of opium should be decreased and that the area under cotton should be increased, urging that the cultivation of one quality of cotton (of American origin) should be specially developed. In the course of his conversation with the repre sentatives of the Chamber of Commerce he made the remark that it was en tirely thanks to him that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had built their Refinery at Kermanshah, an industrial development which, he claimed, was bringing prosperity to the town. I cannot, of course, say whether the Shah is entitled to claim the credit for this development but there can be no doubt whatever but thab the establishment of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s Refinery here has brought some measure of prosperity to Kermanshah for the Refinery’s monthly wage-bill alone amounts to over 600,000 Rials (i.e., about £8,000), most of which is spent in the town. 6. After the brief halt at Taq-i-Bostan His Majesty and the Vali-Ahd with an escort of five cars, each containing four Imperial Guards armed with short rifles, motored past the Refinery into Kermanshah and went straight to he Governor’s house. The town had been gaily decorated and ten tri umphal arches had been erected to show some outward sign of the populations’ supposed pleasure at receiving the visit of the Shah and the Vali-Ahd. The streets were thronged with the population but as the police, prior to the Shah’s arrival, had given strict orders that no cheering or hand-clapping was to be allowed when the Shah passed through the streets, there was little outward enthusiasm to greet the Shah and the Vali-Ahd during their progress through the town. The Police Authorities forbade the people to occupy first or second floor windows or balconies lining the route, it being desired to prevent as far as possible, any risk of an attempt on the Shah’s life. 7. The Shah having spent only a few minutes at the Governor’s housa on his arrival, left immediately to inspect the local barracks. Not having notified the Military Authorities of his intention to do this so soon after his arrival, the Shah found practically no officers or troops there^—the garrison ‘ en masse ’ still being at Teq-i-Bostan, eight kilometers away, where His Majesty had seen it on parade on his arrival, a bare half-hour earlier. The officers who turned out to salute His Majesty on his arrival at the Barracks were severely reprimanded because they did not salute him correctly with their swords. The Shah having visited the troops’ quarters and tasted the food which was being cooked for the soldiers’ supper, is reported to have expressed himself as generally satisfied with the barrack buildings but as disgusted with their dirty condition. 8. On His Majesty’s return to the Governor’s house where he spent the night, he received there the heads of the local Government Departments, and questioned them on a number of administrative matters and regarding the development of the town. The Shah is reported to have reprimanded some of the officials for their lack of energy in executing the Government’s instructions or in carrying out public works in the town. In particular, he is stated to have severely reprimanded the Rais-i-Baladiyeh (Chief of Municipality) for having failed to lay down pipes for conveying drinking water to the town, a project which His Majesty ordered to be carried out two years ago, during his previous visit to Kermanshah. The Governor too is said to have been reprimanded for not having demolished old houses and built new roads through the town. 9. His Majesty’s feelings of annoyance were hardly soothed when, after he had dismissed the local authorities and was sitting at the dinner-table, the electric lights in the Governor’s house went out, the electric installation at the house being unequal to the unusual strain imposed upon it. His Majesty is reported to have got into a panic when the house was plunged into darkness— possibly he feared that his safety was endangered—and to have lost his temper with the Governor here. Indeed it is rumoured that the Shah who, I am told, does not consider it necessary to restrain his feelings of anger or annoyance7 in public, has the intention of dismissing Ali Naghi Beglari, the Governor here. 10. During the two nights preceding the Shah’s visit and on the night 0^ of his stay in Kermanshah, there was what might almost be termed a sig nificant outburst of robber activity in Kermanshah and in its neighbourhood. A petrol tank lorry and a car following it were held up and looted near Kang- avar and two robberies and a murder took place in the town. I am informed that His Majesty learned of these incidents during his stay here and gave vent to his feelings of disgust with Kermanshah and with its population by bursting out to his entourage that “ the town was nothing but a hot-bed of robbers and contrabandists 11. His Majesty did not visit the Kermanshah schools (where the children for weeks past had been learning how to cheer and to sing songs of welcome), or the Oil Refinery (where the Manager had strained every nerve to paint all his fire buckets green, white and red and to arrange for as many as possible of his staff to procure silk hats and morning coats for the occasion of His Majesty’s visit) or the new Customs House (where the very efficient Director had a creditable, newly built Establishment to shew to His Majesty). He also did not visit the slumy Kurdish quarter here, where he would have seen such a scene of squalor and so many Iranians dressed in non-regulation (and in non-descript) clothing that many people would certainly have been punished in view of such a blatant disregard for the Pahlevi law abolishing hovels and forbidding the wearing of the picturesque Persian clothes which were in general use until a few years ago. 12. If the Shah, as I understand, was not entirely satisfied with what he saw at Kermanshah and with the reports and explanations which he re ceived from his officials here, his visit to Shahabad, Gilan and Hamadan on the other hand, are reported to have given him satisfaction. The sugar factory at Shahabad, after 10 months’ enforced inactivity, had started work ing a few days before His Majesty’s arrival and was a hive of industry when he°inspected it. The hospital at Shahabad too was visited and was found to be sufficiently well administered to receive words of praise from the Shah. The latter gave strict instructions to the local authorities at Shahabad that the campaign against malaria, which is very prevalent there, should be waged with increasing energy. Indeed, His Majesty (who owns most of the Shaha bad district) is reported to be genuinely concerned and interested in improving the living conditions of the population there and to have remarked that if the malaria there cannot be stamped out, he may transfer the sugar factory to a less unhealthy neighbourhood. 13. Although the Shah undoubtedly inspires wholesale fear into his officials, and the population, generally speaking, does not view with favour the present regime (with its many restrictions and its tendency to interfere unduly with the liberty of the people), all Iranians undoubtedly consider that they have several reasons for being grateful to the Shah, and the majority of Iranians would probably agree that, however much they dis approve of the Shah’s rough methods, the country is rapidly making progress in political and economic spheres, thanks to the Shah’s energy and forceful character. Despite occasional outbursts of banditism, public security on the roads is at present almost complete and more general than it was under previous regimes. Honesty among public officials is probably still almost as rare as it has always been in Iran but the fear of the drastic punishments which the Shah can and does swiftly met out to corrupt officials must be acting as a deterrent and in course of time it is just possible that the percentage of honest public servants will slowly increase. Itis probable that Iranians in general would be encouraged to cultivate habits of scrupulous honesty if they felt certain that His Majesty w r as himself a paragon of probity. Doubts on this point are felt by many, for it is remem bered that the Shah was an impecunious officer with negligible private means a comparatively short time ago and now his personal fortune is reported to be immense. 14. The Shah’s visit to this district has, I think, done a great deal of good for His Majesty has infused evergy into the officials, and given considerable8 encouragement to the large agricultural population in the district which, with increased and more general public security here, is likely to develop its production (especially cotton) and to become more prosperous. The Shah’s visit did not, however, gave much satisfaction or comfort to the merchants here who are very dissatisfied with and have been hard hit by the Shah’s system of trade monopolies. Indeed the trading community here felt very sore at being obliged, under threats and pressure from the Police, to buy flags and bunting and to subscribe towards the cost of building the triumphal arches for welcoming the Shah, whose commercial policy has so adversely affected their business. All persons in Kermanshah and its surroundings will agree, however, that whatever else the Shah’s visit may or may not have caused, His Majesty has, by coming here, galvanised into activity the Public Works and Municipal Authorities who have repaired roads amd bridges which otherwise would have remained, possibly indefinitely, in a sad state of disrepair. ( 5 ) DESPATCH FROM HlS MAJESTY’S MINISTER, TEHRAN, TO HlS MAJESTY’S SEC RETARY of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 540/133-17-36, DATED THE 25TH DECEMBER 1936. In paragraph 7 of your despatch No. 410 (E 6326/18/93) of the 7th Oct ober last you asked for certain information concerning the succession to the estate of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah. I now have the honour to report all the information which I have hitherto been able to obtain in this matter; I realise that many details are lacking; the meagreness of my report is due not only to the evident inadvisability of asking direct questions, but to the fact that the heirs have so far refrained altogether from approaching this Legation. 2. From the Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran and another source I learn that a lawyer named Murteza Keshvari, representing the principal widow, the lady Batool Mafi known as Fakhr us Saltaneh, applied to the local court for a certificate of exclusive heirship in favour of his client on the 9th June last. After the usual formalities, which include publication of the application in the Official Journal of the Ministry of Justice on three successive occasions at intervals of a month in order that any objections may be made, the certificate was issued on the 25th October. The delay seems to have been due to objections which were made by two women, one named Mashaqqat Khanum (represented by the lawyer Afrasiab Azad) and Nazifeh Khanum, represented by the lawyer Abdullah Keshvari. These two ladies who apparently alleged that they had been married to the late Sheikh, sub sequently withdrew their claims. 3. The certificate of heirship states that one eighth part of the movable property, together with one eighth part of the “ a’yan ” (a technical word which means the whole of the trees, houses, and anything else above the sur face of the ground on the landed properites of the deceased) belong to the widow Batool Mafi. The rest of the estate belongs to the heirs cited in a long list of twenty seven names, a copy of which I enclose. Each of the male heirs in accordance with the civil code and the shar ’ law, take twice the por tion of each of the female heirs. Abdol Hamid (Sardar Ajall) is appointed guardian for heirs Nos. 1 to 7; the widow Batool Mafi is appointed guardian for No. 8, who is no doubt her son; and Abdul Karim (Sardar Lashkar) and a certain Muayyad Ahmedii are appointed as supervisors over the guardian ship, I presume in regard to each of the three guardians. 4. There are no doubt other descendants and relicts of the Sheikh in Iraq and Koweit, and perhaps also in the south of Iran. Presumably, how ever, such persons have now lost all claim to any part of the estate in Iran. 5. As far as I can gather no actual division of the Sheikh’s property has yet taken place. It will be a complicated business. Morteza Keshvari represents the widow Batool Mafi only, the other heirs being represented by a certain Manuchihr Ahmedi, probably the son of Muayyad Ahmedi mentioned above.9 6. As for the second point mentioned in paragraph 7 of your despatch under reference, I have no information as to the manner of division of the Iraqi estate of the deceased; I presume that the heirs will have to obtain separate grants of what corresponds to probate from Iraqi courts in respect of the estate existing in that country. 7. As for the relative merits of the various heirs, judged by their beha viour towards their late father, Mr. Trott, who is the only member of my staff who knows any of them personally, informs me as follows. The one whom the Sheikh hated most heartily was Abdullah, who served for some time in the Persian Army; the Sheikh regarded him as a traitor who was largely instrumental in betraying the Sheikh to the Persian troops in 1925. Chasib, Abdul Aziz, Mansoor, Abdol Majid, Abdul Jalil, and Mohammed Saeed were never spoken of by the Sheikh to Mr. Trott; they appear to have kept clear of him, drawing large allowances every month; Chasib, the eldest, at one time was drawing more than £100 per month, but latterly had to be content with less. He married a nurse at Basrah who was either English or Irish; he lived with her in Ireland till about a year ago, when he deserted her and her child; Sir Arnold Wilson, who knew all the family well, wrote Chasib a very strong letter about this desertion, I understand. The two sons who stayed by their father and did their best to help him were Abdul Hamid (Sardar Ajall) and Abdul Kerim (Sardar Lashkar). The former has lived at Tehran, in a separate establishment from his father, for some years, and is believed to be still here. The Sheikh had periodical disputes with him, especially during the past three years; but on the whole Abdul Hamid did his best for his father. Abdul Kerim is younger, and lived all the time in his father’s house; he it was who recently went to Basrah to bring back certain documents for the Sheikh. He seemed to Mr. Trott to be the best of the sons. Whether any of them qualify for mention in the same rank as the “ pious Aeneas ” one may take leave to doubt. 8. I regret I have very little to say on the point raised in the penultimate paragraph of your despatch. The attitude of the Iranian Government during the last few years of the Sheikh’s life was simply to wait for him to die. They put no special impediments in the way of remittances from Basrah; and I do not imagine they will actively impede the payment of any sums due to the heirs who remain in Iran. As for any sum which might be allotted to them as compensation under the 1914 pledge, I imagine that all the heirs would much rather have the money paid into an account abroad for them than to have it remitted here in local currency which they would find it impossible to remit abroad. I do not consider that the Iranian Courts will, in practice, discriminate between any of the heirs mentioned in the certificate of exclusive heirship; nor do I think that the Iranian Government would be likely to give much diplomatic support to the cause of the heirs who re mained Iranian subjects. The standpoint of the Iranian Government will be, I think, that the Sheikh’s heirs are undesirables whom it would be well to get rid of; the sons are not likely to have much loyalty towards the state which so effectively destroyed their father; nor are the Iranians likely to trust or support the offspring of Reza Shah’s rival. 9. The only other information which I posess at present concerning the Sheikh’s heirs is as follows; it emanted from Mr. Gardener at Ahwaz; Chasib arrived in Basrah at about the end of August, and is being treated well by the Iraqi Government, who had even given him a bodyguard. A report stated that Abdul Majid, from the Cha’b Arabs, had joined him in Basrah, together with one of the Sheikh’s sons-in-law; the last named had been living in Abadan, where he had been closely watched by the local police; but he eluded them, with his wife and family. The local police at Khorram- shahr arrested recently one of the Sheikh’s wives and her two daughters and took them to Tehran, but one of the daughters died on the road. The offence alleged against this party was that of having established contact with Chasib. Abdul Aziz was also said to be with Chasib in Basrah. 10. lam sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 267 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baedad No. 100. 6 42(0) ExAffairsDept.10 Enclosure to Serial No. 5.

I enclose a copy of an extract from a very confidential letter from Mr. Jones of Hawker Aircraft to Rendel of the Eastern Department here, which has some bearing on Mohammad Ihsan’s negotiations. I understand that Captain Bayendor is a Persian who is negotiating with Hawkers on behalf of his Government. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fraser-Tytler and to Williams at the Air Ministry. Enclosure to Serial No. 7. Extract from letter addressed to Foreign Office by Hawker Air craft Limited, dated 28th November 1936. Captain Bayendor returned from Paris this morning. He witnessed demonstrations of French aircraft at Villacoublay. Whilst there they had an opportunity of conversing with the gentleman from Afghanistan. According to Bayendor this gentleman is the prospective chief of the Afghan Air Force and he informed them that he had been to Germany and Great Britain where he had seen several factories. After his visit to France he was returning to this country and then hoped to go to America to see their latest products. At the lunch at Villacoublay this gentleman was given the seat of honour next to Mons. Pierre Cot. They gathered that it was intended to eventually acquire a considerable Air Force but that apparently there was financial difficulty. It was stated that the Soviet Authorities were prepared to supply on very favourable terms but it was not possible to obtain any idea as to whether this proposal was viewed with favour.

This incident was mentioned orally to Ansarie, Head of our Depart ment at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the 23rd October. He was asked to try to get the Ministry of War to ensure that all subordinates were told that the Company’s regulations in such matters must be observed. He agreed that the regulations were reasonable, and said that he would take the matter up with the Ministry of War. We hope that there will be no repetition of the refusal to give up arms. ( 13 ) Express letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident, Bushire, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 73/33-117, dated the 24th December 1936. Repeated to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, India Office, London (No. 2577). The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi (No. 2578). The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf (No. 2579). As you are aware from the despatches of His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, Nos. 60 and 61 dated the 23rd and 28th November respectively a case has recently occurred in which a German sailor in a German Merchant vessel 42(C) ExAffairsDept.14 anchored in the Outer Anchorage at Bushire became involved in an affray an T-panian oooly on l&gt;oai , cl tKo aViip aa a roaTilt of nrlirola + lyo oool^ on returning ashore lodged a complaint against the sailor with the Iranian police in Bushire, and the sailor was brought back to Bushire from Bandar Shahpur the next port of call, in an Iranian naval vessel for trial in the Bushire law Courts. 2. The point which is of general interest is that there now exists, as a result of the German sailor’s submission to Iranian jurisdiction, a precedent for the arrest and trial by the Iranians of a foreign subject accused of an offence committed in a foreign merchant vessel at the Outer Anchorage, Bushire, which is situated beyond the limits of what His Majesty’s Government re cognize as territorial waters, i.e., three miles. 3. A similar affray need not perhaps be anticipated on a British vessel, but cases sometimes occur of passengers, who are British subjects or protected persons or subjects of the Arab Shaikhdoms with whom we are in special relations, infringing the regulations which the Iranians impose on ships anchored off Bushire, e.gr., by selling goods on board to coolies who go out to work the cargo. 4. I should, therefore, be glad to receive instructions as to the line of action I should take in the event of the local authorities seeking to arrest and bring ashore from a vessel in the Outer Anchorage a person in any of the above categories entitled to British protection accused of an offence against Iranian law. ( 14 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 5-E, dated the 8th January 1937. With reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 482 E of the 24th October, 1936, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the Annual *Report of the Banque Agricole et Industrielle de I’lran. 2. Apart from the balance sheet, which was reported in Mr. Butler’&amp; despatch under reference, the report deals with the extensive participations of the Banque in various commercial, industrial and agricultural concerns. The information given is thus complementary to that contained in the latest bulletin of the Banque Mellic Iran and reported in my despatch No. 3 E of the 6th January. The mention, on page 7, of the exclusive right of dealing in sugar and matches, as regard both importations and local production having been granted to the Soci6te Centrale, is of interest; so far as I am aware no other notification to this effect has been published. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (unnumbered), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 3 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad No. 4.

His Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of despatch from Mr. Acting Consul Gault, No. 97, dated Isfahan, the 20th October, 1936, enclosing a report on the Political conditions in Isfahan. * * Not printed. Kept with original.15 Enclosure 1. Despatch from His Majesty’s Acting Consul, Isfahan, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 97, dated the 20th October 1936. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a brief survey in general ISFAHAN has always been known as one of the homes of conservatism in Iran, and to the observer who has watched the progress in other parts of the country of the dress and other social reforms introduced in recent years the reputation appears still to be justified, although in the field of commerce Isfahan is more advanced than anywhere else in the country. 2. Fortunately for the peace of mind of the inhabitants of Isfahan, the Governor of the town and province for the last three years, Qasim Sur Israfil, appears to be of that type, so rare in Iran nowadays, which has the wit to per ceive to what extent a people of the character of the Isfahan! can be driven without its objections taking any violent form. He has had the sense not to seek to drive the Isfahan! beyond that point. He has had the good fortune, too, to be able to a large extent to offset the undoubtedly slow progress of the social reforms by the striking advances made by the town in commerce and industry, and thus ward off any displeasure which the authorities in Tehran may harbour against him. 3. To-day in Isfahan the old-fashioned wide cotton trouser of the work man or peasant is still noticeable by its frequency, as is the little embroidered skull cap which many men wear under their newly adopted brimmed mons trosity. Even the tall pointed cap which can be seen in any picture or draw ing of the 19th Century has not entirely disappeared. The long and elegant frock-coat, which has almost disappeared in the north, is still the customary attire of many men here. With the women it is the same, especially among the poorer classes, where a hat is still conspicuous by its absence and black trousers down to the ankle are usual rather than otherwise. Even the chadur can be seen on occasion, though not often. It is said that the better class Isfahan! women have not taken at all kindly to the reform of their dress decre ed earlier in the year, and that many of the older ones now stay at home sooner than go out unveiled. However this may be, it is certain that very few women, except Armenians and other unbelievers, are to be seen about the streets in western dress. The evening crowd in the Chahar Bagh Avenue is almost entirely composed of men, although army officers are to be seen out with their wives occasionally. 4. Mullahs in turban and abba are still numerous, although a few may have accepted, or been dragooned into accepting, the change into Euro pean dress. The number of men to be seen saying their prayers by the road side or in the fields is also striking after the relative irreligion of other parts of Iran, and especially as the Shia, as opposed to the Sunni Moslem, does not profess to make a great business of his daily prayers. 5. Compared with the Shirazi, known for his laziness and love of arrack, the Isfahan! looks a far healthier fellow and better built. He is harder work ing than most Iranians, and his thrift is witnessed by the ancient tale of the Isfahani who always kept his cheese in a glass vessel in order to be able to get its flavour simply by rubbing his bread on the outside of the glass and thereby avoid using up the cheese. The relative wealth of the town is shown by the fact that the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran, which was formerly dependent very largely upon its foreign exchange business for profitable working, is now so busy with local and internal business that it can forget the competition of the rival Bank Mellie and would have to increase its staff were its business to increase very much. &amp; terms of the political situation in Isfahan as it has appeared to me during my stay here. Enclosure 2. Report on Political Conditions in Isfahan, October 1936.16 6. As far as can be ascertained, those members of the old leading families who survive, Qajar and Bakhtiari, now live quietly but peacefully in and around Isfahan, where most of them still have extensive estates. They are not allowed, most of them, to go to Tehran or move about much, nor can they see foreigners. A scion of the Bakhtiari Ilkhani family is now studying at the Stuart Memorial College (now called the Dabiristan Adab). Prince Sarem-ed-Dowleh, “ the matricide ”, has assumed the cloak of middle- class respectability by taking the post of managing director of a company which has just been formed to erect and operate a paper mill, but he is care ful to avoid contact with foreigners, even with the English missionaries, who can see most people. 7. The Bakhtiari tribes are now said to be more or less settled, except in the remoter parts of their country. A traveller from Ahwaz, however, who came through Bakhtiari to Isfahan this summer said that he saw a goodly number of tribesmen carrying fire-arms. Nearer Isfahan, on the other hand, disarmament among the villages seems to be so complete now that even the leopards know that they have a sporting chance against any single man they may meet, for the Church Missionary Society’s hospital here has had a number of cases of wounds from such encounters. In Isfahan itself guns, allegedly confiscated from the Bakhtiari tribes, appear to be obtainable by Iranians from the military without great difficulty, and there does not seem to be much restriction on game shooting by Iranians. 8. Some effort seems to be put forth by the authorities to encourage the Julfa Armenians to participate in the industrial boom and form a company of their own. But they say that they are still the object of discrimination in practice, and that the Government is doing its best to limit the teaching of the Armenian language in their own schools. 9. The wave of anti-Semitism which swept over many parts of Iran recently seems to have passed completely, if it did not entirely miss, Isfahan, for the Jewish community here, which consists almost wholly of Iranian Jews and, with one or two notable exceptions, is poor rather than rich, does not appear to suffer under any special disabilities at the moment. 10. Foreigners in general are treated with much less suspicion and dis trust than in some other parts of Iran, and it is possible for a private individual to mix in local society. The Soviet consul-general, M. Atabekoff, is a member both of the Iranian club in Isfahan and of the Armenian club in Julfa, having been invited to join the Iranian club by the Governor of Isfahan. He can invite Iranians to his house, provided that the Governor be of the party, and receives as many as fifty or sixty on the occasion of his national day. Both the Imperial Bank and the Church Missionary Society are regarded with respect and friendliness, and in the case of the mission a good deal of help, both official and unofficial, is given to its activities. On the whole, the British community here enjoys a better position than in towns such as Ker- manshah and Hamadan. The German community, too, though divided against itself by personal likes and dislikes, also seems to enjoy Iranian favour. It is probable that this greater degree of favour displayed towards foreigners in general is due, in part, at any rate, to the enlightenment of the Governor, who has realised that Iran can, and does, benefit from their activities. The position which certain individuals have won for themselves in the eyes of Iranians here has also helped to cause a favourable view to be taken of their compatriots. 11. Isfahan is not a town which enjoys any special favour in the eyes of the Shah—the only time he came here, some years ago now, he spent the night outside the town—and the feeling is reciprocated by the Isfahanis. Nevertheless the activities of the Zill-es-Sultan and his large family and of the many Bakhtiari khans are not for that reason remembered with any pleasure. The Isfahani would probably like nothing better than to be left alone to work, but government in Iran, as it grows more experienced and elaborate, enters more and more deeply into the every day life of the peo ple and, from he point of view of the average man, its nuisance value tends to outgrow any other value it may have had in protecting him from the18 Sub-enclosure 1 to enclosure 2 of Serial No. 16.

Firm named Dashwood and Partners of 27, Grosvernor Place, have asked for licence to export 20,000,000 rounds of old British army point 303 inch cartridges, costing £55,000 ostensibly consigned to Persian Government. Ammunition being old surplus stock is not of quality which Persian Govern ment would normally acquire, nor of usual claibre. It is to be consigned to Bushire or Mohammerah, instead of to normal port of Bandar Shahpur. 2. There is of course no objection to grant of licence if Persian Govern ment have genuinely ordered ammunition for their own use. But in view of danger of shipments of these arms being destined for Spanish territory with out knowledge of Persian Government, please endeavour to obtain and tele graph Persian Government’s confirmation. 3. Home Office suspect that efforts are being made to ship not only rifle ammunition but other military material to Spain disguised as shipments to Persia and that certain members of Persian purchasing commission may be involved. You may at your discretion mention this to Persian Govern ment.19 ( 18 ) {Received on 15th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 4, dated 15th January 1937.)

Esq., C.M.G., C.V.O., His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 150-S, dated the 1st February 1937, I have just received Butler’s despatch No. 468 of the 12th October 1936, to the Foreign Office, giving a panorama of this country ten years after the Coronation of the Shah, which has now reached me in blue print form. 2. Tucked away in Bushire I am of course far from well placed for giving views on Iran in general, but if I may say so I think Butler has painted a convincing picture of modern Iran. 3. The material progress, and particularly the progress in law and order, made by Iran since the days when I first knew this country is of course con siderable. The interesting question (which is dealt with in Butler’s despatch- is: will this progress continue when the Shah is gathered to his fathers ? Most of us, as a relief from ordinary office routine, have had a try at this intriguing20 speculation. Mine is contained in enclosure. The Future of Persia, to my demi-official letter No. 815-S-, dated the 28th October 1932 to Hoare, copy forwarded to the Government of India and India Office under my demi-official letters Nos. 691-S. and 692-S., dated the 17th October 1931, respectively. 4. At the end of paragraph 17 of that report I envisaged the possibility&gt; if ‘ Iran ’ became once more the old unregenerated ‘ Persia ’, of our having, as in pre-war days, to interfere actively in the internal affairs of this country. Since I wrote, however, five years have passed, and during that time our interests in Iran have diminished. Our Air Route and Naval Base are now fortunately on the Arab side, and unfortunately our trade with Iran has dwindled, and a number of our traders—British Indians for the most part— have left the country. This being so, except of course for protecting the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s refinery at Abadan and their oil-fields, we might I suppose safely let Iran indulge in as much anarchy as she liked without intervening. 5. Whether Iran holds firm after the Shah’s disappearance seems to me to depend almost entirely on the Army, wffiich has given her law and order, the foundation on which the present modern Iranian edifice is constructed. If the Army disintegrates with the disappearance of the Shah, (and it is of course more than any other Iranian institution his personal creation), then the rest of the edifice will undoubtedly crash. The opinion of the Khorassan landowner quoted in paragraph 2 of Butler’s despatch is certainly pessimistic but perhaps not unduly so. 6. With regard to Iranian Officials, I imagine that the situtation is as indicated in paragraph 3 of Butler’s despatch. During my time here local Governors have succeeded one another fairly rapidly. One or two of them have had ability and ‘ guts ’, but most of them have been poor creatures frightened of giving any decision, however unimportant, without reference to Tehran. What it comes to is that there are of course able and energetic Iranian Officials, but not enough of them to go round. No team is much good which is composed of a few ‘ tigers’, and the rest ‘ rabbitsV^^sin the Iranian Civil Service side the rabbits unfortunately preponderate. ^ . 7. I quite agree with what Butler says in his paragraph 4 about Iranian national feeling. This feeling even in the old days existed as pointed out in paragraph 15 of my report already quoted, and has undoubtedly been intensified by the rule of the present Shah. 8. One does not hear much of the Valiahd, and so Butler’s paragraph 6 was interesting. He—the Valiahd—will certainly require to take an out size in footwear in order to slip into his father’s shoes, though of course the longer his father lives, the easier will it be for him to do this. I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and Walton. ( 20 ) (Received on 6th March 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 7, dated 18th February 1937).

( 21 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 73 (318/2 /37), dated the 27th February 1937. I have the honour to report that a parade of troops took place at the race-course at Jalaliych on the 23rd February, the anniversary of the coup d’ etat of 1921. This year invitations were issued to the whole of the Diplo matic corps, who were accommodated in a specially built stand of concrete, a great improvement on the tents of previous years. 2. The following remarks on the parade are made up on the basis of the report submitted by Major Pybus, No. 78/1936 of the 28th February 1936 (S. No. 40 of File No. 31-N/36). I am indebted to the French Military atta che for some of the detailed information. 3. The parade was announced to start at 1-30 p.m. It was very well attended, and the staff arrangements for parking cars were much better than those of last year. Special invitations had been sent to the Tehran correspondents of English papers and newsagencies. The large race-course grand-stand was full of deputies of the Majlis, government officials, and promi nent members of the Iranian and European population of Tehran. Top- hats were the correct dress for the stands ; and a remarkable number of this form of head-gear were seen, the most original exhibit being that of a deputy who had put on a black Honburg hat with the depression at the top pushed out. The bank of foreign Military Attaches was strengthened by the pre sence of Colonel Hans Rohde, the newly-arrived German Military Attach^ for Angora, Athens, and Tehran. 4. The various units were drawn up in good time on the northern side of the race-course. The weather was not so cold as last year, and flying condi tions were satisfactory, with a light wind only. His Majesty arrived about 2 p.m. in the same venerable Rolls-Royce as last year. He was not accom panied by the pahlevi Queen or by the two princesses. The only explana tion which I have heard of their absence is that they were too busy preparing themselves for the two marriages which are due to take place in a few days. The Shah was however accompanied by six of his sons, viz., the Vali-ahd and the five younger princes, Ali Reza, Gholam Reza, Abdul Reza, Ahmed Reza, and Mahmond Reza. All were dressed in khaki great-coats. His Majesty first rode up to the troops who were waiting on the north side of the race-course, and inspected them for about ten minutes. 5. The march-past of troops began shortly afterwards. The Shah took the salutes from the same pavilion as last year, and appeared pleased with what he saw. He conversed occasionally with the Crown prince, and with 42(C) ExAffairsDept.£ 22 the chief of the General Staff and the Acting Minister of War. Aeroplanes began to fly over the saluting point soon after the march-past started. The formation flying was not very good, the alignments being irregular. Ac cording to the French Military Attach^ and other observers there were sixty- six-planes taking part. Actually however I believe, from a reliable source, that the correct number was fifty-two, made up as follows :— Tiger moths . Five flights of five machines • • 25 Audax and Fury . Four flights of five machines • 20 Audax and Fury . One flight of seven machines 7 Total 52 No stunting was attempted. 6. The units marched past in the following order :— (i) 30 troops of girl guides, the average strength of each troop being about 30 ; there could not, therefore, have been much more than 900 girl guides, though the local newspapers reported double that number. (ii) About 2,200 Boy Scouts. liii) Students from the secondary schools, in their grey uniform suits and peaked caps ; numbering about 2,000. (iv) The cadets of the military school. Strength about the same as last year ; i.e., about 1,200. (v) Three platoons of the Iranian Navy, average strength 60. The French Military Attache has heard that they were all from the Caspian Division, but it is more probable that they were com posed in the same way as last year ; i.e., one platoon from the Caspian Division and the other two from the Persian Gulf Division. (w) Four platoons of the Iranian Air Force, each platoon consisting of four files of about 24 men each. (vii) Two battalions of engineers, one from the first and one from the second division. t v iii) Eight regiments of infantry, four being from the first division and V four from the second. Each regiment consisted of three batta lions. (ix) Light artillery on heavy-draught Hungarian shire-horses, recently imported. The guns were 75 m.m. Bofors ; one brigade from the first division and one from the second division; each brigade consisting of 6 four-gun batteries. (x) Field Artillery—twelve four-gun batteries of Skoda 1-05 m.m. guns. (xi) The cavalry school ; about 140 riders. (xii) Four cavalry regiments, two from each division. Each regiment V had 8 Maxim machine-guns, of Swiss license, and four squadrons of swords, each squadron having eight light machme- guns. Ixiii) Horse artillery. Three four-gun batteries of guns. There V seems a great doubt what these guns really were ; different authorities say they were Schneider guns, or Russian guns ot an old pattern, or Austrian guns of a recent pattern.* « % * 23 (xiv) Armoured cars. Four old Rolls-Royce pattern headed the parade. Then followed 19 Marmon four-wheelers. 1 am in formed that 31 Marmon six-wheelers exist, but they did not appear at this parade. (xv} Tanks. Eleven heavy 6| ton Czecho-Morawaka tanks each 1 armed with 1-37J m.m. gun and 2 heavy machine-guns were the main feature of this part of the parade, there were also 39 lighter tanks, of 3^ tons, from the same factory, each armed with one heavy machine gun and one light machme- gun. These tanks went by in three sections, each section consisting of 12 tanks and a separate one for the Commanding Officer. (xvi) Field Artillery, consisting of 12-105 m.m. guns, drawn by the new Hungarian draught-horses. (xvii) Mechanised anti-aircraft artillery, comprising 2 batteries of 75 m.m. D. C. A. Bofors guns. There were no acrobatics or displays of trick-riding gy mnast ^ c ®’ ® t h c ' The march-past finished at about 4-45 P.M., and the Shah drove off in the Rolls-Royce followed by his sons and his suits. 8 Most of the remarks as to formation, turn-out, marching discipline, etc., madet the last report apply this year except ^a“he equipment of the troops seemed more uniform and newer ; the boots of the men weie eit brand new or well polished and the rank and file looked cleaner. A noteworthy feature of this parade was the new Hungarian horses ; I hear that about 1,200 of these animals have been imported into Iran, but that they are not standine the climate and altitude well ; several have died, and the uniortu nate officers in charge have the unpleasant duty of reporting each casua y direct to the Shah. 9. I have been informed by Iranian friends that the Sha ^ ^, t C .^ t of troops^ the man picked himself up and went on, leaving his water-bottle to be kicked by the following troop. 10 Four Iraqi army officers attended the parade, named as follows Pol on el Baha-un-din Nouri, Major Akram Mushtaq, and Captains Rafiq brltrots^^Tym-re^tXned on the'ISebruary aTa receptiong^ven taiy attaches were invited, and the Minister tor t ^ he hpd heard kept fully up to date. take part in the day s pro g admiration which this feat evokes “ be borne in thisCountry, which it has involved. n Tam sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s Ambassador at Baghdad No 16 and the 7 Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 35.24 ( 22 ) {Received on 27th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 6, dated 11th February 1937).

( 23 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign AffAiRS, London, No. 71 (264-3-37), DATED THE 26TH FEBRUARY 1937. I have the honour to inform you that on the afternoon of Friday, 19th February, the Shah accompanied by the Valiahd and other royal princes performed the ceremony of inaugurating the Northern sector of the Trans- Iranian Railway at the still unfinished station in Tehran. I enclose a copy of the issue* of the “ Journal de Teheran ” of the 21st February,^containing an account of the proceedings and the speech of the Minister of Communica tions, which summarises what has and what remains to be accomplished. It will be seen that it is hoped to complete the Southern sector next year. 2. The ceremony seems to have been a success. The day was a Moslem Sunday ; Tehran and the neighbouring villages were beflagged by order and large crow r ds streamed on foot, by motorbus or other vehicle down the hand some new boulevard which leads to the Station on the south-western out- skirt of the city. The Station is a fine, if extravagant, building ; it stands high and future travellers emerging from it will enjoy a wide and magnificent panaroma of the Alborz range with Demavend dominating the North-East. 3. Only eight Europeans are said to have been invited to the ceremony among them the three principal Directors of the Kamp-sax Consortium. The Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran was I believe, the only Bri tish subject to be invited. It w r as explained to the Diplomatic Corps that their turn would come when the whole Railway was finished, but some resent ment was felt at their exclusion by the representatives of the Scandinavian countries in particular. Monsiei r Engell, Minister of Denmark, who resides normally in Moscow, had made a special visit to Tehran for the occasion and to present decorations to the Shah as well as to the principal Kampsax officials. He can hardly have anticipated that he would not be invited to attend the ceremony. 4. Passenger trains will not run the full Northern sector for another three months at least. The Shah is believed to be about to visit the South, and great efforts are certainly being made to speed up the comp letion of the Southern Sector. The newspapers, I need hardly say, have used the occasion to renew their tributes to the Shah’s energy and vision, and to the confidence created by his personality without which foreign capital on the large scale required would not have been forthcoming. 5. I enclose also some photographs from other issues of the “ Journal de Teheran ” which give an idea of the Station at Tehran and of the scale of the Railway. 6.

With reference to my despatch No. 462 of the 14th October 1936 (S. No. 92 of File No. 31-N/36), I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, a list prepared by the Commercial Secretary giving details of the more impor tant recent developments in connection with new companies formed in Iran. 2. The position in respect of Monopoly Companies, does not appear to be entirely satisfactory. In his Overseas Trade despatch No. (B) 21 of 22nd January last, Mr. Simmonds reported the appointment of Monsieur Ala as Director of a Board to control the activities of the Government com panies, and also that all credit in foreign and local exchange to these com panies has been temporarily stopped. It is generally believed that the over head charges of these concerns are very high and probably due to the pay ment of high salaries to large staffs composed of incompetent relatives and friends of the heads of the companies. It is said, on good authority, that cuts in pay are to be enforced, in some cases of 33 per cent. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, unnumbered, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 22, to His Majesty’s Ambassador No. 9 and to all His Majesty’s Consular- Officers in Iran, Circular despatch No. 7. Enclosure to S. No. 24. List of the more Important New Companies Formed in Iran. 1. A company has been formed at Tabriz, named “ Nouche-Azar ”, with a capital of 800,000 rials (£10,000) for the installation of a brewery. (Setareh-ye-Jehane, 20-10-36). (There is already one brewery. “ Bavaria ”, at Tabriz.) 2. A company, “ Societ6 par Actions Nouchabeh Kerman et Abassi ” has been formed at Kerman for the manufacture of alcoholic liquor. The Agricultural Bank bought the major part of the shares. The Company will prepare its products in accordance with a system which will ensure a pro fitable market abroad, particularly in India. (Journal de Teheran of 26-10 36). 3. The Society Kala, which has been given the monopoly of the sale of fish and caviar, has opened shops in different parts of Tehran. (Bazaar Re port of 30-10-36). 4. A company has been formed at Shiraz with a capital of 20,000,000 rials (£250,000) for the sale of locally-produced cotton goods. 5. A company for making films, with a capital of 300,000 rials (£3,750) has been formed at Tehran. ( “ Setareh-ye-Djehana ”, 18-11-36). 6. It is proposed to form a company at Sultanabad for the manufacture of cotton carpets. Capital 300,000 rials (£3,750). (“ Setareh-ye-Djehane ”, 27-11-36). 7. A company has been formed at Kerman for the complete preparation of “ laine et autres solon les derni&amp;res donnees modernes ”. The capital has been fixed at 2,600,000 rials (£32,500). 8. A company with a capital of 3 million rials (£37,500) is to be formed at Tehran for dealing in “ tombac ” (Qalian &amp; pipe tobacco). The following recent developments in Azarbaijan were reported by H.M, Consul at Tabriz on 16th January 1937 : - (a) A campany has been formed at Tabriz under the name of Sherkat SahamiMey Nab Azerbaijan, with a capital of 600,000 rials 42(0 Ex AffairsDept.26 (£7,500), with branches at Maragha and Rezaieh (Urmia), for the preparation and sale of alcoholic beverages over a period of ten years. (6) The Sherkat Sahami Ahan Mahadoud was registered on 24-10-36 at Tabriz, with a capital of 1,000,000 rials (£12,500) to import and sell iron, ironware, industrial and agricultural machinery and equipment. (c) In December 1936 the Deputy for Rezaieh invited the local mer chants and others in Rezaieh to discuss the formation of a company which would plant hemp and manufacture sacks etc. The meeting decided to adopt the project, and to form a com pany with a capital of 1,500,000 rials (£18,750). The necessary third is being collected so that the concern may be registered. The machinery will be ordered from Germany. 9. The shareholders of the Electric Company and of the company formed to help artisans at Shiraz (see No. 16 in list forwarded under cover of despatch No. 41 E of 24-1-36) have decided to instal a soap factory and a perfumery factory. The raw material for these productions are said to be available in the neighbourhood of Shiraz. (“ Journal de T6heran ”, 7-2-1937.) S. S.,—16-2-1937. ( 25 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 95-E., dated the 12th March 1937. With reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 137-E of the 19th March 1936,1 have the honour to transmit to you herewith, a copy of the announce ment published in “ Le Journal de Teheran ” of 8th March of the single article concerning the budget for the year 1316 (21st March 1937 to 20th March 1938). No detailed list of the estimates has been published but the total revenue is estimated at 1,250,002,911 rials (£15,625,036) and expenditure at rials 1,248,031,737 (£15,600,400). 2. The detailed budget is to be submitted by 21st May 1937 ; until then the Ministry of Finance will be authorised to effect payments under the 1316 budget, but on the basis of the detailed list of the 1315 budget. 3. The withholding of detailed estimates is no doubt due to the difficult financial situation created by the shortage of both foreign exchange and local currency. A considerable deficit was expected in the forthcoming budget and it is difficult to see how the 25 per cent, increase in the expenditure over the previous year’s total is to be met. 4. A second bill (a copy of which is furnished herewith) was submitted to the Majliss at the same time as the budget, and this may affect the financial situation and facilitate matters before 21st May next. This bill concerned the purchase from various Bakhtiaris of founders shares in The First Exploita tion Company and the Bakhtiari Oil Company, from which emerged the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, obtained when the former concerns started the exploitation. I understand from the Tehran Representative of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that the Bakhtiaris received what was, in the circumstances, a fair price for the shares. The number of shares now taken over by the Iranian Government is 37,320 and the value estimated at 27,757,993-60 rials (£347,000 approximately at 80 rials to the Pound). By the single article in this bill, the Ministry of Finance would be authorised to use this sum for credits in connexion with organizations for public utility. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, unnumbered, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 46, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 20.28 Aussi, en vue de garantir le credit n^cessaire, 1’ Article Unique suivant est soumis au Parlement avec pri&amp;re de ratification.

Covering letter No. [E 1117/1117/34, dated 9th Mar. 1937]. P. Z. 1642/37. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Mejesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No 38, dated the 26th January 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 433 E. of the 19th September last, I have the honour to report that M. Cemal Husnu, the head of the Turkish mission which arrived in Iran in October last, is still in Tehran but expects to finish his negotiations shortly. 2. From what M. Husnu has told me it seems that the negotiations have not led to any very important results. A commercial agreement will, I understand, be concluded, but there have been a good many difficulties over it and it is not likely to have any remarkable effects. The Turkish delegation have naturally found it difficult to achieve much when the Iranian Govern ment are already so committed, as regards their international trade, by their agreements with Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Nor does there seem much scope,even if this difficulty were removed, for increasing the trade between Turkey and Iran. 3. Attempts have been made to negotiate a consular convention, but this will almost certainly have to be left for the Turkish Embassy to deal with after the mission’s departure. It has not yet been possible for the Turkish re presentatives to overcome the reluctance of the Iranian Government to agree to the inclusion of the whole country in consular districts. The reluctance of the Iranian Government to accept proposals of this kind is already well known to your Department. 4. M. Husnu has taken a great personal interest in the promotion of a civil air service between Angora and Tehran. His instructions were to propose a fully reciprocal Turco-Iranian service. Unfortunately, however, the General Staffs of both countries considered that flying by Turkish pilots to Tehran, or by Iranian pilots to Angora, would give too great facilities for espionage. The present proposal is therefore, I believe, that the Turks should fly only to Tabriz, and the Iranians to a point at some distance from Angora. The final stage in each case would be flown only by national pilots 5. Agreements for the improvement of ground communications between the two countries, the settlement of frontier difficulties and similar matters have, M. Husnu informs me, been successfully negotiated. 6. From a political point of view the prolonged visit of the Turkish mission must be regarded as a success. M. Husnu was, I think, an excellent selection for this task. He has been a very patient negotiator, and has accepted with good humour the Iranian habit of reopening questions which the other side had supposed to be finally settled. He has also entered with zest into such social distraction as Tehran affords and has, I think, made a very good impression generally. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Ove rsea Trade and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora. %29 m m ■Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, Ho 117-E dated the 27th March 1937. ‘ ’ With reference to my despatch No. 95 E. of 12th March (S. No 25) I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the detailed estimates of in ' V f f ° r l i 6 T®t r ' 131 n (2 r lst March 1937 t0 20th March 1938) published 'V Le Journal del eh eran ’ of 21st and 25th March. The totals of this bud- get show an increase of about 25 per cent on the previous year’s estimates. uJ' 0n , the T ev ® nu . e side an increase of 26,000,000 rials (£325,000) over Wnk Traao iXn 1 ? ate ex P ected from direct taxation and about 31,200,000 rials (£390,000) from indirect taxation. These increases are anticipated from axes already in force, not from new taxation to be introduced. The re- ceipts from Customs are expected to yield 62,000,000 rials (£775,000) more than last year s estimates. Estimated revenue from the tobacco, opium and cotton goods monopolies amounts to 50,000,000 rials (£625,000) : the cement ffononnoi e £P ected to produce an increase of 47,400,000 rials (nearly (£600,000). There are, however, various credits sanctioned in connection with these industries. An increased yield of 15,000,000 rials is expected from mines ; this presumably includes the increased sales of red oxide but Asarek S ° ' C connected wlth the development of copper and nickel ores at . , 3 - °? the expenditure side an increase of 40,000,000 rials (£500 000) is shown from the Ministry of War, the estimate this year, including the gen- darmine, amounting to 300,408,360 rials (about £3,867,600), a little over at sl^OOOOrf Wh w 6 bud 8 et - r A credit to help the sugar factories figures at 33,500,000 rials. No revenue from sugar factories is shown although all eight will be in operation. Most of them are probably running at a loss* An narfnfH, V ° te °/ 20 ? milllon ” al ® (£2,500,000) is provided in respect of that J ar of the construction payable in Iranian currency. . . ^^ expenditure on public Health remains unchanged, but a nro- vision of 5 000,000 rials is made for a hospital in Tehran. With more ade quate health services, including drainage and water canalization, there would ■ he less need for hospitals but m spite of the largely increased budget no money is apparently available for such essential services. There is a small increase of 4 000 000 rials (£50,000) in the Education estimates possibly to meet the cost of the evening classes for illiterate adults. 1 ^ •it 5 * ? h L e ^ imate for tile department of Mines has been raised from 12 million to 34,000,000 rials, probably largely on account of the Asarek develop 2 ments referred to in a preceding paragraph. Interesting new items under the estimates tor this department are the provision of 10 million rials (£125 0001 for a glycerine and soap factory and 9 million rials (£112, 500) for a factory to is dbscmre connection between these two projects and mining 6. Other expedinture items include an additional 5,000,000 rials for agriculture which does not suggest any striking new developments ; a further ririf(£ 5 () 10001 0 fn?^ rialS f ° r th6 C1 ^ arett f, and tobacco factory, and40,000,000 rials (£o0J,000) for remaining expenses”—presumably in addition to foreign ^^(wToon - /^?^^ stc ^°J r of seven grain mills. A further credit of 30,000,000 (£375,000) is allotted for the stabilization of grain prices, although the company set up last year to effect that stabilization is understood to be m liquidation. A credit of 70 million rials (£675,000) is provided for in sneci 7v e na£rm 1C - economic enterprises, and a further credit of 74 million rials port’ 7 ° U 18 ° n aCCOUnt of the ex P ensive dredger required for the Caspian , / cursory examination of the estimates would suggest a very health v state of things ; revenue increasing by 25 per cent without additional tax/- tion, a balanced budget, and a large share of the expenditure bein^ devoted to improving the economic equipment and resources of the country Until such time as the Iranian Government see fit to publish statements of actual 42(C) ExAffairsDept -130 revenue and expenditure during a given year, showing the surplus or de ficit carried forward, it is impossible to attach any real importance to the budget estimates solemnly submitted to and approved by the Majlis year by year. It is difficult to express any useful opinion on the financial condi tion of the country in the absence of any exact statistical information, but the opinion generally held is that the situation is far from being that suggested by the budget estimates and by the inspired comments of a strictly controlled local pi ess. 8. The national budget is usually accompanied, or rapidly followed by, a supplementary budget showing credits in sterling for the payment of foreign commitments. For the past few years this supplementary budget has con tained a credit of £2,000,000—approximately equal to the whole sum in res pect of royalties and taxation received from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, together with other considerable credits in respect of railway construction and equipment and other Government purchases. The oil royalties are usually described as being passed to the credit of the “ national reserve ”, but the acute shortage of foreign exchange which has prevailed for over a year suggests that the disproportion between the national reserve and imme diate national obligations is so great that all the ingenuity of the Iranian Government will not be able to balance the account without tapping some new source of supply. It is commonly thought that this new source of supply will take the form of a loan contracted abroad. 9. There is a strong rumour that Monsieur Fehimy, a former Minister of Finance and now Ambassador at Ankara, is being recalled and will be ap pointed to succeed Monsieur Davar. It is also said that anxious conferences are taking place at the Ministry of Finance attended by Monsieur Ala, the new Controller of Government Monopoly Companies, with the object of presenting a report on the financial situation and on proposed remedies to His Majesty the Shah when he returns from his visit to the Persian Gulf. Some of the Government monopolies created during the last year or so are not expected to survive the critical examination to which their affairs are likely to be sub jected. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas trade unnumbered, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 53 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 23. P. S .—As usual there are several mistakes in the Budget figures published, and the additions of the 1316 (this year’s) figures do not agree with the totals.

J. Seymour, Esq., C. M. G., C.V.O., His f —\ Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to H. L. Baggallay, Esquire, Foreign Office, London, dated the 9th April 1937. Making plans for the celebration of the Coronation has brought up the question of the boycott of our Consulates by the Persian authorities. We have, of course known for some time that only Governors, Chiefs of Police and Heads of Muncipalities can be expected to accept invitations to Consu lates, but we have now been told by Watkinson in Shiraz that he has seen an actual copy of the instructions sent to one of the local Government insti tutions. It read as follows :— “In accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior, on receipt of any invitation from foreign Consu lates or Consulates General, only Governors-General and Governors and Assistant Governors and Chiefs of Police and Chiefs of the Municipality have the right to be present. It is necessary that strict attention should be paid to these instructions ”. 2. In spite of the existence of this circular, we are advising any Consuls who consult us about asking Persian officials to Coronation celebrations, not to limit their invitations to those who are likely to accept, but to send them out to those whom they would normally have asked. If we confine our invitations to the few who are allowed to come, we may eventually be accused of not wanting to invite Persians. It therefore seems better to prove how ready we are to be friendly by sending out invitations to such persons as would be asked in a country where conditions in this respect were normal. (29) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 134-E., dated the 9th April 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 117-E. of March 27th last (S. No. 27) transmitting the budget estimates for the financial year 1937-38 (March 21st to March 20th), I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation from the Journal de Teheran of April 8th, of the supplementary budget law submitted to the Majlis by the Acting Minister of Finance. 2. The supplementary budget law contains fourteen articles, but only one of them appears to have any real importance. This is article 6, which provides from the “national reserves” a credit of £1,000,000 for railway cons- struction, as well as for a loan of 90,000,000 rials (£1,125,000) from the Banque Mellie for the same purpose. The Budget estimates, reported in my despatch under reference, contained a credit of 200 million rials (£2,500,000) for railway construction, the total estimated cost of which is thus £4,625,000 for the year. 3. The supplementary budget law is more remarkable for its omissions than for its content. No provision is made for the sterling requirements of of the armed forces, whereas for the past few years there has been a regular vote of £2,000,000. No provision is made for the large textile factories— to cost more than £1,000,000—for which tenders have been invited, nor for the four cement factories, nor for the canalization of Tehran’s water supply nor for the iron and steel plant for which offers have been invited. 4. It is impossible at the moment to say wdiether these omissions presage a period of strict economy, or whether it is hoped to raise funds by foreign loan or otherwise, for these purposes. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that, as the “ national reserves ” do not contain any appreciable funds, it was not considered possible to vote any appropriations from them. Further developments, in view of the critical financial situation in which the country now finds itself, will be awaited with interest. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, unnumbered, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 62 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 25. 42(Cj ExAffairsDept.'SSw* 1 40 ( 31 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 153/357-3-37, dated the 22fco April 1937. With reference to your despatch No. 70 (T 1687/1697/379) of the 17th February, I have the honour to report that I was to-day received in audience bv His imperial Majesty the Shah for the purpose of presenting my new credentials. His Imperial Majesty on receiving them expressed his best wishes for the health and prosperity of Their Majesties the King and Queen. 2. After the presentation of my credentials, His Imperial Majesty retain ed me for about twenty minutes of conversation, accompanied by tea and cigarrettes. Nothing remarkable passed but His Majesty showed (as he is fond of doin&lt;y ) that he was informed of my movements during a tour which I recently made in South Iran. He talked about the progress of the railway, part of which I had visited in the neighbourhood of Khorramabad and re ferred to the great importance of Iran being linked by rail with the outer world. The conversation was in fact on general lines and covered more or less the usual Tehran topics. 3. I should perhaps mention that the conversation at one point turned upon a carpet which His Imperial Majesty is sending to London for presen tation to The King, and which I had seen some days previously. I his carpet is a specimen of Modern Iranian work, in which the Shah takes a personal interest, and is from his own collection. While I cannot speak with any pre tention bo expert knowledge, the carpet appears to me a very fine example of the best modern Iranian product. 4. His Imperial Majesty’s attitude was friendly, and he gave the impres sion of being in good health, though possibly rather tired. I was told that he had in fact been somewhat fatigued by his recent journeys m the South. 5. I may note in conclusion that the audience took place in the new Pahlevi palace, which is now practically complete. The outside of this as tonishing structure is made of a greenish coloured marble, smoothed and •ind polished Of the interior I only saw the very simple office m which His Imperial Majesty receives, but I understand the state apartments are on a scale of magnificence to correspond with the exterior. The Shah has cer tainly equalled or surpassed his predecessors in the scale of his palace building. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 69. (32) Despatch feom His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 136-E. DATED THE 24TH APRIL 1937. 1 have the honour to report that, in accordance with a decision of the Council of Ministers, an Economic Council has been constituted for the so lution of the economic problems of the Empire.” An extract from the “ Journal de Teheran ” of April 16th, reporting this decision and gjYmg details as to the constitution and functions of the new body, is enclosed herewith. 2 The need for an organization to co-ordinate the economic activities of the various Government departments and monopoly companies is obvious, n A present confused economic and financial situation will provide im- mediate Surgent problems for the attention E—o ^ * The most interesting features in the constitution of the Council are the n elusion in its membership of three non-official persons, ouestions economdques ”, and of the president of the Council tor the super vision of Government companies (Monsieur Ala). It may be assumed that43 3. I am informed that owing to the high cost of coal, and expensive transport, the cement manufactured in this factory will be of little use except in the proximity of Tehran. Railway contractors are, in accordance with their contracts, entitled to purchase cement from Government stores at 400 rials (£5) per ton : the actual cost of production at the local factory is said to be considerably over this figure. The Japanese have delivered cement GIF Gulf port at about 28&lt;s. a ton. 4. There is no further news of the erection of the four new factories, the call for tenders for which was reported in my despatch No. (B) 184 of 16th October 1936. It is more than likely that the project has been postponed indefinitely on account of the financial crisis. The Soci6te GOierale de Con struction, which issued the call for tenders, has been liquidated. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India under No. C. 1. and the Commerical Secretary, British Embassy at Baghdad under No. C. 3, of todays’ date. ( 34 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 48-E/E. 31-2-37, DATED THE 8TH FEBRUARY 1937. With reference to your despatch No. 475 (E 7367/345/34) of 1st December last, and previous correspondence relating to conditions at Bandar Shahpur and at Khorramshahr since the fire at the Customs at the latter port, I have the honour to transmit herewith a note by the Commercial Secretary to this Legation on the congestion and confusion reported to exist at these two ports at the present time. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade No. 231/2/37 and to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire No. 10 and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz No. 10 in case the latter are able to supply additional information on this subject. p. —Since this despatch was drafted, I have been informed by the Tehran manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, who has just returned from Abadan, that the Iranian Government recently made an appeal to the Company to assist them in reducing the congestion. Asa result the company made arrangements to instal cranes and other necessary machinery and a few days ago the clearance of motor cars and spare parts was proceeding at satisfactory pace. Enclosure to S. No. 34. Note by the Commercial Secretary, British Legation, Tehran, on Congestion at Gulf ports. I was told yesterday that the congestion and confusion at Gulf ports is getting worse. One British steamer with cargo for Khorramshahr landed it all at Basra ; a German steamer after waiting for four days (at a cost of £80 per diem) reported that it would have to land its cargo elsewhere. At Bandar Shahpur where only one ship can come alongside at once, five were in port the other day. A report in to-day’s Journal de Teheran says that an Italian and German steamer were damaged at Bandar Shahpur during a sud den storm. Unloading facilities have changed little recently, though to day instead of the ordinary hand-hauled cases, huge pieces of machinery, Diesel engines etc., are daily being imported owing to railway construction and industrialisation. 2. At Khorramshahr fifty meter cars fell into the sea. Two lighters full of motor spare parts which had been waiting indefinitely to be unloaded, gradually filled with water and sank. Total losses are said to amount to 460,00 tomans (£50,000). The loss of spare parts is particularly important44 as I am told that one of the main reasons for the huge rise in transport rates is lack of tyres and spares which has resulted in many trucks being laid up. Of 800 motor vehicles which arrived at Khorramshahr in November, it is said that not more than 25 had been cleared up to a few days ago and a further large consignment is due shortly. During the last few months ad ditional lines (Japanese, Dutch-Java and American) have started regular services to the Gulf, which will certainly not help to relieve the existing con gestion. ( 35 ) (Received on 1st May 1937 with Political Secretary's Letter No. 15, dated the 15th April 1937.) Enclosure in Eoreiga Cffice covering letter No. (E. 1727/76/34), dated 13th April 1937. [P. Z. 2443/37]. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 77/231-7-37, dated the 27th February 1937. With reference to certain reports which are current regarding the navigation of the Karun, I have the honour to state that I have no information which would suggest that the Iranian Government are contemplating the closure of the Customs house at Ahwaz, or other immediate steps to divert traffic from the Karun to Bandar Shahpur, and the railway. The Iranian Govern ment are undoubtedly aware that Bandar Shahpur cannot possibly deal with the present volume of traffic, and it seems unlikely that they will be so foolish as to prevent traffic through Khorramshahr and the Karun route in the near future. I have however requested His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to pre pare a report on this question, and I shall not fail to inform you of his views in the light of local knowledge. If it should prove necessary to make any representations to the Iranian Government regarding the closure of the Ahwaz customs, I agree that representations based on treaty rights hold out little hope of success. The Iranian Government would certainly deny the pre sent validity of the 1903 Convention and would resent any suggestion that their right to open and close customs houses when and where they choose is in any way limited by treaty. I think therefore that any representations should be based on considerations of practical convenience. But as I have said, I have no reason to suppose that the closure of the Ahwaz customs house is proposed at present. 2. I have no special information regarding conditions at Bushire, bu^ I have no doubt that the congestion is due to the same causes at all the Gulf ports. There are two main causes (a) the fact that some of the various mono poly companies have made the mistake of ordering in single consignments the supplies which they need for a whole year’s working and (6) the difficulty of obtaining exchange to clear goods from the customs. Thus abnormally large quantities of goods have arrived at the Customs, which are already packed with others that cannot be cleared for lack of exchange. Storage space is hopelessly inadequate, and lighters must be used for storage and cannot be unloaded for weeks, so that they are not available for unloading ships. At Khorramshahr it has been necessary to bring lighters from Basrah at exorbitant rates of hire, and it seems clear that the same trouble has occur red at Bushire where there is no alternative source from which lighters can be obtained. 3. The Iranian Government are undoubtedly fully aware of this position^ and acutely embarassed by it. They are doing what they can to improve landing facilities at Khorramshahr, and are considering a modest scheme for improvements at Bandar Shahpur, which it should be possible to realise with out great delay. As reported in my despatch under reference, they have appealed to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to help them out of their diffi culties at Khorramshahr. The situation is indeed still most unsatisfactory. Nevertheless I do not think that anything would be gained by representationsto the Iranian Government. I fear that they would only be irritated by com plaints regarding conditions from which they are themselves suffering severe ly, and that they would not be spurred thereby to any greater efforts to im prove the position. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire No. 13 and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz No. 14, without enclosures. ( 36 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter (E. 2279/76/34), dated 4th May 1937. [P. Z. 3018/37]. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 133/151-14-37, dated the 9th April 1937. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz regarding the closure of the Ahwaz Cus toms. It will be seen that Mr. Gardener confirms the view expressed in my despatch No. 77 of the 27th February (S. No. 35) that it is most unlikely that the Customs at Ahwaz will be closed at any time in the near future. 2. While this is satisfactory, it is to be feared that the difficulties of Britsh shipping companies due to congestion at the Gulf ports and to the action of the local port and customs authorities, are not likely to decrease. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a further despatch from Mr. Gardener, which shows that despite the assistance of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, there had been no appreciable improvement in the situation by the beginning of March. Further difficulties have been caused by the restriction of the conveyance of cargo from ship to shore at Khorramshahr to a local Iranian Company which is most inadequately equipped to carry out this work. The position with regard to this question is at present somewhat obscure, and I propose to defer reporting in full on this subject until the completion of futher enquiries which I am making. Enclosure 1 to S. No. 36. Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, to His Majesty’s Minis ter, Tehran, No. 23, dated the 5th March 1937. I I have the honour to forward the following information in implification of my despatch No. 9 of the 26th January. 2. A reliable report states that in the Customs at Khorramshahr three hundred thousand packages are lying unprotected from damage by sun, rain or pilferage while in Ahwaz there are fourteen thousand. A similar state of affairs is known to exist in Bandar Shahpur where no warehouse accomodation exists and a quantity of wheat awaiting shipment has been considerably damaged. 3. In neither Khorramshahr, Bandar Shahpur nor Ahwaz is there a proper Customs house or warehouse facilities. Barges are used as storehouses and the number of barges being limited, landing charges have increased enormously. Barges are being hired from Basra at Prohibitive charges wdiile a cargo of cement at Bandar Shahpur had recently to be unloaded by transhipment into small boats (bellums). 4. Apparently strong representations have been made to the Central authorities by the Customs and proper accommodation has been promised. Considerable time must elapse in any case before this can be provided. 5. The same source stated that the Ahwaz Customs House would be built at once and that Ahwaz would eventually become the provincial centre for Khuzistan Customs. 42(C) Ex Affairs Dept6. In amplification of the postscript of your despatch under reference I would add that the late Davar requested the help of the Company in assem * bling motor vehicles. This was agreed to by the Company in return for payment of Rials 40,000 a month (please see Ahwaz diary for January I937J! paragraph 4). The accumulation of motor vehicles is however only factor of congestion. Other goods, notably tea etc., continue to accumulate as a result of the monopoly system, the shortage of ready cash to pay duties*’ delays in granting import licences and finally the ineptitude of the Custnma Administration. ^usuums 7.

Telegram from Sir P. Loraine, Istanbul, to the Foreign office, Lon don, No. 25, dated the 1st May, 1937. Important. Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me he showed confi dentially to Turkish Government draft of a treaty between Iraq and Iran relating to frontier between the two countries (text of which I understand from him had received prior approval of His Majesty’s Government) which he had handed to Iranian Minister Bagdad two days ago before his departure for Angora. He says Turkish Government were most favourably impressed with this document which they regarded as a sound and statesmanlike effort on the part of Iraqi Government to settle frontier difficulties with Iran. Further more that Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs impressed Turkish views to foregoing effect on Iranian Ambassador at Angora and requested latter to send a pressing personal appeal from President of the Republic to the Shah urging His Majesty to effect an early settlement with Iraq and suggesting that draft in question offered an excellent basis for so doing. Iranian Ambassador telegraphed accordingly to Tehran before depar ture to Angora of Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. Addressed to Foreign Office No. 25 of May 1st ; repeated to Bagdad and Tehran.

I I have the honour to inform you that I am leaving this post, on transfer to Moscow, on 16th May. From that date until the arrival of my successor this Commercial Secretariat will be in charge of Mr. F.A.G. Gray, who will sign despatches as Acting Commerical Secretary.48 ( 41 ) Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Teheran, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 202 (72/48 /37), dated the 5th June 1937. I have the honour to inform you that on the 12th May the Coronation of Their Majesties was duly celebrated in Tehran and by His Majesty’s Con sular Officers throughout Iran. 2. At Tehran the Bishop in Persia, who had come from Isfahan for the purpose, took the special Order of Service in the Church lent for the occasion by the American Mission. My Staff and I attended in uniform. For rea sons of space and to enable as many as possible of the British and British- Indian community to be present, invitations were not sent either to Iranians, the Diplomatic Body or other non-British persons. This was ex plained in advance to the head of the Protocol Department ; the Church was well filled, no British subjects had to be turned away, and some of the American community also attended the Service. 3. In the early afternoon many were able to listen on the Wireless to the Coronation Service in Westminister Abbey, held by the Souvenir pro gramme some 200 copies of which had been sold at one toman (2/6d) a copy. Reception was good by Tehran standards, the presentation of His Majesty by the Archbishop, and His Majesty’s responses being clearly audible. Sub sequently I gave a Garden Party in the Legation garden in Tehran, to which British and British Indian Subjects and a few other persons were invited. 4. In the evening, I invited a large number of Iranians, both official and unofficial, the whole of the Diplomatic Body and many British and other leading residents to a Ball. Out of some 250 Iranians invited approximately 140 were present, including ladies in what appeared to be the normal Euro pean proportion. After discreet sounding invitations were not issued to any member of the Imperial family. The members of the Italian Legation as I have reported elsewhere, received instructions on the morning not to take part in the Coronation celebrations and consequently absented themselves sending no explanation. But they were almost effusively friendly at a Roumanian function on the following day. The Ball guests, and not least the Iraninians, demonstrated great friendliness and desire to share in our day of national pride and rejoicing. 5. His Majesty’s Consular Officers gave similar entertainment. Mr. Squire at Meshed received some 250 guests at a Garden Party, namely Bri tish and British Indians, and a fifth of this number at a subsequent Ball. In Khuzistan, where the British Communities are much larger, programmes were ambitious and carried out with uniform success. Notable features were the presence of the General Officer Commanding, General Muini, to whom I have referred in previous despatches, and his wife at an aftc rnoon Gymkhi na. The General, in spite of illness in his family, stayed for a considerable tin e, enabling Mr. Gardener to have a very friendly conversation with him. At Khorramshahr the British and Indian communities vied in athletic loyalty and in generosity. No less than £400 were collected for the King George V Fund and Viceregal Charities. I have reason to know how much the fore sight and energy of Captain Bazalgette was responsible for this satisfactory showing. 6. Apart from loyalty and grateful satisfaction among His Majesty’s Subjects, undoubtedly and inevitably in Iran as it is to-day the other princi pal feature of the Coronation celebrations was the participation or non participation of Iranian nationals ; and indeed the occasion threw a good deal of further light on what may be termed the boycott. 7. Several of His Majesty’s Consular Officers had consulted me in advance as to how widely they should issue invitations. As already reported semi-officially, I instructed them, regardless of the improbality of receiving acceptances, to invite all those persons, official, military or private, whom they could'properly and naturally ask to join in our national day of rejoicing. These instructions were acted on and reports now receive show that inn i 49 almost every case the Governor or his deputy referred to Tehran for instruc tions, enquiring whether any relaxation was to be made in the existing ruling as regards visits to His Majesty’s Consulates. No relaxation was permitted ; further it was made clear to more than one of our Consular Officers that only four officials were permitted to attend such functions, namely the Governor- General or Governor and his Deputy, the Chief of Police and the Chief of the Municipality. General Muini and Colonel Bayendor were exceptions to this ruling which was otherwise rigidly obeyed. No attempt to deny its existence was made by anyone except Monsieur Pakravan in Meshed who confirmed on this occasion his reputation for unfriendliness and mendacity. His deputy at Meshed implicitly confirmed, but permitted a relaxation of the “ commercial ” boycott which virtually prevents local trademen from visiting the Consulate-General ; and at Shiraz it transpired that the Consulate may only be visited by permission of the Chief of the Police. In these circumstan ces the entertainments given by His Majesty’s Consular Officers were attended by few Iranians except the Officials named, and these few were drawn usually from big businesses including the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Iran. As regards my own Ball there were definitely more Ministers and others present than at a private Ball that I had given in the winter. 8. I feel it only right to repeat that the apparent unfriendliness is “by or( j er ”—many Consular Officers confirm that it is not by inclination—and that it is universally applied to foreign Consulates. It is also a fact that great interest, frankly coloured by admiration, was shown in the Coronation, in photographs of the Ceremony, in the anticipated film, in the Monarchy and the present Sovereign, and in London and what it stands for. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department No. 91. ( 42 ) Enclosure in Foreign [P. Z. 3048/37]. Office covering letter No. (K 14140/14146/293), dated 6th May 1937. Code telegram from Foreign Office, London, to Mr. Brickell, (Basra), No. 3, DATED THE 21ST DECEMBER 1936. It is understood that the Vice-Consulate at Abadan Reach is being closed from December 24th to January 1st inclusive, arrangements being made to deal with urgent business on payment of “ holiday fees ”. Please inform Vice-Consul that such closure is irregular and that “ holiday fees” may be charged only in strict accordance with the terms of fee 96. Enclosure 1 to S. No. 42. Letter from the Foreign Office, London, to His Majesty’s Consul, Basra, No. 65, dated the 31st December 1936. With reference to Foreign Office telegram No. 3 of the 21st December regarding the alleged proposal to levy of Fee 96 irregularly at His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Abadan, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request that you will in due course furnish a report on this matter. Enclosure 2 to S. No. 42. letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Basra, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 2, dated the 13th January 1937. With reference to your telegram No. 3 of December 21 regarding the irregular levy of fee No. 96 at the Vice-Consulate at Abadan Reach, I have the honour to report as follows :— On November 5 Captain Bazalgette, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Kor- ramshahr addressed a circular letter to the various Shipping firms at Abadan50 to the effect that in future the Shipping Office would close on Fridays and open on Sundays. This was brought to my attention about December 5. I asked Captain Bazalgette whether there was any authority or precedent for ^ this change and as he said there was not I requested him to report the matter in an official despatch copy of which I enclose herewith. On the receipt of your telegram No. 3 I communicated the contents to Captain Bazalgette, who there ipon gave the necessary instructions that the Shipping Office would only close on December 24 and 25 and January 1 as in past years. I explained to him that no changes in office hours should be made until I had obtained a decision from you on the subject. I enclose herewith copies of a despatch and of a semi official letter from him explain ing the reasons why he had proposed to close the office from December 24 January 1. It will be noted that he only followed the practice instituted by his predecessor, which presumably was never reported to this office or to you. In view of Captain Bazalgette’s representations I have the honour to recommend that the necessary sanction may be given for the Shipping Office to close on Fridays instead of Sundays and to observe all Iranian gazet^ ted holidays. Enclosure 3 to S. No. 42. Letter from the British Vice-Consul, British Consular Shippino Office, Abadan Reach, to His Majesty’s Consul, Basra, No. 513/1 DATED THE 31ST DECEMBER 1936. [K 1411/1411/293]. Would you please refer to your D. O. Letter No. 2379 of the 23rd Decem ber, 1936 and our conversations regarding the Holidays of the Abadan Shipp ing Office ? I enclose two memoranda giving my point of view and opinions and hop© you will agree with me. I think I should point out that my position as Vice-Consul at Khorram- shahr and Vice-Consul at Abadan Reach is probably unique. The Vice- Consul at Khorramshahr under the supervision of the Consul at Ahwaz is recognised by the Iranian Government and his district includes abadan. From the Iranian point of view, the Abadan Shipping Office is a branch of the Khorramshahr Vice-Consulate, to facilitate the “ internal routine of British ships ”, and that that office is subordinate to you is unkown to them. It is to be noted, too, that for administrative purposes the Khorramshahr office is subordinate to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India, and therefore, observes the holidays gazetted by the Government of India. Enclosure 4 to S. No. 42. Memorandum from the British Vice-Consul, British Consular Shipping Office, Abadan Reach, to His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, No. 514/1 DATED THE 31 ST DECEMBER 1936. Friday is the Official Holiday in Iran and all Government Offices, Banks and Firms, whether Iranian or Foreign, close on Fridays. I think I am right in saying that British Consular Offices close too on that day. Certainly the Consulate-General at Bushire and the Consulates at Kerman and Bandar Abbas do. However it is more convenient for British Subjects to consult me at the Khorramshahr Vice-Consulate on their private affairs on their weekly holiday rather than on a working day. Also as the Indian and Bushire Mail arrives on Thursday, by working on Friday, it can be asnwered by return post. My Khorramshahr Office therefore remains open on Fridays. This is purely an arrangement for the convenience of the British Subjects and the- efficiency of that Office.51 % d&amp;J 51 2. Abadan is in practice a private port of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Iranian authorities allow no passengers or goods, other than for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, to land there. The ships dealt with in the Abadan Shipping Office are tankers loading Oil Fuels and Merchant ships belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Frank C. Strick bringing material for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Abadan Shipping Office deals with no ships unconnected with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 3. Ships however, do not observe holidays or office hours and between 4 and 6 ships arrive at or leave Abadan daily, Fridays and Sundays included. The work is so heavy that I do not think there is a holiday in the year on which the services of the Shipping Office are not called for, and the working days are few on which these services are not required after office hours. In fact the situation is such that it is not a question of which day the clerks will have a complete holiday, but on which day Fee No. No. 96 will be charged in what would otherwise be “ Office Hours Following are the sums collec ted during 1936 (other than under Fees 95 and 96) on Fridays and on Sundays, which shows that there is but little difference between the pressure of work on either day bearing in mind that the amount collected on Sundays is for Urgent Work and that collected on Fridays is for routine work :— SUNDAYS £43-13-6. FRIDAY £94-13-0. 4. A fair consideration should, I think, be given to the clerks. If they work on Fridays when the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Offices are closed and routine work is slack they may well be wasting their time, with little work other than urgent matters to deal with whereas on their Sunday holiday they may be called upon for urgent work and find it to be routine. Again on their Sunday holiday their friends are at work. If they take a Friday holiday, they will not be called upon except for urgent matters since the Anglo-Ira- nian Oil Company Offices are closed and further they are able to make that kind of personal friendship with the Company’s staff which goes a long way to smooth over the minor difficulties which may well arise between Govern ment servants and servants of a large firm. I am of opinion, therfore, that the Abadan Shipping Office should be closed on Fridays and if you have no objection, I propose continuing this arrangement. &gt; Enclosure 5 to S. No. 42. Memorandum from the British Vice-Consul, British Consular Shipp ing Office, Abadan Reach, to His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, No. 575/1, DATED THE 31ST DECEMBER 1936. When the duties of the Acting British Vice-Consul, Abadan Reach were performed by the Assistant Port Officer, the Iraq Government gazetted holi days were observed. These, as regards Christmas, were Christmas day. Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. 2. On the transfer of the Shipping Office to the shore in February, 1933 and the appointment of the Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr as Vice-Consul, Abadan Reach, subordinate to the Consul at Basrah, the custom arose for the Shipping Office to conform to the Khorramshahr Vice-Consulate hours. 3. As the Shipping Office is in no way administered by the Government of India but by the Consulate Basrah, I can see no justification for this. How ever Christmas Holidays on the Indian Scale i.e., 24th December to 1st Janu ary were observed in 1934 and 1935 and fee No. 96 was charged without comp laint by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.4. The following sums were collected under Fee No. 96 in what would otherwise have been office hours on the days other than Official British Bank Holidays during the the Christmas Holidays : 1934 £3-6-6. 1935 £5-14-0. Although the sum involved is small I do not think it can be justified. The Shipping Office is for the convenience of British Shipping Companies and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and should, I consider, observe the Official Iranian Bank Holidays. I am asking the Imperial Bank of Iran for a list of the Iranian Gazetted Holidays, and if you agree, will arrange for the Shipping Office to conform to them. Enclosure 6 to S. No. 42. Letter from the Foreign Office, London, to The Secretary, British Tanker Company, Limited, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, dated the 27th February 1937. With reference to your conversation by telephone with this department on the 19th December, 1936, regarding the proposed closure of the Shipping Office at Abadan Reach during the Christmas holidays, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you that the office was closed only on the 24th and 25th December and on the 1st January. Enclosure 7 to S. No, 42. Letter from the Foreign Office, London, to His Majesty’s Consul, Basra, No. 27, dated the 1st April 1937. With reference to your despatch No. 2 of 13th January last concerning holidays to be observed at the Vice-Consulate at Abadan Reach, I am direc ted by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you may authorise His Majesty’s Vice- Consul to close the Shipping Office on Fridays instead of Sundays. Before the question of whether all Iranian gazetted holidays may be oberved is decided it is desired that you should furnish this Department with a list of such holidays. GlPD—42{C) EjtAffftirtDepk—S 2—9-9-37—30.53 ( 43 ) [Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated SOth April 1937.) Lettee feom the British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 127/317/8/37, dated the 5th April 1937. With reference to your despatch No. 68 (W. 2623/2391/50) of the 17th Feb ruary, I have the honour to inform you that Captain Yon Blomberg and Captain Yon Sternberg arrived in Tehran from Baghdad in their Junkers aeroplane on the 9th March and left for Kabul on the 11th March. During their short stay in Tehran it was not possible for them to accept any hospitality in His Majesty’s Legation, but they found time to call on Mr. Butler and expressed their gratitude for the assistance given them at Baghdad, thanks to Group Captain Don’s recommenda tion of them. 2. His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman has reported that on the return flight the aeroplane landed at Bandar Abbas on the 21st March. It had flown from Kabul to Jask. Water was supplied to the aeroplane from the Consulate and it left for Damascus after an hour’s stay. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Berlin, No. 317/8/37. ( 44 ) [Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 13th May 1937.) Letter from Mr. Seymour, to Mr. Eden, No. 131, dated the 26th April 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 38 of the 26th January, I have the honour to inform you that on the 15th March the Iranian and Turkish representa tives signed in Tehran six conventions concluded as the result of the protracted negotiations which had taken place in Tehran since the arrival of the Turkish dele gation in October last. According to an announcement in the Journal de TeUran of the 16th March, these conventions dealt with the following subjects : [a) Frontier security. {h) Extradition. [c) Judicial assistance. [d) Residence. [e) Customs tariff (tnis convention is described as a ^ convention douaniere unique ”). (/) Telegraphs and telephones. 2. The texts of the six conventions have not yet been published, and little or nothing is known about their provisions. I understand from Mr. Husnu, who is now at last confidently expecting to leave Tehran, that they do not amount to much. Before leaving he hopes to sign certain further agreements, including a commercial treaty, the negotiation of which was finished some time ago, but which have not, he tells me, yet been finally approved by the Iranian Government. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, unnumbered, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Angora, No. 184. ( 45 ) [Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 39th April 1917.) Despatch from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 124 (166/8/37), dated the 1st April 1937. His Majesty’s Representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit here- with, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of Policital Reports from Consulates:— Despatch No. 5 from His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.Enclosure I to Serial No. (45). Letter from the British Consulate. Shiraz, to the British Legation, Tehran, No. 5, dated the 6th February 1937. With reference to Mr. Butler’s circular despatch No. 6 (232/3/36) of L5fch Feb ruary 1936, and to Mr. Gault’s despatch No. 25, of 18th November last, I have the honour to transmit copy of a Summary of Events and Conditions in Fars during the year 1936. 2. The report is based upon the monthly diaries of this Consulate and upon other reports submitted by my predecessors at this post and is prepared annually at the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. The summary contains sections on agriculture and on economic affairs, and it covers much of the ground suggested for further survey in your circular des patch No. 5 of 16th January (119/1/37). It is unlikely that more material will come to hand for another report before I go to Isfahan, as I am proposing to do soon after the No Rouz. Any items of economic information thought to be of interest will continue to be reported in my monthly diary. Enclosure II to Serial No. (45). Summary of Events and Conditions in the Province of Ears during THE YEAR 1936. General situation. L The situation has remained quiet and the Central Government has conti nued to extend its influence in the economic development of the Province. Few visitors of importance have been seen in Shiraz during the year 1936. The Minister of Finance left early in January, promising to consider measures for the improve ment of agriculture, trade communications, irrigation and the system of collection of taxes, and a new era of propsperity was to dawn in which air-mail, Government aid in all trading ventures, and the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the Pro vince would play their part. So far nothing has materialised of all this except for an order for two hundred carpets for use in Government offices in Tehran which rumour has it have not been paid for. 2. The population of Fars is now said to exceed 400,000 of these, 200,000 are tribesmen, 80,000 settled in Villages, and 120,000 in Shiraz. The population of the town has increased in the last few years as people arrive from outlying districts to seek for work. Much of the otherwise idle population has been set to work on the building of barracks and military installation on which 50,000,000 rials are said to have been spent. 3. In spite of the considerable wealth of numbers of the Shirazis, progress has been slow in those things which are held in account to-day in Iran. Tnbal dis turbances of former years have led to disfavour in the eyes of Government and consequent lack of attention and support. 4. The visit of His Majesty the Shah to Shiraz, accompanied by the Valiahd was awaited from the summer up to the end of the year without great enthusiasm. The Army practised organised cheering in order that suitably spontaneous welcome might be given to him. The Municipal authorities at one time showed feverish activity in the preparation of roads and beautification of the approaches to the town, but it was given out that no money was to be spent on decoration, doubtless to the great relief of shopkeepers and others on the route. 5. As the Government enters more and more deeply into the every day life of the people, the protection afforded from the attentions of former Governors or tribal leaders is outweighed by the nuisance of restrictions. The Shah is probably held responsible for this and is feared accordingly, while respect due for his organis ing ability has been largely lost as it is felt that all the wealth of the country is being attracted to the Capital. The policy of industrial development is, however, realised to be of advantage to the Province of Fars which now has a lucrative outlet for production of cotton for the spinning mills of Isfahan and Shiraz and of beet for the sugar factory situated 25 miles to the North of Shiraz, which is producing supplies for local use. 6. The Qawam-ul-Mulk’s son married the Shah’s younger daughter during the year. Though some of Qawam’s supporters hope for some advantage from the union, it is regarded as an indication of Imperial designs on property in Fars.55 'ZJ’r 7. The principal Provincial officials at present have connections in the h’gh- est quarters and little local sympathy. A new Governor General arrived early in the year, who is related to one of the Shah’s wives. His cousin is in charge of the Finance Department. The Director of the Municipality is a brother of one of the highest officials in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The General Officer in command of the troops, who wields the highest influence in the Province, has now held the post for several years. None of these officials has any personal interest in Shiraz or in the Province. 8. Foreign residents are still apt to be treated with suspicion by local officials, though an outward semblance of friendship is maintained. But officials in general and notables are prohibited from dealings with the Consulate. No incidents have occurred during the year in which foreign subjects were involved. 9. The attempt at westernisation of the country has proceeded vigorously in Shiraz. Following on the imposition of European dress on dwellers in town and village, the unveiling of women has been accomplished almost universally and with surprising absence of disturbance. The “ chuddur ” is practically never seen in the streets of Shiraz now. Shuch women as object, mostly of the older generation, keep to their houses. Any opposition which there may have been seems to have died down. Early in the year receptions were given at which officials and members of guilds and trades paraded with their wives. Public baths and conveyances were closed to veiled women, but the example set by the womenfolk of the large garrison did much to effect the change amongst the civilian population. 10. There are still a good many mullahs to be seen about in turban and abba but the number has been reduced. Their influence and prestige seems for the pre sent to have disappeared with the transfer of many of their functions to other ad ministrative departments and the prohibition of public religious observances such as muharrem processions and public prayers. 11. The attention of the younger generation has been turned to athletics, foot ball and other outdoor games. A Boy Scout troop, 700 strong, has been organised in Shiraz which received the visit of colleagues from Isfahan towards the close of the year. Military drill has been taught to the senior members of the High School by instructors from the local barracks. Tribal affairs. 12. Nothing of note has occurred during the year amongst the Qashgai or Khamseh tribes. At the end of the year there were rumours of restlessness amongst the Boir Ahmedi of Kuhgilu, who resent the activities of the authorities to settle the tribes in defined areas. Very little progress has been made as yet in actual settlement except at Tul-i-Khosrau where buildings have been put up as permanent swellings for nomad settlers. The tribes are all controlled under military governors, but much migration still takes place at the usual seasons. The economic conse quences of complete prohibition are doubtless realised. 13. Hoad Guard services have been extended still more during the year and security exists on all the main roads, except for occasional incidents in remoter districts. 14. The Qawam-ul-Mulk has married his eldest son to a daughter of the Shah. It is believed that they may take up residence in Shiraz. The Qawam himself together with many of his near relatives and those of the late Saulet-ed-Douleh continues to live in Tehran. 15. The Qawam’s Munshi bashi, a wealthy man, who disappeared in 1935 and was given out to have been murdered or to have committed suicide, is believed to be in prison in Tehran. His house at Shiraz was taken over by the Governor General for use as his headquarters. Local administration. 16. The five members of the Mejliss for Fars continue to be Mohammed Mehdi Namazian (formerly Namazi), Hadlji Ghulam Hussein Malek, Mohammed Taqui Shankai Shirazi, Ahmed Kawami and Hadji Seyyed Abu Taleb Kazeruni. 17. His Excellency Abul Fath Doulatshahi arrived early in the year as Gover nor General of Fars, his predecessor having been appointed Minister of Communica tions. He was previously for many years Governor of Tehran. He is less popular in the Province and less energetic than his predecessor, while his personal debts56 and habits do not enhance the respect due to his position. Action has been taken against him in the Courts by his creditors and complaints against his grasping tendencies have gone to Tehran. He incurred unpopularity, the Shirazi being a lover of art, by ordering the removal of the old Quran Gate at the entrance to Shiraz from Isfahan, which has been a well-known landmark for centuries. He has made many empty promises to the merchant community regarding the im provement of roads, joining up with the Trans-Iranian railway system, and the financing of agricultural schemes. Though a connection of the Kajar family, he is related to one of the Shah’s wives and owes his position to rank and influence. Soon after his arrival, the Governor General visited the Kazerun, Fasa and Lar districts. Since then he has never undertaken another tour in the Province except for private amusement with his gun. 18. Dealings between the Consulate and the Governorate General have been confined throughout the year to routine matters and have been friendly. 19. Apart from the Deputies mentioned above, no official visitors of import ance came to Shiraz during the year. Members of the Government appear to have lost interest in Pars. Exceptions were Sar Lashkar Jehanbani, Head of the Department of Industry, and Aqai Bayet, Head of the Department of Agriculture who both visited the cotton factory at Shiraz and the sugar refinery at Merv Dasht in the Spring and toured the Province. Most of the Provincial heads of departments on the other hand went to Tehran at some time or other during the year. 20. Local officials have done little to attract the attention of the Consulate. Most of the Directors of Departments remain the same, the only changes being in the Police Department and in the Census Department. 21. The Municipality all through the year has been under the direction of Aqa Soheily, brother of a high official in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs who has been mentioned as a possible future Iranian Minister in London. He appears to share the unpopularity of the Governor General and for similar reasons. His deal ings with the public leave much to be desired. The year 1936 saw a large slice cut through the middle of the Bazar-i-Yakil as part of the scheme for carrying the Khiaban-i-Zand through from north to south of the town. After much demoli tion work was stopped for lack of father funds : so a large part of the Bazaar re mains in ruins and is a collecting place for water and malarial mosquitos. The Khiaban has also been continued for some miles south of the town and several houses built, mostly for the use of military and civil officials. This is said to be the beginning of a through road to Ahwaz. The road from Isfahan has been widen ed at the entrance to Shiraz (the discomfiture of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which has had to modify its plans for erecting a new depot by “ arrangement ” with the Director of the Municipality after prolonged negotiations), and the old Quran Gate, which was alleged to impede traffic, has been removed by dynamite, for it was found impracticable to transfer it piecemeal to another site, as had been intended. As the traffic is in any event stopped by the Police close to the site of the Gate, it is not appreciated why its removal was necessary. Its main crime seems to have been its antiquity. The thousand-year old quran which it housed has been placed in the local Museum. An ornamental almond and fruit garden has been laid out near the site of the Gate. The Imperial Bank of Iran has had to postpone the erection of a new building as land bought for the purpose has been cut in two by the municipal road-making schemes. 22. The road to the Tomb of Hafiz has been re-made and work is in progress on a road to the Tomb of Sa’adi. The reconstruction of the entire enclosure of the Tomb of Hafiz has been commenced and the Education Department is building an expensive granite monument with a gallery of twenty columns. A large ceme tery in the same neighbourhood is being laid out as a public garden, the headstones being used for making terraces. 23. A site has been purchased in the town for a new Municipal Hospital. An Orphanage, arrangements for which were made by the late Governor General, was opened during the year by the Municipality. Beggars are again on the increase. 24. The Chief of the Provincial Police was dismissed in the summer for corrupt practices along with the Chief of the Town Police. His successor died shortly after his arrival. The present Chief of Police is a courteous and pleasant indivi dual, transferred from Hamadan. He is very interested in traffic control and exer- cies efficient control in the Bazaars. Burglaries have been less prevalent during 1936 than in former years and the discipline of the Force seems to be good.57 25. The Finance Department has been in charge of a cousin of the Governor General throughout the year. The visit of the Minister of Finance at the close of • 1936 has had little effect in Fars, as few of his promises have been carried into effect. The Agricultural Taxes have been collected unremittingly all through the year. The Opium Monopoly Office has had a quiet year owing to partial failure of the crops and towards the end of the year it was announced that cultivations of opium poppies was to be stopped and cotton to be grown in its place under the direction of the Cotton Monopoly Company. 26. No new Public Works have been put in hand during the year. One of the main avenues through Shiraz has been continued westwards as far as Masjid-i- Bardi to form the commencement of a through road to Ahwaz. When it was an nounced that the visit or the Shah was to be expected, patching operations were begun on the Isfahan road. Various unmetalled roads were made in the Merv Dasht plain to facilitate collection of beet for the new sugar factory. 27. Spasmodic work was done on the Shiraz-Bushire road. As machinery for the new factories is being brought into the country by Bushire to avoid the con gestion of Khorromshahr, it will be necessary to keep the road in a better state of repair and possibly the problem of crossing the“ Mashileh ” may be tackled. But in the meanwhile the road is steadily deteriorating as is evidenced by the fact that the general rate of hire for motor transport from Bushire to Shiraz is double that on other roads in Iran. The road was inspected early in the year by the Director of the Boad Department of the Ministry of Communications. 28. The Postal Services continued to function slowly but reasonably surely. An office was opened at Takht-i-Jamshid (Persepolis) in the jsummer. The long talked of air mail service from Tehran seems to have been postponed indefinitely and the existing aerodrome after a considerable sum of money had been spent on its improvement was decided by a joint commission of military officers and officials from the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs to be unsuitable. Military opinion was against its use for any purpose in co-operation with civil authority. Telegraph services are reported to be very inadequate, largely through lack of staff. 29. The Agricultural Department is now largely concerned with the opera tions of the new Government Companies for trade in cotton, skins, wheat, dried fruits, etc. The opium crop having been unsatisfactory and Government having decided to limit production, large areas have been planted with cotton and wheat. The total area under cultivation in Fars is said to be about 600,000 hectares. Last year s crop of cotton amounted to 6 million kilogrammes, while 300,000 kilos of opium were produced. Government buyers did not take the whole stock of opium, but cotton found a ready market for the mills of Isfahan and Shiraz. Supplies of cotton for Russia are also required, as commitments have not been fulfilled. In creased quantities have been planted in the Kazerun and Abadeh areas. Cotton ginning plant has been installed at Kazerun and Mamessani, and is on crder for Shiraz. Abadeh, Fasa and Jehrum. 30. The Government Grain purchasing organisation bought supplies in the Pro vince and it is said that it is to be sold back to buyers for private use at a lower price m order to assist in recovery from the dislocation consequent on the huge loss of revenue from opium. Temporary grain stores holding 120,000 kharvars (about 34.000 tons) have been erected. They are believed to be half full. A credit of 1.300.000 nals is reported to be available for the construction of Grain Silos by Russian engineers, as in other parts of the country. 31. Rice growing has been prohibited in the district and attempt made with small success to grow cotton instead. 82. Sufficient beetroot was produced locally to supply the want of the refinery at Merv Dasht which started work in October. By the 'end of the year excellent sugar was on the market at a price slightly lower than imported Russian su^ar. Inere was talk of erecting a second factory at Fasa. 33. b ruit trees in parts of the Province were reported in the Spring to be suffer ing from blight. Unsually cold weather was experienced early in December which will probably have affected the crop of oranges and citrous fruit. 34. Government experts have reported favourably on projects for sinking artasian wells in connection with irrigation schemes. So far nothing has been done. MC184EAD—r 58 35. At the end of the year a system of sanitary inspection of animals was ap proved for the whole of Iran. Cattle disease is very prevalent in Ears. 36. There is nothing to report regarding judicial affairs, the Census Departs • ment, nor the Registration Department. Tiie Education Department has been busv under the direction of an cx-Army Officer. The Shahpur Boys High School has been extended and a new school opened at Kazerun. A School of Arts and ^ Crafts with two German instructors were also started in Shiraz. Night classes for adults and weekly lectures have been instituted. On the whole there is a better standard of teachers to-day and pay has improved. A “ Museum of Education ” was opened in the old “ Kolah Faranghi ” building in the Citadel, which lias been restored. Military affairs. 37. The 7th (Ears) Division, under Sartip Ibrahim Zandieh, has been increased to a total strength of over 10,000 men. More barracks have been under construc tion throughout the year. The French Military Mission paid a visit to Ears in the Spring. It was rumoured that the Vaiiahd was to assume command in South Iran, probably with Headquarters at Shiraz. A large new building for Military Head quarters has just been completed. The General Officer in Command has twice visited Bushire and the Gulf Ports during the year. In October the whole garrison was inspected by Sar Lashkar Murteza Yazdan Paneh. At the end of the year the General twice had to go to Ear in connection with trouble between the Amnieh and local tribes. He is an energetic and efficient officer. 38. The Amnieh have also been increased in numbers and new posts opened. They were inspected in the summer by Sartip Ghulam Ali Zand, Officer in Command of Road Guards for Iran, who included the Gulf Ports in his itinerary. On the whole the force appears to be efficient and discipline is maintained, though there were various rumoured irregularities in the Ear district at the end of the year when an officer and several men were arrested for contraband operations. 39. Unrest in Laristan and amongst the Boir Ahmedi tribes has necessitated visits by the General Officer in Command of the Ears Division and of the Officer in Command of Amnieh. Little seems to have been done during the year by the various Military Governors to speed up settlement of the tribes. Building continues at Tul-i-Khosrau, but it will be difficult to persuade the Kuhgilu tribes men to settle there in any numbers. Economic affairs. 40. The merchant class in general is dissatisfied with restrictions on trade and the intervention of Government as a trader. This particularly affects the export trade of Ears, which is passing into the hands of various Companies which mono polise trade. Exchange Control also has come into force under which the official buying rate for sterling was fixed at 80 rials to the £ and purchase of foreign cur rency could only be effected by Banks on behalf of the Exchange Control Commis sion in Tehran, while sales were only under Government permits issued by the Com mission after long delays. This has had detrimental effect on the foreign exchange turnover of Bans and it has seriously effected all import business. 41. Silver coinage has been out of circulation for most of the year. Owing to the restriction on foreign trade, Banks report that current account deposits have increased considerably. Some of the surplus has been invested in trading compa res and industrial enterprises. 42. No new taxes have been introduced during the year, but a new Customs Tariff contained several increases including charges on motor vehicles, import and working of which has become a Government monopoly. This has not reduced the cost of services to the public, while both new and second-hand cars have increased in price. 43. Piece-goods, sugar and tea continue to be the principal imports. They are all handled by monopoly organisations controlled by the Government, in which local merchants have little share. Retailers of piece-goods expect shortly to be put out of business by the opening of shops by the Cotton piece-goods Monopoly Com pany. 44. Expert of opium has been considerably restricted. Carpets were shipped freely by merchants until the end of the year when all transactions became a mono poly of the Carpet Monopoly Company. Gum tragacanth, almonds and dried59 fruits have also become the objects of monopolies during the year given to Central Companies in Tehran. Agricultural products in general are now controlled by interests centred in the Capital and most of the profits go there. 45. The following Companies have been reported to have been formed during the last two years to handle commodities of interest to the Shiraz trader :— Sherket-i-Tijarati (General import and export). Sherket-i-Sheker wa Qand (Sugar and match import and trade, with a sub sidiary organisation to handle tea, which is not yet in working order). Sherket-i-Panbeh (growing and export of cotton). Tasbit-i-Ghalleh (wheat growing and purchase). Sherket-i-Pust Narm (export of skins) Sherket-i-Qumash (import and trade in cotton piece-goods). Sherket-i-Ketirah (export of gum tragacanth and gum arabic). Sherket-i-Khoshkbar (export of dried fruits, almonds, etc.). Sherket-i-Khollar (wine making and trade). Sherket-i-Ghali (carpet trade). Sherket-i-Saderat-i-Fars wa Banader (production and sale of native crafts, sdver, enamel, mosaic work and hosiery). 46. Most of the principal articles of trade are thus covered by these Companies. They are not well managed. Directors and Managers are permitted to engage in private trade. They are inclined to behave as though they were above the Law and injured parties do not dare to take the matter to the Courts. Large profits are admitted to be made by buying imported goods and holding them off the market. This seems a curious way of spending the tax-payers money which goes to finance such concerns. The control exercised by the Government over these Companies and their policy is loose. Meanwhile all private trade is being throttled, taxes increase the cost of living goes up steadily and there is little return to be seen locally except more and more barracks. 47. Industrial development in Shiraz and the Province of Pars as already been mentioned. The Cotton Spinning Mill at Shiraz, owned by the Ears Manu facturing Company, has given very satisfactory results. A dividend of 86% was paid on the year’s working. Three shifts of operatives, each of 200. are working day and night. Hadji Mohammed Hassan Behbehani, the Managing Director, visited Tehran during the summer and obtained a Government permit for extension of the premises. The buildings have since been erected and it is intended to in crease the plant to 10,000 spindles. The necessary exchange permit has been promised by the Ministry of Finance and the order for Spinning machinery is pro bably to go to Platt Brothers, of Oldham, who supplied the existing plant, and for diesel engines and electrical plant to Mirrleos and the General Electric Company. But some difficulty has arisen over the actual issue of the permits and the machinery cannot for the present be shipped. 48. During the year the same Company imported German machinery which has been sold to the Shahriza Company of Isfahan. 49. The second Spinning Mill at Shiraz, owned by the Dekkan Brothers wdio also own the Ears Electric Company, has installed German machinery which was ready for testing at the end of the year. Large stocks of new cotton are ready for use. A permit to import British machinery was refused by the Ministry of Finance. 50. The Electric Power Station succeeded in giving an all-night service during the month of Ramadan. A second Mirrlees diesel motor is expected shortly which will improve the already fairly reliable town lighting. 51. The Merv Dasht Sugar Refinery, near the Isfahan road some 25 miles north of Shiraz, which was opened in October 1935, commenced work a year later. Local beetroot has been used and by the end of the year sugar was placed on the market. It is of good quality. 40,000 tons of beet are said to be available, giving 18% of sugar! 7,200 tons of sugar have been produced at the rate of 35 tons per day. ° But production is said to cost 200% more than the European sugar cif. Bushire.British interests. 52. The Consulate was in charge of Mr. H. A. D. Hoyland, until April 22nd when he proceeded on leave prior to transfer, handing over to Mr. W. H. Young, Acting Vice-Consul, Mr. C. A. Gault arrived from KerraarLshah in July and remain ed in charge until November 21, when Mr. A. E. Watkinson took over on transfer from Ahwaz. 53. The Governor General of Ears called on His Majesty’s Consul on the oc casion of the death of His Majesty King George V. Owing to Court Mourning no official celebration took place on the Birth-day of His Majesty King Edward VIII. News of the abdication of King Edward in December was reported without com ment in the local press. The flag was flown on December 14 on the occasion of the Birthday of His Majesty King George VI. 54. During 1938, the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Secretary to the Political Resident, and the Residency Surgeon visited Shiraz on recess. Mr. Butler and Mr. Reilly, of His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, also visit ed Persepolis and Shiraz. His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman also passed through Shiraz. 55. Mr. R. F. G. Sarell and Mr. Robert Cecil, Probationer Vice-Consuls, arrived at Shiraz on December 31 to be attached to His Majesty’s Consulate as language students. Mr. W. H. Young left for Tehran a few days later. 56. Other British visitors during the year included Brigadier General Prickett, Lord Alington, the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, the Tehran and Isfahan Managers for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., and various geologists, together with Mr. Schofield an industrialisation expert, who was touring Iran under the auspices of the Oil Company, members of the Church Missionary Society, and a archseologist and an Indian professor. And a large party of students from London camped in the Consulate garden in September, as they were unable to appreciate the accom modation provided for them elsewhere by the local authorities who otherwise did all that could be desired to render their visit profitable and to facilitate their de parture. A party of photographers employed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. visited Persepolis and the Sugar Factory in December and was endeavouring to find camels and lorries in close juxtaposition in accordance with modern ideas of advertise ment, and to satisfy certain recent Police regulations. 57. In addition to the above activities, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company sent a large geological expedition to make a survey of the whole area between Shiraz and Bandar-Abbas and of the Ardakan area in the west of the Province with a view to determining whether any portion of Fars is to be included in the final concession area. The Company also made arrangements for the supply of oil in bulk from Bushire to the Sugar Refinery at Merv Dasht and installed large depots with petrol pumps at Kaserun and at Shiraz. It is reported that a motor road is to be made by the Company from Ganawah to Borazjan, which may render them in dependent of the present track over the “ mashileh ”. 58. The work of the Church Missionary Society’s Hospital at Shiraz has con tinued successfully. Some difficulty with the Municipal Health Officer was settled by the Governor General at the request of the Acting Consul. Bishop Thompson visited the district in September and inaugurated a church at Qalat, 25 miles to the north-west of Shiraz. 59. The Fars Manufacturing Company’s cotton mill has been mentioned else where. Three English Engineers employed there resigned early in the year, as payment of their salaries in accordance with their contract was not in accordance with the new fiscal regulations. They were replaced by two other English Engineers who accepted payment on different terms. Mr. Hussein Agar, of the firm of Hadji Ali Akbar and Sons of Manchester and founder of the Fars Manufacturing Company was absent in Bushire at the end of the year supervising the erection of another factory, having resigned his post as Director of Government Trading Com panies. His son, Mr. Charles Agar, was technical manager of the Shiraz mill throughout the year. 60. The British colony in the district of His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz numbered 123 at the end of the year. Half of these are at Isfahan and half at Shiraz. A considerable amount of the work of the Consulate consisted in routine matters connected with Isfahan. His Majesty’s Consul and the Acting Consul each paid long visits to Isfahan during the year. Arrangements were also madeCL 61 l&gt;y the Consulate for the lease of houses, payment of rent, engagement of a garden* er and guard, and supply of furniture on behalf of the Honourable the Political Resident. Other activities included an exhaustive report on the production of gum tragacanth for the information of a Cambridge professor and the collection of samples of cotton from different parts of the district for the Institute of Plant In dustry at Indore. 61. Subscriptions were sent by the Acting Consul to the King George Jubilee Trust and to the Earl Haig’s Fund as the result of collections in Isfahan and in Shiraz. Foreign interests. 62. After the British Community, the German colony is the most important in Shiraz. There are two families established for many years, one of whom owns a flour mill. The other one was formerly land agent to the Qawam-ul-Mulk. A German is incharge of the Wine Factory controlled by the Government and two Germans are employed at the School of Arts and Crafts under the Education De partment. German mechanics are in charge of machinery at the Pars Electric Company’s spinning mill. 63. There is an Austrian veterinary surgeon established in Shiraz. 64. An Italian engineer is employed by the Municipality and by the Cotton Monopoly Company. 65. American archaeologists under Professor Schmidt were at Persepolis in the winter of 1935-36, but work had not been resumed by the end of 1936. 66. The Bahrein Oil Company has been endeavouring to obtain houses in Shiraz for summer quarters for their American and European employees. Several Americans visited Shiraz during the summer. They have also been trying to make arrangements for supplies of fruit and other local produce to be shipped from Bushire. It seems unlikely that the difficulties of transport and of export regulations will be surmounted. 67. Foreign visitors to the district during the year 1936 included the U. S. S. R. Ambassador and the Italian and Roumanian Ministers for Tehran : the German Minister at Bagdad : the members of the French Air Mission in Tehran ; and various archaeologists of American, French and Belgian nationality. Miscellaneous remarks. 68. Active work at Persepolis stopped in October and all the Americans de parted, leaving a Russian photographer in charge. Mr. McCown was sent from Rey to be in residence in the event of the Shah’s visit taking place, but left again at the end of the year. 69. The Tomb of Darius (Naksh-i-Rustum) can now be reached by car on one of the tracks made for collecting beet. 70. The Louvre Mission was working at Shahpur during part of the year. 71. The maximum temperatures recorded in 1936 was 98° in September, as compared with 98° in August of the previous year. The lowest temperature re corded in the winter of 1935-36 was 24°. In mid-December 1936 the thermometer fell to 22° on several days. The cold was unusually early as well as extreme end some damage was reported to fruit trees, while many early seedlings perished. 72. The rainfall for the winter season of 1935-36 was 4 inches less than in the preceding year. Prospects for the present season indicate even greater shortage of water. British Consulate, Shiraz ; A. E. WATKINSON, The 28th January, 1937. II. B. M. Consul, ( 46 ) (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 31st May 1937.) Letter from Viscount Chiltson, to Mr. Eden, No. 118, dated 30th March. Of all the neighbours of the Soviet Union, Iran is the least-often mentioned in the Soviet press. With the exception of a brief, but surprisingly warm, tribute to the late Minister of Finance, Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Davar, I have seen scarcely EC184EAD62 a reference to Iranian affairs during the last two years, and nothing indicative of the slightest friction between the two countries. The accompanying article, taken from the Journal de Moscou of the 16th March, is therefore of a certain interest. Though it concludes with an expression of confidence that the Iranian autho rities will not tolerate the use of their country by Germany as a base of operations, the article as a whole evinces the clearest concern at the success of German pro paganda in that country, and suggests that a number of Soviet-Iranian difficulties which have arisen in the course of the last year are due to this propaganda, if thev are not actually “ 1’echo du germanophilisme mis a la mode par certains fonc- tionnaires iraniens It is also suggested that an alleged recent cooling-off in the relations between Iran and “ such countries as France and Czechoslovakia ’ may be attributed to the same cause. 2. The article is padded out, in the usual Soviet fashion, with a good deal that is far-fetched and absurd. The writer does not hesitate, for instance, to insinuate that as a result of Dr. Schacht’s recent journey, Persia is now included in the field of Germany’s colonial aspirations, and that the memoirs of W assmuss, which are shortly to be published in Germany, will serve as a useful handbook for the emissaries of fascism now working in Iran. And in his review of the growth of German influence since the war he conveniently forgets to mention that that in fluence suffered an important set-back when the construction of the northern section of the trunk railway was transferred from German to other hands. He does, however, assert that apart from the few dozen German specialists in the service of the Iranian Government, there are about 800 other German subjects engaged in economic or cultural activities, and that these are especially to be found in the regions bordering on the Soviet frontiers, where they are in close contact with Japanese agents and Russian refugees. It would be interesting to know whether there is any truth in this assertion, and whether, in particular, the very large figure for the German colony is correct. 3. For the rest, the Soviet Government are evidently more than a little nervous at the possibility of a German air service to Japan via Iran and Afghanistan. I gather from the reports I have seen from time to time in the print sections that the Afghan Government are not very likely to view this project with favour, but in any event one would have supposed that Soviet influence in Sinkiang was quite sufficient to give the Moscow authorities a deciding voice in the matter. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. ( 47 ) SOCIETE DES NATIONS, Communique au C. 237. 1937 Conseil. Geneve, le 21 mai 1937.

( 48 ) (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 21th May 1937.) Memorandum from His Majesty’s Ambassador, Peking, No. 388 (13/4F/1937), dated 14th April 1937. His Majesty’s Ambassador, Peking, presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and transmits herewith three copies of the undermentioned paper :— Despatch from Acting British Consul-General, Shanghai, No. 91 of 7th April 1937. Enclosure to Serial No. (48). Letter from British Consulate General, Shanghai, No. 87, dated 7 th April 1937. I have the honour to report that Mr. A. Mir Fondereski, who assumed charge of the Iranian Consulate-General in September 1938, has written to inform the Senior Consul that he has received instructions from his Government to close provisionally the Consulate-General at Shanghai from March 20th, 1937. 2. Mr. E. A. Long, Secretary to the Consular Body, informs me that this action has been necessitated by financial stringency and losses on exchange. He adds however that he has heard a somewhat inconsistent report that the Iranian Gov ernment contemplate opening a Legation in China in the near future. ( 49 ) (Enclosure in Foreign Office coverign letter dated 9th June 1937.) Telegram from Sir A. Clark Kerr (Bagdad), No. 57-Saving, dated 31st May 1937. Addressed to Tehran No. 2 of May 31st. Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this morning that Governor of Basra had reported that Persian troops estimated at 24,000 had been concentrated at Ahwaz, Hawiza and Mohammerah. Governor had suggested that troops were possibly to be used to support settlement of colony of Persian tribes amongst Arabs of Khuzistan. Have you any information ? Kepeated to Foreign Office No. 57-Saving.( 50 ) (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 29th June 1937.) Telegram from Mr. Seymour (Tehran), No. 15-Saving, dated 12th June 1937. Following received from Tabriz. Begins. Vague reports have suggested recently that military operations now in progress in Western Azerbaijan have more than routine importance. American arriving from Resaieh now states definitely “ There is war on ” somewhere south and west of Mehabad. During last weekend he observed much military activity including despatch of troops and ammunition and departure of General Officer Commanding. Ends. French and Turkish military Attaches confirm and agree that extension of conscription to Kurds is the cause of the trouble. F ormer however thinks that operations are precautionary whereas the latter believes them to be punitive. No troops seem to have been moved into the area, those in district being evidently judged sufficient. Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No. 15-Saving, repeated to Bagdad telegram No. 3-Saving June 12. ( 51 ) [Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 29th June 1937.) Letter from Mr. Seymour, to Mr. Eden, No. 174, dated 25th May 1937. I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of two interesting despatches which I have received from His Majesty’s Consuls at Ahwaz and Shiraz describing the recent visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to these two towns. 2. The contrast between the interest displayed by His Imperial Majesty in the activities and welfare of the people of Khuzistan and his comparati\ e indiffer ence towards the people of Shiraz seems to bear out Mr. Watkinson s view that his neglect of the latter was deliberate. 3. It is perhaps of interest to note that throughout the tour the Crown Prince appears to have been kept to some extent in the background, though it is true that in Khuzistan His Imperial Majesty was evidently at some pains to familiarise him with various points concerning the administration of the empire. 4. One further point of interest to which I would draw your attention is the continued high esteem in which General Muiny appears to be held by the Shah. General Muiny was mentioned in the second paragraph of Mr. Butler s despatch No. 468 of the 12 th October last, and further particulars concerning him were given in the Iranian personalities recently forwarded from this Legation (see my despatch No. 112 of the 26th March 1937). There can be little doubt that he is at the present moment one of the outstanding military commanders in the country. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s Consuls at Ahwaz (No. 25) and Shiraz (No. 11) respectively. Enclosure 1. Letter from Consul Gardener, to Mr. Seymour, No. 32, dated 25th March 1937. I have the honour to append a statement showing the itinerary of His Imperial Majesty the Shah during his recent visit to Khuzistan, together with a list of his suite. As the Shah’s visit to this province was in the main a visit of inspection, it would, I think, be more convenient to report his views on each Government department, institution or individual. General. His Imperial Majesty appeared throughout to be in an unusually good mood, and showed very few signs of irritation. He appeared on arrival to be in good health and happy to be in Khuzistan. After his return from Khorramshahr and Bandar Shahpur he seemed tired, though he continued to be in a good temper. MC184EADThroughout he drew the attention of the Crown Prince to every point of interest and discussed matters with him. Part of his mission was undoubtedly to familiarise his son with his future empire. As regards the people of the province, I could discover no signs of any real enthusiasm roused by the Shah’s presence. Neither, on the other hand, could one detect any hostility to the Shah. The crowds which congregated to see him were of moderate dimensions, neither large nor small. Many people took advantage of his presence (as related below) to present petitions. During this visit the Shah manifested a great interest in the foreign news, and it is stated that a report was read to him every night. There is definite evidence that special arrangements were made to supply him with the day’s foreign news during the one night he spent at Hindi]an. During this visit the Shah has on several occasions shown his solicitude for his people. For instance, he stopped several times on the journey from Khor- ramabad and Salehabad and talked to the tribesmen who have been settled on the land there. In each case he asked if their lives were not now better than formerly when they were nomads. Similarly, he assured the Arab, and Bakhtiari tribesmen settled on the Shahar (Shahpur) dam that they would be given free land and would be looked after. All the telegrams of congratulation addressed to the Shah on his birthday were forwarded to Ahwaz. It is reported that he received telegrams from the Sovereigns or Presidents, Foreign Ministers, etc., of nearly every country in the world, and was delighted to get them. At the small New Year’s Day reception at Bandar Shahpur the Shah distri buted in all about 100 gold half-Pahlavi pieces. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Mr. Elkington, the general manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, accom panied by Mr. Clegg, came up from Abadan to Ahwaz to greet His Imperial Majesty on his arrival here. They and the manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran (who, unfortunately, was not present) were the only Europeans invited, and they were given a place of honour at the railway station. Everyone of importance was presented to the Shah, who acknowledged the presentation with a bow or a nod only. In the case of Messrs. Elkington and Clegg, however, the Shah stopped and said that he knew them and was glad to see them. During the whole of,the Shah’s visit there were continual rumours that he would visit Fields and Abadan. Actually, he visited none of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s areas. I can advance no theory to account for this abstention, which is all the more extraordinary as His Royal Highness the Crown Prince has not, I understand, seen any of the Company’s work, though the Shah himself has visited both Fields and Abadan on former visits. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, at the request of General Muiny and the Governor-General, co-operated whole-heartedly in the preparations for the Shah’s visit. I understand they lent the municipality lorries, and gave them oil for road making, in addition to ensuring that the town electric supply was adequate. The company also sent about forty tents to Hindi]’an for the use of the Shah on his journey to Bushire. Military. General Muiny was always accounted to be a favourite of His Imperial Majesty, and the attitude of the Shah during this present visit has confirmed the report. The general accompanied the Shah continuously from the time when the Shah entered his command at Malayer until he left it on the other side of Hindijan. The Shah displayed great pleasure at his work in organising the military forces of Khuzistan and Luristan. In particular, His Imperial Majesty was pleased with the new military hospital just completed in Ahwaz. He thanked General Muiny, for the skill and energy he had displayed. For Noruz, the Ministry of \\ ar had notified General Muiny of the award to him of the “ Iftikhari ” decoration, but the Shah changed it verbally here to “ Liaqat ”, second class. As a further mark of his Royal favour, sixty out of the sixty-three recommendations for promotion for officers forwarded by General Muiny were sanctioned by the Shah. This, I am informed, is a very high proportion.67 There is no doubt that General Muiny stands higher than ever in the Shah’s estimation. Iranian Air Force. The Shah was interested in this section and attended an aerial review. Both previous to and during the Shah’s visit, great aerial activity was observed. At times, as many as nine machines were seen in the air at one time. No reports adverse to these British machines were heard. Iranian Navy. His Imperial Majesty inspected the Iranian navy at Khorramshahr and travelled from that port to Bandar Shahpur on a naval sloop. During the inspection at Khorramshahr, one Yawar was deprived of his rank by the Shah and apparently imprisoned. His offence apparently consisted in not reporting the strength of his command, etc., in the regulation manner to the Shah. The Yawar apparently belonged to General Muiny’s command, for the general requested the Crown Prince to approach the Shah with a view to a pardon being granted. This Yawar was pardoned on the day His Imperial Majesty left Khuzistan. Two incidents lead to the supposition that Sarhang Bayendor may not be very popular with the Shah. During the degradation scene mentioned above, the Shah pushed Bayendor violently in the chest. Furthermore, the Shah asked him how it was that the navy struck and killed people. This was a reference to the various instances of bad conduct of naval men, which had doubtless been reported to the Shah. These two incidents are not, unfortunately, sufficiently serious to lead to the hope that Sarhang Bayendor may be relieved of his command. Customs Administration. The Shah would seem to be aware of the congestion in the customs and of the inefficiency of that department. When the various officials were presented to him at Khorramshahr, he shook his head sadly at the mention of the name of the Director of Customs, and said : “ The Customs make extraordinary mistakes ”. Bandar Shahyour. When at Khorramshahr the Shah asked why such quantities of goods were imported through Khorramshahr and not through Bandar Shahpur. He was informed that the latter port had not the necessary facilities. There is, however, a rumour that when the Shah returns to Tehran he will order some portion of the traffic to be diverted from Khorram hahr to Bandar Shahpur. When he visited Bandar Shahpur, he discussed the port with Aqa Mushar, head of the Southern Railways. It is stated (but no proof is at present available) that the Shah ordered Mushar to extend the existing jetty to a total length of 300 metres and to construct adequate warehouses, so that merchandise should not be damaged. It is stated that the Shah was very insistent on the latter point. In regard to the main scheme of urbanisation, etc., at Bandar Shahpur, it is stated that the Shah has come to no decision, but will study the project in Tehran, in view of the great expenditure involved. Railway and Roads. At first, His Imperial Majesty was not too pleased with the railway, but he revised this opinion and towards the end of his visit expressed his pleasure threat. It is stated that the Shah considered the road from Khorramahad to Sale- habad dangerous and ordered steps to be taken to remedy this. It is also stated that he has ordered a road to be constructed from Ahwaz to Malamir. Education. The Shah during his visit gave proof of his interest in education. In every town he visited the school-children were paraded to see him, and these parades gave him great pleasure. In Ahwaz he inspected the new high school and was pleased. He seems pleased with the work of the Director of Education for Khuzistan.68 Agricultural Department. This seems to be the one department with which the Shah is displeased. Aqa Fikrat thTpro'vdncial Director of Agriculture, is under orders to go. Apparently hikrat, tiie «ovin uncleaned cotton were grown on an average of^T^ wh^tL expenses of the department were very heavy The Shah accused th; department of inefficiency while the director attempted to excuse himself by saving that the seed was diseased. The Shah retaliated by Sking why Ae Iranian technical men trained in Europe had not been used to examine the seed. ^ r y n , i The strength of the department is being considerably reduced because the Crown lands am, on the Shah’s orders, to be handed over to the Fmance Department for early distribution to cultivators. The Shah has ordered that within five years 25,000 hectares of land should be devoted to the cultivation of cotton in Khuzistan. Ahwaz Spinning Mill. The board of the Ahwaz mill petitioned the Shah for cheaper cotton arguing that the mill here worked at a considerable disadvantage because the cotton au to be imported largely from the north, while the finished yarn had to be sent north for The cost of transport made the Ahwaz mill’s products very expensive. In reply the Shah said that the supply of local-grown cocton would soon be su cient. P 5 the Shah added that the company should import a weaving plant, m order to avoid the necessity of sending the yarn north. The Shah expressed pleasure at the mill in Ahwaz and was informed that the spinning plant was the product of a British firm (Messrs, la). y djr'ious • The Shah visited the French Archaeological Mission at Shush, and JS reported to have shown annoyance at their work, complaining that they worked too slowly and sent too much out of the country. The question of whether or not triumphal arches should be constructed was a hard-fought one. Money was collected from all classes of people to build about twenty one arches, each costing not less than 800 tomans. Sanction w^ gjven to buv £1 000 worth of red, white and green cloth from Basra. Both the Governor General and the military pressed for the erection of the arches. Then orders were received from Tehran not to build arches and the Governor-General attempted to remove them. The military objected and the arches stood Meanwhile, the military telegraphed to Tehran that the people to build arches^ Fmally orders were received to remove them. It is said that the people of Sultanabad and Malayer complained to the Shah against being put to the expense of bu d ng arches and he agreed with their point of view. It is not known how the balance of the money collected will be distributed. The local authorities tried to stop petitions being sent to the Shah some days before his arrival, but realised it was impossible. Police officers were stationed outside the Post Office to take the names and addresses of all who posted letters addressed to the Shah, with a view to intimidating petitioners. This did not, how ever succeed and many hundreds of letters and telegrams of complaint were sent to him.’ To counteract to some degree the effect of petitions against the army, that body caused a considerable number of messages of satisfaction to be sent to the Shah. As far as can be gathered, about half of the complaints were against the army Other causes of complaint were the cost of living, the municipality and the burden of taxation. Considerable comment was caused by the Shah’s action in leaving Ahwaz for Bushire on the ftuz-i-Qatl. Previous to and during the Shah’s visit the police made a fair number of arrests (including two Iraqis). So far no charge has been made against the prisoners, and it is quite possible that they were placed in custody merely as a preventive measure.The Shah was interested in a bronze statute found near Malamir, stated to be a 4,000-year-old figure of Shahpur. He ordered it to be sent to Tehran, as he thinks the metal may contain gold. The Shah examined the plans of the new streets proposed for Ahwaz and several other towns, and approved them. Although unpopular at the beginning of the visit, the Governor-General seems to have outlasted the Shah’s visit. As a final act before leaving Ahwaz, His Imperial Majesty summoned all the officials and impressed upon them the importance of their duties. He urged them to carry them out faithfully and zealously. I am sending copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s vice-consul at Khor- ramshalir (No. 443). v Enclosure 2. Letter from Consul Watkinson, to Mr. Seymour, No. 13, dated 31st March 1937. I have the honour to report that the long-expected visit of His Majesty the Shah has at last taken place, after rumours had been current that all the prepa rations as described in my diary for February were in vain, as he would not leave the capital. From the 'western democratic standpoint, much appears to have been done in advance to render the visit unpalatable, and little during its progress to make it agreeable to the inhabitants of Shiraz. 2. The amount said to have been spent by the Governor-General and the municipal authorities on successive schemes of decoration has already been reported. A sum equal to five times that amount is generally believed to have been collected from the people and has not been accounted for, in addition to which many notables and merchants were forced to buy photographs of the Imperial Family at an exces sive price, and tales are told of those who demurred being beaten. Every mason and carpenter in the town who did not hide was ordered to give his services free. Finally, only four of the original twenty-seven arches were left, erected nominally by the municipality, the ladies of Shiraz, the Sherket-i-Panbeh and the Sherket-i- Sedarat. The remainder were demolished on instructions from Tehran that Muharrem could not be observed with flags and rejoicing. The two cotton mills, which had spent very considerable sums on erecting arches by order of the Governor- General, were instructed to remove them. 3. Two days before the arrival of His Majesty the road to Bushire was closed to all traffic. The mail also ceased to arrive from the north. At the same time the town was occupied by an armed police force from Tehran, and traffic was for the most part diverted from the main roads through the town over which the Imperial procession was to pass. Donkeys and their drivers in particular seemed to be unpopular. In addition to armed patrols, plain-clothes policemen mingled with the crowds of curious onlookers at the final preparations, and they must have heard much murmuring. Two members of the Church Missionary Society from Isfahan, who had obtained permission from the Rais-i-Amnieh to go to Bushire on the 24th March, were stopped on the road between Borazjan and Bushire and told that they must wait for three days at Ahmedi, a small and unpleasant village, till the Shah had passed. On payment of some inducement, they were permitted to continue their journey. This savours of the old days of rahdari. 4. It is pleasing to be able to record that the Rais-i-Amnieh was himself held up on the following day by an over-zealous policeman and was forced to return for a few words with the chief of police. 5. All stray dogs were shot without warning by the police during the few weeks preceding His Majesty’s arrival, and a number belonging to private indivi duals were done away with. 6. It was reported on the 26th March that His Majesty was very displeased with his reception in complete silence at Bushire, and that instructions were sent to Kazerun and to Shiraz that it would be well to improve on this. On the way up from Bushire His Majesty visited the excavations at Shahpur, where he was received by M. Goddard, of the Ministry of Education. He then returned to Kazerun, where he spent the night along with most of the provincial officials. MC184EAD70 7. The Imperial party arrived on the outskirts of Shiraz at 10-30 a.m. ort the 27th March. The hooter at the cotton mill blared continuously from then on until orders were given bv the Shah two hours later that it was to cease. At the entrance to the town a guard of honour was inspected, and it is reported that a woman, who has since disappeared, succeeded in presenting a petition. A few of the local notables were on parade. Apparently no attempt was made to collect tribesmen, as was done in other districts during the Shah’s progress. It is perhaps as well that no opportunity was given for His Majesty publicly to ignore the foreign consuls as on the occasion of his last visit to Shiraz. 8. A large part of the population of the town lined the Khiaban-i-Zand dragooned by 400 armed policemen. Parties of school-children were stationed at intervals with flowers purloined from half the gardens of Shiraz. His Majesty passed down this road at GO miles per hour. There was no time for cheering nor for casting of flowers, and no notice was taken of the people or the children. \\ hen the Shah had passed, they were marched away with their flowers. They had been there since 6-30 a.m. 9. A narrow street leads from the Khiaban-i-Zand to the house recently occupied by the Governorate-General, which had been prepared for the Shah. All the occupants of the houses in this street had been turned out by the police on the previous day. His Majesty slowed down at the corner, where there was feeble- cheering, and drove slowly up to the end of the street, where a delegation of women and boy scouts and the main body of school-children awaited him. He was greeted by rousing cheers here as he descended from his car. An address of welcome was read by the wife of the newly-appointed Governor of the Qashgai, after which His Majesty spoke a few words to the women and inspected the children. He was very genial, and he specially praised the girls from Khanum Ella Gerrard’s School. There is no record of his having found very much else to his satisfaction in Shiraz. A second woman presented a petition on behalf of her son, a Qashgai cadet, who was sentenced to death for striking his superior officer and had the sentence com muted to imprisonment. The mother has now joined her son. 10. During the afternoon of Saturday His Majesty remained in his house, though the Bagh-i-Takht barracks had been warned to expect him. On Sunday morning the Ears Manufacturing Company was instructed to await an inspection of their mill, the first to be erected in Iran and one which has hitherto been very successful. Towards the end of the morning a message was received that he might go later in the day. In the afternoon he reviewed the troops at the Bagh-i-Takht and again failed to visit the spinning mill. On Monday morning His Majesty again stayed indoors, though he was expected at the Kalah-i-Fars Industrial Exhibition. He spent the afternoon visiting the cavalry and artillery barracks and stopped for half an hour at the exhibition on his way back. He is reported to have complained of its smallness and inadequacy, and to have stated that Shiraz indus- rial activity leaves much to be desired. Early on the following morning His Majesty left Shiraz for Persepolis and Isfahan. So far as is known, the Valiahd paid no visits and was never seen without his father. 11. Thus, during a stay of two and a half days in Shiraz, His Majesty did nothing but visit the various military establishments and an industrial exhibition organised two years ago by the Government. Neither of the two spinning mills was visited, nor did the Shah show interest in the schools nor in the museum recently organised by the Education Department, nor in the restorations at the Tomb of Hafiz and the Masjid-i-Vekil. So far as I can ascertain, he received no deputation nor any members of the community, and he was scarcely seen at all by the people of the town. And the Valiahd was not permitted to deputise for his father and perform any act which might have gained him some measure of popularity and approval. Two presents were graciously accepted from the in dustrial and trading companies, one of which is understood to be a picture framed in gold worth 40,000 rials. 12. The Qawam-ul-Mulk was a member of the Shah r s suite. During his stay in Shiraz, the first since he left here for a forced sojourn in Tehran some years ago, he visited various members of his family. He did not stay in one of his own houses. An English lady who was formerly in his household was here at the time. She was permitted to dine with him. According to information from this rather71 garrulous source, the Shah was in the best of health and was not prevented by illness from doing all the things which had been expected of him. He is probably tired after the tour, which would explain the shortness of the stages on his return journey from Bushire to Tehran. 13. This complete aloofness can only be taken as indicating the Shah’s dis' pleasure with Shiraz and a deliberate intention to show it. Possibly His Majesty was made aware that the leading industrialists and merchants proposed to present a petition begging for a revision of the Government’s economic policy, which is ruining the district and has caused the cost of living to increase 100 per cent, or more during the last three years. He had also possibly heard that the Pars Manu facturing Company had decided not to enlarge their mill. It is also reported that the Shah entered into conversation with an Amnieh guard on the road from Bushire, who told him that all the people are discontented owing to the high cost of living. 14. The w r hole circumstances of this visit can have done nothing to increase the popularity of the Shah and of the present regime. No opportunity was taken of showing the Valiahd to the people or of letting him see anything of value to himself. It is most unfortunate that he was kept on leading strings and had no chance for the display of initiative or geniality. l|L *2- ( 52 ) (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter datei 17th June 1937.) Letter from British Embassy, Rome, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, M.C., No. 441, dated 28th May 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 430 of May 21st, I have the honour to report that the “ Corriere della Sera ”of May 14th published a message from its special correspondent in India, Signor Salvatore Aponte, describing the Indian attitude towards the Coronation. This attitude, he said, was symbolised by an episode which repeated itself every evening throughout India : when the British national anthem was played at the end of a show, while the Europeans and high Indian officials in the gallery stood up, the crowd in the pit ostentatiously aban doned the hall. The most splendid jewel of the “ British Crown ” remained absent from the London celebrations. Of course, the Maharajas, the Nawabs, etc., and the officials chosen by Delhi had gone to London, but the former repre sented none but themselves, and the latter could only represent the authority of the rulers. The Indian people were absent. 2. But also about the state of mind of the Indian rulers and high officials there was something to be said. Whatever the real feelings of the Indian Princes to wards their British protectors might be, the idea of the great Indian Federation had provoked violent confusion in their ranks. Their first reaction was one of conditional approval, but it had rapidly changed into coldness and also open hostility. Also those Indians who held aloof from the non-co-operation movement and accepted jobs from the British authorities, had begun to show the will “ to think with their own heads ”. At the last general election numerous officials of every class cast their votes in favour of the Nationalist candidates. Still more significant was the attitude of the prominent Indians who had been invited to attend the Coronation. On leaving for London, they had made declarations which were certainly neither friendly towards the British nor flattering for British achievements in India. In taking leave of their fellow-countrymen some of them had expressed their devotion to the idea of Indian independence. 3. This was perhaps one of the most notable phenomenons of the present evolution in Anglo-Indian relations, which was characterised by a rapid decline in the prestige of the whites. The fact that thousands of Indian youths went to England for their studies had not helped to keep up British prestige in India. On their return to India, these educated, good-mannered and often very intelligent Indians felt irritated and aggrieved at the presence of numerous Englishmen who not only occupied highly-paid posts, but also treated them with “ an implacable and undisguised racial animosity J72 4. In this background of “ spite'’, lavck of esteem and “ disdain ” the political events of the last few weeks could not but provoke a further tension of feelings. The Coronation festivities could not have come off at a worse moment than the present, when the whole of India was irritated and agitated by political movements, ^ strikes, which in certain provinces, like Bengal, had assumed alarming proportions, and armed revolts, and when a new civil disobedience campaign was being threatened. 5. Naturally, there had been proposals for boycotting the Coronation festi vities in India, but the Congress leaders did not do anything : they wanted to ignore the celebrations altogether. After quoting from an article in the Calcutta “ Amrita Bazar Patrika ” criticising the Government invitation to the municipalities to celebrate the Coronation with fireworks and illuminations, Signor Aponte said that certain municipalities did not accept the invitation, while others decided to use the money by distributing clothes and foodstuffs to the poor, by building hospitals and leper settlements, which, together with schools, India needed most of all. 6. The ec Stampa ” Jerusalem correspondent stated that the Arabs there maintained a reserved attitude on the occasion of the Coronation festivities, dis played no flags and took no part whatever in the ceremonies. ( 53 ) Letter from the British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 105/30/37, dated 19th June 1937. We have got on the way out a consignment of corrugated iron roofing which is being sent out by the Office of Works for the Consulate at Kermanshah, and which has been addressed to the Consul. Normally such consignments in order to avoid customs charges, are addressed to the Legation unless they are due to arrive within the Consul’s period of nine months franchise. In this particular case, even though the consignment won’t arrive within this period, no great loss will be sustained as, on account of its weight, transport from Kermanshah to Tehran and ba ;k would probably cost almost as much if not more than the actual duty. 2. We have however sounded the Protocol Department somewhat tentatively about whether materials of this sort imported from abroad for a Consulate are liable to duty or not. (They are not really covered by the list given in the law of articles which are exempt.) The Protocol have replied by hinting at reciprocity. We are not quite sure whether we want to press the point, which might possibly give an awkward precedent as far as India was concerned, but before going further we should be most grateful if you would be so good as to let us know what the position would be in a similar case in the United Kingdom. At Kermanshah the Consulate is owned by His Majesty’s Government and the roofing is required for the actual structure. Enclosure to Serial No. (53). Letter from Foreign Office, London, to the British Legation, Tehran, No. T.-l 0074/70/373, dated 16th July 1937. Your letter 105/30/7 of the 19th June regarding a consignment of corrugated iron roofing for the Consulate at Kermanshah. Consignments of this nature intended for foreign Consulates in this country would be admitted duty-free as “ official supplies ”, provided the material was the property of the foreign government concerned at the time of importation. So far as we are aware, the policy of the Government of India in these matters is point-for-point reciprocity. You might perhaps tell the Iranians what the practice is in the United Kingdom, and see how it works. ( 54 ) Letter from the British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 183, dated 25th May 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 133 of April 9th .last, concerning the closure of the Ahwaz customs and also the more general question of congestion at the Gulf ports, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of an interesting73 despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz which has been written in reply to Mr. Butler’s letter No. 151/6/37 of February 20th, a copy of which was forwarded to Mr. Baggallay. 2. It will be observed that although Mr. Gardener considers it possible that at some future date Bandar Shahpur may be destined to become the only Persian Gulf port for imports for North and Central Iran, there are at present no signs that the Ahwaz Customs house will shortly be closed nor, so far as he is aware, are active steps being taken to divert traffic from Khorramshahr to Bandar Shahpur. Since that despatch was written, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr has, however, reported that he has heard from a reliable source that the customs house at Khorramshahr is to be transferred to Bandar Shahpur and that the move is to be made as soon as possible. • Captain Bazalgette is nevertheless of opinion that large sums of money would have to be spent and considerable time would have to elapse before Bandar Shahpur would be capable of dealing with the increase in shipping caused by such a move. 3. With regard to the general question of congestion at the Gulf ports, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a memorandum which has been prepared by Captain Bazalgette dealing with the congestion at the Khorramshahr Customs, its causes and the part it has played in bringing about the formation of the monopolistic Iranian landing Company (Shirkat Kashtirani Karun). 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, No. 36 and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, No. 27. Enclosure to Serial No. (54). Letter from the British Consulate, Ahwaz, to the British Legation, Tehran, No. 50, dated 17th April 1937. I have the honour to refer to Mr. Butler’s letter to me No. 151/6/37 of the 20th February received on March 21st, last, calling for a report on the prospect of traffic being diverted from the port of Khorramshahr to Bandar Shahpur. 2. From recent despatches addressed to the Legation you will have learnt that the general chaotic conditions in the Customs and harbours of the Persian Gulf have been worsened by the action of the Iranian Navy in forming a monopolistic landing company at Khorramshahr with no effective guarantees of speedy despatch of ocean ships or of the safe delivery of the cargo they discharge. Just before this event the Strick and Hansa Lines (being the largest shippers to Bandar Shahpur) had decided to restrict if not to refuse cargo for the ports ofBushire and Bandar Shahpur and to continue their traffic with Khorramshahr. I imagine that the two companies had decided to continue their trade with Khorramshahr because in that port at any event they had control of the discharge of their ships and so could prevent inordinate delays. Now the situation in Khorramshahr is equally con fused. With such a background of chaos and ineptitude it is difficult to trace any long term policy of the Iranian Government in determining the route to be followed by future imports. All the views and inferences mentioned hereafter are therefore offered with all reserves. 3. It is certainly logical to assume that the Iranian Government after creating a port, not on the Shatt-el-Arab, and linking it by rail to the North had in mind the prospect of canalising along that route all imports, destined for the interior and the North. As regards the meeting held at Ahwaz in September last between the Governor General and the shipping agents, the account of it given in paragraph 2 of Mr. Butler’s letter under reference is confirmed by Mr. Spence of Mespers, except that a representative of Mespers was not present. I have been unable to see Mr. Wengoborski. No attempt would seem to have been made since to enforce the use of Banda&gt;r Shahpur at the expense of Khorramshahr. I im gine this may have been because the limitations of Bandar Shahpur were recognised. 4. However when the Shah was recently in Khorramshahr he is reported to have asked why such quantities of cargo were discharged in that port instead of in Bandar Shahpur. I am informed (but I cannot guarantee the information) that the Provincial Director of Customs at Khorramshahr and a high military officer explained that the capacity of Bandar Shahpur was limited. I am inclined to MCI84EAD74 think that the Shah did not entirely accept this explanation when he visited Bandar Shahpur as a great deal of window dressing was done for his visit—cargo being piled up to give appearance of ample storage room, etc. However as I have already reported the Shah ordered the prolongation of the existing jetty to a total length of 300 metres to accommodate two ships alongside. Mr. Fritze of the Hansa Line also informed me that the jetty is to be widenel to take two railway tracks. I suppose this will be paid for out of the item 5 million rials for building expenses at Bandar Shahpur inscribed in this year’s budget. Barges and a tug have been ordered, as also twelve locomotives and one hundred railways trucks. 5. I would therefore infer that at some future date, Bandar Shahpur is destined to be the only Persian Gulf Port for imports for North and Central Iran. With the present facilities and indeed for some time to come, the capacity of the port must be admitted even by the Iranians as inadequate for such a role and therefore Khor- ramshahr must continue to be used. In any event, the Iranian Government would seem ill-advised to ban the use of Khorramsliahr because the Karun River affords cheap transport to Ahwaz where the merchandise for the North can be put on the railway. The only loss to the railway would be the transport of the goods over the 106 kilometers from Bandar Shahpur to Ahwaz and compensation for this might be sought by charging the same freight rates as from Bandar Shahpur. 6. In regard to the rumoured closing of the Ahwaz Customs house I have no information to suggest that this will be done. The Sherkat-i-Sakhteman were about to build a new Customs House and warehouses on the right bank of the Karun. This monopoly Company having been dissolved, the Director of Customs here informed me that he had applied to Tehran for permission to build it himself and was daily awaiting a reply. This was some time ago and admittedly the absence of a reply does not augur well. On the other hand, the Customs here is responsible for Bandar Shahpur as well as for posts on the Iraq frontier. So far there have been no signs that the Customs facilities at Bandar Shahpur are to be augmented. At the present time a great deal of the merchandise landed at that port is cleared through the Customs House at Ahwaz. If the Customs House here is closed, it would seem obvious that the Customs facilities at Bandar Shahpur must first be increased. This process must take a considerable time as the marsh around the port has first to be drained, and Customs house and warehouses must be built as well as dwelling houses for the staff. A supply of fresh water must also be provided. 7. To recapitulate, I would repeat that I have no information which would suggest either that the Ahwaz Customs House will shortly be closed or that active steps are at present being taken to divert traffic from Khorramshahr to Bandar Shahpur. I would however re-iterate the reserves already formulated and amplify them by remarking that modern Iranians seem obsessed with a na tionalistic bias which leads them to take over enterprises previously conducted by foreigners and launch new ones like Bandar Shahpur. Owing to their lack of experience and efficiency Iranian administrations in general are not able to carry these tasks out efficiently. Their failures do not seem to be recognised and so the ordinary rules of prudence and commonsense do not seem to apply. This blind persistence may make for national greatness but it can be extremely irritating. 8. Copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khor ramshahr, No. 567. Enclosure II to Serial No. (54). Note on the landing of Cargo at Khorramshahr. Since the Belgian experts, previously in charge of the Customs, handed over their duties to Iranian Officials, the Customs have got into an increasingly chaotic state. The Great Fire of August 1935 did but little to ease the situation, and in fact, increased the muddle. 2. The main and original causes of Customs congestion are (a) the complicated office routine, which appears to vary from day to day or month to month as new and contradictory orders are received from Tehran. (See paragraph 41 of my Annual Commercial Report for the Iranian Year ended the 20th March 1937.)(b) the shortage of cranes to unload barges, and the lack of means to carry goods from the wharves to go-downs or stackyards, (c) the complete lack of method in stacking goods and the general disorder in the Customs areas, {d) the ignorance, laziness and unreliability of most of the Customs Officials and the lack of order and method in their offices. 3. The congestion has been increased during the last year by— (a) the difficulty importers have experienced in obtaining Foreign Exchange to take up their shipping documents from the Banks, (b) the spate of goods imported by the Monopoly Companies, who appear to have ordered a year’s requirements to arrive in the last few months. 4. The overcrowding of the Customs Compound proper has led to overflows of cargoes being dumped in and around Khorramshahr town in any available open space. For instance (i) Motor Cars in Abadan (being assembled by Messrs. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company). (ii) Motor Cars in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s Compound in Khor ramshahr (landed by Messrs, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company). {Hi) General Cargo in Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co.’s old house. {iv) Tea and sugar in Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s old general office. (v) Heavy building material, girders, iron beams, cement, also tea and piece-goods at Diwanieh and Fahlieh (Sheikh Khazal’s old palaces on the bank of Shatt-al-Arab two miles up river). (vi) Packages of general cargo in Husseinia (place close to the Vice- Consulate). (vii) Piece-goods, iron beams, etc., in Kut-i-Sheikh. (mi) Sugar and piece-goods in Moshi Kohen’s go-down, finally (he) Barges in the river. 5. The overcrowding, varied dumping grounds, lack of Customs staff and general inefficiency has prevented barges being unloaded and has caused a barge shortage. As a result British Shipping Agents have been forced to bring in extra craft from Basra. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited were able to utilise spare barges owned by their Basra Office, but Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co., Ltd. and Messrs. African and Eastern (Near East) Limited were forced to hire at high rates. Local barge owners, when they saw that Agents were ready to pay Dinars 5 per diem for a barge, raised their rates to Rials 500. 6. Delays in unloading barges and the increased hire rates increased the costs of landing goods, and Shipping Agents, after running at a loss [see paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 1519 of 21st December 1936 regarding Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co., Ltd., and paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 9/11/203 of 17th February 1937 regarding Messrs. African &amp; Eastem (Near East), Limited] put up their landing charges to cover their expenses. (The Mesopotamia Iran Corporation owning their own barges or utilising those of their Basra Office were able to carry on with but slight loss.) For instance in March it cost Messrs. Frank C. Strick &amp; Co., Limited, approximately £3.000 to land approximately 3,000 tons from the S. S. “ Kuhistan ”. To balance their books they were forced to charge from Rials 75 to Rials 90 per ton in landing charges on this cargo. 7. The Naval Authorities cite the case of the “ Kuhistan ” as the final cause of the monopolisation of the landing of cargo, and Major Ghulam Hussain Bayen- dor says in a letter to Messrs. Grey, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited—“ In order to ter minate the coercion of Steamship Companies’ Agents towards importers the question of landing cargo has been entrusted to the Karim Navigation Company”. (It is interesting to note that no reference whatsoever has been made to orders or ins tructions from Tehran, as is usually done by local authorities when enforcing a new order.) 8 One cannot forget, however, that when Sarhang Bayendor floated both the still-born Shirkat-i-Naqlieh and the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun (see my despatch No 9/11/1519 of 21st April 1937) that he said that he hoped to obtain monopolyrights for these companies. I do not think that Sarhang Bayendor visualised a “ Port of Khorramshahr Authority ” or “ Khorramshahr port Trust ” with all the responsibilities and duties undertaken by such bodies as the Port of London Autho rity or the Bombay Port Trust. I am inclined to think that his sole motive was to “ keep the money in the country ” and to keep local affairs of any kind under his own control. The volume of correspondence between the Naval Port Officer, the Director of Customs and Managing Director of the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun passing the baby ” of responsibility for goods from one to another shows that neither Sarhang nor Major Bayendor had foreseen that any responsibility was entailed. They have displayed considerable ignorance of Shipping and Business methods on other occasions and I am of opinion that they did not realise what their liabilities would be if the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun obtained monopoly rights or that they would be responsible to any one other than themselves. In fact, I think Colonel Bayendor imagined that the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun would give him increased power and money, and the gratitude of His Imperial Majesty the Shah and all Iranians for Iranianising a lucrative business, previously in the hands of foreigners. 9. Since the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun received monopoly rights foreign shipping has avoided Khorramshahr to a certain extent. During the first half of April only six ships called here instead of the usual ten, and of these 4 were the B. I. S. N. Co.’s Fast or Slow Mails. This Company is handing over their cargoes “ undepstrict protest”, although the Naval Authorities after asking for a definition of protest repudiate its admissibility. Messrs. Frank C. Strick &amp; Co., Limited’s Steamers and the Hansa Line are avoiding this port, and I have seen a letter from the latter company stating that while they do not wish to impede the trade of Iran they cannot allow delays to their ships on account of inefficiency. They are collecting a large consignment of goods for Iran into one ship at Basra and are sending her to Bandar Shahpur. If she cannot be unloaded immediately, she is to proceed to Bombay and dispose of the cargo there. Messrs. Frank C. Strick &amp; Co., Limited, appear to be working in conjunction with the Hansa Line. This amounts to a form of limited boycott, as suggested in Mr. Gardener’s despatch No. 44, dated the 16th April 1937. * 10. With the limited amount of cargo arriving at present it is hard to say whether the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun will be able to develop into an efficient landing company. It is interesting to note that their charges were immediately 20% above those last quoted by Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited, and that the instruc tions that they must insure cargo in their barges between ship and shore with the Agence Istufani Tehran had not then been given. Their barges, tugs and launches are old and even the best would hardly pass a strict survey. They have engaged blacksmiths and carpenters to patch certain other lighters to augment their fleet, and talk of placing orders in Germany for new iron barges. At present they have not the money to make purchases, but will require credit and Foreign Exchange from the Iranian Government, which will be hard to obtain with the failure of the German-Iran clearing agreement. Again, they are not employing men renowned either for their knowledge of shipping or business integrity. Such men as Hira- nand Hingorani (see my despatch No. 18/11/1422 of 24th November 1936) who is their Shipping Superintendent, and Z. H. Khan (see paragraph 243 of my Diary No. 16 for 1936) who was dismissed by Messrs. African and Eastern (Near East) Limited for inefficiency and dishonesty some months ago, are not likely to inspire the public with confidence. I feel sure, however, that rather than admit their own inefficiency, they will blame any possible failure on the lack of co-operation of Foreign Steamship Companies. 11. The British Shipping Agents, for different reasons hope that the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun will fail. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited, know that Mesopotamia Iran Corporation made a satisfactory profit out of the landing business in the past and hope to do so again. Messrs. Frank G. Strick &amp; Co., Limited and Messrs. African and Eastern (Near East), Ltd., are not finding their dealings with the Shirkat’s representatives, chiefly Mr. Hiranand Hingorani, any too easy. The latter refused Messrs. Frank C. Strick &amp; Co., Limited, any receipt for cargo discharged from the S. S. “ Bandar Shahpur ” recently. (See my telegram No. 14 of 14th April 1937.) On the other hand they are not anxious to resume landing cargo which has been a tiresome and unremunerative business for them since theydo not own their own barges. All the Agents are anxious about their responsibility for cargo as they cannot obtain any valid receipts until the Customs Storekeeper checks the cargo by the manifest on shore, which may be weeks after the cargo was discharged from the ship. 12. The landing of cargo and clearance of goods, whether by foreign Agents or by a monopoly company, cannot be an efficient business until the bottle neck of the Customs is cleared, the complicated and expensive procedure of clearing goods simplified and the general disorder in both offices and compounds is straightened. It is not for me to say whether the Iranian Government would re-employ foreign Customs Directors as in the past, but were it possible a great obstacle to foreign trade would be removed. If the Iranian Government decided on such a ’’retrogarde ” step, they might, too, agree to employing expert Port Officers to form an efficient and remunerative Port Trust. I fear, however, that such is beyond the bounds of possibility. Enclosure III to Serial No. (54). Copy to Mr. Baggallay No. 151/6/37. Reference Foreign Office Despatch N o. 23 (E. 7885/735/34) of 16th January 1937. No. 151/6/37. 20th February, 1937. Your despatch No. 1 of the 7th January about navigation on the Karun. 2. We have heard from the Foreign Office that the Euphrates-Tigris Steam Navigation Company (i.e., the owners of the old Shattrah and the Shirin, managed by Mespers as agents for the Iran Transport Company) and Stricks are alarmed°by further reports of measures contemplated by the Iranian Government to divert traffic from the Karun to Bandar Shahpur and the railway, in particular by closing once more the Customs house at Ahwaz. The British interests concerned are natur ally perturbed by any threat to Khorramshahr and the Karun, since on the one hand they would lose the river traffic to Ahwaz, and on the other British ships would be greatly delayed if they used Bandar Shahpur, which is still hopelessly ill-equip- ped. The horeign Office have therefore asked us for a report on the present posi tion with regard to the diversion of traffic from Khorramshahr and the Karun to Bandar Shahpur and the railway. 3. It appears that the present enquiries arose out of a meeting which took place at Ahwaz early in September 1936, when a representative of Mespers, Mr. Wengo- borski of the Hansa Line and certain forwarding agents were summoned by the Governor-General to discuss the feasibility of bringing all Ahwaz through cargo by rail from Bandar Shahpur instead of by river from Khorramshahr. Later on the same day the Governor-General told Mr. Wengoborski that if his company would book through cargo to Ahwaz by rail, traffic on the Karun would be stopped. Mr. Wengoborski said that he must consult his head office in Bremen, and told Mespers that he was definitely against the proposal, so long as conditions at Bandar Shahpur remained as at present. 4. Y e do not appear to have heard before of this meeting at Ahwaz in Sep tember, nor have we recently heard anything to suggest that the Ahwaz customs house would shortly be closed, or that active measures would be taken to divert traffic from Khorramshahr and the Karun to Bandar Shahpur and the railway. On the other hand we have seen reports in the press of work on the quay at Khor ramshahr to improve landing facilities there. It is certain that Bandar Shahpur is quite incapable of dealing with the present volume of traffic, while we hear that Khorramshahr is so busy that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had to help by un loading and assembling heavy lorries at Abadan and by organizing unloadings at Khorramshahr. As long as this state of things continues, it seems most un likely that the Ahwaz customs will be closed. 5. We should be very grateful if you could let us have a report on the position in an official despatch, and in particular could let us have :— (i) any information about the possibility of the Ahwaz customs beirg closed : MC184EAD78 {ii) your views of the effect which the closure of the Ahwaz customs, if carried through, would have— i.e., would it really tend to divert traffic to the railway ? (Hi) any information about other measures to divert traffic from Khorram- shahr to Bandar Shahpur. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay at the Foreign Office. (Signed) D. P. REILLY for P. N. LOXLEY. (55) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 263, dated the 14th July 1937. I have the honour to enclose herewith a record of a conversation between the Military Attache to this Legation and the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs. Colonel Pybus had previously discussed with me the two points which he put before Doctor Naji-el-Asil, and in speaking as he did. he had my full concurrence. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, No. 118 and to His Majesty’s Ambassa dor at Baghdad No. 46. I renewed my acquaintance with Doctor Naji-el-Asil at the Iraqi reception on July oth. I asked him to spare me a few minutes as there were two matters about which I wanted to talk to him. By way of a sighting shot I congratulated him on his appointment and said it did not surprise me as I never thought that Counsellor in Tehran would be the culminating point in his career. This having produced quite an audible purr, I went on to suggest that the Iraqis should appoint a military attache to Iran'. The advantages, as I saw them, were :— M The present close and friendly relations between Iraq and Iran called for such an appointment. (ii) The presence of an Iraqi military attache might, conceivably, facilitate the settlement of those frontier disputes in which encroachments and high handed actions by small parties of troops were alleged to be the cause as opposed to those which arose out of the narauding habits of tribesmen or acts of brigandage. (m) The presence of an Iraqi military attache in Tehran might better the lot of the rest of the fraternity. At present, as Doctor Naji doubtless knew, the Turk ish military a.ttache was taken everywhere and shewn everything, while the re maining military attaches were treated as social lepers. If an Iraqi were appointed the Iranians would be bound to accord him equal treatment with the Turk and might even eventually extend this favoured treatment to the remainder. If they did the former and not the latter, there was still the advantage that I should have two well-informed sources to draw on instead of one. (iv) The Iraqi Government would find the military attache useful in calming the (apparently ) shattered nerves of their politicians and allaying their fears of Iranian aggression by authoritative denials of those all too frequent and all too stupid rumours that three divisions of Iranian troops, were massed here with belli cose intentions or that 100 aeroplanes were drawn up in readiness elsewhere lor a bombing raid on Baghdad. At present it fell to my lot to receive and deny these fantastic stories and occasionally'to receive requests for information concerning communications to the trontier and the location and numbers of Iranian troops there. Though I was of course, always ready to help, I did not relish the idea of incurring additional suspicion by acting as honorary military attache to Iraq. These reasons seemed to impress him and he said he agreed with me as to tte advisabihty of the appointment but forsaw a difficulty in providing a suitable . replied thai, surely in the whole of the Iraq army a suitable officer could ^ T d T P0 Tf d of , some tact &gt; and a working knowledge of French and Person. Had he, I said, brought up another objection, I could have understood it, namely,79 that three years ago when his Minister in Tehran had proposed the appointment he had been told by Monsieur Kazemi that it was not necessary and would not be welcome. If, therefore, the Iraqi Government did not wish to incur the risk of a second rebuff I could well understand it. Doctor Naji said that he remembered the occasion but had no fears on that score now as, after all the protestations of brotherly love which the Iranians had made in the past week, they could not de cently maintain Monsieur Kazemi’s attitude. He promised to take the matter up with the Minister of Defence on his return. The other matter I wanted to mention was, I said, that of frontier commissars. Did the Iraqis find the system satisfactory ? The Government of India had dis liked the idea but the Iranian Government would doubtless try and bring it up again and if they could say that the Governments of Russia, Turkey, Iraq and Afghanistan all liked the scheme, it would be more difficult for the Govern ment of India to turn it down. Dr. Naji said that it had not worked well and the Iraqis did not term their officials £ frontier commissars ’ ; they were called “ mutasarrifs ” and if the Iranian Government persisted in calling them frontier commissars, it did not worry him unduly. I said that we were, I think, talking at cross purposes and that what I meant was how did his Government like the idea of their consuls being short- circuited in the matter of frontier incidents as ours were in East Persia. The Iranian Government would not allow their frontier officials to notify our consuls of such incidents. These consuls were in touch with British officials on the Indian side of the frontier and could often effect speedy settlement of minor acts of theft of, say, a camel. In spite of this the Iranian Government preferred to refer the complaint through the circuitous channel of Tehran-London, or even Geneva, by which time the stolen camel had probably died of old age. Doctor Naji laughed heartily and said he entirely agreed and was going to say more when the Minister of Foreign Affairs came up. I judged it expedient to ter minate the conversation then. (56) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 276, dated the 17th July 1937. With reference to your telegram to Lieutenant-Colonel Fraser-Tytler No. 61- Secret of the 17th June, I have the honour to inform you that the Counsellor at this Legation took the opportunity of a talk with Captain Walker of Messrs. Haw kers Limited to enquire what he believed to be the position with regard to the German air service through Iran. Captain Walker replied that his impression was that German plans had advanced pretty far in Iran and Iraq. A representative of the Lufthansa is now virtually attached to the German Legation here, and another German air expert from Kabul was in Tehran last week. They told Cap tain Walker that they had found an exit not more than 9,000 feet high from North East Afghanistan, but that the lap from Kabul would have to be a very long one. Captain Walker expects another big German aeroplane here in a few weeks' time and thinks that the series of propaganda flights will continue until plans are still further advanced. His own aerodrome at Doshan Tappeli is a good natural all- weather one, which could easily be made a really good airport. Captain Walker believes that the German Legation derive satisfaction from their knowledge of this fact. 2.

I have the honour to inform you that General Amanullah Jehanbani (Per sonalities in Iran No. 102) has been dismissed from his post of Head of the Depart ment of Industry and Mines. It is not known for certain why he has again fallen from favour. But the rumour which has found most favour in Tehran is that he incurred the Shah’s displeasure by approaching him, at the request of the French Minister, in connection with some matter affecting the officers of the French Mili tary Mission. An officer of the mission has, however, told me that there is no truth in this report. General Jehanbani is a Kajar and an officer of some distinction. It is not the first time that he has fallen from favour. 2. His place at the Department of Industry and Mines has been taken by Mon sieur Moussa Noury Esfandiary (Personalities in Iran No. 75). The whole of Mon sieur Noury Esfandiary’s career has been passed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Diplomatic Service. He does not appear to be a man of any great ability or forcefulness, and his appointment to this important post is surprising.4'Z- 81 3. I was recently told by the Prime Minister, who has hitherto retained his former post of Minister of the Interior, that Monsieur Abolghassem Ferouhar (Per sonalities in Iran No. 83) has been selected for the post of Acting Minister of the Interior. Monsieur Ferouhar’s recent career affords an excellent example of the changes and chances of the life of an official in this country. A year ago he went from being Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance to be Iranian Minister in Paris. He was recalled in January owing to the appearance in the French press of articles objectionable to the Shah, and on his return he was for a short time im prisoned. Subsequently he w T as appointed Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from which comparatively unimportant post he is apparently to become a member of the Cabinet. 4.

With reference to Mr. Butler’s semi-official letter to Mr. Rendel of the 22nd May, I have the honour to inform you that there seems no doubt that while the Shah was in Mazanderan last month a considerable number of arrests and some executions were carried out, and that there was a conspiracy of some sort against His Imperial Majesty’s life. MC184EAD82 2. Reports have proved difficult to substantiate, but it now seems that there were two affairs. The first was a beginning, mainly among students and in parti cular among past and present members of the Technical School, until recently under a German head, to start something in the nature of a Nazi movement in Iran. This was reported by the Soviet Embassy to the Iranian authorities and arrests were made. 3. Secondly, there was a conspiracy against the Shah’s life, and four army officers from a regiment quartered in Tehran were implicated and all four executed. Another version is that two of them escaped to Russia. Russian money is believed in some quarters to have been connected with the plot, but as to this I am sceptical; nor have I been able to learn the motives and intentions of the conspirators, except to take the Shah’s life. 4. One fact that seems certain is that these alarums have given a good deal of anxiety to the police. ( 62 ) Letter from the British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 247, dated the 3rd July 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 183 of May 20th transmitting a copy of a memorandum prepared by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr on the subject of the formation of the monopolistic Iranian Landing Company known as the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch by Captain Bazalgette reporting on the progress made during the first two months of its existence. 2. Although the company appears to have made a good start, it is as yet early to say whether its continued operation will prove satisfactory and in particular whether the new agreement mentioned in paragraph 2 of Captain Bazalgette’s despatch between the Company and the Customs will give satisfaction to the vari ous shipping agents concerned. Enclosure to Serial No. (62). Letter from the British Vice-Consulate, Khorramshahr, to His Majesty’s Consul for Khuzistan, Ahwaz, No. 9/11/879, dated the 22 nd May 1937. I have the honour to submit the following report on the progress made by the Shirkat Kashtirani Karun during its first two months as a monopolistic landing company. 2. Contrary to expectation, the Shirkat is now functioning with creditable efficiency and economy. The new agreement approved by the Central Customs Authorities has not yet been published in Khorramshahr, but the Shirkat now admits its liabilities and responsibilities for cargo in its charge. Foreign Shipping Agents are satisfied with the “ boat-note ” receipts signed by the Shirkat’s repre sentative, and so far no disputes have arisen, except for the outstanding receipt for the S. S. ‘‘ Bandar Shahpur ” (my telegram No. 14 of 14th April 1937). 3. The success achieved by the Shirkat is largely due to the co-operation and help instituted this month by the Director of Customs, presumably as the result of orders from Tehran. Space has been found for cargoes where it was alleged there was no space before. Barges are unloaded into the Customs sometimes even the same day as the discharge of cargo from merchant ships. Such speed and efficiency is almost unprecedented. This economy in lighterage enables barges to carry many times their previous monthly capacity, allowing the few available craft to cope with the cargo arriving and making a considerable saving per ton of cargo landed. Up to date there have been no delays to merchant ships on account of barge shortage. 4. In spite of the present success, it is too soon to say that it will be permanent. A few months ago it was thought that the Khorramshahr Customs Compound were already filled to capacity. Comparatively little merchandise has been cleared and forwarded up-country, although the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran tells me that his bank are doing considerable business in advances for the clearance of goods, but some time must elapse before the accumulation of years is cleared.83 5, further, I understand that in spite of a large office staff, the Shirkat has no proper system of accounting or office routine. Apart from Mirza Jellal Movaugher himself, the khirkat has only two men with any experience of Shipping. The remainder may be classed as hangers-on. Hiranand Hingorani, who was at one time with the Mesopotamia Iran Corporation, Ltd., and was dismissed under a ^ cloud, confines himself to superintending the unloading of cargo at the ship’s side. A great deal of the efficiency of the Shirkat is due to his hard work, and it is un- tortunate that he has been seldom able to keep straight in the past. The other Aavidi (see para. 4 of my despatch No. 9/11/243 of 27th February 1937) has barely started work for the Shirkat, and although Mr. Spence and Mr. Battey report him tiii a J° 0d m 1 ter P reter and routine clerk, he is not said to be an accountant. Mirza Jellal Movaugher has been trying to enrol Mr. Z. H. Khan, late of African and Ji/astern (A ear East) Limited, but the latter appears to be waiting and watching before committing himself, although he has held charge of Mirza Jellal Movau&lt;ffi- . er s private affairs during his recent visit to Tehran. Mirza Jellal Movaucffier ap pears to see the weakness of the position, and has asked Messrs. African and East ern (xM ear East) Limited to help him to engage a cadre of trained shipping clerks in Basra. ® 6. Finally, the new agreement requires interpretation and Mr. Battey tells me that difficulties are likely to arise between the Customs, Shirkat, and Foreign Shipping Agents unless the details are settled in a spirit of give and take. ( 63 ) Despatch prom the British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No, 361, dated the 30th July 1937. His Majesty’s Legation present their compliments to the Imperial Ministry of foreign Affairs and have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Consular De partments note-verbale No. 18036 of the 19th July (28th Tir 1316) requesting that twenty days notice may be given m applications for permission for flights 0 over Iranian territory. ° 2, As the Consular Department are aware, in the great majority of cases per mission for the flignt of British aircraft over Iranian territory is no longer sought . ir0ll § 1 Dis Majesty s Legation. In the case of flights starting in the United King- dome, permission is obtained through the Imperial Iranian Legation in London^ m that of flights originating in India, it is obtained through the Imperial Consul- general at Delhi. Permission is now usually only sought through His Majesty’s Legation for flights starting in Australia, or occasionally in the Straits Settlements or elsewhere m the Far East. It will be appreciated that in view of the great dis tance involved, owing to delay in the post or other causes, His Majesty’s Legation may from time to time receive instructions to obtain permission for a flight too late to give as much as 20 days’ notice. Every effort will however be made to apply for permission at least twenty days in advance, and the Imperial Govern ment s desire to receive twenty days’ notice is being brought to the attentio i of the authorities concerned.

Copies to F 0 No. 255 ; India No. 113 : Bushire No. 54, dated the 7th July 1937. ^ c Dear Consulate. Your letter No. 22/16/81 of April 25th about British Indians who take out Iranian “ sijjils 2. To take the legal aspect first, we do not think that the mere fact of a person, who is undoubtedly a British subject to start with, taking out an Iranian “ sijjil ” can in any way deprive that person of British nationality unless at the same time all the formalities prescribed by the laws in force for the renunciation of British and the acquisition of Iranian nationality have been completed. 3. We therefore consider that Bazalgette was perfectly correct in continuing to recognise the British nationality of such persons. In the past we have had many instances of “ sijjils ” being forced on British subjects, e.g., the Charbar Khojaz, and in such cases the police definitely claimed them as Iranian subjects usually, however, on the grounds that they had been born in Iran. In the case of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company employees, we imagine it could generally be proved without difficulty that they had been born in India and that there could be no ques tion of their being Iranian subjects by birth. Once that point was gained, the Iranian Gfovemment could scarcely argue that the mere taking out of a sijjil constituted naturalisation as an Iranian subject. 4. From a more practical point of view, we are quite content to let the matter remain as it is until some question of the grant of an exit visa or of conscription brings it to a head. We do not see much harm in this mild swindle from which all parties concerned appear to derive some benefit. At the same time we think the Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr should be careful not to give it any encouragement and should warn any British subjects who are contemplating taking out Iranian “ sijjils ” fraudulently that such action may cause complications for them with the Iranian authorities. Yours ever, CHANCERY. PS, We are sending copies of this letter to His Majesty’s Principal Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs No. 255, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. 113 and to the Honourable the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 54. (65) Letter from the British Vice-Consulate, Khorramshahr, to His Majesty’s Consul for Khozistan, Ahwaz, No. 18/12/700, dated the 22 nd April 1937. I have the honour to forward, herewith, a list of British Indian Subjects, who have been reported to me confidentially to have taken “ sijjils ”. 2. All these men were recruited by Messrs, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, in India some years ago, and worked on Indian “ Contracts ” in the first place. When the new agreement between the Iranian Government and Messrs, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, came into force, these men knew that they were likely to be replaced by Iranians. In order to keep their employment they themselves became “ Iranians ” by purchasing “sijjils” from the Abadan Police. Several men have stated to me that they were advised to take out sijjils by senior Europeans in the Company, in order to avoid their replacement by untrained Iranians. Messrs, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd., have admitted to me that this is highly probable, and I have every reason, but no proof, to believe that it is true. So far as I can ascertain they did not comply with the Regulations govern ing the Law of Nationality forwarded under cover of Tehran Circular No. 17 of19th August 1935 or Article 983 of the Iranian Civil Code forwarded under cover of your endorsement No. 891 of 27th May 1935. I understand that “ sijjils ” can be purchased from the police clerk for a few Tomans. They did not surrender their British Passports or report their renunciation of British Nationality to this Vice-Consulate, nor did the Iranian Authorities make such a report. 3. Several of these men are now due for discharge and naturally want to re turn to their homes. Two problems have arisen. Firstly, on account of the Foreign Exchange restrictions, Messrs, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Ltd., are unable to give gratuities, back pay, etc. in rupees to men on “ Iranian Contracts ”. Second ly, the local passport authorities refuse to give them Iranian Passports. 4. At my suggestion, Messrs, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, are considering paying them the portion of their settlement money due for their time on Indian Contracts in rupees on arrival in Bombay, and the balance in rials. Messrs, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, can be relied upon to do all in their power to help their employees, even after discharge. This question, too, is of little importance unless the men return to India. 5. When the men apply to me to give them travel facilities to return to India, there are two courses open to me. One may take the view that the man volun tarily renounced his British Nationality in order to keep his employment, and has benefitted thereby. He should, therefore, take the consequences of his action and remain an Iranian subject. On the other hand there is little doubt that a certain number were advised by their European superiors to take out sijjils to save the Company losing skilled labour. Others, too, have followed this advice given to their friends. It seems somewhat unjust that these British Indians should suffer from taking the advice of their European superiors. 6. I have, therefore, taken the view that those men who were unquestionably British Indian Subjects when they came to Iran, are still British Subjects unless they have carried out the Regulations governing the Law of Iranian Nationality and Article 983 of the Iranian Civil Code. As their British Passports have not been surrendered to me, and no notification of their Nationality has been given to me by the Iranian Authorities and as they have made no valid declaration of aliena tion in accordance with para. 13 of Chapter XXV of the Consular Instructions I maintain that they have not renounced their British Nationality. If their British Passports are still valid I make the usual entry for a single journey to India, and in other cases issue Emergency Certificates. So far there have been 3 cases, and up to date there has been no difficulty in obtaining police exit visas and leaving the country. 7. I would request that I may be informed if my action is correct.

With further reference to your Circular despatch, No. 5 (119/1/37) of January 16th last and to my despatch, No. 5 (87/5/2/7) of February 6, I have the honour to submit herewith a report on Economic Conditions in Fars. 2. The Summary of Events and Conditions in Fars during the year 1936 trans mitted with my despatch under reference contains sections on agriculture (para graphs 27—33) and on economic affairs (paragraph 38—49) which I have endeav oured to bring up to date in the accompanying report from such scant sources of information as are at my disposal here. Enclosure II to Serial No. (71). Report on Economic Condition in the Province of Fars in July 1937. The Province of Fars owes such prosperity as it enjoys predominantly to its agricultural resources. The establishment of cotton spinning mills and of a sugar refinery and the demand for cotton to supply the Isfahan mills have only partly compensated the serious losses to the province consequent on the discontinuance of opium production, which was the chief source of revenue formerly. Not only has the export trade in this commodity almost entirely ceased, on orders from Teh ran, but all other agricultural products, gums, almonds, and dried fruits and carpets and skins are now handled by various Monopoly Companies in which the Govern ment has an interest sufficient to give them control. As a result it is generally believed that production has decreased as individual profit becomes more difficult of attainment. But it is not possible to obtain accurate statistics of crops and supplies, and it becomes increasingly difficult even to estimate the volume of ex ports under the present system of centralisation of trade in the Capital. The tribal disturbances which were not completely put down until five or six years ago resulted in Fars falling into disfavour with the General Government and not receiving until recently the attention and support it merited. Its wealth in the past was derived from its agricultural products, most of which are now' being controlled by interests centred in Tehran and the surplus over-production costs goes to the Capital, whereas formerly it remained in the Province. For similar reasons, the industrial development of Shiraz has not been so rapid as was at one time expected, as capital is not available and initiative killed once it is realised that profits are to be deflected elsewhere. Thus the largest cotton mill has abandoned all idea of extension for the present and other schemes for textile factories, cement works, and various industrial undertakings are m abeyance for the time being. The result is continued disfavour in the eyes of Government.T 88 The Director of the Finance Department, the local managers of most of the Monopoly Companies and various of the leading industrialists and notables ac companied the Governor General ofFars to Tehran recently to take part in discus sions on future economic developments. It was confidently hoped outside Govern ment circles that there might be modifications in official policy, but nothing is known as yet. There will be much satisfaction if the future policy of the Government allows a greater measure of profit to local interests. Agriculture —- Production of all crops is now to a large extent dependent on orders from the Agricultural Department and on the efforts of Government controlled organisa tions such as the Sherket-i-Panbeh (Cotton Monopoly Company), Sherket-i-Khoshk- bar (Dried Fruits Monopoly Company), Sherket-i-Pust Narni (Skin Monopolv Company), and Sherket-i-Ketirah (gum Monopoly Company). In general, rain crops have been a failure this year, as there has been no rain since the beginning of March. It is feared that returns will barely compensate for seed sown. Estimates of grain crops were as follows :— Wheat 100,000 kharvars ; barley 50,000 kharvars : sesame 300—400 khar- vars, of which half might be exported. None of these estimates have been realised, but exact details of the crops available cannot be obtained. Formerly the villagers and tribesmen used to visit Shiraz to barter their agri cultural and dairy produce for sugar, tea and piece-goods. The foundation of village co-operative societies is beginning to put an end to this, as these societies deal directly with the various Monopoly Companies who are more and more getting control of distribution. The total area under cultivation in Fars is said to be about 800,000 hectares. The chief crops are cotton, sugar beet and wheat. Unless extensive irrigation can be carried out it is doubtful whether much more land can profitably be used. Ex perts have examined the possibility of sinking artesian wells in various districts, but for the present irrigation depends on antiquated methods of drawing water from wells by hand labour or with bullocks. There are also plans under consider- tion for irrigating the Merv Dasht Plain by a dam at Ramgerd, on the Bandi-i- Amir River, and for irrigation in the Kazerun districts by a dam on the Shahpur River. Cotton .—Last years crop amounted to nearly 6 million kilogrammes, which was absorbed in the mills of Shiraz and Isfahan. A cotton ginning plant is now working in Shiraz and others have been installed at Kazerun and at Fasa. The machinery is American. More is said to have been planted this year, especially in the Kazerun and Fasa districts, but crop estimates are only given as 15,000 khar vars (about 5 million kilogrammes). All sowing is under the supervision of the Sherket-i-Panbeh, which supplies seed, and large advances have been made by the Agricultural Bank against crops. 20,000 hectares are said to be under cotton cultivation in Fars. The Company has branches in Shiraz, Abadeh, Fasa, Darab, Firuzabad, Kazerun and Mamessani. The Company is doing good work in in creasing the quantity and quality of cotton produced, but their efforts in dis tributing it have not been so successful. The Shiraz mills complain that they cannot always get the type of cotton which they require and that too much is sent to Isfahan. Sugar frert.—The refinery at Merv Dasht commenced production in the autumn of 1936. During the first refining season over 40,000 tons of beet were used, all grown in the neighbourhood. According to statistics published by the Banque Melli, 1132 hectares were under cultivation in the Iranian year 1314 and 2,500 hec tares in 1315, producing in all 43,351 tons of beet, which is the largest production in any district, in Iran with the exception of Shahi in Mazanderan. The refinery turned out 5,866,516 kilogrammes of sugar from the crop of the two years combined, which shows a yield of 14-65% of sugar. (The yield ought to be up to 18%, accord ing to expert calculation). Most of the beet is grown in the Merv Dasht Plain, but all round Shiraz sugar beet is being sown, as it is found to be a profitable crop. The factory pays the cultivator 30 dinars per man for his beet.Grain. —The crops estimated in the beginning of the year for Fars were 100,000 kharvars (32,700 metric tons) of wheat and 50,000 kharvars (16,350 metric tons) of barley. There are grain warehouses in Shiraz capable of storing 140,000 kharvars. At the beginning of 1936 there were said to be 60,000 kharvars of wheat in Shiraz, but it has been necessary since then to make large purchases in Hamadan and Isfa han. It is proposed to construct a large modern grain silo. All wheat is purchased by the Government Grain Stabilising Department at fixed prices. In the early part of the year 300 rials per kharvar was being paid. The Military Department has recently been taking all available supplies of barley, straw and other fodder, and other consumers must obtain a permit from the military authorities which is usually granted when Army needs have been satisfied. Opium. —The cultivation of poppies for opium production in Fars was stopped by order of the Government after the partial failure of last years crop. This causes considerable loss to the Province and to Shiraz merchants, which is not compensat ed by the cultivation of cotton and wheat which are supposed to be grown as sub stitutes. A small quantity is still grown for poppy seed, estimated to produce 6,000 kharvars, most of which has been exported. Rice. —The cultivation of rice has also been stopped almost entirely through out the Province by orders from Tehran. Fruit. —Almonds, oranges and citrous fruits and dates are grown in various parts of the Province in quantities sufficient for export to other parts of the country or abroad. The trade in all dried fruits and nuts is in the hands of the Sherket-i- Khoshkbar. Gum Tragacanth. —The Sherket-i-Ketirah arranges for collection of gum and export is permitted by merchants under licence from the Company. The trade is a valuable one in Shiraz. Lambskins. —The export of Iranian skins was formerly of great importance in Shiraz. This year, under the control of the Sherket-i-Pust Narm, most of the local supplies have been sent to Tehran. Cattle and flocks .—A veterinary Service has been organised by the Agricul tural Department with an Austrian doctor in charge for inspection of cattle, sheep and goats. Industrial undertakings. — The most important of the newly established industries in Shiraz is cotton spinning. The Fars Manufacturing Company, Limited, directed and organised at that time by Hussein Agar, of the firm of Hadji Ali Akbar, of Manchester, in 1934 open ed a mill of 5,736 spindles with spinning machinery supplied by Messrs. Platt Brothers, of Oldham, electric motors and accessories by the General Electric Com- pany, Ltd., and a power plant with diesel engines by Mirrlees, Bickerton and Day, Ltd. This mill produces cotton yarn of 10 and 20 counts. Its average daily out put during 1936 was 500 bundles of 10 lbs. each working three shifts daily with 450 employees. Production has decreased recently and the mill at present only works on two shifts with 300 employees. The selling price of yarn at the beginning of 1937 was Rials 60—70 per bundle. Later on, it dropped to Rials 45. A build ing was completed for new spinning machinery to be supplied by the same firm, but the order has been cancelled and no extension is contemplated for the present, as there were at one time large stocks of yarn on hand and overproduction was feared if the output increased. Part of the capital has been returned to the share holders and the advance instalment paid against delivery of the new machinery was refunded by the manufacturers. Early in the year there were strikes for more pay, and better treatment and more recently two of the three English engineers employed by the firm have left their service. During the first two years of working big profits were made by the Company which last year declared a dividend of 66%. This is not surprising, since the price they formerly got for their yarn was three times the cost of Japanese yarn of the same quality c. i. f. Bushire. MC184EAD90 4nother mill of 4,000 spindles is operated by the Dehkan Brothers who also own the Pars Electric Company Power Plant on adjoining premises. This mill Equipped with German spinning machinery, the driving power being supplied from tlm Power Station with two Mirrlees engines of 130 H. 1 ■ each and a German /t&gt; 7 \ p n m n e of 500 H.P. and alternators by the British Ihomson Houston Com pany' The mill commenced production of 30-count yarn in the Spring o 1937. Ft therefore does not compete with the older established mill. It is only working on one shift with 180 employees. A permit for another mill to have 6,000 spindles was obtained by the Dehkan Brothers in 1936, but building has not yet commenced. Six sets of cotton ginning machinery have been ordered from the limited States of America, and two have been erected in Shiraz and in Kaserun. They are to be operated by the Sherket-i-Panbeh which has branches at various centres in the Province. The Government was understood to be contemplating the establishment of a large mill for weaving cotton print at Shiraz but exchange difficulties have held this up. Sugar refinery.—In 1934, the Ministry of Agriculture commenced the construc tion of a sugar factory at Merv Dasht, some 25 miles to the north of Shiraz. Ihe work was later handed over to a Swedish firm of contractors and completed. Machinery has been supplied by the Skode Works, including two 750 H.P. engines and three 250 sq. metre boilers. Beetroot has been sown in the surrounding plain and in many other districts around Shiraz. The factory pays the cultivator 30 dinars per man for his beet, which makes it a profitable crop. 1 lie Government, which owns the factory, has made large profits. During the season ending in the winter of 1936-37, 40,000 tons of beet were used yielding 7,200 tons of sugar. It is said, however, that this costs 200% more to produce than European sugar c. i. f. Bushire. Local sugar was on the market at a price slightly lower than imported sugar for a few months, but it has now been replaced by Russian sugar. Weaving. —In addition to the old carpet industry of Shiraz, a small Company was floated recently by the Agricultural Bank under the style of Sherket-i-Sanayi- Dasti (Handicraft Co.), which has imported fifty hand-weaving looms from India, which it is proposed to sell to weavers on the instalment plan, payment being effect ed by the products of the looms. Wine making. —Another small Company floated by the Agricultural Bank is the Sherket-i-Khollar, which manufactures wine and spirits in a modern factory. The output is sufficient for local requirements. A German engineer is in charge. Electric poiver and lighting. —The town of Shiraz is well lighted by Fars Electric Company, whose plant is furnished with Mirrlees Diesel engines. Another similar engine has been ordered and is at present in the Customs at Bushire. The require ments of the cotton mill, already mentioned, and of the Municipality wi\\ give a twenty-four hour demand for power, which would enable a day and night service to be maintained for other consumers. At present the Company is under contract to the Municipality to supply a ten-hour service through the night. The price per unit was reduced from Rials 5 to Rials 3- 50 at the No Rouz. Projected industrial undertakings. —Plans have been considered for a Govern ment cement factory, a pottery factory, and for soap and perfumery works. State undertakings and public utilities .— First in order of importance amongst Public Works are the extensive Army barracks, which have been completed this year. They house six thousand soldiers and are said to have cost 50 million rials. For some time the building has given employment to many of the idle population of the town and surrounding districts. The Ministry of Education is building an expensive monument in granite near the Tomb of the Poet Hafiz. The old site, known as the Hafizieh, has been pulled down and is being rebuilt with a gallery supported on twenty imposing stone columns overlooking grounds laid out with fountains and flower beds. The cemetery extending from the Hafizieh to the River has been enclosed with a wall and laid out as a public garden, the grave stones being used to build terraces.91 The Municipality works spasmodically on the four main roads cutting through the town. The one from west to east is half completed and the one from north to south, starting from the once famous Koran Gate, has reached the Isfahan Gate at the entrance to the old Bazaars. The widening of the latter road necessi tated the demolition of the Koran Gate and it is intended to widen the bridge over the river. The Khiaban Zand, claimed to be the finest and widest avenue in the country, has been extended eastwards to Mahalle Darb Shehzade, cutting through the Gov ernment buildings in the old Fortress and the Bazaar Vakil. Work was stopped for a time on this, but recently began again and is now in progress. Another road, parallel to the Khiaban Zand, has been extended westwards to the garden quarter of Shiraz, known as Masjid-i-Bardi, and is completed as far as Khollar Wine Factory. The continuation of this road, which is in fair condi tion, leads to Ardakan and to Tul-i-Khosrovi, a new town in Kuhgilu district which is being built as a tribal centre. The only provincial road on which any appreciable work has been carried out recently is the Shiraz-Kazerun-Bushire road. Repairs were carried out on certain parts of this road in anticipation of the passage of the Shah. The new route to Bushire via Jahrum-Firuzabad, is still far off completion. In the dry season it is fairly good as far as Jahrum. There is opposition to its con tinuation from the inhabitants of Kazerunk but the alignment is superior, there being no difficult passes to get over. The main road to Isfahan is maintained in fair condition. For some years, it is said, the expenditure of the Municipality has exceeded its income. It would appear that some check has recently been placed upon this, for various works in hand have been stopped and left in an unfinished condition. A part of the Bazaar is in ruins through the road construction work already mentioned. All vacant plots of land in the vicinity of the town have been surrounded by walls in order to give the town a finished appearance. Work is proceeding slowly on a new Muni cipal Hospital. The building in the Government fortress garden, known as the Kolah Faranghi, has been renovated and is used as a Museum. A technical school has been organised during the last twelve months with two Germans to teach engineering and mechanics. Night classes for adults are being attended in various schools in fairly large numbers and arrangements for weekly lectures have been made. The standard of education and also of teaching is im proving gradually. The town lighting has already been mentioned. It is satisfactory and com pares favourably in price to the public with that in other towns in Iran. The Shiraz Telephone Company maintains a service, with Siemens apparatus, under the regulations of the Postal Department. It is as good as is usual in this country. The postal and telegraph services are maintained fairly satisfactorily trans port of mail being given out on contract by the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Foreign Trade .— The principal imports to Shiraz are piece-goods, sugar and tea. The first named is entirely in the hands of the Sherket-i-Qumash, which opened two shops in the Spring and sold cotton goods to the public at lower prices than had been ob tainable before by shopkeepers in the bazaar. Small retail merchants have since been supplied by the Company, but they are only permitted to sell at a fixed profit. The Sherket-i-Ghand va Sheker disposes of all products of Iranian sugar fac tories and also imports and distributes sugar, mostly of Russian origin. The Com pany also controls the Sherket-i-Chai, which similarly handles all trade in tea. Most other imported articles are handled by the Sherket-i-Tijaret-i-Fars va Banader, which is 86% owned by the Government through the Agricultural Bank’s participation, and which itself owns shares in other Companies engaged in export and import trade. The exports from Shiraz are mainly gum tragacanth, lambskins, dried fruits and almonds, and carpets. These are now all handled by Monopoly Companies in which the Government has some measure of control.92 Petitions are said to have been presented to the Shah, when he visited Shiraz in the Spring, with a view to a revision of policy with regard to these Companies and a deputation also visited Tehran. The organisation of such Companies now depends largely on decisions arrived at in the Capital and much of the profit is at tracted there. Private trade is only possible under permit from the Company concerned. So much depends upon Government credit and foreign exchange policy that it is not possible to predict what the future of foreign trade will be. The Banks have been restricting credit to the utmost since the death of the late Minister of Finance, which was expected to result in important changes of Government policy with regard to commercial and economic matters. Social — The population of Pars is said to beTown of Shiraz 120,000 ; villages out side Shiraz 80,000 ; tribesmen 200,000 ; making a total of 400,000. The popula tion of the town has increased considerably in the last few years owing to arrivals from the outlying districts in search of employment. Public health is on the whole good. Municipal Health services are under efficient management. Efforts have been made to reduce the numbers of beggars. The slaughter-houses are combined with a Sanitary Inspection Office with an Austrian veterinary doctor in charge under the Agricultural Department. Education is making good progress, particularly amongst the illiterate for whom night classes are arranged. The salaries of all teachers are much better than they used to be and in consequence a better standard of teacher is obtained. English and French are said to be more widely studied by women since the unveiling orders were put in force, and the new dress regulations undoubtedly stimulate the interest of all classes in European customs and peculiarities. Much attention is paid to athletics in the Schools and the Boy Scouts are a flourishing organisation. The small orphans from the Municipal Orphanage are taught to march about to the strains of martial music and drums. The cost of living is increasing. Since the beginning of the year there have been rises in the price of bread, rice, cooking fat and meat. The cost of fodder has also increased considerably and is likely to do so after the prolonged drought which has been experienced since February. % Enclosure to Serial No. (72). No. 564/6/37, 11th September 1937. Copy to :—Col. Parsons. Would you kindly refer to Library letter No. 5411/411/405 of August 20th about Doctor Iranow ? 2. Doctor Iranow, who has now arrived in Tehran, was only able to enter the country after a long delay in Baghdad, and even now there is some doubt whether he will be able to carry out his proposed tour. 3. The trouble all seems to have arisen from the fact that his passport des cribes him as a “ Journalist ” : because of this, the Iranian Consul in Baghdad would not give him a visa without reference to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Tehran. The latter wrote to us asking if we could recommend him, and on the strength of a letter from Baghdad, which reached us shortly afterwards, giving details about Doctor Iranow and enclosing a list of his publications, I wrote a letter of recommendation in which I stressed the fact that Doctor Iranow would really be far more aptly described as a savant than a journalist, and suggested that Iranian experts must be familiar with his writings. This apparently failed to convince, and 12 days later an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs enquired verbally whether I would write a letter guaranteeing that Doctor Iranow would not publish any articles in the press unfavourable to Iran : if I would do this, he said, a visa could be given to him at once. I replied that I had already given the Ministry the information I had about Doctor Iranow but I would give no guarantee, as I should have no means of controlling anything that Doctor Tranow might eventually write.■Hi 93 4. Tlie next we heard was that Doctor Iranow had arrived in Tehran. He called at the Consulate on September 7th and said that he hoped to see the Minister of Education, whom he has met before and get permission to make his tour. He has promised to let us know what progress he makes. 5. If Doctor Iranow’s manuscripts are heavy, there may be some delay in sending them all home, since our bags are limited in weight. But I imagine that there will be no great hurry. (Signed) H. J. SEYMOUR. Sin Stephen Gaselee, K.C.M.G., C.B.E., The Foreign Office. ( 73 ) Letter prom His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 35S-E., dated 10 th September 1937. I have the honour to inform you that according to the “ Journal de Teheran ” of the 2nd September, the Banque Mellie Iran intend to open twenty-three new branches in the provinces: these would bring the number of provincial offices up to sixty-five. 2. The article ends with the remark that the establishment of these sixty-five branches shows a satisfactory economic and financial situation which calls for expansion of the bank in order to facilitate current transactions, 3. Competent opinion considers that the Banque Mellie is overdoing it bv opening branches in such small places as are now being selected, and regards the programme as “ window-dressing ”. The places are in some cases villages of no importance whatever, and it is difficult to believe that banking facilities are needed % the inhabitants. 4.

( 74 ) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 349, dated 6 th September 1937. In my despatch No. 296 of July 31st, I reported the appointment of Monsieur Moussa Noury Esfandiary as Director-General of the Department of Industry and and Mines. His tenure of the post for which, as I observed, he had no obvious qualifications, only lasted some three weeks, when he was dismissed and replaced by Seyyid Mehdi Farrokh, formerly Governor of Western Azerbaijan. 2. Monsieur Noury Esfandiary is generally believed to have been made the scapegoat for a muddle which occurred shortly after his appointment and for which he can hardly have had any responsibility. It had been arranged that the official opening of the new silk factory at Chalus should be attended by the Shah and the majority of the Cabinet. The foreign experts had consistently reported that the factory was not yet ready to function properly, but the opening date, once fixed, could apparently not be postponed. The result of the function was naturally disappointing and Monsieur Noury Esfandiary had to bear ihe blame. He is, however, not of sufficient eminence for this setback to be likely permanently to affect him. 3.

(76) Letter from the British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 304, dated 7th August 1937. Despatches from this Legation have from time to time reported on the frigi dity of the relations which have for some time existed between Iran and the United States and France. In each case the Shah had taken offence at Press articles ; The Iranian Legation in Washington has been closed for over a year, while the legation in Paris has been left without a Minister. 2. Persian resentment towards the United States (though it was not allowed to affect matters of business, such as the Amiranian Oil Concession) went so far that no American newspapers or publications were allowed to be delivered in Iran. An exception was, however, made in favour of certain technical publications, the non-delivery of which was found to cause serious inconvenience. When Mr. Engert arrived here as United States Charg6 d’Affaires, he found that even such innocuous periodicals as the volumes of the laws of the United States, journal of International Law and similar publications addressed to his Legation had been suppressed. No96 notification, had, Mr. Engert tells me, been made by the Persian Post Office to the American Post Office or to the Berne Bureau : everything had simply been retained by the Persian authorities and, he believes, mostly destroyed. As a result of strong representations made by Mr. Engert as to the illegality and futility of the Persian action, American publications are again being delivered and the relations between the two countries are to this extent improved. 3. In the case of France too it seems to have been decided that matters have gone far enough. Senator Honorat is at present in Iran on what is, I believe, a mission for the promotion of cultural relations. lie was first entertained at a Government banquet at which the speeches by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Senator were commendably short, merely recording the fact that no shade has ever clouded or ever can cloud the cordial relations which have always existed between the two cuntries. Subsequently Monsieur Honorat was received by the Shah, delivering to His Imperial Majesty a letter from the President of the French Republic and presenting the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. This was followed by an audience with the Valiahd. Finally, after a week-end at Isfahan, Monsieur Honorat was made Honorary Doctor of the University of Tehran, and entertained to dinner by the Minister of Public Instruc tion, to w T hom he presented in return the Medal of the University of Paris. 4. I should like to think that these developments indicate a diminished sensi tiveness to Press criticism, but it would in my opinion be over-optimistic to take such a view. Any foreign Press comment which appears to reflect on the Shah personally will, I fear, continue to produce the familiar reactions. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Washington and Paris No. 472/2/37.

Opinion in Tehran is now going through a period of some apprehension as to the prospects of the next few months. Anxiety is expressed for various reasons, ^ but the underlying causes of existing and anticipated difficulties are mainly financial. 2. There can be no doubt that the financial situation is becoming more and mere difficult, and signs of this are seen in the continual trouble which foreign experts are experiencing in securing payment of the foreign currency due to them under their contracts. No recent attempt has been made to repeat the demand made on the railway contractors to deposit foreign exchange to cover their rial loans, but I learn that the company undertaking the port works on the Caspian has been asked to cover their loans in this way. It is generally believed that the present position of the clearing with Germany shows a large debt from Iran to Germany (estimated at well over £l million), and the volume of imports from Germany has for the moment been reduced to very small proportions. On the other hand, I learn that the debt of the National Bank to the Imperial Bank of Iran has been reduced, though this reduction may only be temporary. A further feature which should be of advantage to the Iranian Government is the rise in the value of agricultural and other such products, but it appears doubtful whether the additional quantity of foreign exchange which should result from these increased values will be sufficient to make very much difference. 3. Another prospective burden on Iranian finance is the possibility, or even probabilitv, of further railway construction. I am informed that the Iranian Government have been making enquiries in Europe with a view to undertaking the construction of the Tabriz Railway. This, it is reported, will cost about £12 million, and I am informed on authority which should be good that a scheme for using the oil royalties as security for this expenditure has been mooted. It remains to be seen whether the country will be able to bear the further £12 million for railway construction on the top of the cost of equipping and maintaining the Trans-Iranian Railway, in addition to expenditure for military purposes, in which there is no discrimination. 4. The pledging of the oil royalties, if this is really under consideration, must adversely affect Iranian credit, at any rate for some time. Those who have done business with Iran on a large scale have felt that as a last resort there would be the oil royalties in the background, 5. In many parts of the country there is a good deal of nervousness about the food situation. Last winter the operations of the grain monopoly were not entirely well advised, and produced a shortage in East Iran at a time when the exceptionally heavy snow made it difficult to procure supplies from other parts of the country. This year the necessity for finding foreign exchange has again led to considerable exports while over a large area of the country lack of rain had led to short crops. The rice crop is also likely to be short, partly owing to artificial restriction of the area under this crop, partly owing to a poor season, and the price is already rising. Transport is also expected to present a serious problem ; the motor monopoly has been badly managed and the supply of lorries is insufficient to meet the increasing demands upon it. There has recently been some improvement, but much headway has to be made up before the transport svstem can inspire confidence. The mistakes made last year have naturally caused some uneasiness as to the prospects for the next winter, as many fear that exports have been so great as to reduce the available stocks to a dangerously low level. In the absence, however, of reliable statistics it is not possible to form an accurate view of the position. It does, however, seem probable that next winter will be a difficult one and that the ingenuity of the Government will be considerably taxed in meeting the problems of finance and supply which will have to be faced. The forebodings which I have summarised in the preceding paragraphs have, there is no doubt, increased the unpopularity of the present regime, but it is almost impossible under present conditions to imagine any effective opposition or even criticism of the Government policy. If bad times come they will have to be borne, but there is, no doubt, a large volume of opinion which holds that the burden which is being placed on the country is becoming almost intolerable.

Wlth reference to my despatch No. 349 of the 6th September, I have the honour to inform you that the Department of Industry and Mines and the Department of Commerce have now been raised to the status of ministries.

Letter from His Majesty s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London IMVw OQA 'T'v . O - /A ’ ^ ’ «oine rime must elapse Delore the details of the rising become known, it is clear that the reported submission of the Bahmais earlier in the summer can have been nominal only, and that they must be in possession of considerable quantities of arms. I he situation must be a cause of some anxietv to the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company as one of their new oilfields is situated not far from Behbehan. 4 It appears from a report from His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz that at the same time the Bahmais were rising on the Eastern side of the Kuhgilu district the Boir Ahmedi sub-tribe were engaging troops in the western Kuhgilu • they are reported to have inflicted a reverse on the troops who are being hastilv re-inforced trom Shiraz There are also rumours, unconfirmed as yet, current m“Tehran that the trouble has spread from the Kuhgilu to other Southern tribes and that Khamseh tribesmen have been attacking roadguard posts in the neighbourhood of Lar. 5. I shall not fail to inform you of further developments. Letter from His Majesty’s Mnister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, No. 391. No. 379, dated 7th October 1937. 2. At the same time two acting Ministers have been confirmed in their appoint hs IVlrmsipnr KQrl^vn oo tm: i at • -r^ , _ A&gt; cuutent in tne soutn is beginning once again to take active form. 3 ' ° n p t ^ e 25th an f 27th Se P tember &gt; however, His Majesty’s Vice Consul at dated 20th October 1937.at that Town, and that this had also been the case last year. Monsieur Ansarie said that the Iranian Government were astonished that a notice should be posted in Arabic, especially wdien it has been decided to purify the Persian language of Arabic words, and they thought the notice should have been in Persian, English or trench. Monsieur Ansarie asked that the matter might be investigated. 2. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, to whom the matter was referred, has in formed me that such a notice was in fact displayed in the gate-house of the Consulate. It was one of the usual Arabic translations of the ordinary notice distributed bv the Department of Overseas Trade to posts in the Near and Middle East. As vou are aware, the question of the Persian language and its script is one on which the Iranian Government are at present particularly sensitive. All signs and notices written in anything but Arabic script have been forbidden, and only recently the Government have published regulations, on which I am reporting separately, re quiring that all accounts and business correspondence should be in Persian. Al though there can be no doubt of a Consul’s right to displav in his own Consulate, notices in any language he wishes, in the circumstances, I think that it is desirable, that notices in Arabic should not be displayed at posts in this country except those at which there are likely to be non-Iranian, Arabic-speaking callers. As very few Iranians are likely to go to the British Industries fair, the Department of Overseas Trade will probably not consider it worth while to produce a Persian edition of the notices. In the absence of a Persian edition I think that the notices displayed in this country should normally be in English or French. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch which I am addressing to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in this country accordingly, together with a copy of a letter which is being sent to Monsieur Mohsen Rais, now in charge of the Third Political Department. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, unnumbered, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. 186 and to His Majesty’s Consular Representatives in Iran under cover of my Circular Despatch No. 33. Enclosure to Serial No. (84). Letter from the British Legation, Tehran, No. 33, dated 20th October 1937. I transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch which I am addressing to the Foreign Office regarding the display in this country of Arabic notices of the British Industries Fair. 2. In all the circumstances I think it desirable that such notices should only be displayed in English or French, except at those posts where it is reasonable to expect a fair number of non-Iranian Arabic-speaking callers. This is likely to be the case at Khorramshahr and possibly at Bushire, Bandar Abbas and Kermanshah, and I think that if it has been usual to display notices in Arabic at these posts, the practice should be continued. At other posts, subject to any instruction which may subsequently be received from the Foreign Office, notices should only be shewn in English or hrench. But if at any post other than the four enumerated above, the number of non-Iranian, Arabic-speaking callers is large enough to justify the display of Arabic notices, the fact should be reported to His Majesty’s Legation. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under cover of my despatch No. 391, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. 186, and to.the Department of Overseas Trade, unnumbered.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith five copies of a brief translation of a series of articles published in “ Le Journal de Teheran ” in its issues from 30th f* September to 14th October under the heading of “ Les Mines de ITran ”. 2. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary to the Oovernment of India in the External Affairs Department at New Delhi under No. C. 8, and the Commercial Secretary, British Embassy at Baghdad under No. C-12, of today. Enclosure to Serial No. (86). Brief recapitulation of articles published in “ Le Journal de Teheran ” from 30th September to 14th October 1937 on “ Les Mines de VIran From information obtained from geological and mineralogical studies and prospecting it may be affirmed that Iran disposes of mines comprising ores, coal, salt, sulphur, granite, oil, mineral waters, etc. 1. Gold .—Gold is found in Iran in three forms. (a) pure in alluvial ground and in sediment of certain rivers. (b) pure in flint (c) mixed in pyrites. AH the gold at the Kouh-Zard (yellow mountain) south of Danghan has been extracted, only some alluvial quartz remaining. The Anarak mines have recently furnished a few small lumps of pure gold. Other mines exist at Bourujird, Hamadan, Firuz Kuh, between Nishapur and Meshed, and at Zarchouran, west of Zandjan. It has been found that the exploitation of the above-mentioned mines would not be profitable, but it is hoped to find gold more plentifully mixed with other metals such as copper and lead. 2. Silver .—No silver mines have as yet been found but it is hoped to find the metal in ores containing lead, copper and nickel, 3. Lead. —It is reported that the existence of more than 50 lead mines have been located. Most of the mines already exploited proved to be of carbonate of lead : in others sulphur was present. The principal mines are at Khorasan, Kashan, Hamadan, Kerman, Nain, Anarak, Pass-ghaleh near Tehran, Damghan, Khamseh and in Gharahdagh in Azarbaijan, The latter deposits include sulphur, pyrite, zinc, with a small quantity of gold and silver. 4. Zinc .—No zinc mine has been found but zinc is found mixed with other deposits at Gharadagh, Passghaleh, Anarak, south of Tezd and in Khorassan. 5 fin —No tin mines located yet but there are expectations of finding some in the regions of Kouh Biyan and in the mountains to the west of Resht. 6. Copper .—Copper is found principally in the Gharadagh, the mountainous regions in the south, Zaveh, Zandjan, Mianeh, Djandagh, in the Alberz, in Kho rassan between Meshed and Nishapour, Abbassabad, Sabzevar, Kerman, Yezd, Nain, Anarak, Isfahan and Kashan. 7. Mercury .—No prospecting has been made as yet, but it is possible that mercury may be found in the mountains of Nain Ghaleh Afshar. 8. Arsenic .—Granite lumps including arsenic and sulphur have been found in the mountains of Kurdistan, the Ghaflan Kuh (south east of Tabriz) and in the region of Anarak mixed with copper and nickel. 9. Nickel and Azure Cobalt .—Both are found at Anarak, and traces exist in the mountains north of Tehran. Cobalt is found also in the regions south west of Kashan where it exists in iron ore. Exploitation of the deposits at Anarak has shown a good percentage of nickel in the ores extracted. Studies lead to the presumption that nickel exists in other regions of Iran. 10. Chrome. —Chrome in the form of chromate is found in Khorassan and at Sabzehvar. The percentage of chrome is 28%. It has also been found that lumps of serpentine generally contain chrome. It is expected to find the mineral in the mountains of Takhteh Suleiman and to the west of the Chalous Road.105 11. Antimony. —Found in the form of sulphate or oxide of antimony to the west and south of Anarak. There are expectations from the surroundings of the Benan Mountain. 12. Manganese. —Manganese has been found at Meskarabad, a village near lehran, at Robat Kerim, at Anarak, in the mountains to the south of Yezd and close to the Sahand Mountain. 13. Iron. —More than 40 iron mines have been discovered and many others will probably be located. The mines at Bafagh and Narikan, north of Nain, have given the best results. Other mines are near Semnan, Damghan, Kashan, Ardshe, Meskarabad : iron deposits exist at Chalous, Noe-Shahr, in the mountains of Takhteh-Suleiman, at Anarak, at Kouheh Banan and in other regions. There are, moreover, large reserves of iron in the clayey soil and ash deposits in Mazanderan where the fer ruginous nature of the ground stretches from the south of Amol to the Caspian Shore. It may be stated with certitude that Iran has a great reserve of iron. In addition there are the red oxide mines at Hormuz. 14. Asbestos. —Asbestos is found in the neighbourhood of Meshed, Kouhe, Banon (near Tehran), Kashan, Anarak and the mountains of Golpayeean. I he Department of Mines has recently been giving much attention to samples of asbestos, of which some have been sent to Europe for analysis and assay. Should these give satisfaction to manufacturers of asbestos, this mineral branch will take a preponderant place in exports from Iran. 15. ' Term r{fraclaire.—{Y\vQ Clay). The presence of this, and of Terre de Chine, is certain in many regions of Iran. The mines between Tehran and Qum are very good as are also the mines at Ghamabad. Other mines are in Mazanderan, Khorassan, at Shiraz and Anarak. A summary of studies up to date shows the following results : In Iran are found all the metals found in other parts of the world. Platinum, one of the rarest metals which one did not expect to find in Iran, exists in the nickel deposits at Anarak. Studies made in the matter, particularly at the mines of Kaval show that lumps of nickel weighing a ton contain four grammes of platinum. Other expensive metals are found in several regions of Iran, the richest area being at Anarak, 30 Kilometres north east of Nain, but unfortunately this is some- what far from important centres : this drawback will, however, be remedied. B.ock Salt. Is available practically all over the country, and other salt on the shores of Lake Eezaieh (Urmia) and in the Persian Gulf. There is little information about Sets de potasse in Iran. Thick layers of plaster exist near Aran in the region of Mamane, 35 Kilometres to the north east of Mianeh : a second layer is above the first layers and a third layer of a reddish colour covers the two layers. This third layer is composed of potash and chloride of hydrated magnesia. Alum. Is found at Zandjan, also near Deh Rouzdar between Alamut and Mendjil, near Talesh and near Kazvin. Borax.—Mich deposits have been found at Babak near Dehparise, and the marshes in that region are being exploited for soda and calcium also. Oilier deposits are foreseen in the mountains near Sabzehvar and in the neighbourhood of Lake Rezaieh. Nitre .—No natural deposits. Sulphur.—Is found in the gassous state, or sedimentary in springs of mineral waters. The first sort is in volcanic craters, i.e., the top of Demavand and Kouhe Taftane (55 miles South of Zahedan) in Mekran. The second sort is found south of Semnan, west of Bandar Abbas, on the Islands of Hormuz and Qishm, near Bush ire, at Takhte Suleiman and in the mountains of Kurdistan. Turquoise have been extracted from the mine at Nishapour for very many years. Rubies are found in the neighbourhood of Meshed. Plaster y which is abundant, has been extensively used in connexion with rail way construction. Local travertin has been used for the railway station at Tehran. Marble is found at Tourane in Khorassan. Aragonite of good colour and re sembling marble is mined near Yezd. EC184EADCoal. —Prospecting and study show that rich seams of coal exist along the Elburz Range from the Caspian sea to Meshed and on towards the Afghan frontier Coal annears to be plentiful in the Shemshak mountains north of Tehran and at Zirab E the coalTs of the best quality found n Iran By-products are coke, tar, benzol, ammoniac, combustion gas and special coal for electrical p a (No mention is made of the mines at Abyouneh and Pimeh, respectively 65 and 90 miles north of Isfahan ; at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam in Khorassan near the fghan frontier, and exploitation in Azarbaijan.) Then follows a column on mineral oil in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Amiranian Oil Company are mentioned, and ending with a statement that besides these two enterprises there is still a large field in Iran for the extension ot this industry. . Mineral Waters.—The following springs are under exploitation : Kamsar, Ardabil. Abi Ali (on the way to Demavand), the thermal waters ot Demavand, the hot springs between Kazvin and Hamadan and others of minor importance. Exploitation of the following mines has been accorded for specified periods by the Ministry of Finance, in the districts of : Eastern Azarbaijan.—Salt, lead, sulphur, orpiment, coal, lime, Western Azarbaijan. —Salt. Isfahan. —Salt, millstones, coal. Bushire. —Salt. Bandar 466ns.—Salt, sulphur, alum. Lurestan and Burujird. —Salt, coal. Khorrasan. —Lead, salt, turquoise, coal, millstones, Khamseh. —Salt, alum.

Qum .—Salt, The following mines are exploited directly by the Ministry of Industries and Mines Iron .— Prospecting and the exploitation of iron at Semnan is in train, Similar activity is shewn at Meskarabad, at Doshan Tappeh (both near Tehran), at Araheh and Salahedin Kolia. Experts have been sent to the mines at Bafgh (South East of Yezd) and Bavikan where good results are expected. An installation for smelting, to produce 300 tons of “ fer brut ”, has been ordered (presumably for Aminabad where the first stone was laid by His Imperial Majesty the Shah on 14th October). The Anarak Mines .—The programme of the administration of the Mines with regard to Anarak is principally to discover mines which can be exploited, secondly the exploitation of mineral ores containing copper and nickel and the creation of two furnaces for smelting copper with a daily output of 8 tons of raw copper to be refined subsequently. The ore treated by the furnaces actually gives 70% of copper. This copper is then sent to the installation at Ghani Abad (close to Aminabad) where it will be refined and electrolysed. A contract has been made with Ferrostahl for the completion and perfection of the work of exploitation at Anarak. In accordance with this contract the German Company has to extract 1,000 tons of nickel and 4,000 tons of copper within a maximum delay of two years and this material has to be exported. The proceeds107 realised, on the base of international prices, will assure the expenses of the exploi tation and purchase of new machinery for an increased output : the surplus after deduction of the expenses mentioned will be paid to the Treasury on account of the Government. In conclusion it is stated that up to the present only the region of Anarak has been the subject of study and exploitation as indicated above, and these activities continue. Recently important nickel mines have been found at Noval, Koud, Korad and Tehareh Choureh, and it would not be surprising if other mines of capital importance were found in this region. Studies in the last two years have shown the necessity of engineers and technicians qualified for the exploitation. In order to meet the situation the collaboration of foreign engineers was sought and later technical schools for arts and handicraft have been established, the “ Ecole des Arts-et-Motiers ” at Anarak having given good results. Much remains to be done but the Government’s programme is expected to bring about excellent results in this branch of industry which is of particular interest to increase the prosperity of the country by bringing to light its sub terranean reserves. Tehran ; F. A. G. GRAY, The 16th October 1937, (87) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 410-E., dated 3rd November 1937. I have the honour to report two interesting measures recently taken with a view to strengthen the position of the Banque Mellie, Iran. The first was published in the “ Etaleat ” of 26th October, and this was an announcement to the effect that His Imperial Majesty the Shah had handed over all his hoardings of gold to the Bank : the value was not mentioned nor is it clear whether an actual gift, or merely a deposit was made. 2. The press at any rate applaud the royal gesture, which should serve as an example to all patriotic Iranians who are invited to sell their gold to the bank and thus assist the national economy and prove their love of the fatherland. In view of the fact that there would appear to be a growing tendency to purchase land, not only in Tehran but in certain provinces also, rather than to retain rials, it remains' to be seen if the lucky holders of gold will prove to be patriotic enough to exchange it for bank notes. 3. The second measure was a bill, signed by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, submitted to Parliament on the 28th October with a view to the sale of part of the Crown jewels ; a copy of the text of the preamble and the bill, published in the “ Journal de Teheran ” of the 31st October, is furnished herewith. 4. If these measures were taken with the hope of inspiring more confidence in the stability of the country's finance it is possible, and probable, that quite a contrary effect will be the result. 5. It is impossible to obtain reliable figures of the advances made to the Gov ernment by the Banque Mellie, Iran, but from the last published balance sheet of the bank, giving the position at 7th October last, the following items are shewn as assets : Rials. “ Administrations Puhliques ” ., ,. .. •• 695,390,570’80 “ Fonde d’Etat et Actions ” .. .. .. •• 106,826,020’00 making a total of .. .. •. • • • • 802,216,590 - 80 or, at 80 rials to the £ about £10,027,770. On the Liabilities side “ Administrations Publiques ” show a figure of rials 364,505,027—or about £4,556,300. In the absence of any official figures of the Government’s debt to the bank, it may be inferred that the difference between the figures quoted above, that is to say £5,471,470, may roughly be taken to represent the Government’s indebtedness to the State Bank ; its commitments with the Agri cultural Bank are not known.2. At the same time there has been a considerable increase in the amount of goods cleared from the Customs, and the position in this respect has improved ap preciably. Imports received at the Customs have also increased. This is attri buted not to an increase of total imports into Iran, but to the fact that ships are now avoiding Bandar Shahpur owing to the very bad conditions prevailing there. Work on the new Customs buildings and warehouses at Khorramshahr, which was stopped some time ago when it was rumoured that the Khorramshahr Customs were to be made subordinate to those at Bandar Shahpur, has now begun again. 3. River transport on the Karun is hoav reported to be almost entirely in the hands of the Sherkat Kashtinani Karun, which is working this part of its business also with success. It has however no monopoly of river navigation, as opposed to transport from ship to shore at Khorramshahr. As far as I am aware, Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company are still operating the tug “ Shirin ” for the Iran Transport Company. They have been given, permission to tow two barges abreast until the 22nd December next. After that date they must comply with the new regulations limiting the total width of tugs and barges together to 14 metres. 4. Captain Stewart reports that there has been a noticeable improvement in the attitude of the naval authorities at Khorramshahr in recent months. At the beginning of the year Colonel Bayendor and his brother Major Bayendor, the Port Officer, repeatedly interferred in shipping matters to the inconvenience of shipping firms, and it is satisfactory that they are now showing themselves more helpful. Interference in minor matters however continues, and recently shipping agents were ordered to employ only Iranian coolies instead of the Iraqi coolies formerly employed. Captain Stewart adds that the local authorities, and in particular the Naval Authorities, have recently shown a much more helpful attitude towards His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate. 5. With regard to the congestion now existing at Bandar Shahpur, I am in formed that the Iranian Government have recently signed a contract with “ Sofitee ” the Swiss constructional firm backed by Messrs. Julius Berger, which obtained the contract for the Tehran Railway Station, for improvements at Bandar Shahpur at a cost of Rials 12,500,000 (£156,250). The improvements are said to include a second berth to the existing jetty, which is to be reinforced by metal construction. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagh dad No. 76 and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz No. 46.

Enclosure V to Serial No. (90). Telegram from Mr. Butler (Tehran), No. 19-Saving, dated 2 nd November 1937. My telegram No. 140. Hunng the summer the London Board recommended Tehran Manager to lodge protest. He deprecated this after discussion with His Majesty’s Minister preferring to try to negotiate a compromise. This he has in outline with the help of the Minister oi .1 ustice. London Board have sanction ed this compromise in last resort but wish him first to consult His Majesty's Minister with a view to protest. 2. Tehran Manager tells me that regulations will undoubtedly involve more labour and expense and are likely to involve less accurate auditing. They are not however impossible and if proposed compromise is accepted by Iranian authorities “ compliance in full ” would be very substantially reduced. It would be confined to those officially sealed books which a bank is bound to keep and produce if neces sary in a court of law and which it is not unreasonable that a bank practising in Iran should keep in Persian language. 3. As regards protest we know of no legal ground for it; we could not maintain that compliance was impossible and the bank could only plead ground of domestic loss of efficiency. This argument is much more likely to appeal to Iranian Gov ernment if advanced by Oil Company in whose efficiency and profits they are directly interested. 4. Manager believes that protest would be unavailing and forfeiting goodwill of Iranian authorities impair his position for many months. The regulations have been sanctified by the Shah : the Prime Minister has said that no exceptions can be made, i.e., that none will be authorised in writing. In so far as registrations obtained in unwritten compromise may be (grp. omtd.) I believe His Majesty’s Minister would in the circumstances consider the best procedure that bank should rest upon their outline compromise between now and March (while Oil Company see what they can secure independently) consequently would deprecate a protest now supported by His Majesty’s Government. (91) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 447, dated 4th December 1937. I I have the honour to inform you that since the end of the summer a number of high officials in Pars, including the Governor-General and the General Officer Commanding, have been dismissed from their posts. The late Governor-General, Abul Path Dowlatshahi, is a Qajar prince who probably owed his appointment to his relationship to the second Pahlevi Queen. He is a gambler and spendthrift, and went to Shiraz in 1936 loaded with debt. During the eighteen months in Pars he did little but make money as fast as he could. In collision with the General Officer Commanding, General Zandieh, he took seven hundred rials per family from the tribes of Pars, who were then allowed to migrate as usual, while reports were sent to Tehran that they had all been settled in houses. In the month of August alone the Governor-General was said to have received, 60,000 rials from the butchers of Shiraz in return for permission to increase the price of meat. At the end of August he was hurriedly summoned to Tehran, where he is believed to have been put under arrest. The house which he occupied at Shiraz was seized by the police, but was later returned to its owner, who refused to lease it anv longer to the Governorate-General. A few weeks before N. Dowlatshahi's fall, M. Ali Asghar Soheily, brother of the Iranian Minister in London, had beendismissed from his post of Head of the Municipality of Shiraz. There seems no doubt that he had demanded and received bribes from every quarter. He left the Municipality in debt to the extent of Rials 700,000, mostly advances from the National Bank made for works which he had failed to carry out. Except for a series of demolitions, including that of the ancient Kovan Gate and of part of the magnificient bazaar of Kerim Khan Zand, there is nothing to show for his tenure of his post. In October M. Soheily was sent back to Shiraz under arrest for the investigation of various charges against him. In September three officials responsible for the administration and settlement of the Qashgai and Khamseh tribes were also dismissed and sent to Tehran. They are said to have sent reports to Tehran stating that a large number of houses had been built for the tribes. A general sent from Tehran to inspect the district found that their reports were untrue and that no account could be given of a sum of a million rials allotted for trial settlement. 2. It must be admitted that the bribery and corruption which has been ram pant in Ears is, though on an unusually large scale, no means exceptional in the Iran of today. Observers who have known this country for many years and since long before the Pahlevi regime, say that they have never known corruption to be as widespread as it now is. The growing interference of the State in every aspect or life gives local officials, and especially the Police, unlimited opportunities of graft. At the same time the salaries of Iranian officials are small, while the social changes of the recent years oblige them to adopt a far higher standard of living than was formerly required of them. Often they can have no alternative but to make an illicit income while they can. 3. A curious and interesting appointment has now been made to the Gover- norate-General in Pars. The new Governor-General is M. Muhammad Ibrahim Alam, who will be more familiar under his former title of Shaukat-ul-Mulk (Personalities in Iran No. 189). He was of course formerly hereditary Amir of Kain, and a great landlord in Seistan and the Kainat. For some time he had been closely attached to the Shah in Tehran, and like the Qawam, had been a member of his suite on recent tours. His appointment to Pars was a complete surprise to him. He had been appointed Governor-General of Kerman and had already sent all his furniture and possessions there. But when he called on the Shah to take leave, he was told to proceed immediately to Pars. When Mr. Watkinson called on him in Shiraz, Shaukat-ul-Mulk confessed that he was completely bewildered. He said he knew nothing of Pars and had never been a Governor under the present regime. He hoped that his appointment would be merely temporary. But he made no secret of his fears that his appointment was really a banishment that would lead to disgrace and ruin, in anticipation of which he had sent all his family to his properties in East Iran. It is significant that the Shaukat, who has laways been markedly pro-British and was a great friend in particular of Colonel Daly, disclaimed all knowledge of English, which he is believed formerly to have spoken fluently. He is not likely to run the risk of a charge of being pro- British in his work in Pars. Mr. Watkinson anticipates that he will be little but a figurehead, and that he will not be able to impose his will on the Police or Muni cipality or Revenue Office and still less on the local Army Command. The cir cumstances of his appointment will probably make him only too anxious to avoid being dragged into prominence in any way, and it is hardly to be hoped that he will succeed in improving or cleaning up the administration of Pars. But the experi ment of appointing to a Governorate-General a great hereditary landowner is an interesting one, and developments in Pars will be watched with interest. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. 224, and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Shiraz, No. 37, Tabriz No. 20, Ahwaz No. 61 and Kermanshah No. 36. (92) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 445, dated 4th December 1937. I have the honour to inform you that the text of a lengthy address delivered by His Excellency Hassan Vassuq, G.C.B., President of the Parhangistan, the new Academy for the revision of the Iranian language, on September 28th last, has recently been reproduced in the local press.2. The general tone of this address which sets out the aims and objects by which those who are interested in the improvement of the language should be guided is moderate and well-informed and the matter appears to be of sufficient interest to justify me in sending you the enclosed copy of a minute written by the Military Attache to His Majesty’s Legation summarising the various points made by the lecturer and adding his comments thereon, 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. 222, 1. Linguistic individualism must exist .—Quite so. Every work on comparative philology says the same. 2. Incorporation and borrowing is inevitable. —This is equally true. 3. Doubtful urisdom of recent introduction of Latin script in Turkey. —A few years ago Iranians were watching this experiment closely and many competent observers thought that Iran would soon follow suit. The recent swing back (as evinced by the new order prohibiting the use of foreign languages and scripts in shop signs and commercial institutions) has, of course, caused the lecturer to voice this doubt even if he does not feel it. 4. The universal desire of all Iranians to improve their mother tongue. —An officially inspired utterance. Those Iranians who are not learning foreign languages in the course of business or in hopes of professional promotion are proud (and justly proud) of their own tongue. 5. No change is desirable which would sever the \connection with Iranian literacy or national history. —I am glad to hear this. Had the “ back to Firdausi ” seed ling continued to sprout with its initial rapidity the resulting crop of Wardour Street Persian would have rendered an ode of Hafiz utterly unintelligible to any Iranian child of the next generation. 6. Unnecessary Arabic words should be eliminated and replaced by old Persian words and new Persian words should be made out of old Persian roots. —It is difficult to be brief in criticising this very ambitious project. Arabic is, probably, of all languages (not even excluding Greek or Latin) the one best suited for word building. Provided a verbal root exists which expresses the idea it is desired to convey, there is (in grammatical theory, though not always in usage) almost no limit to the number of derivatives which can be formed. Such is the symmetrical perfection of this Semetic language. Persian, though a very fair specimen of an inflectional i\ryan language, cannot compete. An Arabic dictionary will render “ he electrified ” by . The most modern and widely-used Persian dictionary translates the same phrase by :— However, no attempt to tell the Iranian what fun he could have had with the Arabic root will avail and, if he has decided to do without it, we must see what material he has available for his own project. His own language is luckily very rich in suffixes to express the following ideas :•— The doer, the place where something is done, the doing and the business of doing the container, source or locality of anything : abounding in : causing, producing, displaying, similar to, made of, filled with, of the colour of ete., etc. With these he will make shift. 7. The greatest harm to Persian has come, not from imported single Arabic words but from whole phrases and their subjection to Arabic grammar rules even when used in Persian. —Such phrases seem to me to ffill into two broad categories, viz :—scrip tural and lay. An example of the first category is a phrase continually on the lips of every Iranian. Though a national spirit seems to have replaced a religious spirit, though the power of the clergy has been broken and their powers transferred to the civil administration, though the average townsman is lax in his religious observances, though in brief, every effort has been made to reduce Islam in Iran to the position of a museum piece, old usages and phrases die hard and it is very unlikely that any legislation will replace by An example of the second category is :— (on this supposition) one of those unnecessary foreign importations used to “ shew off ” by the would be erudite. As regards these (of which there are many) I am in hearty agreement with the lecturer. (In this field A. P. H. would find ample scope.)8 One should try to recapture the dignity and simplicity of the period from the 4th to the 7th centuries of the Negira and reject such A rabic words which came later.~- In trying to recapture some ot the simplicity and dignity of, for example, the “ Shahnameh ” one can only hope the Iranian wont recapture its capacity to borne. The euphuistic, florid, bombastic style of Persian has a comparatively short existence (part of the 16th and 17th centuries under the Timunds) and simplicity and sweetness of diction has always been one of the chief chaims to the student of Persian. 9. In the absence of any correct Persian equivalent for a scientfiic term, such a term Urwmnvrl rh'rvrt frnm. thp fnrp.inn l/inaimue in which it is current .—This almost amounts to an aphorism, it is jusr wnar rney nave always uune, e.&lt;/., (telegraph) from which, naturally, we get (a telegraphist) in the above examples Arabic sind Turkish suffixes and inflections have been used,1 EXTERNAL AFFAIRS BE PA I FILE No. 7-N. of 1938, SERIAL Nos. 1—83 Iran Series for 1938, IRAN SERIES FOR 1938. d) Copies to India No. 223. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 446 (491/19/37), dated the 4th December 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 380 of the 8th October, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of an interesting despatch which has just been received from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz regarding the recent rising of the Bahmai tribe of the Kuhgilu. A summary of the leaflet forwarded by Mr. Gardener is also enclosed. 2. Since Mr. Gardener’s report was written the situation has not changed appreciably. Early in November His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz reported that the Behbehan and Ardakhan, both of which were said to have been attack ed were then reported by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to be quiet. The military authorities had ceased by that date to commandeer civil transport in Shiraz. On the 20th November, Mr. Gardener telegraphed that there were no developments to report, and that the tribesmen were still quietly besieged. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department No. 223. Notice to all villagers and inhabitants of the Bahmai tribe. As is generally known, Khoda Karam of Bahmai has gathered together a number of villagers and committed an outrage against the military forces at Qaleh Ala (though few in number, those forces behaved with great courage and were able to defend themselves). Therefore Khoda Karam will shortly be pursued, severely punished and the cause of trouble will be removed. The Government had no intention of taking any action against the Khoda Karam and people like him, but Khoda Karam abused their lenient attitude and so made it necessary for the Government to gather their forces against him to show their authority. Khoda Karam has shown himself to be a rebel and any persons who asso ciate themselves with him will also be considered rebels. If, on the other hand, they surrender their arms, they will be granted full security and allowed to continue their occupations as hitherto. They should be careful not to be deceived by Khoda Karam and should take the opportunity of this offer to separate themselves immediately from him and surrender their arms as soon as they encounter the soldiers who are pursuing them. They should also be careful not to sacrifice themselves for Khoda Karam’s cause, for they must know that every villager has got to submit to the Government’s authority, otherwise he will bring punishment on him selfand will regret it ever after wards. Confidential i-etter from British Consulate, Ahwaz, to the Foreign Office, No. 87, dated the 15th October 1937. As reported in the correspondence ending with my letter No. 22/12/104 of 10th June last, the Iranian Government having decided to disarm and bring under control the Bahmai tribe of the Kuhgilu, a military force of some 600 men was despatched from Ahwaz and based on Behbahan. There they were placed under Sarhang Saqafi, the Military Governor of Behbehan. There is no information as to whether other troops were sent from the Shiraz or other commands. 17(S) EAD. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA PROCLAMATION. .ETTER CEIVED 8 .5 - - 9*-19392 2. The information detailed below is believed to be correct but owing to the great difficulty of getting reliable information, no guarantee of accuracy can be given. 3. The plan of campaign seems to have been to exercise such pressure on the tribe as to secure the submission of their leader Khoda Karam, who had been declared an outlaw, the surrender of arms and ammunition and the general pacification of the tribesmen without bloodshed. 4. True to their traditional strategy, the tribes withdrew from the south in a north-westerly direction towards their fortress called Qaleh Ala and a nearby mountain named Koh-i-Mungasht. These two are situated about six miles apart in a district about forty miles to the east of Ram Hormuz and Haft Khel. In their retreat, the tribesmen were followed by the military detachment but no engagement took place. Instead a nephew of Khoda Karam with some fifty followers surrendered to the military and were enrolled as irregulars and armed. 5. When Qaleh Ala was reached, it was found to be unoccupied by the Bahmai and Sarhang Saqafi ordered its demolition. This was a blunder as it seemed obvious that the Bahmai would congregate on Kuh-i-Mungasht, roughly six miles to the east in which event it would have been useful as a centre for the Iranian military. At this point Khoda Karam became des pondent and sought to make terms. He sent his wife and children to the troops offering the submission of his tribe, the surrender of all arms and obedience to all Government orders in the matter of subscription, payment of revenue etc. In return he asked to be allowed to remain free to live in the mountains, promising to be peaceful. This offer was communicated to Ahwaz by the Officer-in-Charge of the garrison, Sultan Qahremani, but the command headquarters, possible after reference to Tehran, refused these terms and ordered the arrest of Khoda Karam by force if necessary. His wife and children, who had been well treated by the military were then allowed to go back to Khoda Karam. 6. Determined to resist, Khoda Karam organised an attack on the military which began at 3 a.m. on the night of the 19th September and lasted for about 48 hours. In this he was apparently aided by the Bahmai who had been enrolled as irregulars. The attack which started at first as a hand to hand struggle was partly successful, the Military Governor of Behbehan being killed while some four other officers and about sixty other ranks were killed or wounded. In addition, rifles ammunition and one machine gun were cap tured and Sultan Qahremani and a few other ranks were taken prisoners. These prisoners subsequently escaped in a later skirmish though they were well treated when in captivity. The losses sustained by the tribesmen do not appear to have been serious owing to the successful use of surprise. The military machine gunners seem to have caused most casualties. The tribes men s plan was to surround the military and exterminate them but the tribes- men were ignorant of the powers of the machine gun and so the plan failed« The military remained and the tribesmen withdrew to Mungasht. Actually the Iianian military were greatly outnumbered and seem to have fought welh 7. This partial reverse suffered by the Iranian arms made a profound impression on the military. General Muiny returned by air from Tehran,, although according to local report he was doing the course for general officers organised by the French Military Mission. Arrangements were made to send m roop-j Irom Ivhorramabad and Dizful (girrisons in the Khuzistan commanc) and from Shiraz the. plan being to concentrate on Kuh-i- Mungasht from various directions and to beleaguer it. General Muiny withdrew the cavalry and mountain gun sections of the original force- declaring them to be unsuitable for the terrain. It is said that the total mi i ary s length now employed in the area now amounts to some eight thousand men though no reliance can be placed on this figure. To get the . ^ az J^to portion lorries and ta,xi cabs were commandeered for several A f ? urther stated that four light tanks have been sent to the area. in eres mg re-infoi cement was the despatch of about sixty young officers, who were undergoing training in Tehran. ^ ^ J 6* 4 t 3 8. As already stated, the plan of the Bahmai to surround the military and exterminate them having failed they fled to the Kuh-i-Mungasht. Plere the military were unable to follow them owing to the disorganisation of battle, the smallness of the available force and extreme difficulties of the terrain. 9. Nevertheless while reinforcements were being brought in, the air arm was employed. For some days the eight aeroplanes stationed in Ahwaz went daily to Kuh-i-Mungasht and bombed the tribesmen, causing some casual ties. No result of military value, except that of pinning down the enemy to the mountains could however be expected and after a few days aerial bombing was abandoned. The planes were used in other directions—leaflets of which I enclose the only original I have been able to procure, were dropped from the air. As few if any of the tribesmen can read, such propaganda would seem rather useless, as will be observed the leaflets urge the ordinary tribesmen to surrender and state that the only quarrel is with Khoda Karam. Aeroplanes were also used to convey General Muiny each day to the area and back to Ahwaz. Finally an emergency aerodrome seems to have been prepared near the scene of operations and two aeroplanes kept there for reconnaissance flights and for bearing messages to Ahwaz. 10. Up to the present, no attempt has been made to attack the tribes men on the mountain. Apparently this is a large broken mass of ground, very difficult to take by assault. On the other hand, the tribesmen can subsist there on such cattle and sheep as they have, together with vegetable products for a considerable period. From what I can gather locally the present idea is not to storm the mountain, but to surround the mountain and rely on the winter cold and storms to cause the rebels to lose heart and desert their leader. 11. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to the Honourable the Politi cal Resident, Bushire (No. 1385), His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz (No. 1386), and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr (No. 1387). P. S. —The estimates of the number of tribesmen engaged in the conflict vary widely. It seems probable, however, that the correct number is in the region of tw'o thousand of whom less than one thousand have rifles.

With reference to my despatch No. 118 of the 18th March last, I have the honour to inform you that the recent visit of Herr Baldur von Shirach to Tehran has given rise to renewed complaints in the Soviet press that fascist doctrines are making dangerous headway in Iran. The accompanying article from the “ Journal de Moscou ” of the 14th December is on similar lines to others which have appeared during the last few weeks in the Soviet verna cular press. The writer, it will be seen, concludes from the manner in which Herr von Shirach was received that German influence has taken deep root in Persia. Although the leader of the German Youth movement has no official position in the German Government, he was accorded by the Iranian autho rities a ceremonial welcome far exceeding what is customary in visits to one government by the representatives of another, and was allowed to review the fascist forces in the Iranian capital as though he were at Nuremberg or Munich. As for the Iranian officials in charge of the review, their conduct was sadly reminiscent of the semi-colonial Qajar regime. The “ Journal de Moscou ” concludes with the hope, not very confidently expressed, that some Iranian statesmen are to be found who look with disapproval on the efforts of4 international fascism to include their country in the orbit of German and Italian colonial aspirations ; and that Iranian public opinion will refuse to be inveigled into the adoption of so inglorious a role. 2. From the Iranian Embassy here, I understand that the enormous Per sian colony in the Caucasus has suffered greatly in the anti-Trotskist purge notwithstanding the very humble circumstances of most of its members, and that the Embassy has in fact renounced all hope of affording its nationals adequate protection.

With reference to my despatch No. 271-E. of 17th July last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a decree regarding insur ance companies approved by the Council of Ministers on 18th October last, which has been furnished by Messrs. Fowler and Company Limited, Tehran. This decree cancels the decree of 11th Mehr 1315 (3rd October 1936) which was reported in my despatch No. 465-E. of 15th October 1936. The transla tion may not be entirely reliable, but I have thought it well to forward it to you without delay. I will not fail to inform you of any corrections which may be found necessary when the official text of the Regulations is published. 2. Mr. de Courcy, the Baghdad director of Messrs. Fowler and Company Limited was in Tehran till a few days. Just before leaving for Baghdad he said that he was aware of the gist of the new regulations which were being examined by the Council of Ministers, and that he was of the opinion that the new conditions would be acceptable to foreign insurance companies. 3. Mr. Mizrahi, the Manager of Messrs. Fowler’s office in Tehran, who furnished the translation of the new regulations, called on me today and told me that the Iran Insurance Company had convened a meeting on 3rd Noveim her of all insurance institutions, which comprised the following concerns ; Iran Insurance Company. Fowler and Company Limited. Ezra M. Hakkak and Sons (Alliance Assurance). Alianz Stuttgarter. Gosstrach (Soviet Assurance Company). Palestine Lloyd. Royal Insurance (represented by Mr. Howarth of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company). 4. In general the conditions of the regulations appear to be reasonable* The only serious difficulty would appear to be the formation of a “ syndicate ”. Mr. Mizrahi said that a commission of five had been nominated “to fix Insurance rates and discuss general conditions of the policies in respect of Fire, Transport and Motor insurance ”. The representatives of the Iran, Fowlers, Gosstrach, Alianz Stuttgarter and Palestine Lloyd were nominated. Mr. Mizrahi, not understanding French, was unwittingly included, but’on learn ing later that he had been appointed wrote and excused himself on the plea that his chief had left for Baghdad and he was too busy. The real reason for the refusal is that Messrs. Fowler’s principals are members of the Fire Office Committee (Foreign) and so are tied down to rates and conditions fixed by the Committee, and Mr. Mizrahi considered that Messrs. Fowler’s representative could not properly take part in a Commission to fix rates and possibly change general conditions of policies. 5. Mr. Mizrahi is naturally informing his principals at Baghdad of the situation ; the regulations have not yet been published and a proems-verbal of yesterday’s meeting is not yet available.

In accordance with the proposal No. 23389 of 26-7-16 (18-10-37) submitted by the Ministry of Commerce, and in view of the authori ties granted under Article 8 of the Companies Registration Law and Article 10 of the Supplementary Budget Law of 1314, the following decree was approved by the Council of Ministers at the meeting held on 18-10-37.

Insurance Companies can deposit cash or valuable documents instead of guarantee. If the guarantee is given for a certain period it must be renewed before its date of expiry.

Transfer of the balance of the premiums to abroad is free in accordance with the regulations. So long as the transfer of money to abroad is subject to the Exchange Regulations, if the Insurance Companies operating in Iran sustain heavy losses, the Ministry of Commerce can, exceptionally, allow payment of the amounts of loss out of the 50 per cent, mentioned above.■■■KaKX 1 Article 4. —The following insurance transactions, directly or indirectly, are prohibited, except through the firms who are registered in Iran.

[Enclosure in Weekly Letter No. 48, dated the 2nd December 1937, from Secretary, Political and Secret Department, India Office.] (E. 6604/212/34). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 586/4/37, dated the 21 st October 1937. In his letter to you No. 586/2/37 of the 9th October, about the sale of foreign aircraft in Iran, the Minister wrote that nothing had been heard here of the purchase of any Italian aeroplanes. Since that was written, the Military Attache had heard various things which bear out the Air Ministry’s report of an Italian drive in the sale of aircraft in this country. 2. First, the French Military Attache told Pybus that the Afghan Government had placed an order with Italy for 28 Savoia Marchetti bombers. 100,000 lire, or a quarter of the price, was to be paid in cash for each machine. The balance was to be paid in kind—chiefly cotton. Delivery would take place within one year. Was it not possible, he asked, that as her three friends Afghanistan, Iraq and Turkey had all been buying Italian machines, Iran might follow suit ? 3. This suggestion received some substantiation when a few days later Pybus heard from the Turkish Military Attache that the Italians had offered aeroplanes (the thought Savoia Marchetti Bombers) to the Iranians more cheaply than any other country could supply machines of a similar perfor mance. The Turkish Military Attache had asked the Italian Naval Attache whether this was so, and the latter had admitted the truth of the report. The Italians had told the Iranians that these machines, unlike British products* had been specially designed and constructed for countries like Iran where rough landing grounds made extra strong undercarriages necessary and where the great distances between landing grounds required extra petrol to be carried. The Turkish Military Attache cited these two “ specialities ” as evidence of Italian artfulness. What undercarriages were heavier or stronger than those normally fitted to British aircraft ? Again, he said, any fool could add an outsize petrol tank. 4. If the Iranian Government get an offer of aeroplanes with only a quar ter of the price payable in cash, as the Afghans are alleged to have, they can hardly fail to find this an attractive proposition. 5.

British Legation, Tehran. 16th December, 1937. Circular Despatch No. 38 (581126137). Sir, , fo inform you that I have received a number of enquiries relative o e application to British firms of the recent Iranian Regulations regardingcorres- the exclusive use of Persian in all business and official accounts and pondence. A transition of these Regulations were enclosed m my circular despatch No. 29 (S. No. (73) in F. 9-N./37] of the 26th beptember. It seems probable that similar enquiries may be addressed to you, and I have therefore thought it well to give you such guidance as I can in answering them. • 2. It should first be observed that there is nothing in the Regulations ■exempting foreign firms from their provisions, and it is certain that the Iranian Government would reply to any direct enquiries on this point that foreign firms, and even foreign concessionary companies, must observe the Regufa- tions. I do not know of any legal grounds on which the right of the Iranian Government to irooose the observance of these Regulations on foreign firms could be contested, and I consider that any enquirers should be informed accordingly. 3. At the same time it is likely to be difficult for the Iranian Government, for a time at any rate, to enforce full compliance with the Regulations. vided that all correspondence with local officials is in Persian or accompanied by a signed Persian translation and that returns such as income-tax retims are submitted in Persian, it is possible that nothing more will be demanded. In the case of internal accounts, enforcement will probably be difficult unless the books are inspected by Government officials or have to be produced in Court How probable it is that this will occur wih naturally depend on the circumstances of each particular firm, and it is impossible to give any advice applicable to all cases. I understandAhat at least one foreign firm engaged on the construction of the railway proposes to take no action to comply with the law in the keeping of its internal accounts. But this firm has an arrange ment for the payment of a lump sum as income-tax, and its books are therefore not likely to be inspected. Nor is it likely to remain long in Iran. If the fin^s to be imposed under Article 5 of the Regulations are hea\y, the Iianian Government may event rally create posts of inspectors to examine internal accounts and correspondence. But it is likely to be some time before this is done, and it will probably be safe for British firms to watch developments at first provided care is token to avoid drawing any attention to the fact that the Regulations are not being fully observed. Enquirers should, however, be warned that if they decide to adopt this course, they will incur a risk of punish ment for failure to comply with the Regulations. 4 The recoir mendntion that letters addressed to local officials should be accompanied by signed Persian translations is not intended to apply to letters from His Majesty’s Consulates. When addressing to local officials letters in English and Persian, you should continue to sign the English version only. ^ _ ( 8 ) (Received on 23rd January 1938, with Political Secretary's letter No. 1, dated the 6th January 1938.)

While regretting the departure of Sir Hugh Barnes from a post which he has filled with such distinction for so many years, the Secretary of State is confident that under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry McMahon the direction of the Bank’s affairs will be conducted in the same public-spirited manner as in the past. 3.

In this letter I referred to the case of Mr. Gahan of Cable and Wireless, which formed the subject of the correspondence ending with your despatch No. 33 of the 19th April. 2. I have now received a reply from the Foreign Office saying that they cannot allow rials to be taken -over from British Government servants for official purposes in exchange for official bills, but that they can allow the Legation and Consulate staffs to take over rials for their personal use. The gist of their reply is embodied in my circular despatch No. 37 of the 4th Decern ber. With regard to Mr. Gahan, the Foreign Office agree that he may be treated as a Government servant in view of his former service with the Indo- European Telegraph Department. They suggest that the rials which he has m Iran should be taken over from him by the members of the staff of the Resi dency , in return for rupees in India. It does not look as if we are likely to get any more exchange out of the Commission for him for a long time and it would certainly save much trouble if you could arrange for his rials to be taken over by members of your staff Will you let me know whether this has been possible ? If not, we shall have to hammer awaj- at the Commission. 3. lam sending a copy of this letter to Parsons.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a Law which passed the Majlis on the 7th November last, setting forth a complete reorganization of the administrative system of Iran, and a copy of an article taken from the ‘ Journal de Tehdran ’ of the 10th January, giving a version of a supplementary bill revising in an important manner the larger adminis trative units specified in Article II of the former law, and also modifying certain conditions of entry into the service of the Ministry of the Interior. The map mentioned in Article I of the first law has not yet been published. 2. The second of these measures has passed its second reading, but ha s not yet been reported as having received the royal assent. Its fourth article* as quoted by the newspaper, is not very intelligible, since the prime object of the bill is to recast Articles I and II of the previous enactment. 3. The translation of the Law of the 7th November is from the text in the Official Journal of the Ministry of Justice, which did not appear until some five weeks after its passage in the Majlis, and differed in certain respects from versions which had appeared previously. This circumstance, and the fact that it was known that large alterations were to be made, when the ink of the original act was scarcely dry, have caused me to refrain from rendering sooner a full report on this important legislation. Even now it would be unsafe to assume that the whole project is other than in an experimental stage, and that further wide changes w r ill not be made. As an instance of the confused manner in which things have proceeded, I should mention that, only tw r o days before the second bill was introduced into the Majlis, a list of appointments to four of the six ‘ Ustans ’, defined in the original act, was published. The posts filled were the North-western, Southern, North eastern and Mekran Ustans, and the recipients were the present Governors- General of Eastern Azerbaijan, Ears, and Khorassan, and the General Officer Commanding the 8th Division respectively. These appointments are pre sumably now in suspense. At the same time, more than one Consulate has reported that the local Governor or Governor-General had begun to style himself ‘ Farmandar ’ or ‘ Ustandar ’ before the first law had been finally placed on the statute book. 4. The broad effect of these measures wull be to break up the large pro' vinces, such as Khorassan and Ears, into departments corresponding more closely to units hitherto administered as small governorates, and to group together regions of lesser extent, differing not very much from the present smaller independent provinces, such as Khamech, Kazvin, Sultanabad (’Araq), under larger denominations. 5. A list of ‘ Shahristans ’ and ‘ Bakhshes ’ was published as an appendage to the Law of the 7th November, but it has not been thought worth wdiile to transmit this until the present phase of confusion has passed, and also be cause the Shahristans are indicated in the second of the enclosures with this despatch. It may be said, however, that the Shahristan in general represents a more compact, more homogeneous, and less extensive district than that hitherto ruled by the average governor who corresponded direct with the Ministry. 6. The heir of the former independent provincial governor is evidently the Farmandar, and the intention of Articles VI—XVIII of the Law of the 7th November seems to be to make him the backbone of the new administra tion. The actual handling of affairs is his, as well as the important duty of co-ordinating the work of local government departments (Article XI) ; and he has for this purpose a Shahristan Administrative Council (Article XVIII). His normal channel of communication with his Ministry is through the Ustandar (Articles XII, XIV, XVI—XVIII, and first paragraph of XIX) ; but on occasion (Article XIX, paragraph 2) he and the Ministry of the Interior will correspond direct, a point which may give rise to con fusion.&gt; Ct- 12 7. It thus appears that the really important unit of provincial govern ment is to be made smaller and more uniform. This should be a useful re form, for hitherto there have been great disparities between units directly dependent from the Ministry of Interior, as for instance between the huge province of Khorassan and the small district of Qum. The change should also eliminate the chance of confusion such as recently arose over the status of the Governor of the district of Khorramshahr-with-Abadan, who main tained that he was no longer subordinate to the Governor-General of Khuzis- tan, while the latter insisted that he was subordinate, and the central govern ment would give no clear decision one way or the other, but could only say that the Governor of Khorramshahr-with-Abadan could in some cases refer direct to Tehran. 8. Thus far considered, therefore, the reforms contain no important novelty except the administrative councils of the Shahristrn and the Bakhsh, but move in the direction of more subdivision, more uniformity, and more precision. Not the least, however,, of the failings that require attention in the present state of local government is weakness of local co-operation between the provincial representatives of the various ministries and departments, and the powerlessness or unwillingness of the governors to harmonise their activities. This defect has been brought into relief by the centralisation of the present regime. Quite trifling matters involving more than one department are referred by each representative to Tehran, with the result that the work of all departments is burdened with a congestion that the national capacity for brisk and resolute action is ill equipped to bear. Whether, on the one hand, the definition of the Farmandar’s function as “ the supreme authority over all national departments in the Shahristan ”, and the introduction of ad ministrative councils, will make headway against ingrained bureaucratic indolence and desire to shift responsibility, or, on the other hand, the con spicuous recent movement towards extreme centralisation will utilise the reduction of the standard provincial unit to impress itself still further, ex perience alone will show. The Farmandar’s duties are hedged about with such phrases as “ within the limits defined by law ”, and much will depend on the interpretation of these. However this may be, it is nevertheless some thing gained that a system has been formulated that is capable of germinat ing this much needed reform, 9. The principal innovation of the scheme is the ‘ Ustan ’ and its official, the ‘ Ustandar ’. The word, which is not in the current language, has been advertised as a revival from Sassanian times, whose idiom, as evidenced by such names as Shapour, evidently appeals to the present Shah, no doubt because it is untainted by Arab influence, and perhaps also from a spirit of historical emulation. But it is probably not unrelated to the familiar ter mination “ -istan ”. At first sight it might appear that the creation of Ustandars signified a recognition that the carving up of the old provinces into more numerous departments, somewhat—for all the Sassanian terminology— on the French model, and doubtless with the same intention, would create a degree of centralisation for which the times are not yet ripe in Iran, and that some devolution of authority was necessary. The six Ustans of the original law—and notably the Western and Northern, which were omitted from the list of appointments mentioned above in paragraph 3—were clearly at once realised to be unwieldy, and the process of subdivision was carried further in the amendment. 10. But the Ustandar is a nebulous figure. He has no fixed seat of government (Article III, Note) nor permanent office, a fact which will in convenience him in handling the numerous reports and instructions he is to receive and give, and is less likely to make for efficiency, than to encourage the short-circuiting provided for in Article XIX. His duties seem more like those of an inspector, a go-between, a consulting rather than a practising administrator. He has no council of Farmandars wherein he could align them all to his policy. He does not have the same patronage as the Farman- dar over appointments of subordinate officials (Articles VIII, IX), a matter which is usually of considerable importance in the East. It is likely that a ruler faced with the necessity of surrendering a measure of independence to13 the provinces would be less willing to do so to an Ustandar than to Farman- dars who would be too numerous, and each in command of too small an area, to become overmighty subjects, save in the unlikely event of combination. ^ As long as the present Shah retains his vitality, it will probably be policy to keep the migrant Ustandar from striking roots too deeply. 11. Nevertheless, the laws contain machinery which would enable an Ustandar of determination and ability to become an overwhelming influence in his division, particularly if this were for any reason to suit the central authority—or to be beyond its power to prevent—, and he were surrounded by colourless Farmandars. The consequences cannot be prophesied from the law, and depend upon the unpredictable use that may from time to time be made of the machine. 12. It is in this connexion that the class of person from whom the Ustan- dars and Farmandars are recruited becomes significant. Normally (Articles V, VI) they are to be regular government servants ; but provision is made (Article VI, Note) for the appointment of others. This might mean that an Ustan would be given as an appanage to a prince or a favourite, or equally as a place of rustication for those same persons. Possibly some avenue of promotion for Farmandars is needed. But mention of military governor ships, which now form an important feature of tribal and frontier districts, is altogether absent from the scheme, and no doubt one of the intentions underlying this provision is to enable a military commander to be placed in charge of an Ustan or Shahristan, should circumstances favour it, although the expression of the text “ official servants of the State ”, while it normally connotes civil servants, is susceptible of being stretched to include a military officer. 13. The sixth Ustan of the first law T , Mekran, corresponds to an existing area of military government, and differs from the other five in being smaller in extent, and in apparently containing no Shahristans, but only Bakhshes, according to the list alluded to in paragraph 5, though it is not clear from the wording whether it is or is not intended to consist of a single Shahristan, with headquarters at Zahedan, coterminous with the Ustan, and perhaps uniting the Ustandar and Farmandar in one person. The Ustandar appoint ed in the announcement already described in paragraph 3 was a military officer. In any case, its special character has now in appearance been oblite- rated in the Eighth Ustan of the amending law. 14. It will be seen that the whole scheme is bureaucratic, in sympathy with the general official invasion of commerce, industry and most departments of life. Representative government appears only in the lowest rungs of the scale (Articles VIII, IX), and then without even the fashionable pretences of election. 15. The official invasion is, indeed, carried one stage further, into agricul’ ture. Another law is in formation, closely dependent upon the present, con cerning the improvement of agriculture, and I shall shortly have the honour to address you on this subject. Meanwhile, the emphasis upon agriculture in the present enactments is obvious. 16. The Note at the end of Article II of the amending law, concerning Islands, repairs an omission of the original act. No doubt the primary in tention is completeness, but it might be wmrth remarking that, though Bah rain (which is not mentioned anywhere) could hardly be described as lying in the vicinity of a mainland department, Tamb and Abu Musa have in the past been claimed by the Iranian Government as forming part of the governor- ate of Lingah. 17. Article III of the amending, and Articles XXIV and XXV of the original law, provide for the adjustments of personnel and finance that will be required to carry through the change. I fear it is too much to hope that this will be done without a period of confusion. 18. To resume, the foregoing commentary upon the possible effects of this outwardly far-reaching legislation must obviously be quite speculative. Upon the spirit in which the administration is carried out, and above all on the interplay of personal factors, will depend whether the changes w ill really 17(S) ead.14 be far-reaching and alter the current of public life, or whether they will merely in the end serve to emphasise the sameness of things. It cannot be foretold that obvious failings, such as the lack of co-ordination of local departments, or the trespass by the army into spheres of civil authority in areas not ad mittedly under military regime, will be cured. Nevertheless, administrative geography is an impersonal thing that has a tendency towards permanence, and the bestowal of a more uniform system of administrative divisions con tains in it, if left undisturbed, the possibilities of significant development. 19. This matter will evidently have its effect upon the question of redefin ing our consular districts, which has formed the subject of the correspondence ending with my Chancery’s letter No. 181/27/37 of the 17th July last, and that of the identity of the officials with whom consular officers will in future have to deal. But until the present stage of uncertainty has passed, it is clearly premature to attempt to deal with this latter subject in any detail. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary of the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, No. 8 and to His Majesty’s consular officers in Iran, (circular) No. 3.

Article 10 .—Farmandars have, within the limits defined by law, the duties set out below ; they must carry out the duties laid upon them under the supervision and according to the instructions of the Ustandar :— (1) To further the Government’s general policy and to be diligent in improving social conditions in their district. (2) To be zealous in promoting agricultural progress and development and in compelling the local population and land-owners to carry out the agricultural programme which will be issued by the Central Agricultural Administration. (3) To be diligent in promoting economic and industrial progress in their district.

The Farmandar will recommend to the Ustandar any kind of reform which he may consider necessary for administrative effi ciency and is entitled to state his opinion of the Heads of Departments under his jurisdiction. In all cases he will report the measures he has taken to the Ustandar. ranslator’s Note .—In the Ministry of Justice text there is a , between and jA- I have not translated it as it does not make sense. There is no such , in the Majlis text and I. think its presence in this one is simply due to a misprint.Article 12. —In every Shahristan the Farmandar will notify the public of laws and regulations of general application. Ministries and independent government departments will furnish the Ustandar with a copy of the instruc tions and circulars on matters of general and fundamental importance which they issue to their subordinate offices in the Shahristans, in order that the Ustandar may in turn inform the Farmandars. Article 13. —The Farmandar will independently enforce laws and regu lations in so far as they concern his own subordinates and is held responsible for their enforcement. Also, without intervening directly in such a way as to cause disorder in their affairs he will see to it that other offices and Depart ments give full effect to laws and regulations and that no government official is exceeding the limits of his functions and authority. Article 14. —In the area under his jurisdiction he may investigate the complaints of private individuals and, if he finds that a law or a regulation has not been put into force at the right time, or that any state official in the area under his jurisdiction has exceeded his authority, may enquire into the matter. The Farmandar will report the results of his investigation to the Ustandar. Article 15. —The Police and Amnieh (Gendarmerie) authorities are bound to keep the Farmandar informed of events occurring in the district and to carry out in due course his lawful instructions. Article 16. —It is the duty of the Farmandar to make a tour of inspection of the area under his jurisdiction at least twice a year and if he finds any shortcomings in the administration he must correct them and send a report of the measures taken to the Ustandar. In addition, whenever important works such as the construction of roads, the establishment of a factory, the erection of a barrage, or important agricultural operations, are being carried out in the public interest in any part of the Shahristan, the Farmandar must make regular inspections and must ensure that the work is making progress within the limits of the regulations ; if he notices any irregularities he is bound to report them to the Department concerned and to the Ustandar. Article 17. —In case of need, after consulting the Department concerned and taking into consideration social conditions in the Shahristan the Farman dar may, within the limits prescribed by law, issue administrative regula tions on agricultural matters and such subjects as the preservation of public property and of national monuments ; Departments in the Shahristan are bound to comply with the regulations issued by the Farmandar, within the limits prescribed by law. In every case the Farmandar must at once inform the Ustandar. Article 18. —A Shahristan Administrative Council will be formed under the presidency of the Farmandar and will be composed of the Deputy Farman dar and the Heads of Departments in the Shahristan. It will be the Council’s duty to provide the means to agricultural improvement, to the prosperity and development of the Shahristan and to its public health services, and in general to assist the Farmandar in the execution of the duties with which he is charged by law. The Council will hold at least one session a month ; in addition, whenever any extraordinary events or occurrences take place in the Shahristan the Farmandar may, if he thinks fit, summon the Council; in every case he must without delay report the vote of the Council to the Ustan dar. A series of regulations specifying the Council’s duties in detail will be issued by the Ministry of the interior. Article 19. —It is invariably the duty of the Ustandar to keep the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministries and the independent Government Departments informed of those parts of the Farmandars’ reports which concern thfem. On general questions and subjects of urgent importance the Ministry of the Interior will issue instructions direct to the Farmandars and at the same time wdll keep the Ustandar informed. In the cases provided for above the Farmandars will report their actions direct to the Ministry of the Interior and at the same time keep their Ustandar informed. 171(S) EAD.18 Article 20. —All the duties which are entrusted to' Farmandars devolve in the Bakhsh under their control, to Bakhshdars. These will, in addition, be the authorities directly supervising the activities of the Dahdars and Kadkhodas, will superintend their work and report on the measures taken by them to the Farmandar. Article 21. —A Bakhsh Council will be formed in every Bakhsh out of the Bakhshdar and the Heads of the National Departments in the Bakhsh. In addition members may be elected from among the landowners and cultiva tors to whatever extent is necessary. The number to be invited from among the landowners and cultivators shall not be less than three. The duties of the Bakhsh Council are as follows :— {a) To examine the situation of all the villages in the district, the causes of their decay and the means necessary to their develop ment, and to propose the measures needed for the extension and furtherance of such development. (6) To be diligent in providing public health services and in meeting the other general needs of the villages situated in the Bakhsh. (c) To be assiduous in setting up agricultural and development com panies. (d) To give guidance and instruction in agricultural matters to the landowners and farmers of the district. (e) The other duties of the Bakhsh Council will be specified in a series of regulations which the Ministry of the Interior will draw up for the approval of the Council of Ministers. The Bakhshdar will in every case inform the Farmandar and the Central Agricultural Department of the vote of the Bakhsh Council. Article 22. —Farmandars and Bakhshdars will appoint one person from among the inhabitants of the area under their jurisdiction (sic : ? the area to be under his jurisdiction) to the post of Dehdar ; they will also appoint to the post of Kadkhoda of a village or number of villages (in accordance with Article 9) one of the permanent residents of the village concerned. Note .—The Dehdar is the representative of the government; the Kadkhoda is the repre sentative both of the Government and of the landowners. Article 23. —Other conditions for the election of Dehdars and Kadkhodas and also their duties, will be specified by the Ministry of the Interior in a series of regulations to be approved by the Council of Ministers. Article 24. —The Ministry of the Interior is authorised, from the date of the approval of this law until the end of 1316 (March 20th 1938) to place on pension any official whom it may think necessary, belonging to the Ministry or its subordinate Departments. The pension of such persons will be paid according to the usual principles and scales with due regard to the period served (whether in active employment or not). In order to secure these pensions the necessary credit will be included every year in the budget grants of the Ministry of the Interior and its subordinate departments and will be paid out by the Pensions Department. The re-entry of such persons into government service will be subject to the regulations laid down in the Civil Service law for entrance into government service. Article 25. —The Ministry of the Interior is authorised to receive as a loan from the Ministry of Finance, for the reforms in its present organisa tion which it may consider necessary, the sum of two million rials over and above its financial allotment for the year 1316 and to repay it out of the credit which it will be granted for the year 1317. Note. The Ministry of the Interior is not allowed to spend this additional grant except with the knowledge of the Ministry of Finance. Article 26. The law concerning the organisation of provinces and districts and the instructions to governors passed on the 14th Ziqadeh 1325 unar (20th December 1907) and all other laws on the same subjects that connlct with the present law are annulled.19 ( 12 ) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 28 (10/16/38), dated the 27th January 1938. With reference to my despatch No. 15 of the 15th January, I have the honour to inform you that on the 19th January, having occasion to see Mon sieur Mohsen Rais, Director-General at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on other matters, I took the opportunity at the end of the interview to speak to him about the recent press campaign against the United Kingdom. 2. I said that I admitted that provocation had been given, but the arti cles at fault were very often, if not generally, the production of gossip writers, and were also often in very obscure papers. There had been nothing in the English press comparable in violence to the articles which had been published here. It was also necessary to remember that the articles in England were published without the consent of the authorities, who had no power to stop them. Here on the other hand an article attacking a foreign state would necessarily be interpreted in many quarters as representing the views of the Government. While therefore a press reply to a press attack was under standable, it produced a very unfortunate impression if repeated and very violent attacks were made. 3. Monsieur Rais admitted that the whole affair was indeed unfortunate, but criticisms on the policy of a country were one thing and could be dealt with without ill-feeling : personal attacks and malicious articles about the Head of the State were another and produced great irritation and the present violent reaction. He agreed with me, however, in hoping that there would now be a period of calm in the press. 4. No further articles directly attacking the British press or His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have appeared during the last fortnight, and the campaign with which the year opened has apparently now ceased, or at any rate been suspended. It should, however, be mentioned that on the 25th January the Iran published an article, a translation of which subsequent ly appeared in the Journal de Teheran, criticising an article on Bahrein which appeared in the October issue of the World Petroleum Magazine of New York. The article which is headed “ Sir Abmed ibn Issa ! ? ”, ridicules the title of “ Sir ” borne by His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein, and contains several hostile references to His Majesty’s Government as “ Tyrannical elements ” and “ oppressors ” who have robbed Iran in the name of democracy, setting up in Bahrein a puppet Government and a cardboard Sheikh. It is perhaps also worth noting that the Iranian press has recently published a number of articles on the situation in Palestine, the tone of which has been distinctly pro-Arab. This is a new tendency, for the Iranian press has in recent years shown little interest in Palestine or sympathy with the Arabs. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department No. 14 and to the Honour able the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 6. ( 13 ) (Received on 6th February 1938, with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated the 20th January 1938.) (Enclosure in Weekly Letter No. 3, dated the 20th January 1938, from Secretary, Political and Secret Department, India Office.) Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 462 (363/12/37), dated the 15th December 1937. With reference to my despatch No. 304 of the 7th August, I have the honour to inform you that the Shah and the Iranian Government have once again been incensed by the publication in the French press of articles re garded as insulting to Iran.20 2. It appears that on the present occasion the trouble began with an article in the “ Paris-Soir ” about the journey of the Queen to Europe, in ^ which the writer said that the comfort in which the Queen travelled recalled the luxury of the Persian court. This provoked an article in the Ettela at ”, a translation of which appeared in the “ Journal de Teheran ” headed “ Encore la presse fran 5 aise ”, containing an attack on France virulent out of all proportion. The next day another long article appeared in the “ Journal de Teheran ” ridiculing the French for holding a Cat Show, of which an account had been given in the Paris “ Journal ”. The reader familiar with Iranian susceptibilities was not surprised to find in the last paragraph of this long article that the offence of the writer in the “ Journal ” was to make the old pun on the words “ Shah ” and “ chat ”. 3. The French Charge d’Affaires has informed me that he went to see the Minister of Foreign Affairs after the publication of these two articles. He found the Minister in a state of some excitement. M. Samii told him that the article in the “ Paris-Soir ” about the Queen’s journey was humiliating to modern Iran. His Excellency added that the Iranian Government had been on the point of selecting a new Minister for Paris, but that the articles in the French press had changed the situation. 4. M. de la Blanchetai told me that he was uncertain whether the Iranian Government would really refuse to appoint a new Minister on such grounds as these. He concluded by saying that his visit had at least had the effect of stopping the publication of a further series of attacks on France which he knew to be ready. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris. ( 14 ) India No. 19. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 39 (250/1/38), dated the 5th February 1938. In my despatch No. 17 of the 19th January, I had the honour to transmit to you a translation of a law for the reorganisation of the Iranian provincial system, passed by the Majlis on the 7th November, 1937. I now have the honour to transmit a translation of another important piece of legislation passed by the Majlis at the same time, namely a law concerning agricultural development, passed on the 16th November, 1937. This law should be read in connexion with that concerning the provincial reorganisation, since its provisions are based throughout on the new system to be introduced under the latter law. 2. The law of the 12th November imposes on land-owners the legal obligation to develop and to exploit their property fully. If they fail to do so, their land can be taken over and administered on their behalf, or else leased from them, by companies to be formed for the purpose. This pro vision is interesting and should be salutary if properly used. But given the conditions existing in this country, there is of course a danger that it may become another engine of oppression. At the same time Article 5 of the law may well provide opportunities for endless wrangling and delay before any effective action can be taken for the improvement of the estates of negligent land-owners. 3. Other useful features of the law are the provision of loans to land- owners who lack the means to develop their estates, and the preparation of comprehensive plans for public works in each district. If the law is effectively and equitably enforced, it should do much to increase the agricultural re sources of the country. But everything will depend on the efficiency of the new administrative system now to be introduced. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department and to His Majesty*s Consular Officers in Iran.21 Law 'providing for development, passed on the 25th Aban, 1316 (16th November, 1937). Article 1. —It is the duty of owners of agricultural land to develop it; in respect of religious foundations (vaqf) this duty devolves upon the administrator or his agent; in respect of “ Suls ”* properties upon the exe cutor and in respect of property belonging to persons incapable of adminis tering it upon their guardians. The object of the development described in this article is to obtain the maximum return from agriculture by means of the construction, restoration and repairing of qanats, the bringing into cultivation of uncultivated land, the maintenance of water-channels by the application of scientific agricul tural and hygienic principles, the erection or reconstruction of peasants’ houses on hygienic principles, the establishment of good roads between villages, the institution of clinics, the drying of marshy lands by drainage, and so on. Note .—Responsibility for the improvement of peasants’ houses, the sites of which belong to land-owners, rests with the owners of the premises. Article 2. —The expenditure necessary for development 'benefitting the Shahristan in general will be met by co-operation between the owners of the villages situated in each Dehistan ; the method of effecting this co-operation will be as follows :— The Bakhsh Council will, with due regard to the needs and the capacity for improvement and development of each Dehistan situated within its area, draw up a programme of road-building, public health measures, and recon ditioning and restoring the water-channels and qanats which are the common property of the Dehistan ; it will decide the period to be allowed for the exe cution of the programme, the expenditure imvolved, and the share of the expenses and the organising work needed for the execution of the plan to be borne by each landowner in the Shahristan. The said programme will be applied when the concurrence of the Farman- dar has been obtained. If the persons affected have any objections to the decisions of the Bakhsh Council they may duly submit their objections to the Bakhsh Council itself. The Bakhsh Council will examine the objections and give its decision thereon. In the event of the objector being dissatisfied with the Council’s decision he will refer to the Farmandar of the Shahristan.

Article 3. —If the deterioration of an estate be due to the owner’s lack of financial resources then, after the position of the estate and its owner has been investigated and enquiry has been made into the necessity of incurring any expenditure and into the amount required, the requisites of develop ment will be supplied in the form of a loan or by some other means in the manner specified in a set of regulations to be approved by the Council of Ministers. Article 4. —-If the deterioration is due, despite the owner’s possession of adequate financial resources, to his inability, resulting from lack of knowledge or strength, to provide the requisites of development, or if, notwithstanding the possession of the requisites of development, the decay of an estate or qanat is due to the negligence and slackness of the proprietor or of one of the joint owners of the qanat, and if the steps taken to force the owner to develop his estate or qanat are not effective, then for a period to be determined by the Bakhsh Council the estate or qanat will be managed and developed, either for the owner’s account or on lease, by companies or agricultural develop ment institutions to be formed in accordance with Article 21 of the Law concerning the Divisions of the Country and the duties of Farmandars and Bakhshdars passed on the 20th Aban, (11th November, 1937). i - e - the third of an estate which may be bequeathed for religious or other purposes. 17(S) EAD22 Article 5 .—In the cases mentioned in Article 4 the Bakhsh Council will prepare a comprehensive report in duplicate on the following subjects and will submit it to the Bakhshdar :— (a) The condition of the estate or qanat, the causes of its deterioration and the personal attributes of its owner or manager. (b) The steps necessary for the development of the estate or qanat the expenditure found after investigation to be necessary and the method of amortization to be adopted, due considera tion being given to the owner’s means.

The owner or his agent must submit to the Bakhshdar in writing, within ten days allowance being made for the legal distance, any comment on or refutation of the Bakhsh Council’s report. The Bakhshdar will send the second copy of the Bakhsh Council’s report, together wuth the reply of the owner or his agent, to the Farmandar of the Shahristan. The Farmandar will examine the Bakhsh Council’s report and the reply to it, will if he sees fit demand any explanations neces sary, and will give his decision. If the owner or owners or their agent do not accept the Farmandar’s decision they may, within ten days of its being communicated to them, allowance being made for the legal distance, protest to the Farmandar! This protest will be examined by an Appeal Committee consisting of the Farmandar himself, the Head of the Department of Justice and a representa tive of the Central Agricultural Department or, in his absence, the Head of the Finance Department. The Farmandar can, if necessary, call for the views of experts. The decision of this committee is final and will in due course be enforced. Article 6. If the owner or owners or their agent remain silent for ten days, allowance being made for the legal distance, after the duplicate of the Bakhsh Council s report has been communicated to them the other copy of the Council s report will be sent to the Farmandar, who will give his deci sion on the strength of the report alone. Likewise if within ten days after they have been notified of the Farmandar’s decision no protest from the owner or owners or their agent reaches the Farmandar, then there can be no further appeal from his decision which will become enforceable. Article 7. If, before the decision of the Farmandar or the Appeal Committee is put into force, the owner or owners or their agent carries out le repairs to the estate or qanat specified in the decision, then the orders issued by the Farmandar will cease to be operative.

Govern3. No further articles have appeared since that of the 12th January, and it is to be hoped that the storm has abated. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have made no reference to the English press since the publication of these articles. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, No. 7. English Publications Spread Poison. Our London correspondent sends us unpleasant news this week. According to him matter which is tendentious and unfriendly towards the Imperial nation of Iran is constantly appearing in British publications. Not a day passes without a book being written by some insignificant tourist or some sort of articles being published in one of the newspapers when their quiver is empty, they set about discovering what some Swedish tourist has written about Iran or what some Finnish traveller has noted down in the course of his journey. Then taking this as their basis and foundation magnify it for the purposes of comment, criticism or narrative begin their onslaught and, passing over in silence all the good points, make everything the object of criticism, address it all to us and so insult us. According to our correspondent’s report in all this nonsense which appears in the English press under various forms the subject-matter is common to all; that is to say there is but one theme and that disparagement of the sacred person of the monarch. To such an extent do they persist in this behaviour, which is contrary alike to reason and courtesy, that any man of experience and sagacity must inevitably regard it as no simple affair, no mere tourists’, no mere study of the situation of Iran, and must feel certain that their aims and objects are more profound and more discreditable than they apparently wish to admit. Otherwise what intelligible explanation is there of the behaviour of writers and tourists, who, wishing to describe the situation and condition of a country (however biassed they may be with regard to it) repeatedly make the sacred person of the monarch the target of their poisoned shafts and hold forth about the noble character and personal genious of one whom we consider glorious because of his great deeds, who is the object of the world’s admira tion and respect ? What can it mean but that these selfish and self-satisfied elements which wish to make the world a sacrifice to their greed are hostile to the growdh, development, progress and evolution of Iran and therefore attack that sensitive heart ( ) on which are centred the nation’s thoughts, its activities, its very life ? For one point, which to us is self-evident, is hidden from no one who has the least knowledge of the position and situation of Iran, namely that a life- giving movement has arisen in every walk of the nation’s life, has rescued the country from the position, which the English wushed it to occupy, of a buffer-state between India and other European countries, and has trans formed it into a nation which, dependent from every point of view r on its own will and inspiration alone, capable from every point of view of defending its own interests, will no longer serve as a shield to the imperial ambitions of any other power. Moreover the nation knows that this resurrection, this transformation of the Iran of 1919 to the Iran of 1937 is the fruit of the inspiration, the will-power and the devotion of that GREAT MAN who has restored the greatness of Iran, the splendours of the days of Darius the Great, and has expended every minute and second of his glorious life and the w 7 hole of his natural strength in pursuing this sacred ambition, this refulgent ideal. Therefore, to disparage in any way this Royal person, who serves as the inspiring force, as the dynamo of the ship of state, is to disparage the entire population of the country and to insult the whole Iranian nation. We wdio fully understand the reasons for the dissatisfaction of the English press lords (or these gentlemen of the English press) can well account for their anger and resentment. We in no way expect them to be pleased,28 as are the nations which love justice and peace, at the revival and transforma tion of Iran, for they wish the world and especially the Eastern countrier to be weak and impotent, in order that there may be no obstacle to their domination and supremacy ; and it is not only of Iran that they think in this way. Since the day that it became clear that the strength of Italy by sea and air had taken from Great Britain her absolute supremacy in the Mediterranean, wrathful anxiety has possessed the whole of England. Certainly in England, as in every other country, are to be found both good and bad qualities and we do not wish to enter into discussion on this point. But there is one quality which in our opinion is one of the most prominent qualities of the English by which the entire civilized world re cognises them and that is egoism and self-satisfaction developed to an extreme and insane degree. This quality is the source of many other characteristics for which the English are notorious ; it is indeed stamped on the pages of their history during the last two or three centuries and is especially prominent in the gloomy history of the colonies belonging to them. From time to time the behaviour and policy of the English in their colonies has come to the notice of learned writers and just men, lovers of justice, and they have been stricken with consternation and amazement that such ruthlessness and lack of mercy could be found in human beings in human beings moreover who claim a place in the community of civilised nations. But it is not surprising that the English allow to the inhabitants of their colonies no right of life or tranquillity and engage in every sort of tyranny and oppression as a matter of course, because in them egoism has so completely overcome the forces of reason and morality that, aware of no one but themselves, they think that the Almighty has created millions of human beings out of flesh and bone solely to serve their wishes and desires. Is it to be wondered at that people who are so overwhelmed by self-love have no liking for the advance of the Iranian nation and seek to disparage and belittle it ? But our chief complaint against these writers who pour out their non sense in English newspapers and other communications is that, having cast off the bridle of self-control and self-possession which is the peculiarity of civilised man, they should so far succumb to their emotions that under their sway they should attack and assail that royal person who is the mani festation of the Iranian nation, the focus of their thoughts, their will-power and all their activities ; for we are afraid and have good reasons for our fear that if this sort of nonsense is allowed to continue, and if the bridle of restraint is removed from self-indulgence, then unpleasant results will be produced in Iran and grave consequences may follow in that Anglo- Iranian relations may be seriously damaged. Our readers are of course aware that the foreign press was discussed recently in the Majlis and that, at the request of certain deputies, no restric tion was placed on the entry of the newspapers and publications containing this sort of rubbish ; naturally this nonsense will circulate among the people and we are sure that it will have most injurious effects on the minds of Iranians and it is possible that unpleasant consequences may follow from this. Sup posing that the policy of the Government does not require that action should be taken in this matter or that any notice or attention should be paid to these idle tales, who then will re-assure us that wise and sensible people will act in the same way and will not get excited at these poisonous scourgings inflicted on their nerves ? Nevertheless, on the strength of the knowledge which we have con cerning this people’s psychology, we are confident that the opposite will be the case. Iranians are full of forbearance, but not at a moment when attacks are being made on their life, prestige and honour. A history going back five and twenty centuries has given to the people of this nation such sensitiveness, such high spirit and such a pride in their country that they would rather die than, submit to insults ; especially at an29 epoch when, having discovered their ideal, they have found a brave and puissant leader who fosters, by the loftiness of his own mind and inspiration, the sentiments and the qualities which are shared by the whole nation. At the present time the Sacred Ruler of Iran is indeed the manifesta tion, in the full sense of the word, of the thoughts, the ambitions, and the glories of the people ; accordingly any disparagement or belittlement of Him amounts to a scourging of the sensory nerve of the people, especially at a time when sovereignty is embodied in the person of this great man whom the country honours as pioneer, guide, leader, and life-giving chief, as a living monument of the splendours and glories of its past, the representative of twenty-five centuries of its history. Since the entry of these rubbish publications is free and since these nonsensical documents, every line of which shows resentment, rancour and spite against the sacred spirit and the sovereignty of this nation, instead of discussing matters impartially, take advantage of every opportunity to make the sacred person of the king the target of their poisoned shafts, we do not consider it unlikely that the people will take unexpected action and, taking no thought for the safety of their own lives will, to defend their honour, resort to measures that might be regretted. The thing which particularly increases our anxiety is the evil record and the bitter, unpleasant impression which English policy has always left in this part of the world. We have not forgotten the injuries which English policy has repeatedly inflicted on this country during the last two centuries, nor the evil purposes, the selfish ambitions, and the covetousness of that Government, nor the dij lo nacy intended to weaken Iran, which it employed in this country in order that there should exist in the East of Asia an im potent, poor and needy Iran; nor have we forgotten the treaty of 1907, the aims of 1919 or a hundred other little incidents which are to be found in the history of Anglo-Iranian relations. The whole of this unsavoury record provides a very suitable reason why people should regard these perni cious compositions as poisonous attacks, dictated by self-interest and hostile to their honour and consider them to be the expression of unfriendly policy and to be an attack, the fruit of evil intentions, on the honour and progress of the Iranian nation. We do not think it necessary at the moment to pursue this matter furthr and shall wait until the newspapers and publications-in question reach Iran. Then we shall enter into the discussion in a comprehensive and detailed manner and refute all their nonsense. MINUTE SHEET. POURQUOI LA PRESSE ANGLAISE REPAND DU VENIN ?

Ces publications mesquines, d’un esprit bas meritent tout de meme qu’on y prdte une certaine attention, ne futce que pour mettre les choses au point. II faut dire tout d’abord que ces publications sont un tissu de menson- ges, empreintes d’un esprit tendancieux et d’intrigues et qu’elles ont leur source dans des milieux degeneres. On n’y trouve aucune delicatesse, aucune politesse, ni aucun respect a ces principes du journalisme, de la presse dont le devoir de conscience est de propager la v4rite. 17 (S) ead.34 It is unfortunate, however, that the local authorities have so far seemed to be unable or unwilling to appreciate the present friendly attitude of this Consu late. It is to be hoped that the closing of the Soviet Consulate with the suspicions and unhappy memories it has evoked in the past may perhaps pave the way to a franker and more reasonable attitude on the part of the local Authorities here towards this Consulate. 6.

All Consuls—Circular No. 7. ^ave the honour to inform Your Lordship that on the 12th February His Majesty s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr reported that the local authori ties at that town had been instructed that all foreign and Iranian Jews must lea,ve Persia within three months. Captain Bazalgette added that this order would affect one Bntish Indian subject who had been in Abadan twenty years as a money-lender and shopkeeper. This individual had appealed to him for assistance. Subsequently Captain Bazalgette stated that the expul- sion was apparently only from the province of Khuzistan, and that he was endeavouring to obtain full information from the Governor of Khorram- shahr. His Majesty s Consul at Ahwaz reported that the Jews at that town bee . n ordered to leave, and that the order was apparently confined to the frontier zones, but that it was uncertain whether foreign Jews were re- quired to leave Iran or only the frontier zones. 8 „ f Enquiries were made by a member of my staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the subject, but the Ministry disclaimed all knowledge of any order for the expulsion of Jews, and the Iraqi Minister, with whom I had a conversation on the subject, appears to have been equally unsuccessful in eliciting any definite reply. The Tehran representative of the Anelo- Iraman Oil Company, however, has confirmed that the order for the expulsion of Jews from frontier areas has in fact been given, and that it applies to em p oyee.-, of the Company, a point which was previously in doubt.

The President of the Council, when I called on him today before my de parture on leave, asked me about the progress of the negotiations between His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom and the Soviet Government on the subject of Consulates. I said that His Majesty’s Government had been desirous of retaining the post at Leningrad, but that I had not yet heard the result of the discussions. 2. His Excellency told me that the Soviet Union would probably retain in Iran only one Consular post—that as Pahlevi, which was required for shipping. The Iranian Government desired to keep two consular posts in the Soviet Union, at Baku and Ashgabad, but I gathered that only one w r ould in fact be accepted by the Soviet Government. The Soviet Consular post at Meshed would also be closed, and His Excellency said that this would be entirely satisfactory from the Iranian point of view, as the Consulate had been in former years a centre of propaganda and, while this had been stop ped, it was still a potential source of trouble. 3. As regards the deportation of Iranians from the Soviet Union, Mon sieur Jam said that he thought it possible ^that the number to be expelled might reach between forty and sixty thousand. He thought that this movement was not entirely to be regretted as the immigrants “ if not too sev erely infected ” by Soviet ideas, should be a valuable addition to Iran’s labour force. In fact, he said, he would have no difficulty in finding room and work for hundreds, instead of tens of thousands. 4.

Few factors can affect the life of Consular officers serving in Iran more closely than the restrictions and the customs duties placed by the Iranian Government on imported goods. His Majesty’s Legation are in the best posi tion to give a comprehensive account of existing import restrictions as they affect Consular officers, and I therefore considered it desirable that a summary of these restrictions should be prepared in His Majesty’s Legation after the receipt of the reports submitted from the various consular posts in Iran. I now have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a memorandum on the subject prepared by Mr. Young. I think that this memorandum should prove useful to Consular officers proceeding to Iran, and I would suggest that it might be shown to them together with the report submitted from the post to which they have been appointed. 3.

Import restrictions and special customs requirements in Iran, as they ^ affect Consular officers. 1. Iranian Foreign Trade Monopoly, and the system of Import Licences .— All foreign trade is legally a monopoly of the Iranian Government. Private individuals may only import goods against an official licence issued by the Ministry of Commerce. This regulation is not relaxed in the case of foreign diplomatic and consular representatives. These licences take from one to three months, and in some cases even longer, to obtain. At some ports it has proved possible to obtain immediate clearance of goods against a guarantee that a licence will be produced. But this is an unofficial arrangement and no reliance can be placed on its continuance. Applications for licences are sub mitted in a prescribed form by Consulates to the Legation, who transmit them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consular officers proceeding to Iran should therefore arrange with their posts for lists of the goods which they propose to import to be forwarded to the Legation with the required application forms and Persian translations. A detailed specification of the nature of the goods is not required. They may be classified in such categories as ‘ household effects ’, ‘ groceries ’, ‘ alcoholic drinks ’ etcetera. The lists should include a statement shewing the value of the goods, their country of origin, the customs post by which they will enter the country, and the approximate date of their arrival. In the case of a car, the make, horse-power, engine and chassis numbers should also be given. (Personal effects which a consular officer will have with him on his arrival at the frontier need not be included in the lists, as no import licence is necessary for these). In cases of great urgency the necessary information may be sent direct by the consular officer to the Legation, who will prepare the applica tion forms. In view of the time taken to extract licences from the Iranian authorities, it is in all cases most desirable that applications for licences should reach the Legation as long as possible in advance of the arrival of the goods at the fron tier. In the case of an officer newly posted to Iran (unless he is to join the staff of the Legation), it is unfortunately impossible to send in to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs any application in his name until the Iranian Government have agreed to his appointment. Nevertheless, it is strongly urged that applications should be sent to the Legation as soon as possible, in order that the Legation may be able to forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as soon as the agrement is received. 2. Special Restrictions. —The requirement of import licences applies equal ly to all categories of goods. In addition, certain articles are subject to special restrictions. The following is a summary of those by which consular officers are most likely to be affected :— (а) Arms and ammunition. —A decision of the Council of Ministers is needed before these may be imported. The time required to obtain an import licence for them is therefore even longer than in the case of ordinary goods. As sporting weapons and am munition are likely to suffer from a prolonged stay in the customs, consular officers are advised to apply for the import licences well in advance of the date on which the consignment is due to be despatched from the United Kingdom or India, allowing a minimum of three months for obtaining the import licences. (б) Seeds and plants. —To import seeds, plants, bulbs, etcetera, a licence from the Central Agricultural Department, as well as an ordinary import licence, is required. Consular officers should therefore send to the Legation, in addition to an application for an import licence, an application for the permission of the Agricultural Department : this latter application should be accompanied by a certificate from a Government Department of the country of origin of the seeds, testifying that they are all free from disease. A copy of this certificate should, in addition, accompany the seeds themselves.At present only three frontier Customs posts are authorised to inspect and admit seeds etcetera into the country : these are Khorram- shahr, Khosrovi and Pahlevi. Seeds imported through other customs posts must be sent to the nearest office of the Depart ment of Agriculture, which may be at some distance. Thus seeds imported at Bushire must be sent up to Shiraz for examina tion. {c) Dangerous Drugs. —For the import of certain drugs classified as dangerous, a licence from the Police authorities is required, in addition to an ordinary import licence. This regulation does not apply, however, to proprietary brands of medicine in made-up form, for which an ordinary import • licence only is required. As these are all that is normally required for private supplies of medicine, no undue difficulty should be encountered. (d) Wireless sets .—Permission to import wireless transmitting sets cannot be obtained. For wireless receiving sets the ordinary import licence must be obtained. In addition the sets must be inspected in the customs by officials of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, who satisfy themselves that they are not trans mitting sets. At present this inspection can only be carried out at the Customs Houses at Tehran, Tabriz and Kermanshah. But it has been found possible to arrange for the importation of sets through other Customs Houses by sending to the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs full specifications of the set. The Ministry then certify that it is only a receiving set. For sets which are to be imported through Customs Houses other than those named above, consular officers should send to the Lega tion, with the ’application for an import permit, a copy of the makers’ catalogue or leaflet describing the set with specifica tions, and a copy of the invoice. A permit from the police is required for the installation of a set, but in practice it has not been found necessary to obtain installation permits for sets used inside Consulate premises. 3. Monopoly Taxes .—The import, manufacture and sale of tobacco, tea and sugar are the monopoly of the Iranian Government. For the import of tobacco, cigars, cigarettes etcetera, in addition to an ordinary import licence, a permit from the Tobacco Monopoly in Tehran is required. Application for this should be made on a special form, copies of which may be obtained from the provincial customs authorities, or from the Legation. Before the tobacco may be cleared from the customs, a monopoly tax of 200 per cent, ad valorem must be paid. Monopoly taxes are also payable on imported tea and sugar, but no special licence is required to import them (see below under Franchise). 4. Franchise .—On first appointment to a post in Iran, whether in a substantive or acting capacity, a consular officer has nine months’ customs franchise, dating from the day of his arrival in the country. This conqwises exemption from customs dues only, and not from the necessity of obtaining import licences nor, at present, from the payment of monopoly taxes. The latter point is, however, being contested and it is possible that some modifica tion of this regulation may be obtained. On his arrival at the frontier, a newly-appointed consular officer may bring in free of duty and without import licences, such personal effects as be has with him. A fairly wide interpretation of the expression ‘ personal effects ’ is permissible, and it may be taken to include, for instance, a moderate supply of tobacco. 5. Unrestricted Articles. —Newspapers, magazines and books packed with open ends normally come through unrestricted. No import licences are required for them. Articles sent by letter post are often delivered without customs formali ties, but it is impossible to be certain of this. i7(S) ead38 6. The following is a summary of the action which a consular officer newly posted to Iran, is advised to take before leaving for his post :— {a) He should inform the Legation as early as possible by which fron tier post he intends to enter the country, giving the approximate date on which he expects to reach it. (b) He should inform the Legation of any goods which he intends to import, giving details as indicated in section I. This should be done as long as possible before the goods are expected to arrive. If time allows, he should arrange with his post for the submission to the Legation of applications for import licences in the usual form. (c) Give details in ample time of any articles mentioned in Section 2, and of any consignment of tobacco which he will not have with him on arrival. 7. The above applies primarily to Consular officers posted to the provinces. The case of those who are members of the Legation staff is different, since they enjoy diplomatic status. Their period of franchise is therefore not limited to nine months, and they are exempt from the monopoly dues mentioned in Section 3. They must, however, obtain import licences, and consulau officers expecting to proceed to Tehran are advised to follow the instructions given in the preceding paragraph. 1251 Copy to India No. 38. Baghdad No. 11. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 91 (339/7/38), dated the 9th March 1938. With reference to Mr. Seymour’s telegram No. 26 fS. No. (15)] of the 25th February, reporting the death of Monsieur Samiy, Minister of Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency Monsieur Adh Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Personalities in Iran, 1937, No. 3), who recently acted as President of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva, has been appointed Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs. 2. A well-informed colleague recently told His Majesty’s Minister that Monsieur Adi stood little chance of being made Minister for Foreign Affairs. He is regarded as being of official or legal, rather than of ministerial timber. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department and to His MajestyV Representative at Baghdad.

M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London No. 64 (79/3/38), dated the 18th February 1938. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a Decree governing the formation and activities of clubs and similar institutions in Tran, which was passed by the Council of Ministers on the 27th December, 1937. The restrictions which it imposes are much more severe than those hitherto in force. 2. It will be seen that the measure provides in detail for complete police control of all club activities and that any sort of political discussion is categorically prohibited.33 3. The only article worthy of separate mention is the tenth, which lays down that, although a club may be reserved for the subjects of a single state, no club is permitted to admit certain nationalities and exclude others. I his decree seems only too likely to render still worse the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in which Iranians have to live and to provide fresh opportuni ties for the informer and the black-mailer. That the police intend to enforce it is indicated by the experience of Le Club de Golf Suleimanieh which, under pohce pressure, had already completed most of the formalities prescribed in the decree before it was passed by the Council of Ministers. (Translation). CLUBS. Decree concerning Clubs, Reading-rooms, and similar Societies. Text PUBLISHED IN THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE GAZETTE OF THE 14TH DaI (4th January, 1938), No. 2682. Decree.

Baghdad No. 12. - Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office,' London, No. 93-E., dated the 9th March 1938. With reference to Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 117-E of the 27th March, 1937 [S. No. (27) in F. No. 9-N/37], I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the estimates of the budget for the Iranian year 1317 (the 21st March 1938 to the 20th March 1939). 2. The budget has been balanced with a surplus of nearly twenty-four thousand pounds, and as usual the press is full of praise and attributes this satisfactory state of affairs to His Imperial Majesty. 3. The total revenue is estimated at 1,528,892,648 rials (just over 19 million pounds), an increase of 281,093,837 rials (3-5 million pounds) on the budget estimates for 1937-38. Expenditure is estimated at 1,527,018,564 rials, showing an increase of 278,986,827 rials (3*4 million pounds) over last year’s figure. 4. On the revenue side an increase of 15 million rials (£185,000) over last year’s estimate is expected from direct taxation and 14 million rials (£160,000) from indirect taxation. As so far there has been no indication that the Government are contemplating the introduction of any new taxes, the increases are anticipated from taxes already in force. 5. The receipt from Customs, which for the year 1937-38 were estimated at 362 million rials (£4-5 million), are shown at 421 million rials (£5*25 mil lion) in the estimates for the new year, an increase of 59 million rials. Re ceipts from the monopoly companies are also expected to increase by 62 million rials (£775,000). Other notable increases include 46 million rials which the mining industry is expected to yield, and 50 million rials from Govern? ment investments.41 6. On the expenditure side an increase of 45 million rials (£562,500) is shown in the estimates of the Ministry of War, which, including the gendar merie, amount to 354,408,380 rials (£4,430,000) or nearly 24 per cent, of the whole budget. The estimates for 1937-38 amounted to 309 million rials (£3,867,600). 7. The Ministry of Public Instruction’s estimates are similarly on the increase for, whereas they amounted to 71 million rials in the previous budget, they are now increased to 81 million rials. 8. On the other hand a notable drop in expenditure is shown in the esti mates of the Ministry of Roads and Communications where under the item railways, a sum of 105 million rials (£1,312,500) is budgeted for 1938-39 as compared with 200 million rials (£2,500,000) in the previous budget. This decrease of £1,187,500 is presumably due to the fact that exploitation of all the northern section of the railway from Bander Shah to Tehran and on to Qum, has already commenced, and that several expensive lots in the Southern Section have been completed by the contractors. 9. The estimates of the Ministry of Industry and Mines have increased from 154 million rials (£1,900,000) in the previous budget to 256 million rials (£3,200,000) for the new year. This year’s estimates include credits in respect of the following : 101 million rials for the administration of mines, 36 million rials for the completion and exploitation of the cement factory, 30 million rials in connexion with the spinning and weaving industry, 92 million rials to assist the sugar industry (this figure includes the sum of 7,300,000 rials to be paid to the Banque Mellie, Iran in respect of interest and capital), 18 million rials for the glycerine and soap factory now in course of construction near the cement factory at Tehran, and 14 million rials for the construction of the gas mask factory which is also being installed close to Tehran. 10. Other items of interest which appear under “ miscellaneous expenses ” include the sum of 17 million rials for the building of new customs ware houses, 1,500,000 rials increased capital of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, 60 million rials in connexion with the silos which are now being erected in various grain centres, 5 million rials for the construction of a new factory for husking rice, 10 million rials for the purchase of a sand carrier boat, and 30 million rials towards the stabilisation of cereal prices. 11. The annual payments of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited, for royalties and taxation are not included in the budget : these are always paid into the Government reserves abroad and are used when important purchases in foreign currency have to be effected. Proceeds of the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax, devoted to railway construction, and the bulk of the Road Tax are also left out of the budget. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad.

T. India No. 49. Baghdad No. 15. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 113 (82-4-38), dated the 24th March 1938. I have the honour to report that it has been announced that work has- been started on a branch line to connect Semnan with the Trans-Iranian Railway at Qishlaq, 114-5 kilometres from Tehran. The new line will be of about 114 kilometres and is intended for the transport to the foundry under construction at Aminabad of the Semnan iron deposits. I understand that no great engineering difficulties are involved in this scheme. 2. Work on the southern section of the railway is being hastened, and it would appear that the whole line might be completed by the end of this year. 3. I understand that a stock of 30,000 tons of cement is held at the fac tory near Tehran for use on the Tehran-Tabriz Railway, which will presum ably be commenced on the completion of the Trans-Iranian. The proposed alignment will apparently follow the Tehran-Tabriz road up to Zendjan, when it will turn to the west in order to avoid the mountainous districts, and will probably go near Saoudjbulagh and through Maragha to Tabriz. From Tabriz to Qotur on the Trurkish frontier the branch line of the Djulfa Railway, from Sofian to Sharafkhansh on the northern shore of Lake Urmia, may be used, or possibly a new branch line may be laid from Morand through Khoi to Qotur. Though the detour from Zendjan will lengthen the distance from Tehran to Tabriz, it is expected to save expenditure as apparently very little tunnelling will be necessary. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of'Overseas Trade, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad. ( 29 ) Copies to :•—India No. 54. Baghdad No. 18. Ahwaz No. 21. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 120 (272-12-38), dated the 26th March 1938. With reference to Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 75 [S. No. (22)] of the 25th February, I have the honour to inform you that on the 14th March, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr reported that a final order had been received there that all Jews must leave there within three months. No similar order has been issued at Ahwaz, though rumours are current there that Jews in that town, the majority of whom are Iraqi subjects, will be ordered to leave on the expiry of the period of grace given to the Jews at Khorramshahr. 2. No orders for the expulsion of Jews from frontier regions have been reported from other parts of Iran. It seems clear that the present action of the authorities is confined to the frontier regions of Khuzistan, and that it is the result of the smuggling activities of the Jews in that area. His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz reports that the success with which the Jew*s have evaded the exchange restrictions has aroused the resentment of their business competitors, and that it appears likely that the powerful local merchant, Mirza Jallal Mowaqqir, head of the Sherkat-i-Kashtirani Karun and other concerns, has used his influence with Colonel Bayendor to oust business rivals in this way.3. The British subject mentioned in the first paragraph of Mr Seymour’s despatch under reference, has decided not to resist the order to leave Khuzis- tan, and he will shortly proceed to India. It appears that he fears the result of any investigation into his financial affairs. 4. It is reported that forty-five Iranian Jews employed by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company must leave Abadan, and that the Company will be in convenienced by their departure. I have, however, still no information suggesting that the order will be applied to European British subjects in the Company’s employ. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary of the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department, to His Majesty’s Ambas sador at Baghdad and to His Majesty’s Consular Representative at Ahwaz.

No. (28)] of the 26th March, I have the honour to report that I have now learnt from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr that the police in that town have announced that Jews will not after all be expelled. 2.

No. (30)] of the 4th April, I have the honour to report that the Iraqi Minister came to talk to me yester day about developments in connexion with the expulsion order made against Jews by the Iranian authorities in Khuzistan. 2. It appears that Monsieur Suleyman, having failed for about four weeks to obtain any answer to his enquiries, first oral then written, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs* interviewed the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 20th March. The latter declared that the expulsion order had been a general one against Iranian as well as Iraqi Jews, issued because they were engaged in smuggling. Monsieur Suleyman pointed out that he w as not interested in action taken against Iranian Jews, but if measures were taken by the Iranian Government against Iraqi Jews, he was entitled to see some evidence for their justification. These measures were, he continued, a poor first' fruit of the treaties recently signed between Iraq and Iran, and* he added on his own that if the measures against Iraqi Jews were proceeded with, his Government would feel obliged to take counter measures against Iranian merchants in Baghdad. He did not believe that Iraqi Jews in Khor ramshahr or Abadan had taken part in any actual smuggling which, he said, they left to Iranians. The right course for the Iranian Government to follow would, he urged, be to prosecute any Jews against whom they had evidence, but not to take general measures on suspicion. 17(S)EAD46 3. On the following (Lay, the 21st March, Monsieur Adi told the Iraqi Minister that he had spoken to the Shah, and that the expulsion order had been cancelled. The announcement of this in Khorramshahr was reported in my despatch under reference. Monsieur Suleyman, in reply to an enquiry by me, assured me that the revocation of the order was a general one, and did not only apply to Jews of Iraqi nationality. 4.

This amendment to Article 17 of the Irano-German Payment Clearing Agreement of the 30th October, 1935 removes the discrimination in favour of German imports into Iran mentioned in paragraph 4 of Sir Hughe Knatchbull- Hugessen’s despatch No. 576-E [S.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 115 (84-4-38), dated the 26th March 1938. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a notice issued by the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs regarding the extension to Baghdad of the existing weekly air-mail service to Kermanshah.2. The aeroplane is to leave Tehran each Tuesday. Letters sent by it should therefore catch the westbound flying~boat which leaves Hebbaniya on Friday morning. The aeroplane will return to Tehran on Wednesday morning each week, and should accordingly bring up to Tehran letters arriv ing by the land-plane which reaches Baghdad on Sunday evening. 3. It remains, however, to be seen whether the Iranian Government have really made effective arrangements for the connections at Bagdad, and I am asking His Majesty’s Embassy at Baghdad to be so good as to enquire on this point. 4. The minimum postage on a letter to go all the way by air to the United Kingdom or India is Rials 7 • 00. This charge is made up as follows : To the ordinary foreign postage of Rials 1 • 50 is added first a charge of Rials 4-00 (which already existed for letters intended to be sent by air-mail from Bagdad, even before there was any Iranian air-mail service), and second, the further charge of Rials 1 • 50 mentioned in the enclosed notice. The minimum charge is thus the equivalent at the official rate of exchange of no less than 1/9. 5. The first aeroplane for Bagdad duly left on Tuesday, the 15th March. Owing to the shortness of the notice given, the load of mail carried is said to have been very small. The aeroplane’s return was delayed by a dust-storm in Bagdad and heavy snow storms in Iran. The functioning of this service will be watched with interest. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. Translation of a Notice issued by the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Tele phones, dated the 21st Esfand, 1316 (12th March, 1938), No. 25536175.- NOTICE. The Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones brings it to the notice of the public that as from Tuesday, the 24th Esfand, 1316 (15th March, 1938), the air mail service between Tehran and Kermanshah will be extended to Bagdad. This service will operate once a week for the time being until further notice, and the following extra charge will be levied on mails from Tehran and Kermanshah to Bagdad, in addition to the regular rates 1. On letters. Rials 1-50 for every 20 grammes, or less. 2. On plain post cards, Rials 1*50 each. 3. On other mail, such as printed matter, commercial matter, etc., 30 dinars for every 25 grammes, or less. Parcels destined for abroad are not accepted for the time being for car riage by the air mail service. ^ Air mail letters for foreign countries must be delivered to the special air mail counters in Tehran and Keimanshah by 5 p.m. on Mondays, and by noon of the same day to the Post Offices in the Capital. Senders must write “ Air Mail ” in clear writing on their letters, and indicate the route they are to follow. A special air mail label will be affixed by the Post Office on all air mail letters. Conditions concerning the transport of passengers and their luggage will be announced later. MOHAMMAD HAKIMI, For Minister of P., T. &amp; T. ( 34 ) Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, No. 63, dated the 8 th April 1938. I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz recently reported that the Director of the southern section, of the Trans-Iranian Railway, according to information from a fairly reliable source, had proposed to the Ministry of Communications that about fifty48 Indian engine-drivers should be engaged, either through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company or through Iranian Consuls in India. For some time there has been a serious shortage of capable drivers on the southern line. In the summer of 1937 an attempt was made to recruit drivers in Iraq, but only one or two were engaged. 2. Mr. Gardener’s report has been confirmed by the Tehran Representa tive of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who was approached orally by the Ministry of Finance on the subject about a month ago. Mr. Rice informed the Ministry of Finance that his Company would be ready to help in putting suitable candidates in touch with Iranian Consuls in India, but that they could not engage candidates themselves. The Iranian Government’s desire to engage Indian drivers is very welcome to the Company, who are experienc ing serious difficulties at present owing to the shortage of skilled Iranian la bour, while they are obliged under their Concession progressively to eliminate non-Iranian labour. That the Iranian authorities should require foreign en gine-drivers obviously strengthens the Company’s plea that they must be allowed to recruit skilled labour abroad. 3. Mr. Gardener has, however, pointed out that there is a danger that Indian drivers recruited by the Iranian Government may find their conditions of employment far from satisfactory. There is in the first place the exchange difficulty. Even with contracts providing for payment of a part of their salary in foreign exchange, drivers might well find difficulty under exist ing conditions, in remitting funds to India. Mr. Gardener also states that drivers on the southern line are subject to constant blackmailing by the re pair-shop staff, because of a system of fines imposed when repairs to engines are required through the alleged fault of the driver. Unless a driver bribes the repair-shop staff sufficiently, he is repeatedly fined for the repairs required for his engine. (The Tehran Representatve of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who are usually very well informed on all that goes on in their area, was not able to confirm the existence of these conditions on the southern line). It is also said that Iranian engine-drivers receive wages of no more than Rials 200 a month (a motor-driver may earn as much as Rials 1,000 a month), and that as a result almost everything detachable has disappeared from the engines on the southern line. Mr. Gardener states that most of the Parsee drivers originally engaged have left on account of the bad conditions, and that the remainder are either men of bad reputation or are prevented from leaving by the fact that they cannot obtain the arrears of pay due to them. 4. In these circumstances Mr. Gardener has suggested that it is not ad visable that Indian drivers should accept the offer of employment from the Iranian Government. I do not consider that it is necessary or desirable to take any active steps to discourage Indian drivers from coming to Iran. Such action would certainly be resented by the Iranian Government. But I think that the Protector of Emigrants should be aware that conditions of service on the Iranian railways are not good, and that in particular great care should be taken to ensure that all contracts include a clause providing for payment of half the salary in rupees, transferable to India. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and to His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affairs, Tehran, No. 63 [S. No. (34)], dated the 8th April 1938.{Received on 24th April 1938 with Political Secretary''s letter No. 14, dated the 7th April 1938.) PERSIA. March 14, 1938. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 1392/1178/34] Copy No. 76. Mr. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—{Received March 14.) (No. 66. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, February 18, 1938. I HAVE the honour to report that, according to information supplied by the Belgian Minister at Tehran, the Iranian Government have recently concluded a contract for the purchase of 200,000 rifles and 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition from Czechoslovakia. I presume this purchase must have been made from the Skoda factory. 2. The counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation, to whom this information was given, gathered that the terms of the contract were severe, namely 184,000 United States dollars down, and the remainder (the sum was not stated) on delivery. It appears, if this information is correct, that the Skoda firm have cut out a Belgian firm, as they did in 1936 over a similar order for 200,000 rifles. M. Braeffe said that we were paying for the rifles, referring no doubt to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company royalties. 3. He also said that Colonel Bever was impressed by the aircraft factory outlay—tools included. The Iranian Government wanted to renew Colonel Bever’s contract for another year, but there might be some difficulty as it was time that Colonel Bever took an active command in the Belgian army. I have, &amp;c. H. J. SEYMOUR. ( 37 ) India No. 33 of 2nd March 1938. Confidential letter from the Military Attach^ to Hts Majesty’s Minister, British Legation, Tehran, No. 61/1/1938, dated the 26th February 1938. I have the honour to forward herewith three copies of a report on the military review which was held on the 22nd February at the Jelalieh parade ground on the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the Coup d’Etat. Copies have been sent to the Director of Military Operations and Intelli gence, The War Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1. The Senior General Staff Officer, Army Headquarters, India, New Delhi and the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, Air Headquarters, Dhibban, Iraq. The arrangements for the parade were precisely the same as in the past two years. Immediately after his arrival. His Imperial Majesty The Shah mounted his charger and rode past the front rank of the leading formations. The troops cheered. He was accompanied by the Crown Prince and a staff of six. After his return to the royal pavilion sixty-five aeroplanes flew over the parade in formation. They consisted of “ Tiger-Moths ” in six flights of five each and 44 Audax and Furies ” in seven flights of five each. The march past then started. The order was as follows : (1) Girl Guides 40 troops of an average strength of 25. (2) Boy Scouts 70 troops of an average strength of 20. (3) Students from the secondary schools—75 platoons of an average strength of 40. 17 (S) EAD.50 (4) The Cadets of the military college—infantry, engineers and cavalry 16 platoons and 4 troops of an average strength of 60. (5) The Iranian Navy 3 platoons. (6) Air Force Officers Training School 1 platoon. (7) Air Force 0. Ranks 2 platoons. (8) Engineers 2 battalions (one from each infantry division). (9) Infantry. The 4 regiments (of 3 battalions each} comprising the 1st Division. (10) Mountain Artillery. On pack mules—75 mm. Bofors— 6x4 gun batteries of the 1st Division and 6x4 gun batteries of the 2nd Division. (11) Field Artillery. 12x4 gun batteries of Skoda 105 mm.—horse drawn. About half were drawn by the heavy Hungarian horses recently imported and half by locally bred horses. (12) Cavalry. 4 regiments. (13) Cavalry School. 7 troops. (14) Horse Artillery. 3x4 gun batteries of 1901 Schneider. 75 pdr. (obsolete and unserviceable). (15) Armoured Cars. 2 companies. Each of 2 Rolls-Royce and 6 Marmon Herrington.

(20) Mechanized A. A. Artillery. 2x4 gun batteries of Bofors 75 mm. guns with Marmon Herrington tractors. Notes. (I) The shortage of officers and especially senior officers was very noticeable. Regi ments were commanded by Majors and Battalions by Captains. Only one battery had more than one officer. Some weeks ago there was a rumour to the effect that 52 senior officers had been placed under arrest. (II) The mules were much improved. They were of a good stamp and in fine condition. (III) The turn out of the men showed a slight improvement over last year but leather articles of equipment and boots in particular are still in a poor state. (IV) The marching and dressing was better than last year. ( 38 ) Copy to India No. 52. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 116 (95/6/38), dated the 25th March 1938. With reference to Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 446 of the 4th December last, I have the honour to report that I have now learnt from His Majesty’s Consul for Khuzistan that the rebel Bahmai chieftain, together with a number of his relatives and followers, has at last surrendered. The reascJh appears to be that the locally engaged militia, backed by the military, hunted the re bels from mountain to mountain, inflicting losses and finally captured Khoda Karam Khan’s chief wife. By this vigorous pursuit the rebels’ morals was crushed and all is now reported quiet in Kuhgilu.51 2. On the orders of Tehran, Khoda Karam Khan and his intimate fol lowers to the number of about seventy were shot, photographs being taken before and after the execution. The military plundered the outlaws’ camp and No. 13 regiment arrived badk in Ahwaz laden with loot. It is stated that various Bahmai prisoners in Ahwaz are to be settled at Ahu Dasht. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department. ( 39 ) Copy to India No. 66. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 147, dated the 9th April 1938. I have the honour to inform you that Colonel Pybus, late Military Attache to this Legation, prior to his departure expressed the wish that I should seek to obtain for him a parting interview with the Shah, an honour that had been granted to some, possibly to all of his predecessors, including Colonel Dodd whom Colonel Pybus relieved here. 2. Upon consulting precedent, I found that although there seemed some doubt as to previous practice, Colonel Dodd had certainly been granted an audience on departure, and that it appeared to be the custom also for the new Military Attache to be presented to His Imperial Majesty. As on this occa sion Colonel Underwood was to overlap with Colonel Pybus for several days, I wrote to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs a letter enquiring whether the Shah would grant the customary interviews or on this occasion combine them in one. I enclose a copy of my letter. At the same time I spoke to the Head of the Protocol Department and asked his good offices in the submis sion of my request to the Shah in the most appropriate manner. 3. Having received no reply two days previous to Colonel Pybus’ depar ture, but having heard from the Protocol Department that the Ministry had communicated with the Court, I called upon Monsieur Ansarie to ascertain the position. After some telephoning, he went to see Monsieur Adi. On return he told me that a copy of my letter had been sent to the Court under cover of a letter from the Ministry which put to the Shah the question of the principle of His Imperial Majesty receiving foreign Military Attaches per sonally. An answer had now been received that the Shah did not feel that he could extend to the incoming or outgoing British Military Attache, a pri vilege that he did not give to the Military Attaches of other countries. The privileged Military Attche at Tehran is now the Turk : it is a fact that neither he nor the French Military Attache had the honour of an Audience with the Shah on arrival. 4. Monsieur Ansarie suggested that the interviews given to Colonel Dodd and to Colonel Pybus on his arrival were exceptional and should not be con sidered as precedents. I told Monsieur Ansarie that my firm belief was that these interviews had not been isolated cases but had been in accordance with practice, and I expressed regret that a traditional and greatly valued personal contact with His Imperial Majesty should now be broken. From information derived from another source it seems doubtful whether my re quest for interviews for Colonel Pybus and Colonel Underwood was actually put before the Shah. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Tehran, to His Excellency Monsieur Mustapha Adl, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran, dated the 18th March 1938. May I ask whether Your Excellency would be so very kind as to assist me in the following matter ?52 2. Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Underwood has just arrived in Tehran to take up his duties as Military Attache to this Legation in succession to Lieu tenant-Colonel G. D. Pybus. Colonel Pybus on his arrival had the honour of being presented to His Imperial Majesty The Shah, and I hope that it may be possible for the same privilege to be granted to his successor, in accordance with what I believe is the practice here in the case of Military Attaches. Should His Imperial Majesty be willing to grant an audience, it is also I believe, the practice that a retiring Military Attache has the honour of a fare well audience with His Imperial Majesty, and I trust that I may be permitted when presenting Colonel Underwood, to be accompanied by Colonel Pybus, who is anxious to pay his respects before departing from Iran. 3. Would Your Excellency please be so good as to take the necessary steps to ascertain the pleasure of His Imperial Majesty with regard to this matter ? 4. I venture to mention, for Your Excellency’s own private information that according to present arrangements Colonel Pybus proposes to leave Tehran on about the 26th March (6th Farvardin, 1317).

I will continue to press for an early reply. (Enclosure in Air Mail letter from Secretary, Political and Secret Depart ment, India Office, No. 15, dated the 13th April 1938.)

If a suitable candidate of rank suggested is available I would suggest if possible I should now inform Persian Government as to rate of pay (and proportion payable in sterling) that you consider they should offer on assumption that living quarters are made available and also as to leave that you consider should be granted. If I continue to press for an offer from this side I am sure there will be interminable delay. 3. I think it is pretty clear candidate should be a bachelor.

With reference to my telegram No. 21 of the 6th April regarding the desire of the Persian Government to engage the services of an expert in hydrogra phy and meteorology, I transmit to you the accompanying copy of a letter on the subject from the Admiralty. 2. The letter explains the reason why it is not possible to meet the Persian Government’s wish that the candidate should be of junior rank. It shews also the manner in which the salary is assessed. 3. I understand that the Admiralty would not insist on the officer re ceiving the extra seven days’ leave mentioned in paragraph 6 of their letter during^ his period of service with the Persian Government. 4. I understand, also, that the officer would be likely to wish to bring his wife with him. Letter from Admiralty, London, to the Foreign Office, No. (E. 1875/ 226/34) C. W. 3476/38, dated the 2nd April 1938 1 . With reference to Foreign Office letter E. 6691/5066/34 I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inform you that they are prepared to second for a period of two years an officer qualified in meteorology and hydrographic surveying for service with the Persian government. 2. My Lords regret that the Persian request for an officer of Lieutenant’s rank cannot be met. Such an officer would not only be comparatively in experienced but might be hard put to it to assert his authority and get his wishes attended to. Professionally a Lieutenant Commander would be suitable ; and from the point of view of prestige and authority My Lords consider that the usual practice should be followed and that he should be given the acting rank of Commander. 3. The emoluments of this officer would consist of the difference between his naval full pay (£623* 10-0^.) and his half pay as Lieutenant-Commander (£281-7-ld.) (which would be paid from Navy funds), plus a consoli dated allowance of £682-17-Id. This latter sum includes the naval allowances to which he is entitled—marriage allowance, survey pay, etc.— and also some compensation for the cost of living in a foreign country, and for bad climatic conditions. In addition the Persian Government would be re quired to bear the sum of £80 a year to cover the possible expense to navy votes in respect of attributable disability, retired pay, etc. The total charge to Persia would thus be £1,105 a year. 17 (S) EADr~ 54 4. Two alternative methods of payment present themselves : (a) emolu ments could be issued to the officer direct from the Admiralty, recovery being made by this department from Persia ; (6) a salary could be paid by the Persian government. In both cases half-pay would be issued direct. My Lords consider that though part of the salary would be spent locallv, payment of the whole sum in sterling would be reasonable. 5. It is regretted that the only officer available is married, and apparently it is doubtful whether married quarters will be available. In the event of the officer wishing to take his wife with him some provision towards the up keep of a separate establishment would also be required. 6. The leave period would be 30 days a year, to be cumulative at the officer’s option, together with a period not exceeding 7 days in all for service in hot climates. Full pay sick leave is allowed for officers serving in hot climates, up to a maximum of 18 months, but presumably the contract would be terminated at the end of a year in the case of serious illness; 7. I am to request you to communicate these proposals to the Persian government. When a satisfactory arrangement has been reached a formal contract will, of course, be drawn up.

( 46 ) Copies to India No. 79. , D. 0. T. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 161, dated the 22nd April 1938. I have the honour to report that on the 13th April, the Journal de Teheran contained an inconspicuous announcement that on the previous day Monsieur Ala had vacated his post of Minister of Commerce, to which he had been appointed on the creation of that Ministry in October last, as reported in Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 379 of the 7th October. 2. Little definite is known of the reasons which led to Monsieur Ala leaving the Ministry of Commerce. In this country it is virtually impossible to resign, an'd it seems certain that Monsieur Ala must have earned the Shah’s disfavour. It is generally known that Monsieur Ala w T as opposed to the extreme monopolistic tendencies of the Government, and wished to abolish the monopoly companies, or to limit their scope. The leading directors of these companies are men of wealth and influence, many of them deputies, w r ho have made large profits out of the monopolies, and w r ho would have little difficult in showing that profits had also been made by the Ministry of Finance and the Government Banks. It w T ould therefore be easy for them to represent that. Monsieur Ala’s views stood in the w T ay of the economic progress of the country. Further, Monsieur Ala was said to be on bad terms w ith Monsieur Bader, the Minister of Finance, and also with his Under-Secretary, Monsieur Vassighi, *Haq-ul-ijra is the fee charged by the department of the Ministry of Justice wdiich collecta- debts and all money payments ordered by the Courts.61 who had long been Acting Head ofthe Department of Commerce, and who has now been appoinied Acting Minister. Monsieur Vassighi is himself believed to be heavily interested in the Monopoly Companies. Monsieur Ala had little technical knowledge of commerce, and his appointment as Minister of Com merce was doubtless not a very good one. Nevertheless the departure from the Government of a man of his ability and integrity, well-disposed to British interests, is to be regretted. He is at liberty and in good health, and it is to be hoped that he will soon find further employment. 3. Another Ministerial change has recently occurred, with the replacement of Monsieur Mehdi Farrukh, Minister of Industry and Mines, by Monsieur Abul Qasim Ferouhar, Minister of the Interior since October 1937. Mon sieur Ferouhar thus adds yet another to the varied lists of posts which he has held in the last two years. He is said to be in high favour with the Shah at present, but his new Ministry is regarded as about the most difficult and least enviable one. Pending the appointment of a new Minister of the Interior, the President of the Council of Ministers has charge of the Ministry as in 1936. 4. No appointment has yet been made to the vacant post of Minister for Foreign Affairs. There have recently been strong rumours that Monsieur Kazemi would return to this post from the Governorate-General of Eastern Ayerbaijan, but the rumours have not been confirmed. Nor has any appoint ment been made to the post of Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, vacant since the beginning of 1937. 5.

Provision for this factory was made in the budget for the Iranian year 1316 (the 21st March 1937 to the 20th March 1938), a sum of Rials 9,000,000 ^ being provided for the purpose. Th^ contract was given to the German tirm of Aver of Berlin. Construction appears to have been begun in July 1937, and by July, 1938 the production of 330 gas masks per working day of 8 hours was anticipated. The construction of the factory is now* proceeding at the village of Vanek, 6 miles North of Tehran (marked as Wanak ” on square lb. of Degree Sheet 9 M). In addition to the factory, bungalows for workmen and officials are also being erected. When the factory is ready for Production, Germans will instruct the local labour in the manufacture of the masks. It is understood that the Iranian Government hope to be able both to supply the requirements for the whole of Iran and also to export masks to neighbouring countries. 3.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 197, dated the 19th May 1938. With reference to paragraph 3 of Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 79 [S. No. (23)] of the 27th February, I have the honour to inform you that during the past few weeks large numbers of Iranian subjects, who have been expelled from the Soviet Union, have entered Iran. A press report from Tabriz of 17 (S) EAD66 the 5th May stated that during the previous week more than three thousand had crossed the frontier at Juifa, while several thousand more are reported to have arrived by steamer at Pahlevi, as many as 670 arriving on the 12th May alone on two Soviet steamers. It will be remembered that in conversation with His Majesty’s Minister in February, the Prime Minister put the total number to be expelled from the Soviet Union at 60,000 and some esti mates have been as high as 80,000. The Soviet Ambassador recently told me that the total was not more than 10,000. A conservative estimate recently obtained from a well-informed Iranian source was 15,000. 2. According to the Soviet Ambassador the persons expelled are mainly from the Caucasus, and are for the most part small merchants who would not assimilate Soviet ideas of social and commercial co-operation in the interest of the State. I gather that the families expelled have for the most part been resident some years rather than some generations in Russia. His Excellency informed me also that the expulsions were by no means confined to Iranian nationals. On the other hand, the Turkish Military Attach^, when questioned on the subject, stated that he was certain that no Turkish subjects had been expelled. , 3. At first very little publicity was given to these expulsions in Iran, and the Iranian Government appeared to be taking the line that they welcomed the return of these Iranian nationals or had even invited them to return. Rec ently, however, this attitude has been abandoned, and the newspaper Ittela’at has been permitted to publish a strongly anti-Soviet article from a corres pondent at Tabriz describing the miserable condition of the thousands of refugees arriving there. I have the honour to enclose copies of a summary of this article which appeared in the Journal de Tehran. Nevertheless, the ac quiescence of the Iranian Government in the expulsions is perhaps more significant than the appearance of this anti-Soviet article. It seems likely that the Iranian Government have had in mind the possibility that they may themselves wish to expel considerable numbers of foreign subjects, as they are already doing on a small scale with the British Berberis, and recently threaten ed to do in the case of Iraqi Jews. From a conversation with a well-informed member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I gathered that the Iranian Government objected less to the expulsions themselves than to the fact that the people expelled had not been allowed to bring out any of their property with them, and that they have reached Iran in a state of great misery. 4. Some publicity has been given to the measure taken by the Iranian Government to provide for the refugees arriving at Pahlevi and Julfa, and to arrange for their medical inspection and for the isolation of any suffering from infectious diseases such as typhus etcetera. It is understood that many of the refugees have been distributed in East Iran, and His Majesty’s Consul- General for Khorasan has reported the arrival at Meshed of many refugees in a state of destitution. There is also a certain amount of anxiety as to the social and political ideas that some of these people, in spite of their severe treatment, may bring in with them from Soviet Russia. 5. Apart from the reason for those expulsions given by the Soviet Ambas- sador, it has been difficult to find a motive for the Soviet Government having inaugurated such action now. I believe that it has long been their practice to remove their own nationals whom they regarded as undesirable from r^? n ^! er d^tricts to the interior : e.g., from the neighbourhood of Lenkoran to Siberia. Some regard the present expulsions as due to an attack of nerves, others as retaliation either for Iran s excessive patronage of German goods, oi or the boycott exercised against the Soviet Embassy and late Consulates m this country. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment ol India m the External Affairs Department, to His Majesty’s Repre sentatives at Moscow and Ankara, to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Khoras- san an o His Majesty s Consul at Tabriz. This Consulate which is near one expulsions has, as Your Lordship is aware, been tn 1 ^ ^ recent Jy* I am n0w asking Mr. Baillie to send me a report to supplement and possibly to correct the information in this despatch. »68 (62) [Enclosure in Air Mail Letter No. 21, dated 25th May 1938, from Secretary, ^ Political and Secret Department, India Office.] (Enclosure in Foreign Office Covering Letter No. E 2803/127/34, dated 19th May 1938.)

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 210 (505/12/38), dated the 3rd June 1938. With reference to my telegram No. 60 of the 27th May, I have the honour to report that the Iranian Government have spared no pains to emphasise the importance of the engagement of the Valiahd to Her Royal Highness Princess Fowzieh of Egypt. The press has reported at length the demonstra tions of enthusiasm with which the engagement has been greeted in Tehran and the provinces. The capital has been beflagged and illuminated, and every cab, taxi and motor-bus has been bedecked with flags, first Iranian only, and then Egyptian also, with white crescent and stars hastily stitched on to the green ground. When every allowance is made for the power of official compulsion behind these demonstrations there is reason to think that the Iranian people are genuinely pleased and flattered by this alliance with the ruling family of a leading Oriental state. 2. It can fairly be said that the engagement is an event of importance. I have had no recourse to books of reference, but I cannot call to mind, at any rate in at all recent times, any instance of a dynastic marriage between the ruling houses of independent sovereign states professing Islam. Moham medan queens, whatever their influence within the palace, have hitherto been of little public account. The general custom of Persian kings has been to draw upon their own countrywomen, not necessarily of illustrious birth, to fill their harems and raise their issue. The Valiahd’s engagement is therefore also an event of some historical interest. It shows royalty, both in Iran and Egypt, emerging into a stage reached long ago in Christendom, but only now in Islam. 3. This development may have a more practical significance. Islamic history has shewn the disintegrating effect of polygamy. Its effects have left their marks upon the whole fabric of society in Islamic countries, but in no way more conspicuously than in the internecine struggles for succession between sons of the same father, but different mothers, that have been the cause of so many palace revolutions, and the rock on which so many a dynasty has foundered. It seems possible that to the same set of causes should be attributed another phenomenon of oriental kingdoms, equally disastrous to the practice of government and the stability of the dynasty, namely the ruler’s habit of regarding his natural heir as his natural enemy, and so im- muning him in the harem and giving him no chance of learning the art of ruling, or of forming political contacts in his father’s lifetime. 4. From this point of view, the Shah has probably taken a wise step in following the European example of looking to another royal family for his heir’s bride. He has escaped from the atmosphere of the oriental harem. It is true that the Iranian constitution as it reads today provides that the heir to the Throne must be of Iranian parentage on both sides. There can be little doubt that the Shah will arrange the necessary modification so that, provided his son’s succession is secured and unless something catac lysmic happens in the meanwhile, when his son dies, there will be no question as to who is the queen-mother and who is the heir. ^ On this assumption, anyone who tries to upset the accession of the present Valiahd’s heir, whether another member of the royal family by another wife, or a usurper from out side will have to take into account an international complication. Thus the proposed marriage should strengthen the dynasty in more ways than one. 5. The engagement may also be regarded as bringing recognition that the Pahlevi family has “ arrived ”. It was suggested in the Annual Report from this post for 1937 that Reza Shah pays much attention to the age-old Persian view of the aristocratic, hereditary and divine right nature of monarchy. 1 This is doubtless one of the reasons why he is so sensitive to 17 (S) ead70 any mention of his humble origin in the foregin press. By alliance with the family of Muhammad Ali Pasha, in comparison with which he is an upstart, Reza Shah has definitely climbed another rung on the dynastic ladder and a grandson would be “ atavis edite regibus There is no doubt that public opinion here, so far as it exists, feels that the marriage will improve the international standing of Iran. 6. Another point of minor interest arising out of the engagement is the bridging, or perhaps ignoring, of the Sunni-Shiah cleavage, which has been an additional obstacle in the way of a monarch of Iran taking a bride from a neighbouring country. The marriage cannot be expected to be popular among the Iranian Ulema. But it seems unlikely that the views of the Ulema can count for much now, particularly when, as in the present case the younger generation, already pretty indifferent to these religious distinc tions will be influenced by the offsetting glamour of a marriage with the royal family of a country regarded as in the forefront of eastern states 7 In yet another respect the marriage may help to further one of the main items of the Shah s policy, namely the emancipation of women The presence here of a Royal Princess, with an education believed to be partlv at least European should undoubtedly help to extend the liberties that are being secured for them ; more particularly if the Princess is a daughter of 8. Finally it seems possible that in seeking this union, the Shah may have in mind an extension of the policy of the Saadabad pact. It will be remembered that in his despatch No. 189 of the 24th February, Sir Miles ampson reported a statement in the Egyptian press that Egypt would be asked to join this pact. Similar reports were current in Tehran! The press as laid much stress on the importance of the engagement as a union between oriental peoples, and though nothing has been said here to suggest that it 0 ' ,h * S “ s ‘ b * d p “* “ *“» 2U i ™ rv- 9 -, At * he moment the Iranian Prime Minister is about to leave for weddin e ea Thave atl ° n t° ?; rran g ements m connexion with the de Tehran ” the ^l'T 1 ’ t0 etlC 0S , C herewith an extract from the “ Journal e ichran ot the 3rd June, recording an interview which M Diam has ll Mufti Vl°r ^ °V hiS 11 is also announced that Mohammed id Mufti El Gazaerly Bey, now Egyptian Minister at Ankara is to revert to his previous post of Minister at Tehran in succession to Azzam Bey. me from KeXan'^ w’Jn if ° f IT* ™. terest that Tories have reached by the British. ’ 8 m ^ e iran &gt; ^ lat this betrothal has been engineered Secretarv ftft.he’fW?

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of an interesting memorandum by Mr. F. A. G. Gray, Acting Commercial Secretary to this Legation, on the mines which are now being operated at Anarak. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department, and to the Department of Overseas Trade. Anarek Mines. Anarek is about 150 kilometres NNE of Yezd. Climate is bad, water supply meagre and agriculturally the countryside is very poor. The exploitation of mineral deposits was taken up seriously about 3 years ago, when copper and a small amount of gold were found. Exploita tion for Nickel and Cobalt started in 1936, the ores producing 16 per cent, of nickel and 4 per cent of cobalt. Smelting was done at Anarek in a small plant obtained from Krupps, the products being sent to Tehran for refining. German experts in the employ of the Iranian Government have been surveying the deposits for some years and the Anarek district has developed into a rich mining centre producing copper, lead, nickel, antimony, sulphur and alum. Coal is reported to have been found in the vicinity of Siah Kuh, and it is said that gold is found in fairly large quantities. In 1937 a contract was made with Ferrostahl for the completion and perfection of the work of exploitation at Anarek. In accordance with this contract the German Company have to extract 1,000 tons of nickel and 4 000 tons of copper within the maximum period of 2 years, and this material has to be exported. The proceeds realised, on the basis of international prices will assure the expenses of the exploitation and purchase of new machinery for an increased output: the surplus after deduction of the ex penses mentioned will be paid to the Treasury on account of the Govern ment. Copper is being extracted from the mines at Sabarz-Baghereg, Talmessi and Masgani. A smelting foundry is at Talmessi and it is expected that another will shortly be available at Sabarz. All these places are in the Anarek vicinity. Nickel is extracted at Talmessi and at four other sites in the district; it is smelted at Talmessi. Antimony is extracted in the mountains called Turkamani, S. E. of Anarek. Some has been sent to Tehran. It is expected that a good deal of copper, nickel and antimony will be exported to Germany this year. Ten German experts reside at Anarek. A post and telegraph office and a wireless station have been installed, also a sub-branch of the Banque Mellie at Yezd. A small “ school of mining has been started. Several of the mines are completely surrounded by barbed wire. 17 (S) EAD74 The Isfahan paper “ Bakh tar ” of the 12th and 20th April last published calls for tenders for transport of :— 5.000 tins benzine. 3.000 „ oil gas (sic). 1,300 litres oil. 342,000 „ No. 220 oil. 160 kilos grease. 40 tins paraffin. 4,500 „ mazout (fuel oil) from Isfahan to Anarek, from Anarek to the mines at Talmessi, Sabarz- Baghereg and Masgani, and also the transport of some cases containing machinery the weight of which varies from 300 to 3,000 kilos each, from Anarek to Talmessi.

The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compli ments to the Under Secretary of State for India and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copy of the under-menti oned paper :— Despatch from His Majesty’s Representative, Tehran, No. 200, May 21st—Tunnel through Candovan Pass to Caspian Sea. P. Z. 4235/38. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 200 (498/2/38), dated the 21st May 1938. I have the honour to report that, on the 17th May, the Shah formally opened the tunnel through the Candovan Pass on the Chalons road from Tehran to the Caspian Sea.jm 7o 2. This tunnol, which is 2,060 yards in length, pierces the pass at an altitude of over 8,800 feet, and shortens the mountain road by eight miles. The cost of the tunnel, which was started early in 1935, is stated to bo Rials 24,853,400 or approximately £310,000 at the official rate of exchange. 3. It is claimed that the tunnel will make circulation over the Chalons road possible all the year round, but as the entrance and exit are apparently above snow level, the road is still liable to be blocked in mid-winter, but no doubt every effort will be made to keep this “ special road ” (Rahi Makh- sous) open. The road itself was commenced in the spring of 1932, and was officially opened by the Shah on the 1st December, 1933. It is the shortest route from the capital to the Caspian Sea, terminating at the port of No Shahr. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. Copies to :—India No. 110.

With reference to the final paragraph of my despatch No. 197 of the 19th May, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith copies of a report which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz on the subject of the recent expulsions of Iranians from the United Soviet Socialist Republic. 2. I enquired of tho Turkish Ambassador a few days ago what he con sidered were the motives behind these expulsions. He said that he thought that to some extent they were of a general nature, man}' Japanese and possibly a few Turks had been similarly expelled, but that the expulsions were also an expression of Soviet displeasure at the Iranian Government showing too much favour to another Power. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Gov ernment of India, in the External Affairs Department, to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Moscow and Ankara and to His Majesty’s Consulates at Khorassan and Tabriz. Letter from British Consulate, T abriz, to His Majesty s Minister, With reference to your despatch No. 12 of the 19th May, concerning the expulsion of Iranian subjects from the Soviet Union, I have the honour to report that it is learned from a customs official that about one thousand eight hundred have crossed the frontier at Julfa, but it is piobable that the number is nearer four thousand. 2. All of those expelled have arrived in a practically destitute state as comparatively few of them were able to bring much of their property rmi Rnacio Smnp r&gt;f them, however, have brought beds, gramophones, (62) Tehran, No. 12 (154/SA/38), dated the 2nd June, 1938. American Mission Hospital, only to have it confiscated by the nasmieh who paid his operation fee out of the proceeds.76 3. It is said that most of the arrivals up to date are from Kirovabad (Ganjeh) and Erivan districts and those villages nearest to the frontier and it is anticipated that a considerable number will eventually come from the Tiflis area. The rumour was doubtless brought by these refugees that all Mohammedan Russians in the Caucasus are being removed from the frontier to Siberia. 4. Those refugees who have relatives in Iran, and most of them have, are being sent to rejoin their own people so that the cost of their maintenance by the Government is reduced to a minimum and the problem of their re- absorption by the country is not likely to worry the Government unduly. 5. About two years ago, I understand, these people were given the opportunity of acquiring Soviet citizen-ship but they preferred to retain their original nationality. Consideration of conscription was doubtless a deciding factor in many cases. Now, they are not being given any option but are merely being warned to return to their country of origin. Some of them were, in fact, accorded the privilege of a police escort as far as the frontier. From this it would appear that the evacuation is not merely retaliation for loss of trade, although it may have been precipitated by the unsatisfactory commercial relations, but is rather due to the Soviet deter mination to rid the country of all foreigners who are not valuable to them as technical experts or skilled artisans. 6. My Turkish colleague informed me that many Turkish citizens are leaving via Batoum but suggested that they were leaving of their own free will. He was, however, obviously not anxious to discuss the question from the point of his own nationals and I was therefore unable to obtain further details as to number or the localities from which they were leaving.

Drivers are normally engaged on a three-year contract, during which they receive a wage of Rials 1,200—1,300 per mensem. After this they may be given a further contract at Rials 1,400—1,500. One-third of the wage is payable in rupees, the remainder in rials. In addition, they receive a free deck passage from India, free medical attendance, and allowances for rent. 3.

July 4, 1938. Letter from His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 274, dated the 22nd June 1938. I have the honour to report that on the 21 st June, during the course of my weekly interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Excellency spoke to me about the news which he had recently been receiving from Iran. u He mentioned first the rearming of the Persian army, and told me that he had reliable information that the Persians had purchased from Czechoslo vakia fifty batteries of field and fiftv batteries of mountain guns (he did not know how many guns there were to each battery). This information has caus ed some alarm to the Iraqi General Staff and had increased their desire to strengthen their own artillery without delay. 3. He went on to say that he had received a number of reports from the Iraqi consul at Tabriz which indicated that relations between Iran and Soviet Russia were becoming strained. According to these reports the trouble had started about a deal in cattle. In fulfilment of their trade agreements, the Persians had gathered for delivery to the Soviet Government large herds of cattle at some point close to the Azerbaijan frontier. There had, however been sorme hitch in settling the details of the transaction and the Persians had delayed the handing over of the herds. Thereupon Soviet troops had actually crossed the frontier and carried off the cattle from Persian territory. 4.

Clive’s des- patch No. 513 of 1927). Iranian Government who maintain that article refers only to persons in the employment of port administration have offered to accept arbitration on the point at issue but Soviet Government decline. Soviet Government made a demonstration a few days ago by sending war ships without notice into territorial waters off Pahlevi and Iranian Govern ment have protested. There the matter rests for the moment. (3) Minister for Foreign Affairs is nervous and from his frequent re ferences to good relations between His Majesty’s Government and Iranian Government I received the impression that he may have in mind to ask for good offices of His Majesty’s Government if dispute cannot be settled.

Reference :—Tehran despatch No. 227 [S. No. (60)] of the 14th June 1938. Confidential letter No. 84/14/38, of the 31st August 1938, from H. J. Seymour, to Mr. Houstoun-Bowall. Letter from British Legation, Tehran, to Hts Majesty’s Charge d’ Affaires, Bagdad, No. 84/14/38, dated the 31st August 1938. Last night I was at a dinner at wdiich the Minister for Foreign Affairs was also a guest. During the course of general conversation someone men tioned the recent press report that the Iraqi Government were buying aero planes for the Bagdad-Tehran service. A’lam then remarked that he had seen this report, but that the Iraqis had not, in his view, any right of reci procity as regards the establishment of such a service as a return for the pre sent Iranian service. His argument w^as that the Iranian service was for the purpose of connecting with the international services at Bagdad : the service to Bagdad alone was of no interest to Iran. On the basis of reciprocity the Iraqis could of course claim to run a service to Tehran to connect with an international service passing through Tehran—when there is one. 2 . I have not seen the agreement for establishing the service and do not know whether this extraordinary interpretation could be maintained on the documents. It would not be fair perhaps to take A’lam’s postprandial obiter dicta quite literally but what he said does seem to indicate that the Iranians propose to keep' this service for themselves if they can find an ex cuse. 3 . I send you the above for what it is worth, but as A’lam’s remarks were not made to me, please do not quote either of us. I have sent a copy of this letter to the Foreign Office, under cover of a despatch No. 304 of the 31st August.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, i't fiOTt-OiiV/J-Viil i J.O i lOOO. I have received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad a copy of his despatch to you, No. 274 of the 22nd June, recording remarks by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on certain affairs concerning Iran. I would venture to offer the following comments on the points therein raised. 17 (S) EAD82 2 . As regards purchases of arms from Czechoslovakia, I understand that fifty batteries of 105 mm. Skoda guns (four guns to each battery) were ordered in 1937. Thirty-eight batteries have been delivered so far, and the remain der are expected before the end of the year. I am informed that the Iranian military authorities are purchasing Hungarian draught horses to equip these batteries. 3. In the third and fourth paragraphs of his despatch Sir Maurice Peterson mentions an incident on the boundary between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Iran. I received a report of rumours of such an incident from the acting British consul at Tabriz in March last, but at the time it proved impossible to confirm them. At the time it appeared that such an incident, if it had occurred, was probably connected with the recent ex pulsions of Iranian subjects from Soviet territory, on which I had the honour to report to your Lordship in my despatch No. 221 of the 14th June. There have subsequently been reports, which again I have been unable so far to confirm, of an increase in Russian fortifications on this border. 4. As regards, in particular, paragraph 4 of Sir Maurice Peterson’s despatch, it should be noted that the 4th Division of the Iranian army (the Eastern Azerbaijan Division) is permanently stationed in that locality ; the 2 nd Division is in Tehran, and has not moved. 5. Taufiq Sirwaidi mentioned to His Majesty’s Ambassador that, accord ing to his information, the Soviet Government disliked the Saadabad Pact. In conversation with me a few days ago, the counsellor to the Soviet Embassy maintained, however, as he did last year, that his Government re garded the pact as involving some measure of “ assainissement ” in the Middle East, and therefore as something on the whole to be welcomed. 6 . It is correct that General Gendre, of the French Military Mission, who has temporarily been appointed adviser on frontier defences, has recently visited the frontier, as Taufiq Suwaidi said (please see the last sentence of paragraph 5 in Sir M. Peterson’s despatch). General Gendre has made a tour of all Iran’s frontiers, including that with India in Baluchistan ; he gave me to understand that the Azerbaijan visit was more or less of a routine na ture, enquiring laughingly whether war was expected there. 7. Mr. MacDougall, adviser to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was recently here on leave ; he left to visit Tabriz, where he was to stay with His Majesty’s consul. His intention was to proceed to Tiflis, for which journey he obtained a visa from the Soviet Embassy here. On his return to Bagdad he will no doubt bo able to give the Iraqi Government his first-hand impres sions of the situation in that locality. 8 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, No. 39.

Hedlicott of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company spoke to Baggallay the other day about the forthcoming wedding of the Crown Prince which was to take place, according to his information, some time in April of next year. He suggested that it would be a great pity if the accounts of the wedding which reached the press of this country were of a kind which cast ridicule on the pro ceedings, or dealt with them in a sensational manner. He asked accordingly whether it would be possible to say anything to the Persian Government by way ot a warning that they should take great care in giving permits to British journalists to come to Persia to report on the wedding. It would be quite all nght he said, if representatives of papers like the “ Times ” and the aily Telegraph w^ere invited ; but if all sorts of sensational newspapers or magazines also sent representatives, the results might be quite different,. e ad, he said, already heard of two or three journalists who had received invitations—I presume from the Persian Legation here.2. We feel some hesitation about taking any action on the lines which Hedlicott suggests. We feel that the Persians would either resent it as inter ference, or else feel that it entitled them to ask for our assistance, which it would be very difficult for us to give, even to the limited extent of advising confidentially in any particular case whether, in our opinion, the grant of a visa would be likely to yield unobjectionable results. Moreover we would not wish it to be put about that it was at our advice that the Persians were being obstructive about granting visas. 3. We should be interested to know whether you have any idea of what the Persians intend to do about giving visas to journalists on the occasion of the wedding, and whether you think that anything could usefully be done at your end or ours to guard against possible press “ incidents ”. It might help to avoid sensationalism if there were no “ s )ecial ” correspondents at all. (74-B) No. 165. To : The Secretary to the . Government of India in the External Affairs Depart., New Delhi. With the compliments of His Majesty’s Representative. Despatch No. 343, dated 31st October 1938, to Foreign Office* British Legation, Tehran. 31st October, 1938. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 343 (212/5/38), dated the 31st October 1938. I have the honour to report that on October 26th, the 20 th birthday of the Crown Prince, the Shah took the unprecedented step of entertaining the local Ambassadors, Ministers and their wives at a dinner at which the Queen and Princesses were present. 2 . The dinner took place in the new palace built for His Imperial Majesty, and the proceedings were, by his desire, of a very simple character. The Shah and the royal family were already in the room to receive their guests, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs being in attendance to make the necessary presentations. Evening clothes without decorations were worn. The Shah had his two daughters as neighbours, the Queen being similarly supported by her son and son-in-law. The toast of the Valiahd was proposed by the Prime Minister in a short speech which would have been more effective had the band been instructed to remain silent during its delivery. 3. After dinner there was a reception attended by members of the Iranian Government, leading generals of the Iranian army ; Charges d’Affaires and the families of heads of missions. The numbers were restricted to some seventy persons. 4. The Shah took great pains to make a success of this “ western ” party, personally seeing to the requirements of his guests for cigarettes and so forth, and taking an evident pleasure in answering questions about the rare stones and marbles which have been used in the decoration of the palace. About an hour after dinner, supper was served and the Shah, after seeing his guests gathered in the supper-room, withdrew. The Crown Prince remained and took leave of the guests as they departed. 5 . This reception, which may perhaps be regarded as an experiment, was certainly successful. It is not yet three years since Iranian women were un veiled and, though many of them are still painfully shy in general company, they have on the whole—at least in Tehran—adapted themselves remarkably well to the new social requirements. 6 . The question has been raised by the Shah’s entertainment whether the restrictions on social intercourse between Iranians and foreigners are to be modified. I do not think this is likely. His Imperial Majesty told me thatit was his wish that his daughters should in future see more of the young people of the diplomatic corps, and it is possible that social relations between the palace and the Legations, at present non-existent, may be encouraged to some extent. But I doubt whether any change in the general system is intended. I happened to meet at the races, two days after the Royal party, a Persian friend who for the last year had not been allowed to “ frequent foreigners ”, except in the Jockey Club stand, where the rules are slightly relaxed, though under the eye of the Chief of Police. This friend told me that he felt it would still be better for him to accept no invitations. This feeling is widespread, and is baded on very solid grounds.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to Foreign Office, London, No. 308, dated the 8th September 1938. The Iranian Prime Minister, in the course of a conversation which I had with his Excellency yesterday, referred to the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Geneva (which was only decided upon at the last moment), and said that one of the objects of M. A’lam’s visit would be to get into direct touch with M. Litvinov, relations between the Soviet and Iranian Governments having recently, as I have already reported, been somewhat difficult. 2. His Excellency said that the Soviet Government appeared to have persuaded themselves that the Iranian Government—who desired nothing but good for everyone—had been lending themselves to “ machinations ” against Soviet interests. Thus the Russians regarded the German civil air service, via Iran, which at present terminates at Kabul, as part of a German-Japanese plan to reduce Soviet influence in Asia. The Russians also seemed to be per suading themselves that the improvements to the port of Pahlavi which are being carried out by German engineers, may affect the position in the Cas pian, and they had made the demonstration reported in my telegram No. 97 [S. No. (71)] of the 23rd August. There were also, M. Jam said, a number of boundary questions outstanding, and no progress was being made towards their settlement. 3. It is, of course, obvious that the attitude of the Soviet Government in these matters arises from their hostility to the German commercial penetration of Iran. They are likely to go on teasing the Iranians as long as Iran’s com mercial dependence on Germany continues to increase. As the Russian market is essential to Iran, the Soviet Government are in a strong position, and, while I do not wish to belittle M. A’lam’s powers of persuasion, it may be doubted whether he will find a very responsive listener in M. Litvinov. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, ( 76 ) [Received on 26th November 1938 with Political Secretary's letter No. 45, dated 10th November 1938.)

Tevfik Riistii Aras told me yesterday that Japanese agents, diplomatic or other, had been trying to stampede both the Iranian and Afghan govern ments, employing the usual Japanese tactics of being impertinent and push- ing in order to see just to what point their provocations would be tolerated. He had therefore warned both his Iranian and his Afghan friends that the only thing when Japanese overstepped the mark was to be perfectly firm with them, as he himself had been over the Japanese Ambassadors’ conference in Istanbul. See my telegram No. 10 Saving of Agust 5th from Istanbul. He told me that his views had prevailed and that both Tehran and Kabul had taken the hint.

With reference to a letter from the Eastern Department of the 3rd May, (E 2319/235/34), regarding the visit of a small German economic delegation to Tehran, I have the honour to inform Your Lordship that a new clearing agreement between Iran and Germany is said to have been signed on the 19th October. The greatest secrecy has been observed regarding the terms of this new agreement, and no details are available at present. The Commerical Secretary to this Legation was recently informed by Herr Schliiter, the repre sentative of the Hansa Line and of other German firms, that he had called twice at the German Legation in order to obtain information about the terms of the new agreement, but had been unsuccessful. 2 . I should also add that a certain Herr Pitamayer, who is said to be a relation of Dr. Schacht, recently arrived in Tehran and is staying at the Ger man Legation. It is reported that he has been sent over to establish buying agencies throughout Iran. &amp; 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. (79) P.Z. 8117/1938. [Enclosure in Air Mail letter No. 50, dated 13th December 1938, from Secre tary, Political and Secret Department, India Office.] Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office London, No. 364 (505/47/38), dated the 15th November 1938. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of a French transla tion of a law, introduced before the Majlis and unanimously passed on the 5 th November last, to interpret Article XXXVII of the Supplement to the Fun damental Law of the Persian Empire.86 2. The original Fundamental Law, consisting of 51 articles, was promul gated on the 30th December, 1906. The Supplement of 107 articles followed on the 7th October, 1907, and the thirty-seventh article here referred to reads as follows :— “ The succession to the Throne, in case of there being more than one son, passes to the eldest son of the King whose mother is a Princess and of Persian race. In case the King should have no male issue, the eldest male of the Royal Family who is next of kin shall rank next in succession to the Throne. If, however, in the case supposed above, male heirs should subsequently be born to the King, the succession will de jure revert to such heir.” 3. This is not the first interpretation that has been decreed in connexion with the article in question. In consequence of the replacement of the Kajar by the Pahlavi dynasty, the question of the succession was dealt with in the Majlis on the 12th December, 1925, by the following modification, which was reported by Sir P. Loraine in his despatch No. 667 of the 18th December, 1925 :— “ The eldest son, if born of a Persian mother, shall be the heir apparent to the Throne. In the event of the Shah having no son, the heir to the Throne shall be designated by His Imperial Majesty, subject to the approval of the Majlis. No member of the Kajar family can, however, be so designated.” 4. The present interpretation, as need hardly be said and is indeed ex plicitly stated in the preamble to the law, is occasioned by the intended mar riage of the Crown Prince to an Egyptian Princess. In introducing the law, the Minister of Justice made a lengthy speech in which he referred, first, to the constitutional law as being a set of principles couched in general terms, which required the interpretation of the Majlis provided for by Article 27 of the Supplement to the Fundamental Law. Secondly, he described the means by which, according to the Civil Code, Iranian nationality was acquired, and drew a distinction between “ essential ” means of acquisition {e.g., being bom of an Iranian father, born on Iranian soil), which conferred an inalienable title, and “ accessory ” means {e.g. by marriage with an Iranian), which conferred only a title that might be lost as a result of such things as divorce or death of the husband. Thirdly, he said that the phrase, which appears in the translation of Article 37 in paragraph 2 above, as “ of Persian race ” and which the ‘ Journal de Teheran ’ has conveniently rendered “ Iranian d’essence ” in the enclosed extract, if it meant that the entire an cestry had to be proved Iranian, was a thing for which no one could qualify. And that the intention of the Constitution was that the mother of the future heir apparent should have, acquired her title to be an Iranian, not by the mere fact of her marriage with the ruler, but by one of the “ essential ” means en visaged by the Civil Code, previous to her marriage. Fourthly, he added that it was not considered sufficient, in the case of the future Empress, that she should acquire Iranian nationality in one of the ways open to anybody under the Civil Code, and for this reason the provision for an Imperial decree had been included in the law.

With reference to my despatch No. 300 of the 31st August, I have the ho nour to report that Monsieur Majid Ahy has been dismissed from the post of Minister of Roads and Communications, which he had held since January, 1936. An account of his career is given in Tehran Personalities Report for 1938 under No. 9. 2. The reason for Monsieur Ahy’s dismissal is not definitely known. I understand, however, that while he succeeded in carrying out work organised by his predecessor, he failed to deal satisfactorily with more important ques tions affecting the new railway lines, while the roads department of the Minis- stry has, I hear on good authority, fallen into complete confusion. As a result, it is said that Monsieur Ahy was abruptly informed by the Shah at the conclusion of a meeting of the Council of Ministers that he need not attend the next meeting. No successor has as yet been appointed, though it is ru moured that Monsieur Ali Mansur, at present Minister of Industry and Mines, (Tehran Personalities No. 122), may be transferred to the vacant Ministry, which he held from January, 1933, to January, 1936. Monsieur Ali Soheily, recently Minister in London and, for a few weeks, Minister for Foreign Affairs, is also mentioned as a possibility. 3 .

British Legation, Tehran, 13th December, 1938. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, No. 713/2/38, datHd the 13th December 1938. You may be interested to hear the following story about Muhammad Taqi Gushbeig, who was Minister of Court to the Amir of Bokhara until the arrival of the Bolsheviks. You probably know that Gushbegi, who is of Persian extraction, though a native of Bokhara, settled in Iran, first in Meshed and then in Tehran after his expulsion from Bokhara. Gushbegi recently told the Oriental Secretary that a Bokhariot, now in Tehran, had recently approached him, saying that the Japanese Minister here w’ould like to meet him. The Bokhariot indicated that the Japanese Lega tion w*ould like to get into touch with the Amir, but Gushbegi states that he declined the Minister’s invitation. This may, of course, be merely a move to try to make us interested in Gushbegi and his master, who feel rather out in the cold since they were ex pelled from Bokhara. There is, however, nothing inherently improbable in Japanese efforts to capture the Muslims of Central Asia, of whom the Amirs of Bokhara have, in the past, been among the most influential. Any such scheme would, of course, have as its object the stirring up of trouble for the Soviets. I should be very interested to learn if you have heard of any attempts to make use of the ex-Amir. I have sent a copy of this letter to Metcalfe. ( 82 ) [Enclosure in Air Mail letter No. 53, dated 30th December 1938, from Secretary, Political and Secret Department, India Office.] P. 7. 8369/38.

No. (75)] of the 8 th September, respecting the differences which had arisen between the Iranian and Soviet Governments I have the honour to report that the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs told me to-day that the misunderstandings which had caused the coolness between the two Governments had been, he thought, satisfactorily removed. His Excellency said that the Soviet Government had been suspi cious that Iran was departing from her policy of maintaining absolutely similar relations with all foreign countries, a policy which he described as one of strict neutrality but he had found Monsieur Litvinoff, in their discussions at Geneva, in a sympathetic mood, and believed he had convinced him that the Soviet suspicions had been unfounded.2 . While the disputes which took place in the summer may have been dropped, relations between Iran and the Soviet Union cannot be described as cordial. Soviet encouragement is seen, rightly or wrongly, in the case of the fifty-three persons accused of Communist activities (my despatch No. 372 of the 23rd November) and the Soviet Union is at present regarded with much suspicion.

It was interesting to hear that the Japanese Minis ter had been trying to get in touch with him. It all fits in with the information we get from time to time of Japanese attempts at intrigue along Russia’s southern borders. 2. But I don’t think the Ex-Amir of Bokhara is in the picture now. You may remember that some twelve to fifteen years ago he was a focus for intrigue in Kabul, but he has gradually faded out. He is blind, and lives very quietly in the city of Kabul. He is still carefully watched by the Afghan Intelligence Department but I rather doubt whether even the Japanese think it worth while to keep in touch with him. 3. There is another Ex-Amir here, of Khotan in Southern Sinkiang. I think the Japanese are in fairly close touch with him, and may some day try to use him to help them against the Soviet. He frequently tries to enlist our sympathy and would much like to get down to India, but the Government of India won’t have him. I think the Japs may some day try to push him across the Pamir by Wakhan, to raise his country against Soviet influence. They are certainly very interested in the southern borders of Soviet Turkestan. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe.

I gather that a number of Persians consider that the dynasty would have been in a stronger position for the future if, instead of a mere inter pretation, an entirely new Article XXXVII had been agreed to. It is felt, and probably with some reason, that at some date in the future, it may be easier for enemies of the dynasty to get the interpretation changed than for them to secure an alteration in the Fundamental Law. 3.

With the compliments of Bis Majesty's Representative. Copy of Tehran Despatch No, 419 of 30th December 1938, to Foreign Office. British Legation, Tehran, 30th December, 1938, Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 419 (210/8/38), dated the 30th December 1938. [Copies to India, No. 188, Bagdad No. 65. Paris (210/8/39).] In my telegram No. 147 of the 30th December, I reported the rupture of diplomatic relations between Iran and France. My French colleague bad, when I saw him to day, received practically no information about what had happened in Paris to cause the Iranian Government, or rather the Shah, to proceed to this precipitate action. The whole storm seems &lt;S) 61 ead ENCLOSURE FOREIGN 3EGRETA 12 to have blown up very rapidly, and Monsieur Bodard told me that all he yet knew about it was as follows. 2. On the 6 th December Monsieur Bodard had an audience with the Shah, at which His Imperial Majesty was in his most agreeable form and went out of his way to express his pleasure at his talk with the Minister.^ ^ Monsieur Bodard the same day underwent an operation, and has since then ® been confined to his bed, where in fact he still is. 3. At about the same time, it seems, certain minor French newspapers were led, on the occasion of a cat-show, to indulge in some of the usual puns on ‘chat’ and ‘Shah’, a temptation which the French press has on previous occasions been unable to resist, and which, under the present regime, causes violent resentment. Monsieur Bodard is not yet certain of the further course of events : he believes, however, that the Persian Minister in Paris was received by Monsieur Bonnet in person, but that, when the Minister asked for a second interview, it was impossible to Monsieur Bonnet owing to his other engagements, himself to receive him. The Persian Minister, Monsieur Sepahbodi, has a great sense of his own importance and Monsieur Bodard suspects that he probably made the worst of matters, and may have represented that the Shah’s representative was not being treated with due consideration. I understand also that the Iranian Government requested that proceedings might be instituted against the offending paper or papers under the recent decree law dealing with • libellous attacks on ioreign countries, but that the French Government thought it impossible to adopt this procedure in the present instance. 4. The French Minister here was, during all this, slowly recovering from his operation and received no intimation from the Ministry of Foreign Affaiis that anything was amiss. The first danger signal was the appear ance, during the last few days, of anti-French articles in the Iranian press. These were followed, on December 29th, by a note informing the Minister that diplomatic relations had been severed. Monsieur Bodard immediately te egraphed to Paris for instructions, but had not received them when I saw him today. ^ believed that the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs made some attempt to dissuade the Shah from breaking off relations, and I have no doubt they would see the undesirability of such a step. It is, however, most unlikely that they would press their objections bevond the point of safety, and it is impossible to blame them. 6 . It has long been a truism that the relations between other countries and Iran are at the mercy of journalists abroad. The present instance is an extreme example of this fact, and it must be a source of anxiety that such a grave step as the severance of relations should be decided upon with so little sense of proportion or responsibility. 7.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 21-E., dated the 26th January 1939. Copies to D. 0. T. and India (No. 11 ). I have the honour to refer to Sir Reginald Hoare’s despatch No. 357 of the 28th July, J934, in which details of railway finances up to the 20 th March, 1934 were given. Further details of funds made available for rail way construction and expenditure up to the end of Shahrivar, 1317 (22nd September 1938) were published in the vernacular in the fortnightly Journal of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce of the 7th November, 1938. 2 . From the attached translation of the figures published it will be seen that expenditure up to the 22nd September, 1938, amounted to Rials 2,127,175,767-65 which, at the official rate of Rials 80 to the £, amounts to £26,589,697. To this sum has to be added the £3,416,628 drawn from sterling reserves which brings the total up to £30,00$,325. 3. The revenue collected by means of the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax did not suffice for the Rials expenditure and loans from the Banque Mellie IraH_ and the Agricultural Bank. The loans amounted to Rial 367,708,281-85 and assistance out of Government funds amounted to Rials 422,384,951.65, these two figures representing some £9,876,165. 4. Since September last two bills for credits for the railways have been submitted to the Majlis. The first was for £500,000 for the railway and for work at Bandar Shahpour, and was voted on the 2 nd October. The second, for £300,000 for expenditure by the Railway Administration in foreign currency, was submitted to the Majlis on the 15th January, but so far as is known has not yet been voted. 5.

Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated the 13th January 1939. Despatch from British Consulate, Shiraz, to the British Legation, Tehran, No. 22 (528/S.), dated the 21st November 1938. I have the honour to report that the army in Ears appears once again to be slipping back into the unsatisfactory state revealed in its most extreme form by the Dowlatshahi scandals of 1936-37. 2. Sartip Amidi who was brought down to restore order at first showed himself to be a strict disciplinarian and purged the district of all those officers implicated in the corruption of the old system. 3. This officer, however, like so many Iranian officials, has not been able to maintain the high principles with which he began his career in Shiraz, and it is reported from reliable sources that his severity has now been mitigated by the bribes of his subordinate officers. 4. The results of this state of affairs are already appearing. The standard of food and clothing for the conscripts has fallen and there are many cases of desertion. Moreover, these continue in spite of the extreme severity with which those captured are punished; in a recent case the deserter was found dead in the barracks, apparently as the result of a beat ing, the day following his capture. 5. This state of affairs has little immediate effect on the life of the people. For them the condition of the Military Road Guards (Amnieh) is far more serious. The members of this force have always made a habit of commandeering the supplies they required from the villages near which they5 were stationed, paying nothing or only a small proportion of the price due. Of late, however, they appear to have gone further and have indulged in brigandage as outrageous as any practised by the tribes in the past. 6 . A particularly bad case was recently discovered by the Fars provi- vincial veterinary surgeon, an Austrian resident here. The story may there fore be relied upon. A band of about fifty of the Amnieh deserted their posts each of which contains two or three men under an N. C. O. and, unknown to their offi cers, descended on a nearby village. They then proceeded to pillage the unarmed inhabitants who could of course offer no resistance and to clear the village of every carpet and valuable which they could discover. 7. The case was taken up by the military, and a detachment sent out to investigate. The force does not, however, seem to have performed its duties with any great thoroughness since they reported that nothing of the stolen goods could be found. The Amnieh who by then had returned to their posts denied all knowledge of the affair and none of them seems to have been punished. 8 . Such a state of affairs explains much of the unrest reported so frequently from outlying districts and suggests that the banditry may well be only justified reprisals for injuries such as the above. So absolute however is the power of the military in the provinces that no improvement •can be expected until the situation grows serious enough to have repercus sions in Tehran. Until then the senior officers will continue to line their pockets, while villagers and conscripts suffer.

Despatch from FL M.’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 396, dated the 16th December 1938. In paragraph 13 of my despatch No. 296 of the 30th August [Enclo. to S. No. ( 1 ) in F. 143-N./38], regarding the opening of the Trans-Iranian Railway, I had the honour to report that engineers were engaged on a survey of the Tehran-Tabriz section of the proposed east-west line. 2. Early in November it was announced in the press that the experts attached to the Ministry of Roads and Communications were preparing plans for this east-west line, that it would run from Semnan to Meshed and from Tehran to Tabriz, and that work on certain sections of the line would be put in hand in the near future. About the same time the commercial secretary to His Majesty’s Legation was informed that the Consortium Kampsax hoped shortly to sign a contract for a network of railways which would include lines from Tehran to Tabriz, Tehran to Yezd and Kerman, and possibly Tehran to Meshed. 3. Negotiations continued during the month of November, but it recently became apparent that they had broken down. M. Saxild had intended to return to Denmark for a few weeks, but has now decided to remain in Tehran until a new Minister of Roads and Communications is appointed to succeed M. Majid Ahy, whose dismissal was reported in my despatch No. 390 of the 13th December, and who is now definitely understood to be in prison. That M. Saxild is not unduly optimistic can be judged by the fact that he recently told Mr. Bland (a special representative of Messrs. Lindsay, Parkinson and Company) that he would be well advised to return to London, as it was unlikely that any decision would be reached for at least six months. 8 71 ead6 4. The proposed network of new railways would probably cost between £30 and £40 million, and it is highly probable that the negotiations for their construction have broken down over the question of finance. In any case, it is unlikely that the work, except in the sections presenting little or no difficulty, will be entrusted to local contractors, since Mr. Saxild stated recently that the survey undertaken by Iranian engineers was useless and would have to be done again by competent surveyors. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 383, dated the 2nd December 1938. I have the honour to report that I was received to-day by His Imperial Majesty the Shah in order that I might hand to him personally the gift of a silver and enamel casket presented by The King. The Shah asked me to convey to His Majesty his most sincere thanks for this gift, and to assure him of the great pleasure with which he accepted this token of friendship from a ruler for whom he felt the greatest esteem. 2. After the presentation had been made the Shah kept me for some twenty minutes in further conversation. He referred first to the situation in Europe, and expressed the view that there was hope of a general improve ment. He attached much importance to the success of the French Govern ment in dealing with the general strike of the 30th November, and thought that this development was of good augury for the future. (His Imperial Majesty is always inclined to take a pessimistic view of the prospect of revolutionary elements gaining power in France.) He believed that there was now a chance for those leaders who were working for peace to get the upper hand of the elements working for disorder and war. 3. Turning to the events of last September, the Shah said that he would like the Prime Minister to know how cordially he had agreed with the policy which Mr. Chamberlain had then followed, a policy which was based upon the real interests of the British Empire and which had also brought benefits to the world. He said he wished His Majesty’s Govern ment to know also that they need have no anxiety about the policy of Iran; this policy was one of peace and of respect for the rights of other countries on a basis of equality and reciprocity. I thanked His Imperial Majesty for this message, and said that, in defining the policy of Iran, he had, I thought, accurately described that of His Majesty’s Government in the L T nited Kingdom. Peace and the possibility of development which went with peace were the desire of both countries. 4. The Shah then referred to events in Turkey. He said that he had made the acquaintance of General Inbnu during his visit to that country and had been much impressed with his character and capacity. He felt sure that under his presidency the policy of the Turkish Government would remain unchanged. In reply to an enquiry from me he said that he did not think that the change in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the drop ping of Dr. Riistii Aras foreshadowed any modification of Turkish foreign policy. ' ° 5. I was struck during this conversation with the very cordial references made by the Shah to the Prime Minister personally and to the policy of His Majesty’s Government. In his remarks on Anglo-Iranian relations reported above, he laid stress on the necessity of reciprocity WhetherHis Imperial Majesty had any special question in mind I do not know,^ and he did not give any example of what he meant. The assertion of equality and reciprocal treatment is, however, a cardinal point of Iranian policy, and it may be that the Shah took a convenient opportunity of again reminding us of it. 6 . In conclusion, the Shah again expressed his sincere appreciation of The King's gift, and his pleasure at possessing this mark of His Majesty’s friendship. I ventured to say that The King would, I knew, be happy to know that an example of English art would form an item in the fine col lection which adorns the new imperial palace. 7.

With reference to my telegram No. 11 of January 13th, I have the honour to report that no change has yet taken place in the situation result ing from the rupture of diplomatic relations between Iran and France. The Iranian Minister to France, Monsieur Sepahbodi, has arrived in Tehran after closing the Legation in Paris, and it is generally believed that his reception has been rather frigid. The French Minister and his stafl are still in Tehran. 2. Monsieur Bodard is still undergoing medical treatment and is more or less confined to his room. He told me yesterday that he was not without hope that it would be possible soon to bring the present misunderstanding to a close. There are in fact rumours that relations may be renewed before Ion 0, but such information as I have been able to obtain points rather m the^opposite direction. There is no doubt that the members of the Iranian Government would like to see normal relations restored, but their influence is small. From the point of view of the Shah the effect of the gesture of breaking off relations is somewhat marred by the fact that the French Lega tion has°remained in full strength at Tehran, and most of my colleagues feel that it would be easier to reach a settlement if the Minister had left. This I think is probably the truth. ' 3. Not only do the French Legation show no sign of leaving, but the staff has actually been increased by the arrival, a week ago, of a new mili-8 tarv attache This officer had actually left Paris before the ru P tu ^ e &gt;, bul ; was stoDoed in Bucharest. He later received orders to proceed to Tehran was stoppea in i)u difficultv The French Minister had not been and arrived i gather that the Iranian Ministry „ tto MiliU^ Attache’s unexpected ^ dppearanee.^^^ incident hag added to the troubles of the French Legation d comm u n itv here. When the former French Military Attach^ lelt some weeksTgo he transferred his stock of wines, etc., to the house of a Monsieur Mathis 8 the local representative of Messrs. Schneiders and other French firms ’This was of course observed by the police and Monsieur Mathis was arrested A search of his house disclosed some sporting weapons for which Monsieur Mathis had no licence. The French Minister tells me that Monsieur Mathis has not asked for any assistance from the ^tmn and that the police examination of his papers gave no evidence of any activi ties which could possibly be considered ‘political’. The matter is thus, in Monsieur Bodard’s view, merely one of certain minor ‘'egulantiesot which Monsieur Mathis had unfortunately been gui 7- . S ... • been proceeding for some days between the police authorities and Monsieur Mathis’ representatives as to the amount of the fine which Monsieur Mathis should pay, and the French Minister expects his release in the near future The. incident has aroused a good deal of feeling among the French community here, and it must be admitted that it forms a bad precedent for the treat- ment of foreigners in future. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary G . ov fT“ ment of India in the External Affairs Department and to His Majesty s Ambassadors at Baghdad and Paris. p s —Since I wrote this despatch the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the course of a conversation which I had with him on the 11th .February- observed that he had some hopes that a settlement of the trouble with France might be reached before April, as it would be a V'ty thm ^ would ment were not represented on such an occasion. . i c|| indeed be a matter for regret: the relations, especially in the cult ' ra ’’ between Iran and France had been so close and so long maintained that it ought to be possible to compose the present difficulty.

Breach of relations was thus decided upon with no previous discussion. 3. Articles which gave offence were simply on account of cat-show and Shah was not even mentioned. This has been explained to Iranian Gov ernment in a message from French Minister for Foreign Affairs containing most cordial references to Iran and Shah personally but further note from Iranian Government dated January 5th merely maintains previous point of view. 4. French thinks Ministers here have not dared mention matter again to the Shah and is trying to find some channel through which French expla nations may be brought to His Majesty’s notice.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 80-E., dated the 16th March 1939. Copy to D. O. T. India No. 39. With reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 93-E. of the 9th March, 1938 TS. No. (27) in F. 7-N./38], I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith extracts from the ‘Journal de Tehran' giving details and estimates of the budget for the Iranian year 1318 (22nd March, 1939 to- the 21st March, 1940), which was approved by the Majlis on the 5th March. 2. For the first time since 1928-29 a deficit is revealed, which is larger than the total expenditure in 1928-29. Estimates of expenditure in the coming year, apart from credits from state reserves in sterling, amount of Rials 2,613,481,987 (£32,668,525 at the official rate of Rials 80 to the £) and Revenue is estimated at Rials 1,930,096.700 (£24,126,210), leaving a deficit of Rials 683,385,287 (£8,542,316). 3. On the Revenue side, it will be noted that receipts from the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax, as well as the Road Tax, are now included in the ordinary budget, increasing the revenue from Customs and from Monopolies. 4. Comparative lists of the chief sources of revenue and of the chief headings of expenditure herewith transmitted show the increases over the figures of the previous budget. Attention may be drawn to the estimated increase in indirect taxation, though direct taxation remains at the same figure. Estimated revenue from Industries is increased by Rials 20,000.000 from the tar and sleeper factory, Rials 10 , 000,000 from ‘Factory No. S' which is thought to be the gas mask factory, and Rials 10,000,000 from the glycerine and soap factory.13 /fo 5. On the expenditure side, the outstanding increase is for Roads and Communications, the new estimates amounting to Rials 853,550,000 (£10,669,376) or about 33 per cent, of the total expenditure. A sum of Rials 150,000,000 (£1,875,000) for the Administration of Mines and for iron and brass foundries brings the estimates for the Ministry of Industry and Mines to Rials 455,430,000 (£5,693,000) or about 17 per cent, of the total. Rials 60,000,000 have been added to the estimates for the Ministry of War, bringing the total up to Rials 415,408,380 (£5,192,600) representing about 16 per cent, of the total expenditure : to this may be added the credit out of reserves of £ 2 , 000 , 000 . 6 . To meet the declared deficit, it is stated that Rials 140,000,000 will be available from the sale of the cotton mill at Behshahr (late Ashraf), which it is understood, has been purchased by the Shah, payment to be made by instalments. A further sum of Rials 160,000,000 “en devises etrangeres” is to help to diminish the deficit; it would appear that half of this sum (or £ 1 , 000 , 000 ) is to come out of reserves—out of which £ 2 , 000,000 has already been earmarked for the Ministry of War and £1,000,000 for the railway and ports. The other half is to be raised by long term credits. The rest of the deficit is to be covered by unforeseen receipts, revenue from commercial enterprises of the State and by borrowings from banks in the country. I have heard of the possibility of an increase in income-tax on large profits, that is to say that the present rate of 4 per cent, on such profits may be raised considerably. 7. A copy of the bill for the Supplementary Law to the budget, publish ed on the 9th March, is also furnished herewith. 8 . A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department and to the Department of Overseas Trade. Enclosure II to S. No. ( 10 ).

J’ai Thonneur d’attirer 1’attention de la Chambre sur les points suivants: ( 1 ) Conformement a I’Article IX de la loi sur le Monopole d’Etat du sucre et du the votee le 9 Khordad 1304 (31 juillet 1925), les recettes prove- nant de ce Monopole doivent etre affectees aux voies ferrees; de meme, eon- lormement a I’Article VI de la Loi modifiant la taxe de route votee le 8 chahrivar 1311 (30 aout 1932) le produit de cette taxe doit etre affecte a la construction et a 1 ’entretien du reseau routier, deduction faite des subven tions faites a 1 Education Nationale, 1 Hygiene Publique, aux oeuvres de bienfaisance et aux municipalites. Les recettes prevues par ces lois devaient etre portees a un eompte special et senent exclusivement aux depenses des voies ferrees et des routes. Au cours de ces dernieres annees les frais des constructions massives de chemins de fer et de routes n’ont pu etre couverts par ces sources; il a fallu cbaque annee inscrire au budget general des credits importants, comme en (S) 61 EAD23 |[^) (H) [Enclosure in Air Mail letter No. 13, dated 24th March 1939, from Secre tary, Political and Secret Department, India Office.] Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 22nd March 1939. ^Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 39 (259/2/39), dated the 10th February 1939. I have the honour to report that Monsieur Ali Soheily, formerly Iranian Minister in London, who was dismissed from the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs in July last, has been appointed Governor-General of Kerman. Details of his career will be found under No. 200 in my 1938 Personalities Report. 2. In view of the important posts which he has held in the past, Monsieur Soheily’s appointment to the Governorship of the impoverished province of Kerman indicates that he has not yet returned to full favour with the Shah. He has however very small private resources and will, I have no doubt, be glad to put his foot onto the official ladder again. 3. Of other Minister who fell into disfavour last year it may be worth mentioning that Monsieur Hikmat, who was well known to His Majesty’s Legation during his tenure of the post of Minister of Education, has I hear returned to Tehran and there are reports that he may be re-employed before long. Monsieur Hussein Ala, who will be well remembered as an active representative of the Iranian Government in London, still remains under a cloud.

I have the honour to report that Monsieur Ibrahim Alam has been appointed Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Monsieur Alam, who was formerly known as Muhammad Ibrahim Shaukat (Shaukat-ul-Mulk) C.I.E., was formerly Governor General of the Province of Ears. An account of his career will be found in my 1938 Personalities Report under No. 195, where the name should have been given as Alam, not A’lam. 2. The last Minister of Posts and Telegraphs was Monsieur Nizam-ud- Din Hikmat, who died in January, 1937. No successor to Monsieur Hikmat was appointed, and the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs has been in the hands of acting Ministers, of whom Monsieur Mohamed Hakimi was the most recent.

Enclosure II to S. No. (12). THE ANNUAL MILITARY REVIEW. The Annual Military Review took place at the Race-course at Jalalieh on the 22nd February, the anniversary of the Coup d’Etat of 1921. The Ministry of War had issued invitations to the whole of the Dip lomatic Corps as well as to over 2,000 other guests. Accommodation in the three large public stands was therefore totally inadequate for the numbers invited. All the foreign military attaches including the new French military attach^ (Commandant Alessandri) were present. The police arrangements for traffic control on the roads leading to Jalalieh were distinctly poor and no attempt was made to organize traffic lanes. Car parking arrangements were also inadequate. All cars and carriages were parked in rows in a car park with only one exit. As the general public were allowed to use this exit and walk through the car park the confusion was indescribable. The weather was fine though bitterly cold. The parade was drawn up on the North side of the race-course in mass in an “L” shaped formation. The total number of trocps and youth organizations on parade was approximately 35,000. A Royal Guard of Honour of one squadron was furnished by the' 1 st (Pahlevi) Lancers and was mounted outside the Royal Pavilion. The parade was announced to commence at 13-30 hours. Their Royal Highnesses Princes Shahpur Ali Reza, Ghulam Reza, Ahmad Reza, Mahmud Reza and Hamid Reza, dressed in khaki uniform of the Tehran Military School arrived at 13-35 hours. They were shortly followed by His Royal Highness Shahpur Muhammad Reza Pahlevi the Crown Prince. The latter was dressed in the uniform of a Lieutenant of the General Staff. Prior to the arrival of the Shah the younger Princes posed for press photo graphers. His Imperial Majesty the Shah arrived at 14-05 hours attired in his usual khaki uniform but wearing a greatcoat. On alighting from his car the National Anthem was played. His Majesty gazed slowly round the bowmg Cabinet Ministers and saluting officers and then beckoned for his charger. He immediately mounted and accompanied by His Royal High ness the Crown Prince and a staff of six rode along the front rank of the parade. The assembled troops cheered His Majesty loudly as he passed each unit. The Shah then ordered Sarlashgar (Major-General) Hadi Shaqaqi (Hisn-ud-Dowleh), Inspector of Cavalry, and in command of the parade to order arms and begin the march past. General Shaqaqi galloped off but was nearly unseated by his excited charger and only good horsemanship saved the day.25 l\b The Shah returning direct to the Royal Pavilion dismounted and dis appeared within. At 14-26 hours seventy-five aeroplanes flew over from South to North in flights of five. The machines were as follows : — De Havilland “Tiger-Moth”—25. Hawker “Audax”—25. Hawker “Hind”—15. Hawker “Fury”— 10 . Formations varied. The normal distance of two wing lengths was not adopted by all flights. Most of the aircraft flew past at a height of between 800—1,000 feet with the exception of the “Hinds” which were nearer 1,500 feet. During the fly past His Majesty emerged on the verandah of the Royal Pavilion, glanced upwards and again retired into the verandah door way where he remained the whole afternoon invisible to the general public and only just visible to the formations marching past. The march past which lasted for 3f hours then commenced in the following order: — 1. Youth Organizations — (i) Girl Guides—50 troops of an average strength of 25. (ii) Boy Scouts —110 troops of an average strength of 30. (iii) Boy Scout Cyclists—280. (iv) Students from the University, Technical Schools and Colleges in alphabetical order—80 platoons of an average strength of 2.

Injantry^Officers .—All officers were dismounted. Many junior officers were observed in command of companies, and warrant officers in charge of platoons. The machine gun, close support and anti-tank units were however fully officered. A large proportion of junior officers wore glasses. Regimental Colours. —Each regiment carried its colours at its head. The colour party consisting of the colour bearer (an N. C. O.) and two officers on his right and lelt. No colour belt with socket is carried which makes it difficult for the colour to be borne upright. All colours were of silk but varied in design and colour. Each battalion had a square silk pennon carried by the right guide of the leading company. A rmaments —- The second and fifth sections of each platoon were the light automatic sections. The light automatic (Brno) was carried at the slope by the No. 1 . There were 54 light automatics per regiment. Following each battalion was one machine gun company on pack consisting of six guns. Following each regiment were: — (i) One anti-tank gun platoon of six guns mounted on rubber tyred wheels and drawn by a single mule between light shafts. Following each gun was its ammunition limber also drawn by a single mule. Details of this gun are unknown. (ii) One close support platoon of four Stokes Brandt (81 mm) Mortars on pack. (iii) One signal platoon equipped with field telephones, cable, lamps and helios. Dress— The Infantry wore greatcoats with squared packs round which a neatly rolled blanket was fastened. Copper mess tins, water bottles (wide neck and uncovered) and entrenching tools were carried. Boots again showed up as a weak point. They are made of rough untanned leather and are not polished with the exception of one battalion which had endeavoured to be so but with indifferent results. in some platoons a new issue of peaked caps had been made for the review. These were of an unpleasing mustard colour. Generally, however, the turn out of the men was good and their equip ment seemed to be new and cared for although not up to British standards. The men looked clean and healthy. Most of them being of the peasant and tribesmen class. Drill and Marching. —No arms drill was visible from the stands. Rifles with fixed bayonets were carried almost perpendicular. This makes the slope appear regular, and even though it must be a severe strain on the arm. The dressing was good. The marching good, except that the step on passing the saluting base was a mixture of a slow march and a goose step. The foot is brought up with the knee bent and is then stamped on the ground well in advance of the body thus causing considerable jar to the body. Pack Mules. —All animals looked fit and in good condition. All were unclipped and in many cases showed traces of rubbing, a sign of badly fitting saddlery. Leather work .—The leather work of the anti-tank and close support platoons was new. The remainder looked serviceable but was unpolished and not up to British standards. 4. Cavalry—Horses — Officers’ chargers were on the whole well bred and turned out. They were mostly Turcomans, with some Arabs, The troop horses were unimpres sive but are probably better than they look. The matching of the horses was very good, each troop having horses of one colour only. The bays were mostly the hardy Kurd ponies, with a sprinkling of Turcomans.~4 28 .There were also troops mounted on local bred chest-nuts and blacks. The greys were a mixture of Arab and locally bred ponies. The greys were indifferently turned out, many showing stable stains which are evidence of faulty grooming. No attempt appears to be made either to pull or trim tails. The troop horses are never clipped during the winter. This may be sound from the practical point of view but when they are badly groomed they look untidy. Heels had not been trimmed and there was no evidence of feet having been properly gone over with hoof oil before parade. Equipment .—Saddlery still varies in type. Bridles and bits similarly varied from light single bridles with a snaffle to heavy head stalls with double bridles and universal bits. It was noticed that the sabre scabbard is carried on the off-side. Horsemanship .—The standard of riding was good. Dressing was only fair. The rear ranks in particular were inclined to let their horses almost tread on the heels of the front rank. 5. Engineers .—See remarks for Infantry. 6 . Independent Mechanized Brigade — This was very smartly turned out indeed. All vehicles had been newly painted. It was noticed that after passing point “B” all the covers over the drivers heads on the tanks were opened to allow of free air circulation. All the personnel wore black leatherjackets and semi-crash helmets. The No. 1 gunner in each A. F. V. stood up in the turret and saluted when passing the saluting base. Two wireless cars and one light workshop car were included. No. P. 0. L. lorries were driven past. 7. Artillery — Gun carriages and limbers .—These had all been newly painted and were spotless. Gun breeches had been removed in all cases. Battery protection—AW gunners and drivers carried a slung carbine. No light automatics were observed. Draught horses. The Field Artillery were drawn by the heavy Hungarian horses imported within recent years. The animals were in good condition. The fact that they were unclipped gave one the impression of slovenliness in grooming and care which perhaps is not the case. Drivers .—Besides riding their own horses they also held in their right hand reins for the off-siders. This appeared to be most uncomfortable both tor the horse and the drivers themselves. No guiding whips were carried. Officers. Officers were well mounted. Many junior officers commanded batteries. There is still an obvious paucity of officers in this arm. 8 . Bands — Besides the Boy Scout band, the following bands plaved during the march past of their respective units :— Band of the 1 st Infantry Division. Band of the 2 nd Infantry Division. Cavalry Mounted Band. Am whe f &lt; ; d bef 1 ore caching Point “A” and drew up in three line 9 opposite the saluting base. No counter inarching was attempted. Each Fl?i Wa T, COmpOSed of t br ^instruments ( Trum pets, Bugles, Drums and wl f The average strength was about 30. The march time maintained . r indeed. The turn out of the bands was indifferent. None ot the brass instruments were polished. The tunes played was evidently an adaption from French and Russian military music.29 9. Summary — r None of the foreign military attaches had ever before attended this review. The general opinion among them however was that the parade was well carried out and impressive. Foreign diplomats and others with military experience were of the opinion that the turn out and march past showed a considerable improvement on that of last year. It was noticed that as soon as the troops had passed the saluting base march discipline fell away badly. Many officers were permitted to fall out as soon as regiments had got into column of route for the march back to barracks. No attempt was made to keep the men in step or take pride in themselves or their regiment when passing through the crowded streets. The big feature of this parade was the march past of the girl guides, boy scouts and student organizations. These youngsters after waiting in a bitterly cold wind for hours without greatcoats marched past in a most creditable manner. When it is considered that these organizations only started two years ago the progress achieved is remarkable and speaks well for the future. (13) No. 32.

JS) 61 EADa violent press campaign at Tehran against France. The French Minister at Tehran has been instructed to make to the Iranian authorities the necessary explanations to dispel the misunderstanding which the publication of these articles seems to have created in Court circles. None, the less, the Iranian Government decided on the 28th December to break of! diplomatic relations with the French Government.” 2. The Temps (Right) adds that the official notification of the rupture of diplomatic relations was conveyed to M. Bonnet in a note addressed to him on the 30th December, on behalf of the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, by the Iranian Minister at Paris. It recalls that an incident of the same nature led to the refusal of Iran to participate in the Paris Exhibition of 1937. 3. The Petit Parisien (Centre) of the 31st December states that the article in question contained no reference whatever to the Shah, but was merely headed “Quand Sa Majeste le Chat Recoit.” A copy of a cutting from the Petit Parisien reproducing the heading in question is attached.

With reference to my despatch No. 43 of the 11 th February, I have the honour to report that Monsieur Ali Asghar Hikmat has been appointed Minister of the Interior. In my despatch No. 300 of the 31st August last [S. No. (70) in F. 7-N./38], I had the honour to report that Monsieur Abul Qasim Ferouhar had been appointed to this post. No announcement regarding Monsieur Ferouhar’s removal from office has as yet been made. 2. Monsieur Hikmat, an account of whose career will be found under No. 99 in my 1938 Personalities Report, was Minister of Education until his sudden and unexpected dismissal reported in Mr. Butler’s telegram No. 88 of the 15th July last [S. No. (65) in F. 7-N./38]. His record in the Ministry of Education was a good one, and his return to favour is encouraging..3. I happened to meet Monsieur Hikmat yesterday and took the opportunity of congratulating him and asking how he expected to like his new duties. Monsieur Hikmat said that education was his real bent and that no other work could be so satisfactory to him. He hoped, however, to find a useful sphere of activity in the department of public health, of which, as Minister of the Interior, he is the head. Monsieur Hikmat’s work at the Ministry of Education has shown that he has considerable energy and driving power, and if he is given a chance he should be able to accom plish valuable work in his new Ministry. In the domain of public health he will at any rate, except in the large towns, be starting more or less from scratch. 4.

The Commercial Secretary had a conversation on the 16th February with the Iranian Ambassador on the subject of the new Commercial Treaty between Iran and the Soviet Union. The Ambassador said that the Delegation from Tehran had already arrived in Moscow and had had two interviews with M. Mikoyan, the People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade. The previous treaty was signed in 1935 for a period of three years which lapsed in June last. It was not renewed because the Soviet Union wished to alter the basis of the agreement which provided for an exact balance of trade between the two countries. The Soviet Union wanted a more elastic arrangement. The Ambassador did not know how long the delegation would remain in Moscow; that would depend upon circumstances. He explained that the function of the Delegation was simply to prepare the ground for the conclusion of a new treaty. Such a treaty if and when concluded would be signed at Tehran and not at Moscow.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 110-(379/3/39), dated the 14th April, 1939. Copy to India, No. 47, In the course of conversation today with the Minister for Iorei. 0 n Affairs, 1 tried to ascertain what view the Iranian Government were taking of the situation in Europe, especially in view of the Italian occupation o Albania. 2. From what His Excellency said I have no doubt that this latest example of power politics has come as a severe shock to the Iranian Gov em inent. He observed that Albania was after all an independent ^^ate, existing in virtue of international agreements and that, while it might ha\e been in practice under Italian control, its occupation was a complete breach of treaty undertakings. He continued by saying that all Internationa security must rest upon the observance of treaty obligations and that there could be no confidence anywhere, so long as certain powers were able to take forcible action in defiance of their own promises. The guarantee which the Italian Government are reputed to have given to Greece he regarded as worthless. He expressed much dislike of the talk of the reconstitution of the Holy Roman Empire, or of the Roman Empire, and wondered whether it was hoped to include Asia Minor in some such reconstituted State. He finished by again lament ing that confidence and security were impossible in any part of the world so long as these adventures continued. 3. Monsieur A’lam, in short, seems to realise fairly clearly that the present policy of the Axis Powers is a danger not only to Europe but. to the Near and Middle East. His views are of course of small weight even in his own country and I have little doubt that he refrains from expressing them, for what they are worth, to either the German or the Italian Minister here.’ There has, as usual, been no independent comment in the Tehran press on events in Albania. 4 . The Minister also referred again to the commercial relations between Iran and Czeeho-slovak firms, more or less on the same lines as reported in my despatch No. 87 of the 28th March. He added, however, that deliveries of goods ordered in Czechoslovakia before the German entry were being made and seemed to imply that business with former Czecho-slovak firms would continue on the same lines as before, There are, however, some signs that the Iranian Government are thinking of the possibility of becoming less dependent on Germany, if means can be found of paying for goods from alternative sources of supply. 5 . A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department.

I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of an interestino- despatch from His Majesty s Consul at Ahwaz regarding the recent visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to Khuzistan. regard to paragraph 9 of Mr. Gardener’s despatch if a alace is built for the Shah on the site proposed it seems unlikely that His opposite LnkTfThTriver t0 COnStrUCt a C ° nsulate on the Ahwaz A C ° Py ° f thiS deSPatCh ‘ S bemg sent t0 His Majesty’s Consul at Enclosure to S. No. ( 20 ). Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz. to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 4, dated the 23rd March, 1939. I have the honour tc report that His Imperial Majesty the Shah accompanied by Qawam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz; Aqa Sami’ee, Head of the Koyal Court; Aqa Shokuh-ul-Mulk, Head of the Royal Cabinet; and Aqa C^a em-Maqam-ul-Mulk, left Tehran on the 6 th instant to pay his lomr expected visit to Khuzistan. The preparations made for His Imperial Majesty s arrival and the state of excitement which reigned here before and during the visit are constant features of such occasions and are there fore not worth describing. I therefore propose to relate only the special features of His Majesty’s visit. 1 2 . Actually, the visit started in rather unfortunate circumstances, n about the 4th March, a violent rainstorm damaged the railwav line and blocked the motor road between Belarud and Mazu. Repairs were started butafurthBr storm did still more, damage with the result that for some time t looked as if His Imperial Majesty’s train would not be able to pass A thk d nroSf 100 Wa fi S ln , ade t0 the Shah that he should Postpone his visit but this pioposal was firmly rejected. 3. However hundreds of coolies were drafted into the. area and thanks Aaa MusheCfh ° n th u f rf ° f the railwa y engineers headed bv A&lt; P Musher, the newly promoted head of the Railways the track had been sufficiently repaired to permit the royal train to pass on the 7 th instant at Ahw.fCT m l day the ? th instant His Imperial Majesty arrived see^s He waT K . 6 S n S 10n “C a PP roach roads w ore crowded with sight seers He was obliged to make an undignified exit from the train as the military band struck up the Iranian anthem too soon. on foot^thfnTT’i ? 18 Ma i est y decided t0 make a detailed inspection “heoourse of his JalCn 'f’ Ti’ ° n t he right bank of the Ka ™n.

Mr. 3 WI lln Slx months this work, which the Company hadin any case proposed to do, would be completed. Mr. Pattinson said the Shah seemed quite friendly. He added tnat he was very pleased that he had been present as he had thus learnt for himself the Shah’s wishes instead of receiving a garbled version of them. 6 . Leaving the depot, His Majesty turned to go out by an unfrequented path. Mr. Pattinson warned him that the chosen path was rough but His Majesty persisted. Within a few yards there was a steep grassy bank and on this the Shah’s foot slipped and he fell heavily. Mr. Pattinson and others rushed forward to assist the royal visitor but before they could get there, His Majesty had regained his feet exclaiming “It is nothing”. He turned to Mr. Pattinson and showed him the sole of his shoe (which was of the soft heelless variety) to explain the cause of his fall. 7. His Majesty continued his tour of inspection and next visited the experimental garden kept by the Agricultural Department. Here he dis played great interest in the trees and flowers, asking which varieties thrived best here. After visiting other parts, His Majesty returned to the railway bungalow set aside for his use having walked for a total of three hours. 8 . The next day he was expected to visit the town of Ahwaz in the morning and attend a military parade in the afternoon but His Majesty did not leave his quarters during the whole day. It later became known that as a result of his fall on the previous day, His Majesty had damaged his right hand which had swollen. Military doctors were called on to attend him. The Governor-General was received in audience for one hour during which time he received orders to set aside a piece of land on the right bank for the construction of a palace. The Governor-General appears to have taken advantage of this interview to explain that the scheme ordered from Tehran for the repair and draining of the streets of Ahwaz had made little progress as financial sanction had been received only when Aqa Furuhar, then Minister of the Interior had visited Ahwaz on 9th February. 9. On the morning of the 10th His Majesty accompanied by the Governor-General paid another brief visit to the river bank and selected another site (in lieu of the one first chosen) for the construction of his palace. He said he would send engineers to Ahwaz to start the work immediately on his return. The final site chosen is immediately opposite the site of the proposed Consulate. The Shah also ordered the construction of boulevards on each bank of the river. 10 . In the afternoon, he went to the military parade. Realising that the troops had been awaiting his arrival since the morning he dismissed the parade after a march past. Irom the parade, ground he returned to the barracks and there inspected the bathrooms, arsenal, anti-craft park and the aerodrome. He spent an hour in the military hospital. He constantly praised the work General Mu’ini had done here. 11 . That evening, the Shah told General Shahbakhti, the new General Officer Commanding, in the presence of the Ustandar, to supervise the civil activities of the Province in the same way as General Mu’ini did. General Shahbakhti has since sent two letters to the Municipality one to state that no money must be spent without his consent and the other ordering the purchase of a motor watering sprayer for the streets. 12 . On the morning of the 11 th, His Imperial Majesty left for Bandar Shahpur. According to all accounts, this port had been completely cleaned up for the visit and the signs of chaos covered up. An Iranian sloop sent around from Khorramshahr fired a salute of twenty-one guns when the Shah appeared on the jetty. As a proof of his interest in &amp; the port and also as a tribute to his sources of information, I might mention that His Majesty astounded everyone by enquiring if the hammer which had been lost from the jetty about a fortnight before had been recovered. When (S) 61 EAD46 tlio contractor replied that it had not but that a new one had been substitut ed he ordered that the old one should be recovered by the divei who was working at the jetty. He also ordered that the barge recently sunk should also he &amp; salved. It is of course impossible to say whether His Majesty really remembered these details (compare also his “recognitiom’ of Mr. Pattinson) or whether he is primed by the Durbar. Whichever it may be, the officials and others concerned are certainly impressed. 13. That same night His Majesty returned to Ahwaz and ordered his train for 7 a.m. the next morning. Leaving here punctually His Majesty arrived back in Tehran at 10-30 a.m. on the 13th. ( 21 ) No. 70. To the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, Simla.

In paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 36 of February 8 th [Enclosure to S. No. ( 8 )], 1 referred to the arrest of Monsieur Mathis, the local represent ative in this country of various French firms. 2 . Monsieur Mathis wms kept in prison, without any definite accusa tion being made against him, until the Wedding celebrations in April. General Weygand then mentioned the case to the Shah with the result that the proceedings wrere dropped and Monsieur Mathis was released. The whole procedure seems to indicate clearly that the Iranian Government do not regard the safeguards of 1928 as having any validity. No French nationals were allowed access to Monsieur Mathis in prison, he was not allowmd to be released on bail and, as already stated, no definite accusation was made against him. I understand from the Secretary to the French Legation that Monsieur Mathis seems to have been suspect ever since a visit which he paid to the Caspian coast nearly two years ago in the company of the Czech Charge d Affaires, the French Military Attache and some Persian friends. One at least of the. Persians was immediately imprisoned for a time as a result of this apparently harmless excursion and it would seem that the other members of the party have been regarded with suspicion ever since. r 3. I should perhaps add that Monsieur Mathis says that he was well treated by the authorities while in prison. The whole affair is, however, an extremely bad precedent for foreigners living in this country. 4.

A transport company founded by Sherkat Bimeh Iran with a capital of Rials 1,000,000 divided into shares of Rials 1,000 of which 30 shares are held by Sherkat Bimeh Iran and the remaining shares have been subscribed to by the public. The object of the Company is to undertake transports. The Company is supported by the Ministry of Finance, who have appointed Aghai Mehdi Nemazi as Chairman.. One-third of the capital has been paid up. 21-6-39. 2. It will be observed that the Insurance Company Tran’ founded this new International Transport Company, with the support of the Ministry of Finance. No further information is as yet available as to the activities of the Company. It is, however, difficult to believe that a mono poly of import and export shipping could be contemplated in present circumstances, even if the three steamers required by the Iranian Govern ment vrere to materialise in the near future. 3 .

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 336-(532/8/39), dated the 18th October, 1939. With reference to my despatch No. 305 of the 20th September, enclos ing copies of a memorandum on the Persian Press, I have the honour to report that as from the 15th October all news reaching the Agence Pars must first be submitted to the police, who censor it, and then hand it over to the Censorship Department, whence it is sent to the newspapers. 2. It is not known why the police authorities should wish to censor news before it reaches the Censorship Department, and it is alleged that the press is as yet ignorant of this new practice. There appear to be two possible explanations. Firstly, as is general in oriental countries where Government is despotic and the masses are illiterate, an undercurrent of rumour and suspicion is chronic and inevitably increases in wartime; and52 it is the police on whom the Shah primarily relies for observation of this undercurrent. Secondly, since the police are thus enabled to .control both the published and unpublished news which reaches the Shah, they probably wish to impose their control at as early a stage as possible and thereby increase their power and influence with the Shah. As pointed out in the ^ final paragraph of the memorandum enclosed in my despatch No. 305 under reference, the police have in the past summarized the press and submitted these summaries to the Shah; this censorship of all news by the police is, however, a new development. 3. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Ministry of Information, the Middle East Intelligence Centre and the Government of India.

Tehran despatch No. 346 of 29th October, 1939. British Legation, Tehran, 29th October, 1939. Enclosure to S. No. '(31). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 346-(379/ll/39), dated the 29th October, 1939. There is little of interest to report about the attitude of the Iranian Government towards the war. From the Iranian point of view the policy of Russia is for the moment the one thing that matters, and I feel reason ably sure that the Soviet Government have not yet given any definite indica tion of their intentions or whether their policy towards this country is to be modified. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs in conversation yesterday asked me whether 1 had any news I could give him about probable Russian moves in Asia. I said that I had not and suggested that so far the Russians seemed to be mainly concerned with re-establishing their influetice in the European areas which had been Russian before 1918, and with strengthen ing their position in respect of Germany. I added that I had noticed the references to Russia in the Shah’s speech from the throne at the opening of the Majliss [my telegram No. 166 of 28th October, S. No. (29)], and asked what significance was to be attached to them. His Excellency replied that the Irano-Soviet Commercial agreement had expired over a year ago, and that the Shah had simply referred to it because the negotiations for a new one had hung fire for so long. In referring to the various rumours of Russian intentions which have circulated in Tehran he said that there were no serious concentrations of Russian forces near the Iranian frontiers:) there had been various troop movements, but these seemed to be mostly in the nature of transfers of troops between European and Asiatic Russia. 3. There is no doubt that anxiety as to Russian intentions persists, and naturally so. The Iranian Government fear that the longer the war lasts the greater will be the opportunities for Russia to follow unchecked any policy in regard to her weaker neighbours which may appeal to the Kremlin.53 4. On the other hand I am inclined to think that those who represent the Shah’s views see that Hitler’s “peace offer’’ afforded no basis for negotiation. Monsieur Jam (then Prime Minister, now Minister of the Court) told me, after the speech that he thought it the speech of a madman. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is rather fond of speculating in general terms, has spoken to me of what Hitler’s position might now be if he had kept the undertaking given at Munich to settle future questions by peaceful means. If he had done so, Monsieur A’lam said, he would almost certainly have obtained all that Germany needed, and would now be one of the most popular figures in the world. These remarks are, I am aware, of no particular intrinsic interest: but both Monsieur Jam and Monsieur A’lam are, or were, fairly close to the Shah and one may suppose that their views as to Hitler’s responsibility for the war reflect those of His Majesty. 5. The commercial and financial situation of Iran naturally remains difficult. There is now a tendency to turn to the United States for supplies, and enquiries are being made there, for among other things, rails, tyres, aeroplanes, and a loan. I am told that the Iranian Government are becom ing suspicious of German assurances that they will be able to continue supplies of machinery and other industrial material on a practically un diminished scale. 6.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 342 (768/3/39), dated the 31st October 1939. With reference to my telegram No. 158 of 19th October [S. No. (25)], I have the honour to report that my Japanese colleague informs me that the treaty signed on 18th October between Japan and Iran consists merely of four articles, providing for friendship between the two States, and diplomatic and consular relations. It does no more, the Minister'said than provide for what already exists, 2. Mr. Nakayama also told me that negotiations for a commercial' treaty had not begun. He said that such a treaty had actually been signed some eight years ago (this is presumably the treaty of 18th October f932) but had never been ratified, or submitted to the Majliss for approval, bn his arrival here in 1937 he had taken up the matter but had been told that (S) 61 EAD54 the treaty could not now be resurrected, as the five years for which it had been concluded had already expired. On the Japanese side too there was some difficulty, the nature of which was not quite clear to me, but it was to the effect that, the original treaty having been submitted to the Emperor of Japan for approval, it would not have been proper to submit the same treaty to him again. In any case, the upshot has been a short treaty on the lines above described. 3. On the general question of Irano-Japanese trade the Minister was rather pessimistic : he said that Japan bought here in order to sell in the Iranian markets : Iranian goods were not however much liked in Japan. In the case, for instance, of both cotton and wool a better quality could be bought in other countries at a lower price. 4.

The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi, With the compliments o His Majesty's Representative. Copy of despatch No. 345 (252/9/39) of 31st October 1939. From His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. To the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London. British Legation, Tehran, 31st October 1939. Enclosure to S. No. (33). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 345 (252/9/39), dated the 31st October 1939. As reported in my telegram Iso. 165 of October 28th, it was announced after the meeting of the new Majliss on October 26th that Mr. Jam, the Prime Minister, had been appointed Minister of the Court, and was to be succeeded by Dr. Matin Daftary, the Minister of Justice. It has since been announced that M. Bader, the Minister of Finance, has been replaced by General Amir Khosrovi, the President of the National Bank. No statement has been made as regards any future employment for M. Bader, who disappears from the Government. The remaining Ministers are, I am informed, to continue in their present posts. 2. The main interest of this re-shuffle is thus the elimination of M Bader, who has generally been regarded as the most pro-German element m the late Cabinet. As I have previously reported, it has been clear in recent months that a struggle for the control of financial policy was pro ceeding between M. Bader and General Amir Khosrovi. This has now resulted in victory for the General, who will find himself in control of the country s finances at a singularly difficult moment. There is reason to Mi!iktrt ha f p- S firSt ac |; lvlt y Wl11 be a P ur g e of those elements of the nn ?Pv t y Th F i nance 1 wh ^. 1 ar . e most closel y connected with M. Bader’s policy. The financial abilities of General Amir Khosrovi remain to beproved. He has certainly acquired some knowledge of banking during the last few years, but has always struck me as having rather optimistic ideas of the expenditure which this country can afford. Direct experience of the Ministry of Finance may however engender a more cautious attitude. 3. The selection of Dr. Matin Daftary for the post of Prime Minister has caused some surprise. He is one of the youngest of the Cabinet Ministers and, while he has been quite an effective Minister of Justice he is a man of the official or civil service type, rather than one of any popular appeal. But so long as he can accurately carry out the orders of the Shah the personality of the Prime Minister is of no great importance at present. 4. The appointment of M. Jam as Minister of the Court fills a post which has been vacant since the fall of Teymourtache. The Minister of the Court ranks next to the Prime Minister but does not attend Cabinet Councils. Mr. Jam has expressed to me great pleasure at his new appoint ment, which is likely, in his case, to be of honour rather than of great influence. I think however that such influence as he may be able to exer cise at Court will be in the right direction. 5. The Ministry of Justice will now be in the hands of the present Under Secretary, M. Mohammed Sorouri, as Acting Minister, and General 'Amir Khosrovi is succeeded at the National Bank by M. Mohammed Ali, Farzin. 6.

I have the honour to transmit herewith a short memorandum prepared by the Commercial Secretary on the subject of Czech commercial interests in Iran. 2. lam sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Ministry of Economic Warfare, the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo, and to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department. Enclosure II to S. No. (35). IRAN. Czech Movements. It is estimated that there are still about six hundred Czechs in Iran, most of them in the employ of commercial firms such as S. A. Skoda-Iran, Lanna Company, Cesko-Moravska, the Iranian State Railways, etc. With few exceptions, the majority may be considered as anti-Nazi. Three, however, are known to be paid spies of the Gestapo : Sedlhon, Miss. Krikagowa and Gayda, whose brother was formerly Chief of the Czech General Staff.132 57 Czech interests are primarily represented by Skoda-Iran. Monsieur Zanda, the managing director, is a keen Czech patriot. He has been in serious trouble with the German Legation in Tehran, firstly because he refused to remove the picture of Monsieur Benes which was hung in his office, but which he finally had to do though he still refused to hang up a picture of Herr Hitler and secondly, because it became known that he had given instructions to his Czech employees to refrain from sending their children to the German school. Skoda-Iran are finding it more and more difficult to work in Iran. They are unable to obtain their materials from Germany and because of the nationality of the firm, orders placed in the United Kingdom and India are not being carried out. Monsieur Zanda has been seriously considering the severing of connexions with the Prague office which is managed by a brother of Field Marshal Goering and the re-organisation of the company as a purely Iranian Company. Skoda, Prague have an agent in Tehran, Herr Preissler, a Czech Jew sent out by the Gestapo to buy raw material. Herr Preissler was parti cularly active before the outbreak of war but since early September he has stopped buying. He claims that there are difficulties both as regards prices and transport but he has stated privately that he intends to avail himself of every possible means to prevent important raw materials from reaching the Protectorate, viz., Germany. There are only a few Jews in the Skoda-Iran Company, the majority without their families as the latter were held back as hostages. Though it is not possible to confirm the report that the Skoda proper are in close touch with Monsieur Benes through an Allied Power, the fact remains that they are well posted with news regarding Czech move ments in the United Kingdom and France, and it is quite possible that the firm of Skoda-Iran, though placed on the Statutory List, is actually endeavouring to restrict German activity in Iran. (36) No. 159. To The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi, With the compliments of His Majesty’s Representative. Memo, by H. M. M. of an audience with the Shah. British Legation, Tehran, 28th November 1939. Enclosure to S. No. (36). AUDIENCE WITH THE SHAH. 24th November 1939. After the usual preliminaries the Shah referred to the war and to the effects which (according to the interpreter) this struggle for supremacy was producing throughout the world. I said that I was not sure if I had followed His Majesty correctly, but so far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned they had certainly not entered upon the war in any desire to secure supremacy in Europe or elsewhere: they had been forced into (S) 61 EAD58 war by the continued German aggression on their weaker neighbours. The Shah said he was informed of the motives of the contending belligerents, and considered that an allied victory would, from the point of view of other states, be preferable to a German one. 2. The Shah then speculated on the eventual possibility of the two sides ever becoming reconciled and I said that we hoped this could be brought about, if the aggressive methods of present day Germany were abandoned. 3. The Shah then turned to Iranian policy, that of strict neutrality. He said that Iran w^as not strong enough to take part in a war and not weak enough to permit her rights to be ignored. A policy of neutrality was necessary to Iran and was also of value to the belligerent powers. I said that the position of Iran was fully appreciated in London and, on His Majesty referring to the useful role which Iran could play and was playing in helping to keep things quiet in this part of the world I said that this was also the desire of His Majesty’s Government. At this point the Shah began hinting that he was not quite sure that his position was fully appreciated in London and that there were perhaps ways in which His Maj esty’s Government might have afforded support to a friendly country. I asked whether His Majesty had any special point in mind, as it was certainly the desire of His Majesty’s Government to conduct the war with the least possible interference with neutral interests. His Majesty replied that this was not what he had in mind; what he meant to say was not exactly a complaint, but he had the feeling that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had not pressed on with their new developments in the way which would aiebeen to the interest both of the Company and the Iranian Government. I asked if this observation referred to the three months since the war began, as it was inevitable that development work should be held up in present circumstances. The Shah said however that he was not referring to the time since the war began, but to the preceding period. The Coim pany had certainly undertaken certain development work, but he felt that it would have been possible to do more. He asked me to mention his views on this point on my return to London. 4. As this matter was exhaustively explained to His Majesty in the Spring by Lord Cadman it appeared to me useless to enter into any very prolonged argument. I said that the Company was naturally anxious in their own interests as well as those of Iran to sell as much oil as they could : their development programme was based on commercial grounds • I would of course report in London what he had said to me. • 5. The Shah then raised the question of goods purchased by Iran in Germany, and the announcement that exports from Germany would be stopped. He said that Iran had m the past dealt with Czechoslovakia and Austria as well as with Germany, but those countries had b?en taken bv Germany, with the result that an even larger proportion of IraiVs trade .was with Germany than had been the case before. There were now arge quantities of goods awaiting shipment, which, according to His Maiestv had been either fully paid for or 75 per cent, paid for bffore the war If they could not be shipped Germany would keep both the ^oods and the money, and the loss would fall not on Germany but on Iran I said that I had not yet received instructions on this point, and could only say that I would report H.s Majesty’s views to London. I added that the Germans were attempting, by means contrary to every rule of Interna Horn, Ma w to prevent ships whether neutral or not, taking goods to or from the United Kingdom. In these circumstances it could not hp OYr _ fA i fv U . ni i?. (1 •Majesty’s Government should continue to allow German goods to bMre^ly exported by sea. His Majesty did not dispute this but said tLt in ill present case the loss would fall not on Germany but ’on Tran w n i h u to the possibility of finding alternative means'of^pcmt buMaM the sea route was of course preferable. ^ ’ Ul saia tJiat6. Before I left His Majesty said that he hoped that my work in London would not exclude a continued interest in Iranian affairs. He added, un fortunately, that, supposing Iran should attain sufficient importance to be an Ambassadorial post, I might perhaps return as Ambassador. I endeavoured to convince His Majesty that, in the eyes of His Majesty’s (government, tlie status of Iran was in no way inferior to that of some of the countries where there are Ambassadorial posts, but I fear His Majesty continues in the view that there ought to be a British Ambassador here. 7. This audience lasted about 45 minutes and the Shah was personally most friendly. He appeared well and vigorous, but his references to Anglo- Iranian Oil Company developments and to the status of this Legation certainly suggested to me that he is becoming slow in adjusting his ideas and has even now no clear idea of the possible or probable effects of the war on Iranian economy. He did not refer to the question of Export Credits Guarantee Department credits and, as I knew the Minister of Finance had not seen him since His Majesty’s return to Tehran two days ago I had decided not to raise the matter myself. No. 158. To (37) The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi. With the compliments of His Majesty’s Representative. Tehran desp. No. 371 of 25/11/39. British Legation, Tehran, 25th November 1939. Enclosure to S. No. (37). Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 371 (822/2/39), dated the 25th November 1939. I have the honour to report that His Highness Abdul Hussain Farman- Farmayan, G.C.M.G., better known by his former title of Farman Farma, died in Tehran on the 22nd November. 2. On the death of the Farman Farma’s son, Prince Firuz, which was reported in my despatch No. 13 of the 15th January 1938, no public announcement whatever was allowed to appear. Prince Firuz had long been under a cloud, and his death was allowed to transpire by way of rumour, inevitably accompanied by hints of foul play. The acre of' the Farman Farma (over 80), and the fact that he spent his latter °years in free and quiet residence in Tehran, in undisturbed enjoyment of his astonish- ing powers of procreation, have disposed of any such suggestion in his case. Nevertheless, the fact that he was the most eminent surviving Qajar prince (please see No. 77 in Personalities), and that he was a welfknown public figure of an age that is now officially disparaged, caused the Presi dent of the Majlis, Monsieur Hassan Esfandiary, who is connected with him by marriage, to make enquiries of the Shah when it was seen that the old man was ailing and likely to die. Evidently the answer was reassuring, for the death and the holding of two memorial services, one in a mosque and the other at the deceased’s residence, have been announced in the press over Monsieur Hassan Esfandiary’s signature. {S) 61 EAD.-^t V* 60 3. In view of the Farman Farma’s close association with British authorities in the past, and since he held the honour of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, I sent my condolences, and the- senior Iranian member of the Legation staff attended one of the memorial services. The Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be approached in order to recover the insignia of the G.C.M.G. 4. The death of the Farman Farma severs a most outstanding link with the period of the Qajar dynasty, and in particular with that of British intervention in South Persia at the time of the War of 1914—18. Since the establishment of the Pahlavi regime he has lived in retirement, but not in oblivion. For the family life of this remarkable old man has never ceased to be a subject of reverent comment. Until almost the end of his days he was mating and breeding, and though the birth rate in the later stages fell to less than three per annum, the aged father yielded to none in the assiduous care with which he kept tract of all his numerous progeny, and it is a fact that he has been known, when an acquaintance made reference to one of the younger ones, to bring out a well thumbed little pocket-book in which particulars were entered, and turn up the relevant page. He is the type of the Persian grandee that was once common, but under modern conditions is fast disappearing. 5. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Secretary to the Gov ernment of India in the External Affairs Department, and His Majesty’s Consular officers at Ahwaz, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Tabriz.

Monsieur Filimenoff’s predecessor, Monsieur Tchernikh, went' on leave on the 11th October 1938 and has not returned to Tehran.

In my two telegrams Nos. 1 and 2, dated the 1st January, I reported the con versation which I had had with His Majesty the Shah on the occasion of the pre sentation of my Letters of Credence. I now submit this more detailed report. 2. His Majesty received me with what I understand to be his customary air of sceptical gloom. After the exchange of a few conventional remarks I said That while I had spent a few weeks many years ago in a country called Iran, I found myself now in a different country. This appeared to produce a slight inaw, and I took advantage of it to ask whether His Majesty would care to hear what was the present position of several questions which His Majesty had at heart. His Majesty consented eagerly and at once asked me to sit down. Attached is a copy of a brief which I had taken with me. I went through it point by point, the Minister for Foreign Affairs interpreting and, as I noticed interpreting very carefully. The Shah listened attentively, and after each point had been translated to him he made a comment. The comments were as follows. ?• Credits .—-(This was the one point where the Minister for Foreign Affairs translation was not happy. He used the Persian word for ‘ loan \ However, the Shah did not refer to this). The Shah expressed satisfaction at tne progress that had been made. He referred to a text for the agreement which was being discussed between ‘ a company ’ and ‘ the National 'Bank of lian . I was not sufficiently well up in the negotiations to be able to pursue the sueject, but I found out afterwards that His Majesty’s remarks were probably based on misleading information supplied by the Minister of Finance. —■ ■J3 ( 2 ) Fthjm British Legation, Tehran, No. 11, dated the 26th January 1940.

In accordance with a now established custom I recently, as a newly-arrived ivl mister, received a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to call upon is Imperial Highness the Crown Prince. His Highness lives in the finest of a group of palaces which have been constructed for the children of His Maiestv ihe Shah. It is a very modern building, and of its kind handsome. The interior, v inch is all marble and marquetene, shows that the people of Iran have been spared no expense m its construction. w + 2 i‘ T1 ?f • ma 1 nn i er of t ^. 1 Pri I lc ' is 1 1 ittle more engaging than that of the Shah, i 1 ?™ 1 g + l0 T 0f w e father becomes in the son a pessimistic petulance imfJn at ^ ei ? 1 P t t0 restrain.

To this I replied that it seemed to me that Russia’s preoccupations in the maintenance of an army in Poland and the carrying on of the Finnish campaign, with the demoralization and disorganization which these were known to have produced, made it almost, if not quite impossible for her to undertake further adventures. We ourselves N had been disposed to regard Russia as incapable of carrying on an external war and it seemed clear that the Soviet Government had in fact never intended to become engaged in one. In fact the developments of the last two months en couraged the belief that the danger of a Russian attack in the South and Middle Fast was steadily diminishing. 2. Though Faiz Mohammed expressed agreement with my view, he refused to be altogether comforted. He however, stated in the most emphatic terms his conviction that if the Finnish war were to continue for three or four months there would be an internal outbreak in Russia. He was absolutely certain that this was the case. Bokhara, Khiva, Samarkand and Ferghana were all disaffected and ripe for trouble : in tact the whole Moslem element in Russia was ready for revolt if Russia’s present difficulties continued long. 3. I asked Faiz Mohammed whether in expressing these opinions he was basing himself on definite information. He replied in the affirmative. He told me that he knew that there still existed in Berlin an organization of representa tives ot these Moslem districts of Russia, which was engaged in working out schemes for cheating internal trouble in the Soviet Union. This organization had existed fior a long time and continued to exist in spite of the present Russo- German understanding. Faiz Mohammed asserted that it actually worked inside the German Foreign Office. In addition to this, leaders of these subversive movements were congregated in Kabul, which was a centre for these activities. 4. As regards the attitude of Afghanistan herself to Russia, His Excellency spoke very firmly saying that resistance was essential and that British support was of course greatly to be desired. He advocated the utmost possible touch between the two Governments. 5. I shortly afterwards met the Iranian Ambassador and asked him what he lelt about these matters. Monsieur Kazemi agreed with me that Russia was greatly weakened and that the danger to Iran from that quarter was greatly diminished. In fact he appeared to be less alarmed than his Afghan colleague liad led me to expect. ( 4 ) Decypher i-rom Sir H. Kxatchbtjll-Htjgessen (Angora), No. 55, dated the 15th January, 1940.

I I ha\e the honour to report that the Shah’s return from a visit to his noithern estates and to the Turkoman races has resulted in a crop of arrests, as not infrequently happens. The most important of those who have had the mis-5 fortune to incur the Shah’s displeasure are l\lurteza Quli Samsam Bakhtiari (No. 49 in Personalities) and Amir Seham-ud-Din Ghaffari (No. 89 in Personali ties). 2. The former was the last of the important Bakhtiari Khans to escape trouble. He was detained by the police for two days, and then released. No reason for this has yet transpired. 3. Amir Seham-ud-Din Ghaffari has recently been head of the Government industrial school (“ hunaristan ’*), and was reported to have come under Nazi influence, a thing which his German education and the presence of numerous Germans participating in the industrial development of this country would render quite likely. No reason for his arrest and that of his elderly father on '21st November has been given, and no one has been allowed to see them. But lie is still drawing his salary in prison as head of the industrial school, while the police are examining his “ dossier ”, and the general rumour connects him with a design to form a sort of Nazi party in Iran. 4. The remaining arrests, said to number about thirty, include some army officers, and the charges are said to be varied. ( 6 ) From Sra R. Bulpard, (Tehran), No. 29, bated the 1st February, 1940. The Military Attache called at the house of Minister for War January 31st at the request of the latter. The Minister unexpectedly gave the Military Attache complete figures of all kinds of aircraft in Iran and then asked for help in securing aircraft from the United Kingdom which were needed by the spring for defence of Iran though it might already be too late. The Minister said that be had instructed Colonel Shaibani to order thirty Wellington bombers and thirty Blenheim or Beaufort bombers. Could delivery be expedited ? The Minister agreed that Iran needed fighters and said that thirtv Curtiss machines would probably be bought in the United States while Colonef Shaibani had been instructed to try to secure twenty Hurricanes in addition to fifteen promised bv His Majesty’s Government. The Minister indicated that Italian machines would probably not be bought because of financial difficulties and of technical objection to the introduction of another type of aircraft. When the Military Attache suggested the need for a larger proportion of fighters the Minister agreed, but insisted on the necessity to carry the war into the enemy camp and expressed readiness to sacrifice half of the bombing strength of Iran in order to destroy or damage Baku. In conclusion the Minister speaking very personally and in confidence said that he thought it was time for “ us ” to co-ordinate plans as we had the same end in view. He could not say this to the Shah and has suggested it could only come through diplomatic channels. The Military Attache was very guarded on this point. No action will be taken on the suggestion about co-ordination of plans which could hardly have been made without the Shah’s instructions. The rest of the minister for War’s communication is an interesting indication of the Iranian Government’s forecast of Soviet action in the spring and of their probably un justified belief that their Air Force could do serious damage to Baku.

The deficiency m metal cover, up to a proportion of 60 per cent., will be covered by the Crown Jewels, transferred to the National Bank of Iran m accordance with the law of the 25th Aban, 1316 (17th Novem ber, 1937) until such date as these are sold for gold ”. S. The present authorised limit is 1,176,163,600, but I learn from a reliable source that the note issue to date had not exceeded 1,080,000,000. 4. For some months past the National Bank of Iran have been drastically restricting their commercial credits to the Bazaar, to such an extent in fact, that ■ y f , as . s merchants have been forced to borrow at 24 per cent, per annum and even higher There would seem to he little doubt that the object of this policy is to try to keep the note circulation within limits. 5. As there is no market in Iran for the Government to borrow in, and as the Gou e h«3^ nt b t en /?i endlng in excess of revenue, increase in note circula tion had inevitably to follow. tothelWcfr tf W - W?S ' nan ™? usI J r approved by the Mejlis and was passed to me t inance Commission tor study and report. out •Im™!wJ fl l3 Ia - C ! 1 th i e Commission’s report approving the draft law, with- out amendment, was introduced to the Mejlis.

Tehran despatch No. 57 of 17th February 1940. Enclosure to Serial No. (9). From British Legation, Tehran, to F. 0. London, No. 57, (302|2|40), dated the 17th February 1940. 1 have the honour to report that Mr. J. A. Jameson, a director of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and former general manager in [ran, accompanied by Mr. Pattinson, the present General Manager, and Mr. Wilson, consultant architect, arrived in Tehran a few days ago from Abadan. Mr. Jameson, who left England about three weeks ago, brought a message for the Shah from Lord Oadman. He was received in audience yesterday and this morning he was good enough to give me some account of what passed. 2. Mr. Jameson said that he had been given the task of explaining to the Shah the reasons why the Company were not able to maintain the volume of sales of their products which had been reached in 1937 and 1938. He had pointed out that the situation had been fundamentally altered by the outbreak of hostilities. Before the war many people had assumed that owing to the requirements of the armed forces the sales of petroleum companies would be considerably increased. But this view had been shown to be mistaken. Not only had defence departments laid in large stocks of oil in anticipation but up to the present the consumption of the armed forces had not come up to general expectation. Moreover, consumption by other users had fallen very consider ably owing to the restrictions imposed by His Majesty’s Government on private owners of motor vehicles. Again, sales w-ere more than ever dependent upon the factor of shipping facilities, and owing to the longer haul the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were at a serious disadvantage as compared with other oil com panies which supplied European markets. It might be possible to maintain sales in Far Eastern markets but these were less important than Europe. The Company had also lost four tankers as a result of enemy action. 3. The Shah, Mr. Jameson said, appeared to be unconvinced by these arguments. His Majesty said that he w 7 as tired of promises which remained unfulfilled and he maintained the view that Iranian oil must be in great demand everywhere. He washed Lord Cadman to know that he looked to the Company to see that production did not drop below 7 the figures reached in 1937. He also referred to the connection of His Majesty’s Government with the Company and he seemed to imply that this fact should benefit Iran. Mr. Jameson thought that His Majesty meant him to understand that it must surely be to the advantage of Great Britain to buy oil from Iran rather than from other sources since Iranian oil could be paid for in sterling and no question of foreign exchange need there fore arise. He also implied that the money wdiich resulted from sales to Great Britain would be devoted to Iranian purchases in the United Kingdom and that it would therefore go back to the United Kingdom. 4. Mr. Jameson thought that the Shah’s refusal to accept the Company’s explanation w r as not due to his failure to understand the developments wdiich had taken place since war broke out ; rather w 7 as it due to his unwillingness to admit to himself that the matter was beyond his control. It wns not in his nature, once he had set his heart upon a scheme, to admit failure, no matter how formidable the difficulties might be. In spite of all kinds of obstacles he had insisted on the completion of the Trans-Iranian Railway and he had had his way. Similarly, Mr. Jameson thought, he would not admit the possibility that the royalties from oil could owing to the w 7 ar be seriously reduced. Nevertheless, the attitude of His Majesty had throughout been friendly and even cordial. After the main business had been discussed the Shah recalled previous occasions on which he had met^Mr. Jameson and added that he would be visiting Khuzistan in about a month’s time. He did not say whether he would include the oil fields in his tour. 5. Mr. Jameson and his party propose to leave Tehran tomorrow on their return to the South. 6. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Depart ment, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo.&amp; Estimates of Expenditure for the coming year amount to Bials 3,210,973,027 (£47,924,970 at the official rate of Rials 67 to the pound sterling) and Revenue is estimated at Rials 3,094,393,977 (£46,184,984) leaving a deficit of Rials 116,579,050 (£1,739,985). Although revenue from oil is not calculated in the ubove figures, the estimated revenue for the year shows an increase of just over one million rials over last year’s figures. 3. Comparative lists of the chief sources of Revenue, as also of Expenditure herewith transmitted show the increases over the 1939-40 budget. 4. Under Revenue the Sugar and Monopoly Tax, Rials 180,000,000 and the Road Tax, Rials 85,000,000 appear under Customs Duties, possibly to swell the Customs Receipts which are known to have fallen considerably during the past few months. 5. The receipts from the various Government Monopoly Companies are not given separately as in previous budgets but are calculated at Rials 835,000,000, which figure would seem to be grossly exaggerated. Similarly, estimated revenue from Industries at Rials 367,000,000 is nearly double that of last year. The most interesting figures are the following :■—sale of embroideries, pottery, etc., from Rials 60,000 to 500,000 ; the tar and sleeper factory from Rials 37.000. 000 to 50.000,000 ; factory No. 5 from Rials 10,000,000 to 29,000,000 ; Ihe glycerine and soap factory from Rials 10,000,000 to 50,000,000 ; the cemer* factories from Rials 60,000,000 to 80,000,000 ; and the sugar factories from RL 42.000. 000 to 80,000,000. 6. On the expenditure side, with one exception, namely the Ministry of Interior and Public Health, there are notable increases in respect of all Ministries and Administrations. This year again, the Ministry of Roads and Communi cations tops the list with Rials 999,136,800 (£15,000,000) made up as follows Rials 120,000,000 (£1,889,552) for roads. Rials 862,991,800 (£12,880,474) con struction and maintenance of the railway and port expenses at Bandar Shah, Bandar Shahpour and Nowshar. 7. The estimated expenditure for the Ministry of war amounts to Rials 463,729,980 (£6,921,304). In addition to this sum the Minister of Finance is authorised to spend an additional sum^of £2,000,000 out of reserves for army requirements. 8. The estimates for the Ministry of Industry and Mines reach the fantastic figure of Rials 724,620,000 (£10,815,223) an increase of Rials 296,190,000 (£4,420,761) over the figures for 1939-40. The main items are the following spinning mill and school for weaving, Rials 42,000,000 ; glycerine and soap factory, 39,000,000 ; tar and sleeper factory, 41,000,000 ; sugar factories, 147.000. 000 ; administration of mines, blast furnaces and copper refinery, 275.000. 000 : cement factories, 46,000,000 ; caustic soda factory, 46,000,000 ; nitric soda factory, 23,000,000. 9. Further items of special interest figure under miscellaneous expendi ture, grain silos (engagements of previous years) Rials 20,000,000, construction and maintenance of slaughter houses, 5,000,000, printing of bank notes, 7,500,000, service of foreign debt 5,500,000, repayment of State loan to the National Bank of Iran, 100,000,000, purchase of a dredger, 6,500,000, telegraph and postal cor- respondence of Government administration, 25,000,000, purchase of tankers 7.750.000, capital of Agricultural Bank 5,500,000, and credits in previous year due, 35,000,000. 10. To meet the declared deficit the Minister of Finance is authorised to make use of unforeseen receipts, surplus revenue from commercial enterprises of the State and by borrowings from banks in the country. 11. It is undoubtedly a very optimistic budget but it is reported that it was prepared in a hurry by the Minister of Finance, General Amir Rhosrovi, and a number of new officials who now surround him, with the result that estimates, both for receipts and expenditure, are carelessly compiled and grave disappoint ment at the results at the end of the year are to be expected. 12 12.

I have the honour to inform you that my American colleague informs me that the Iranian Government are contemplating trying to arrange a plan for purchases in the United States of America to the value of some $60,000,000 over a period of three years. Mr. Engert enquired of the Prime Minister, who raised the question, whether these purchases would depend on United States purchases m Iran and was informed that, while the Iranian Government realised that the tinted States of America could not consent to a clearing agreement, the} 7- hoped that it might be possible to be made from Iran up to approximately the value of the goods bought from the United States of America by Iran. The Prime Minister also said that the Iranian Government would like United States help m tlle development of Iran’s mineral resources (please see in this connection iIma 0 °^ ra ^ 1S ' ^^ an( ^ ^ le 22nd December 1939, and 19th January 1940, respectively). J .

His doubts, moreover, seem justified in view of the fact that an American offer to supply cement was recently turned down on the ground that V ^ as J° 0 iate ’ the only consolation given being to the effect that the Iranian Government might consider the American offer, if satisfactory, if and when further quantities were required. 3.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a brief summary of events ^ and conditions in the Shiraz Consular District during 1939, which is prepared annually at the request of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. The material for the summary is taken for the greater part from the monthly diaries of this Consulate and from other reports submitted by me in the course of the year. Sub-enclosure to Serial No. (14). Summary of Events and Conditions in the Shiraz Consular District during THE YEAR 1939. General SifuaGon .—Life in this district pursued an even tenour in 1939. No disturbances or agitations occurred and no reforms or developments were embarked upon. Even the outbreak of war in Europe produced, in this general inactivity, peculiarly little effect. It is true that the steady rise in the cost of living was aiven further impetus, the boycott of foreigners and in particular of this Consulate was intensified and the remnant of the export trade finally dis located but no fresh evils came into being and anxiety over the future problem of obtaining supplies from abroad was only one of a few small clouds on the horizon. Local Administration. —Ears, now designated 'the 7th Ustan, was deprived of an able and honest administrator by the death in December of Abul Hassan Pirnia. He was appointed Governor-General (Ustandar) only in January and in view of the constant going and coming of minor officials it is doubly unfortu nate that this province should not have enjoyed for longer his beneficent rule. L r p to the end of the year no one had been nominated to succeed him and in the absence of a Governor (Farmandar) the practical direction of affairs fell more than ever into the hands of the military authorities and the General Officer com manding the Ears division became the virtual LTstandar. Military intervention in civil affairs led to no increase of local initiative y for the army is obsessed even more than the civil administration with dread of the Shah’s displeasure and action, at any rate of a beneficial kind, was paralysed by the pernicious precaution of always referring to Tehran before taking the pettiest decision. Communications .—No work was undertaken of any major importance. The Shiraz-Eiruzabad road progressed no further than Firuzabad and the Kazerun- Basht-Behbehan road is not yet open to traffic. The military road from Shiraz to Behbehan via Ardakan is closed to civilians after Tul-i-Khosrovi. In the spring the Shiraz-Isfahan road was put in good condition for the benefit of the foreign delegations visiting Iran for the Crown Prince’s wedding but little has been done to it since and the surface, especially between Shiraz and Persepolis, is rapidly deteriorating. Petrol pumps and oil depots were installed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany at convenient intervals throughout the whole length of the road from Bushire to Tehran. Aancvlt'ure .—As a result of the plentiful winter rainfall grain crops were excellent. Fruit suffered from late frosts in April. Sugar beet in nearly all parts of the district was attacked by caterpillars and only a poor crop was obtained. The cotton prop was good but much distress was caused by the Shah’s prohibition of the cultivation of rice, for the waterlogged lands suitable for rice can rarely be put to an alternative use. Trade .—The export trade in the produce of Ears such as gum tragacanth, redgum insoluble, lamskins, almonds, seeds and licorice roots, struggled feebly in the toils of innumerable governmental restrictions until the war gave it the death blow. Shipments to Germany in the first half of the year were affected under the clearing agreement and to Italy under private barter arrangements. The suggestion of German importers that gum and licorice should be shipped21 from Bandar Sliah via the U. S. 8. R. was rejected by local merchants who fore saw much trouble and little profit and efforts were later initiated to find an out let in India. r l lie import trade, apart from a few consignments of barter goods from Italy, had long since succumbed to the difficulties created by the exchange and mono- P°ly regulations and practically all foreign supplies were drawn from Tehran. British trade remained nil and siams of the British drive to increase exports were not apparent up to the end of the year. In spite of all things, however, the returns of ihe Shiraz branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran for the year ended September 20th, j 939 showed that satisfactory profits were being maintained. Indust)y — flie cotton mills of Isfahan and Shiraz, the woollen factories of Isfahan and the silk factories of Yezd all continued to work satisfactorily and supplied all local requirements. Difficulties however were anticipated for the future m obtaining the requisite supply of dyes from Germany. ..,!; h 'h^ gar fac l :0 7 ^ orv ff as hf was expanded to cope with a production of 100,000 tons and the usual party of Czech technicians arrived for the sugar- boilmg season with only a slight delay. rite laachincry for the grain silos at Isfahan and Shiraz which ‘was to be supplied from die 0.

I have the honour to inform you that a census of the population of Tehran and its suburbs was taken on the 1st March 1940. This is the first time that a census, conducted in anything like a scientific manner (i.e., a counting of heads within one single day), has ever been taken in this country, with the exception of an experimental census, done last year in the town of Kashan, as a preli minary to the completion of plans for that of Tehran. 2. (Questionnaire forms were delivered by the police to householders a number of days before the date of the census. These forms had in general to be completed before the census, and returned to the authorities, who made a house to house visit on the actual day of the counting, and compared the com pleted 1 orms with the actual facts. Each resident was required to remain between the hours of 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. on March 1st within the bounds of the house from which he had submitted a form, unless a special pass (for doctors midwives, etc.), had been obtained beforehand.

The primitive un-,piped water supply would alone render such a prodigious increase of residents unlikely. The figures have official sanc tion, the census was elaborately carried out, and I have no positive evidence to set against this ; but I cannot resist the impression that the remarkable com parison with previous estimates owes something, whether by belittling the past or by exaggerating the present or both, to the propaganda that claims the inauguration of a golden age of prosperity for the present regime, and that half a million was the smallest figure thought respectable for the capital of the King of Kings.

Despatch from British Legation, Tehran, to Foreign Office, No. 132 (59|9|40), dated 8th May 1940. In his telegram No. 89 of the 17th March, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad reported that when Nuri Pasha telegraphed to the foreign ministers of the other Saadabad powers, on the formation of the Gailani Cabinet, he received warm official replies from Ankara and Kabul but from Tehran nothing but a personal telegram. On May 2nd, however, the birthday of the young King of Iraq, the Tehran newspapers printed friendly reference to Iraq and mentioned the Saadabad Pact. The “ Journal de Teheran ”, for instance, said : “ Ces relations sinceres et amicales ont ete a la base du Pacte de Saad-Abad, qui con- firme Punite at 1’amitie entre ITran et ITraq.” The Iraq Charge d’Affaires informs me that it was he who induced the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have these articles published. Until recently, he says, the Iranian Government ■were &lt;iiraid to mention the Pact, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs even told him that when Mr. Sarajoglou went to Moscow the Iranian Government telegraphed to their representative in Moscow to urge Mr. Sarajoglou to keep as quiet as possible about the Pact. The change may be due to some extent to the lurkish Ambassador, who, according to accounts which he has given me from time to time, has repeatedly urged the Minister for Foreign, Affairs to 1 stand up to the Russians and'has tried to make him realise that if Russia ever attacked Iran, Turkey could not afford to stand idle. In this connection I | enclose a summary of an article which appeared in the “ Ettalaat ” of the 16th April, on the subject of union between the eastern peoples. The writer repre sents this union as a neutral growth hastened by the disillusion suffered by the eastern peoples after the 1914 war, and he refers in ptarticular to Turkey : Iran and turkey, he says, will assist each other in face of anything that may happen. A similar line was followed in what purported to be a letter to the editor of the same newspaper which w T as published on April 28th. This writer daclare that jt is not merely a question of political agreements but a matter of popular sentiment in the various countries of the Near East, in particular'Iran, lie utters the warning that “ thousands of non-orientals ” would prefer dis union to reign between the peoples of the East and do not hesitate to create misunderstandings and suspicions and even to publish provocative statements. • - - -2. It is not suggested that Iran is a very useful member of the Saadabad group or that the Iranians would in fact, as the enclosed article asserts, sacri fice their lives in defence of liberty and independence ; but it is of interest that the Iranian Government should have plucked up courage enough to speak openly of the pact with their three neighbours. 3. Copies of this despatch and its enclosure are being sent to His Majesty ’s Ambassadors at Ankara and Bagdad, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo. Sub-Enclosure to Serial No. (17). Summary of Article in the “ Ettcdaat ” of 16th April 1940. The present war has reminded eastern countries of the value which they have for each other. The 1914 war brought great loss and unhappiness to the eastern peoples, but at the same time it gave them a good lesson. They realised that not only had they gained no advantage from the promises and deceptions of Europe during the XIX century, but they had been the victims of her ambi tions. They therefore chose that moment for their resurrection, rallying round leaders of genius to whom they entrusted the reigns of authority, hitherto in the hands of foreign agents ; and while the European peoples tried to repair •the damage and losses of the War, those of the East advanced rapidly along the path of civilisation, making up for the time they had lost. The first thing for them to do was to unite, disunion fostered by foreigners having been one of the greatest faults of’the East. Forgetting their small differences they opened the way to a real union by the conclusion of political pacts and economic agree ments. The present war has shown the value of this union. If during the last war eastern countries took up arms 'to serve the purposes of the belligerent powers, to-day they are endeavouring to constitute a solid barrier in order to maintain their neutrality and preserve the peace in this part of Asia. They are resolved to lend each other brotherly aid in'these critical moments. Such a union, such brotherhood, reigns in fact between Iran and Turkey. These two countries will assist each other in face of anything that may happen. This union, which has come about naturally, without talk or propaganda, is a new fact in the political world. The peoples of Europe would never have imagined that this large portion of the world formerly the plaything of their ambitions, could turn into an impassable barrier. They could never have believed that these noble peoples would aim at the destruction of foreign designs upon them. “ It is our wish ”, they cry, “ to make peace reign over these countries, once the battle-field of rival ambitions ; and by concord and unity to defend our liberty and our independence. For that ideal we are prepared to sacrifice our lives ( 18 ) Fkom Bitish Legation, Tehran, No. 70 (218j8|40), dated 18th May 1940. Tehran Press Attache despatch No. 218|8|40, dated 18th May 1940.

I have dealt with the internal situation as affecting British interests in my telegram No. 136 of May 17th to the Foreign Office. 2. A copy of this despatch and enclosure is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign, Affairs, the Political Intelligence Department.

Keport from Press Attache, to British Legation, Tehran;, No. 218]8|40, datejo 18th May 1940. I have the honour to transmit to you the following report. 2. With reference to my despatch of 8th April 1940, paragraphs 7 and 8, it is evident that discontent at the present regime is becoming more and more marked. This is of interest in so far as it is accompanied by strong anti-British feeling. The reason for this is that the Shah is generally regarded as having won his position by means of British support. 1 3. Among many of the intellectuals there is a growing tendency to turn to communism as offering the only means /which may improve their lot. There is no evidence of any widespread communist organisation, but there is a clear tendency for political thought among the intellectuals to accept connnunist theory. It is not only the corruption and economic oppression which this class resents, but also the complete suppression of any political freedom. That this should lead them to communism is, if hardly logical, at least natural in the circum stances. 4. As for the masses of the people, in spite of their natural antipathy to* communism (see my letter to Professor Rushbrook-Williams of December 21st, 1939, (308j4|39), they could probably, in view of the increasing oppression and poverty, be won over to support some sort of communist movement, provided their circumstances were favourable to such a movement. 5. There are unconfirmed reports of communist propaganda which is being carried on with the connivance of sections of the police. There are some 60,000 Russian refugees who have entered the country relatively recently, and are now dispersed in the neighbourhood of Tehran and the provinces, and some 5,000 Persians who have recently been repatriated from Russia. These also are, at present, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Tehran. Many of these Russian refugees (who have become Persian subjects) and repatriated Persians are said to be communist agents, and to be in possession of funds for propaganda. 6. In connection with communist propaganda, it is worth mentioning that the Armenian Ramkavar party are said to be spreading Russian, and German propaganda, particularly in Tabriz and Isfahan. Their activity has increased since the signing of the Russo-Iranian Trade Agreement. Since that time also the police have kept a doser watch on the activities of the Armenian Dashnak party, one of whose objects in Iran was to combat communism (see my despatch of January 23rd, No. 218j2|40, paragraph 7). This may be merely a coincidence, but, coupled with other events, it seems not unlikely that there is collaboration between various members of the police and German and Russian agents. 7. On the other hand there are a large number of people who own property of some kind or other, even if the value of this is, in most cases, small. This body of opinion is strongly opposed to any form of communism. Although often discontented with the present regime, their fear that whatever has been left to them by the Shah would be seized by a communstically inclined govern ment such as might gain power with the support of the intellectuals, leads them to oppose any change likely to develop along such lines. At present, they represent a sufficiently strong interest to effect any likelihood of subversive activity by the intellectuals. Such activity is only likely to become dangerous to the regime if the stability of the latter is first threatened from some other quarter. 8. The sympathy for communism among the intellectuals is accompanied by pro-German feeling, which extends to nearly all sections of the communitv. It would probably not be an exaggeration to say that 70 per cent, of the middle and upper classes in Northern Iran are p.ro-Grerman. The reasons for this ha\ e been discussed in my letters to Professor Rushbrook-Williams, dated 14tb November 1939, No. 444125j39, and 9th March 1940, No. 218|4|40, paragraph 4. 9 The large number of Germans in the country—put at various figures, of which 1,,00 2 000 is probably the most accurate—is the cause for some anxiety. Many of them have arrived since the outbreak of war and are cer- tamly not bona-fide merchants. In the event of the stability of the regime being tnreatened, it is pot beyond the bonds of possibility that they would attempt, or29 rather instigate a coup d’etat. They are known to pay out considerable sums of money. The present Prime Minister, who has the reputation of being corrupt to a degree seldom surpassed even by Persians, is said to be in their hands. It is common talk that he was given his appointment because he was acceptable to the Germans. 10. In my letter to Professor Rushbrook-Williams of 21st Decem ber 1939, No. 308J4j39, to which I drew Your Excellency’s atten tion in my despatch of 23rd January, No. 21812(40, it was stated in paragraph 6 that the Shah would be forced to take cognizance of pro-German propaganda, on the grounds that this might tend to detract from his personal position or become a cloak for the expression of opposition to the regime. As yet there is little to show that the Shah has in fact reacted in the way expected. There are three possible explanations of this. Firstly that he is unaware of the extent to which German propaganda in Iran is being carried on—and it may be men tioned that the police take care that the Shah shall not be approached by anyone desiring to offer a petition and shall not receive such a petition by post. Secondly, that he regards the Germans with complacency as a brake on Soviet activities. Thirdly, it may be that the Shah’s lust for power and greed for money have so warped his judgment that, dominated by these two passions, he is unwilling to restrain these and fails to realise that the way in which he gives a tree rein to them may imperil their continued indulgence. 11. From what has been stated above, it will be seen that the local reaction to foreign affairs is largely governed by internal conditions. Particularly does this apply to the attitude towards Great Britain. This, in order that British piestige should regain the place which it formerly held in Iran, or should be able to compete successfully with growing German influence, two factors are i equired : namely military victories in Europe and an amelioration in the condition of the Iranian population, of which the second is not perhaps the least important. Could the Shah be induced to restrain, to some degree, oppres sion and to allow some, even if slight, freedom, it would in all probabilitv go far towards producing a more favourable attitude towards Great Britain, and essen the likelihood of successful German or Russian intrigue.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a report by the Press Attache on the internal situation, in continuation of the report which was enclosed in my despatch No. 18 [Enclosure to Serial No. (18)] of the 18th May. 2. A copy of this despatch and enclosure is being forwarded to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Political Intel ligence Department, Foreign Office, the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad, and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo. Sub-Enclosure to Serial No. (20). Hi: port from Press Attache, to British Legation, Tehran, No. 218110140, dated 17th July 1940. I have the honour to transmit to you the following report. 2. As regards internal events, the most striking since my last report to you, No. 218i8i40 of 18th May [Enclosure to Serial No. (18)], was the declaration of His Imperial Majesty to the deputies and editors of the newspapers on June 29th in which he expressed dissatisfaction at the way in which the affairs of state had been conducted and telling them that public opinion had to be enlightened m order to enable it to appraise the world situation correctly and to prepare it for hard times. 3. The immediate effect of this declaration was to cause widespread alarm regarding the possibility of Russian aggression against Iran. Fear of Russia is never entirely absent, but it ebbs and flows, and. after a short period, the extreme anxiety created by the Shah’s speech subsided somewhat in govern ment circles arid among the upper classes ; the middle classes however are still in a state of considerable trepidation lest Russia may invade Iran in the near ! future. 4. In the provinces of Azerbaijan and Mazandaran it is reported that the people would welcome any substitute for the present regime, be it Russian or .un\ other, but as against this it appears that many people prepared to leave Azerbaijan after the Shah’s speech, fearing that the Russians intended to enter Azerbaijan almost immediately. 18 perhaps wmrth mentioning that the Russian embassy gave on July 10th a film show of Peter the Great to which prominent Iranians and members of the diplomatic corps were invited. The show began with an unannounced item, viz. a 35-minute film showing in great detail a May Day parade in Moscow'. The effect of the show upon Iranians has been mixed. On the one hand ic lepetition of the Peter the Great film (for it had been shown in Tehran before) suggested that Russia had no intention at present of undertakino- or supporting any subversive movement against the Iranian Peter the Great, Riza okah ; on tne other hand, the pictures of the enormous pow r er of Russia in men and war material, as shown in the parade, served as a reminder to Iran of Af 1 ] P SR,a co ' d do andRhe ^ n i d - , Some observ ers are disposed to consider !, boss'a will confine herself for the moment to cultural penetration, and those tew who are anxious at the growth of German influence are inclined 10 other occu 11 kd eVe ° Pment “ th6 h ° Pe * hat German y and Eussia will keep each 0. Events in Europe since my last despatch have done little to alter the general trend of public opinion in Iran and have merely served generally speak,,ig, to strengthen the belief of the population in a German victory and to convince them of British weakness. Anti-British feeling continues'to be iivAvfh b 16 p ndency t0 regard a German victory as all but attained, while hugely due to German propaganda (especially that carried on through the and to German victories in 7. The defeat of France has created a somewhat unfortunate impression G^Er^hJw Tf T’? has hMorc been 'inch in evSce now at 1 ranee has been defeated a certain amount of pro-French feelino- is to be observed, and this chiefly in support of the Petain government coupled withflie belief that France’s defeat was due largely to lack of British support. It would seem, therefore, that this pro-French feeling is in part merely another manifestation of anti-British feeling. The tone of recent articles in the press, purporting to enlighten public opinion on the international 1 situation, though not openly hostile are of such a kind as to strengthen anti-British tendencies. For example an article entitled “ Why was France defeated ” in the Iran of July ' 16th states that this was due to two main causes, firstly lack of British support and. secondly French ignorance of mechanised warfare. Petain’s statement regarding British help to France is quoted and no mention is made of the British side of the question. 8. Talk of peace is once more common. While the desire for peace may be put forward under the pretext of the uselessness of war and its accompany ing slaughter, it is no doubt chiefly due, consciously or unconsiously, to the fear (hat the war may spread to the Middle East and to the hope that trade may improve on the conclusion of hostilities. 9. Allhough public opinion is strongly pro-German, the government on the other hand, have taken and are reported to be taking various measures against the Germans. This would seem to be connected with the violent attacks on the Shah in the Persian broadcasts from Berlin in the first week in July. The Tehran press protested on July 4th and 5th at the tone of these broadcasts without actually mentioning that attacks had been made on the Shah. A pre vious article, however, had already appeared on June 5th in the Ittila’at pro testing at the threatening tone of the Berlin broadcasts. 10. A number of Germans (said to be in the neighbourhood of 300) have been told to leave the country and are reported to be awaiting Russian visas. A number of others have also been moved from the southern provinces to Tehran, possibly in order that a closer watch may be kept on them. It is also reported that contracts granted to Germans are being scrutinised closely. 11. (n addition, the Prime Minister, Matin Daftary, who was known to have strong pro-German views, was dismissed on 26th June and replaced by Ali Mansur who has, amongst the older generation, at least, a reputation for being favourably disposed towards the British. It is not to be supposed that this in itself will lead to any change in the policy of the Iranian Government, but the effect of the change upon public opinion was on the whole favourable. 12. On the other hand in spite of the indications mentioned above that the government is becoming alive to the danger of possible German fifth column activities, any good effects which the above measures may have had on public opinion in Iran have been largely counteracted by the publication and discussion of the sixth German White Book. Extracts from this have been given in the press and in the Persian broadcasts from Berlin. A number of articles have appeared in the press (e.g., Ittila’at, July 8th, Iran, July 5th, 8th, 9th) on the subject, expressing surprise that the Russians should have taken the German allegations of Iranian complicity in Allied plans to bomb Baku and Batoum seriously aud that Iran, who had no cause to be pleased with Great Britain, had no reason to co-operate with the British, and repeating her oft-expressed inten tion of remaining neutral. In addition to this a DNB communique headed Tehran was published in the press stating that the Iranian Government were to take measures as a result of difficulties with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and that anti-British feeling especially after the publication of the German White Book was daily growing. The effect of this on public opinion, who know that the press is carefully controlled by the government, is to suggest to them that anti-British sentiments are not frowned upon by the authorities and that the latter are seeking to put themselves on good terms with Germany, which again suggests to them that the government consider a German victory likely. Mr. Butler’s statement in the House of Commons on this subject was reproduced in the local press, but has not, as yet, received much prominence, though it is known that the Minister for Foreign Affairs thought it satis factory. ! 13. Lastly it may be mentioned that the Iranian Government have taken this moment to make claims against the Anlglo-Iranian Oil Company. At one time there was a certain amount of talk among the people about expropriation, but this seems to have died down, and the general opinion to be that the Iranian Government are merely attempting to extort more money from the Company. That this should be so, however, does not tend to heighten the prestige of Great Britain.i After a small dinner given by the Regent on June 3rd to members of this [? Embassy], the Prime Minister who seemed grateful for my recent warn ings assured me that he was getting the internal situation well in hand. He was himself seeing Mutessarifs summoned from various centres to impress on them their responsibilities and was giving personal directions to the press. An endeavour was also being made to control propaganda activities in the coffee-shops. I took the opportunity to give the Prime Minister the message in paragrapli No. 1 of your telegram under reference which I have repeated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have furthermore warned them both of the need shown by the bombard ment in Holland for special care to protect the Regent and Government and leaders of the country generally against organized gangs and murder. Although steps taken to control propaganda in the press and elsewhere may only drive it below the surface the general impression shared by the British adviser to the Minister of the Interior is that the internal situation has improved. German, and to a lesser extent, the Italian wireless will remain as one of the chief means of propaganda until it can be jammed. Even if good use is being made of the existing transmitters I hope you will consider whether one of them could not be put to even better immediate use by its diversion to frustrate hostile propaganda in the Middle East.

In Majlis July 7th, the Minister of Finance, rehearsed the Iranian Gov ernment’s well known grievances against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and accused the Company of failure to fulfil Article 10, paragraphs 5, 12 (a), 16 (1) and 21 of the concession. According to promises, the Company’s production ought to have risen to 14 million tons instead of diminishing. Govermnent were doing, and would do, all that was necessary. 2. Three^ deputies who followed spoke more violently. One quoted Bahrein (which he described as Iranian property) as disproving the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company’s argument that production is limited by the markets. Only concrete proposal was that the Government should demand either in creased royalty at a fixed rate regardless of the output, or else the abandon ment by the Company of those fields which they cannot exploit to the full. 3. Prime Minister wound up the debate with further assurance of the Government’s action, and a promise to keep Majlis informed. 4. As might be expected, throughout the debate no reference vns made to the arbitration clause. (26) From British Legation, Tehran, No. 102|(81|15|40), dated the 20th August 1940.

I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 33, dated the 21st May 1940 on the subject of the arrest of Mirza Barkat Ali Ahmadi. The full facts of the case, as far as I can ascertain them in the absence in hospital of my inter preter, are as follows :— 2. Mirza Barkat Ah Ahmadi, a British Indian subject, left Abadan for Iraq m 1937, where he obtained employment with the Iraq Petroleum Com- pan&gt;. In March this year he returned to Abadan for a few davs, leaving again for Iraq two months ago. 3. 'When he was emploved by the Anglo-lranian Oil Companv in Abadan previous to l936. Barkat Ali became indebted to Yusuf Ali, originally a British Indian subject, but now a naturalised Persian and merchant in Abadan.4. On 19th May, Barkat All booked a passage on the Fast Mail Steamer s. s. “ Varsova ” to Karachi. The “ Varsova ' called at Abadan on tne same day and, hearing that Barkat Ali was on board, Yusuf Ali went lo demand payment of his dues. Barkat Ali refused to discharge his debts and told Yusuf Ah that as he was now on his way to India he would never recover them. This so incensed Yusuf Ali that he went to the local Court and after showing his receipts, induced them to apply for the surrender of Barkat Aii. The Court requested the Naval Authorities to effect the arrest of Barkat An and a naval oiiicer went on board the “ Varsova ” and demanded his surrender, verbally, from the Master. The latter refused to comply with this order until the naval officer said that the ship would not be allowed to sail, on which the Master asked for a written demand for Barkat Ali. The Naval Officer later produced a letter signed by Major Naghdi, a copy of which is attached, also a translation, and a letter from the Master reporting the incident to me. No Court Order or document with the Court Seal on it was shown to the Master. Barkat Ali was removed in custody and the “ Varsova ” sailed. 5. Barkat Ali, on arrival in Abadan, was released on bail by the police, the bail being produced by YMsuf Ali, his accuser. The Abadan police are justifiably puzzled at this action of Y T usuf Ali’s. 6. The case between Yusuf Ali and Barkat Ali is presumably a civic one, to be decided in Court, but, as stated in my telegram, I am not clear whether the local Court and the Naval Authorities were justified in removing a British subject by force from, a British ship, even though that ship was tied up to the jetty in Abadan and therefore presumably within the jurisdiction of the local Court, when the charge against him was only one of debt and not a criminal charge. Even if this was legal, the procedure seems irregular as the surrender was demanded on the production of an ordinary letter from a Naval Officer and not on an official document from the Local Court. 7. I am sending copy of this to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (No. 26), and the lion Tie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (No. 425). Sub-Enclosure I to Serial No. (31). P.

A copy of this despatch and enclosure is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ; the Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office ; the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department ; His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad ; and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo. Sub-Enclosure to Serial No. (32). Beport by Press Attache to British Legation, Tehran, No. (218|11|40), DATED THE 7tH SEPTEMBER 1940. I have the honour to refer you to my despatch of 17th July and to trans mit to you the following report on recent trends of public opinion in Iran. 2. Pro-German feeling, for the same reasons as formerly, is still pre dominant, A German victory continues to be regarded on the whole as both likely and desirable. Hitler’s speech on 4th September, however, seems to have created amongst certain sections of the local public a bad impression and made them wonder whether the course of the war, after all, is going as well as it might. 3. German propaganda regarding the origins of the war (such as the German and Italian right to colonies, the so-called injustices of the treaty of y ersallies, the selfish desires oi the decadent democracies to hold back young and virile nations, etc.), are generally accepted. The view that if the Polish corridor had been given to Germany there would have been no war is also fre quently expressed. 4. German publicity by means of the wireless, cinema and ‘press is effective. Ihe I ersian broadcast from Berlin is no longer permitted in hotels and other public places, and moreover its novelty has somewhat w T orn-off, so that its effect is less strong than it was when the broadcast first began ; nevertheless all, or nearly all, Persians who have private wireless sets listen in to it regularly and are inevitably affected by it. UFA news-reels with Persian commentary of a strongly propagandist nature are exerting at the moment considerable influence on pub he opinion in favour of Germany. German periodicals, such as “ Signal” and others, are also widely read and have a pernicious influence There aie unfortunately no allied periodicals on sale locally which can compare in he appeal they make to the local public. Further German puhHcaW have PrituT ad ™. nt ^ e of arri ™g while they are still up to date wherels British periodicals are months old by the time they arrive.

Of all classes, perhaps the army is the most strongly influenced by Oerman propaganda. The defeat of France has served greatly to strengthen Their respect for the German military machine. Military circles were taught by the French military mission to regard the French army as invincible, and the fact that Germany has succeeded in defeating the French army so quickly has impressed them immensely. It may be mentioned that the German illustrated periodical “ Signal ” has a wide circulation in army circle, where it is read with interest. 9. The attitude towards Great Britain is marked by two main features. On the one hand there is, among a minority, a slight tendency to think that we may, perhaps, after all, not be beaten, but this has not yet advanced to a belief in the possibility of a German defeat. On the other hand our un popularity grows in measure as that of the Shah increases, since we are held responsible for him (see below). 10. There is also a very small minority who, discounting German accounts of their successes, see that German attacks on the United Kingdom have so far failed, and fear that Germany will turn away from the west to the east. Consequently any satisfaction that those who are pro-British might have felt at this is tempered by a fear that as a result of British resistance the war may spread to the Middle East. 11. As regards general feeling towards Russia, various tendencies can be observed. The Shah is said to be dissatisfied with the working of the Russo-lranian trade agreement. This may well be the case. Moreover the Iranian transport and transit mission sent to Russia has, as far as is known, failed to date to achieve any results. 12. The official classes and merchants still regard Russia with fear and distaste. The lower classes, however, and to some extent the middle classes also, seem to have lost their fear of Russia and to regard the possibility of Russian intervention with calm and resignation, if not with some hope, on the grounds that their lot could noUbe worse under Russian domination and might be better. The younger intellectuals also, partly in despair, tend towards Russia. 13. Russian propaganda has increased recently, and seeks to show how pleasant life is in Russia, and how happy the people. Russian films are being pushed in the local cinemas with the help of the police authorities. As yet, however nothing of a directly propagandist nature has been shown. Russian films’ incidentally, are highly popular, chiefly owing to the fact that the Russian language is widely known locally. It is probable the Russians are also carry- mg on surreptitious propaganda against the democracies, but I have no direct evidence of this. U. Italy has little, if any, effect on the reactions of the general public to the war. She is on tlm whole despised, and tends to be ignoted. The African campaign, m spite of the dynastic connection between Egypt and Iran has failed, so far, to capture public interest, 1 ’ Id. The internal situation has worsened noticeably during the last two months. Discontent against the regime is becoming stronger and more onen. eports from the provinces indicate that this applies to the whole country there has been a arge increase in the secret police recently, which is signi- licant. It is not, however, suggested that this discontent is likely to break out into rebellion unless external events create some new factor in the situation hi ™ ] ™ re a® in £ dls content reacts unfavourably on our position. The whole blame for the Shah s oppression is placed on our shoulders by educated and uneducated alike. This largely accounts, as pointed out in earlier despatches for the anti-Bntish and pro-German feelings of the Iranian people. 1 (33) From British Legation, Tehran, No. 124[(21S|14|40), dated the 18th October 1940.

I have the honour to refer to my despatch No. 218|11|40, of 7th September and to transmit to you the following report. 2. While there is little diminution in pro-German feeling, the tendency among the minority to think that Great Britain may not be beaten is stronger and spreading somewhat. It has been noticed, especially in Tabriz, which was one of the'places most strongly under German influence, that there is a tendency to view our chances more favourably. 3. The reaction to the German-Italo-Japanese agreement was at first unfavourable to us. When, however, no material change in the situation was seen to result from this, public opinion swung round to the view that Japan had made an error in concluding an agreement from which she would get no advantage. A few saw in the agreement weakness on the part of Germany, in that, in spite of her much vaunted strength, she was turning to Japan for help. . 4. The reaction to the German occupation of Rumania has been calm. It is attributed by the public in general to a desire on the part of Germany to assure herself of Rumanian oil supplies. It is not considered to involve any material change in the situation, since it is argued that Germany was already in \iitual control of Rumania. Wishful thinking leads the public to attribute the German move also to an intention to block any further advance by Russia. A small minority are fearful lest these events should lead to an extension of the war area in the Near and Middle East. 5. The belief is growing that America will enter the war. This amounts m pro-Ally circles almost to a certainty that America will make a declaration as soon as the presidential election is over. Should the election pass and no such development follow, there is likely to be disappointment and perhaps also a reaction in opinion unfavourable to us. Pro-German circles consider Ilia: ii America does decide to enter the war, Japan will keep her fully occu pied^ There is a further tendency on the part of those who, while not stronglv pro-German, yet beheve that Germany will win the war, to regret the pos- Ribihty of the entry of America into the war on the ground that it would lead ? 1of . tlie . w . ar arca aiKl the prolongation of the war, in other Germany fAmenCa;,0mS in ’ Britain wiI1 not be so soon disposed of by G.

There is also on the nurf. wardTlran. 11 6mpt ° mdiCate that slie is actnafcd P friendly feelings to-8. The Armenian community, and in particular the Dashnak party, are divided among themselves. The local leaders of the Dashnak party are losing ground in their efforts to keep the party pro-Ally. In Tehran there is a tendency for the party to turn to Russia, for this reason that they are beginning to see in Russia the only hope of help for the restoration of an independent Armenia. In this connection it might be mentioned that the ^Erivan radio station has recently taken an unusual interest in pro-Bolshevik Armenian revolutionary and nationalist writers. This among other things cannot fail to arouse in Armenians the memory of the hardships they suffered under the Turks. On the other hand, in Tabriz, where there is a large Armenian minority, the Dashnak party as a whole are strongly hostile to Russia and pro- German almost to a man. 9. The following notes u'pon the situation in the province of Azerbaijan which, in view of the possible advance of Germany from the Balkans eastwards holds, by virtue of its geographical situation, a not unimportant position, may be of interest. They are not intended to be a complete account of the situa tion in Azerbaijan, being merely a few observations made during a brief visit :— (a) (b) (c) (d) It is hardly necessary to state that Azerbaijan with its predomi nantly Turkish population differs somewhat from the rest of Iran. The population generally are more hardworking and thrifty than elsewhere in Iran, and the proportion of leading men in public life who are Turkish or partly Turkish is high. Efforts have been and are being made under the present regime to per- sianize the province. It is doubtful how far these have been successful. The Azerbaijan still refers to himself as a Turk {Azerbaijani and not “ Osmanli ”) and not a Persian, but on the other hand the Persian language seems to be more widely under stood in Tabriz than it was some few years ago. High local officials such as the governor are almost invariably chosen by the central government from among non-Azerbaijanis. The Shah is said, possibly with some truth, to have a dislike for Azerbaijan and to give little help to the province. In any case less has been done for Tabriz than other leading towns in the way of modernisation of buildings and streets so dear to the Shah’s heart, and the potential riches of the province appear to have been little developed. This may be due not only to a personal antipathy for Azerbaijan on the part of the Shah but also to a fear lest a flourishing Azerbaijan should attract the cupidity of her neighbours, Turkey and Russia. In spite of this neglect there is an air of prosperity to be seen in Tabiiz in comparison, that is to say, with the generally miserable condition of other Persian towns. This may be due to a variety of causes, among them the thrift of the population, a relatively flourishing merchant class, a number of factories (some of which have been established for some years), transit and other trade with Germany and Russia, and possibly also a greater freedom from interference from the capital. The German colony in Azerbaijan is numerous. It is well orga nised and active. German influence among the official classes, civil and military, locally is strong, while many key points in the industrial life of the province are held by Germans. It is stated by reliable sources that a considerable amount of money is ex pended by the Germans in propaganda. There is a well-organised whispering campaign ; its immediate objects appear to be to stir up discontent against the Pahlevi regime and to encourage the be lief that the Shah is the tool of the British and impress the popula tion with German might and the certainty of German victory in the war A recent instance of their methods is offered by the bread shortage m the province. In the spring of this vear, there was a serious shortage of bread in the province owing to the fact that grain had been removed bv the Government Wheat Mono poly to other parts of Iran. This autumn a serious shortage again occurred, and this time it appears to have been due in part to sabotage, probably at German instigation. The people were42 in an angry mood over the shortage and disorder threatened. The governor and also the chief of the municipality were finally summoned to Tehran at the beginning of the month, and the former dismissed. On their departure the bread situation at once returned almost to normal both as regards quantity and quality. Whether the shortage was actually engineered by the Germans or not, they made good use of it in their whispering campaign against the Shah and the British. (e) It is perhaps not without interest that the German organisation in Azerbaijan -was carefully overhauled in the period April to June of this year. The German consul went to Berlin, ostensibly on leave. He was replaced by one Leverkuehn, said to be a high Nazi official and even a personal friend of Hitler, who tightened up and overhauled the Nazi party organisation in Azerbaijan during this period. _ Recently the German minister also paid a visit to Tabriz. It is said the purpose of his visit was to en quire whether the expenditure of funds on propaganda was com mensurate with the results obtained. (f) As regards the attitude of the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan, see paragraph 8 above. (g) Russians in Azerbaijan are not numerous, nor as far as can be ascertained are they unduly active. It is thought, however, that in the event of trouble the lower classes, at least, would turn to Russia rather than to Germany. (h) The attitude towards Turkey of the official classes in Azerbaijan, v hose higher ranks are, as stated above, drawn from other parts of Iran, is one of the utmost suspicion, on account of a widespread belief that Turkey would like to incorporate Azerbaijan within f J 01 J tiers - Th. 1 ? belief is perhaps in part due to the attitude of the Azerbaijanis themselves, who tend to stress the tact that they are Turks and not Persians. It should not be thought, however, that they would necessarily, in fact, welcome incorporation m Turkey ; and it should also be borne in mind that there is a considerable difference between the “ Osmanli ” Turk and the Azerbaijan Turk.

A. F. concentrates upon economic targets, receives little attention ; the adverse elfect of these operations on Germany’s war potential is largely ignored, whereas the heavy damage inflicted, for example on Coventry ana Southampton, by German raid^ makes a great impression on the public. This difference is largely due to. the fact that Germany’s feats are explained and exaggerated by wireless bulletins in Persian—a form of propaganda which we hope to see in use by the B. B. C. very shortly. 3. Interest in the Greco-Italian war is growing, as also the appreciation of Greek successes. This is probably due to various causes. The Italians are generally despised and disliked. Secondly, the victory of a small state over a larger one cannot but fail to be encouraging to Iran, who has periodically felt herself menaced by great powers. Further, with the Italians being pushed back by the Greeks the war is, at least temporarily, receding from Iran rather than getting closer. Lastly, it must be remembered that the natural tendency of the Iranian is to side with the victor, whoever he may be. 4. In Tehran it is realised that Britain has given and is giving considerable help to the Greeks, which has had a favourable effect on our prestige. Reports from the provinces, however, suggest that this realisation is not widespread outside the capital. 5. The successful operations in the Western Desert will no doubt re inforce the favourable effect of the Greek campaign. As yet it is rather too early to report on local reactions. The good impression created by recent events should not, however, be over-estimated ; it does not extend beyond a rather limited number of persons, chiefly in official circles. The Near East is considered only as a minor theatre of the war. It is widely thought that the main war theatre is the west and that it is there that the final decision will be reached. The defeat_ of Italy is not, therefore, considered to be of great im portance. The view is expressed that Italy is a burden rather than a help to Germany, and that her disappearance as a belligerent would not weaken the latter’s position. Many are of the opinion that Germany is allowing Italy to suffer setbacks in order to be able, at the critical moment/to step in and rescue her, and so to reduce her to complete sub-ordination. 6. The intellectual classes tend to take their reaction from the French, and are not favourably impressed with our chances of victory. They are more over strongly influenced against us by their ever-growing hatred of the Shah who, as 1 have repeatedly stated, is regarded as being maintained in power by the British. 1 7. Financial and commercial circles are also hostile to us. The British failure to produce an effective commercial policy for Iran has convinced them that we are weak and have little chance of winning the war. The unfortunate impression has also been created that we do not really wish to help Iran. This has naturally reinforced the tendency, already strong for a variety of reasons described in former despatches, to turn to Germany. As opposed to our lack of a comrnercial plan in Iran, the Germans have achievements to show* At tlie beginning of the war, under the Irano-German cleafing agreement Ger many owed Tran some 44,000,000 Rm. As a result of recent negotiations in ilerlin the balance of German indebtedness to Iran under the clearing agree- ment has been wiped off, though it is true that most of the goods covered by the balance have still to be delivered. The effect of this upon the Iranian when compared with the absence of any result of British commercial activity it is hardly necessary to dwell upon. The desire of the Iranian is to continue his normal existence untouched and unaffected by the war ; anything which dis turbs this is resented What interests him is to obtain the goods he requires Trhnia ^ that Great Britam cannot spare him anything because her whole effort is concentrated upon her own war production. Germany recog nises this, and although the arrival of German goods in Iran is irregular and s 16 is unable to fulfil all Iranian demands, yet goods of a kind do arrive. 8. Anything effecting Russia is of paramount importance in determining local opinion and perhaps the most important development as regards public ooimon concerns the reaction to events in the Balkans which have followed Molotov’s Visi to Berlin. At the time of this event, a state of panTpre J ailed among the upper and middle classes and in official circles. Nviien no immediate changes followed this visit, opinion was reassured. The generalview was that Russia had refused to come to an agreement with Germany for tne division of tne Middle East, and that Bulgaria, in adopting a firmer atti tude towards Germany, and also Turkey, were acting under Russian direc tion. 9. The reaction of the local population to foreign affairs is far from be ing logical and does not as a rule extend beyond the immediate future. Russia and Great Britain are still regarded as the traditional enemies of Iran, and this is, perhaps, the strongest and most constant factor determining local reaction to’foreign affairs. Germany under Hitler was from the first regard ed as hostile to Bolshevik Russia, and in spite of the Russo-German agree ment that belief, in general, is maintained in a somewhat modified form. Hence she is regarded as a counterweight to both of the powers^ who are traditionallv regarded as hostile to Iran. In the past Great Britain and Russia had been played off by the Persians against each other. In Germany the Persians saw a friendly power, hostile to both of Iran’s traditional ene mies, and thus believed that she would first defeat one of these, namely Great Britain, and would then restrain the other. The idea therefore that Germany might make a favourable political agreement with Russia came as a shock to local opinion, and when it appeared that this plan (if indeed it had ever exist ed) had not succeeded relief was great. It was nevertheless not accompanied, as might have been expected, by a reaction against Germany. The indica tions that Russia had no designs in the immediate future on Iran, but was rather looking westward and supporting the independence of Bulgaria and Turkey were welcomed. Lastly, the evidence of a tendency towards a rapprochement between Britain and Russia did not create the alarms that the possibility of a political agreement between Germany and Russia had done, but, was, on the contrary, and perhaps somewhat illogically, favourably viewed. This was largely because it was considered that neither side would be pre pared to allow the other at this moment to gain a dominant position in Iran, and that therefore Iran was, for the moment, safe. The belief that Iran occupies a position of paramount importance in our scheme for the defence of India dies hard, and it is generally believed that Britain will not, if she can help it, tolerate the establishment of Russia in Northern Iran, while she her self, being a satisfied power and elsewhere fully occupied, does not, at least for the moment, threaten Iran, whereas a Russo-German combination would do so immediately, both powers having shown their readiness to incorporate foreign countries within their own domains.

Imports show an increase, principally due to large imports of cotton piece goods from Germany and Japan, and railway material. German im ports were large, whereas practically none came from the U. S. S. R. As re gards exports, Germany easily retains the first place, dried fruits being the principal commodities furnished to Germany. 3.
